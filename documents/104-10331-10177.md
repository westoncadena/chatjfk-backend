# 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SUBJECT: Re: Slug (*AQUATIC*)

The Agency agreed to release slug lines in 1995 (one of the first battles with the ARRB). Since "Aquatic" was used in the slug line of documents dealing with photo operations in Mexico City it has been released in documents at NARA. We have been advised by the ARRB staff that unless we can show "current harm" to additional releases they will not accept the protection of "Aquatic" in slug lines. If you with to take the issue to the Board at the 6 Aug. meeting, I will need an evidence memo no later than 5 August.

The specific document in question deals with fabrication of Cuban passport. The ARRB staff has agreed to accept our redactions under the previous agreement on alias documentation. If you want a DS&T look, I recommend you have Tony F. review the document. If you want to review other files/document related to "Aquatic", I suggest you come to IP to review.

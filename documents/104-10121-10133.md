The documentation will be used for a Cuban diplomat recruitment. Subject can not use his other registered aliases (for which he has supporting pocket litter) since one is a registered name for BKHERALD identification, another is used in conjunction with his Mexican passport and the third was extensively used during his JMWAVE tour and may be compromised. Attached is an ID photograph to be used on the Special Representative document. Request expedite handling for this request which is being hand carried.

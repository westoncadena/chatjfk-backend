| Helms, Richard<br>Leyland Bus Co. | 1962   | Castro<br>Mongoose |

OCCURRENCE: Helms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba, lets put it that way, and no limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recal having been told by anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very intense and I remember vividly it was very intense.". The pressure led to several very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Pigs and then lay dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and 1962. The Cuban Missile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity. Afterwards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving "economic warfare" such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries including an attempt to stop the sale by theLeyland Bus Company in Spain of buses to

Specific references made to the pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick.

OCCURRENCE:

Harvey states that the estimated cost of CIA in terms of personnel assigned full-time to Operation Mongoose would have to be increased to at least **600** (if stage two of Mongoose went into effect) and that the estimated fiscal budgets for 1963 and 1964 would have to be increased to over **$100 million**.

OCCURRENCE:

Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE'S
suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to
the-U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He men-
tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures by the introduction
of biological agents which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that
he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear
as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must
avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could.

OCCURRENCE: When RFK asked Helms for his comments, Helms stated that "we were prepared to get on with the new action program and that we would execute it agressively."
Helms pointed out, however, that the objective of Operation MONGOOSE would have to be determined at some point since the Cubans with whom we have to work were seeking a reason for risking their lives in these operations. Helms detailed his conversation with the young Cuban from the DRE) who pointed out that they were willing to commit people only on operations which they regarded as sensible. Helms defines sensible in Cuban terminology as meaning an action which would contribute to the liberatic of their country, another way of saying that the United States, perhaps in conjunction with other Latin American countries, would bail them out militarily. Helms' point was specially echoed by Huston and Ryan.

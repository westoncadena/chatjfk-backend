Action: FYI

1. Forwarded herewith is a contact report from PACHANKIS on his follow-up interview of Alexander SAMKO (201-866054), which concerns SAMKO's contact with AMAUTO/1 (201-735296) in Madrid. As can be seen from the report, Madrid Station's defensive briefing of SAMKO apparently took effect and he has been cautious in avoiding the many suspicious characters that have appeared since his trip to Madrid.

2. The question of his writing to AMAUTO/1 was mentioned by SAMKO. He was told that AMAUTO/1 was back in Cuba and we did not know when he would return to Madrid, if ever. /Miami believes we should wait until AMAUTO/1 returns to Madrid, or some other post in the Free World, and then have SAMKO write to him.

3. Despite SAMKO's newly self-discovered James Bond talents PACHANKIS enjoyed handling him. It also appears that our prisary objective, contact with AMAUTU/! for a face to face assessment, has been met.

29 July 1970

Contact Report on Alexander SAMKO, on 28 July 1970.

1. On the morning of 28 July, I called Sam to check in with him after being away on TOY for almost 6 weeks. He sounded a bit upset at not being contacted during this period, so I dashed out to his Hollywood home to explain what had happened and set him at ease.

2. It was plain to see that the trip had changed him. He is now a bit presumptuous, cocky, and know it all James Bond. He told me all sorts of wild stories about being tailed in Madrid "by 7 or 8 'Chivatos' (Castro agents," and leading them on long "8 or 9 mile hikes through Madrid." Castro agents were also "watching" him on the day he was in Barcelona and on the short layover his Pan Am plane had in Lisbon on his way home. At no time, however, was he molested by these "agents."

3. The Castro surveillance continued -so Sam says- in Hollywood. "About the second night after I got home," c. 14-15 June, a car parked across the street and a little to the rear of his house "after it got dark." When Sam got into his car and went to the gas station, the car -described as looking like a white Volkswagen, without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trip in the neighborhood and back to his home. He could not make out the physical description of the driver of the VW. He has never seen this car again.

4. The only other suspicious individual near his home, was "a tall, thin man," (described as about 5-11 to 6 ft and 170 lbs; black hair; no distinguishing features visible; once wearing slacks and white shirt, another time wearing a suit). This individual showed up across the street from his home "just as the sun had gone down, several evenings during the first week that I got home." (c. 14-18 June) The man just walked past the front back and forth a few times and appeared to have his car around the corner of Sam's house. He could not identify the car or anything else about the man.

5. Again, during the first week after his return Sam received several telephone calls where no one would answer when the phone was picked up, or the person calling would say, "sorry, wrong number." Sam has not experienced any other suspicious incidents after the first week home from Spain. I should note that Sam does not talk of these incidents with fear, but rather in the vein of a paperback detective story.

6. Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himself somewhat in Madrid as a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxury hotel, ate as well as drank well, saw the sites and even went to a night club, all on the house. He went so far as to say that if he had "known'it was going to be like this, I never would have gone." Yet, in the same breath, he told "William" that he would be back in Spain in September. Of course, Sam would go again if we asked him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

7. "but, only to help my country." (With "Patriots" like Sam, how can we lose.)

Sam is most anxious to start some correspondence to "William." He says "William" asked him to send him some photos of Cape Kennedy and some smoked shrimp. Sam wants to know if we want to supply him with photos of the Cape that he can send. Sam states he will write anything we wish. I promised to check out the status of the case with my office and Madrid to see what course of action they deem should be initiated.

8. Modesty not being one of his greatest virtues Sam rambled and rambled about the "secrets" he got out of "William" and passed on to the Madrid c/o. I went along with him and complimented him on a job well done; which is true. But, he was not satisfied with my plaudits, he wanted to know "What Washington said?" To which I said, "everyone, Washington, Madrid and Miami thought you did an excellent. job and we are most grateful for your cooperation." He liked that very much; you could see it in the smile on his face. He tries to make it sound like it was a great ordeal and sacrifice on his part to go to Spain to see "William," but he cannot hide his anxiety to get on the next plane to Madrid, and the good life there.

9. I pointed out that "William" is now back in Cuba and there is no indication of when he will return. Nevertheless, Sam feels he should write him "because the letter will be sent to Cuba to him." I assured him that I would get a reading on this matter and have an answer for him sometime next week. At that time, I promised to take him and his close friend Masip to lunch. Sam gave me an extensive and expensive expense account of his trip. I will attempt to decipher it at the close of this report.

10. We ended the meeting on very cordial terms. He was not so mad at not being contacted so much as he is dying to get back on the gravy train, and so much time has passed by without word to or from "William." Sam asked for some way in which he can contact us "right away" if "William" notifies him "that he's ready to jump. You know when he jumps he won't have much time." I pointed out that at present "William" is in Cuba and the prospects of him defecting from Cuba right now are very slim indeed. We would, however, take this into consideration after "William" returns to Spain or another foreign post. We will be seeing each other next week to clear up the accounting (we owe him money, he says) and have lunch.

Henry S. PACHANKIS.

C Details of Meetings between SAMKO and AMAUTO-1

References: A. MADRID 1261

B. MADRID 1287

1. Alexander SAMKO arrived in Madrid on 30 May and was met by the undersigned at 1700 hours in his hotel room. SAMKO does not know the true name of the undersigned. He quickly complained of his flight and said never before has he flown on a "cattle plane" and avowed never again to fly Aeronaves de Mexico. PACHANKIS correctly assessed him as a querulous person. The undersigned was mentally prepared for his comments regarding the flight, the bad food served on the plane, and, much later in the week, the hotel room, Madrid in general and, because of the language barrier, his one-plate diet of steak and potatoes. He said his return trip would be through London where he expected to fly the Boeing 747 to New York. SACODER interrupted him and said that we had-other plans for him and his only reply was "oh!". Beneath his rough exterior and use of the vernacular, which is indeed spicy, SAMKO is a loveable person who has an infinite number of anecdotes. Although he had no children, he gives the impression of being a good, grandfatherly type who could easily put anyone in a nostalgic mood. After leaving the room we continued the conversation in the hotel bar. SACODER reviewed the cover stories and went through a series of do's and don'ts; i.e., do try to establish a channel between SAMKO and AMAUTO-1; don't hesitate to accept an invitation to visit AMAUTO-1's office, failing all other means to meet with him; do try to invite him out alone to a restaurant for dinner or to a bar for a drink; do accept an invitation to have dinner at his home; don't hint to your sponsorship for this trip. He had no objections to the cover stories, but embellished them to his liking with

appropriate references to his deceased spouse, the fact that "Jūlio" was always jealous of AMAUTO-1 and his doctor's orders to take a vacation to relieve his mind of the recent death of his wife. After several rehearsals SAMKO would have convinced anyone of the purpose of his visit to Europe. He did_an_outstanding-job-throughout-the-operation.

2. On the evening of 30 May SAMKO and SACODER dined at an out-door restaurant. We spent another three hours rehearsing his cover story, reviewing the objectives and trying to anticipate questions AMAUTO-1 might ask during their meeting together. SAMKO was given the following objectives:

a. The foremost objective was for SAMKO to renew and improve upon his relationship with AMAUTO-1, to the extent that they would be able to reminisce, over a prolonged period, about the relationship that existed before AMAUTO-I's departure from the United States.

b. To exchange addresses and telephone numbers for the purpose of sending occasional greetings to one another.

c. To invite AMAUTO-1 (and his wife, if necessary) to dinner, at his expense.

d. To ascertain AMAUTO-1's future plans.

e. To assess ANAUTO-1's feelings toward the United States and toward his own government.

f. For SAMKO to talk favorably about the United States using himself as an example, (the son of immigrant parents who made good in business); to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone with imagination, ambition and aggressiveness.

g. If the opportunity presented itself, to show sympathy for the apparent failure of the Cuban Government to reach the 10 million ton sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment of this goal would adversely affect the economic development of Cuba. It was our hope that some- time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would volunteer to discuss his country's economic situation which might have opened the conversation to further exploitation by SAMΚΟ.

h. Parallel with objective e. above, SAMKO was instructed to ask (provided an appropriate opening appeared in the conversation) AMAUTO-1 for his personal comments on the Vietnam issue and anti-war demonstrations in the United States and abroad. We were trying to draw out AMAUTO-1's personal analysis of the U.S. position vis-a-vis the war in Vietnam and to compare his statements with the Cuban Government position.

3. Although SAMKO was determined to see AMAUTO-1 even if he had to camp outside AMAUTO-1's home, we reminded him that because of AMAUTO-1's position, he might refuse to see SAMKO in his home, but that SAMKO should not hesitate to

accept any reasonable invitation to be with AMAUTO-1. When SAMKO approached AMAUTO-1's home we had a stroke of luck. First, one-of AMAUTO-1's children was in the front yard playing, and two, the door to the driveway was open, thus SAMKO was able to enter the front yard. Under separate cover for CWHD and COS, Miami we are forwarding photographs taken during the initial meeting between SAMKO and AMAUTO-1. The pictures were taken from the home of one of our staffers. We believe they highlight the events leading to the reunion of these two old friends. The following is a description of each photo:

PHOTO A: SANKO arrives at AMAUTO-1's home at 1150 hours, 31 May 1970. (Although not shown, KENTLAND and SACODER were monitoring AMAUTO-1's home from 0900 hours on 31 May so that, in the event AMAUTO-1 decided to leave before SAMKO'S arrival, we could instruct: SAMKO by phone to delay his departure.)

B: After trying to enter via the front gate, SAMKO called to one of the children who was playing in the front yard. The child told him to go to the garage entrance. SAMKO walks toward that entrance.

C: The boy apparently called for someone in the house. A maid, not shown in this photo, but who can be seen in photo L, came out and approached SAMKO. In his halting Spanish, SAMKO said he wanted to see "el Senor". The maid said he wasn't in. He explained to the maid that it was "very importante" to see the Senor. By this time another maid appeared, shown in this photo, and she gets into the act. She repeats that el Senor is not in. SAMKO, sensing he wasn't getting anywhere, changed his tactics and asked to see "la senora". The maids went into indivi- dual monologues, but SAMKO could not understand what they were saying. Finally, SAMKO produced a note, which he was asked to prepare, and handed it to the maid in this photo. SAMKO repeated that it was "very importante to see el Senor."

D: The maid accepts the note and returns to the house. Three of AMAUTO-1's children observe the activities from the front entrance.

E: AMAUTO-1 exits, with note in hand and looks toward the driveway. SAMKO spots him and calls out, "Bill, don't you remember me, it's SAMKO." Bill replies, "SAMKO, muy bien, come here, come here." Actually, AMAUTO-I goes toward SAMKO and they embrace. (The driveway slants toward the house and from our observation post we could not see the embrace.)

F: AMAUTO-1 accompanies SAMKO into the house, arm in arm. As they go SAMKO tells AMAUTO-1 that he put on weight and asked where his boy was. AMAUTO-1 replies that he's rich because all these kids are his (pointing to the three boys).

G: Same as F, above.

H: After a brief talk in the house, the AMAUTOS and SAMKO return to the driveway where they snapped some pictures. AMAUTO-1 is impressed with SAMKO's' Polaroid and they exchange comments on their cameras.

I: AMAUTO-1 helps move the baby carriage through the gates. This is his newest and sixth child.

J: Same as I, above.

K: Maid takes baby out for a stroll. This is a new maid.

L: A picture of the new maid. (Might prove helpful for future identification in the event we resume our operation against AMAUTO-1's residence.)

M: AMAUTO-1 prepares to open both gates to remove his new Alfa-Romeo.

N: Same. Notice AMAUTO-l's high forehead. He has lost a considerable amount of hair since his arrival in December 1967.

O: AMAUTO-1's wife enters the picture; also, another one of his sons.

P: SAMKO's still taking pictures. He gave the pictures to AMAUTO-l to avoid casting any suspicions. (SACODER ran out of film here, but AMAUTO-1 removes his Alfa from the garage. The car still carries Italian license plates. The AMAUTOS, SAMKO and the kids get in the car and leave for the amusement park located at the Casa del Campo. )

4. During the conversation in AMAUTO-1's home, SAMKO began his deliberate softening of AMAUTO-1 with such comments as "you know Bill, Julio was jealous of you because I treated you like a brother. I didn't want you to return to Cuba, but I couldn't stop you. We were all in favor of Castro." Bill admitted here that SAMKO was a good friend and enjoyed his job and the pay was good, but added that "I had to go. I was in the States illegally." SAMKO added "you know, Bill, I never was blessed with any children; you were like a son to me, but when I heard you died in the mountains in Cuba, I blamed myself for letting you go." Bill replied that he was wounded on his left side. SAMKO explained that if AMAUTO-1 was in the States illegally, SAMKO could have arranged for him to remain in the States by getting assistance from some police and detective friends in Florida. SAMKO repeated his delight to again see AMAUTO-1 and how happy he was to know he is alive.

5. Moments after entering the house, AMAUTO-1 invited him to have breakfast. SAMKO refused, but settled for a beer. AMAUTO-1 excused himself, went to the phone and called an unidentified party, SAMKO could not understand the conver- sation, but SAMKO and Station officers suspect that he called his embassy or one of his colleagues., possibly advising him of SAMKO's presence.

called the embassy to-advise the duty officer that he
(AMAUTO-1) would be leaving for the Amusement Park. There
were no QUTIMID reports supporting this theory.). The fact
that the telephone call was made soon after SAMKO's arrival
leads us to suspect that the call was made to establish a
surveillance of SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 at the park. As noted
in references SAMKO was specifically briefed on this possi-
bility and was alerted to report any absence of AMAUTO-1
from the room.

6. We were confident that AMAUTO-1 would be the first
   to ask the cover questions, but instead his wife asked both
   questions: What are you doing here? and How did you get our
   address? SAMKO repeated the cover story and at the end of
   the second - how did you get our address - AMAUTO-1 said that it
   was quite possible. (AMAUTO-1's wife remained cool and sus-
   picious throughout the initial confrontation, but later reacted
   warmly toward SAMKO.) As we noted above, SAMKO embellished the
   story to his satisfaction. He also shed a few tears when he
   repeated the story of his wife's death and the doctor's'
   recommendation that he take a vacation. He continued his
   softening approach of AMAUTO-1 by adding: "Bill, when my wife
   took ill some years ago, she asked me to divest myself of all
   business interests, but if you were there with me, Bill, you
   could have handled my affairs and you might have been a
   millionaire today." SAMKO sensed that AMAUTO-1 and his wife
   were moved by this comment and were literally drooling with
   the thought of being millionaires. The wife asked a number
   of questions regarding SAMKO's wealth, his real estate activity,
   collection of silver and his success in general. The wife
   was astounded with the simple explanation of how SAMKO went
   about building and financing apartment houses. SAMKO made
   a suggestion that AMAUTO-1 invest in silver because the scarcity
   of this metal would eventually raise the market value. He
   explained to AMAUTO-1 that he was collecting all silver coins
   stamped prior to 1965. The next couple of hours were spent
   at the amusement park where, on arrival, AMAUTO-1 steered
   SAMKO to a cafeteria near the main entrance. In short order
   two men arrived on the scene, friends of AMAUTO-1. They were
   introduced to SAMKO, but SAMKO could not remember the names.
   After a few moments a couple arrived and they, too, were
   introduced to SAMΚΟ. (SAMKO could not identify the persons
   he met from the photographs in our mug book.) AMAUTO-1's
   friends took a number of photographs of SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 and
   after a short while together, they left. The conversation at
   the park was aimless. They discussed the kids and SAMKO repeated
   how delighted and proud he was to know that one of AMAUTO-1's
   children was named Alexander - his namesake. AMAUTO-1 had
   a wide grin while SAMKO was talking about Alexander. He asked
   AMAUTO-1 about the oldest boy. AMAUTO-1 replied that the oldest
   was in Havana studying civil engineering. SAMKO suggested to
   AMAUTO-1 that he should give his children the best education and
   have them stay away from politics and political courses but
   concentrate on the professional fields, engineering, law,
   medicine, etc. AMAUTO-1 admitted that his intention was to
   keep his children away from a political career. SAMKO said he
   would send Alexander some commercial slides of Cape Kennedy
   and other points of interest in Florida.

7. While still at the park SAMKO said he hoped AMAUTO-1 would get an assignment to the United Nations so that AMAUTO-1 would have an opportunity to visit SAMKO in Florida. AMAUTO-1 was thrilled with this idea and SAMKO's offer. SAMKO said his eyes glowed while AMAUTO-1 pondered this possibility. SAMKO talked about his home and the beach nearby, the climate, his new car, etc. SAMKO's comment on AMAUTO-1's reaction was interesting. He said that beneath AMAUTO-1's communist exterior lies the capitalist. Before leaving the park (AMAUTO-1 had to leave for the airport where he had an appointment to see AMECRU-1), SAMKO said, "Bill", if you ever need me, I'll never let you down. You have a good friend who loves you a lot." SAMKO said he noted some emotional change on Bill's face after this comment.

8. SAMKO was met 48 hours after the contact with AMAUTO-1 in the event AMAUTO-1 decided to put a surveillance on SAMKO. No surveillance was noted when SAMKO was picked up, but on entering the car SAMKO suggested that SACODER keep an eye out for a tail. We drove around town for fifteen minutes. Certain that no one was tailing us, we drove to a Station safehouse which has an underground garage. SAMKO was visibly excited and was enjoying the "cloak and dagger" role, but he was nervous. He was highly impressed with the garage entrance to the safe- house and commended us for being so shrewd and security conscious. He wanted to know whose apartment it was and SACODER said that it was his private "pad". His comment was:"you sure live it up well." As PACHANKIS aptly explained in one of his reports, SAMKO's temper does rise. He was highly excited during the meeting because he was asked to leave the hotel room. Since the reservation was made for four days, he was asked to leave. He pleaded with SACODER to do something to keep him in the hotel room or risk losing the opportunity to lunch with AMAUTO-1 because AMAUTO-1 was to call him at the hotel on Saturday, 6 June. SACODER admitted the error but added that there was a simple solution if he could not convince the hotel manage- ment to allow him to stay a few more days. SACODER suggested that he should explain to the manager that 1) his laundry had not yet returned and 2) he was expecting an important phone call on Saturday and that there was no way of getting in touch with the caller. Failing this, SACODER offered another simple solution. Since SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 had not yet exchanged addresses, SAMKO could return to the AMAUTO-1 home and give the maid a note advising AMAUTO-1 that he had to change hotels. (SAMKO admitted that he told AMAUTO-1 about the possibility of having to leave the hotel because his reservation ended soon.) SAMKO did not at first accept this logic, but SACODER explained that he (SACODER) could not plead with the hotel management on SAMKO's behalf. This was poor security. SAMKO accepted this and after a glass of scotch and water admitted that the solution was indeed simple, but he was terribly excited at first.

9. Throughout the debriefing SAMKO revealed the following: He was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey on 2 November 1907 to Polish parents. At the age of 14-15 he worked as a construction hand on a bridge being built in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. Later, he worked on the construction of the Anhauser Yeast Factory in Oldbridge, New Jersey. He married in 1930. During the hard years, his wife worked in a factory while he roamed the streets looking for employment. In the early 40's he worked for Dupont reportedly on the atomic bomb project, but specifically with U-235. After the war he applied for work with NBC which he thought would be the National Broadcasting Company, but after he filled out his application and was accepted


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

for employment, he learned that it was the National Buscuit Company. He was a master mechanic. He's an ingenious person and has invented several items on which he has patents. Although the years before, during and after the war were difficult, he had the foresight to put his meager savings in real estate. He moved to Florida in the early 50's, reportedly purchased two apartment buildings, but sold them after a year for a $15,000 loss and made some investments in land near the Cape Kennedy area. He was about to begin a multi-million dollar building project on the land, but the NASA complex was moved to Houston and he therefore cancelled his plans and sold the property. While he is not considered wealthy SAMKO lives quite comfortably in retirement. He has a Lincoln continental in the garage and a home valued at about $50,000. Another of his complaints was the way we controlled his purse strings while in Madrid. We put him in a hotel used by many travel agencies which SACODER thought was comfortable, but SAMKO would have preferred the Hilton. He complained of the fact that he was dipping into his own money and was not happy with the idea of keeping receipts (aside from the hotel bills and the airline ticket, SAMKO probably did not keep any receipts). He was advanced $280 in Madrid which will be T/A'd to Miami. Miami should pick up his full tab and might consider buying him a case of scotch as a token of our appreciation for his accomplishments on the assignment, but PACHANKIS probably has learned that a couple of pats on SAMKO's back is sufficient to reward him.

10. Contact was again made with SAMKO on the eve of his possible luncheon engagement with AMAUTO-1. We again reviewed the objectives and he was given a defensive briefing as suggested by WH/Miami. He was told that PACHANKIS probably would not visit with him for about two weeks after his return and that he should not attempt to get in touch with PACHANKIS. He understood why this was necessary and agreed with the briefing. If a luncheon could be arranged, SAMKO was asked to concentrate on the following: (in addition to the requirements he was given before his first meet with AMAUTO-1)

A. Try to ascertain AMAUTO-1's future, his ambitions, his next possible assignment.

B. If possible engage him in a conversation regarding the United States to get his reaction toward our problems.

C. Build up your successes and reflect on how AMAUTO-1 might have achieved similar goals had he remained in the United States.

D. Be alert for any opening to inject questions relating to the Cuban economy vis-a-vis the failure of the "ten million", but to avoid criticism for this failure, and show: sympathy.

11. SAMKO had no difficulty convincing the hotel management that he had to remain in the hotel until Saturday, 6 June. He spoke directly with the manager and told the manager that he was planning to leave on 7 June for Barcelona and would stay at a sister hotel and asked the manager to make reservations for him. The crisis had passed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

12. On the morning of 6 June AMAUTO-1's wife called SAMKO and, in English, said that her husband would pick him up at 1400 hours in front of the hotel. At the appointed hour, AMAUTO-l's official vehicle pulled up in front of the hotel driven by a chauffeur. AMAUTO-1 greeted SAMKO in front of the hotel and after exchanging a few words, they departed for a nearby restaurant. (SAMKO was too preoccupied to make note of the name of the restaurant. We decided against any surveillance during the AMAUTO-1/SAMKO meeting to avoid alerting AMAUTO-1 and/or his staff that the SAMKO visit to Madrid was pre-planned.)

13. At lunch SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 again reminisced. They discussed the following:

A. In one of his references, AMAUTO-1 said that men like him are needed in Cuba and noted that he would probably die fighting for Cuba which is young and aggressive, but that some day it will be a great country; that he has been fighting all his life to relieve the oppressed and repeated that he will die fighting.

(It is interesting to note SAMKO's reaction herè to AMAUTO-1's statement. When SAMKO first visited AMAUTO-1 on 31 May, he was certain that under the facade of being a devoted revolutionary AMAUTO-1 was indeed a capitalist at heart, but at this meeting SAMKO modified his comment by adding that it appears AMAUTO-1 is truly a communist who maintains strong convictions of the righteousness of the revolution. The above comments by AMAUTO-1 produced the peg on which SAMKO could have questioned the veracity of AMAUTO-1's statement on freeing the oppressed, but he was not specifically instructed to maintain a polemic argument on the rights and wrongs of the revolution because we felt this objective was secondary to the re-establishment of a relationship between these two old friends, A future meeting might include the exchange of an objective appraisal of the revolution as seen by SAMKO.)

B. AMAUTO-1 proposed that SAMKO act as an intermediary for the sale of Cuban sea food in the United States. He explained that the Cubans have a large fishing fleet in the Canary Islands. The fish caught is processed in the Canary Islands and can be shipped to the United States as a product of Spain, not of Cuba. AMAUTO-1 added, "SAMKO, you're like a father to me, please think about it (the agency)? AMAUTO-1 explained that SAMKO could earn about $200,000 a year in commission based on sales of $2,000,000. SAMKO said he would think about it, but privately to SACODER he said that he had no intention to disturb his retirement with a fishy business.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

DISPATCH S-K-C-R-E-T OSMA - 26417

C. SAMKO gave AMAUTO-1 a new Kennedy half-dollar which delighted AMAUTO-1.

D. SAMKO told AMAUTO-1 that he expected AMAUTO-1 to be bigger than just an ambassador to Spain. He said, "I want you to get to the United Nations." SAMKO repeated his desire to show AMAUTO-1 his Florida home and spend a few days at the beach with him. AMAUTO-1 again was visibly moved with this idea.

E. SAMKO restated that "Bill, you have a good friend, don't forget it. You are like a son."

F. They exchanged addresses. SAMKO had printed his address, but AMAUTO-1 asked him to write it on another piece of paper. AMAUTO-1 reasoned that he wanted it written to understand it better, but we believe he will use the sample to compare it with letters SAMKO might send in the future. They promised to write to each other. SAMKO was given AMAUTO-1's private address, not that of the embassy.

G. AMAUTO-1 regretted that SAMKO had to leave so soon because he would have enjoyed showing SAMKO the Spanish interior. SAMKO said he might consider returning near the end of 1970, but AMAUTO-1 did not say whether he would be in Spain in late 1970.

H. AMAUTO-1 said he was suspicious when he first saw SAMKO noting that the nature and importance of his position make him act suspicious, but the suspicion soon dissipated - so he said.

14. On saying their last goodbyes at the hotel, both men embraced and again promised to keep in touch through correspondence. At this point the operation was over. SAMKO was met late that evening. He was taken to a new safehouse.

15. Accomplishments: We feel the objectives programmed and rehearsed were successfully fulfilled, perhaps far greater than our own expectations. Unless we are misjudging the shrewdness of AMAUTO-1 through our own naivete, we believe the relationship was sincerely re-established and a channel opened for future use by AMAUTO-1 should he desire to use this channel other than to maintain a friendly correspondence. It was unfortunate that his Barcelona trip interfered possibly to the point of SAMKO having one or two additional meetings with AMAUTO-1 nonetheless, in the six plus hours together, SAMKO admirably fulfilled our requirements and courageously maintained the fiction of his visit to Spain. We believe too, that although AMAUTO-1 appears to be solidly in favor of the Cuban regime, he did not criticize the United States which we feel he might have done had he suspected that SAMKO's visit to Madrid was sponsored by the U.S. Government. AMAUTO-1 has come a long way since his internship as a butcher in the United States and

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

DISPATCH

probably realizes that while he retains a prodigious role in the Cuban Government, he will continue to give his loyalty and devotion to the regime. At the same time, we feel, AMAUTO-1 is an opportunist and might take advantage of the SAMKO channel should the current regime come to an end or his own position jeopardized by the vengeful attitude of his colleagues.

15. We would appreciate PACHANKIS doing the following:

A. Purchase a dozen or so slides of Cape Kennedy and rocket launchings which will be sent to AMAUTO-1's son, Alexander.
SAMKO should prepare a letter to AMAUTO-1 as soon as the purchase is made extending his appreciation to AMAUTO-1 for spending his valuable time with SAMKO and repeating his desire to help in any way possible and not to hesitate doing so.

16. We again would like to extend to SAMKO our appreciation for his support and full cooperation. Also, our thanks to Miami and PACHANKIS for their fine support.

![Signature of Howard R. SACODER]

Howard R. SACODER

P.S. AMAUTO-1 was recalled on 30 June 1970 and his future is uncertain at this time; therefore, we suggest that SAMKO not mail any letters or send any slides to AMAUTO-1 in Madrid.

Roport No. 31. 1- June 1970---

Ruiz diotatos to Wilda: "The Cuban Imbassy groots tho Ninister of Foreign Affairs and has the pleasure to request the corres-ponding-pormission to carry a-pistol, -"Star" 9 mom.short, No.50. 234, which at the present time is being held in the offices of the "Star" factory, in the Plaza do España, for
![photo of the pistol] whose photograph is attached."

Ruiz is talking with a Cuben who is in Madrid on a scholarship.

They are talking of bringing a teacher from Cuba and Ruiz says that this would be very difficult. He says that instruction is given by professors, but education is given by the parents, and what the children will bo depends on this education. Ruiz says that his fathor made him a communist. Of all the children, he was the only one that studiod, but it was his father that formed them all. From the time he was a small child his father gave him books of Lenin to read. These books arrived clandestinoly to Cuba. He remarks about problems his own children have given him. He refers to an incident where one of the children was invited to a First Communion, and speaks of the freedom he gave the child to make his First Communion also, if he wanted to.

Then Ruiz says that his other son "ALEJANDRO, is inclined to romain in Spain, and he is willing to let him if this is what the boy wants. He says that these things have to core fron one's own self, and if they are opposed in these actions it can loave marks on them for the rest of their lives. Ruiz says he gives them the liberty to choose.

Ruiz telk this student with whom he is conversing that Alejandro DE LA NUEZ has gone to the United States, and adds that De La Nuez' wife never came to meetings or reunions that were held at the embassy. She always gave as an excuse that her nerves were bad. Ruiz says that De La Nuez took the money with him.

This comrade (F) left at 12:15. He said goodbye to her very cordially. Apparently around the 29th of the month she is going to Faris.

Later Ruiz entered the office again and put the radio on very loud. He didn't leave the office all morning, but the radio continued to play very loud; so much so that you can hardly tell when anyone goes in or out of the of ice.

Report 345 18 June 1970

Apparently they have received a document in which all the Chiefs of Mission have been called to Cuba for the third week of July, as some of them can make it coincide with their leave. He tells Curbelo that he intends to send Hilda either before or after he leaves.

Report 351(continued)

Royaltios from the song throughout the world, which have boon calculated at between $750,000 and 1,000,000, and although this amount will have to be divided among many things, something would fall to them.

Ruiz says to work abroad they have to or should send people of the greatest trust, otherwise it is bettert hat they remain in Cuba. If thoro isn't complete confidence it is a constant struggle with the capitalistic life, money, the stores, the easy life. They mention De la Nuoz, and Ruiz says if he's gone he's gone, but the interesting thing would bo to know what motivated him; his wife, his son, or money. He says that it has caused a great impression here, and that no one oven imagined such a thing. Only two days before he had been in the study circle with all of them.

A girl that is in this moeting with Ruiz says that De la Nuez' daughter is married to Juan Antonio GARCIA, who is Head of Government..., that he has been proposed for ambassador (Ruiz says that they will now have to reconsider this), and what they all three agree on is that De la Nuoz was not to blare,

Ruiz mentions the letter from De la Nuez' son in which he says that his father has betrayed them. They also mention an ambassador who has left(for Cuba-?) and took watches as gifts to everyone in the Ministry. Ruiz thinks that some of thom will remain here in Spain as they have a great deal going for them there.

Report No.352

26 June 1970

Ruiz' is very displeased. He speaks to Horacio about how badly some of the comrades speak of him when they return to Havana. He asks him if he rerembers the name of one of these comrades that spoke badly of him last summer when he was there on vaca- tion. It was someone named COLON and another one that soon left. After what COLON said they wrote him a letter calling his atten- tion to the criticism. Ruiz is very worried about his re-call to Havana. He tells Horacio that ho doesn't think it is about his work, and Horacio says they are doing things there that are super-human, that without the necessary means at hand they are resolving difficult problem of various kinds. Ruiz mentions contacts that he has had in Spain with different people, and he never has committed an error, and has always handled everything with great tact and in favor of his government, even when he has had to deal with Falangists.

Ruiz says that he is very sensitive and that things have got to the point that he can't just lot them go by, things they are accusing him of in Havana. But, there is no one that has the courage to tell him directly to his face so that he could Justify himself, and if they are things that he cannot handle then for them to call him back, and relieve him of the post because "Cort andante Guillermo Ruiz cannot resolve them, but the thing is


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

Report No.352(continued)
that the Minister doesn't want to receive him or listen to
him when he goes there. Horacio says that the worst of it
Is that here in Spain there is always some personality from there
that they have to o tertain, someone inmortent, and that the
attention they need is continual, and sometimes it is necess-
ary to attend to the people here in Spain, which prevents
thon from attending those who arrive from there, but they
don't understand this.

He continues to talk with Horacio and he is indignant. Ruis
days that ho has been in the Revolution since he was twenty
years old, when he began to think for himself. Ho says that
he belongs to no party, none other, that is, but the Cuban
communist party. He says that the situation is becoming so
uncomfortable rogarding him, and he doesn't like it at all..
He says he puts everything he has an all the care possible
into doing his job.

"Ruiz says that one never knows about these things in Havana,
and that it is possible that he won't be returning. In the
ovent that this should happen, he is going to leave Horacio
officially in charge, so that he will represent him during
his abscence.as Charge do Affairs, and if he roturns ho will
notify the Spanish government officially. He wants semoles
or models of the passports to take with him, and then he
tells Horacio that if he has not roturned by the 13th of
July, that he should reprosent him at the official recention.
Ho gives Horacio instructions as to what to wear, what the
official coremonies are and just what they consist
of.

Report No.354 30 June 1970
Ruiz speaks to someone that calls and gives him a rossage
which annoys Ruiz. Someone has called the Provincial Depart-
mont of ?blic Health of Santander saying that they (the Cubans)
use "boric acid" in the stoves(?) which they export. They
give him this message in the name of the Commercial Office of
Cuba, they have a Latin-american accent, and say that ther
would take adequate measures so that no stove would be shipped.

Ruiz says to Horacio that he doesn't have time to take care
of this matter, and for him to accompany Franco and go to the
General Department of Security and rake charges about the
telephone call which is interfering with the trade between
Cuba and Spain. He says to go right up as far as the Coneral
Director if necessary, not explaining the "boric acid" one way
or another, but simply as to the malicious call which was
made in the name of the Cormercial Office of Cuba. This can
cause a delay of six or eight days in the departure of a ship
while this call is being explained in Public Health.

TYPIC QUDOZE
Guillermo RUIZ Perez Recall to Havana

References: A. MADRID 1466
B. MADRID 1457

1. Relative to Subject's recall to Havana, which came via a telephone call on 24 June (probably from MINREX) bidding him and Orestes BARREDA Perez to return, QUDOZE has recorded Subject's reaction to the unexplained call as follows:

A. on 26 June Subject talked at length with Horacio FUENTES Martinez speculating on Havana's possible motives for requesting his return at this time, when in a matter of a few weeks he was scheduled to travel to Cuba for the 26 of July celebrations which he expected to combine with his vacation leave. He was extremely upset and complained bitterly about companeros who have tried to discredit him in Havana. He wondered if Havana was going to put him on the carpet for charges brought against him by these companeros. He recalled one COLON (he was not sure of the name) who last summer made false accusations against him, for which he received a letter of reprimand from Havana.

B. Subject also wondered if Havana could have any complaints about his work. He had always maintained good relations with the Spaniards and despite their contrary political idiology, he was careful not to ruffle their feathers while upholding his government's position at all times. He could not

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

Imagine that Havana would question him on that score. However, if there were problems that Havana felt he lacked the ability to resolve, he should simply be removed "because Comandanto Guillermo Ruiz cannot resolve them." Subject said he had been a revolutionary since the ago of 20 when he began to think for himself. He had never bolonged to any political party other than the Cuban Communist. The current state of affairs, however, was becoming too disturbing and distasteful to him because conscientiously he knew that he was putting forth his full mental and physical capacity toward the fulfillment of his function.

C. Subject told Fuentes that since he didn't know what was brewing in Havana it was possible that he might not return to Madrid. In any event he would designate Fuentes to substitute for him as charge d'affaires. During the entire conversation no mention was made of Orestes BARREDA Perez and why he was asked to return with RUIZ. The latter seemed to be thoroughly absorbed in his own concern over whatever fate lay in store for him on his return to Cuba.

22 June 1970

SUBJECT: Jules Chopin

At 2200 hrs on the evening of Saturday, 20 June, Jules Chopin entered the Embassy offices as instructed. His face showed the strain of the situation, yet he managed to force a grin. He was taken to a convenient office and for the next 2 ½ hours was debriefed. While sipping Scotch throughout the evening he managed to control some of his natural fears of the present and future.

In all fairness, he must be commended for answering our questions in a straightforward, sincere manner. While not every question--from the various interested parties--was put to him, the majority were. In some cases, he was given requirements for the next meeting, and in addition, he offered several worthwhile reports.

Apart from the business aspects of the meeting, there were two dominating themes running throughout: His passionate pleas for the personal safety of his family in the US and my stand that after his conduct on 12-13 February 1970, he had to prove his worth and good faith; not to me, but to the powers that be, who were highly distrustful of his intentions.

Specifically, the following matters were discussed:

1.  Asked if he knew what the DGI was, Chopin was confused, but understood when I said "DSE" or "G-2". In his circle, the intel people are known as "Seguridad del Estado" or "G-2". He denies that he has ever worked for them wittingly. He doubts that he has ever worked for them unwittingly, because he has never had more than a passing working relation with them. Chopin states that he has never known officially who the intel personnel are, "but after awhile, you can hear and see things that leave no doubt." Asked to identify those persons who he feels are intel and their hierarchy, Chopin stated:

    A.  In early 1969, Amando Lopez, appeared to be Chief of Intel and Diaz Vigo, the number two man.

    B.  When Orlando CASTRO defected in c. March 1969, LOPEZ was immediately recalled to Havana and has not been heard from since. DIAZ Vigo assumed head of intel, and Havana sent Emidio VALDES Martinez as a replacement. With VALDES, came his wife Magda (de los ESPOSA Viver) who went to work as DIAZ Vigo's secretary. Chopin considers her to be an intel agent as well.

    C.  In c. late February or early March 1970, Diaz Vigo was recalled

to Havana. He has not been heard from again and there is

h/w Call To CFPA 92830

talk that he will not return.

Page 2

D. Fegar has taken over the control of the Consular Section and appears to be directing the functions that DIAZ Vigo had. No one has been appointed to take DIAZ Vigo's post.

E. The only other prominent suspect of being a full fledged intel type is *Hildo ALVAREZ Veldes*, who came to Paris about 2 years ago with the cover position of chauffeur. ALVAREZ's true role was made evident shortly after he arrived in Paris when an unwitting functionary of the Cuban Embassy gave ALVAREZ a routine chauffeur's assignment. Whereupon ALVAREZ turned to the individual and said, "I didn't come here to be a chauffeur." ALVAREZ has never functioned prominently as a chauffeur, and they had to change his status after a while, because he couldn't fool anyone in that role.

F. Chopin denies that he knows anything of their manner of operations; who their contacts or agents are; and, in a word, the inner workings of the intel apparatus.

G. Chopin acknowledges that many Latin Americans visit the Embassy, "but they go upstairs to the Consulate," and he does not know their identities, nor the exact purpose of their visits. His lone contact with Latin American types are when they enter his section asking for propaganda material. In those cases, Chopin directs them to help themselves from the racks of Cuban publications available.

Guillermo RUIZ Perez (201-735296) and Danilo MENDEZ Fernandez (201-788424)

1. At Christmas 1969, after turning down other invitations, AMARTINI-1 and his wife accepted an invitation to dinner at the home of Guillermo RUIZ Perez (201-735296) and his wife Nilda. Another couple was present, Danilo MENDEZ Fernandez (201-788424) and his wife Lydia. Ruiz impressed the AMARTINI couple as intelligent and *muy fino*. He talked very favorably of the U.S., especially New York City for which he had great admiration. "Americans are very bad", he said, "but they have very good things." "Jose, let's go to New York", he said at one point, causing MENDEZ, a good revolutionary, some discomfort. He never had trouble in the five years he spent in the States, Ruiz said at another point in the conversation.

2. Mendez is a "great apple polisher", according to the AMARTINI couple, and he was hard put to know what to say when the "Ambassador", his boss (indirectly) spoke so favorably of the U.S. AMMARTINI-1's wife, on the other hand, said that Lydia Mendez was having a somewhat similar problem with Nilda Ruiz. The latter was expecting again at the time and after five boys, Lydia suggested that she (Nilda) probably wished for a girl. "Not at all", said Nilda. "I don't want a daughter of mine to go into agricultural work at fourteen years of age", she exclaimed setting Lydia back. AMMARTINI-1 pointed out that the Ruiz couple has a 14 year-old son in Cuba -- a "hostage" while they are abroad. They might be willing to defect, according to AMARTINI-1, if it weren't for leaving the boy in Cuba.

Report No.344 1 June 1970

Ruiz dictates to. Nilda: "The Cuban Embassy greets, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs and has the pleasure to request the corres-
ponding permission to carry a pistol, "Star" 9 m.m.short, No.50.
234, wich at the present time is being held in the offices
of the "Star" factory, in the Plaza de España, for
_, whose photograph is attached."

Ruiz is talking with a Cuban who is in Madrid on a scholarship.

They are talking of bringing a teacher from Cuba and Ruiz
says that this would be very difficult. He says that instruction
is given by professors, but education is given by the parents,
and what the children will be demends on this education.
Ruiz says that his father made him a communist. Of all the
children, he was the only one that studied, but it was his
father that formed them all. From the time he was a sma11
child his father gave him books of Lenin to read. These books
arrived clandestinely to Cuba. He remarks about problems his
own children have given him. He refers to an incident where
one of the children was invited to a First Cormunton, and
speaks of the freedom he gave the child to make his First
Cormunion also, if he wanted to.

Then Ruiz says that his other son "ALEJANDRO, is inclined to
remain in Spain, and he is willing to let him if this is what
the boy wants. He says that these things have to come from
one's own self, and if they are opposed in these actions it
can leave marks on them for the rest of their lives. Ruiz
says he gives them the liberty to choose.

Ruiz tolk this student with whom he is conversing that Alejan-
dro DE LA INEZ has gone to the United States, and adds that
De La Nuez wife never came to meetings or reunions that
were held at the embassy. She always gavo as an excuse that
her nerves were bad. Ruiz says that De La Nuez took the money
with him.

This comrade (F) left at 12:15. He said goodbye to her very
cordialiy. Apparently around the 29th of the month she is
going to Paris.

Later Ruiz entered the office again and put the radio on very
loud. He didn't leave the office all morning, but the radio
continued to play very loud; so much so that you can hardly
tell when anyone goes in or out of the of ice.

Report 345 18 June 1970

Apparently they have received a document in which all the Chiefs
of Mission have been called to Cuba for the third week of July,
as some of them can make it coincide with their leave. He tells
Curbelo that he intends to send Nilda either before or after he
leaves.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 85

Report No.345(continued) 18 June 1970

Ruiz and Nilda are alone and are talkin: about when they can leave Spain. Ruiz wants here to go on Theria, but Milda says she doesn't want to go seperately. If he goes on Cubana she will go with him. Hilda speaks of the 18th of July fiesta, and says that the Minister has been so nice to him that he shouldn't miss this Spanish holiday. They then discuss leaving for Havana on the 20th or 21st of July.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 86

# Report No.345

18 June 1970

Nilda speaks to Ruiz about someone that spoke to her that wants to stay in Madrid for a few days, but they don't have any money, (Possibly it is ALPARA) and they have asked her if they can stay at her house. It seems that the people she is talking about are on their way to Cuba, and they say, if they don't have the money to stay in Madrid, then let them go directly to Cuba. Nilda says that CHAIN's son-in-law is going to Morocco as Cuban ambassador. The one that he had as his secretary. When Alfara was in Madrid he said that the son-in-law had neither the personality nor the qualifications for the position. Ruiz says that if they are referring to the head of Chain's office, that he is going to Poland as ambassador, but Nilda insists that it is the husband of Chain's daughter..

Two comrades arrive, a man and a woman. They are going to Holland, where they will spend a week, and they want a visa. They will go to other European countries also, and will be a month and a half al together. (It seems that it is only the woman that is going to Holland and the other countries). Ruiz asks her if it is her first trip to Purope. She says it is her first trip to Western Europe, but that she has already been in the socialist countries of Europe. Ruiz asks them what Havana thought about De la Nuez. Ruiz says it isn't worth having an argument or quarrel with the "gallero" because of De la Nuez. Ruiz believes that the whole affair was handled by "he C.Ι. Α.

Ruiz asks them who has been named ambassador to Morocco, and they confirm the fact that the husband of his daughter (CHAIN-?) has been appointed.

They return to the top of De la Nuez. Ruiz says the only thing they know is that he has gone, but they don't know where. In any case, most likely they had family or friends among the refugees in Mami

Ruiz asks the girl if there are new people in the Ministry there (Havana-?), if new ones are coming in. She says that her enterprise has 71 employees, and that 55 of them are outside of the enterprise, that the personnel situation is very bad. Two days ago they started giving language classes in French and German, and they talked with RAUL and he believes it is very necessary, because it is very difficult to find people. In addition to their being of trust, what is difficult is their lack of culture.

Again they discuss De la Nuez' case and his wife. They tell Ruiz not to be too discouraged because it is the first time that anything; like this happened to him here. Ruiz tells them about the illness of the woman, and that she never wanted to come to the meetings, but on the other hand went to meetings and gatherings of commercial people and others. He was never suspicious of him. Two days before he had been in the study Center with all of them. Ruiz says that it had been six months since they


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 87

Report No.345(continued)
proposed petting; a substitute for De La Nuez, but only because
of his administrative inefficiency, and for no other reason.
If Ruiz had suspected anything he would have put him on a
plane and sent him back there.

A person from the Feria in Barcelona comes into the office.
He has some business to do with Horacio here in Madrid.
They hope that Raul LEON will arrive on Thursday, as they
have many things to wor!: out together regarding the
Chamber of Commerce in Madrid. He speaks about "Cubaexport"
Jand a problem that they have with the brand name. He says it
would be better to postpone the process and continue exporting
meanwhilo to the Canary Islands, until it is all settled.
He has visited. The Chamber of Commerce in Barcelona. He has
Jeaten and had supper with some of the people from there. He
mentions GUERRERO y Garabon, to whom he and ROVIRA have given
an explanation: First, the problem that exists with the Can
Chamber of Commerce can be resolved by a simple diploma ic
gesture, Second, the Individual that has an interest in it,it is
up to him Third, the problem can be solved by establishing
another Chamber of Commerce in Madrid. This however, would
involve spending and would not be worth it to them economically.

ROVIRA told him that he wanted to go to California. He wants to
be close to Cuba and learn the future development of the
Cuban production.

Nilda says that they have received a call from Paris telling
them that VAIDES VIVO left there and will arrive in Madrid at
2:45 PM. Ruiz asks if they sent the cable to Moscow. Nilda
says that they have, but that no one answered the cable. They
have received only one cable from Moscow saring that he was
coming. Then they sont another cable back askin on what
Flight, and on what day, but they have had no answer.

Report No.346
Two people enter Ruiz' office. One of them is called "PORRILIA"(ph).
They are discussing: De La Nuez. Zorrilla says he has been very
hurt by it all, not only politically, but personally also. He
says that he always felt that De La Nuez was a person one could
trust, and that he has failed them. Ruiz says that hero everyone
trusted him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 88

-5-

Report No.316(continued)
They continue to talk about De La Nuez, particularly the visitors. Ruiz says that after this they are going to have to strengthen the cadros, that it is important for everyone. He says he has spokon to. MAINEIL CASTROSATA (phon), and they have agreed to form new very strict--cadres.-

The visitors leave and on saying goodbye Ruiz says not to discuss the De La Nuez affair too much so that it won't spread any further. Besides, they are all very impressed by it.

VALDES VIVO CALIS RUTZ on the telephone. Ruiz asks him if he has arrived at the hotel and if he has seen MARISI (phon). (MARISI is staying at the same hotel as Valdes). Ruiz says that Zorrilla has just been there, and he has given him the telephone number of the hotel for him to call. He says they have had no word on the Cubana flight, only that it is to arrive today and will leave tonight. But, Ruiz says if it arrives at 3 o'clock that this will not give them time to inspect it and all to leave, even though they will do it all at night. Both Valdes and Marisi are leaving this evening on Cubana.

Ruiz then speaks with Marisi, and says that he had heard of his appointmont as ambassador. Apparently this is the one that is to be in Morocco. They say that this ambassador, in all the capitals that he is going; to, is visited by the best doctors. Ruiz tells them that he has a luncheon onpagement but that he will keep in touch rogarding the flight.

Report No.34.8
Tho ambassador that has just arrived from Beirut onter the office. He was at the movies last nicht and they comment on it. Then two other persons come in, one of them is Zorrilla. They speak of various things; that by diplomatic mail they should only send things of a confidential nature, everything else should go by diplomatic pouch.

MERCEDES enters and sars that Corrade Armando VELAZOUZ, whom Ruiz does not know, is here. He is the father of the Cuban consul in Janaica. He says he has been here 15 days waiting for something to be resolved. He adds that a Rosa Maria of the Ministry was supposed to resolve this problem, but she hasn't done so. He doesn't want to borrow money here, and BARREDA has already given him 1000 pesetas. Ho wants then to send a cable to Havana to resolve his situation. Mercedes says that this consul studied in the University with Barreda and that he is a very ine person.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 89

Report No. 348 (continued)

They tell Ruiz that the person that is here is ALARCON; he hasn't seen him, nor has he received any cable about his arrival.

Then the ambassador asks Ruiz if they carry pistols here. Ruiz shows him one with five chambers, with which he can shoot without taking it out of his-pocket. He says they won't kidnap him, and that one has to be prepared for there are 10,000 rusaros here.

Ruiz tells the ambassador to consult with ROA and tell him that he has received a cable telling him to be in Havana the second week of July, but that the National Day in Spain is on the 18th. He says that he doesn't want to miss this celebration, because the Minister of Foreign Affairs came to their fiesta, and he would have to explain about the reunion in Havana and all that, and they could think something else. So that he is thinking of staying even if he has to leave the very next day on the 19th.

Report No. 349

Some comrades arrive. It appears to be the Alfaras. Mercedes calls Iberia and confirms reservations for the afternoon flight to Havana, 941, in the names of Carlos Alfara and Berta Fernandez. She asks what time they should be in the airport in order to leave on the six o'clock flight. They tell her they should be there an hour before flight time.

Ruiz begins to dictate the following to Nilda, in a very low voice: "To enlarge further on the report dated 7 of the current month regarding my meeting with the Minister of Labor, Sr.LICINIO DE LA FUENTE, in relation to the request of theNational Institute of Fishing and the Ministry of Basic Industries for contracting Spanish technicians, we wish to inform you that today we received a telephone call from the Executive Officer to the Ministry of Labor. He informed us that cur request for Spanish technicians is still being considered, but that the Minister of Labor and the Spanish government wishes to communicate official-ly to my Government, their official displeasure with the position adopted by the Cuban representation in the last meeting of the 0.I.T. (I.L.O.) regarding a proposition that interferes in the internal affairs of Spain. Unfortunately the Minister of Labor had confirmed, the request of our representative in Geneva contradicted the efforts that were being made at high levels of our countries for the betterment of our relations, and the cooperation, and for the brotherhood, that should exist between two peoples of the same blood."

My total lack of knowledge of wat took place in the I.L.O. with regard to Spain, and the position takon by our delegation, precludes e from answering with accuracy, limiting myself only, to saying that I would pass on the words of the Minister and that an explanation of the problem would be given.

Report No.349 (continued)
On the other hand, on this same date I received word from our Consul in Barcelona advising that he has observed a minimum of interost in the industrial circles with which we trade. This would make it appear that a problem exists at a high level between the Government of Cuba and the Government of Spain, which is holding back trade with our country. Specifically, some industrialists have advised our representative that the Ministry of Commerce has spread the word that until certain talks are held between the two governments authorization of permission of import with estination Cuba have been suspended.

We are attempting to confirm this today and learn if there exists some relation with what we have been advised by the Ministry of Labor.

We would appreciate it greatly if you would, as soon as possible, inform us what the position of our Covernment was in the meeting of the I.L.O. in Geneva.

Dear ROA: I beg you to see that this confidential (note/gets to our President, to the Minister of Basic Industries and to the President of the Fishing Institute.

Ruiz tells Horacio that ho should tell MARIÑAS that "we are willing to chanzo our passports, and to give us blank models of both the diplomatic and regular passports in order to study them and compare them with those used by other countries.

Report No. 350 21 June 1970.

Ruiz asks PACHECO if they have reserved tickets for him and BARREDA, who have been called from Havana by telephone. The tickets are to be reserved for the two of them only, not for the wives, neither Mercedes nor Nilda.

Ruiz says that NEIRA is to arrive today on his way to Paris, and they will see what he has to say about this (the call from Havana) They don't know if the call from Havana is for the abassadors meeting which will be held now, or only for the two of them to discuss something related to Spain. Pacheco says that that is maybe why the ambassador of Helsinki asked for reservations yesterday.

Ruiz continues to talk with the new person that has arrived. He says that he has had to go to the Hotel Conde Duque to visit the crew of Cubana, who have never once come to the embassy, although sometimes some of them are here for a week: they don't attend the study circles, the meetings, nor anything. They havee complained about Ruiz because sometimes they have learned of receptions that have taken place and they haven't been invited. Ruiz.says that if at these receptions they invited industrial and commercial people, or even cultural people, they would get nothing done here. When they give a reception it is because of work, to maintain contacts, find things out, and not for any other purpose. They have nothing to do there, and he is not going to invite them to just come and eat and drink When they have to spend some pesetas they do it, but for questions of work. Nevertheless they have the obligation to maintain contacts. Ruiz has sometimes met these people on the street, especially the air-stewardesses, with some "pick-up", and although all the people they are friendly with are very nice people, they should know who these people are.

Ruiz then explains to this new comrade the problem of the location of the embassy. He telb him that they are building a now embassy and all the services will be together. There will also be come community rooms, such as a library, a recreation rcom, a dining room with a bar, that they will all have a chance to see, but this is going to take probably a year. It will be on Avonida de la Havana. Meanwhile they are putting up with this place because they only pay $50.00 for it, and Havana finds its a gift. If they were paying $500, by now they woul in't be here; they would have found some other place. They have the place rented since 1936, and even though they have spent more than a thousand (or one hundred thousand) in fixing it, it is still an old house.

With this new arrival he talks about the children, and the problems they have with the schools. They have to find schools where they don't teach religion nor politics.

Report No.350 (continued).

21 June 1970.

It seems that they would like to bring a professor from Hamana, so that the children could study the same revolutionary rethods as there, but Ruiz sees this as a very difficult thing to do. Because, one would not solve the situation of the different grades and ages, and they are not going to send four or five because they are needed there. He sees it as a better possibility to hire Spanish profössers among the young capable people, with révolutionary leanings and who are simpathetic toward Cubans, and have them teach the methods, and from books that are brought from there. In this way they could have many professors or teachers for the various ares, and they could rent and furnish an apartment for this purpose.

Apparently Buiz has no problems with the school his children attend. The Director of the school is a friend of theirs and wisits the embassy. Her husband is a communist. The children that attend the school have the same political leanings as their parents. Noither religion nor politics are taught. Ruiz says that the two older ones eat at the school, but the little ones don't as they need help. Ruiz pays over $100 for L. The person who is with him has two children and pays 100 for the two.

The children of this new comrade that is talking to Ruiz arrive day after tomorrow. He has a little girl ll years old and the other one is nine. Ruiz is advising the commade to send hi children to the same school where his children go. The name of the school is "ESPINO" or "EL PINO", in the Calle Serrano. He says he will be glad to speak to the Director. They have sports, and music, and the children can have lunch at the school.

Report No.351

25 June 1970

He is talking with Mercedes, and they enter the office and continue the conversation. They are speaking in confidential voices, because Mercedes normally talks very loud, they are now talking in very low voices. Mercedes is trying to consale him, saying that his work is very difficult and little understood. Ruiz says that they are"throwing him the bait."

He is very dopressed.

Tomorrow he has an appointment with Quiroga publishing comnany, who have had a meeting with DAVID PAX(phon) about the rights of the sons: "Guantanamera.", which was acknowledred in London by an American firm, and it's author as being the Cuban Jose FERNANDEZ Diaz, at a reunion that was held there. In the United States alone there are rights (or royalties) of over $50,000. They are trying to establish definite authorship for this Cuban, so that he will be able to collect some of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

Report 351 (continued)
royalties from the song throughout the world, which have been calculated at between $750,000 and $1,000,000, and although this amount will have to be divided among many things, something would fall to them.

Ruiz says to work abroad they have to or should send people of the greatest trust, otherwise it is better that they remain in Cuba. If there isn't complete confidence it is a constant struggle with the capitalistic life, money, the stores, the easy life. They mention De la Nuez, and Ruiz says if he's gone he's gone, but the interesting thing would be to know what motivated him; his wife, his son, or money. He says that it has caused a great impression here, and that no one even imagined such a thing. Only two days before he had been in the study circle with all of them.

A girl that is in this meeting with Ruiz says that De la Nuez' daughter is married to Juan Antonio GARCIA, who is Head of Government..., that he has been proposed for ambassador (Ruiz says that they will now have to reconsider this), and what they all three agree on is that De la Nuez was not to blame,

Ruiz mentions the letter from De la Nuez' son in which ho says that his father has betrayed them. They also mention an ambassador who has left (for Cuba-?) and took watches as gifts to everyone in the Ministry. Ruiz thinks that some of them will remain here in Spain as they have a great deal going for them there.

Report No.352 26 June 1970

Ruiz' is very displeased. He speaks to Horacio about how badly some of the comrades speak of him when they return to Havana, He asks him if he remembers the name of one of these comrades that spoke badly of him last summer when he was there on vaca- tion. It was someone named COLON and another one that soon left. After what COLON said they wrote him a letter calling his atten- tion to the criticism. Ruiz is very worried about his re-call to Havana. He tells Horacio that he doesn't think it is about his work, and Horacio says they are doing things there that are super-human, that without the necessary means at hand they are resolving difficult problem of various kinds. Ruiz mentions contacts that he has had in Spain with different people, and he never has committed an error, and has always handled everything with great tact and in favor of his government, even when he has had to deal with Falangists.

Ruiz says that ho is very sensitive and that things have got to the point that he can't just let them go by, things they are accusing him of in Havana. But, there is no one that has the courage to tell him directly to his face so that he could Justify himself, and if they are things that he cannot handle then for them to call him back, and relieve him of the post because "Corr andante Guillermo Ruiz cannot resolve them, but the thing is


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 94

-11-

Report No.352(continued)
that the Minister doesn't want to receive him or listen to
him when he goes there. Horacio says that the worst of it
is that here in Spain there is always some personality from there
that they have to entertain, someone important, and that the
attention they-need-is continual, and sometimes it is necess-
ary to attend to the people here in Spain, which prevents
them from attending those who arrive from there, but they
don't understand this.

He continues to talk with Horacio and he is indignant. Ruiz
says that he has been in the Revolution since he was twenty
years old, when he began to think for himself. He says that
he belongs to no party, none other, that is, but the Cuban
communist party. He says that the situation is becoming so
uncomfortable regarding him, and he doesn't like it at all.
He says he puts everything he has anfall the care possible
into doing his job.

Ruiz says that one never knows about these things in Havana,
and that it is possible that he won't be returning. In the
event that this should happen, he is going to leave Heracio
officially in charge, so that he will represent him during
his abscence.as Charge'de Affairs, and if he returns he will
notify the Spanish government officially. He wants sammles
or models of the passports to take with him, and then he
tells Horacio that if he has not returned by the 18t!! of
July, that he should represent him at the official reception.
He gives Horacio instructions as to what to wear, what the
official ceremonies are and just what they consist of.

Report No.354 30 June 1970
Ruiz speaks to someone that calls and gives him a message
which annoys Ruiz. Someone has called the Provincial Depart-
ment of Public Health of Santander saying that they (the Cubans)
изо "boric acid" in the stoves(?) which they export. They
give him this message in the name of the Commercial Office of
Cuba, they have a Latin-Amert an accent, and say that ther
would take adequate measures so that no stove would be shipped.

Ruiz says to Horacio that he doesn't have time to take care
of this matter, and for him to accompany Franco and go to the
General Department of Security and make charges about the
telephone call which is interfering with the trade between
Cuba and Spain. He says to go right up as far as the General
Director if necessary, not explaining the "boric acid" one way
or another, but simply as to the malicious call which was
made in the name of the Commercial Office of Cuba. This can
cause a delay of six or eight days in the departure of a ship
while this call is being explained in Public Health.

TO: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
INFO: Chief, European Division
Chief of Station, WH/Miami: COS, Lisbon

FROM: Chief of Station, Madrid

SUBJECT: TYPIC QUTIMID
Aida Rosa CORREA Felipe de ECHEVARRIA

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

Reference: MADRID 1230

1.  QUTIMID periodically has reported contact between Subject and Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the Cuban Minister in Madrid, mostly over the telephone but also indicating that he has seen her personally. It would appear that he has taken unusually strong interest in her, consibring the number of other more demanding tasks he claims to have. Until now, we have not been able to identify either Subject or her relationship with RUIZ.

2.  On 28 May QUDOZE (a sensitive joint audio penetration with liaison) reported the following memorandum (presumably to Havana) on Subject as dictated by RUIZ:

"Sr. RUIZ Ojeda. Some months ago we received a ciphered cable dealing with Aida Rosa CORREA Felipe asking that we contact her to determine her situation. At that time we informed you that said Aida Rosa CORREA, married to Pedro ECHEVARRIA , Portuguese citizen who was in Cuba during 1959-1968, intended to return to our country, abandoning her husband because of his alcoholism."

"Approximately one week ago the brother of Aida Rosa CORREA Luis CORREA Felipe passed through Madrid en route to France on a special mission. He spoke with her at the Airport about definitely returning in order to see that her 12-year-old son might be educated in Cuba."

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH S=E-C-R-ET- OSMA-26265

Today we interviewed Aida Rosa CORREA and her son, who at all times has maintained a positive attitude toward this Embassy concerning her return. We have let her know that given the circumstances of her presence in Spain - not as a 'gusano' but as the wife of a foreign doctor who has worked in our country - we saw no difficulty to prevent her from returning, especially taking into account the fact that she expresséd herself as a revolutionary, but that first we had to receive official permission.

"In our opinion, because the situation in which she finds herself in Spain because of marriage to a foreimer, her return can be authorized, based on what has expired."

It has been reported that he had been working at the Ministry of Treasury since prior to 1959, that is, under the Batista regime. So far, we have not been able to confirm this information.

Political affiliations and attitude: It has been reported that subject is a member of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) and a staunch sympathizer of the Cuban regimo. There is information to the effect that in 1958, Subject was in exile in Mexico and was a member of the Triple A Organization led by Dr. Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango. It has also been reported that during the struggle against BATISTA (1957-1958), Subject belonged to action and sabotage groups in Havana and was charged with placing bombs and other devices. Source does not know exactly what activities Subject carried out as a member of action and sabotage groups, but believes that he had to leave for Mexico in 1958 on account of his activities.

Intelligence connections: RUIZ has been reported as a member of the General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI). It has been reported that in 1961 and 1962 he was a G-2 (NSE) member at the Ministry of Treasury, where he worked.

Travels: He traveled to Mexico (from mid-1963 until mid-1964, he was Cuban Commercial Counsellor in Mexico). Spain, where he has been since late 1967 as Cuban Charge de affaires. (It was reported that on 27 July 1968, he arrived in Paris, from Madrid. We do not know the reasons for that trip).

Access:

a. Rolando CARDOSO Perez (A18.239 674). Arrived in the U.S. on 10 October 1968 from Madrid, Spain. He knows Subject because he and Subject are cousins (Subject's mother and Rolando's mother are sisters). When Rolando arrived in the U.S., he said he was going to reside at 940 SW 11th Avenue, Miami, Florida, telephone number 377-3077. We have not been able to locate him because we were told at this address that Rolando had left for another state and that his present address was unknown to them). Rolando saw Subject for the last time at the Barajas Airport, Madrid, Spain, on 10 October 1968, when Rolando was going to take the plane which brought him to the U.S. According to Rolando, they greeted each other on that occasion. Rolando said he had seen Subject at this same airport in early or mid-1968 and that they had talked for approximately five minutes. On this opportunity, Subject was at the airport waiting for the arrival of a group of Cuban diplomats.

b. Manuel Domingo German VIGOS Perez (A18 780 716). Arrived in the U.S. on 20 February 1970 by way of the Refugee Airlift. He knows Subject because he and Subject are cousins (Subject's mother and Manuel's mother are sisters). Manuel saw Subject for the last time in 1963, at the home of Subject's mother, where they happened to meet. According to Manuel, he and Subject only said hello to each other. When Manuel arrived

in the U.S., he reported his address as 4000 NW Fourth Street, Miami, Florida, telephone number 445-7193, home of a lady named Mercedes BORGES Dobarros. Manuel also stated that he would later leave for 433 Wast 49th Street, New York, N.Y., homo of Antonio GOMEZ Lemus. Manuel told I-122 that he and his friend, Jorge BORGES Dobarros, were homosexuals and had beơn living together since approximately 1963. (Jorge BORGES Dobarros ar- rived in Miami aboard the same Refugee Airlift flight as Manuel. He is a brother of Mercedes BORGES Dobarros, and he and Manuel went to live in Mercedes' house when they arrived in Miami).

We believe that Manuel cannot be used in an approach to Subject because they have not maintained relations for a long period of years. In addition, Subject might know Manuel saakness (homosexualism) and might take advantage of this knowledge to blackmail Manuel. Manuel also told I-122 that he had received psychiatric treatment in Havana.

Assessment:

Subject's present position; the positions, all of them important, which he has held before; and the fact that he has been reported as a DGI officer, lead us to be- lieve that we do not have many possibilities of success in an attempt to recruit or defect Subject. The fact that Subject's father has been a militant Communist since prior to 1959 and that Subject's wife has been reported as a supporter of the regime should not be forgotten.

Subject's revolutionary background during the struggle against BATISTA seems to indicate that he is in favor of acts of terrorism. This gave him knowledge and ex- perience in matters related to subversive activities and/or intelligence activities which he could use later.

Therefore, we believe that Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Pe- rez must be a very useful person for the Cuban regime, in Spain. He has experience in negotiating trade agree- ments and in handling administrative affairs (he has beon working in this field for more than ten years). All this knowledge and experience added to his know- ledge and experience in subversive and intelligence affairs make him a man who is not often found in the Castro regime.

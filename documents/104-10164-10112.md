Clémard Joseph CHARLES
President and General Manager
of the Commercial Bank of Haiti

![CENTRAL REFERENCE SERVICE, INTELLIGENCE AGENCY seal]

Clémard Joseph Charles, a man who has insisted on numerous occasions that he will be the next President of Haiti, has been chronically involved, directly or indirectly, in rumored plots against President Duvalier which have never materialized. In May 1963 Charles is reported to have passed word to US officials through an American journalist that he was in a position to head a provisional government after President Duvalier had been removed from power. In subsequent years, particularly in 1966 and 1967, Charles approached US officials both in New York and Port-au-Prince with the apparent intention of enlisting US support for a group of conspirators he claimed to lead which was determined to topple Duvalier from power. None of these plots materialized, however, and there was never any evidence to suggest that any serious plans had been made.

In January 1969 Charles had a lengthy conversation with an official of the US Embassy in which the former candidl discussed his grievances against Duvalier and the plot he claimed to be instigating to overthrow Duvalier and replace him as President of Haiti. Charles stated that the group supporting his efforts consisted primarily of soldiers, a few militiamen, some professional men, priests, students, and assorted other well-placed individuals. He claimed that representatives of these groups had already agreed on the essential elements of a constitution which would include a bicameral legislature and an operative political party structure. The reporting official cautioned, however, that Charles' remarks should be viewed in light of his previous history of relating such conspiracies..

When President Duvalier was reported to be seriously 111 in mid-May 1969, Charles' neme was again mentioned in connection with myriad rumors of imminent government take-ware. According to a reliable source, a military junta was formed to take power in the event of the death of Duvalier. The junta purportedly included Gen. Gérard Constant, Col. Octave Cayard, Col. Kusner Blain, Col. Roger St. Albin, and Col. René Prosper. Charles was said

to be aware of the identities of these men. Furthermore, according to an official of the US Embassy, at one time it appeared that Charles had originated the idea of the junta, hoping to utilize it eventually to launch his own candidacy for the Presidency. Subsequently, however, Charles changed his statements about being "the next President" to being "a future President," and he seemed to be placing some distance between himself and the proposed junta.

During Charles' aforementioned conversation with an Embassy official in January 1969, he revealed other facets of his personality as well as his penchant for plotting. He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost messianic terms. He said that he had invested $2 million in Haiti and had done more for the development of the country than any other indigenous Haitian. He claimed, for example, that the workers in the Artibonite were passionate admirers of his because his tannery in Port Sondé (now closed) provided needed jobs. He also claimed the special allegiance of the chauffeur guides, the only truly organized workers in the country, because when he directed the compulsory Government Motor Vehicle Insurance program, legitimate chauffeur claims were paid. He implied that such claims were no longer honored.

Discussing the internal problems of his country, Charles stressed the need for immediate steps to prevent the total destruction of Haiti's land and resources, to control the spiraling population growth, and to rejuvenate the country's secondary cities. To achieve these goals before current trends become irreversible, Charles believes that it is essential to pursue relations with the United States that would be conducive to massive assistance: and investment. In this respect he insists that Duvalier has been grossly unrealistic and has done Haiti great damage by his refusal to recognize the role the United States must play in Haitian affairs.

SOURCE US citizen; independent businessman who has visited in Haiti for extended periods during the past four years. He is currently attempting to promote private financial backing for installation of generating equipment at the Barrage de Peligre dam and for educational television in Haiti.

[This report was developed and prepared by a US Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. I recently spent approximately three days in Haiti (9-12 Dec 68) and while there had extended visits with Clemard Joseph Charles, President, Banque Commerciale d'Haiti, and also owner of a sisal plantation and will. Present during my visits with Charles was his personal assistant and con- fidant, Ludovich Celestines. Charles, a devout Catholic, personally told me that he intended to attempt to overthrow Duvalier. He has made specific plans for this overthrow in late February or early March 1969. He claims that he definitely has the Army and the Catholic Church with him, and that the overthrow will be without bloodshed.

2. I had not intended to contact other officials or individuals in Haiti. However, on the last day of my stay I was invited to visit with Clovis M. Desinor, formerly Haiti's representative to the UN and currently Dr. Duvalier's Minister of Finance. He is said to be the No. 2 man in Haiti - next to Duvalier. Present at the meeting with Desinor was his assistant, Dr. Herve Boyer and reportedly the No. 3 man.

BACKGROUND

3. I first met the individuals mentioned above in 1965-66 while on an extended stay in Haiti for business purposes. I was introduced to Charles by Max Rowe, a driver assigned to me by the Haitian Government and whose wife, Raymonde, was the personal secretary for Charles. Rowe continued to drive for me on that first and subsequent visits to Haiti except on this latest visit when he was absent in the US.

4. When I first met Charles he was President of the Banque Commerciale d'Haiti, owned the Sisal plantation and mill, also owned a tannery financed by West German interests, and was the President of the limiti se Chamber of Commerce and Haitian correspondent for the First National City Bank of New York. During the period approximately one year prior to June 1967, Charles put into effect a system of Social Security (Office of National Assurance) which was working well and liked by the Haitian

people. He also devised an automobile insurance system and was financing this through the Banque Commerciale d'Haiti.

5. In a period just prior to June 1967 Duvalier was convinced by Desinor and Boyer that Charles was, or at least had been, plotting Duvaliers' overthrow. Together with a large group Charles was imprisoned in Port-au-Frinde from June 1967 to June 1968.

6. Just prior to the arrest of Charles, Max Rowe's wife, Raymonde, took US$200,000 out of the bank and hid it near Cap Haitien in the north and advised Charles' wife of the location. In addition, Max Rove claims that in June 1967 he and his wife (Raymonde Rowe is in process of getting US citizenship. Max is in the US on a visitor's permit) brought papers incriminating Charles to the US and destroyed them.

BANK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION

7. Although Charles has the bank, his position at present is difficult. I saw the bank balance sheet which shows assets of US$2.9 million but only US$29,000 (as of 10 Dec 68) cash on hand. With this small amount of cach he can no longer make loans. He says that he has found it necessary to make sizeable loans to Haitians who have in turn made highly speculative loans to others at exorbitant rates of interest. Very minor amounts of these loans have been repaid to the bank and thus his current financial position.

8. Charles is hopeful that when Duvalier's overthrow has been completed he will be able to get private financial assistance from the US. According to Charles, US financial organizations have almost completely stopped their assistance because of the oppressive Duvalier Government.

9. Charles says that Max Rowe is aware of his plans to overthrow Duvalier: which were communicated to Rowe by a La Bonte Jean, who is also in the US. Charles says that the Army is unhappy with Duvalier because of the execution of fourteen officers after the abortive May 1968 invasion, which included Major Toma, who was popular and powerful in his position as a censor and in control of all foreigners coming into Haiti. Charles maintains that the Ton Ton Macoutes are no longer a potent force - not operational. They have no food and are receiving no pay.

10. John Pierre La Grand, UK Consul General in Haiti and Shell Oil General Manager, agrees with Charles that Desinor and Boyer are Duvalier's closest confidants. Fito Metales (alias Fritz Belmont) is said by Rowe and La Grand to be Duvalier's hatchet man. Ee is manager of the Croupiera at the Royal Cabaret. La Grand says that the "old man", (Duvalier) is stronger than ever, both in health and power.

   ment as head of the BCH. Charles has also promised, as part
   of the price of reinstatement, to pay an additiona). US$400
   thousand. This total of US$600 thousand closely approximatas
   the US$605 thousand cited earlier as the "ransom" for Charles'
   release from prison. I understand that the US$200 thousand
   has already been paid. Whare Charles got this sun. I do not

   enabling Charles to raise the required US$400 thousand and also
   possibly attracting foreign investment capital to Haiti) out-
   weigh the benefits of refusing his permission to operate until

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Domestic Contact Service

ATTENTION: Mr. George S. Musulin

SUBJECT: DCS Case 47540 - Contact
with Louis A. Brun

1. Reference is made to our memorandum of 12 April 1966 and subsequent communications on the subject of WH/7 interest in the contact which had been established by DCS representatives in New York with Louis A. Brun. This contact served to monitor the activities of Chamard Joseph Charles, the Haitian banker, who was plotting to overthrow the Duvalier regime in Haiti.

2. In June 1967, Charles was arrested in Port-au-Prince and has spent the majority of the time since then in jail. He is released at various intervals by Duvalier apparently to give him the opportunity to locate more money for the regime. Since Charles fell from grace, it has become apparent that any hopes or plans he may have had to overthrow Duvalier have long since past. Accordingly, we wish to advise that WH/7 has no special interest in DCS maintaining contact with Brun to cover Charles' activities. Likewise, we do not feel that there are any special requirements at this time which Brun could service regarding Haitian matters.

    already used the system. The letter in Reference "A" vas the

2.  Reference "D" stated that the letter had been dispatched
    via Message Center Courier to the State Fepartment on 24 June
1968. 
3.  On or about 21 June 1968 Brun telephoned us and stated
    thos Charles had not received the letter. We telephoned Mr.
    Musulin, who double-checked and assured us that the letter bad
    gone to the State Department and that it should go out in the
    asxt youch.

4.  On 10 July 1968, Brum telephoned us and stated that
    en 9 July 1968 he had rweet.ed a telephone call from a Bay

5. On 11 July 1968 Brun telephoned us and told us that he had received a letter from Charles via the Felder Channel. This letter bore a New York City postmark. We gave information to Mr. Musulin. We told Brun that it is quite probable that Felder has a personal arrangement with unknown parties which permits him to use the diplomatic pouch facilities. Since we do not, letters can go only from Charles to Brun and not from Brun to Charles. Brun and we agreed that he will not henceforth attempt to use Felder to send letters to Charles.

6. Mr. Musulin agreed to retrieve the letter from the State Department and to send it to us. We shall return it forthwith to Brun.

Ma chère Sophie,

Cette lettre est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 mai écoulés et du 4 juin en cours.

Si tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis mon départ d'Haiti le 7 mai dernier, c'est que premièrement, je me proposais de retourner voir Clémard la semaine suivante. Le voyage a dû être différé lorsque j'ai su que Clémard avait, à nouveau, été arrêté le 11 mai. J'ai même eu à faire un câble à un ami pour lui annoncer mon arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en informer.

Deuxièmement, l'arrestation de Clémard ainsi que les nouvelles dor derniers événements en Haiti on eu des effets négatifs sur les négociations en cours que j'avais entamées pour Clémard et qui semblaient vouloir boutir. Je n'ai pas besoin de te dire combien j'en ai été bouleversé. Alors que nos amis d'ici et moi pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous estimons comme un frère, sa nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous nous remettons à peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre dévouement pour Clémard. Il sait, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne saurions jamais marchander notre concours à un ami pour qui nous avons a plus grande affection et pour qui nous sommes prêts à consentir tous les sacrifices personnels que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que si, en dehors d'Haiti, je n'arrive à le tirer de l'impasse dans laquelle il se trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre puisse réussir à le faire.

Nos puissants amis communs tant à New York, Washington, Miami et ailleurs ont tous manifesté un désir sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les limites de leurs possibilités respectives.

Depuis mon retour d'Haiti je me suis mis en action à cette fin et ai personelle- mont vu plusieurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à consacrer une grande partie de leur temps précieux à la concrétisation des plans que j'ai eu à envisager avec Clémard en vue de le tirer d'embarras le plus rapidement possible.

Fage 2

Kes espoirs de réussite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis contactés se sont heurtés aux effets négatifs inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arres- tation de Clémard que des derniers événements survenus en Haiti depuis le 20 mai écoulé. Je t'envoie, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces grenda azis, Mr. Howard Barris de Washington, D.C. Je te domande de garder cette lettre strictement confidentielle car je n'aurais pas aimé que le nom de Mr. Barris soit mentionné à quiconque en Haiti. Si cela arrivait, nous pourrions perdre un très bon ani.

Pour ton information, je te dirai que Mr. Durris est un colonel retraité du Corps de Génie de l'armée américaine, ani personnel et conseiller du Président Johnson et extrêmement influent à Washington tant dans le monde politique que finometer. J'ai eu à faire acux voyages à Washington entre le 8 et 11 mai au coura desquels lui et moi envisagions les moyens d'aider Clémard selon le "modus" envisagt. La copie de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te confirmer ce qui préodde.

J'ai aussi vu personnellement et lui ai causé maintos fois au téléphone, Joseph Dryer, qui devait se rendre en Haiti le 24 mai pour te vois mais qui a dû renvoyer son voyage après les nouvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion. Je lui ai encore causé récemment au téléphone et il a cu à me faire part des résultats négatifs de ses efforts, toujours en fonction des mêmes circonstances.

Le lettres adressées aux autres amis de l'étranger, dont Dabinovick, par example, sont restées jusqu'ici sans réponses. Je vais une nouvelle fois écrire longue- ment à Dabinovick pour lui transmettre ta dernière communication avec l'espoir d'avoir un mot encourageant de lui.

Comme tu dois le comprendre, ma chère Sophie, nos efforts, malgré toute notre bonne volonté, ne sauraient se concrétiser à brève échéance, car les valeurs en qucation qu'il nous shut trouver ne sont pas insimiriantes. Je te signalerai en passant un point qui a été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir qua mau ni noa min seraient en mesure d'avancer à Ciomard les valeurs nécessaires, ils ont des doutca sérieux non pas sur la sincóritó de Clémard à faire face aux, oblications qui devront être contractées, mais à la possibilité matérielle de ra- patrior, en dollars américains, los valeurs avanebos. J'ai personnellement nosiste A don contrain avec dea bruiqutora d'ici qui offliment qu'avant longtemps, lalti. nia wsqueplua de devinca-dollara pour solder sus comptes à l'étranger. Autant d'obataulus quo jo suis malheureusement obligó de te sigmaler pour que tu saches à quoi t'en tenir.

Concernant maintenant le grand banquier nois dont j'ai ou moi-même à dire à Cidmard que je croyais pouvoir nous aider, celui-ci a ou & me faire comprendre qu'il ne pouvait an l'occurrence intéresser son institution à une affaire de co genre qui comporte trop de risques. De ce côté là il n'y a donc pas grand espoir.

Ceci dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui sembleraient incurmontables, je n'ai pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'aider à sortir Clézard, sain et sauf, de la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, je le sais. L'essentiel est que le Chef lui-même soit persuadé que l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons à satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon imputables à Clémard mais plutôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.

Je prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finisse par réaliser que Clémard, en bon patriote haïtien, a eu foi en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, comme plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son intelligence productive.

Je me proposais d'écrire personnellement à Son Excellence le Président à Vie d'Haiti, pour implorer sa clémence et sa générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher. Je me suis alors demandé si c'était là un geste sage qui pourrait avoir la vertu de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'ai préférer m'abstenir.

Pour revenir maintenant aux possibilités de féaliser au moins pertiellement, la valcur exigée, je dois te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifier tout ce que nous pourrions entreprendre à cette fin.

Séparément, par cette même voie, je te communiquerai toutes les formalités à remplir pour nous mettre en mesure de réaliser dans un délai raisonable au moins le tiers dé la somme réclamée. Il serait souhaitable que tu sois mise en mesure de venir ici à New York, ce qui faciliterait beaucoup les choses, mais dans l'im- possibilité d'une pareille alternative, tu devrás donc agréer aux conditions stipulées. Il faudra donc agir avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller au plus vite.

Ma chère Sophie, je termineral cette lettre déjà longue et ardue en te renouvelant mon dévouement le plus entier à la cause de notre ami Clémard et en te priant une nouvelle fois de ne jamais douter do mes sentiments propres et ceux de ma famille pour Clémard, toi et les tiens.

Affections & Cros-Miche, Marie-Claudine, Toto, Eddie et sa femme.

Bon courage!

Mr. Louis A. Brún

ジュエヒa Avenue
New York, New York 10011

Dear Mr. Brun

I apologize for the delay in responding to your suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti. My activities hero have been such that I have been unable until the past day or so to give your proposal adequate thought and consideration.

First I must admit that the recent abortive invasion attempt caused certain reflection and it is this kind of activity, successful or unsuccessful, that could cro a serious dinlocations for those established in business. However I must assure you that this was only a reflecion and the reason that I will be unable to accen. your offer is the extent and nature of my activities here in Washington. I believe I alluded se some of them during your visit. The occasions when I would find it possible to visit Port-au-Prince or to : any sionificant amount of time to the bank's activities here would be rare indeed. shall coniess to you that I declined a similar position on a bank board here in the states for the same reason.

I regret that this locision is necessary but I hope that in future relationships we may be able to do something useful and successful in Haiti.

Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Letter from Louis A. Brun to FSO Felder

1. I talked with George Musulin (DCS/Ops Support Staff) at 0840 hours this morning about the letter mailed to FSO Felder at the American Embassy in Port au Prince. Musulin said that he had spoken with Brun about the letter and Brun had assured him that Felder said to mail letters to him through Foreign Service mail channels. Brun is in contact with Felder during his visits to Haiti and this system was laid on between them during ene of his trips.

2. Brun also said that he was a little upset about the problems which had arisen in sending his letter. Brun said that he had received a letter from Felder (mailed in New York City) saying that he had never received the letter from Brun. Brun was concerned that the letter may have fallen into the wrong hands in Haiti. Musulin said that he would try to recover the letter and send it back to Brun.

3. I told Musulin that Ambassador Ross was very much disturbed about this matter and that any further involvement by the Agency with correspondence between Brun and Felder should be avoided. Brun is a business agent of Clemard Joseph-Charles and thus any correspondence between Brun and an official of the American Embassy is of particular concern to the Ambassador because of the obvious political implications. Musulin said he understood this and would tell Brun that the dispatch of any correspondence in the future would be his own responsibility.

This letter was to be sent by State Department diplomatic pouch to Mr. Robert C. Felder, United States Babassy, Port-au- Prince, Haiti, ari given by him to Charles. Brun had told us that Felder had agreed to act as intermediary for correspondence between himself and Charles and added that he and Charles, had already used the system. The letter in Reference "A" was the first time ve had been approached in the matter.

2.  Reference "B" stated that the latter had been dispatched via Message Center Courier to the State Department on 24 June 1968.

3.  On or about 26 June 1968 Brun telephoned us and stated that Charles had not received the letter. We telephoned Mr. Musulin, who double-checked and assured us that the letter had gone to the State Department and that it should go out in the next pouch.

4.  On 10 July 1968, Brun telephoned us and stated that on 9 July 1968 he had received a telephone call from a Ray Alvares. Alvares identified himself as a State Department employee in Washington and told Brun that he had the letter destined for Charles. Alvares then told Brun that he would return the letter if Brun would tell him how it had reached the State Department. Brun refused to give Alvares any information. We then telephoned Mr. Musulin and relayed the foregoing in- formation. Mr. Musulin inquired into the metter and learned that the letter had gone to Haiti in the State Departuunt pouch, had not been delivered to Folder and had been returned to Washington. He and ve surmised that the State Department did

not wish to lay itself open to the charge of becoming embroiled in local Haitian politics and so had refused to deliver the letter to Felder. We reported this information to Brun.

5. On 11 July 1968 Brun telephoned us and told us that he had received a letter from Charles via the Folder channel. This letter bore a New York City postmark. We gave this information to Mr. Musulin. We told Brun that it is quite probable that Felder has a personal arrangement with unknown parties which permits him to use the diplomatic pouch facilities. Since we do not, letters can go only from Charles to Brun and not from Brun to Charles. Brun and we agreed that he will not henceforth attempt to use Felder to send letters to Charles.

6. Mr. Musulin agreed to retrieve the letter from the State Department and to send it to us. We shall return it forthwith to Brun.

Mne Clémard Joseph Charles
Port-au-Prince
Haiti

Ma chère Sophie,

Cette lettre est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 mai
écoulés et du 4 juin en cours.

Si tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis mon départ d'Haiti le 7 mai dernier,
c'est que premièrement, je me proposais de retourner voir Clémard la semaine
suivante. Le voyage a dû être différé lorsque j'ai su que Clémard avait, à
nouveau, été arrêté le ll mai. J'ai même eu à faire un câble à un ami pour
lui annoncer mon arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en informer.

Dueièmement, l'arrestation de Clémard ainsi que les nouvelles der derniers
événements en Haiti on eu des effets négatifs sur les négociations en cours
que j'avais entamées pour Clémard et qui semblaient vouloir aboutir. Je n'ai
pas besoin de te dire combien j'en ai été bouleversé. Alors que nos amis
d'ici et moi pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous estimons comme un frère,
sa nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous
nous remettons à peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre
dévouement pour Clémard. Il sait, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne
saurions Jamais marchander notre concours à un ami pour qui nous avons la plus
grande affection et pour qui nous sommes prêts à consentir tous les sacrifices
personnels que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que
si, en dehors d'Haiti, je n'arrive à le tirer de l'impasse dans laquelle il se
trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre puisse
réussir à le faire.

Nos puissants amis communs tant à New York, Washington, Miami et ailleurs ont
tous manifesté un désir sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les limites de leurs
possibilités respectives.

Depuis mon retour d'Haiti je me suis mis en action à cette fin et ai personelle-
mont vu plusieurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à
consacrer une grande partie de leur temps précieux à la concrétaration des plans
que j'ai eu à envisager aved Clémard en vue de lo tirer d'embarras le plus
rapidement possible.

Face 2

Nes espoirs de réussite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis contactés se sont heurtés aux effets négatifs inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arrestation de Clémard que des derniers événements survemus en Halti depuis le 20 mai écoulé. Je t'envoie, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces grends amics, Mr. Howard Durris de Washington, D.C. Je te demande de garder cette lettre strictement confidentielle car je n'aurais pas aimé que le nom de Mr. Burris soit mentionné à quiconque en Haiti. Si cela arrivait, nous pourrions perdre un très bon ami.

Pour ton information, je te dirai que Mr. Durris est un colonel retraité du Corps de Génie de l'armée américaine, ami personnel et conseiller dụ Président Johnson et extrêmement influent à Washington tant dans le monde politique que financier. J'ai eu à faire deux voyages à Washington entre le 8 ct 11 mai au cours desquels lui et moi envisagions les moyens d'aider Clémard selon le "modus" envisagé. La copie de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te confirmer ce qui précède.

J'ai aussi vu personnellement et lui ai causé maintes fois au téléphone, Joseph Dryer, qui devait se rendre en laiti le 24 mai pour te vois mais qui a dû renvoyer son voyage après les nouvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion.. Je lui ai encore causé récemment au téléphone et il a eu à me faire part des résultats négatifs de ses efforts, toujours en fonction des mêmes circonstances..

Le lettres adressées aux autres amis de l'étranger, dont Dabinovick, par example, sont restées jusqu'ici sans réponses. Je vais une nouvelle fois écrire longuement à Dabinovick pour lui transmettre ta dernière communication avec l'espoir d'avoir un mot encourageant de lui.

Comme tu dois le comprendre, ma chère Sophie, nos efforts, malgré toute notre bonne volonté, ne sauraient se concrétiser à brève échéance, car les valeurs en question qu'il nous faut trouver ne sont pas insignifiantes. Je te signalerai en passant un point qui a été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir que même si nos amin seraient en mesure d'avancer à Clémard les valeurs nécessaires, ils ont des doutes sérioux non pas sur la sincérité de Clémard à faire face aux obligations qui devront être contractées, mais à la possibilité matérielle de rapatrier, en dollars américains, les valeurs avancées. J'ai personnellement assisté à des contacts avec des banquiers d'ici qui affirment qu'avant longtemps, Haiti n'aura prosque plus de dovisos-dollars pour solder ses comptes à l'étranger. Autant d'obstacles que je suis malheureusemont obligé de te signaler pour que tu saches A.quoi t'en tenir.

Concernant maintenant le grand banquier noit dont j'ai eu moi-même à dire à Clémard que je croyais pouvoir nous aider, celui-ci a ou à me faire comprendre qu'il ne pouvait an l'occurrence intéresser son institution à une affaire de ce genre qui comporte trop de risques. De ce côté là il n'y a donc pas grand espoir.

Ceci dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui sembleraient insurmontables, je n'ai pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'aider à sortir Clémard, sain et sauf, de la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, je le sais. L'essentiel est que le Chef lui-même soit persuadé que l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons à satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune r'açon imputables à Clémard mais plutôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.

Je prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finisse par réaliser que Clémard, en bon patriote haïtien, a eu foi en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, comme plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son intclligence pro- ductive.

Je me proposais d'écrire personnellement à Son Excellence le Président à Vie d'Haiti, pour implorer sa clémence et sa générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher. Je me suis alors demandé si c'était là un goste sage qui pourrait avoir la vertu de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'ai préférer m'abstenir.

Pour revenir maintenant aux possibilités de féaliser au moins partiellement, la valeur exigée, je dois te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifier tout ce que nous pourrions entreprendre à cette fin.

Séparément, par cette même voie, je te communiquerai toutes les formalités à remplir pour nous mettre en mesure de réaliser dans un délai raisonable au moins le tiers de la somme réclamée. Il serait souhaitable que tu sois mise en mesure de venir ici à New York, co qui faciliterait beaucoup les choses, mais dans l'im- possibilité d'une pareille alternative, tu devras donc agréer aux conditions stipulées. Il faudra donc agir avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller au plus vite.

Ma chère Sophie, je termineral cette lettre déjà longue et ardue en te renou- velant mon dévouement le plus entier à la cause de notre ami Clémard et en te priant une nouvelle fois de ne jamais doutor de mes sentiments propres et ceux de ma famille pour Clémard, toi et les tiens.

Affections à Gros-Miche, Marie-Claudine, Toto, Eddie et sa femme.

Bon courage!

Dear Mr. Brun

I apologize for the delay in responding to your suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti. My activities here have been such that I have been unable until the past day or so to give your proposal adequate thought and consideration.

First I must admit that the recent abortive invasion attempt caused certain reflection and it is this kind of activity, successful or unsuccessful, that could cro a serious dislocations for those established in business. However I must assure you that this was only a reflection and the reason that I will be unable to accer: your offer is the extent and nature of my activities here in Washington. I believe I alluded to some of them during your visit. The occasions when I would find it possible to visit Port-au-Prince or to deur any significant amount of time to the bank's activities here would lm rare indeed. I shall coniess to you that I declined a similar position on a bank board here in the states for the same reason.

I regret that this decision is necessary but I hope that in future relationships we may be able to do somothing useful and successful in Haiti.

Sincerely,

Howard P. Burris

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Letter from Louis A. Brun to FSO Polder

1. I talked with George Musulin (DCS/Ops Support Staff) at 0840 hours this morning about the letter mailed to FSO Felder at the American Embassy in Port au Prince. Musulin said that he had spoken with Brun about the letter and Brun had assured him that Felder said to mail letters to him through Foreign Service mail channels. Brun is in contact with Felder during his visits to Haiti and this system was laid on between them during one of his trips.

2. Brun also said that he was a little upset about the problems which had arisen in sending his letter. Brun said that he had received a letter from Felder (mailed in New York City) saying that he had never received the letter from Brun. Brun was concerned that the letter may have fallen into the wrong hands in Haiti. Musulin said that he would try to recover the letter and send it back to Brun.

3. I told Musulin that Ambassador Ross was very much disturbed about this matter and that any further involvement by the Agency with correspondence between Brun and Felder should be avoided. Brun is a business agent of Clemard Joseph-Charles and thus any correspondence between Brun and an official of the American Embassy is of particular concern to the Ambassador because of the obvious political implications. Musulin said he understood this and would tell Brun that the dispatch of any correspondence in the future would be his own responsibility.

Letter from Louis A. Brun to Clemard Joseph Charles (to be Forwarded
Via Robert C. Felder, United States Embassy, Port-au-Prince, Haiti)

REFERENCES: (A) NY-467-68 (20 June 1968); (B) CONTACTO/WASHINGTON 80540;
(C) Case 47,540

1. Reference "A" forwarded to you a letter from Louis
   A. Brun, BAM International Corporation, 134 Fifth Avenue, New
   York, New York, to Clemard Joseph Charles, Port-au-Prince,
   Haiti. This letter was to be sent by State Department diplomatic
   pouch to Mr. Hubert C. Felder, United States Embassy, Port-au-
   Prince, Haiti, and given by him to Charles. Brun had told us
   that Felder had agreed to act as intermediary for correspondence
   between himself and Charles and added that he and Charles had
   already used the system. The letter in Reference "A" was the
   first time we had been approached in the matter.

2. Reference "B" stated that the letter had been dispatched
   via Message Center Courier to the State Department on 24 June
1968. 
3. On or about 26 June 1968 Brun telephoned us and stated
   that Charles had not received the letter. We telephoned Mr.
   Musulin, who double-checked and assured us that the letter had
   gone to the State Department and that it should go out in the
   next pouch.

4. On 10 July 1968, Brun telephoned us and stated that
   on 9 July 1968 he had received a telephone call from a Ray
   Alvarez. Alvarez identified himself as a State Department
   employee in Washington and told Brun that he had the letter
   destined for Charles. Alvarez then told Brun that he would
   return the letter if Brun would tell him how it had reached the
   State Department. Brun refused to give Alvarez any information.
   We then telephoned Mr. Musulin and relayed the foregoing in-
   formation. Mr. Musulin inquired into the matter and learned
   that the letter had gone to Haiti in the State Department pouch,
   had not been delivered to Felder and had been returned to
   Washington. He and we surmised that the State Department did

not wish to lay itself open to the charge of becoming embroiled in local Haitian politics and so had refused to deliver the letter to Felder. We reported this information to Brun.

5. On 11 July 1968 Brun telephoned us and tolt us that he had received a letter from Charles via the Folder channel. This letter bore a New York City postmark. We gave this information to Mr. Musulin. We told Brun that it is quite probauiم that Felder has a personal arrangement with unknown parties which permits him to use the diplomatic pouch facilities. Since we do not, letters can go only from Charles to Brun and not from Brun to Carles. Brun and we agreed that he will not henceforth attempt to use Felder to send letters to Charles.

6. Mr. Musulin agreed to retrieve the letter from the State Department and to send it to us. We shall return is forthwith to Brun.

Mae Clémard Joseph Charles
Port-au-Prince
Haiti

Ma chère Sophie,

Cette lettre est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 mai
écoulés et du 4 juin en cours.

Si tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis mon départ d'Haiti le 7 mai dernier,
c'est que premièrement, Je me proposais de retourner voir Clémard la semaine
suivante. Le voyage a dû être différé lorsque j'ai su que Clémard avait, à
nouveau, été arrêté le ll mai. J'ai même eu à faire un câble à un ami pour
lui annoncer mon arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en informer.

Dueièrement, l'arrestation de Clémard ainsi que les nouvelles der derniers
événements en Haiti on eu des effets négatifs sur les négociations en cours
que j'avais entamées pour Clémard et qui semblaient vouloir aboutir. Je n'ai
pas besoin de te dire combien j'en ai été bouleversé. Alors que nos amis
d'ici et moi pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous estimons comme un frère,
sa nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous
nous remettons à peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre
dévouement pour Clémard. Il sait, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne
saurions jamais marchander notre concours à un ami pour qui nous avons à plus
grande affection et pour qui nous sommes prêts à consentir tous les sacrifices
personnels que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que
si, en dehors d'Haiti, je n'arrive à le tirer de l'impasse dans laquelle il se
trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre puisse
réussir à le faire.

Nos puissants amis communs tant à New York, Washington, Miami et ailleurs ont
tous manifesté un désir sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les limites de leurs
possibilités respectives.

Depuis mon retour d'Haiti je me suis mis en action à cette fin et ai personelle-
ment vu plusieurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à
consacrer une grande partie de leur temps précieux à la concrétisation des plans
que j'ai eu à envisager aved Clémard en vue de le tirer d'embarras le plus
rapidement possible.

SECRET

Fage 2

Mes espoirs de réussite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis contactés se sont heurtés aux effets négatifs inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arrestation de Clémard que des derniers événements survenus en Haiti depuis le 20 mai écoulé. Je t'envoie, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces grands amis, Mr. Howard Burris de Washington, D.C. Je te demande de garder cette lettre strictement confidenticlle car je n'aurais pas aimé que le nom de Mr. Burris soit mentionné à quiconque en Haiti. Si cela arrivait, nous pourrions perdre un très bon ami.

Pour ton information, je te dirai que Mr. Burris est un colonel retraité du Corps de Génie de l'armée américaine, ami personnel et conseiller du Président Johnson et extrêmement influent à Washingtor tant dans le monde politique que financier. J'ai eu à faire deux voyages à Washington entre le 8 et 11 mai au cours desquels lui et moi envisagions les moyens d'aider Clémard selon le "modus" envisagé. La copie de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te confirmer ce qui précède.

J'ai aussi vu personnellement et lui ai causé maintes fois au téléphone, Joseph Dryer, qui devait se rendre en Haiti le 24 mai pour te vois mais qui a dû renvoyer son voyage après les nouvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion. Je lui ai encore causé récemment au téléphone et il a eu à me faire part des résultats négatifs de ses efforts, toujours en fonction des mêmes circonstances.

Le lettres adressées aux autres amis de l'étranger, dont Dabinovick, par example, sont restées jusqu'ici sans réponses. Je vais une nouvelle fois écrire longuement à Dabinovick pour lui transmettre ta dernière communication avec l'espoir d'avoir un mot encourageant de lui.

Comme tu dois le comprendre, ma chère Sophie, nos efforts, malgré toute notre bonne volonté, ne sauraient se concrétiser à brève échéance, car les valeurs en question qu'il nous faut trouver ne sont pas insignifiantes. Je te signalerai en passant un point qui a été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir que même si nos amin seraient en mesure d'avancer à Clémard les valeurs nécessaires, ils ont des doutes sérioux non pas sur la sincérité de Clémard à faire face aux obligations qui devront être contractées, mais à la possibilité matérielle de rapatrier, en dollars américains, les valeurs avancées. J'ai personnellement assisté à des contacts avec des banquiers d'ici qui affirment qu'avant longtemps, Haiti n'aura presque plus de devises-dollars pour solder ses comptes à l'étranger. Autant d'obstacles que je suis malheureusement obligé de te signaler pour que tu saches a.quoi t'en tenir.

Concernant maintenant le grand banquier noir dont j'ai eu moi-même à dire à Clémard que je croyais pouvoir nous aider, celui-ci a eu à me faire comprendre qu'il ne pouvait an l'occurrence intéresser son institution à une affaire de ce genre qui comporte trop de risques. De cu cotó là 11 n'y a donc pas grand espoir,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

Page 3

Ceci dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui sembleraient insurmontables, je n'al pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'aider à sortir Clémard, sain et sauf, de la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, je le sais. L'essentiel est que le Chef lui-même soit pereuadé que l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons à satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon imputables à Clémard mais plutôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté...

Je prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finisse par réaliser que Clémard, en bon patriote haïtien, a eu foi en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, comme plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son intelligence pro-ductive.

Je me proposais d'écrire personnellement à Son Excellence le Président à Vie d'Haiti, pour implorer sa clémence et sa générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher. Je me suis alors demandé si c'était là un geste sage qui pourrait avoir la vertu de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'ai préférer m'abstenir.

Pour revenir maintenant aux possibilités de féaliser au moins partiellement, la valeur exigée, je dois te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifier tout ce que nous pourrions entreprendre à cette fin.

Séparément, par cette même voie, je te communiquerai toutes les formalités à remplir pour nous mettre en mesure de réaliser dans un délai raisonable au moins le tiers de la somme réclamée. Il serait souhaitable que tu sois mise en mesure de venir ici à New York, co qui faciliterait beaucoup les choses, mais dans l'im-possibilité d'une pareille alternative, tu devras donc agréer aux conditions stipulées. Il faudra donc agir avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller au plus vite.

Ma chère Sophie, je terminerai cette lettre déjà longue et ardue en te renou-velant mon dévouement le plus entier à la cause de notre ami Clémard et en te priant une nouvelle fois de ne jamais douter de mes sentiments propres et ceux de ma famille pour Clémard, toi et les tiens.

Affections à Gros-Miche, Marie-Claudine, Toto, Eddie et sa femme.

Bon courage!

Mr. Louis A. Brún

Dear Mr. Brun

I apologize for the delay in responding to your suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti. My activities here have been such that I have been unable until the past day or so to give your proposal adequate thought and consideration.

First I must admit that the recent abortive invasion attempt caused certain reflection and it is this kind of activity, successful or unsuccessful, that could cre a serious dislocations for those established in business. However I must assure you that this was only a reflection and the reason that I will be unable to accep your offer is the extent and nature of my activities here in Washington. I believe I alluded to some of them during your visit. The occasions when I would find it possible to visit Port-au-Prince or to dewr any significant amount of time to the bank's activities nere would be rare indeed. I shall coniess to you that I declined a similar position on a bank board here in the stater for the same reason.

I regret that this decision is necessary but I hope that ir future relationships we may be able to do something useful and successful in Haiti..

Sincerely,

27 June 1968
DCS Case: 67,540

SUBJECT: Clerard Joseph Charles Has Gained Postponement of
Deadline for Ransom Payment/Charles' relationship with Rene
Adrien and Yvon Saint-Victor and Background of his nearest/
President Duvalier's Need for Money May Possibly Induce Him to
Accept Scheme for Reorganized Banque Commerciale d'Haiti

1. Recently-released Clerard Joseph Charles has received a postponement of the deadline by which he must produce the US$605 thousand required as "ransom" for his permanent release. The new deadline is late September 1968.

2. Shortly before Charles' rearrest in May 1968 Rene Adrien visited him at his residence and remonstrated with him. Adrien, one of the directors of the Banque Nationale de la Republique d'Haiti (BNRH), told Charles that he (Charles) had not done enough since his release to procure the US$605 thousand and added that Charles was receiving too many visitors. Charles responded with such a tirade of abuse that Adrien left the house. Charles was rearrested that same afternoon. At about the same time, Yvon Saint-Victor visited Charles and talked to him in much the same vein as had Adrien. Charles' response to Saint-Victor was about the same as his answer to Adrien. Saint-Victor's wife is President Duvalier's secretary.

3. Since his release in June 1968, Charles has agreed to intensify his efforts to raise the US$605 thousand and to cease receiving so many visitors at his house.

4. Charles will undoubtedly revive the scheme to raise the US$605 thousand through subscription by foreign investors and to place it in a reorganized Banque Commerciale d'Haiti (BCH). [Collector's Note: this plan is outlined in 00-A(8) 322/14367-68 (Paragraph Two). Alternatively, he may try to interest the Government of Haiti (GOH) in his visible cash assets and OOH bonds now on deposit in banks in New York City (Collector's Note: see 00-A(8) 322/14367-68 (Paragraphs Three, Four and Five.) See also 00-A(8) 322/17056-68.

to get the required suza into Baiti and at the same time to ensure that it vould not simply be confiscated by the O0ff. The idea was born because Charles and his friends relt (and still feel) that if he simply handed over US$605 thousand he would then be liquidated. Thus, the BCH schame vould serve as a sort of Insurance policy on Charles' life. On the other hand, it is possible that the Oull would refuse to accept the BCH scheme as a substitute for a direct payment and would continue to insist on the direct payment of the Ust005 thousand as ransom. It is possible, however, for the following reasons that hes- ident Duvalier would consent to the DCH scheme. First, he is desperate for money and does not much care in just vint form is my enter Haiti. Second, he approaches his problems on a day-to-day basis and does not plan tar lito the future. Third, he is obsessed with the idea of retaining power for life. Now, Duvalier is perfectly well avare, I am sure, that the BCH scheme will not net him 088605 thousand. On the wwwi land, however, he is quite anxious for foreign investors to place their money in Haiti, both for the economic benefits which such investments will bring to kniti and also for the propaganda value which a nov foreign business will bring to him. If he liquidates Charles, either before or after receiving the U88605 thousand, he vill suffer nuch unfavorable publicity. It is possible, too, that he may think that he may be able to get his hands on the US$605 thousand even though it may be tied up in the BCH scheme. In any event, Charles is, I believe, going to make the effort to induce the President to allow the BCH schems and thereby to bring an end to the "ranson" domaces.

LOUIS A. ELIE
153 Fifth Ave.
New York, N.Y.

Le 14 Juin 1968

Me Clézard Joseph Charles
Port-au-Prince
Haïti

Ma chère Sophie,

Cette lettre est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 mai écoulés et du 4 juin en cours.

Si tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis son départ d'Haïti le 7 mai dernier, c'est que transitoirement, je me proposais de retourner voir Clézard la semaine suivante. Le voyage a dû être différé lorsque j'ai su que Clézard avait, à nouveau, été arrêté le 11 mai. J'ai alors eu à faire un câble à un ami pour lui annoncer mon arrivées et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en informer.

Doultoureusement, l'arrestation de Clézard ainsi que les nouvelles des derniers événements en Haïti a eu des effets négatifs sur les négociations en cours que j'avais entamées pour Clézard et qui semblaient vouloir aboutir. Je n'ai pas besoin de te dire combien j'en ai été bouleversé. Alors que nos amis d'ici et moi pensions pouvoir aider Clézard que nous estimons comme un frère, sa nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous nous ressentons à peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre dévouement pour Clézard. Il l'était, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne saurions jamais marchander notre concours à un ami pour qui nous avons la plus grande affection et pour qui nous sommes prêts à consentir tous les sacrifices personnels que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que si, en dehors d'Haïti, je n'arrive à le tirer de l'impasse dans laquelle il se trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre puisse réussir à le faire.

Nos puissants amis communs tant à New York, Washington, Miami et ailleurs ont tous manifesté un désir sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les limites de leurs possibilités respectives.

Depuis mon retour d'Haïti je me suis mis en action à cette fin et ai personnelle- ment vu plusieurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à consacrer une grande partie de leur temps précieux à la concrétisation des plans que j'ai eu à envisager avec Clézard en vue de le tirer d'embarras le plus rapidement possible.

Je t'emolo, pour preuve, copio d'una lettre d'un de ces ands ais, ir. Etart Darria da Washington, D.C. Je to do do carder cctta lettro strictement ccaficentielle car je n'aurais e its que le nom do is. Darris coit Ecational a quiccaue en Kaiti. Si cela arrivait, nous pourrions parire un très bon cai.

Four ton information, jo to dirai que Mr. Durris est un colcial retraité du Corps de Gate de l'erne züricains, cat personnel et ceaseiller du Président Johnson et extrêmcaent influent & Washington tant dans le mois politique que financier. J'ai cu à faire doux voyages Kachington entre 10 8 et 11 mai au cours acaquela lai ot col cavicagiona les moyens d'aider Client celon le "modus" cavicagé. La copio do ca lettre du 7 Juin en cours coura te confirmer ce qui pricade.

J'ai cucai vu personnellement et lui at cauco raintca fois au téléphone, Joseph Dryer, qui covait ca readro en lasti lo 24 mai pour te vols mais qui á dû reavoyer con voyaga eprès les nouvelles de la dernière tentativa d'invesion. Jo lui ai encore causi riccent cu téléphone et il a cu à ce faire part des résultats négatifs de ses efforts, toujours en fonction des cĉacs circonstances.

Le lottrea cărescées cux cutres cals de l'étranger, dent Dadinovick, par example, sont restles jusqu'ici cans réponses. Je vais une nouvello fola écrire longuo-mont & Dabinovich your lui trancaottie ta derniir communication avce l'espoir d'avoir un cot cncouragcant de lui.

Comme tu dois le comprendre, ca chère Cophie, nos efforts, calgré toute notre bonne volcat, no curaicat co concrétiser & brèvo (chlance, car los valeurs en question qu'il nous faut trouver no sont pas insicificntes. Jo te signalerai en pessant un polut qui a Cti cculové au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir que es el nos cals ecraicat ca escure d'avancer à Clémard les valeurs nécessaires, ils ont des acutes córicas non pas sur la sincerito de Cleanl à faire face aux obligations qui devreat Otro contractées, mais à la possibilité matérielle de ra-patrior, en Collera exéricains, les valeurs avenečes. J'ai personnellement acsisté à des eontacts erce des banquiera d'ici qui affirment qu'avant longtemps, Haiti n'aura presque plus do doviccs-dollara pour colder ces ccaptes à l'étranger. Autant d'obstacles que je suis malhaircusesant obligi do to signaler pour que tu saches. A quoi t'en tenir.

Concernant maintenant le grand bamiter noit dont j'ai eu moi-acne à dire a Cleard que je crejala pouvoir nous aider, celui-ci a cu a ne faire comprendre qu'il ne pouvait ca l'occurruco intéresser een institution & uno affaire de ce gtare qui comporte trop de risques. De ce côté là il n'y a donc pas grand espoir.

Coel dit, ralgré tous ces obstacles qui cebicrafeat insureentables, jo n'ai res totalecat par l'capoir de pouvoir t'cider à cortir Clard, cain et if, ia la pricca ca ca canto co citricra rapidement, je lo cais. L'essentiel cat cua io Cier lut-cs colt persuadé que l'irabilité que reis éprouvans & catisfaire les exigences du rezent, no scat ca cacuns facea imputables à Clémard rais plutôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.

Je prie Dicu Tout-puissent pour que l'on finiece par réaliser que Clémard, en boa patriote haïtien, a cu foi en con pays et n'a pas ciu bon d'expatrier, coome plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ecs curs labours et de ton intelligence pro-ductive.

Je za proposais d'écrire perconnellement à Son Excellence le Président à Vie d'Eaiti, rour inplorer ca clémenco ct ca générosité pour un cai qui nous est cher. Je ne cuia alors dandó si c'était là un gesto cars qui pourrait avoir la vortu de 1'(parinor et, dans le douto, j'ai préférer u'abstenir.

Pour revenir maintenant cus possibilités do fcalicor au moins partiellement, la valeur exigée, jo dola te dire que je cuis heureux do cavoir que tu dótiens une procuration généralo en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifior tout ce que nous pourrions entreprendre à cotto fin.

Séparent, par cotto e voic, jo to communiquerai toutes les formalités à reaplir pour nous ecitro en cesure de réaliser dans un délai raicenable au moins le tiera de la come réclamée. Il cerait souhaitable que tu cois nice en mesure de venir ici à New York, ce qui feciliterait beaucoup les choses, mais dans l'im-possibilité d'une pareille alternativo, tu dovras done agréer cux conditions stipulćes. Il faudra donc agir avec dilligenco pour nous permettre d'aller cu plus vite.

Ma chère Sophie, jo temineral cette lettre déjà longue et ardue en te renou-velant con dévouement le plus entier à la cause de notre rai Climard et en te pricat une nouvelle fois de no jamais douter de mcs sontinents propres et coux de za famille pour Climard, toi et les Sions.

Affections à Gros-Miche, Marie-Claudine, Toto, Eddie et sa femme.

Bon courage!

Invariablement,

Supplement to: 00-A(8) 322/14367-68

1.  During the week of 27 May 1963, the Government of Haiti (GOH) is reported to have carried out many executions among the prisoners held in Fort Dimanche prison. Cleamard Joseph Charles, Haitian banker, was not among those executed, because his life was spared on direct orders from President Duvalier.

2.  The GOH is becoming more insistent than ever that Charles produce the ransom of US$405 thousand, which it has set as the price for his release. Charles now seems to feel that if he does not produce the money, he will be executed. During May 1963, he gave to his wife, Madame Sophie Ladouceur Charles, a general power of attorney. This power of attorney gives to Mme Charles the right to function as her husband's alter ego and sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of his assets.

3.  Charles still has the US$100 thousand in cash in New York City banks (Collector's Note: See reference, Paragraph Four). His holdings in GOH bonds total US$400 thousand (Collector's Note: See reference, Paragraph Two). These bonds are guaranteed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Mme Charles is now endeavoring to collect the US$100 thousand cash and to pledge as collateral the US$400 thousand in GOH bonds, in the hope that the GOH will accept as payment of the US$405 thousand ransom whatever she is able to realize from the bonds plus the total of the cash. She hopes to place this sum in the reorganized Banque Commerciale d'Haiti (BCH) (Collector's Note: See reference, Paragraph Two) and hopes that the GOH will accept that as the payment of the ransom.

4.  Charles is not being treated as well in Fort Dimanche

as he had been before his release in late April 1960. The Fort Dimanche authorities now refuse to accept food and clothing parcels sent to Charles from the outside. In consequence, he is still wearing the clothes in which he was arrested in May 1960 and is compelled to subsist solely on the regular prison meals. During his previous incarceration he was permitted to receive food and clothing from the outside and lived not too badly.

5. The following individual is a good friend of Charles.

![illegible symbol] of re 35-34 Dubinovits Dabimar
1:0160/u2

![illegible symbol] 4 Quiva, Switzerland

Collector's Note: Hourve did not volunteer Dabimar's postal address; we did not judge it suitable to press him for it. We do not know the significance of the number listed above. We copied the above name and address from an envelope addressed by Mme Charles to Dabimar. Dabimar is a Swiss citizen who owns a fleet of cargo ships. Until about 1961 or 1962 he had a contract with the GOH, under the provisions of which he sailed his ships under the Haitian flag. The GOH ultimately canceled the contract, because, I understand, Dabimar failed to pay the royalties called for under the terms of the contract. Dabimar is opposed to President Duvalier, because the latter canceled the contract just discussed, but is (or was) interested in developing projects (no additional data available) in Haiti. The letter which Mme Charles has just addressed to Dabimar contains an urgent appeal for financial assistance.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE

Naturalized US citizen of Haitian birth, official of a US import-export enterprise. Source makes occasional trips to Haiti and has many contacts among Haitian business and political figures both in the US and in Haiti.

1.  The Government of Haiti (GOH) has issued claims that the invaders of 20 May 68 have been wiped out and that total victory against them has been achieved. A special Thanksgiving mass was celebrated recently in Port-au-Prince to commemorate and celebrate the event. On the surface, things are politically quiet.

2.  The realities seem, however, to differ to a marked degree from the foregoing. Although the populace has remained quiet, it does not believe the GOH claims of total victory. In point of fact, the invaders have not been wiped out and they have succeeded in gaining of control of the small town of Quartier Morin and of the Citadelle Laferriere (both situated near Cap Haitien). The GOH has decided not to begin military operations against them, but to adopt a defensive attitude and wait and see what happens. The GOH realizes that to dislodge the rebels from the citadel, which is located in very rugged terrain, would be extremely difficult militarily and would be quite inadvisable politically, because the citadel has strong emotional historical associations for Haitians. To bombard it into rubble, which would be the only feasible way to recapture it, would create resentment among the populace. Accordingly, the GOH seems prepared to do nothing, in the hope that the rebels will fade away. Such an eventuality seems unlikely, however, because the invaders have not only succeeded in gaining control of the two above-mentioned places, but also have succeeded in rallying about 140 of the local populace to their side. Reports in the US Spanish-language press of 12 Jun 68 stated that the rebel force is now 300 strong and that 140 of these are local people who have rallied to them. My information corroborates those figures. The populace in Port-au-Prince expects further action from the rebels. The latest rumor: (and the word "rumors" must be emphasized) in Port-au-Prince are that another invasion will be launched into southern Haiti this time, and that Cuba has infiltrated a number of illegal entrants

2.  Into Baiti (not into the present rebel force). I have no way of knowing whether or not there is any substance to these rumors.

3.  The latest invasion was launched from Inagon Island, Babara Islands. The mayor of Cap Haitien went personally to Port-au-Prince to ask for troops to defend his area. He received none. The invaders themselves and Haitian exiles in general are now all very optimistic, after having been quite depressed at the beginning of the invasion.

4.  The GOH, which seems to be about to sit tight and await further action by the rebels, has not been idle in dealing with the local population. During the week of 27 May '8, many people (no additional data available) were arrested. And the GOH has executed about 100 of the prisoners held in Fort Dimanche prison. The well-known banker, Clemard Joseph Charles, was not, however, among those executed. His life was spared on specific instructions from President Duvalier.

5.  During the recent debate in the United Nations Security Council concerning the Haitian complaint about the invasion, Haitian ambassador AlexanderBonhomme stated that Joan Theard, Haitian diplomat, had been killed by the invaders. This is not true. Theard was, in fact, killed by GOH troops. He had gone to Cap Haitien to make-some sort of survey designed to put a sugar mill there into working order.

6.  There are a number of Syrians in Haiti. These individuals are sensitive to the directions in which political winds are blowing. I learned that one of these Syrian businessman is, for the first time, considerably worried about the outcome of the invasion. Previous invasions have left him totally unperturbed. Now, however, he is worried, because he has for some years done business with the GOH and fears reprisals at the hands of a new government.

Washingtonian Howard L. Burris Begged to Accept Chairmanship of

1. Contact Specialist R.K. Oakley of the Washington Field Office
   21 May 1968 received a telephone communication from Howard Burris,
   1725 K Street, N.W. Washington, D.C., a wealthy Texas oil man
   currently engaged primarily in real estate development in this area.
   Considerable background is afforded in the memoranda under reference
   but, briefly, Burris (Colonel, USAF retired) is a former chief of
   Air Force Foreign Liaison and later was attached to the White House
   Staff, prior to his retirement a few years ago. His social contacts
   in Washington at present reach well into both Kennedy and (President)
   Johnson circles. The US citizen of Haitian origin mentioned below
   is the same as that referred to in the earlier memorandum under
   reference. He is said to travel "freely" between his house in New
   York City and Fort au Prince.

2. Burris recently had a visit from Louis A Brum of B. & B.
   International Corporation, 134 Fifth Avenue, New York City, a US
   citizen of Haitian origin whom he has known for several years. Brum
   brought a letter from Clemard Joseph Charles dated 6 May 1968 in Port
   au Prince. A copy is attached but in essence it says he, Charles, was
   illegally imprisoned for ten months but now is released. As President
   of the Commercial Bank of Haiti in Port au Prince, Charles professes
   great interest in the patriotic duty of developing his country econo-
   mically. He states that the bearer, Mr. Brun, is charged with presenting
   verbally a proposition from him, Charles. He also asked Burris to deliver
   a letter addressed to Vice President Humphrey. (Burris declined and
   suggested it be sent through the mails.)

3. About a year ago Brum approached Burris in Charles' behalf,
   urging Burris to buy at a low price, stock in the Commercial Bank of
   Haiti, and to accept a directorship if not the Chairmanship of the Board.
   On the latest visit Brum opportuned Burris to buy 50 to 51 percent
   of the stock at a "nominal fee, probably US$1.00 and other considerations"
   and definitely to accept the Chairmanship. Burris is not interested

because he thinks this would be merely an opening gambit to attract investment funds from Burris' contacts. Moreover, he is not sanguine about the prospects in Haiti at present, to use understatement. However, Oakley has reason to believe that Burris might be cooperative should it suit official purposes to have him become involved. This aspect was not discussed in the least.

4. Burris says that Brun and Charles are somehow involved with the Bank of Nova Scotia which apparently operates in Haiti. Moreover, the two banks are offering participation in some kind of concession which they have, or hope to obtain, involving mineral rights throughout Haiti. Burris (and Oakley) are not overly impressed that this consists of more than the usual promotional effort.

1. Clonard Joseph Charles vas rearvested at 1600 hours 11 May 68. His present whereabouts are not known to no.

2. It became clear, during the period between 3 May 68 and 16 May 68 that Charles vould not be able to raise the renson sum of 03$605 thousand. His release from prison, which took place on 25 Apr 68, vas apparently contingent on his ability to produce that sun.. *Collector's Note:* See 00-8-321/14068-68.7. Immediately fol-loving his release, Charice attempted to interest foreign investors in subscribing to a fund of US$605 thousand. This sum was to be placed in a reorganised Banque Commerciale d'Eaisi, formerly Charles' private preserve, and used to pay off depositors and to stimulate investment in Haitian enterprises. Charles soon learned, however, that the present political and particular-ly the present economic oonditions in Haiti vere such as to discourage foreign investore from risking their money thare. Boboty would invest US dollars. Nobody wants gourds. Bobody is interested in investing in bankrupt country. Even Charles' reported willingness to pledge as collateral his extensive hold-ings in Baiti (essentie: oils and various other business enter-Erises, land, buildings and itian government bonds) failed to change the negative opinions of those approached as possible Investors.

3. Charles holds a receipt from the Banque Nationale de la Repub-lique d'Eniti (EMRH) in the amount of US$300 thousand dated 1956, and claims from the MAH another personal credit of US$100 thousand, dated 1965. He does not, however, hold a copy of any receipt for the latter sum. Charles apparently cannot utilize these sums, or his credit for them, to pay off the US$605 thousand ransom.

4. Charles' current visible cash assets consist of 18$100 thousand, deposited in the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and the First Fational City Bank, both of New York City. He originally had US$110 thousand in these two banks. When he was firet

When the Haitian authorities next presented filled-in checks, however, the bank refused payment, because it knew of his arrest and refused to believe that he had signed a check after his arrest. The Haitian authorities then abandoned their attempts to lay their hands on the rest of the money.

5. It is possible that President Duvalier might settle with Charles for the US$100 thousand on deposit in New York, when, as-and if he finally realises that Charles is not able to raise the original US$605 thousand embezzled. On the other hand, it is entirely possible that Charles has other funds secretly deposited outside of Haiti. It must be recalled that he acted for some time as courier for President Duvalier, periodically took money for the President to Switzerland and deposited it there for him. Charles may therefore have utilised the opportunity to deposit some of his own money outside of Haiti.

6. If Charles did in fact deposit money of his own in Switzerland or some other locality outside of Haiti, President Duvalier may know or suspect that he has done so. He definitely does know about Charles' US$100 thousand in New York. Accordingly, Charles' 11 May 68 rearrest may be the preliminary to renewed pressure to induce Charles to part with his New York money and/or the funds which he may have secreted elsewhere outside of Haiti.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen of Haitian birth. Source maintains close contacts with Haitians in the US and with prominent business and political figures in Haiti and travels at irregular intervals to the Caribbean countries.

1.  Clemard Joseph-Charles was released from prison during the evening of 25 Apr 68 in return for a "ransom" of US $605 thousand.

2.  Charles has been given until 24 May 68 to produce the US $605 thousand. This sum must be in an irrevocable letter of credit on an American bank in favor of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti. It has been intimated that the 24 May 68 deadline can be extended, should Charles be experiencing any really unusual difficulties in producing the required money.

3.  In order to obtain his release from prison, Charles had to sign a memorandum of understanding that he would produce the US $605 thousand plus some unidentified real property. These terms were agreed to by both Charles and his wife prior to the release. At the same time, Charles wrote a personal letter to President Duvalier asking for release and promising to hand over the money and property in question.

4.  Charles is now under house arrest in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

5.  Charles's immediate resources consist of about US $100 thousand in cash in two US banks (no additional data available), various homes, businesses (essential oils, an automobile dealership and others (no additional data avail-able)), buildings, land and about US $400 thousand worth of Haitian government bonds. He did have another US $300 thousand in personal funds in Haiti. He can no longer count on this money to help raise the US $605 thousand, however, because prior to his release from prison the Haitian authorities (no addi-tional data available) confiscated it.

6.  Charles has agreed to raise the US $605 thousand on condition that it be used to pay off legitimate claims of depositors in his Banque Commerciale d'Haiti. He has stated that he will permit the money to be paid out only to those depositors who are able to produce documentary proof that they had deposited funds in his bank.

7. Charles and several associates now propose to reorganize the Banque Commerciale d’Haiti, formerly his private preserve, into a corporate entity and to incorporate it in the US. The associates plan to raise US $500 thousand for this new corporation. This sum will be separate from the US $605 thousand and will serve to put the new banking corporation into business. Secretarial help and at least some of the six directors of the corporation will be US citizens. Two of the directors will be Charles himself and Louis Lovego.

8. President Duvalier is reportedly most interested in the new venture and is anxious to see it succeed. He has finally realized that the economic situation in Haiti has deteriorated so badly during the past 18 months that he must do something before total bankruptcy occurs. Accordingly, President Duvalier wants to improve his “image” in the eyes of the outside world, particularly in the US, and by doing so hopes to attract investments and business activities from outside Haiti. He apparently hopes that the new, incorporated, Banque Commerciale d’Haiti, will help attract such activity to Haiti and is therefore permitting Charles to proceed.

9. Collector’s Note: 00-B-321/14106-68 described a possible reorganization in the Haitian government. This reorganization, sponsored by Duvalier, would place Duvalier on the elevated plane of spiritual adviser and father of the people and would, on the surface, at least, turn over to a president the day-to-day management of Haitian government affairs. Various names have been mentioned for the position of president under the possible new system. The name of Luc-Albert Fouchard has recently been mentioned frequently in Haiti as the possible new president under the rumored reorganization of the government. Fouchard is a son-in-law of Duvalier and lives in Haiti. He is in charge of tourism. Some say that Duvalier listens to Fouchard and is, to a degree, influenced by him. I doubt this very strongly.

SOURCE Naturalised US citizen of Haitian birth. Source maintains close contacts with Haitians in the US and with prominent business and political figures in Haiti and travels at irregular intervals to the Caribbean countries.

1.  Clemark Joseph-Charles was relessed from prison during the evening of 25 Aper 68 in return for a "reason" of US $605 thousand.

2.  Charlee has been given until 24 Kay 68 to produce the US $605 thousand. This sun must to in an irrevocable letter of credit on an American bank in favor of the National Bank of the Republic of Baiti. It has been intimated that the 24 Kay 68 deadline can be extended, should Charles be experiencing any really unusual difficulties in producing the required monzy.

3.  In order to obtain his release from prison, Charles had to sign a screndum of understanding that he would produce the US $605 thousand plus sone unidentified real property. These terms vare agreed to by both Charles and his wife prior to the release. At the same tims, Charles wrote a personal letter to President Duvalier saking for release and promising to hand over the mousy and property in question.

4.  Charice is now under house arrest in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

5.  Charles's immediate rescurces consist of about US $100 thousand in sach in two US banks (no additional data available), various homes, businesses (essential oils, an cutomobile dealership and others (no additional dete mail-able)), buildings, lend and about us $400 thousand worth of linition government bonds. De did have another US $300 thousand in perwal funds in Haiti. Ha esa no longer count on this monay to help raise the US 4605 thousand, however, because prior to his reicase from prison the Haitian suthorities (no ait-tional data available) confiscated it.

7. Charles and several associates now propose to reorganise the Basque Commerciale d'Haiti, formerly his private preserve, into a corporate entity and to incorporate it in the US. The associates plan to raise US $500 thousand for this new corporation. This sum will be seperate from the US $605 thousand and vill serve to put the new banking corporation into business. Secretarial help and at least some of the six directors of the corporation vill be US citizens. Two of the directors will be Charles himself and Louis Leveque.

8. President Duvalier is reportedly most interested in the new venture and is anxious to see it succeed. He has finally realised that the economic situation in Haiti has deteriorated so badly during the past 18 months that he must do something before total bankruptcy occure. Accordingly, President Duvalier wants to ingrove his "image" in the eyes of the outside world, particularly in the UB, and by doing so hopes to attract investments and business activities from cat- side Raiti. Ha apparently hopes that the new, incorporated, Banque Commerciale d'Haiti, will Laip attract such activity to Haiti and is therefore permitting Charles to proceed.

9. Collector's Note: 00-8-321/12106-68 described a possible reorganisation in Ehe Haitian government. This reorganization, sponsored by Davalier, would place Duvalier on the elevated plans of spiritual adviser and father of the people and vould, on the surance, at least, turn over to a president the day- to-day Kamagammat of Eattian goverment affairs. Various nams have been montioned for the position of president wier the pocaibis now system. The mosa of Ias-Albert Fossard has recently been mentioned frequently in Eaiti as the possible now president under the rumored reorganisation of the gover. Foucard is a con-in-law of Duvalier and lives in Haiti. Ee is in charge of tourica. Some say that Davalier listens to Foucard and is, to a degree, influenced by hin. I doubt this very strongly.

PLACE AND DATE ACQUIRED: --- 30 APRIL 1968

THIS IS MY REPORT NO. 00-A(S) 1316365

SOURCE DESCRIPTION: NATURALIZED US CITIZEN OF HAITIAN BIRTH. SOURCE MAINTAINS CLOSE CONTACTS WITH HAITIANS IN THE US AND WITH PROMINENT BUSINESS AND POLITICAL FIGURES IN HAITI AND TRAVELS AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS TO THE CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES.

1. CLEVARD JOSEPH-CHARLES WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON ON THE EVENING OF 25 APRIL 1968 AND PROCEEDED TO HIS RESIDENCE. OUR SOURCE TELLS US THAT CHARLES IS BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MORALLY WELL AND IS NOW MAKING PREPARATIONS TO RETURN TO WORK.

2. OUR SOURCE HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY CHARLES, THROUGH A PARTY, EDMOND VILAIRE, PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI, TO TRAVEL TO HAITI AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE CHARLES WANTS TO TALK TO HIM. CHARLES HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO AGREE TO TAKE OUT A LETTER OF CREDIT IN FAVOR OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI IN THE AMOUNT OF US$605,000. THIS LETTER IS TO REMAIN VALID FOR 30 DAYS FROM THE TIME IT IS TAKEN OUT. CHARLES HAS BEEN GIVEN A SHORT TIME (NOT SPECIFIED) TO PRODUCE THE MONEY AND THE LETTER OF CREDIT.

3. MADAME CHARLES COMMITTED HER HUSBAND TO THE FOREGOING COURSE OF ACTION. FOLLOWING HER OWN RELEASE FROM PRISON, SHE WAS VISITED BY AN UNKNOWN (TO OUR SOURCE) PARTY. THIS INDIVIDUAL SET FORTH THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CHARLES WOULD BE RELEASED. THE CONDITIONS INCLUDED THE US$605,000 MENTIONED ABOVE. MADAME CHARLES ACCEPTED THE CONDITIONS AND SIGNED A PAPER TO THAT EFFECT. HER SIGNATURE COMMITTED HER HUSBAND.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 87

3. CE SOUCE BELIEVES THAT WHAT CHARLES WANTS HIM TO DO IS TO TAKE THE MONEY FROM WHEREVER CHARLES HAS IT (THE SOURCE PROFESSES NOT TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY NOW IS) AND DELIVERS IT TO HAITI.

5. THE SOURCE PLANS TO FLY TO PORT-AU-PRINCE ON EITHER 2 MAY 1968 OR 3 MAY 1968 AND TO RETURN TO NEW YORK ON 6 MAY 1968. THIS SCHEDULE IS, OF COURSE, SUBJECT TO CHANGE, DEPENDING UPON THE LOCATION OF CHARLES'S MONEY AND DEPENDING UPON WHETHER OR NOT SOURCE IS CORRECT IN HIS SURMISE THAT CHARLES WANTS HIM TO ACT AS COURIER.

6. SOURCE REQUESTED US TO NOTIFY THE US EMBASSY IN HAITI THAT HE WILL BE IN THE COUNTRY. HE WISHES THE EMBASSY TO BE NOTIFIED AS A PRECAUTION. SOURCE IS A NATURALIZED US CITIZEN OF HAITIAN BIRTH AND DOES NOT FEAR THAT ANYTHING UNTOWARD WILL HAPPEN TO HIM. HE FEELS THIS WAY NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HIS US CITIZENSHIP BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE REASONS THAT THE HAITIANS WILL NOT HARM THE US. HE IS, HOWEVER, MOST ANXIOUS THAT THE MONEY SHOW THAT HE WILL BE IN HAITI. SOURCE IS VERY PROUD OF HIS US CITIZENSHIP AND SWORE THAT HE WILL DO NOTHING TO JEOPARDIZE IT OR OTHERWISE GET HIMSELF IN TROUBLE.

SOURCE SUGGESTED STRONGLY TO HIM THAT AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES PORT-AU-PRINCE HE VISIT THE EMBASSY AND LET THE PEOPLE THERE KNOW THAT HE IS IN HAITI. WE ALSO TOLD HIM TO TELL THE EMBASSY PEOPLE HIS DATE OF DEPARTURE AND TO CHECK IN WITH THE EMPASSY JUST PRIOR TO DEPARTURE. SOURCE AGREED TO DO THIS.

7. WE UNDERSTAND THAT KENNETH RIPLEY, DDP, IS AU COURANT OF THIS ENTIRE AFFAIR. ARRED, PLEASE HAVE HIM NOTIFY THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS IN HAITI THAT SOURCE WILL BE THERE DURING THE TIMES MENTIONED ABOVE.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Clemard Joseph-Charles - Plans for Payment of Ranson

1. Mr. George Musulin (DCS) called today to give WH/7/Haiti advance notice of a report his office has received relative to the release from prison of Clemard Joseph-Charles.

2. Louis BRUN, who is the business representative of CHARLES in New York, has been urgently requested to come to Port au Prince. The request came to BRUN from one Edmond VILAIRE who, BRUN asserts, represents CHARLES in Haiti. BRUN plans to leave New York on 2 or 3 May and return on 6 May.

3. According to BRUN, CHARLES has agreed to pay $605,000 to the Duvalier Government for his release from prison. BRUN claims not to know where the money is located but suspects that it may be in Europe. He further suspects that he will be asked to act as courier.

4. BRUN, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, has some qualms about his own safety in Port au Prince and has asked his DCS contact in New York, Mr. Mitchell, that the Embassy in Port au Prince be advised of his arrival. He was told that he should go to the Embassy himself upon arrival and make his position known.

5. Mr. Musulin said he assumed WH/7/Haiti would pass the information to the State Department.

Subject: Case 47,540-Reported Relationship Between Haitian
Banker Clemard Joseph Charles and Colonel Max Dominique,
Son-in-Law of Haitian President Duvalier

1. On 6 October 1967, Louis A. Brun, President, B & B
   International Corporation, 1182 Broadway, New York City, stated
   that Haitian banker Clemard Joseph Charles has, in fact, con-
   trary to previous information, been in contact with Colonel
   Max Dominique, son-in-law of Haitian President Duvalier. While
   Brun was not able to supply any details concerning this rela-
   tionship, he believes that it is political in nature and
   possibly not unrelated to the various stories now circulating
   concerning plots to unseat the President.

2. Brun also stated that Dominique is scheduled to arrive
   in New York City for a visit in the near future (no additional
   details available).

**CONFIDENTIAL**

Dear Miss Matlack:

May I recall the kind reception you gave me in May 1965, when I was in Washington, also your courtesy in recomnending me the Alban Towers Hotel, 3700 Massachusetts Avenue, whore I lodged in Room 522. You will remember the conversation I had with you regarding the future of my country, and the hope I expressed that the assistance of the U. S. would not fail us.

I have earnestly worked since in order that Haiti may be relieved from the tyranny and misery in which has been inconsideratoly thrown, and have succeeded in securing the sympathy and support of a great majority of the populations all over the Republic, including religious poopic, businessmen, professionals, intellectuals, eto. A plan has been prepared and will be executed by a Nilitary man who has with him most of the officers in the Army. These people are ready and eager to begin operations and are only avaiting word from mo.

I would have already given them order to strike, through the Chief who is the only one in contact with me, were it not ror my approhono- ion that the turmoil that will necessarily follow might serve Castro's plan to introduce communist agitators in the country. I also have reason to wonder about Balaguer's position on account of his friendly feelings for Duvalier. Therefore, before going any further, I feel that it would be wise for me to have the U.S. assurance that these two forous will be properly neutralized, and I am requesting your kind cooperation so that this assurance may be given to me.

The following is sy humble appraisal of the political situation now prevailing in Haiti.

As 1 repeatcily stated to anyone who may have asked we, my motivations are purely patriotic while I am also moved by a sincere decire to see initi emerge as a democratic independent nation friendly to the United States.

Since I left Haiti with my family ten years ago to later become en Ameen citizen, I have made suveral trips to Haiti and have maintained close contacts with people in all walks of life both in Haiti and with those who were forced out of the country for political reasons or otherwise.

My latest visit to Haiti took place on June 5th of this year and I staved two days in Port-au-Prince. Although the purpose of my trips were mostly business I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian political situation with politicians, as well as with average Haitian citizens concerned with the situation. My personal conclusions are as fülows:

The fact is that the Duvalier regima is, at present, in a state of Internal political confusion in which no one directly or indirectly.con-nected with it can predict the outcome. There is strong evidence showing that his son-in-law, Colonel Max Dominique, has in fact tried to overthrow Duvalier in order to personally assume the direction of Haiti's political affairs. How Duvalier became aware of Colonel Dominique's intentions is the question everybody is trying to find the answer to. Nevertheless, Duvalier rounded up the allodged associates of Colonel Dominique and, after a wock cour: martial accusing and convincing 19 young army efticors of treason they were all killed by a firing squad on Juno 8, 1967 at Fort Dimanche on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. Duvalior himself yas present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique to be a member of the firing squad. Non-confirmed information from usually rollable sources


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

indicates that coveral other persons, low raming military personnel, militia men and civilians were also executed or similar charges, without fanfare. It is also the general concensus of opinion that the "purge" will continue at a rate that no one can yet determine.

No one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings between two groups within the President's family and close associates. Onc is headed by Colonel Dominique and his wife Marie-Denise Duvalier, and another is led by Mrs. Yvon St. Victor, the President's private secretary and confidante. The names of the President's wife, Simone, his son Jean-Claude and his younger daughter Simone, are being mentioned as being part of the first group. In the second group, Mrs. St.Victor's brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Mr. Luc-Albert Foucard, who is also married to one of the President's daughter, is among other names such as Henri Siclait, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert Jn.Pierre, etc. montioned to be siding with Mrs. St. Victor. So far, the President has shown signs that he favers the latter group. The ramifications of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fanatic supporters of Duvalier himself. The fact is that none of the remaining so-called strong men of Duvalier in the militia, the Tonton Macoutes or the Army know for sure how the president feels towards them and are very much concerned about their own future and survival. In other words, confusion and insecurity are wide spread amongst Duvalier's followers.

I believe that in spite of the actual confusion and sense of insecurity prevailing in government circles, there is no real organized opposition as such against Duvalier at this moment, except for what I will point out later in this paper..

There is, however, strong anti-luvalier feelings in the middle and upper classes of Haiti, representing only a small percentage of the whole population. A segment of the population to be taken into very serious consideration is the one made up of the people living in the slum áreas,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

both within and on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. These people to be differentiated with the rural peasants, live in abjeet poverty with no established means of subsistance, and represent the most volatile and dangerous political force to be watched closely in the event of any significant development of the political and social situation. These people which foraca, in 1956 and 1957, the core of former president Daniel Fignole's followers, can be swung to any movement and play a accisive cole in the confusion that may arise in the event of a coup. We are convinced that these people will welcome a change should any dezagogue lead them to believe that they will benefit by such a change.

I an informed that in Port-au-Prince there are some political personalities, in and out of the Government, that are waiting for an opportunity to swing that sector in their favor, whenever a serious attempt to overthrow Duvalier is made, whether by then or anyone clse. Under those circumstances, Duvalier loosing his old grip on key elements committed to his support, a large portion of which he has recently liquidated, is trying to instore a new political philosophy reaching out for elements of the middle class a. well as those of the slum areas mentioned above. I have a feeling that the new philosophy is aimed at antagonizing the U.S. Government for its hands-off policies and the economic squeeze applied by the U.S. against his government. This antagonism will go as far as necessary even to an almost impossible alliance with communist countries such as Cuba or other communist nations of Europe, Africa or Asia. As evidence of that direction in Duvalier's Government, he has allowed the so-called "Little Red Book" of Chairman Mao-Tse-Tung of Communist China to circulate freely in Haiti, whereas previously the sure took was banned and seized in local librairies and newsstands in Haiti. Several articles appearing in local Haitian newspapers have lately referred with much emphasis to the "Cultural Revolution" of Duvalier which has yet to take place. The appointment in his newly formed cabinet of three Blanchet brothers, all well-known communist sympathisors, is alse an indication of his subtle shift towarde a


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

radically leftist oriented Government. If allowed time, Divalier zay
weil succeed to turn the country into a new communist satellite and work
out some agreements with communist countries. Here again, we should not
fail to mention the new exchange of diplomatic representations between
Haiti end some communist countries. The most significant one is the new
appointment in Haiti of an Ambassador from Poland with whoa, I was told,
Duvalier is closely working with.

Taking everything into consideration:
1. The non existence of any organized opposition in Kalci;
2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust amongst the exiled
   political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action from
   outside Haiti;
3. The fear of local politicians that, if outside torces were to come
   in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they
   should resist such intervention and do whatever is necessary to prevent
   it at all cost;
4. The fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated
   upon mere suspicion, just or unjust denonciations;
5. The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.S. is not working
   as it should to bring about the downfall of Duvalier and that the U.S. 18.
   even supporting the regime intentionally or unintentionally by not en-
   couraging or allowing the opposition to organize itself;
6. The interpretation of the above classes which are at a loss to under
   stand the silence of the U.S. press in general for not having raised the
   usual indignation about the recent mass killings, therefore making room
   for the belief of a possible collusion by means of money or otherwise of
   Duvalier with said press, particularly the New York Times, to rerrain from
   bringing these facts to the attention of international public opinion;
7. The strong belief that compromises have been worked out with President
   Balaguer in the Dominican Republic to return to Haiti all opponents of -
   Duvalier who had fled there,
   all this leads to believe tt Duvalier will hold in power for quite a wazie
   more.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear logical enough to confirm these conclusions.

I an convenced in my own mind, that when some politicians close to Duvalier will feel that their lives are in real danger, some of them will successfully attempt to eliminate him even though they may not be, themselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that will necessarily follow. This is where the real danger is. If any such un-planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself with a real "hot potato", requiring such drastic action similar to those takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominican Republic. Such actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the American taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong anti-American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice and decisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is to wait for the OAS to decide on joint action in the cventuality of chaos, we are afraid that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces based in Cuba and other countries, will make it much more difficult to cope with within the context of our national security. It is, therefore, imperative, in our opinion, that the U.S. take some steps towards working with local politicians to take the initiative of a coup which, when per-formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily, financially and otherwise, to secure an orderly succession of the present regime. As far as lHaiti is concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the security of this nation or any nation is concerned, there is no time for wait-and-sее considerations. In the case of Haiti, in particular, where the political scene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictions, one way or the other, we feel that the U.S. should not have any problem in finding someone that they can build politically and work with in a sincere and loyal effort to help that small nation rolve some of its perennial problems.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

-6-

In connection with the possibility of finding a political leader, as indicated above, I must say that I have been in contact with a man whom, I feel, could very well fill the position. His name is Clémard Joseph Charles, President of Ba. e Commerciale d'Haiti, President of Haiti's Chamber of Commerce, a director of several other business and industrial organizations in Haiti.

I have known Mr. Charles since 1951. We have been friends and business associates eversince. To me, Mr. Charles is a true and sincere patriot. Of course, today, a number of people question his patriotism on the basis of his close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have myself, sometimes, felt that he went too far. I have also told him so, many times. His-answers on such occasions have, most of the time, satisfy my own judgement. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvalier, as he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if he were to behave in a different manner. What would his death serve if he had taken a position of non-compromise? He feels that in order to be able to control the situation and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be "in" than "out" or to put it another way to be alive than dead. I can say that on several occasions, was it not for Mr. Charles' influence on Duvalier, this latter would have done more harm to the poor pelple of Haiti, in general, than he has done so far.

I have always maintained a dialogue with Mr. Charles and passed on to him as much as possible the judgements of Haitians and others with whom he had no direct contact. I must say that I have always find him re-ceptive to their opinions.

Eversince I have knowı Mr. Charles, he has always told me of his ambitions and determination to be a great Haitian. He asked me to never let him down and to stay with him to help him carry out his dream. Though it has cost me some of my friende, I have extended to him everything that I could possibly offer to help him reach his goals.

Unlike the majority of Illaitien politicians, Mr. Charles has an un-surmontable faith in the future of his country. He feels that if Haiti, under Duvalier, has considerably regressed in every way, the time will come

/...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

-7-

where, like a miracle, the country will again take its course forward to join the other progressive nations of this hemisphere. Unlike those politicians who have seen their prominent positions as a temporaty state of affairs with absolutely no future beyond Duvalier, Mr. Charles has práctically invested in Haiti almost all the wealth that he has accumulated before and during Duvalier's reign through genuine efforts and self-discipline. Of course, I will admit that his wealth would not have increased in its present proportion if it was not for Duvalier's favors to him. Liut who else under the previous regimes who were in the same position have genuinely directed their efforts in using their gains for the betterment of the people? I have always find that Mr. Charles took very much satisfaction in giving employment and assistance to as many people as he possibly could. As a matter of fact this is one of his biggest assets in his present struggle.

Mr. Charles is not a demagogue. He believes in the realities of the modern world. He realizes that without the assistance of the U.S., progress is impossible for Haiti. He sincerely believes in the spirit of the Alliance for Progress. Having traveled extensively, he is fully aware of the tragic state of stagnation in which his country is in. He deeply wishes to see Haiti make some progress in the fields of human dignity, education, technology and above all, Freedom.

All that I have said so far are my own personal opinion and also the opinion of a large number of people in and out of Haiti. If some defer in their evaluation of Mr. Charles, it is their privilege and undeniable rights.

Now, if we are to take for granted my opinions, what does Mr. Charles have to offer to the U.S. to prevent the chaos that will necessarily follow Duvalier's downfall? First of all, Mr. Charles is at present ready and willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's regime. This, he assured me, he can do without any outside assistance. I am personally aware of certain confidential dispositions taken by him to ascure the success of a coup if and when he decides to make it. Why does

/...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

not he go ahead and make it, you may ask? His reply is that should he make it, what assurances does he have that his action will satisfy the U.S. is I stated before, Mr. Charles feels that without United States backing, no government can possibly exist in Haiti except under the very same conditions of Duvalier's Government. There would be no reason to precipitate a change if Haiti were to remain under a tyranical dictatorship like Duvalier's.

What Mr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite of any action to be sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance from a person of establishei authority in the U.S. Government that the United States will support the provisional government that will necessarily have to assure power after Duvalier.

The dispositions taken by Mr. Charles are that a military coup by a Junta will take over and stay in power until free elections are held. The members of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles, who has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles believe that if free elections are held he should not have any great difficulty in selling his plans and programs to the people and therefore be elected the next president of Haiti. In my opinion, Mr. Charles is not asking too much. Should the United States consent to his request in the form mentioned above, I feel that the Haitian situation, long a sore note in the U.S. hemispheric relations, could be changed without risk for all parties concerned.

Why should the United States gamble on any other calculated risk, while I feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Charles' plans? The military junta proposed by Mr. Charles will be made up by high ranking officers of the Haitian army loyal to him, therefore on the side of the U.S. With U.S. assistance it is almost impossible otherwise the steps proposed by Mr. Charles after the junta will take over are as follows:

1. Disarm the Militia and the Tonton Macoutes immediately;
2. Reorganize the Army and the Covernment services;
3. Prevent the interference of communist forces made of exiles Haitiane based in Cuba or elsewhere;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 112

1. Prevent the return to the Haitian political scene of such "rabble-rouser" so-called leaders as Daniel Fignole and Henri Vixamar;

2. Start the ground work for free elections as soon as possible.

Mr. Charles feels that although it will probably be impossible to prevent acts of reprisals during the first 72 hours of the military take over, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

Mr. Charles, in my opinion, is one of the few individuals around whom a reconciliation of all the social divisions and subdivisions of the Haitian family can be achieved. I will mention some of the basic reasons behind this opinion:

1. He is of modest rural extraction, therefore is what is called in Haiti a "son of the masses";

2. He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the Haitian people who, at this point, considers the light-skin Haitian as a threat for the return of the domination of the mulatto minority;

3. He is deprived of the prejudice of color, therefore the mulatto minority will find in him a certain feeling of security and can be assured that it will not be persecuted solely on the basis of the color of their skins;

4. He is wealthy, therefore credited for not ambitioning power for mere personal gains;

5. He is known to be a hard, intelligent industrialist and administrator capable of promoting and encouraging the establishment of new business and industries in Haiti;

6. He has shown respect for certain moral values such as the undeniable right of the individual to live without fear within the framework of the laws of the land;

7. He is a Roman Catholic who professes to have nothing to do with "Voodoo" as a religion or a cult and who has given all the other religious denominations functioning in Haiti all the evidence of his encouragement and support for their pastoral activities;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

8. Being a businessman in his own right, the business community with which he has dealt through the Chamber of Commerce and his bank will always have a dialogue with him and therefore will find him receptive to their suggestions and endeavours;

9. Having dealt with elements of the actual rezine who invo his confidence, he will be able to control them in a way which will avoid unnecessary hardships should someone else - a complete stranger to then - be in a position of Government leadership;

10. He is known to be strongly anti-communist and pro-American, therefore opening the door to close cooperation with the United States, under the doctrine of the Alliance for Progress, to promote better understanding and opportunities for the Haitian people with the help of the United States;

11. He will welcome the return of all Haitian exiles to take their place anew within the Haitian community and to work with him to the task of making the country a safer and better place to live;

12. He does not contemplate any reprisals or even sanctions against anybody for their past political affiliations, his efforts to be mainly Girected not to solve the errors of the past, but to provide a better present and future for those who want to live in Haiti.

The task, if and when he succeeds to gain power, will not be an easy cnc. I am sure, however, that Mr. Charles will be able to find the support of enough honest and patriotic Haitians to help him carry out his dream of building up a better Faiti.

Mr. Charles' past affiliation with the Duvalier regime should not, therefore, be held against him. As a matter of fact, this affiliation may give him the foresight that he should do his utmost not to repeat the same mistakes.

In conclusion, I feel that the U.S. Government, through its qualified Agencies, should give Mr. Charles' offer to toppie the Duvalier regime, all the required careful consideration and make a decision as fast as possible.

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

ARA/CAR - Edward T. Long

SECRET
LIMDIS

## Plot of Clemard Charles to Overthrow Duvalier

June 29, 1957
3:30 p.m.

At the suggestion of Mr. Bowdler, Howard L. Burris,
1725 K St., N.W., a Washington businessman who served in
the past as an assistant military aide to the President,
telephoned this morning and asked me to meet Mr. Louis A.
Brun at Mr. Burris' office. This I did this afternoon.

Mr. Brun, a nationalized American, owns and operates
the B & B International Corporation, 1182 Broadway, New
York. A native-born Haitian, he has lived in the States
since 1957. He is a close friend and confidant of Clemard
Joseph Charles, a Haitian banker who has been deeply involved
with the Duvalier government. Charles has fallen in dis favor
with Duvalier and several of his government concessions have
been cancelled. Charles is actively plotting the overthrow
of Duvalier and, according to Brun who saw Charles in
Port au Prince June 5-7, has 167 military and civilians ready
to move with him. None of this group was represented by the
19 officers who were recently executed or the 80 some Haitians
who are currently in diplomatic asylum.

In the past, Charles has made efforts himself and
through Brun to get the U.S. Government to commit itself in
favor of the overthrow of Duvalier but until recently all
of these approaches were rebuffed, U.S. officials having
stated U.S. policy was such that no plot of this nature could
be supported. Brun showed me a letter he had just received
from Charles written on June 23 stating in a commercial language code which Brun and Charles use in their correspondence
that an American official last week had met with Charles in
Fort-au-Prince and that Charles was most pleased with the
"positive" meeting. The implication was that this "American" had
indicated to Charles that the U.S. Government favored the
plotting. I flatly told Brun that the U.S. was not interested

in supporting plotting of this nature, that our policy had not changed, and that he should know this categorically. Brun smilingly accepted this statement, but obviously considered the "approach" in Port-au-Prince was more important than wy exposition of U.S. policy.

Brun said he was in regular contact with Major James Balog who, the described, as an intelligence officer from the Pentagon. He said that he, Brun, had written a report on his opinion re things Haitian and had given one copy to Major Balog and one to Mr. Burris. He then handed me a copy which is attached. This report is basically a plea for U.S. prior indication to Charles that the U.S. would support any Charles-formed provisional government created following the overthrow of Duvalier.

I closed the half hour meeting with Brun insisting again that he should clearly understand the U.S. Government was not interested in becoming involved in this sort of an operation.

ACQ 26 JUNE 1967, PORT AU PRINCE, HAITI, HTP-1072

SOURCE A FORMER HAITIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE WHO HAS THE CONFIDENCE OF MANY MEMBERS OF THE DUVALIER GOVERNMENT. HIS REPORTING HAS BEEN ACCURATE SINCE 1963. HE RECEIVED THE INFORMATION FROM A HIGH RANKING OFFICER IN THE HAITIAN ARMED FORCES WHO IS CLOSE TO GENERAL CONSTANT.

1. THE REASONS FOR PRESIDENT FRANCOIS DUVALIER'S MEASURES AGAINST CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK ARE NOT HARD TO FIND. DUVALIER HAS

LEARNED THE LESSONS OF HAITIAN HISTORY. PRESIDENT ESTIME
AND PRESIDENT PAUL MAGLOIRE WERE OVETHROWN BY THEIR
CLOSE ASSOCIATES. DUVALIER HIMSELF WAS IN THE
FOREFRONT OF THOSE CONSPIRACIES AND KNOWS FROM
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THE MOTIVATION OF THE PLOTTERS.
WHEN HE GETS RID OF MILITARY MEN OR CIVILIANS FROM
TIME TO TIME EVEN THOUGH THEY HELPED HIM GAIN POWER,
IT IS BECAUSE AS CHIEF OF STATE HE IS FULLY AWARE OF
THE REALITIES OF HAITIAN POLITICS. CLEMARD JOSEPH
CHARLES, WHO GAINED MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS UNDER MAGLOIRE,
WAS AMONG THOSE WHO FINANCED DUVALIER'S CAMPAIGN.
IT IS ONLY LOGICAL THAT DUVALIER WOULD RESENT THAT
FACT. FURTHERMORE, SINCE CHARLES IS ACTUALLY A
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND MANEUVERING
AGAINST DUVALIER, DUVALIER WILL DISCOVER SOME "EVIDENCE"
LINKING CHARLES WITH THE NINETEEN EXECUTED OFFICERS.

2. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT CHARLES WAS NOT REALLY
   AN ASSOCIATE OF DUVALIER'S. HE WAS REALLY NOTHING
   MORE THAN AN EMPLOYEE. IT WAS NOT BECAUSE OF HIS
   PRETTY EYES THAT DUVALIER MADE CHARLES THE CONTROLLER

OF A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT MONOPOLIES. DUVALIER
ARRANGED THIS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES. HE NEEDED TO HAVE
A BANK TO RECEIVE NON-FISCAL DEPOSITS FROM WHICH HE
COULD MAKE WITHDRAWALS AS HE WISHED. OUT OF THIS ALSO
GREW ANOTHER REASON WHY DUVALIER IS ANGRY AT CHARLES.
WHEN THE NON-FISCAL ACCOUNTS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANK RAN
DRY, THE BANK ADVANCED THE GOVERNMENT MONEY AGAINST BONDS.
CHARLES USED THESE BONDS IN HIS FINANCIAL MANIPULATIONS
AND THEY FELL INTO THE HANDS OF FOREIGN SPECULATORS WHO
ARE NOW DEMANDING PAYMENT.

3. PLOTS SUCH AS CHARLES WAS ENGAGED IN WILL
   NOT SUCCEED. DUVALIER HAS SO ORGANIZED THE GOVERNMENT
   THAT THE OLD WAYS OF OVERTHROWING A REGIME ARE DENIED
   TO CONSPIRATORS. HE IS NOT INVULNERABLE BUT ONLY BY
   ASSASSINATION WILL HE BE REMOVED. HIS GOVERNMENT IS
   BASED ON TERROR AND INTIMIDATION. THE BOLD STROKE IS
   HIS STRENGTH. HE EXECUTED THE NINETEEN OFFICERS IN ORDER
   TO STRIKE THE POPULAR IMAGINATION AND CREATE A PSYCHOSIS
   OF FEAR. HE MEANS IT WHEN HE SAYS THAT HE ADMIRES LENIN,
   NKRUMAH, MAO, LUMUMBA, ETC. THE DANGER IN HIS

The following is my humble appraisal of the political situation now prevailing in Haiti.

As 1 repeatedly stated to anyone who may have asked me, my motivations are purely patriotic while I am also moved by a sincere desire to see Haiti emerge as a democratic independent nation friendly to the United States.

Since I left Haiti with my family ten years ago to later become an American citizen, I have made several trips to Haiti and have maintained close contacts with people in all walks of life both in Haiti and with those who were forced out of the country for political reasons or otherwise.

My latest visit to Haiti took place on June 5th of this year and I stayed two days in Port-au-Prince. Although the purpose of my trips were mostly business I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian political situation with politicians, as well as with average Haitian citizens concerned with the situation. My personal conclusions are as follows:

The fact is that the Duvalier regime is, at present, in a state of internal political confusion in which no one directly or indirectly connected with it can predict the outcome. There is strong evidence showing that his son-in-law, Colonel Max Dominique, has in fact tried to overthrow Duvalier in order to personally assume the direction of Haiti's political affairs. How Duvalier became aware of Colonel Dominique's intentions is the question everybody is trying to find the answer to. Nevertheless, Duvalier rounded up the alledged associates of Colonel Dominique and, after a mock court martial accusing and convincing 19 young army officers of treason they were all killed by a firing squad on June 8, 1967 at Fort Dimanche on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. Duvalier himself was present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique to be a member of the firing squad. Non-confirmed information from usually rollable sources

indicates that several other persons, low ranking military personnel,
militia men and civilians were also executed or similar charges, without
fanfare. It is also the general concensus of opinion that the "purge"
will continue at a rate that no one can yet determine.

No one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings
between two groups within the President's family and close associates.
One is headed by Colonel Dominique and his wife Marie-Denise Duvalier,
and another is led by Mrs. Yvon St.Victor, the President's private se-
cretary and confidante. The names of the President's wife, Simone, his
son Jean-Claude and his younger daughter Simone, are being mentioned as
being part of the first group. In the second group, Mrs. St.Victor's
brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Mr. Luc-Albert
Foucard, who is also married to one of the President's daughter, is among
other names such as Henri Siclait, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert
Jn.Pierre, etc. mentioned to be siding with Mrs. St Victor. So far, the
President has shown signs that he favors the latter group. The ramifica-
tions of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fanatic
supporters of Duvalier himself. The fact is that none of the remaining
so-called strong men of Duvalier in the militia, the Tonton Macoutes or
the Army know for sure how the president feels towards them and are very
much concerned about their own future and survival. In other words,
confusion and insecurity are wide spread amongst Duvalier's followers.
I believe that in spite of the actual confusion and sense of insecurity
prevailing in government circles, there is no real organized opposition
is such against Duvalier at this moment, except for what I will point out
later in this paper.

There is, however, strong anti-Duvalier feelings in the middle and
upper classes of Haiti, representing only a small percentage of the whole
population. A segment of the population to be taken into very serious
consideration is the one made up of the people living in the slum áreas,

sspathizers, is also un indication of te subtle chift coverce &

radically leftist oriented Government. If allowed time, Duvalier may well succeed to turn the country into a now communist satcllite and work out some agreements with communist countries. Here again, we should not fail to mention the new exchange of diplomatic representations between Haiti and some communist countries. The most significant one is the new appointment in Haiti of an Ambassador from Poland with whom, I was told, Duvalier is closely working with.
Taking everything into consideration:
1. The non existence of any organized opposition in Haiti;
2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust amongst the exiled political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action from outside Haiti;
3. The fear of local politicians that, if outside forces were to come in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they should resist such intervention and do whatever is necessary to prevent it at all cost;
4. The fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated upon mere suspicion, just or unjust denonciations;
5. The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.3. is not working as it should to bring about the downfall of Duvalier and that the U.S. is even supporting the regime intentionally or unintentionally by not encouraging or allowing the opposition to organize itself;
6. The interpretation of the above classes which are at a loss to understand the silence of the U.S. press in general for not having raised the usuel indignation about the recent mass killings, therefore making room for the belief of a possible collusion by means of money or otherwise of Duvalier with said press, particularly the New York Times, to refrain from bringing these facts to the attention of international public opinion;
7. The strong belief that compromises have been worked out with President Balaguer in the Dominican Republic to return to Haiti all opponents of Duvalier who had fled there,
   all this leads to believe t. Duvalier will hold in power for quite a while more.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 139

-5-

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear logical enough to confirm these conclusions.

I am convenced in my own mind, that when some politicians close to Duvalier will feel that their lives are in real danger, some of them will successfully attempt to eliminate him even though they may not be, themselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that will ne- cessarily follow. This is where the real danger is. If any such un- planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself with a real "hot potato", requiring such drastic action similar to those takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominican Republic. Such actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the American taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong anti- American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice and decisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is to wait for the OAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality of chaos, we are afraid that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces based in Cuba and other countries, will make it much more difficult to cope with within the context of our national security. It is, therefore, imperative, in our opinion, that the U.S. take some steps towards working with local politicians to take the initiative of a coup which, when per- formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily, financially and otherwise, to secure an orderly succession of the present regime. As far as Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the security of this nation or any nation is concerned, there is no time for wait-and-se considerations. In the case of Haiti, in particular, where the political. scene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictions, one way or the other, we feel that the U.S. should not have any problem in finding someone that they can build politically and work with in a sincere and loyal effort to help that small nation solve some of its perennial problems..


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 140

In connection with the possibility of finding a political leader, as indicated above, I must say that I have been in contact with a man whom, I feel, could very well fit the position. His name is Clémard Joseph Charles, President of Banque Commerciale d'Haiti, President of Haiti's Chamber of Commerce, a director of several other business and industrial organizations in Haiti.

I have known Mr. Charles since 1951. We have been friends and business associates eversince. To me, Mr. Charles is a true and sincere patriot. Of course, today, a number of people question his patriotism on the basis of his close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have myself, sometimes, felt that he went too far. I have also told him so, many times. His answers, on such occasions have, most of the time, satisfy my own judgement. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvalier, as he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if he were to behave in a different manner. What would his death serve if he had taken a position of non-compromise? He feels that in order to be able to control the situation and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be "in" than "out" or to put it another way to be alive than dead. I can say that on several occasions, was it not for Mr. Charles' influence on Duvalier, this latter would have done more harm to the poor people of Haiti, in general, than he has done so far.

I have always maintained a dialogue with Mr. Charles and passed on to him as much as possible the judgements of Haitians and others with whom he had no direct contact. I must say that I have always find him receptive to their opinions.

Eversince I have known Mr. Charles, he has always told me of his ambitions and determination to be a great Haitian. He asked me to never let him down and to stay with him to help him carry out his dream. Though it has cost me some of my friends, I have extended to him everything that I could possibly offer to help him reach his goals.

Unlike the majority of Haitian politicians, Mr. Charles has an unsurmontable faith in the future of his country. He feels that if Haiti, under Duvalier, has considerably regressed in every way, the time will come

/...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

-7-

where, like a miracle, the country will again take its course forward to join the other progressive nations of this hemisphere. Unlike those politicians who have seen their prominent positions as a temporaty state of affairs with absolutely no future beyond Duvalier, Mr. Charles has practically invested in Haiti almost all the wealth that he has accumulated before and during Duvalier's reign through genuine efforts and self-discipline. Of course, I will admit that his wealth would not have increased in its present proportion if it was not for Duvalier's favors to him. But who else under the previous regimes who were in the same position have genuinely directed their efforts in using their gains for the betterment of the people? I have always find that Mr. Charles took very much satisfaction in giving employment and assistance to as many people as he possibly could. As a matter of fact this is one of his biggest assets in his present struggle.

Mr. Charles is not a demagogue. He believes in the realities of the modern world. He realizes that without the assistance of the U.S., progress is impossible for Haiti. He sincerely believes in the spirit of the Alliance for Progress. Having traveled extensively, he is fully avare of the tragic state of stagnation in which his country is in. He deeply wishes to see Haiti make some progress in the fields of human dignity, education, technology and above all, Freedom.

All that I have said so far are my own personal opinion and also the opinion of a large number of people in and out of Haiti.. If some defer in their evaluction of Mr. Charles, it is their privilege and undeniable rights.

Now, if we are to take for granted my opinions, what does Mr. Charles have to offer to the U.S. to prevent the chaos that will necessarily follow Duvalier's downfall? First of all, Mr. Charles is at present ready and willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's regime. This, he assured me, he can do without any outside assistance. I am personally aware of certain confidential dispositions taken by him to assure the success of a coup if and when he decides to make it. Why does

2


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

- 8 -

not he go ahead and make it, you may ask? His reply is that should he make it, what assurances does he have that his action will satisfy the U.S. As I stated before, Mr. Charles feels that without United States backing, no government can possibly exist in Haiti except undor the very same conditions of Duvalier's Government. There would be no reason to precipitate a change if Haiti were to remain under a tyranical dictatorship like Duvalier's...

What Mr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite of any action to be sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance from a person of established authority in the U.S. Government that the United States will support the provisional government that will necessarily have to assure power after Duvalier.

The dispositions taken by Mr. Charles are that e military coup by a Junta will take over and stay in power until free elections are held. The members of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles, who has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles believe that if free elections are heid he should not have any great difficulty in selling his plans and programs to the people and therefore be elected the next president of Haiti. In my opinion, Mr. Charles is not asking too much. Should the United States consent to his request in the form mentioned above, I feel that the Haitian situation, long a sore note in the U.S. hamispheric relations, could be changed without risk for all parties concerned.

Why should the United States gamble on any other calculated risk, while I feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Charles' plans? The military junta proposed by Mr. Charles will be made up by high ranking officers of the Haitian army loyal to him, therefore on the side of the U.3. With U.S. assistance - it is almost impossible otherwise - the steps proposed by Mr. Charles after the Junta will take over are as follows:

1. Disarm the Militia and the Tonton Macoutes immediately)

2. Reorganise the Army and the Government services;

3. Prevent the interference of communist forces made of exilas Haitians based in Cuba or elsewhere)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 143

- 9 -

4. Provent the return to the Haitian political scone of such "rabble-rouser" so-called leaders as Daniel Fignole and Henri Vixamar;

5. Star. the ground work for free elections as soon as possible. Mr. Charles feels that although it will probably be impossible to prevent acts of reprisals during the first 72 hours of the military take over, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

Mr. Charles, in my opinion, is one of the few individuals around whom a reconciliation of all the social divisions and subdivisions of the Haitian family can be achieved. I will mention some of the basic reasons behind this opinion:

1.  He is of modest rural extraction, therefore is what is called in Haiti a "son of the masses";

2.  He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the Haitian people who, at this point, considers the light-skin Haitian as a threat for the return of the domination of the mulatto minority;

3.  He is deprived of the prejudice of color, therefore the mulatto minority will find in him a certain feeling of security and can be assured that it will not be persecuted solely on the basis of the color of their skins;

4.  He is wealthy, therefore credited for not ambitioning power for mere personal gains;

5.  He is known to be a hard, intelligent industrialist and administrator capable of promoting and encouraging the establishment of new business and industries in Haiti;

6.  He has shown respect for certain moral values such as the undeniable right of the individual to live without fear within the framework of the laws of the land;

7.  He is a Roman Catholic who professes to have nothing to do with "Voodoo" as a religion or a cult and who has given all the other religious denominations functioning in Haiti all the evidence of his encouragement and support for their pastoral activities;

/...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 144

- 10 -

8. Being a businessman in his own right, the business community with which he has dealt through the Chamber of Commerce and his bank will always have a dialogue with him and therefore will find him receptive to their suggestions and endeavours;

9. Having dealt with elements of the actual regime who have his confidence, he will be able to control them in a way which will avoid unnecessary hardships should someone else - a complete stranger to them - be in a position of Government leadership;

10. He is known to be strongly anti-communist and pro-American, therefore opening the door to close cooperation with the United States, under the doctrine of the Alliance for Progress, to promote better understanding and opportunities for the Haitian people with the help of the United States;

11. He will welcome the return of all Haitian exiles to take their place anew within the Haitian community and to work with him to the task of making the country a safer and better place to live;

12. He does not contemplate any reprisals or even sanctions against anybody for their past political affiliations, his efforte to be mainly directed not to solve the errors of the past, but to provide a better present and future for those who want to live in Haiti.

The task, if and when he succeeds to gain power, will not be an easy one. I am sure, however, that Mr. Charles will be able to find the support of enough honest and patriotic Haitians to help him carry out his dream of building up a better Haiti,

Mr. Charles' past affiliation with the Duvalier regime should not, therefore, be held against him. As a matter of fact, this affiliation may give him the foresight that he should do his utmost not to repeat the same mistakes.

In conclusion, I feel that the U.S. Government, through its qualified Agencies, should give Mr. Charles' offer to toppie the Duvalier regime, all the required careful consideration and make a decision as fast as possible.

Subject: Report from George Musulin

1. George Musulin, Washington DCS representatived, called this afternoon to advise the following:

a. Dorothy Matlack (Dept. of Army 0-2) has now been cut out of the contact between the DCS and Mr. B in New York. Presume that Mr. B refers to Luis Brun, the New York lawyer and representative of Clemard Joseph Charles.

b. Mr. C. (Clemard Joseph Charles) ms been placed under house arrest as of 21 June. He cannot leave the country. All of his properties and possessions have been taken from him. The only thing Chrles has left is his interest in the Commercial Bank. The situation in Haiti is believed to be deteriorating very rapidly. (Note: Musulin or Brun apparently have no explanation as to how Charles managed to retain his banking interest after having everything else stripped from hig.)

c. Two children of Max Dominique from his previous mariage arrived in New York last night by plane from Port au Prince..

d. Papa Doc is very concerned about the impression one gets from busineare interest in the city. Apparently the place takes looks like a ghost town after dark. Accordingly he has issued webwwwbiwwe orders that all stores stay open from. 8-12 an the morning and li-9 in the evening.

2. Will advise when more info available. Musulin believes that Duvalier placed Charles under arrest because he got wind of his proposed conspiracy. He does not know where the leak occurred.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Clemard Joseph CHARLES (201-357029)

1. Background: Clemard Joseph CHARLES, born Gonaives, Haiti, 21 April 1923, is a Negro of peasant origin. CHARLES is a shrewd, opportunistic, basically dishonest individual whose natural talents have been channelled to President DUVALIER's advantage over a period of ten years. Having made considerable money in the banana business, CHARLES was able, in 1960, to create the Commercial Bank of Haiti, of which he is still the sole owner. Since its beginning, the Bank has been an instrument for DUVALIER's financial manipulations, and CHARLES is a subservient agent for the President in many of the latter's clandestine operations conceived to evade U. S. Government surveillance. CHARLES, for example, was DUVALIER's agent in the operation designed to smuggle surplus U. S. military aircraft to Haiti and, in fact, made a trip to a USAF base in Arizona to effect purchase, which was later blocked. After long, close association with DUVALIER, during which CHARLES had become extremely wealthy, he managed to incur DUVALIER's displeasure. Gradually CHARLES' influence diminished in favor of Henri SICLAIT, Director of the Regie de Tabac. As CHARLES began to realize that he no longer enjoyed DUVALIER's favor, he began, for the second or third time, to seek channels to the U. S. Government and to solicit support for himself as a successor to the President.

2. Agency Contact: CIA contact with CHARLES in the U.S. dates back to May 1963 when he was visited in his suite in the Hotel Willard in Washington by a representative of WH Division. Since that time, he has made his every visit to the U.S. an occasion to talk to some official of the U. S. Government. The most persistent of his approaches has been made to DCS/New York, which he believes leads him to the Department of Defense. Never has this unscrupulous, overly-ambitious charlatan offered any evidence that he has anything going for him inside Haiti. The names he has furnished as his alleged collaborators have meant little or nothing. His approach to a Station representative in Port-au-Prince in January 1967 produced nothing in the way of hard information. His reports, passed to DCS/NY through his business representative in New York, have been evasive and, in some instances, utterly false. Fabrication has in some cases been obvious.

3. In brief, CHARLES is trying to coarce the U.S. Government into some sort of support for his presidential aspirations. Should anyone listen to him, it would simply mean that the U. S. would have to take over the entire operetion and move him in behind a regiment of Marines. State Departmant, Haiti Desk, has long considered him highly undesirable.

BUT THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH WITHOUT FOREIGN HELP TO STAY IN POWER. HE WARNED THAT IF U.S. GOVERNMENT HELP IS NOT FORTHCOMING, THE CASTROITE HAITIANS HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF SEIZING POWER.)

2. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES HAS BEEN DRAWN FROM INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS RELIABLE SOURCES: SINCE ABOUT 1963, CHARLES HAS TRIED TO GAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF AS THE SUCCESSOR TO PRESIDENT DUVALIER; HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN OPPORTUNIST, SHREWD, CAPABLE, AND UNSCRUPULOUS, AND HAS DUVALIER'S CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAS USED TO FURTHER HIS OWN EFFORTS AGAINST DUVALIER. THE INFORMATION WHICH FOLLOWS APPEARS TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CHARLES' ATTEMPTS TO PANIC THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THEREBY GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY CONSIDER CHARLES AS THE LESSER OF A NUMBER OF EVILS.

HIS ALLEGED SUPPORTERS, LISTED BELOW, ARE BELIEVED TO BE INSIGNIFICANT AND HIS ALLEGED ARMY SUPPORTERS ARE SUSPECT, CHARLES' REFERENCE TO FIDEL CASTRO AND DOMINICAN PRESIDENT JOAQUIN BALAGUER AS HIS COMPETITORS IN A RACE TO OVERTHROW DUVALIER IS CONSIDERED TO BE WITHOUT BASIS - A CALCULATION BY CHARLES TO FORCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S HAND IN HIS FAVOR.

3. CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK OF HAITI, WHO IS PLOTTING TO OVERTHROW THE ΗΛΙΤΙΑΝ GOVERNMENT, IS TO UNDERGO A MINOR THROAT OPERATION ON 14 JUNE 1967 IN PORT-AU-PRINCE. CHARLES WANTED TO HAVE THE OPERATION IN THE U.S., BUT DUVALIER "STRONGLY SUGGESTED" THAT IT BE DONE LOCALLY.

4. CILARLES, WHO IS INCREASINGLY FEARFUL THAT DUVALIER WILL BECOME AWARE OF HIS PLOT AND WILL "ELIMINATE" HIM, AGAIN PLANS TO SEEK U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. HE DESCRIBED THE CONDITIONS IN HAITI AS NEAR CHAOTIC AND REITERATED THE NEED TO GET RID OF DUVALIER. HE SAID THAT HE NOW HAS 290 SOLDIERS (OFFICERS AND MEN) WHO ARE READY TO STRIKE AT ANY TIME AND KILL DUVALIER. CHARLES BAID THAT HE AND HIS "HIGH-RANKING ARMY OFFICER FRIEND" FEEL THEY HAVE ENOUGH AMMUNITION AT THEIR COMMAND TO HOLD OUT FOR 24 HOURS.

12 June 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM: Kenneth T. Ripley

SUBJECT: Assessment of Clemard Joseph-Charles.

Clemard Joseph-Charles, President of the Commercial Bank of Haiti and President of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce, is the source..

For four years Charles has tried to gain U.S. support for himself as successor to President Duvalier.

He is an opportunist of the first water-shrewd, capable and unscrupulous. He has played Duvalier's game to the hilt, often entrusted with missions abroad which were, in effect contrary to U.S. government interests. (He played a principal role in the attempt to smuggle B-26 aircraft out of the U.S. for Duvalier's use. In that connection he went to Arizona to try to purchase U.S. Air Force surplus planes, using U.S. citizens of suspicious nature as his agents.)

Charles has been forced in recent months to make leans to the Duvalier government, the last one having been in the vicinity of $700,000. As a result he claims that his bank is in a precarious position. Therefore, he wants out.

Charles has many business interests in Haiti apart from his banking operation (essential oils, sisal etc.). Haitian exiles estimate that as many as 4,000 persons may be dependent upon him for their livelihood. (This includes dependents of his employees).

Charles is poorly regarded by the State Department. The department's stance towards him as a successor to Duvalier has been even more negative than is customary.

The current report turned in by Louis BRUN, his representative in New York, appears to be nothing more than an extension of his attempts to panic the U.S, and thus to gain for himself support as the lessor of a number of

evils. The list of names of his alleged supporters is meaningless. His adherents in the army are not identified and are suspect.

His referral in this, and in a previous report, to Castro and Balaguer as his compotitors in a race to overthrow Duvalier is considered to be nonsense. All this is calculated to force the U.8. hand in his favor.

His attempt: to find a channel to the Pentagon are in the pattern of his action for several years. Should be succeed he might be convincing enough to cause trouble.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARY DEFINITIVE, APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE

SOURCE: A foreign businessman with wide scutaers in Fort-au-Prince who is believed.to report to learns. Chis informatica was'obtainch from a close friend of mind who juubelly was aware that it would reach U.S. cfficials.

1. Clemard Joseph Charles, president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, claims that since Maj. Colson (thra), a close friend, has replaced Cont. Harry Tassy in the Presidential Quard, he (Charles) now has an access to arms and amminition in the bassuant of the Palace and is in a position to carry out a coup against Prosilent Francois Duvalier "in the near future."

   Although no definite dute has been set yet for the coup, Charles is convinced that it must be carried out "within the next few months" to save Haiti from economic and political chaos. Charles, and especially his military friends, feel that 1967 is the year of decision.

2. Although Col. Flare Louis (fr), commander of the Dessalines Barracks, was not cand as a fellow-s, Charles believes that Pierre-Louis knows of and approves his plats to overthrow Duvelier, and that he (Charles) "saitrols" the Dessalinas Derracks through Pierre-Louis. Col. Octave Caillerd is one of the key military figurer of whom Charles pins his hopes. Caillard is thoroughly disillusions with Davalier and is willing to cocperate. Caillard fears that if Duvalier remains in power, Haiti's eccnczy will be samletely rưnst and Haitian exiles receiving guerrilla training in Cuba may attempt to seize power in Haiti.

3. Charles has the support of Capt. Preval (fau), 3 of the Presidential Guard, and realizes that high-ranking officers loyal to Duvalier could cause bloodshed; Caarles and his associates expect violence during the initial stages of the cap.

4. In addition to ships of the Haition Coast Guard, Charles now has the use of a 352-ton converted lanting crart (LC) which normally sails between Jamaica and Port-au-Prince carrying flour, fuel oil, etc.

5. Charles had no contact with Haitian exile groups until early Mey 1967, when he sent an emissary to New York City to talk to Louis Sansaricq, a prominent anti-Duvalier exile, whose entire family was killed by Duvalier's henchmen. Sansaricq agreed to support Charles in a final showdown with Duvalier and promised to line up some of his fellow exiles to support Charles. A close friend of Charles was planning to go to New York in mid-May 1967 ostensibly to discuss port development projects in Port-au-Prince with a U.S. construction firm; however, the real purpose of the trip is to contact Haitian exiles to gain their support for Charles.

6. On 19 May 1967, a group of prominent Haitian exiles held a meeting in New York City to celebrate Haitian Flag Day. One of the organizers of the meeting was Dr. Jumelle (fnu), a medical doctor whose brother was a former Haitian Minister of Finance and who was killed by Duvalier. Another exile who attended the meeting was Vixamar (fnu)? who claims to be a legal advisor to the Republic of Chad and who said that he was going to be the next president of Haiti. The group of Haitian exiles, believed to call itself the "National Organization of Haitian Exiles", has some members who back Charles.

7. Following are prominent Haitians who Charles believes must be eliminated after the coup:

a. Col. Gracia Jacques of the Presidential Guard - Jacques, who is no longer blindly loyal to Duvalier, will be needed in the execution of the coup, and can be bought; however, once power is in the hands of a military Junta and Charles, Jacques will be eliminated.

b. Luc Desir, head of the Tonton-Macoute.

c. Clovis Desinor, Minister of Finance - an "anarchist" with presidential aspirations who has an "underground movement in Haiti."

d. Gen. Gerard Constant, Chief of Staff.

e. Col. Jacques Laroche, Deputy Chief of Staff - a "convinced Communist."

8. If the coup is successful, Charles hopes to give Andre Theard, former Haitian Ambassador to the United States, a diplomatic post. Theard is strongly pro-U.S. Charles regards Gerard Philippeaux, Minister of Health, as a very sick man with no further political aspirations.

9. Close friends of Charles are convinced that Charles has no choice but to carry out a coup with or without foreign help, and that his chances of success are good because several of Duvalier's now appointees to key positions are friends of Charles; also, that Charles must act soon because the morale of many of Duvalier's military and civilian supporters has reached an all-time low and because the Haitian Treasury is almost empty.

Headquarters Comments

1. Coisou may be Maj. Serge Coisou.

2. Probably Lt. Col. Luc Pierre-Louis.

3. Another source has identified Proval as Capt. Walter Proval.

WAS OBTAINED FROM A CLOSE FRIEND OF CHARLES WHO PROBABLY WAS

AWARE THAT IT WOULD REACH U.S. OFFICIALS

ON 24 MAY 1967, CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF

THE COMMERCIAL BANK OF HAITI, SAID THAT HE WAS "100 PERCENT

READY TO GO THROUGH WITH THE 'BUSINESS TRANSACTION' " AND DID

NOT WANT TO WASTE TIME BECAUSE "LOCAL BUSINESS COMPETITORS"

MIGHT GET AHEAD OF HIM. CHARLES REITERATED THAT IT WAS IMPERATIVE

THAT HIS TWO PRINCIPAL "FOREIGN COMPETITORS," I.E., FIDEL CASTRO

AND DOMINICAN PRESIDENT JOAQUIN BALAGUER, BE NEUTRALIZED TO

PREVENT THEM FROM SPOILING HIS "PROMISING. BUSINESS DEAL."

2. ON 30 MAY, CHARLES AGAIN WARNED OF THE NECESSITY OF NEUTRALIZING CASTRO AND BALAGUER BECAUSE OF THE "EXTREME URGENCY OF THE BUSINESS MATTER." (SOURCE COMMENT: IT IS BELIEVED THAT EVEN IP CHARLES IS SUCCESSFUL IN HIS COUP AGAINST DUVALIER, HE STILL WILL FEAR INTERVENTION BY CASTRO AND BALAGUER.) IN THIS RESPECT, CHARLES HAS URGED HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATES TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PREVENT CASTRO AND BALAGUER FROM ANY ACTION AGAINST HIS PLAN, AND HAS ENDEAVORED TO SECURE SUPPORT FROM HAITIAN EXILES IN THE UNITED STATES.

3. LOUIS SANSARICQ, A HAITIAN EXILE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND HIS SON HAVE PROMISED CHARLES THEIR FULL COOPERATION. SANSARICQ'S SON, WHO IS CONNECTED WITH THE HAITIAN COALITION IN NEW YORK, NOW IS PLANNING TO INTENSIFY PROPAGANDA AGAINST DUVALIER AND HIS HENCHMEN. FROM TIME TO TIME, THIS PROPAGANDA WILL ATTACK CHARLES FOR HIS "SUPPORT" OF THE DUVALIER REGIME IN ORDER NOT TO AROUSE DUVALIER'S SUSPICION; THESE ATTACKS, HOWEVER, WILL BE LESS SHARP THAN THOSE DIRECTED AGAINST OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE REGIME.

SUBJECT Plans of Clemard Joseph Charles, President of the Commercial Bank
of Haiti, to Overthrow the Duvalier Government

DATE OF INFO. Early May 1967

PLACE & DATE ACQ. (9 May 1967)

SOURCE: A foreign businessman with wide contact in Port-au-Prince. Source
reports infrequently, but his information is believed to be reliable.
He received the information from a person close to Charles.

1. In discussing the possibility of overthrowing the Duvalier Government in the near future, Clemard Joseph Charles, president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, said he now is ready to initiate his long-planned scheme to seize power with his military and civilian friends in Port-au-Prince, with or without the help of the U.S. Government. If he fails in his efforts to obtain U.S. support for his plan, Charles still intends to go ahead with the plot, but he said the execution of his scheme will take more time. However, Charles believes that it is in the best interest of the U.S. to give him all necessary help in his effort to get rid of President Duvalier who has brought Haiti to the brink of total economic collapse.

2. Charles said that he has rifles and hand grenades hidden "somewhere in Haiti" and that through his good friend Lionel Octave Cayard, commander of the Haitian Coast Guard, three Haitian boats, which carry cannons, will be under his control. Cayard cannot furnish enough ammunition for the cannons, but Charles hopes to obtain the necessary amount from the U.S. Government. He would like to get the ammunition from the U.S. aircraft carrier, BOXER, which has been on duty in the Caribbean area for some time.

3. Besides Cayard, Charles has the support of an unnamed high-ranking Haitian Army officer. Charles and his military and civilian friends plan to set up a provisional junta and get rid of the "enemies of Haiti," that is, Duvalier and his supporters. After the consolidation of power in the hands of the junta, Charles plans to run for President and is convinced that he can win since he has many supporters in Port-au-Prince as well as the rural areas of Haiti. Charles claims that he "controls" the Catholic and Episcopal clergy, teachers and students, several businessmen, and army militiamen in the rural areas who are waiting for his signal to overthrow the present regime.

4. Charles has stated that should he become President of Haiti, he would pursue a pro-U.S. policy, eliminating the Duvalierists and the Communists and establishing a "liberal democratic" regime.

5. Charles still is pretending to be a loyal supporter of Duvalier; however, his position has become shaky and he believes that his life is in danger. Ho feels that ho may fall victim to Duvalier unless he (Charles) strikes first. For the time being, Charles will continue to support Duvalier in an effort to allay the President's suspicions. As president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce, Charles soon will deliver a speech praising the achievements of Duvelier. He is anxious for the U.S. to know that his overtures toward Duvalier are pretense and that he is determined to go into action against the present regime.

Headquarters Comments

C8-311/05457-67, from another reliable source, reported that Charles and Herve Boyer, former Minister of Finance under Duvalier, were contending for power in the Haitian. Government.

1. In the past several months, Charles has made numerous attempts to elicit support fran several U.S. Government agencies for his plot against the Duvalier Government.

2. No reason was given for Charles' belief that it would be in the best interest of the U.S. to support his scheme to overthrow Duvalier. However, he may be referring to his claim that should he become President of Haiti following the overthrow of Duvalier, he intends to pursue a pro-U.S. policy and establish a "liberal democratic" regime.

3. Source Comment: Cayard, who enjoys the confidence of Duvalier, is a secret ally of Charles.

# SUJECT: Rev Messages from Clemard J. Charles/Current Haitian Exile Activities in New York City

1. On 20 May 1977, Louis A. Ponas, President, B & B International Corporation, New York City, furnished the following information:

2. Clemard Joseph Charles, President, Banque Commercial d'Haiti, Port-au-Prince, claims that his military and civilian anti-Duvalier forces are organized in "strong units ready to strike when the time arrives." He also claims to have supporters among Haitian exiles in the US and "on the islands surrounding Haiti."

3. Charles reiterated his previous assertion that he will depose Duvalier with or without the help of the US, but he would prefer to make contact with a "US liaison man in Port-au-Prince to speed up things."

4. The financial crisis deepens each day. Revenues are falling, and foreign capital continues to stay away. Attempts to sell treasury bonds abroad and attract tourists have utterly failed. In an effort to attract foreign investment, Mr. Auguste, Haiti's former ambassador to the UN and recently appointed ambassador to West Germany, persuaded a businessman from Kuwait (name not given) to have an audience with President Duvalier on 25 May 1967 in order to discuss a business deal. Charles expects to be present on this occasion.

5. Duvalier is not well. In addition to diabetes, he has what Charles describes "arteriosclerosis psychosis." He is very much upset by the failure of his son-in-law, the Minister of Tourism, to call Haiti to foreign tourists. He is also disturbed about the recent behavior of his other son-in-law, Lt. Col. Maximilien Dominique. According to Charles, Dominique incurred the presidential wrath by moving out of the palace with his wife and Mrs. Duvalier without Papa Doc's permission. After Duvalier personally brought the party back to the palace, Dominique resigned his palace assignment via his wife. Duvalier angrily refused to accept the letter of resignation from his daughter saying that, "as long as I am the president, people cannot resign -- they are fired."

6. Charles states that Oracia Jacques, chief of the Presidential Guard, "will be needed in the execution of the plan." He feels that Jacques is no longer blindly loyal to Duvalier and that he can be bought. Once the power is in the hands of a military junta and Charles, Jacques "will be eliminated."

7. The banker further states that honest and competent citizens, who are also pro-US, will be brought into the government. Some of the exiles now in the US will be in the government.

8. Charles insists that he and his friends are strong enough on the domestic scene to do away with the Duvalier government "sooner or later." His greatest fear is that either Castro or Balaguer might interfere in Haiti's affairs following a coup against Duvalier. He earnestly hopes that the US will neutralise Castro and Balaguer. Charles is convinced that Duvalier and Balaguer are "close friends." He feels that the time has definitely come for the US Government to get in touch with him now in Port-au-Prince. If his wish is granted, he will divulge his plan (names, etc.) to the "liaison man."

9. On 19 May 1967, a group of prominent Haitian exiles had a meeting in New York City to celebrate Haitian Flag Day. One of the organizers was Dr. Jeanjille, an M.D., whose brother, a former Minister of Finance, was killed by Duvalier. Another exile in attendance was (fnu) Vixamar, who claims to be a legal adviser to the Republic of Chad. Vixamar, who is described by Brun as a mystic, stated, "I am going to be the next president of Haiti." Brun believes that the group calls itself? National Organization of Haitian Exiles. According to him, some of the members are now backing Charles' presidential aspirations.

10. Louis Lévêque, a member of the Economic Planning Board of Haiti, a confidant of Charles', will come to New York City after a few days' stay in Miami, Florida, and Memphis, Tennessee. On 19 May 1967, Lévêque will meet with representatives of the J. G. White Engineering Corporation, 80 Broad Street, NYC, to discuss the port modernization project of Port-au-Prince. According to Brun, Lévêque has "some very important information relative to the Charles' plan."

Case 47,500 (Beupenel)

SUBJECT: Additional Information Concerning Plans of Haitian Banker, Clemard Joseph Charles, to Overthrow the Duvalier Government

1. Louis A. Brem, 3 and B International Corporation, 1138 Broadway, New York, NY, furnished the following additional information concerning new developments in Haiti and plans of Haitian banker, Clemard Joseph Charles, and his military and civilian associates to overthrow the Duvalier government.

2. Colonel Gaillard, Chief of the Haitian Coast Guard, is definitely one of the key military figures on whom Charles pins his hopes. Gaillard is thoroughly disillusioned with Duvalier and is willing to cooperate with Charles. Gaillard fears that if Duvalier remains in power, the economy of the country will be completely ruined and that Haitian exiles now being trained in guerrilla warfare in Cuba may attempt to seize power. As a prosperous dairy farmer, whose wealth is estimated to be approximately US$1 million, Gaillard has a large stake in the future of Haiti. He feels that "patriots such as Charles and himself" must eliminate Duvalier and his henchmen.

3. Although Charles did not name Colonel Pierre Louis, officer in charge of the Casernes Dessalines, Port-au-Prince, as a fellow-conspirator, there is reason to believe that Louis knows and approves the plans to overthrow Duvalier. Charles and Louis are good friends; the banker was best man at the wedding of the Colonel's daughter. When the government was unable to pay Louis and his soldiers on time, on several occasions, Charles advanced money so that Louis and some of his trusted associates "could eat."

4. Engineer Louis Lereve, a member of the Economic Planning Board of Haiti, is also aware of Charles' plans. Lereve is a respected public figure who has made several trips to the US in an effort to obtain capital for the Haitian economy. He has given up all hope and is convinced that the Duvalier government must be eliminated.

5.  Charles claims the support of a substantial segment of the clergy, intelligentsia, teachers, and students as well as peasants in the rural areas. As a devout Roman Catholic, he maintains a close relationship with the church authorities and also befriended Msgr. Reane P. Gilles, Msgr. Vamalle's successor at the Nian-Xelles Church's. St. Trinite Cathedral in Port-au-Prince. In addition, he claims to have several important newspapermen on his payroll.

6.  Charles is fully aware of the danger confronting him and his fellow-conspirators, but they are determined to "eliminate" Duvalier and his supporters. Bute Charles "controls" Casernes Dessalines through Colonel Louis, and the Coast Guard through Colonel Caillard, he is confident that in the event of a successful coup by a military junta he and his associates will be able to round up the principal supporters of Duvalier. Although 'he tes his man, Captain Preval, of the Presidential Guard, he realizes that higher-ranking officers loyal to Duvalier would cause bloodshed. Charles and his associates expect violence during the initial stages of their coup. No definite date has yet been set for nation, but Charles is convinced that the coup must be carried out "within the next few months" to save the country from economic and political chaos. In any case, Charles and especially his military friends feel that 1967 is the year of decision.

7. At present, Charles has no contact with Haitian exile groups. However, initial steps to establish a good relationship with exiles in the US have been taken. In early May 1967, Bria met Lasile Manwarring is president and anti-Duvalier exiles, whose entire family was killed to Duvalier's handalaima. Manwarring agreed to support Charles in case of a final abecum vin ProLiant Duvalier. Moreover, bhe promised to line up some of his fan meties for Charles and his friends. Negotiations between dassa oni America are in progress.

8. Dr. Fourvand, an M.D. in Haiti, is no longer trusted by Duvalier. Nor Duvalier and his family have the services of four doctors: Dr. Matark, an orthopedist; Dr. Doversary, another orthopedist; Dr. Suntape, a general practitioner; and Dr. Mart-frutes Dplesi. Arvalier's diosities to irs. Ada Scott Mabu. A male nurse, Tunga Jouds, is entrusted with taking periculis Flood mper toute ur Duvalier. Jouds is well liked by the President, who made him a member of the Bugtalatiiva Camber.

9. Charles is of the opinion that Duvaller is determined to remain in Haiti and face any opposition from inside and outside the country. Although Duvaller is confident that he can rout any inside crisis, he has made a secret agreement with President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic. Duvaller asked for and was granted asylum in the Dominican Republic in the event his government is overthrown. The two presidents maintain close liaison through Andre Bliana, a member of the Legislative Chamber in Haiti. Simo, who, according to Charles, is responsible for the murder of several anti-Duvalier persons in the Jacmel area, frequently travels in a jeep with diplomatic license plate between Santo Domingo and Port-au-Prince. Blazon received a diplomatic passport from Duvaller. While on business in Santo Domingo, he stays in the presidential palace.

10. It seems that the "battle of the nons-in-loi" has been won by Fouchard, Minister of Tourism. In early May 1967, Duvaller's other son-in-law, Dominique, who is an Army officer, moved out of the presidential palace together with his wife. They took up residence in Port-au-Prince but their independence did not last long. After a few days in their new home, President Duvalier and his bodyguards made a "friendly visit" to the Dominique home and took his daughter and son-in-law back to the presidential palace. Charles believes that Dominique is now virtually a prisoner. He also learned from those close to the palace that Duvaller either will appoint or has already appointed Dominique to a foreign diplomatic post, which amounts to a "golden exile." At the same time Fouchard continues to enjoy Duvaller's full confidence. He is allowed to visit New York City with his wife "to promote Haitian tourism." After an unsuccessful stay in the US, Fouchard flew to Mexico City, where he was also unsuccessful in his bid to attract Mexican tourists; but as a consolation prize, he received a decoration from the Mexican government.

11. Charles made the following comments to Blum concerning certain individuals in Haiti:

a. Gracia Jacques, in charge of the Presidential Guard. He compromises with him in case of coup; he must be eliminated.

b. Lao Savoir, head of Ton Ton Macoute. Must be eliminated.

c. Clovis Desinor, Minister of Finance. He is an "anarchist" with presidential aspirations who has some "underground movement in Haiti," to be eliminated.

4. Gerard Philippemix, Minister of Health. In early May 1907, he was in New York City to seek treatment of a serious brain tumor condition. A very sick man, he no longer has political aspirations.

e. General Derari Constant, chief of staff. To be eliminated.

f. Thiard, a former ambassador to the US. He is strongly pro-US. Charles hopes to give him a diplomatic post when he is in a position to do so.

g. Colonel Jacques Laroche, deputy chief of staff, "a convinced Communist." To be eliminated.

12. Charles stated that Dr. Laughlin, a US citizen, an M.D., who lives with his son in Port-au-Prince, is "an undercover agent for Duvalier." As one-time Laughlin was running a tannery for Duvalier; his son is now in charge of an extensive rice plantation.

13. If Charles receives no US help against Duvalier, he will act on his own. However, he knows that without US help (ammunition, weapons) it may take several months before he and his friends are ready to strike. During the interim period, he will endeavor to undermine the Duvalier government on the economic front. To be specific, he plans to tell his foreign friends connected with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that they must abandon the present regime to complete economic chaos. In addition to furnishing a copy of his memorandum addressed to Duvalier to the US ambassador in Haiti on the wrongdoings of Henri Bislatt, president of the Haitian Tobacco and Match Monopoly, he gave copies to "foreign economists." Charles feels that soon the "economic situation of Haiti is absolutely hopeless" he and his friends will be able to carry out the coup.

## NY-419-67
15 May 1967
Case 47,340 (reopened)

SUBJECT: New Developments in Plans of Haitian Banker, Cleuard Joseph Charles, to Overthrow the Duvalier Government

1. On 11 May 67, Edmond Vilaire, a Haitian national, who operates a 352 ton converted LC as a cargo ship in Port-au-Prince, arrived in New York City. On 12 May 67 in the company of Louis A. Brun, B & B International Corp., New York City, he stated the following. (Letterhead of the Port-au-Prince firm is attached.)

2. President Duvalier has just transferred Captain Harry Tassy of the Presidential Guard to a rural post and replaced him with Major Coicou, who happens to be a good friend of Cleuard Joseph Charles. Charles claims that through Coicou, he now has access to arms and ammunition in the basement of the palace and is in a position to carry out a coup "in the near future."

3. After an explosion near the palace in mid-April 1967, Duvalier quietly embarked upon a major shake-up in the military and the civil service. He dismissed or transferred a number of Army, Militia, and Ton Ton Macoute officers and civil servants, including those who had previously served in the presidential palace. To date no official announcements have been made concerning these important changes.

4. In addition to Captain Tassy, the following officers lost their positions in Port-au-Prince:

a. Captain Laroche of the Presidential Guard; transferred to an unknown post outside the capital.

b. Major Sony Borges of the Army; Borges, a confident of Duvalier, was in charge of radio propaganda. He used to see the president at least twice a day. Borges was transferred to a town in the northwest region of Haiti.

c. Paul Varga of the FMI.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 197

FY-419-67
Page 8

5.  Veriquis, who was in charge of the TTM in the Pétionville section of Port-au-Prince, was dismissed by Duvalier because the President suspected him of siding with the Dominique clique. Dominique, an Army officer and son-in-law of Duvalier, was offered a military attaché position either in Spain or Italy, which he refused to accept as his wife is reluctant to leave Haiti at this time. This situation is complicated by the decision of Duvalier's wife to side with her daughter. The rift in his own family as well as the attempt of his enemies to disrupt the celebration of his 60th birthday and the 10th anniversary of his taking office prompted Duvalier to remark that the only man he trusts is Gracia Jacques, commander of the Presidential Guard. This statement antagonized even those who have hitherto been loyal to Duvalier. Moreover, even the most faithful Duvalier supporters now fear for their lives. Colonel Caillard, who is in charge of the Coast Guard, bitterly complained to Charles about Duvalier's remark and reassured the banker that he and his friends were ready to set up a military junta.

6.  In addition to the Coast Guard ships, Charles would have the use of Vilaire's converted LC, which normally plies "the waters between Jamaica and Port-au-Prince carrying flour, fuel oil, etc. Vilaire is convinced that Charles has no choice but to carry on the coup with or without foreign help and that his chances of success are good since several of the new Duvalier appointees to key military and civilian positions are Charles' friends. Vilaire feels that Charles must act now since the removal of many of the military and civilian supporters of Duvalier has rendered an already low and the Haitian Treasury is almost empty. Since Duvalier has been unable to obtain foreign capital, he has again resorted, through his Secretary of State for Commerce and Industry Lobert Jean-Pierre, to a shake-down of commercial and industrial enterprises. In a circular letter, dated 2 May 67, the Secretary appealed for "voluntary contributions as a fitting homage to the Venerable President for life, Chief of the Duvalierist Revolution." (A copy of the letter is attached.)

7.  Jean-Pierre and Henri Blaise, confidants of Duvalier in charge of the Anglio de Tovar and des Alouettes, are among the staunchest supporters of the president. Both men have stolen considerable amounts of public funds and succeeded in smuggling some of their money out of Haiti.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 198

NY-1419-67
Page 3

8.  Secretary of State for Justice Fenema Estimé, who is a good friend of Captain Isnay, is in serious trouble. Estimé, a brother of a former president of Haiti, may lose his position. Since he himself has presidential ambitions, he may become a candidate for this office if he survives the present crisis.

9. Another potential rival for the presidency is Secretary of State for Labor and Social Welfare Max A. Antoine, who claims the support of the labor unions.

10. According to Vilain, the wildest rumors are rampant in Haiti. For example, even intelligent persons give credence to the allegation that the US Government is not really anxious to see the downfall of Duvalier and that a portion of the $340 million hitherto allocated to President Balaguer of the Dominican Republic as development loans was passed on, with the tacit consent of the US, to "Balaguer's good friend," Duvalier. Another rumor states that the CIA is now in the process of training Haitian exiles in the US for a possible invasion of Haiti. The name of Luc Fouché, a former Sénéque in Haiti and a former Ambassador to the US now in exile in New York City, has been mentioned as one of those receiving training in guerrilla warfare.

11. One of Vilaire's aims during his present visit to the US is to convince influential Haitian exiles that Charles is not a Duvalier supporter and that he would make a good president. Vilaire has already contacted, through Bazin, Louis Dejoie, a prominent anti-Duvalier exile in New York City, and hopes to meet other exile leaders.

12. Bazin stated that the newly appointed representative of the UNDP (United Nations Development Program) in Port-au-Prince, a Greek, has just returned to New York and stated that he will not go back to Haiti because he discovered that funds granted by the UNDP were "misappropriated by the Duvalier government."

13. Bazin also asserted that an organization comprised of US citizens and calling itself the "Society for Haiti" will try to raise money for nutrition, education, reforestation, cultural and economic developments in Haiti. Manous, Haiti's Ambassador to the US, is connected with this organization. An OAS mission is expected to be in Port-au-Prince this week and Manous will be on hand. (A copy of a list of 140 names of persons supporting the Society for Haiti is attached.)

14. Engineer Louis Leveque, a member of the Haitian Economic Planning Board and a close friend of Charles', is expected in New York on or about 29 May 67 ostensibly to discuss port development projects of Port-au-Prince with the J. G. White Engineering Corporation, 80 Broad St. The real purpose of his visit, however, is to contact US friends and Haitian exiles in an effort to gain support for Charles.

15. Charles and Brus talked on the phone 12 May 67. The banker stated that he is "tied down" in Port-au-Prince until the end of May, at which time he may make another business trip to the US.

16. Brus is firmly convinced that Charles has already made the decision to overthrow the Duvalier government with his friends and that he must act fast to prevent chaos and a possible Communist take-over. Vilatre and Brus agree that the political and economic situation in Haiti is such that "the population wants a change, any change, and would even welcome a Communist coup." They added that Charles and his military friends wish to prevent a Castro-supported Communist seizure of power.

SUBJECT: Plans of Haitian Bankar Clemard Joseph Charles to Overthrow
the Duvalier Government Case 47,540 (Re-opened)

1. En 9 Biky 1967 Louis A. Brun, B&B International Corp., New York
   City, furnished the following information.

2. He and Clemard Joseph Charles, President of the Banque Commerciale
   D'Haiti and President of the Chamber of Commerce of Haiti, have discussed
   in detail the possible overthrow of the Duvalier Government in the near
   future. During his visit to New York City in the first week of May, 1967,
   Charles stated that he is now ready to execute his long-planned schomo
   to seise power with his military and civilian friends in Port-au-Prince,
   with or without the help of the United States Government. Charles
   further stated that he had rifles and hand grenades hidden "somewhere
   in Haiti." In addition he will have, through his good friend Colonel
   Caillard, Chief of the Haitian Const Guard, three Haitian boats under
   his control. Caillard, who enjoys the confidence of Duvalier, isa
   secret ally of Charles and is now ready to place the three boats, which
   carry cannons, at the disposal of Charles. The trouble is that Caillard
   does not have enough ammunition for the cannons, Charles hopes to obtain
   the necessary summuiition from the US Government. He would like to receive
   the amsınition from the US Carrier, BOXER, which has for some time
   been on duty in the Caribbean area. Charles believes that it is in the
   best interest of the US Government to give him all necessary help in his
   effort to get rid of Duvalier who has brought Haiti to the brink of total
   economic collapse.

3. Besides Caillard, Charles has the support of an unnamed high-
   recking Baltian Army officer. Charles and his military, as well as
   eivilien, friends plan to set up a provisional Junta and get rid of the
   "gpenics of Haiti," that is, Duvalier and his supporters. After the
   consolidation of power in the hands of the Junta, Charles will run for
   President. He is convinced that he can win since he has many supporters.
   Sa Port-au-Prince as well as in rural areas, Charles claims that he
   "controls" Arman Catholic and Episcopalian clergy, teachers and students,
   several businesmen, and key militia figures in the rural areas who nov
   vait for bio signal to overthrow the present regime.

4. Charles to still pretending to be a loyal supporter of Duvalier.
   Rowever, be fools that his life is now in danger and unless he strikes..
   first, he way fall victim to the President. His position has become
   shakay. In early 1967, at Duvalier's request, he submitted a memorandum
   to the President describing the wrong doing of Henri Biclait, who is in
   charge of the Regio de Tabae and Des Allumettes (tobacco and match industry),


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 212

but it appears that Duvalier took Siclait's side. According to Charles, Siclait has been successful in raising money for Duvalier and also had beautiful homes built for some of the President's key supporters. Charles stated that he had given a copy of his memorandum on Siclait to the US Ambassador in Port-au-Prince.

5. Although he has relationships with the US diplomatic service in Port-au-Prince, Charles expressed his desire to "cooperate with a Liaison Officer from the US". When asked to elaborate, he stated that it would be too dangerous to contact a US diplomat in Port-au-Prince; instead he would prefer to cooperate with"a Liaison man from the Pentagon."

6. Charles stated that as President he would pursue a pro-UB policy, eliminating the Duvalier elements and the Communists and establishing a "liberal democratic" regime. If he fails to receive US help in his effort to overthrow the present Haitian Government, he will still go ahead with the planning, but the execution of his scheme will take more time.

7. For the time being, Charles will continue to support the Duvalier government, in an effort to allay the suspicions of the President. Charles, in his capacity as the President of the Haitien Chamber of Commerce, will soon deliver a speech praising the achievements of Duvalier. Charles is anxious for the US Government to know that this is just a pretence, that he now is determined to go into action against the regime, and that he knows that he and his friends are facing an extremely difficult task.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.

SOURCE A foreign businessman who has lived in Haiti for a number of years and who is acquainted with high officials of the Haitian Government. He is an untested source. Source obtained this information from a high-level Haitian Government official.

1. Haitians Clemari Joseph Charles and Herve Boyer are contending for power in the Haitian Government, and each has hopes of succeeding President Francois Duvalier. Although they are working together and will join forces in order to get rid of Duvalier, they probably will start fighting between themselves once this objective is obtained.[^1]

2. Colonel Jacques Laroche is the military's primary contender for power, and undoubtedly he will be the one to consolidate a military movement against Duvalier. Since the dismissal of high-ranking military officers by Duvalier in November and December 1966, Laroche has enjoyed the greatest power within the Army.[^2]

3. If Duvalier is assassinated, it is likely that there will be bloodshed in the strests. In this event, it would be the Army who would step in immediately and control the situation. Despite the fact that the Army 1s small and weakened from its loss of high-ranking offficers, it still would be powerful enough to neutralize any effort by the Haitian militia (VEN) because the VEN is disorganized and would be unable to cope with the confusion which would be caused by an unnatural death of Duvalier. However, if Duvalier dies a natural death there would be less chance of hostilities because the people around Duvalier would have a better chance of taking power.

4. There is little chance that Favalier vill step down from powar volun- tarily because of his pride. However, in this respect his family, particularly Mrs. Duvalier, has constantly encouraged him to give up the presidency and appoint a successor.

Headquarters Commente

1.  Charles is president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, and Boyer
    is a former Minister of Finance under Duvalier. Another source,
    whose reporting has been infrequent, but considered reliable, has
    reported that Boyer has signed a contract to work with an interna-
    tional organization in Europe. If Boyer leaves Haiti, it is possible
    that he will forego his ambitions for power in the Haitian Govern-
    ment, or that his endeavors will be hampered seriously by his
    absence from the country.

2.  Laroche is Deputy Chief of Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces, His
    ambitious and corrupt character, and his overtures toward Duvalier,
    have gained him his power within the Army over the placid, easy-
    going General Gerard Constant, Chief of Staff of the Haitian Army.

SOURCE A foreign businessman with wide contacts in Port-au-Prince. Source reports infrequently, but his information is believed to be reliable. He received the information from a person close to Charles.

1. In discussing the possibility of overthrowing the Duvalier Government in the near future, Clemard Joseph Charles, president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, said he now is ready to execute his long-planned scheme to seize power with his military and civilian friends in Port-au-Prince, with or without the help of the U.S. Government. If he fails in his efforts to obtain U.S. support for his plan, Charles still intends to go ahead with the plot, but he said the execution of his scheme will take more time. However, Charles believes that it is in the best interest of the U.S. to give him all necessary help in his effort to get rid of President Duvalier who has brought Haiti to the brink of total economic collapse.

2. Charles said that he has rifles and hand grenades hidden "somewhere in Haiti" and that through his good friend Colonel Octave Cayard, commander of the Haitian Coast Guard, three Haitian boats, which carry cannons, will be under his control. Cayard cannot furnish enough ammunition for the cannons, but Charles hopes to obtain the necessary amount from the U.S. Government. he would like to get the armmunition from the U.S. aircraft carrier, BOXER, which has been on duty in the Caribbean area for some time.

3. Besides Cayard, Charles has the support of an unnamed high-ranking Haitian Army officer. Charles and his military and civilian friends plan to set up a provisional junta and get rid of the "enemies of Haiti," that is, Duvalier and his supporters. After the consolidation of power in the hands of the junta, Charles plans to run for President and is convinced that he can win since he has many supporters in Port-au-Prince as well as in the rural areas of Haiti. Charles claims that he "controls" the Catholic and Episcopal clergy, teachers and students, several businessmen, and key militiamen in the rural areas who are waiting for his signal to overthrow the present regime.

4.  Charles has stated that should he become President of Haiti, te would pursue a pro-U.S. policy, eliminating the Duvalierists and the Communists and establishing a "liberal democratic" regime.

5.  Charles still is pretending to be a loyal supporter of Duvalier; however, his position has become shaky and he believes that his life is in danger. He feels that he may fall victim to Duvalier unless he (Charles) strikes first. For the time being, Charles will continue to support Duvalier in ar effort to allay the President's suspicions. As president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce, Charles soon will deliver a speech praising the achievements of Duvalier. He is anxious for the U.S. to know that his overtures toward Duvalier are pretense and that he is determined to go into action against the present regime.

Headquarters Comments

08-311/05457-67, from another reliable source, reported that Charles and Herve Boyer, former Minister of Finance under Duvalier, were contending for power in the Haitian Government.

1.  In the past several months, Charles has made numerous attempts to elicit support from several U.S. Government agencies for his plot against the Duvalier Government.

2.  No reason was given for Charles' belief that it would be in the best interest of the U.S. to support his scheme to overthrow Duvalier. However, he may be referring to his claim that should he become President of Hatti following the overthrow of Duvalier, he intends to pursue a pro-U.S. policy and establish a "liberal democratic" regime.

3.  Source Commerts Cayard, who enjoys the confidence of Duvalier, is a secret ally of Charles.

FIELD REPORT NO.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.

SOURCE: A foreign businessman with wide contacts in Port-au-Prince who is believed to report accurately what he learns. This information was obtained from a close friend of Charles who probably was aware that it would reach U.S. officials.

1. Clemard Joseph Charles, president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, claims that since Maj. Coicou (fmu), a close friend, has replaced Capt. Harry Tassy in the Presidential Guard, he (Charles) now has an access to arms and ammunition in the basement of the Palace and is in a position to carry out a coup against President Francois Duvalier "in the near future." Although no definite date has been set yet for the coup, Charles is convinced that it must be carried out "within the next few months" to save Haiti from economic and political chaos. Charles, and especially his military friends, feel that 1967 is the year of decision.

2. Although Col. Piarn-Louis (fmu), 2 commander of the Dessalines Barracks, was not named as a fellow-conspirator, Charles believes that Pierre-Louis knows of and approves his plans to overthrow Duvalier, and that he (Charles) "controls" the Dessalines Barracks through Pierre-Louis. Col. Octave Caillard is one of the key military figures on whom Charles pins his hopes. Caillard is thoroughly disillusioned with Duvalier and is willing to cooperate. Caillard fears that if Duvalier remains in power, Haiti's economy will be completely ruined and Haitian exiles receiving guerrilla training in Cuba may attempt to seize power in Haiti.

3. Charles has the support of Capt. Preval (fnu),3 of the Presidential Guard, and realizes that high-ranking officers loyal to Duvalier could cause bloodshed; Charles and his associates expect violence during the initial stages of the coup.

4. In addition to ships of the Haitian Coast Guard, Charles now has the use of a 352-ton converted landing craft (LC) which normally sails between Jamaica and Port-au-Prince carrying flour, fuel oil, etc.

5.  Charles had no contact with Haitian exile groups until early May 1967, when he sent an emissary to New York City to talk to Louis Bandaricq, a prominent anti-Duvalier exile, whose entire family was killed by Duvalier's benchaen. Sansarica agrieŭ to support Charles in a final showdown with Duvalier and promised to line up some of his fellow exiles to support Charles. A close friend of Charles was planning to go to New York in mid-May 1967 ostensibly to discuss port development projects in Port-au- Prince with a U.S. construction firm; however, the real purpose of the trip is to contact Haitian exiles to gain their support for Charles.

6. On 19 May 1967, a group of prominent Haitian exiles held a meeting in New York City to celebrice Haitian Flag Day. One of the organizers of the meeting was Dr. Jumelle (fmu), a medical doctor whose brother was a former Haitian Minister of Finance and who was killed by Duvalier. Another exile who attended the meeting was Vixamar (fru) who claims to be a legal advisor to the Republic of Chad and who said that he was going to be the next president of Haiti. The group of Haitian exiles, believed to call itself the "National Organization of Haitian Exiles", has some members who back Charles.

7. Following are prominent Haitians who Charles believes must be eliminated after the coup:

a. Col. Gracia Jacques of the Presidential Guard - Jacques, who is no longer blindly loyal to Duvalier, will be needel in the execution of the coup, and can be bought; however, once power is in the hands of a military Junta and Charles, Jacques will be eliminated.

b. Lama Desir, head of the Tonton-Macoute.

c. Clovis Desinor, Minister of Finance - au "anarchist" with presidential aspirations who has an "underground movement in Haiti."

d. Gen. Gerard Constant, Chief of Staff.

e. Cal. Jacques Laroche, Deputy Chief of Staff - a "convinced Commumist."

8. If the coup is successful, Charles hopes to give Andre Theard, forear Haitian Ambassador to the United States, a diplamatio: post; Theard is strongly pro-U.S. Charles regards Gerard Philippeaux, Minister of Health, as a very sick man with no furths political aspirations.

9. Close friends of Charles are convinced that Charles has no choice but to carry out a coup with or without foreign help, and that his chances of success are good because several of Duvalior's new appointees to key positions are friends of Charles; also, that Charles must cot soon because the morele of many of Duvalier's military and civilian supporters has reached an all-time Lov and because the Fedtion Treasury is almost empty.

Source Anwer: Students, as well as educated persons, listen regularly to two foreign radio broadcasts -- one emanating from the United States and one from Cuba. The Cuba station, which emphasizes Communist ideology, appears to be popular with the intelligencia and students while the "man-in-the street" prefers the U.S. broadcasts.

3. Mr. BALOG then commented regarding paragraph 2 above as follows:

"The radio station mentioned above is located somewhere in Massachusetts, according to our source and his Haitian friends in New York City. The believe it is a CIA operation."

4. Clemard Joseph CHARLES' Army friends mentioned above may possibly include Jacques LAROCHE, Deputy Chief of Staff.

Reference: PORT AU PRINCE 4342

1. On 8 January 1967 Subject again made contact with RACHFIELD. Contact was established through one of Subject's assistants who came to RACHFIELD's home at approximately 1750 hours on 7 April 1967. Subject's assistant asked RACHFIELD if he would like to borrow some books on the history of Haiti and if so he could go to Subject's home and make a selection. RACHFIELD, in order to stall for time to affect the proper coordination, stated he would be able to proceed to Subject's home the following afternoon at 1600 hours. On the morning, of 8 April RACHFIELD touched base with both the COS and Chief, LNIURE who agreed that RACHFIELD should go to see Subject.

2. Subject was expecting RACHFIELD and apologized to RACHFIELD for not proceeding to RACHFIELD's home himself but explained that he was afraid RACHFIELD may have had guests. He proceeded to tell RACHFIELD that the economy of Haiti was in a deplorable condition and that noone can tell the President what to do. He then left the room and returned a minute later with a copy of "Le Moniteur", the official Haitian newspaper, which, he said, would not be released until sometime the following week. This newspaper stated that the Haitian Government plans to pay for the minting of new silver coins. Subject was very upset because, he stated, the Haitian Government cannot afford such an expense. The newspaper was turned over to LNIURE.

3. Subject once again referred to R.CiField that he noted that he was willing to answer any questions. He also stated that the outing Chief, Larun would inform the incoming Chief, because he believes that he is most willing to cooperate with R.CiField because the salvation of his country depends on such cooperation.

4. Case Officer Comments. Charles appeared much more at ease during this meeting than he did at the previous one. It appeared as though he actually wanted to talk to someone and knew that he could trust RACFIELD not to leak the conversation to the GUI. R.CiField, once again, left the door wide open for future conversations.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

Reference: DIRECTOR 85314, 21 March 1967

1.  A dark negro about 5'7" tall, Clemard Joseph L. Charles was born at Gonaives, Haiti, on 21 April 1923. According to himself, his father was a professor and his mother a "simple peasant". According to others he is sensitive about his origins and is reported to have changed his name from Canerien because of the connotation of nothingness implied in the name. His father is variously reported to have been a carpenter and a peasant. He received his primary education at the parochial school and graduated from the Lycee Geffrard in Fort au Prince in 1939. According to his own account he taught in rural schools, worked as a pathologist, upholsterer, time-keeper, plantation supervisor, and free-lance journalist. In 1947 he was appointed Controller General of Haitian Southern Banana Industry and in 1948 became General Agent. The following year he established himself as Manufacturer's Representative and created his own export and import, business. In 1959 he went to London as a member of the Economic Mission of the Haitian Government, and in 1954 negotiated on the Haitian Government's behalf a contract with the General Electric Co., Ltd. of Coventry, England for the modernizing, and extending of the telecommunications system of Haiti. He later said that both his ventures into the banana and telecommunications businesses were unsuccessful due to political interference. His success story, according to a U.S. official "apparently hinges on the fact that he feels that he has achieved stature in the community both socially and politically". Charles states that he created the Banque Commerciale d'Haiti (CH) in 1960 and is now the sole owner. The /Continued/.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

Hit-2005 (cont)

principal officer in Charles' bank when the bank was opened in 1900 with Charles as president was an american citizen in the savings and loan business named LILLIS (fnu), who was later indicted, convicted & jailed in the United States for using the mails to defraud. Another original partner of the bank, one Gerald F. Connolly from Chicago, Illinois has a criminal record and various jail sentences and convictions. Neither LILLIS or Connolly are currently signatories to the bank, nor partners. The bank is reported to have a very poor portfolio of loans since, according to rumor, the loans have been made to government officials on the basis of their signature and without proper collateral. Besides the bank, he is also full or part owner of several other industrial and commercial enterprises in Haiti and is the sole representative in Haiti of the General Electric Co., Ltd., London and the Siemens Schukert Werke, Germany. He is Director of Fort Concession (after Mohammed Fayed departed) and also took over the oil refinery concession which originally belonged to Valentine. (Now involved in litigation with AID over their investment guarantee.)

2. Charles is President of the Chamber of Commerce, and also belongs to several other commercial and civic organizations including the Committee for the Rehabilitation of Rural Sections of Haiti, the International Club of Commerce of Haiti, the Commerce and Industry Association of New York, and the Rotary Club. (According to a report of March 1967, he was dropped from the last club in 1966 for non-attendance.)

3. In March 1967 he was forced to give up his interest in a number of smaller concerns (Sonatrugo, Haitian Tobacco, Haitian International Leather, etc.) but retained his monopoly of the insurance business and the bank as well as his individually-owned export-import business.

4. Although it is obvious that Clemard Joseph Charles has been a favorite of President Duvalier, the recent changes in his financial empire indicate a loss of trust. The economy is in such a poor shape that Charles is not making as much out of his enterprises and the money and credit squeeze is hitting him as well as the rest of the more honest businessmen in Haiti. As symbols of past favor Charles has been decorated with the Order of Petion and Bolivar (Commander), the Order of Agricultural Merit (Commander), Knight of the National Order "Honor and Merit", Officer of the Labor Order, and Commander of the Civil Merit Order.

5. One well-informed high United States official reported in early 1963 that Charles was a "slippery character" but that some doubt existed concerning his importance or political significance within the regime. A few months after this estimate was made, Charles conversed with a US Embassy official. Throughout their talk he showed an obvious desire to demonstrate his total political disinterest in the past while simultaneously hinting that he could become a political figure in the near future. He made guarded statements about the Duvalier regime, unhesitatingly giving the impression that he was the President's friend, both through desire and necessity, but that he definitely did not agree with some of the government's policies. He attributed his support of the current government to the fact that it would be dangerous for a Haitian to withhold it. The following month (May 1963), on a business trip to the United States, Charles told a former US Journalist that he was in a position to become head of a provisional government after Duvalier was removed from the scene. He expressed a belief that the President was ready to institute a reign of terror and that he was willing to accept Soviet aid. In the opinion of the Journalist, Charles firmly believed that this was the last chance for the United States to help establish a democratic Haiti, friendly toward the United States, and save the country from a Castro-type Communist takeover. Charles also said that although he was on good terms with the President, he felt /continued/

NTPA-2005 (cont.)

that he had gone crazy and must be stopped before he liquidated the opposition. Charles talked freely of his wide range of support (peasants; forcibly retired, anti-Duvalier army officers; intellectuals; journalists and businessman) and of the prominent individuals who were anti-Duvalier and ready to back "my government". He added that if he did not become Provisional President he would be satisfied with the post of Secretary of Finance and economic Affairs. In addition to his having reached the constitutional age requirement for President (40), Charles gave as another qualification the fact that he was of "100 per cent black origin," noting that only those in this category could win the presidency.

6. Charles said that if he were to be President he would need the "moral and economic help of the US Government and people" to transform Haiti into a true and prosperous democracy. He noted that he would need about a year to put into effect his "plan for the economic and social development of Haiti", which included the following points: creation of a balanced economy adapted to Haitian conditions; and modernization of agriculture. He said that he would like to present this plan to US officials for their consideration.

7. Charles endeavors to attract US venture capital for various Haitian projects and claims to be thoroughly pro-United States. He is reported to be an honorary citizen of the city of Long Beach, Long Island, New York, having promoted a "sister city" relationship with that town and Port au Prince; in 1962 he reportedly received the key to the City of New York. He has visited the United States, the United Kingdom and Western Europe many times on business trips. In July 1964 Charles traveled to Mexico and the United States, ostensibly to discuss the establishment of a sisal cordage factory in Haiti, but in reality to obtain 30 surplus T-28 trainer aircraft. Charles subsequently was reported to be attempting to purchase 24 US surplus naval craft for Haiti's armed forces.

8. He is married to Sophie, nee Lherisson, and has an adopted son.

9. Personality. Charles is generally considered as shrewd but not intelligent. This is borne out by his willingness to cooperate with the international swindler, Mohammed Fayed in a number of money-making schemes which came to a grinding halt when Fayed absconded with an undetermined but large amount of money. He has little sense of economic realities and is apparently sensitive about his knowledge or lack thereof. The Embassy reported in December 1965 that at a meeting Duvalier was holding with Antonio Andre (President of the National Bank of Haiti - BNRH) that Andre should be made to divert some of the "coffee money" from the National Bank to Duvalier's own needs. (apparently Charles was referring to certain taxes on coffee exports which go to the Bank for debt amortization.) Andre roundly criticized Charles and other self-styled financial and fiscal experts in the Government, and aided by telling Duvalier that if the latter followed the advice of such persons he would wreck Haiti. Charles reportedly burst into tears and was taken ill. This gave rise to the story which was current at the time that he had had a nervous breakdown.

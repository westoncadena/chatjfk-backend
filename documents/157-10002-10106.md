Agents will be spotted in several areas including the United States, but posts for operatisual severity morous will probably not be used in their countries of residence. Present developmental activity is bening conducted in the WE and EE areas, but it is muticipated that this will be extended to other division areas. The project will be operated against third-country mistallationce and personnel.

2. Objectives: The objective of this project is accordance with requirements levied on the Clandestine semus, de Mchomh chum hice these requirenients subject to frequent revision, no listing of targets would be valid for the duration of the project.

3. Dacleground: Su response to the incressing requirements Division D in 1960 begon the spotting of

period requirements for A became more refined and in many respects more sensitive. Because most stations are not equipped to conduct this type of operation and because of the desirability of completely centralised control over this entire effort, it was determined that Division D could best conduct the activity. The first spotting activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the ODA category.

4. Operational assets:

(1) Personnel: QJWIN is under written contract as a principal agent, with the primary task of spotting agent candidates. QJWIN was first contacted in 1958 in connection with an illegal narcotics operation into the United States. For a period of a year and a half she was contracted to sporadically, in behalf of the Bureau of Narcotics. Files of this Bureau reflect an excellent performance by QJWIN. On October 1960.

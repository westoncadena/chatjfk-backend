Espionage Activities in Connection with The Gregory Case:
Member of the SILVERMASTER Group.

BENTLEY advised that COE was considered relatively unimportant to the S Group. Then BENTLEY first became aware of COE he was in South America on a mission for the Treasury Dept., but during all but two months while he was away he was in touch with the SILVERMASTERS. He communicated directly with the SILVERMASTERS, sending them reports and other info to which he had access.

BENTLEY believes that COE also gave the info to "Harry Dexter WHITE and that this info was eventually furnished WHITE to the SILVERMASTERS.

BENTLEY in 1945 could not definitely recall having seen any material which could be identified as definitely originating with COE, but she does state that the info supplied by him was made available for transmittal to BENTLEY's superiors.

It is BENTLEY's recollection that he supplied economic info.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE US Citizen; Businessman who has visited relatives who reside in China

1. Frank Coe has received a promotion within the ranks of the Ministry of Finance; however, the specific position to which he has been promoted is unknown. When the US devalued the dollar, Coe determined Chinese policy regarding the devaluation. It is speculated that the People's Republic of China (PRC) will be taking a more active role in the world money market and that Coe will be in charge of that operation. He recently was given a new home that is extremely large and beautiful. It contains approximately 25 rooms with two large courtyards. The interior is beautifully decorated with paintings and artifacts. The house is comparable to the home of Madame Sun Yat-sen, which would also tend to indicate that Coe has become a person of prominence.

2. Sol Adler, who has acted as a financial advisor to the PRC for a number of years, had a lung removed in 1972 because of cancer and he is making a satisfactory recovery. He has been able to work only a few hours since his operation, but outwardly he appears healthy once again. He recently traveled to Hai Tan Tao with Dr. George Hatem to inspect the island, but it was mostly a rest trip for Adler. Adler's wife, Pat, is teaching higher education at the University of Peking.

3. Dr. Hans Mueller, head of the Medical School, University of Peking, was granted a visa from the Japanese Government to travel to Japan with his wife. Mueller's wife is Japanese and she has been permitted to travel to Japan, but it took ten years before they could travel together. They brought her mother back to Peking with them and she is now living with them. Mueller stated that there is continuous pressure on him to increase the production of medical doctors, and he is finding it difficult to find qualified students to enter the medical school; this means qualified educationally and by Party standards. He feels a cut in curriculum time would be detrimental rather than beneficial, so he continues to advocate a five- to six-year course of study.

After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927. she firmly upheld Dr. Sun Yat-sen's three great policies of alliance with Pussia, co-operation with ore Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers, resolutely resigned ali ner posts in the reactionary Kuomintang government, openly exposed the reactionary features of Chiang Kai-shek and waged an uncompromising struggle. During the war of resistance against Japanese aggression, she actively responded to the call issued by the Chinese Communist Party fer [a] national united front against Japan and resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policy of passive resistance against Japan and active opposition to the Communist Party, and of false democracy and real dictatorship. She took an active part in the anti-Japanese democratic movement. After the southern Anhwei incident of January 1941, she sterhly condemned Chiang Kai-shek's criminal plot to launch a civil war and waged unremitting struggle to persist in resistance and cppcse capitulation, persist in unity and cppose a split and persist in progress and oppose retrogression. During the period of the liberation war, she was indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policy of national betrayal, dictatorship and civil sar; she actively called on ard organized the democratic fcrces in the Kuchintang to cppose Chiang Kai-shek, crganized the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, responded to the Yay 1, 1948 call of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for the corvening of the new Political Consultative Conference, and contributed to China's new denccratic revclution.

After nation-wide liberation, Madame Ho Hsiang-ning became member of the Council of the Central People's Govement, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, chairman of the Commission of Overseas Chinese Affairs and chairman of the Union of Chinese Artists. She consistently supported the leaderssip of the Chinese Communist Party and teck the socialist read. in the struggle against foreign and domestic enemies, she stood firmly and showed a clear distinction of whom to love and when to hate. Particularly, in the struggle against the rightists in 1957. she stemly condeared the anti-party and anti-socialist Callacies of the bourgetis rightists. She warmly praised the great sccialist actherland, often through her poems and paintings. She paid great attention to affairs of state, supported the Great Proletarian Cultura Revolution and worked energetically and consistently in defence of ine territorial integrity of the socialist sctherland and for the liberation of Taiwan.

Madame Ho Esfang-ning was a revolutionary comrade-in-arms of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary companion of Mr. Liao Chung-kai, a close friend of the Chinese Communist Party and an outstanding representative of the Kucmintang revolutionaries. She warmly loved the netherland, the socialist system, the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao. Fadame Ho Hsiang-ning remained a revolutionary and a fighter all her life.

We deeply mourn over the death of Vice-Chairman Ho Estang-ning. Let us turn car sorrow into strength. and, under the leadership of the Chinese Comunist Party, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and unite to win still greater victories!"

Attached herewith is a copy of DCS Memorandum SF 68-72 reporting the results of contact with Professor Aaron C. Waters of the University of California at Santa Cruz concerning the individual and organization which contacted Santa Cruz in early summer 1971 with reference to the travel to China of Dr. Robert Coe. As will be seen, this contact did not resolve the issue, however, from the details given, it appears possible that the contacting organization was LHERGO.

Case 57,563 - Robert E. Coe, Report of Initial Contact - Professor
Aaron C. Waters, Department of Earth Sciences, University of California
at Santa Cruz

Headquarters memo on Case 57.568, 30 December 1971
SF-994-71 (Sensitive), Robert S. Coe, 28 December 1971, on Case 54.476

1.  On 20 January 1972 we met with Professor Aaron C. Waters,
    Department of Earth Sciences, University of California at Santa Cruz,
    and a cordial but not very productive discussion ensued concerning the
    "US Government official" who showed on campus during the early part
    of the summer 1971. Professor Waters could recount few lucid details
    of what transpired on that particular day. In general, Waters appeared
    confused and even slightly pixillated over the whole matter; at one
    point he remarked that he was very pleasantly surprised to discover
    that Hudson was not the same individual who badgered him a few months
    ago. How Waters formed the belief that the same man was going to see
    him at the time of our appointment is unclear, for we explicitly out-
    lined our reason for seeing him when we scheduled the interview. At
    any rate, the following information, incomplete as it may be, was pro-
    vided by Waters.

2.  The incident occurred in late June or early July 1971 just
    prior to Coe's visit to mainland China. A man came to the door of
    Waters' office and said that he wished to ask some questions about
    Robert Coe. He was about five feet eight inches in height, weighed
    about 150 pounds, had dark hair, and used glasses only for writing.
    He wore a sport coat and a colored shirt. Neither the name of this
    individual nor his affiliation can be recalled by Waters for "he
    resembled a great deal." Nor can any of the information on the creden-
    tials be remembered except that they were similar in design to the
    ones used by the Agency (we allowed Waters to scrutinize ours) but were
    not in color. For openers the man asked why Coe was going to China,
    and then began to ask about Coe's parents. He then inquired about
    Coe's character and whether he belonged to any subversive organizations.
    This persistant and offensive line of questioning really turned Waters
    off, and the man was asked to leave. Waters doubts if the individual
    were any kind of an impersonator because he has had "similar experiences"

vita the FBI in the past. Needless to say, Waters maintains a high regard for Robert Coe and felt such questions were an infringement upon Coe's privacy and were completely unwarranted.

3. During our conversation with Waters he left the room momentarily and went into Robert Coe's office directly across the above. Then he returned he explained that he told Coe about our presence and asked his to join us for a few moments. Coe could not. "Unless directed otherwise, we plan no further action on this matter.

He praised the heroic Cuban people for the tremendous victories they won under the leadership of Prime Minister Fidel Castro in opposing U.S. imperialist aggression, subversion and interference, defeating national independence and state sovereignty and building up their motherland.

He said: This year U.S. imperialism unreasonably detained Cuban fishing boats and fishermen on the high seas on two occasions and savagely attacked a fishermen's village in Cuba and killed innocent inhabitants there, committing one crime after another against the Cuban people. The Cuban navy recently captured two pirate ships which participated in the counter-revolutionary activities against Cuba. This is an entirely just action. U.S. imperialism has gone so far as to rampantly bluff and threaten Cuba and other Latin American countries and people who are fighting in defense of their national independence and state sovereignty. The Chinese people strongly concern U.S. imperialism for its criminal activities against Cuban and other Latin American people and resolutely support the people of Cuba and other Latin American countries in their just struggle against U.S. imperialism.

He said the fact that people of all Latin American countries are joining forces to resist U.S. imperialist aggression and control has become an irresistible historical trend. Whatever tricks it may resort to, U.S. imperialism can never stop the people of Cuba and other Latin American countries in their victorious advance.

Ambassador Jesus Barreiro Gonzalez said: "We are very glad to be invited to attend the gathering this afternoon in commemoration of the 13th anniversary of the victory of our country's liberation, which is filled with fraternal friendship."

He said that January 1, 1959 was a day of special significance. It marked the successful completion of a stage in the struggle for the liberation of Cuba. In a century and more, the ambassador continued, the Cuban people have resisted attempts at colonialist and neo-colonialist domination, the basic hallmark being the liberation wars in 1868 and 1895 against the Spanish colonial yoke and the struggle against U.S. imperialism which attempted to replace Spain and occupy the land of Cuba. He said a new stage began in 1959 after the overthrow of the Batista dictatorial regime which was abetted by the United States.

The ambassador pointed out that the U.S. imperialist government has continued carrying out its policies of aggression, sabotage, subversion, blackmail, economic blockade, invasion and piratical attack against Cuba. But all these schemes have met with the most ignominious failure.

He said that the restoration to the People's Republic of China of her lawful rights in the United Nations and the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the UN is a victory for the people of the world and a failure for the U.S. imperialist government.

A Cuban film "Hundred Tears of Struggle" and a Chinese film "The Working Class Creates Miracles" were shown at the reception.

INTERNATIONAL APPAIRS

"The nat-cral liberation novements of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America are continuing to surge forth vigorously. The revolutionary mass movements of the pecpies of Europe, North America and Ccearda are developing in depth. Comtries want independence, nations vant literation and the people want revolution--this has become an Irresistible historical trend. The truculent practice of power politics and hegemony by the superpowers has ret with the strong resistance of an increasing number of small and medium countries; the superpowers are beset with internal and external difficaities and are having a tougher and tougher tine."

The Chinese vice prerier said: "In external affairs, our country has firmly carried out Chairman Kao's proletarian revolutionary line in foreign affairs and won great victories. The exchange of friendly visits between our people and the people of other countries, including the American people, is continuously expanding; and the number of countries which have established diplomatic relations with our country is ever increasing. The vain scheme of the superpowers to blockade and isolate China has gone totally barkrupt!"

He continued: "The domestic situation of our country is also excellent. Since the Hinth Congress and the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth Central Committee of our party, the whole party, the whole army and the whole ration, acting on our great leader Chairman Hao's instruction 'carry cut education in ideology and political line', have unfolded a deep-going poverent for criticizing revisicnisu and rectifying the style of work, further heightened their consciousness of class struggle, the struggle between the two lines and of continuing the revclution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and have won great victories. The struggle-criticism-transformation campaign of the Great Proletarian Cultural Fevolution is continuing to develop in depth. We have reaped bumper harvests for 10 years running. & new upsurge is emerging in industrial production. Prices are stable and the market [is] flourishing. The revolutionary spirit of our people is rising higher than ever. Our socialist notherland is prospering and thriving with each passing day."

Vice Prenier Li Hsien-nien wished the experts success in their work and good health. In conclusion, he said: "Let us work together to better promote the rutual understanding and militant friendship between the Chinese people and the people of other coun tires and support and assist the world revolution!"

# L. DETAILS OF MEETING (continued)

1. DELASCIO initiated this meeting with STCICY/1 to discuss about the following operational matters:-

a) Can he write to Dr. S.C. SUNG, the Taiwanese bio-chemist in Vancouver, B.C., and invite him down to Los Angeles for a visit?

b) What is the medical publication he has received which purports a travel of American scientists to Mainland China?

c) Has he found out the name of that 'Mrs. YANG' who first talked about the travel plans of the American/Chinese engineers?

2. In reply, STCLOY/1 answered as follows:

a) He can write to Dr. S.C. SUNG, but he does not have a good reason to request for his visit. Unless there is a medical conference or certain occasion of interest to SUNG, STCIOY/1 feels he can not just suggest SUNG to make a trip to see him.

b) The medical publication which reports the interest of some American scientists in the travel to Mainland China is 'Biomedical News' (copy of the news attached). The II/5-71 issue of the news has published an article written by Harry L. TENANT entitled 'Scientists Bid For Travel to China', which names Dr. William McElroy, director of the National Science Foundation, and Dr. Philip HANDLER, president of the National Academy of Science, as ones who had suggested to make a trip jointly to China. The article also promotes the cultural exchange of scientists between Mainland China and U.S., and it credits members of two academic committees for their efforts.

c) The name of that 'Mrs. YANG' is 'Mrs. Paul YANG'. Paul YANG, husband of the woman who first talked about the travel plan of a group of local Chinese engineers to Mainland China, is an engineering staff of Southern California Edison Company, Los Angeles. STCIOY/1 does not think that the travel plan as mentioned by Mrs. YANG has materialized yet. Therefore, there is not much to be found out.

3. STCLCY/1 showed DEIASCIO two postcards which STGAZER/1 and STEEK/1 had sent him from Spain. He understood that STGAZER/1 had returned to Los Angeles a few days ago, and he is going to meet STGAZER/1 to find out when is he going to Canada to bid for travel permission to China. STCIOY/1 also agreed to contact Dr. ROSENFELD to check about their movements as well as new activities of HAN Suyin. STCLOY/1 believed that HAN might play an active role in the near future in the Chinese-American relation developments.

4. DELASCIO sought STCLOI/1's assistance to look for a job for TSAI Yin-Ying (201-875838), wife of P'AN Han-Sung. STCICY/1 regretted that he could not help because he does not know directly any hospital laboratory in this area, but he estimated that she should find a position of Lab Assistant to work under a licensed laboratory technician or a clinical assistant in a physician's office if she persists in trying.

# M. ACTIONS PLANNED OR REQUIRED - RECOMMENDATIONS:

a. HQ - For information.

b. Local - Please make Xerox copies of Biomedical News and forward to HQ as members of these committees may be good sources to provide us with information about exchanged scientists.

Will see STCLOY/1 to give him the full address of Dr. SUNG because STCLOY/1 has mislaid it. Then will discuss with him again about what reason he can invite SUNG his visit. Will also pursue the case. of Paul YANG and STGAZER/1 and Dr. ROSENFELD.

K. ACTIONS (continued)

On 30 June 1971, DELASCIO returned STCIOY/1 with the 'Biomedical News'. At the same tire, DELASCIO gave him the business address of Dr. S.C. SUNG, and convinced STCLOY/1 that he could try to write SUNG, stating that STCIOY/1's office address will soon move to a new address and that STCLOT/1 welcomes SUNG for a visit because SUIG will surely enjoy the new tourist attractions in Ios Angeles such as *The Magic Mountain* and *The Lion Safari*. STCICY/1 still doubted that SUNG would spend so much money to make such a trip, but he promised to write this letter inviting him.

# Scientists Bid for Travel

to China

by Harry L. Tennant

WASHINGTON-Nearly 100 U.S.. scientists who are hoping to be China-bound this summer are threading ray through papers, reports, journals and third country is while they patiently rance from the People's Re- China. This was evident reports that three U. S. have been cleared to enter scientific quarters seems to have spurred preparation for what could be an influx into China of U. S. scientific specialists of all types. Early indications point to the possiblity that an exchange of citizens between U. S. and China might place the scientist in a priority position over professions of other areas, as well as the general tourist himself.

Meantime, the overall rush was ob as by a flood of applications and epped-up activity bere in inquies from U. S. professors to China's new and only embassy in North America at Ottawa, Canada. The fast-moving breaks came after the two U. S. scientists, Dr. Arthur W. Galston, Yale University plant physiologist, and Dr. Teman Signer, Massachusetts Institute of Techcology biologist, had received clearance. Another scientist, Dr. Robert Corophysicist, University of California 2: Santa Cruz, also was cleared for entram

Some 10,000 experimental biologists discussed the frontiers of re-:arch in physiology, pharmacology, pathology, immunology and nutrition in mid-April when the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology met in Chicago.

A last-minute change in speakers was made at the General Session April 13 because Dr. Marshall W. Niren-berz. Nobelist in physics in 1968, was in this country were present..

The 400 industrial and institutional exhibits at McCormick Place featured instruments applicable to research in experimental biology.

Among the session cghlights were 28 symposiums of invited speakers and 45 intersociety meetings having to do with current fundamental problems of the diseases that research biologists in all fields are trying to conquer......


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

biomedical, biological, and natural scientists are eager to survey the scientific scene. At the same time it was pointed out that Dr. William McElroy, director of the National Science Foundation, and Dr. Philip Handler, president of the National Academy of Sciences, had suggested that they make a trip jointly to China. This view was part of the feeling in science quarters in Washington that an exchange of scientists between both countries would be very beneficial to the two countries even though all sorts of understandings would have to take place. This was the reasoning expressed by President Nixon's science advisor, Dr. Edward Davis, Jr.

Up to this point there has been no official Government effort to initiate exchanges and an early appraisal of this possibility indicates that funds would have to be obtained to finance any sizeable program. Nevertheless, those on the scene say these could probably come from foundations. It is even quite possible that the White House would push for early passage of an emergency request for funds to see that such a scientific-venture got underway. The present Administration, which credits itself with the break-through which led to the ping pong matches, is certain to push harder for a more forceful exchange now that the door is slightly open, even if the Administration has to finance an exchange from funds which it might consider of an emergency nature.

The updating of papers on Chinese advancements has been underway for some time. The National Academy of Sciences, prepared, about 300 here for just such a possibility in 1968. But the papers remained undisturbed after it became known that an exchange was far in the future.

The Committee on Scholarly Communications with the People's Republic of China, a highly placed group, has been studying the activity intensely. Headed by Dr. John Lindbeck until his recent death, this committee is perhaps the most knowledgeable of any group as to just what is to be found in China, if and when an exchange takes place. Committee members are Professor A. Doak Barnett, Foreign Policy Studies Program, the Brookings Institution, (Chinese Studies); Dr. Horace R. Byers, Academic Vice President, Texas A & M University, (Meteorology); Dr. James

## Medical Progress

- Despite a 25-year period of no exchange of information between the U.S. and China, a vast amount of detailed data has been accumulated, all indicating that China has again stabilized itself after the turmoil of 1966. Since 1969 over 2,000 types of Chinese traditional and Western medicines have seen reduced in price by an average of 30 per cent. Imports of scientific equipment and chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and synthetic fibers have dropped because of China's improving capability to produce its own instruments, machinery and chemicals. This accounts in some measure for the fact that the Department of Commerce does not expect a vast amount of medical goods and equipment to be exported when and if the Administration relaxes controls on movement of non-strategic goods to China.

## Western Influence

The Autumn Canton Trade Fair recently gave some indication of the trends in China. Among the changes noted were the 30 per cent increase in customers and the Chinese favoritism for West European countries, especially France and Italy, at Japan's expense. Exhibits at the fair reflected numerous technological advances over the previous year. Among the displays were silicon-controlled automatic electronic and punch-tape-controlled tools, measuring and testing instruments, oscilloscopes, microscopes, and a wide range of synthetic plastics, resins and such basic drugs as antibiotics, sulphur drugs and vitamins.

The revolution in Chinese education has produced many schools such as the Shantung University of Science and Technology in Tsinan which opened last October.

Chairman Mao's thinking along medical lines is responsible for the "cooperative medical service" intended to bring medical treatment to all rural areas. It has been reported that one-12 third of a million city medical workers and graduates of medical colleges have settled in rural areas while 400,000 others were organized into mobile medical teams to tend rural areas. This has prompted shifting of some hospitals from large metropolitan centers to the country. The Hailung area, it is reported, has set up a so-called "red medical network" designed to enable each production team and factory to have its own highly publicized "barefoot doctors."

In another area all medical school graduates have been dispatched to the countryside and one-half of the medical workers in Harbin, Tsitshihar, Mutanchiang and Chiamusze have been sent to the rural and mountainous regions. "In this spirit," the Chinese say, "they have converted rural homes to allow for surgical operations."

# Curing the 'Incurable'

Other reports point out that the integration of western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine has resulted in successful treatment of many common and recurrent diseases as well as curing some of the "incurable" diseases such as osteomatosis, epilepsy and chronic laryngitis proliforans.

A mass program in which Chinese traditional medicine and medicinal herbs are being used to prevent and treat diseases and heal injuries is sweeping the country, according to reports. Several instances of rejoining severed limbs to the body by using herbal drugs have been described. As part of this broad movement "red medical counters" have been set up in Canton's state-run drugstores to treat minor injuries and illnesses and recurring diseases by several methods including acupuncture and injections.

To assist in the struggle against disease a new type of diadynamic current stimulator used for back strains, sprains and neuralgia has been developed. Transistors substitute for electronic tubes and ordinary dry batteries for alternating current, the stimulator no larger than a book. A transistor device with a freezing microtome and a unit for cryotherapy has been developed, lessening the time for making thin sections for rapid biopsy inspections and used in the treatment of skin diseases and surgical procedures in dealing with warts and tiny vascular tumors.

## Population Control

Shanghai recently has been the scene of posters urging young people to marry later in life, prompting observers to believe the Chinese are taking serious note of the population increase. At a Tokyo family planning conference recently it was reported that the mainland China urben birth rate was down. If this is true, it is the result of a 15-year birth control campaign. Through a combination of contraception, abortion, sterilization and encouragement of the late marriages, China is said to have almost halved its earlier population growth pace.

New developments in the pharmaceutical industry also have been reported. Of particular pride are drugs made from indigenous herb medicines. A new medical herb in Yunnan proved effective in curing 12 cases of acute hepatitis and streptomycin and another antibiotic have been produced from active carbon.

On the research front, there is continued interest in prevention of pollution and re-utilization of waste products. In Shanghai it is reported that an e'ectrolysis plant made six different commodities including cryolite, pare soda and liquified ammonium chloride from waste materials.

## Peking Pollution

According to published reports, Peking shares the Western world's concern for environmental control. Methods for anti-pollution measures inchoade producing new substances from chemicals extracted from waste materials for medical and commercial purposes, using unwanted materials from largsized factories to construct smaller industries, and maximizing possible usage and resusage of material products in order to economize in projas tion costs are under study.

Ia a controlled set of laboratory experiments using operant conditioning techniques, five of seven patients with moderate to severe hypertension were able to reduce their systolic blood pressure by 9 per cent through their conscious reaction to external stimuli such as tones, lights and projected slides.

The reductions in blood pressure occurred during a series of studies inder ze direction of a group of four Harvard investigators in the behavioral laboratory of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory and the Channing Laboratory, Boston City Hospital.

# 2 U.S. SCIENTISTS WILL VISIT CHINA

Biologists Critical of War Said Either to Be There or About to Go From Hanoi
*May 7 NYT*

By WALTER SULLIVAN

Two American biologists are reported by their colleagues to be in China or about to go there from Hanoi, the North Vietnamese capital. A third American, a geophysicist from the University of California at Santa Cruz, is also said to have received permission to visit Peking shortly.

The biologists are Dr. Arthur W. Galston, professor of biology at Yale University, and Dr. Ethan Signer, an associate professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The geophysicist is Dr. Robert Coe, whose father has been living in Peking. Dr. Galston is a specialist in plant physiology who has been an outspoken critic of American defoliation in Vietnam. Dr. Signer, a specialist in the genetics of bacterial viruses, has also been an active critic of the war in Vietnam.

Few, if any, American scientists have been able to visit the Chinese mainland since the

Communists took control is 1949. For a number of years scholarly journals were exchanged, but in about 1966 with the onset of the Cultural Revolution this flow was cut off. In fact, publication of many journals in China was apparently suspended during that period of turmoil.

However, a trickle of publications out of China has continued, primarily to scientists in countries other than the United States. Thus there has been a limited flow of information on developments in such fields as astronomy, archeology and biochemistry.

Some Western Visitors

There have also been some scientific visitors from Western nations whose relations with China were less hostile than those of the United States, notably Britain, France and Canada. In recent years such visits have become rare. However, it is reported that Dr. Pierre Chouard, professor of botany at the Sorbonne in Paris, has now received clearance for a trial.

The sudden opening of China to visits by American journalists a few weeks ago has raised hopes for a breakdown of the barriers against scientists. Last week the Committee for the Development of Scholarly Communications with the People's Republic of China met in Washington to consider possible action.

The committee was headed by Dr. John Lindbeck, director of the East Asian Institute of Columbia University, until his death in January, and a new chairman has not been chosen. It represents the National Academy of Sciences and other learned societies. Under consideration by the committee is an invitation to some Chinese scientists to meetings to be held in this country next summer.

Another group interested in scholarly exchanges is the National Committee on United States-China Relations. It is headed by Dr. Alexander Eckstein of the University of Michigan, an authority on Chinese economics, and includes businessmen and retired government officials as well as scholars.

Of major importance to the scholarly community will be the restoration of exchanges of specialized journals. Visitors to China have found American journals on file at research centers, but the flow has been one-way and, apparently, of a limited nature.

# 'American Friends' at Rallies in Peking

Special to The New Yor's Times

HONG KONG, July 10 РђЊ Frank Coe and Sol Adler, two aging former officials of the United States Treasury Department, appear to be filling the social niche formerly occupied in Peking by Anna Louise Strong the 84-year-old American leftist who died last March after years of service in the cause of Chinese Communism. For the second time in little more than a month Mr. Coe and Mr. Adier were listed this week in Peking reports sent here by Esinhea, the Chinese Communis: press agency, as "American friends" present at a mass function along with top Chinese and foreign officials.

The function, on Tuesday, was a sports performance before 20,000 people in an indoor stadion arranged in honor of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former Chief of State of Cambodia who now heads a Cambodian goverament in exile in Peking.

Mr. Coe and Mr. Adler figured in Washington investigations of alleged Communist subversives in the United States Government in the late 1940s and early 1950's, at the time of the Alger Hiss case. They have both been in Peking for many years and seem to have escaped serious trouble during the Cultural Revolution purges in 1967-68.

## Wives Also in Peking

Whether they have helped the Chinese Communists as financial specialists is not known, but it is thought here they have mainly been employed editing English-language news and propaganda material

Both have wives in Peking. Mr. Adier is author of a book on the economy of Communist China..

There are a few other Americans in Peking in good standing with the regime there, but only Mr. Coe and Mr. Adler have been listed as "American friends" at the two functions. This is believed to indicate that they have been selected to act as the American representational affairs at which the Chinese wish to give the impression of broad international the participation.

## Coe Calls Charges
# 'Outrageous, False'

By Herbert Foster
United Press Reporter

V. Frank Coe, former secretary of the International Monetary Fund, yesterday denounced as "outrageous and false" charges that he was a fugitive and once tried to regulate Austrian currency valuations to favor the Communists.

He read his statement to reporters after secret questioning by the Senate Permanent Investigating Subcommittee. Acting Chairman Karl E. Mundt (R-S.Dak.) said Coe refused to say under oath whether he is a Red.

able to locate Coe and was asking the Attorney General to search for him.

The 46-year-old Coe said he has been out of work since his forced resignation from the Monetary Fund last December and had traveled in Canada, Cuba, the Bahamas and Mexico looking for a job. He would not say why his wife did not know his whereabouts.

Apparently there was little testimony concerning charges by two former United States officials in Austria that Coe tried in 1949 to block negotiations to devalue the Austrian shilling because Communist Czechoslovakia had objected.

Mundt gave Coe until Friday to go over his records. At that time, he will be questioned in private again before testifying in public.

Coe told reporters the subcommittee had released "two serious allegations concerning me... that I was a fugitive, and that I in some manner had attempted, in concert with the Russians or Czechs in 1949, to have the Austrian currency devalued in a way desired by those governments.

"Those allegations are outrageous and false," he said.

Mundt said Coe testified that he is not a spy now nor was he one last December 2. But he said the witness refused to say whether he had been a spy on December 1, when he was questioned by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.

Last Friday, Mundt announced that the subcommittee was un

# McCarthy Suggests Borders
Of Nation Be Closed to Coe

By G. Milton Kelly
Associated Press Reporter

Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wis) suggested yesterday that the State Department "immediately close the borders" to Frank Coe, saying the former secretary of the International Monetary Fund should not be allowed to leave the country.

"I think he is an extremely dangerous man," McCarthy said after Coe, a former Federal financial expert, refused to say whether he is a Communist or was a Communist spy while holding his $20,000-a-year job with the Monetary Fund.

Coe protested what he called McCarthy's "command" to the State Department.

McCarthy told him he had not commanded the State Department to do anything but had suggested that Coe be forbidden to leave the country.

> Associated Press Phote
> FRANK COE
> ... in exchange with McCarthy

The exchange came at a hearing by McCarthy's Senate investigations subcommittee.

Coe was called before a televised public hearing of the subcommittee to answer testimony that in 1949 he had tried to block a revaluation of the Austrian currency opposed by Communist Czechoslovakia.

He came with a lengthy prepared statement in which he denied he had a hand in any such intrigue.

The currency matter was scarcely mentioned, however, as the Senate investigators went over his record and fired questions at him about Communist Party membership and espionage.

McCarthy asked Coe if he had contacted any member of the Russian secret police on a recent trip to Mexico.

Coe replied that he saw a great many people in Mexico. But so far as he knew none was a member of the Soviet secret police.

Asked if he had met with any members of the Communist Party in Mexico, Coe refused to answer. He said that to do so might tend to incriminate him.

Were any of the persons he met there members of an espionage ring? McCarthy asked. Again Coe replied that so far as he knew none was.

It was at that point that McCarthy suggested to L. M. Drury, a State Department security officer present as an observer, that the borders of the United States immediately be closed to Coe.

Coe, 46, is a witness McCarthy's group has been trying to get before it for a long time.

Coe, who showed up Wednesday, denied he was a fugitive. He said he had been looking into employment possibilities in Mexico, Cuba and elsewhere. He resigned his well-paid job with the Monetary Fund last December 2 atter refusing to tell another Senate group whether he was a Communist.

Coe testified he is "not engaged in espionage now and was not last December 2. But he refused, on grounds that the answer might tend to incriminate him, to say whether he was so engaged on December 1.

Datelined: New York, Nov. 29, (AP).

"A cryptic note hinting that the Russians obtained plans for two prewar American superbattleships was read today at an explosive session of Alger HISS' perjury trial.

"The Government also bared secret reports intended to show how a fantastic Soviet underground web was woven deep into Washington in the early New Deal days to influence United States Government Policy.

"Both disclosures came in the form of reports by Government officials of talks with whittaker CHAMBERS, chief accuser of HISS and former courier for a Russian spy ring.

"The battleship note, jotted by Assistant Secretary of State Adolph BERLE in 1939, read:

'Plans for two superbattleships - secured in 1937 - who gave KARP - brother-in-law of MOLOTOV... working with Scott FERRIS got this released -- now; naval architect working on it, why; FIELD was original contact. He introduced Z to GOMPERTZ (Hedda) -- Z relationship was casual -- shall excuse? ---where is Hedda GOMPERTZ? --Z and FIELD supposed to have been both members of party.'

"The Z referred to an individual whose name was blacked out. Defense Attorney Claude B. CROSS said he did not object to the document but thought use of the name would affect the reputation of a dead man.

"MOLOTOV, former Russian Foreign Minister, now is Deputy Premier.

"A Hedda GUMPERZ MASSING is a former wife of Gerhart EISLER, who fled the U.S. last spring after being identified as the No. 1 Communist in this country.

"Mrs. MASSING has been described as a 'cooperative witness' in post-war American spy hunts.

Washington Post Article, dtd 30 Nov. 49

"CHAMBERS has testified that he approached BERLE in 1939 to warn him of Communist activities in the U.S."

"CHAMBERS has also accused HISS of feeding him State Department secrets before the war in wholesale fashion. HISS was indicted for perjury when he denied ever giving CHAMBERS state documents or even seeing him after January 1, 1937."

"HISS was tried for perjury last spring but a jury split eight for conviction and four for acquittal, and a new trial was ordered."

"The second report in the form of twin memos on the underground was full of some of the names from Franklin D. ROOSEVELT's early New Deal. The individuals were described as 'anti-Administration' at the time."

"The names came out in memos written by Raymond MURPHY, Security officer of the State Department, who made notes of two talks in 1945 and 1946 with CHAMBERS."

"The underground's purpose was said in the memos to be 'far more important and cunning' than spying."

"... each member (was) to advance as high as possible in the Government to shape legislation favorable to the program of the Communist government,' read the hitherto secret reports."

"Named in the memos were: Alger HISS and his brother, Donald (HISS); Harold WARE, Lee PRESSMAN, Henry Collins, Charles KRAMER (KRIVITZKY), Helen WARE, Alice MENDHAM, Harry Dexter WHITE, Nathan KAPLAN, Rose WEINSTEIN, Nathan WITT, John ABT, Eleanor NIESCH, Nat PERLOW, and persons identified by their last names only, as CDIER, GLASSE AND COE."

"The guiding genius of the entire underground was identified as Hungarian-born J. PETERS, a 'little dark fellow, small feet and wavy black hair.'"

"Top man and founder of the 10-man Washington cells was said to be the late Harold WARE, who died in 1936, and was allegedly succeeded by Nathan WITT and later by John ABT."

"Immediately below him in order of importance, the reports charged, were Lee PRESSMAN, former general counsel of the CIO, and Alger HISS, later to become a top-level State Department aide."

"The memos said HISS' job 'was never to make converts -- his job was to mess up policy."

"The Government aides whom CHAMBERS accused were said in the memos to have 'arranged among themselves a program committing this Government to a policy in keeping with the desires of the Communists.'"}year:"

"Underground beadquarters in Washington, the memos said, included
'a violin study near Dupont Circle run by Helen WARE, (and) a school on the
outskirts of washington run by Alice MENDHAM.'

"CHAMBERS was quoted as saying he entered 'the Washington picture' in
1935 and left it and the party at the end of 1937.

""The heads of the various underground groups in Washington who met with
PETERS,' the memos continued, 'were the HISSES, KRAMER (KRITITZKY), Henry COLLINS
who was either a secretary or treasurer of the group; John 137, Lee PRESSMAN,
Hat PERIOW and Nat WITT.

"These men met regularly at special meetings, with the exception of Donald
HISS, who did not have an organization. They beaded parallel organizations......'

The memos alleged there were other underground Commmist groups in
Washington at the time, 'but this was the elite policy-making, top-level group.

"*It was not a spy ring,' read the records, 'but one car acre important and
cumming because its members helped to shape policy in their departments.'

"The nemos described Henry COLLINS, as an employee of the forestry division
of the Agriculture Department at the tine and said he took the lead in deliverying
Government documents to CHAMBERS.

"In testimony after the memos were read, CHAMBERS said sailors or stevards
of the North German Lloyd Line usually took Government secrets to Burope for, the
ring."

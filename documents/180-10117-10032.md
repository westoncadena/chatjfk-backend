Michigan reg. MDH 710 and a Continental D.C. dealer tag D1546.

It was larned from Mrs. David P. Knohl (maiden name Camille
NMN Saviano, W/F 12-24-39) that Jay Knohl was her brother-in-
law; and he rarely lived there. Her husband, David P. Knohl,
W/M, 07-10-41, was not at home at the time of the interview;
however a visitor was present and he is as follows:

Louis Anthony Piccerelli
W/M, 05-04-39, approx. 6'2", 200 lbs.
32402 Barclay Square
Warren, Michigan 48093
(313) 979-4777

Mrs. Knohl stated that she last saw Gino CARRAFA on 07-26-76
at her residence for dinner. Piccerelli stated that he too
was present at the dinner. Mrs. Knohl stated that the family
went to Ocean City, Md. on August 1 and on August 2 one Guy
Sullivan, (301) 768-4331 notified her that CARRAFA was missing.
Mrs. Knohl also stated that she talked to Jay Knohl on
08-05-76 and Jay stated that he gave CARRAGA some money when
he saw him in New York.

Writer had a discussion with Piccerelli and it was learned that
up until a few weeks ago he was a bouncer at Fran O'Brians
Anthony House. Piccerelli stated that he knew Richie McCaleb,
McGowan, Joe Nesline, Becky Sutton; and without any prompting
Charlie Tourine. Piccerelli stated that the aforementioned
were only gamblers and McGowan was too dumb to be a "hit man"
as reported in a media article - *The Washingtonian*.

When I inquired of Piccerelli what he was presently doing, he
stated that in two weeks he and two partners were going to
open a bar in Detroit called "The Three of Us". When I
remarked that Joseph Zerelli might be around, Piccerelli
stated that Joe was too old and his brothers, Tony (Anthony),
and another name, were in jail. Writer commented that some
of Zerelli's family appeared to be moving to New York and he
replied, yeah, they all married into the New York families.
He further stated that the police were trying to pin Hoffa's
murder on Tony Jackalone.

in Brooklyn for possibly writing book; however it was an error as the numbers she possessed were relative to lot and number of pairs of pants she boxed in a garmet house where she worked. Mrs. Knohl further stated that she brought her down from Brooklyn and got her an apartment in Rockville. Maryland telephone directory lists one Jennie Saviano, 199 Rollins Ave., Rockville, Md., 770-6784; and it is noted that she is the only Saviano in the book.

At approximately 1930 hours David P. Knohl called writer, having returned home; however he could not furnish any information. Knohl did say that this was a double shock for Mr. Piccerelli as he burried his wife two weeks ago.

Listing obtained on D.C. dealer tag D 1546 to National Auto Brokers Wholesale, Inc., rear of 5102 Georgia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. (202) 723-4100 and (202) 291-6400.

Writer contacted MSP Trooper Burns reference the three classical cars reported stolen by CARRAFA on 07-22-76 to 07-23-76, and he stated that CARRAFA refused a polygraph three times; and CARRAFA told him that the reason was that he was into other things. Burns feels that the theft of these vehicles was staged by CARRAFA as he showed Burns one point of entry and a United States Fidelity & Guarantee Insurance Adjustor another point of entry. Burns also related that there were no tire marks in the dirt road that led to Gino's Classical Car's garage. USF & G adjustor is one Sharon Kohler, (301) 547-3569.

Burns noted that a vacationing Pennsylvania police officer, on 07-21-76, two days before the theft, observed a blue GMC Tractor with a yellow trailer operated by two negro males at the Union 76 Truck Stop in Colesville, Pa. The truck was being followed by a negro male in a maroon Rolls Royce. The yellow trailer was loaded with six classical cars, a white over black Cadillac, a Mercedes, what appeared to be a Rolls Royce but could have been the Packard and three other cars.

Lastly, Burns related that one Investigator Jones, Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, assisted CARRAFA in going into business. Burns and Hones inspected Gino's numerous times and found violations such as un-notarized titles, but Jones took no enforcement action.

VO with only one or two ounces in the bolle. Several pills were noted on the table with the bottle. Two bottles of prescription of 200 librium only six capsules were in the bottle.

Interviewed the manager of the hotel indicated that he had noticied an odor coming from victim's room and having had previous experience of such contacted the engineer and they went in. Not one of our better places it is right in the Rush street area which is our swinging part of town. She indicated last time she saw her was six days prior when she left instructions for the maid not to clean her room until Tuesday the 20th which is kind of strange. They don't elaborate any more on that.

Alban - that would be the 15th then if she was found the 21st.

Adorjian - yeah and she doesn't want her room cleaned until the following Tuesday OK. In the room were various hospital bills indicating the victim had recently been hospitalized. They were from Henroten and Northwestern Hospitals which are in close proximity to the Maryland Hotel. They went to the hospital, examined the body and nothing other than the decomposition was noted. Went to the Henroten Hospital and revealed victim was in fact patient of hospital, but failed to show for next of kin purposes. Went to Northwestern Hospital and interviewed Doctor Nelson Berrelli and indicated victim was receiving psychiatric care and listed an ex-husband whose name you've got.

Alban - that is Louis Piccerelli

Adorjian - no George E. Hanley

Alban - George Hanley

Adorjian - with an address of another address in here Dr. record victim's father Melvin Bliffen. Door was locked on the inside, 13th floor up, no fire escape. Due to fact all the pills other than that, it is being classified as death investigation waiting outcome of coroners examination and inquest. Apparently, no foul play connected at this particular time unless we have some further information.

|Alban|- yeah, cause|
|Adorjian| -Right off the top of my head I would have to tell you know|
|Alban|- yeah, we could get copies out there. It is way out|
|Adorjian|- going to blow the whistle because of her goofieness|
|Alban|- that could have been it, unless Piccerelli, Lou says he is opening a place in Detroit, I don't know if he happens to be an insurance recepiant. I don't know that at this point, but we're trying to find out why Carrafa got hit. Initially we think it was the classical cars you know, but then all of a sudden they through us this damn curve and of course Lou Piccerelli is an associate of all of them and then his wife has Od and both Piccerelli and Knohls and Knohl has 19 busts in N.Y.|
|Adorjian|- do you, do we have any idea when she came to this city here, Chicago|
|Alban|- no I'm only into this thing for about two days. She according to Mrs. Carrafa's family that she has been in the racketts and dating racketteers in Chicago and of course Piccerelli knows the Zerilli family pretty well in Detroit:, and he knows all the heavy OC figures in Washington, D.C. area and this Maryland suburb. Of course Jay Knohl has been identified bt NYCPD Organized Crime as an unknown maybe a pickup man for an unknown banker up there. He's got 19 busts with numbers, but he is a little bit more than that, we have a big timer down here that was involved with the Marvin Mandel Governor of Maryland indictment and he had a tax lean of damn near 1/2 million and this Knohl called him and said he would bail him out if he could have a piece of the action, probably infiltration of legitimate business.|

Code:

D = Duafala
M = Michaleski
S = Swain

M - Ok, Doris go ahead and go back to when you first met Gino

D - I met Gino last summer, he and some of his friends came into
where I work and I dated him all last summer, he kept in contact
with me after I quit work and went back to school and then when
I came down here again this summer, I went out with him once or
twice and he would come in to see me at work.

M - You say some of his friends, do you know their names?

D - Sully, Jason's brother, Jason, Patrick Sherman

M - Sully, who is Sully, do you know his full name?

D - No not positive, but it might be David Sullivan, I'm not sure

M - David Sullivan

D - It might be, but I'm not sure.

M - Well, how did it come that you met Gino

D - Well I work, uh and his place is just down the
road, they stopped in for a drink and we talked to each other
you know, and he asked me if I needed a ride into work the next
day, which I did, he took me to work and then we just started
going out.

M - Did Gino indicate to you where he lived at?

D - Bethesda, or what ever it is

M - Bethesda

D - yeah, he lived in a condominium there

M - Do you know the address:

D - No, Gino would never give me his address or his phone number,
he didn't want me to know


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

M - Would the name Pooks Hill ring a bell?

D - No

M - How about Prominade

D - No, he has a good friend down there who owns a restaurant that probably would know exactly where he lives

M - do you know who that friend is?

D - no, I know that is where Gino worked quite often

M - Would you recall the name of the restaurant if I happened to mention it to you

D - no

M - he never mentioned the name of the restaurant to you

D - no

M - but he said he lived in a condominium in Bethesda

D - uh huh, I'm pretty sure that is what he said, I'm pretty sure that is what he told me, I never really, Gino just always wanted to keep a lot of things to himself so I never really questioned him too much. I didn't ask where he lived or anything like that

S - How did you get in touch with him

D - I never did, well either I called Gino's Classic Cars or else I didn't get in touch with him. He usually was the one who would get in touch with me.

M - do you think that he was mixed up in something that wasn't exactly on the up and up?

D - yes

M - what makes you feel that way?

D - just for the different times when he wouldn't give me his phone number of his address. He said he didn't give it out to anybody, and at times he said he wished he could tell me things but he just couldn't and a awful lot of times he indicated things but didn't come right out and say

M - such as

D - uh, right off I can't think

M - did he ever make any trips to New York

D - did I

M - did he


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

D - of yes he did

M - frequently or infrequently

D - Uh, pretty frequently, as a matter of fact he was just there, a couple times this summer his partner lives in New York and Gino went there quite often and he spent a good deal of time in California recently.

M - how recently?

D- oh, I guess it was, well it was my second semester of school, you know, which was this past term, so it must have been in February, March, April

M- Did he say why he went to California?

D- I was under the impression it was for art, looking for cars and things like that

M - did he drive out or fly out, do you know?

D - I think he, I'm almost positive that he drove back because that is when he bought his second Lincoln

M - that is the one that he presently owns

D - yes, he owns two presently, and he drove it back and I'm not exactly sure how he got out there.

M - the uh, back up a little bit, you mentioned that you had seen Gino's truck go down the road, Monday and uh that is the brown one, did it have Maryland tags on it or?

D - yes it did

M - it had Maryland tags on it

D - well, uh, you know

M - you assume it was Maryland tags

D - well, I've been in it before and I am almost positive it had Maryland tags on it. I believe he bought it off somebody in Pennsylvania, but it did have Maryland tags on it

M - you don't know who he bought it from do you?

D - no

M - do you recall the name of Gino's partner

D - Jason

M - Jason


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

D - he uh

M - you don't know his last name,do you?

D - no, but I know where he lives

M - you do

D - up at, by, near Coney Island, his house is right on the water

M - you don't by any chance have the address

D - no, his last name may be Sullivan but I am not sure

M - could you describe him, have you ever met him?

D - Oh, yes, several times, Gino and Jason and I went out to dinner and Jason whenever Jason was in the area, Jason and Gino would stop in to see me and I talked to Jason a few times over the phone

M - Could you describe Jason to me?

D - he is a nice looking man, gray hair, medium build, I'd say he is about 5'8", 5'9", blue eyes

M - about how old?

D - I would guess 45

M - how much would you say he weighed?

D - uh 160

M - uh huh, you have been to the house up there

D - yes

M - is Jason married, do you know?

D - no, he may have been married at one time, but presently he is not married, he has a housekeeper

M - do you know her name

D - I can't remember it, I did. meet her, but I can't remember her name

M - but you say the house is located in New York, Coney Island

D - down from Coney, it is in Brooklyn

M - Brooklyn

D - yeah


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

-5-

M - Did Jason ever tell you what kind of business he was in?

D - no, uh, I questioned Gino one time as to what Jason did and Gino evaded the question and another time I asked Gino how come if they were partners, how come it was Gino's Classic Cars and uh you know Gino just said, not to ask questions and made a joke of it as he usually does

M - to your knowledge, did Gino carry a lot of money on him?

D - always

M - always

D - always

M - can you give me an estimate of how much

D - no I never

M - a couple of hundred dollars

D - sometimes even more than that, he always you know had quite large sums on him

M - uh huh, who did Gino have working for him, you know immediate workers, right there all the time

D - Patrick just quit

M - Patrick

D - Sherman, just quit

M - what did he look like?

D - uh, red hair, long, very long mustache, fairly heavy, he was short, 5'7", 5'8"

M - do you know why he quit?

D - uh, Gino said that it was because he felt that he was holding Patrick back and that Patrick was more or less in a rut and Patrick said that he had a lot of things on his mind and Gino had a lot of things or his mind and it was better for both of them if they split. Patrick was back in the area, Patrick had been in a hospital and he came back, a matter of fact he was in Sunday night, the night before the last when I saw Gino and then he also came in with Gino's brother uh and sister-in-law with Patrick when he came in last Monday

M - do you, have you been inside the building up there

D - oh yes


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

M - does he have a lot of cars in there

D - well uh, he used to have three usually three in the showroom and he had about three in the back that he was working on and I don't know if he did sell that Cadillac or if it was stolen or uh, there had been a car in the paint room

M - now did you hear that a Cadillac was stolen in the paint room from California

D - I had heard that only through reading the paper, as a matter of fact someone else called my attention to it, I didn't even know and I couldn't understand why Gino didn't mention it to me that Monday when he was in. Because from the way I understood it, the robbery happened on Friday or Saturday night and Gino was in here Monday and I couldn't understand why he didn't say anything to me

M - you say he had some stuff stolen from the showroom

D - that is what, I was told from other people

M - did he have a large number of people hanging out up there

D - no, he also had another boy working for him, a young kid, named Jay, Jerry, Jack his name was Jack. I think he was only about 16 or 17

M - do you know where he lived at

D - no, he was just a young kid and then of course the uh man who lives next door he re-does furni, he refinishes furniture, he would come over occasionally and the man who has the garage just down from him would come down, but other than that

M - did Gino ever indicate to you that he commuted, commuted between Bethesda

D - oh yes

M - that is a long drive

D - yes it is, I often asked him why he didn't bother to get an apartment or house up here, but he didn't want to

M - did he ever say why

D - no

M - did he ever say why he got located here instead of down in Bethesda, his business

D - he said that he felt this was a better location because of its where it was in relationship to New York and Philadelphia and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

D - some other places, just general it was a better place

M - why wouldn't New York and Philadelphia necessarily be a good location to be close to

D - I don't know

M - you don't know

D - I'm not positive, but I think Gino was thinking of moving out to the coast very soon

M - out to the coast, why do you say that

D - he, uh, liked it out there and he said something to me about moving out there and that uh in talking to his brother that you know the just of the conversation about moving out to the West Coast

M - which brother came to visit him

D - Joe, the baby in the family

M - Joe, where was he from?

D - Connecticut

M - Connecticut. Did Gino ever buy you anything?

D - oh yeah, uh he sent me roses and little things

M - did he ever buy you any jewelry

D - no, not that I can think of

S - I'm just curious, when we first started talking about him, you mentioned the fact that you felt there was something, something wasn't quite right about what Gino was doing and you spent some time in the shop and everything, did you have any idea what that might be

D - no, I uh, I never, I often wondered about it and I even mentioned it to my sister, my sister had advised me to stay away from Gino, but

S - well, why did you tell your sister if she advised you to stay away from Gino

D - just that I thought he was doing something illegal that I thought he was mixed up in something, I don't know what just cars

S - you must have had some guess or something

D - parden me


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 29

-8-

S - you must have had some guess or something

D - no, it was just you know, I thought it was very odd that he would never give me his phone number or things like that and well impression of other things, everything seemed very odd to me

S - for instance, what types of things did you question

D - uh

S - don't miss understand, we're not trying to divulge any evidence against Gino in any way,

M - we're trying to find out who did this to him

D - right off, I just cant think

S - what about his partner, did he every say anything about him

D - no, not anything much

S - how often did his partner come down here, about, that you know

D - oh, not that often, they would call each other quite frequently you know, like once every day, they would call each other

S - once a day

D - probably

S - when you say not that often, how often do you mean

D - uh, lets see, I'd say once every few months Jason would be down cause as far as I know Jason may have been down twice this summer to my knowledge

M - how recently, what is the most recent time that he was down

D - he was definitely down here in June because he stopped in to see me, but he may, I'm not positive, I think he was taking a plane out of Baltimore and I think he stopped in, I think Gino had taken him to the airport, but I'm not positive about that

S - out of Baltimore to where, back to New York

D - I have no idea

S - going back to the very recent past, the last time that you saw Gino was say about two weeks ago

D - uh huh


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

S - and he stopped in and was with who

D - his brother Joe and his sister-in-law and Patrick Sherman

S - OK, did you get an opportunity to talk to him

D - yeah

S - what did the conversation involve

D - oh, they were giving me a hard time before and like being very funny towards Gino and you know they were teasing him about you know things like that, that was basically the, other than general, his brother had bought a new car and he had brought it down for Gino to look at it to see what Gino thought was and the conversation just jumped around about cars and that was about it

M - what type of car was that, do you know

D - it was something like a Vega, something like that

M - he bought it here in Maryland or

D - no, well his brother bought it in Connecticut and wanted Gino to see it and they were on there way to uh Virginia Beach or one of the beaches for a few days

S - did Gino every during the time you said, that you were trying to break off the relationship, at least slow it down some, uh at any time during when you were having a good relationship, did he ever give you any indication of how his business was doing or anything like that

D - uh, Gino always tried to make everyone think that he was doing very well, you known

S - was that including you

D - yeah, occasionally he would you know make a joke if I don't get this car sold that I'm not going to have you know, you know some money, things like that, but usually he would try to make it sound as if he was doing very well and he would try to you know show off his money, try to be very extravigant with his money

S - when you were dating Gino, last summer, about how often were you seeing him

D - about every week and he would take me almost every week

S - once or twice a week, something like that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

-10-

D - well, I'd see him, you know I would see him two, three, maybe
four times a week and then, uh, Gino did buy me a piece of
jewelry, he bought me a charm for a charm braclet, they had
a going away party for me but that was just you know everybody
had bought me, Gino wouldn't always take me out on my day off
because a lot of things would come up that is another thing that
I couldn't understand is uh we would make plans to go somewhere
and all of a sudden he would call me up that afternoon and say
I'm sorry but I must go to Philadelphia for I must go here, he
just made a recent trip to Philadelphia as a matter of fact, uh
he stopped by to take me with him, but I already had another
date, so he left

M - did he say why he was going to Philadelphia

D - no, cars usually

M - this is sort of personal, but did he every purpose marriage
to you

D - yeah, we had talked about it

M - uh, would you say he lived above his means or within his means

D - I don't know what his means were

M - did you get the impression that maybe he is a high roller,
do you know what I mean by high roller

D - uh, yeah, In some ways I think he was and in other ways I
don't know

M - did he gamble any to your knowledge

D - when he was younger he gambled but he didn't gamble any more

M - but the time that you have known him, your knowledge he has
never gambled

D - no he quit gambling

M - how do you know that he gambled when he was younger

D - well he told me stories about you know when they used to go
to the race trach and you know things like this

M - how much, what do you mean by when he was younger

D - either just getting out of the service or while he was in the
service

M - did he ever explain to you how he came into money to set up
his business

D - no, and I never really asked him, Patrick was always saying


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

-11-

D - that Gino worked very hard for everything that he has gotten. Patrick I think was trying to advise Gino to get out of what he was doing, I don't know what Patrick, when Patrick was drinking or Patrick would tell me how you know he wishes Gino would just quit all this and I don't know exactly what Patrick meant by quiting

M - did Patrick go by a nickname

D - no

S - when was the last time that you say Patrick was with Gino and them, where is Patrick now, do you have any idea

D - in Virginia

S - do you know where in Virginia

D - no

S - a guess

D - no, he may be working in construction, but I'm not sure, it is either construction or at a garage something like that

S - does he have any friends, relatives or anyone that he dates around here

D - Patrick, no, I don't know of anybody that he would keep in contact with

S - does he have a car

D - uh a Chevy, I believe it is a Chevy, that Gino had given him

M - did Gino have a bookkeeper or a Secretary of anything

D - no, he had one years ago but she and he hasn't replaced it

S - two or three years ago

D - uh, I guess quite a few you know

M - let me ask you this or maybe you can give us some kind of an answer, or a speculation anyway, since you have known Gino and dated him and so forth, did he ever indicate to you or did you ever get a feeling that maybe there was somebody out to get him

D- no, but uh, not so much Gino, but I knew Jason has had a couple stunts with people in his neighborhood really and they had gone as far as doing damage to cars and things like this, and I knew Jason wasn't too well, you know slashed roof tops and things like this, I knew things like that, but as far as Gino not I didn't know of anything

M - let me ask you this, do you think Jason would ever harm Gino?

D - no

D - I don't think he would, they seemed to get along very well and they seemed to be very close in their business


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

M. - Why would Jason do something like that?

M - Why do you say that?

D - I recognize the suit that Gino has on, it just got that within a year

M - you don't know who the girl is. Are you sure that Gino lived in Bethesda

D - Gino would always just refer to it as outside of D.C. and then just recently he had been more specific where he was living and I know Gino has a housekeeper or somebody, because Patrick told me that Gino had somebody coming in and all the time watching his dog and watching the house for him and Gino didn't get along well with his neighbors as far as I know

S - why do you say that

D - because they always complained about where he parked his cars occasionally I guess he would drive the older cars home and he would want them right on the lawn close to the house and he told me several times when people would come over and try to fight with him he would tell them off and as far as I know he wasn't close to anybody down there, with exception of the man who owned the restaurant, I know he

D - Gino, always, not always, I know he rented some cars through the

M - Partners, 50 50. Did the name Stanley Tashoff ever arise?

D - its uh white and it has Horseless Carriage Carrier written on it

S - about how big is it?

D - I think it is an 18 wheeler, I'm not sure, but I think it is

M - we just came by his place of business and we saw this big tractor trailer parked in the back, without the tractor, does that belong to Gino?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

-15-

D - he had two

M - he had two of them?

D - yeah

M - you don't know where the other one is?

D - did that one say Horseless Carriage Carrier on it?

M - no, this is a pretty big one it takes a tractor to pull an eight wheel

D - OK, this one, this is the one that I just told you about that I believe I saw last Monday night

S - did you get any impression at all, you must have had some impression because you said it wasn't Gino driving it so what kind of impression led you to believe it wasn't Gino?

D - the man in it didn't look like Gino

S - what did he look like?

D - I honestly can't tell you, I honestly can't

M - Does the name Bill Bogley ever come up in conversation, how about a name Ronald, Ronald Smisek? How about a guy by the name of Knohl?

M - Did Gino seem to be upset over the fact that he had three of these cars stolen?

D - no, not at all

M - he didn't?

D - no, that is why probably the reason he didn't mention it to me

S - he never mentioned it to you?

D - never, not once did he say anything about it. He was in an extremely good mood

S - Is Gino going with anybody now since you all have kind of

D - not that I know of, Gino is very set with me, I plan, uh and going to talk with him, but when he came here to pick me up that one time and take me out, he was very upset with me that I already had another date and you know he was in the bar and he tried to joke around with me and try to get me to come over sit with them and his brother mentioned going out to dinner together and I just made light of it and Gino was a little

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

D - upset over that.

M - how does, the name Louis Piccerelli every mean anything? but does, you say Pat Sherman knows, worked for Gino and would know what went on at the shop if anything?

S - why would he leave, did he ever elaborate on, just Gino had things on his mind, he never elaborated on it

D - no

M - did Gino ever mention going to Detroit?

D - no

M - Im sorry, I mean California

D - I can't remember, I thought it was Las Angeles. He even tried to convince me into going out there for a weekend

M - did Gino ever mention anything about having a brother that was in trouble with the law?

D - no Gino came from a very large family and he uh wasn't real close with anybody except his brother Joe was the impressions that I have gotten, he though the world of his brother Joe


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

-17-

M - how about a guy named Bob White? does that ring a bell

D - no

M - Can you think of anything else that would be of some help to us?

D - Not right off I can't

M - let me ask you a question, when you went out with Gino and Jason up in New York, where did you generally go?

D - Oh, I only went out with Jason and Gino one time in New York and that was to an Italian Restaurant, Jolies

M - Julies

D - Giollies, an Italian Restaurant, something like Giollies, Gino and Jason both liked the food there

S - Is it in the city?

D - No, it was, I honestly can't remember, it was run by an Italian family who I guess it has been in the family for years and they seemed to both go there.

S - The charm that he bought you for your braclet what type of charm was it?

D - A little car, a classic car

S - Where was it purchased, do you have any idea?

D - In a little jewelry store in Aberdeen somewhere.

M - Did he always make reference to us people from D.C. you mentioned something that he made reference to us people from D.C.

D - no, no, he always said he lived outside of D.C. and he uh, I always thought that he lived in D.C. up until one time when he got a traffic ticket last summer and when he pulled out a Maryland license, I said I thought you lived in D.C. and he said well I say D.C. but it is really Maryland

M - Did he ever talk about going down to West Virginia any?

D - no, he did go to Pittsburgh in June to give somebody a car, he was selling somebody something it was more like a package then he went you know to Pittsburg and he was going to bring it to here, they had it worked out, so I know Gino went to Pittsburgh in June

M - what time did he generally get into the shop if you know?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

-18-

D - not until late, he wouldn't get in until 11 or 12, never
early

M - and he usually left at a decent hour?

D - well it varied, sometimes he would leave at 6:00, sometimes at
7:00, sometimes he would stay until later on, depending on what
he wanted to get done

S - is this the most recent letter you have?

D - uh, I believe so because I think after that after he went to
Florida is when he went out to California and he didn't bother
to write to me at all from California, he called me he never
would write

S - When he called you did he call collect?

D - No, a lot of times he would call me person to person

M - he would call you at the restaurant

D - No, this was when I was in school

M - Oh, I see, at school

D - yes

M - Did you get the impression that he fouled around a lot with
other women other than you

D - yeah

M - you did

M - was he a jealous type person? in your opinion

D - uh, average, he didn't like it when I went out with other
people and he got upset when he would call up at school and I
wasn't there, he always, he'd joke around, but he meant was
he was joking around

M - did he ever give you any money for your schooling?

D - no

M - did he ever give you any money at all?

D - he offered to do a lot of things for me but I'm not the type
person to take them

M - Like what did he offer you?

D - to put a phone in for me. He offered to get me a car, you


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 40

D - know used, I was trying to decide whether to come back down here again I didn't have a car and he told me that he would give me a car if I came down here

M - how about, you say, Pat lived there

D - yeah, upstairs

M - upstairs, do you have any idea, how long Pat lived there?

D - ever since I've known Gino he lived there

M - for at least two years then

D - well

M - two summers, that you know of

D - a year

M - a year, OK. Who drove the truck usually when there was something to be picked up?

D - Gino used to have drivers, but right now I think Gino was doing it himself, I'm not positive, but I think so

D - Jason's brother and Gino and this other man who will be at that car rental place, all ran around together, the three of them

M - Jason's brother, the guy that ran the car rental place

D - the one that Gino would come see at the car rental place, Gino, uh I was there twice with Gino at this car rental place and both times he was there, so I know he does something there

M - now, this is at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport

D - right and if you can't get ahold of that man

M - what does this man look like?

D - uh, he has glasses and he is dark hair, if you can't get him there I know another place where you would be able to find out some information, it's called the Tim Buck Two Bar somewhere in that area and that man goes there all the time, as a matter of fact Gino used to go there a lot with him

M - and they were good friends

D - you know the first time I met Gino the three of them were together, David and Sully and Gino were together


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 41

-20-

M - David

D - David, Sully and Gino were together, I think that is there

M- you think it is the man that owns it

D - right

M - but you think the person who owns the car rental place maybe Sully or something like that

D - No there is three, David is one person and Sully is another person

M - that runs the place

D - right and it is either David or Sully, I always got the two of them mixed up because whenever Gino would talk about them there and I couldn't keep them straight

M - Well, the reason we asked you if you had any inclination that Gino was married is because he was

D - I thought that he, he had been because, well, last year there would be note on his desk saying, you know, he had gotten a phone call from what was her name Carol

M - uh huh

D - Carol, OK, and uh I didn't want to say anything you know about it to Gino and he suspected that I suspected something and he got real, very upset with me and we argued over it and it is something I didn't want to know either way because I just didn't, I didn't want to no and Gino was real upset that night

S - does that, knowing that he was married does that explain the secret about it, about his business and everything or do you still feel there is something that there is something of a mystery about it

D - I still feel there

S - because you did suspect at the time

M - It isn't that he was married, up until he died he had a wife

D - uh huh

M - OK, I just wanted to make that clear. This is a very mysterious situation and we are trying to get to the bottom of it all and ther is only one way of doing it and that is to talk to people that were associated with him and like I say you have cleared up some questions for us, but if there is anything else that you

NW 88326 DocId:32266807 Page 41


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

-21-

M - can think of that would be of any help to us, to aid us we would appreciate it. We would like to get to the bottom of it

S - Because this has happened so quickly, it is hard for us to keep it in our mind, the garble that Tinker wrote down. Do you know the relationship there, Tinker

D - no

S - Thereiis, there was something in addition to that, that bothered you, that bothered you sister

D - my sister, I made mention to my boss, I don't know if you talked to him or not

M - up at the restaurant

D - yeah

M - yeah, we talked to him

D - but, I thought no it's best to keep that to myself, but I just discussed it with my sister that I suspect that

M - the one time that you went to New York, did you drive up

D - yeah we drove up in a rented car

M - in a rented car from where?

D - I don't know, he picked me up, he picked me up in the car

M - why a rented car

D - cause we were driving back in a 1940 Ford, Jason had bought it and it was in Jason's garage

M - how long ago was this?

D - this was last July, probably July

M - did he ever give you any explanation why he wasn't upset about having these three cars stolen from

D - no, when he came out on Monday, he didn't even mention it. If it wasn't for somebody reading the paper and they came in they made a comment about it and I said you're kidding I wonder why he didn't mention it, cause they came in on Wednesday and he was in on Monday and the cars were stolen on Friday, Monday and Wednesday and I said you're kidding he was just in here and he didn't make mention of that to me and I was surprised he didn't say something you know cause something like that you


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 43

D - would think somebody would mention. I was very surprised to find out that he had had cars stolen

M - but Sherman wasn't working there

D - no, but Patrick was back, uh, Patrick was in Sunday night. Patrick and Gino came in on Monday

M - the cars were stolen that weekend, right

D - on Friday

M - the weekend prior to that

D - right, like the cars were stolen I believe on Friday, or Thursday night weren't they

S - Thursday night or Friday Night

D - OK, so Thursday or Friday they were stolen and then it was Sunday Patrick came in and Monday was when Gino and Patrick and his brother and sister-in-law came in

S - so, did Patrick say anything about it

D - no

S - you don't know where Patrick was staying

D - Patrick had been in the hospital

S - which hospital was he in?

D - it must have been Northern Virginia

M - do you know what for?

D - I can't remember what he told me, I asked Gino why he didn't mention it to me and he said that when you asked how Patrick was, I said fine and he was fine, I said why didn't you tell me that he was in the hospital and Gino just made a joke out of it, just because he was in the hospital he was still doing fine and that is the way he passed it off. I thought that was kind of odd that Gino wouldn't tell me that Patrick was in the hospital

M - Well, OK, this concludes the interview, the time is 1715 hours

On 08-05-76, a Maryland State Trooper was dispatched to CARRAFA's residence at 0844, arrived 0903, and cleared call at 1126 hours. This would have been the first notification that Mrs. Carrafa received relative to CARRAFA'S death.

On 08-05-76, David Knohls, Jay Knohl's brother, at 1430 hours told Bill Bogley, in Bish Thompsons Restaurant, about CARRAFA'S death and method of same. Check will be made as to who, and when, Mrs. CARRAFA notified that day.

Same is used for funerals by members of the Genovese family. 1962 Louis "Babe" Milo wake held there and in 1975 Joseph Milo wake held there. Both Milo's LCN figures. Romano's funeral home was formerly very small but it is now a large firm and same is allegedly backed by Gaetano Somma, LCN Genovese family.

Wendel Clayson, 73 Dixon Avenue, Aberdeen, Maryland, phone 301-272-3145 and Wayne Ratcliff, employed at Greir Chevrolet, Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, rented the rear portion of Gino's building for a short period of time. They did body work and operated under the business name of W & W Body Shop. Allegedly they did some work for Gino. Although unconfirmed, information has been received that Clayson stated Gino always talked about being a hit man.

Ben Addison, the owner of J & J Furniture Refinishing, located next door to Gino's, advised on Monday 8-2-76 he observed three subjects in Gino's building. They had the door opened and acted as if they belonged there. They loaded some cars on the trailer which was being pulled by the brown International truck owned by Gino. The trailer had "Horseless Carriage Carrier" written on the side. Two White males left Gino's in the truck and a black male followed them operating an antique car.

On 08-13-76 Doris Duafala, Gino's girlfriend, was questioned about whether she observed a vehicle following the truck the day (Monday) she saw it traveling East on Route #40. She stated she believed she saw a black guy operating an antique car following the truck, but she is not real certain. She further added that Gino had no black people working for him. He hated black people because one was suppose to have shot him accidently in the arm while in the Marines.

According to information received Gino was not seen at the business very often. The place was not open all the time. Up until a couple of months ago a person by the name of Pat acted as a watchman. At the beginning of the year Gino use to spend more time at the shop working. Lately more expensive cars would be in the shop. Carrafa seemed to be a nice guy. He wasn't a flashy dresser. He usually was in work clothes. He didn't seem to be the drinking type. He was friendly, but not too close.

| 08-27-76 | Information received from Wolf, Dade County, that Lederer and Roselli were well acquainted and Lederer is in the process of opening gambling casino's in various foreign countries. Lederer was allegedly involved in the murder of Richard Cain, an ex-cop who went bad and had mob connections. |

Roselli's toll records reveal that he called Fred Black on July 27, 1976 - the day before he disappeared - at 1738 hours; and he talked for four minutes.

It was also learned that a call was made to Black from Roselli's residence on 8-1-76, and a call from Roselli's residence was made to Lederer on 07-31-76 three days after Roselli's disappearance. Roselli's sister and brother-in-law deny making the calls.

It was also learned that on 08-27-76 an ex-CIA agent was called by a subject whom identified himself as Dade County Detective Robinson, and an interview was requested. This CIA agent was involved in an attempt on Castro's life. The CIA agent told the subject named Robinson that he would call him back, and the ex-agent then checked with Dade County and learned that they had no one in Washington by that name. The CIA has moved the agent and his family from their residence for safety factors.

Information received from Mrs. Caraffa that September's issue of Hemmings magazine notes two '32 Lincolns for sale on page 2859. The advertisement gives Jay Knohl's home telephone number- as opposed to Gino's Classic Cars as previously done - and the ad, in writing and paid for, had to be in prior to August 8, 1976. It is noted that Caraffa's body was recovered on 08-04-76, and no one knew of this until 08-05-76. Jay Knohl was arrested on 08-06-76 and remained in jail until at least 08-09-76. Thus Knohl, when placing the advertisement, knew that Caraffa would not be around to answer calls at Gino's Classical Cars, Inc.

DATE OBSERVATIONS/INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED/EXPENSES

In November 1967 Roselli came to Washington, D.C. where he allegedly met two attorneys who were former FBI agents, several senators, and an inspector of police who dráve him to the airport. It is speculated that the inspector was Joseph Shiman. This trip was, allegedly, for the purpose of straightening out his immigration problems and it is of note that he was never deported prior to his demise.

In December of 1967, following a Los Angeles Federal Grand Jury probe into the cheating of card players at the Friar's Club, Roselli was indicted along with Maurice Friedman, Manuel (Ricky) Jacobs, Benjamin J. Teitelbaum, and a prominent Beverly Hills physician. The indictment against the physician was later dropped.

Cpl. M. F. Alban

09-08-76 Telephone interview with Mrs. Carrafa wherein she relates that Jay Knohl has possession of her husband's 1976 Suburban station wagon, Maryland registration EPP 200, serial #CCS166F161048, title #6101813.

Mrs. Carrafa further related that her husband carried the titles to both '32 Lincolns in his attache case, as well as the title for the Suburban; and her husband carried the attache case everywhere. She feels that if her husband had received $10,000 and gone on to Los Angeles he would have kept the titles with him; however by Jay Knohl's advertising these two '32 Lincolns for sale, she assumes that he now possesses the titles and took them from Carrafa's attache case following his demise.

It was also learned that Carrafa received a traffic summons from MSP trooper for violating Article 66 1/2, Sec. 11-309 and he was due in Shady Grove Court on 08/20/76. MSP will be contacted reference circumstances surrounding this summons. Trooper believed to be Tpr. Fontaine.

Writer contacted MSP Trooper Johnny Fortune, Rockville Barracks, who stated that on 07-18-76 at 1940 hours, Sunday, he issued Carrafa a ticket for passing in a "no passing trucks" zone on Interstate 270, South of State Route 109, Summons #S3451775. Fortune could not remember anything of the incident.

Edward Levinson, former Florida and Kentucky bookmaker, is currently residing in Southern California with his wife, Betty. Levinson, a close associate of organized crime figure Meyer Lansky, has had numerous interests in various East Coast and Las Vegas casinos. Currently, his wife, Betty, is investing in a restaurant-cocktail lounge and gambling casino at Lake Elsinore.

Levinson's criminal record dates back to 1928 when he was charged with operating a gambling place in Detroit. He was repeatedly arrested for the same offense, but each time the charge was dismissed.

During the 1964 Senate Rules Committee investigation of the Bobby Baker case, Levinson claimed the privilege of the 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments. During the investigation, it was revealed that Levinson was a stockholder with Baker in the Waikiki Savings and Loan Association in Honolulu, the other members being Cliff Jones and his law partner, Louis Weiner; Edward Barrick, a part-owner in the Flamingo, Fremont, and Horseshoe Club; Mike Singer, deceased labor racketeer and former business agent of Teamster Local 626 in Los Angeles; Morris "Moe" Genser, former assistant chief investigator for the California Department of Motor Vehicles, later indicted for bribery, grand theft, extortion, and assorted other crimes; and Fred Black, Jr. Levinson also joined with Baker and Black in a stock deal which involved the Farmers and Merchants State Bank in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

In May 1967, a U. S. Grand Jury in Las Vegas returned an indictment of income tax evasion against Levinson; Edward Torres, former vice president of the Fremont Hotel; and Paul Weyerman and Cornelius Hurlay, former stockholders and employees of the Fremont Hotel.

In March 1968, Levinson pled nolo contendere to the "skimming" charges, admitting that he had "willfully aided and assisted in the preparation of false corporate tax returns for the fiscal year ending in 1963", and was fined $5,000.

In 1967, a group of organized crime figures attempted to defraud the Chase Manhattan Bank of almost $2 million, using the Exchange Bank of Geneva, Switzerland as a cover. The bank was owned by a group of Americans, including several prominent businessmen, as well as Levinson and Benjamin Siegelbaum. The investigation revealed that the Swiss bank had served as a "laundry shop" for Mafia money for years.

On March 1, 1974, Levinson's wife, Betty, invested approximately $90,000 as a stockholder in Lake Elsinore Sands, Inc., a "restaurant, cocktail lounge, and gambling casino" at Lake Elsinore. The officers of Lake Elsinore Sands, Inc., are Jack Barenfeld, President, who was arrested in 1934 for suspicion of murder; and Carl Braverman, Vice President and Treasurer, who was arrested in West Virginia in 1927 for larceny and again in New York in 1943 for untrue advertising. Barenfeld and Braverman are also partners in B & B Ltd.

Levinson then moved to Newport, Kentucky, where he operated the Flamingo Club, a casino, along with Las Vegas racketeer Irving "Nig" Devine. In 1951, he moved to Miami Beach, where he operated the bookmaking concession at the San Souci Hotel. Levinson was chased out of Miami in 1951 by the Kefauver Committee, so he ventured to Las Vegas and became part-owner in the Sands Hotel, which was being operated for Joseph "Doc" Stacher, a Meyer Lansky lieutenant.

By 1955, Levinson, having acquired interests in the Flamingo and Dunes hotels, was ready to give them all up for his coming involvement in Doc Stacher's Fremont Hotel. At that same time, he also acquired a major interest in the Horseshoe Club. (By late 1963, he was the largest single stockholder in the Fremont Hotel and in the Horseshoe.)

He became involved in the establishment of the Bank of World Commerce, Ltd., which incorporated in 1961 under British law in Nassau. Ed Levinson and Cliff "Big Juice" Jones, former Nevada Lieutenant Governor, were listed as stockholders, with the directors of the bank being Levinson; Benjamin Sigelbaum, a reported bagman for Meyer Lansky; Irving Devine; and John Pullman. Reportedly, the Bank of World Commerce served as a "laundromat" for syndicate cash by allowing money to flow into the bank only to return to the United States from Nassau in the form of loans for everything from homes for gangsters to savings and loan associations around the country.

During the 1960's Levinson became associated with several political figures. No only did he aid financially troubled Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa, but he became a partner in the Serv-U Vending Corporation with Bobby Baker, then secretary to the Democratic Majority Leader of the United States Senate; Fred Black, Jr., a Washington lobbyist for North American Aviation Company; and Benjamin Siegelbaum. This company provided vending machines for companies working on government contracts and was substituted for a firm that had handled North American Aviation's vending business for years, despite the fact that Serv-U had no employees, vending machines, or experience.

In 1962, Levinson, along with Benjamin Sigelbaum, appeared to be involved in Airway Hotel, Inc., the hotel corporation which created the Intenational Airport Hotel on Century Boulevard in Los Angeles.

It appears that Riverside County may be in for several changes due to influence by outside elements. Since Levinson entered the area, Lake Elsinore has amended its ordinance to allow the Lake Elsinore Sands to serve liquor in its card room. Robert Willis Wilson, another newcomer to Riverside County, has proposed an initiative to legalize gambling. (For further information, see June 1974 Criminal Information Bulletin). With the new gambling interests in Riverside County, it may in time become the Las Vegas of California.

Dade County Homicide advises that one Samuel Ray Calabrese, AKA Whole, W/M, 02-22-33, FBI #577 794 Jl, S.S. #554-42-0214, may have information relative to the Roselli homicide.

On 12-20-76 NYCPD, Det. Scarpati, (212) 946-3311, sent a TTY to this jurisdiction reference ascertaining whether one William Thompson, 15221 Manor Lake Drive, Wheaton, Maryland purchased a certain shotgun from the Sportsman Shop in Bethesda, Maryland; and whether Thompson knew Jay Knohl. Officer Packard, Wheaton-Glenmont, determined that Thompson purchased two shotguns and sold both about 1 1/2 years ago to David Knohl; and Thompson understood that the shotguns had been given to Jay Knohl. Thompson further stated that he knew Gino Carrafa.

Vehicle parked at Thompson residence had Maryland vanity tag PEACE, and same listed to Bish Thompson's Restaurant, 7935 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland.

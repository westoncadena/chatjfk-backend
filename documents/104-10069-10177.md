UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

# Memorandum

TO: Director, Domestic Contact Service

ATTN: OSS (LGrant)

FROM: Chief, Miami Field Office

SUBJECT: Gordon Cooper and Associates

REF: COA(S) 322/16265-72

1. On 22 June 1972 we met at some length with Leroy Gordon Cooper: President, Gordon Cooper and Associates, Hangar One, Opa-Locka Airport, Opa-Locka, Florida. A peripheral benefit of this meeting was the acquisition of additional information concerning Gordon Cooper and Associates (GCA) which may have a bearing on the referenced COA(S) and possibly on future clandestine interest in the organization.

2. GCA was formed roughly two years ago as an aerospace and airline management consultant firm. Cooper stated that the organization may be disbanded shortly because of disagreements between Cooper and one of his partners, Mel Adler. Adler supposedly is a stock manipulator who, Cooper feels, comes close to operating outside the law and therefore not the type of person with whom Cooper desires to associate. Adler has refused to sell his stock in GCA and to disassociate himself with GCA so the firm will probably be allowed to simply run out of business. GCA will be replaced with Gordon Cooper Consultants Corporation which will be incorporated either in Nevada or the Republic of Panama. The activities will remain the same and a Miami office will be maintained.

3. In addition to activities within his own firm, Cooper is a member of the Board of Directors of Casino Management International (CMI), Grand Cayman Island. CMI is control and operated by Edward (fnu) Cellini, Robert (fnu) Cellini, and Dino (fnu) Cellini and its activities center around the establishment and operation of gambling casinos throughout the world. Cooper claims that he has assured himself that CMI operates within the limits of US laws even though they are headquartered in Grand Cayman and that the Cellini brothers, all US citizens, are law abiding businessmen operating a legitimate business. He claims that there is disclosure of all personnel connected with the organization, and that Cooper's policy is maintained with the US Internal Revenue Service completely with the FBI. Cooper frankly stated that he would use the use of his name and his ability to capitalize on and use his astronaut days to introduce CMI to individuals of government in countries throughout the world.

4. Cooper has recently been instrumental in the establishment of a casino in Istanbul, Turkey, and he is currently assisting in the negotiations ions for the establishment of additional casinos in Ankara and Izmir. CHI now operates a casino in Yugoslavia and is bidding on the establishment of an additional one in a Yugoslav location which Cooper cannot recall. In conjunction with CMI, Cooper is working on the establishment of a travel club which would, in addition to offering tour packages to various parts of the world, offer junkete to gambling casinos. CHI would fund the travel expenses of those individuals who could be counted upon to gamble heavily at CHI casinos. As an aside, Cooper mentioned that CAI has "fantastic" files on individuals in all paris of the world who are known to be habitual gamblers. These files include their spending habits, incoze and outgo and general financial situation.

5. The Haitian airline passibility as reported in referent has no connection with CMI.. Cooper is very interested in the project, is pursuing it personally and expects to have soon definite word from the Government of Kaiti after a trip to Baith within the next weak or two. If the deal reaches, fruivien, Copper will be closely associated in Haiti with one Norman Dupree, a Canadian citizen who allegedly is the foxair president of the telephone compony in Haiti and who has extrectly close ties with the Haitian goverment.

6. Cooper reiterated and emphasised his willingness to cooperate with the Agency in whatever conne er conne: would be asst appropriate. He said that he felt felt very strongly about such cooperation and that we should feel at complete liberty to appresch him porserally at any time on any matter of interest to CIA. Bio data is being forwarded,

MEMORANDUM FOR LIEUTENANT GENERAL BRENT SCOWCROFT
THE WHITE HOUSE

Subject: Senate Select Committee Request
for Documents on the Cabinet
Committee to Combat Terrorism

The Department of State has been asked by the Senate Select Committee investigating intelligence to provide information on the structure and functions of the Cabinet Committee to Combat Terrorism and its Working Group. Because all of the basic documents concerning the CCT are Presidential, we are forwarding them to you for review for possible release to the Senate Committee.

The relevant documents are:

- Memorandum for the President from Secretary William P. Rogers on September. 18, 1972 (the report referred to in the President's Memorandum of September 25, 1972);

- Memorandum for the Secretary from President Richard M. Nixon on September 25, 1972; and

- Six reports to the President from the Chairman of the Cabinet Committee to Combat Terrorism (the Secretary of State).

These documents set forth the basic structure and functions of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group.

There are many functions of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group discussed in the reports to the President other than the intelligence function being investigated by the Senate Select Committee. We do not see any need for the discussion of these other functions to be withheld from the SSC.

Begin Statement (CONFIDENTIAL):

With the exception of a weekly publication by the CIA on international terrorism, requested by the Cabinet Committee on January 1, 1973, the intelligence functions of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group are handled through established interagency channels. The agencies most active in generation and coordination of terrorism information for the Working Group are the CIA, the FBI, NSA, DOD, the Secret Service, the Department of Treasury and the State Department.

- 3.-

These Working Group agencies set their own priorities and parameters concerning intelligence on terrorism matters. From time to time the CIA requests comments from the Working Group on its weekly terrorism reports.

The organization of the Cabinet Committee is delineated in the President's memorandum of September 25, 1972. The Working Group is composed of senior representatives of the ten agencies on the Cabinet Committee and representatives of the following agencies: Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Energy Research and Development Administration, Federal Protective Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, Metropolitan Police Department, National Security Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Management and Budget, and the United States Information Agency. These additional agencies were invited to participate in the Working Group by the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Coordinator for Combatting Terrorism (S/CCT), in his capacity as Chairman of the Working Group.

Under the Working Group there is one formal subgroup, the Behavioral Science Resource Group (BSRG), which is composed of behavioral science experts from the State Department, the CIA, the FBI and USIA. The State Department member chairs BSRG. The Resource Group

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to memorandum of K. William O'Connor,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, to Mr. John Mintz, Legal
Counsel Division of this Eureau, dated June 26, 1975, captioned "DAG
Inquiry Re Communication by Former AAG Doar to FBI Regarding
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party Delegation."

Regarding your request contained in referenced communication
for the Bureau to locate and furnish certain documents, it is my under-
standing that you are in possession of the documents requested.

In response to your request that we furnish our observations
concerning the making of the documents available to former Assistant
Attorney General John Doar, may I suggest that this raises an issue
which has been discussed in the past by the Bureau and the Department
and other Government agencies. This issue to my knowledge has not
been resolved. That issue is whether a former employee should be
allowed access to documents in the Government's possession to refresh
his recollection for possible testimony before the Senate Select Committee.
It is this Eureau's position that such documents should not be made
available for the aforementioned purpose, and in those instances where
a former employee cannot respond accurately to the question of the Senate
Select Committee or any other Congressional investigative body, the
Committee or Congressional body can be referred to the appropriate
bureau or agency which will, if appropriate, furnish the necessary
information. I am sure you will understand our concern in this regard
insofar as setting a precedent which might serve for future requests of
this nature.

NOTE: According to referenced communication, Mr. Doar requested to review a communication he caused to be sent while in the Department asking for information concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party Delegation. The Deputy Attorney General had asked that the documentation concerning the request and our response be located and furnished to him. The Department also asked our views as to whether he should be given access to or delivered the documents for the purpose of refreshing Doar's recollection.

JUN 2 6 1975

TO: John Mintz
Legal Counsel Division
Federal Bureau of Investigation

FROM: K. William O'Connor
Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination

SUBJECT: DAG Inquiry Re Communication by Former AAG Doar
to FBI Regarding Mississippi Freedom Democratic
Party Delegation

(1) The DAG has asked me to request that the Bureau make
a file check to determine what, if any, documents may be found
in FBI files relating to a request made by Mr. Doar in August
1964 for information and Bureau action regarding members of the
subject delegation. It is our understanding that Mr. Doar
requested certain information from the FBI regarding this dele-
gation in mid-August 1964; and that some information was delivered
to the DOJ (either to Mr. Doar or then DAG Katzenbach) shortly
thereafter, in the latter part of August 1964.

(2) It is possible that Mr. Doar may be asked about these
matters in connection with the Senate Select Committee inquiry
(reference Appendix D, Item 7, 5/14/75 SSC request). The DAG
has also asked that, after such documentation as may be developed
under (1) above has been located, the Bureau furnish to him its
view as to the access/delivery to Mr. Doar of such documentation
for the purpose of refreshing his recollection.

(3) An expeditious response to this request will be
appreciated.

SUBJECT: UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

By letter dated 5/14/75, with attached appendices, the SSC requested certain information and documents from the FBI.

Appendix C, Item number 10, requested all memoranda and other materials relating to the elimination of the Liaison Section of the FBI in 1970 and its reestablishment in late 1972.

Among the enclosures to our letter to the Attorney General (AG), dated 6/13/75, being proposed for forwarding to the Committee is E. S. Miller memorandum to Mr. Felt, 7/14/72. On page 2 there is information that "our close association with the Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials has resulted in that agency providing support in some of our most delicate intelligence operations looking to the identification of illegal hostile intelligence activities in this country." This could possibly be construed to include opening of mail. It is to be noted that opening of mail by FBI is the subject of a separate SSC request and future correspondence with the SSC, through the AG, will address itself to this subject. Former Chief Postal Inspector Henry B. Montague, with whom we have had extensive dealings in the past, is scheduled to appear before the full SSC on 6/12/75 and it is expected that he will be questioned about possible FBI participation in mail openings.

This morning (7/2/75) Michael Epstein, Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Member, advised SA Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel Division, that he, Epstein, is to interview SA John R. Borys and former Assistant Director Ivan Conrad at 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., respectively, Monday, 7/7/75. Borys is assigned to WFO and Conrad resides 1307 Capulet Court, McLean, Virginia 22101, unlisted telephone number 356-7590. Interviews are to concern the former FBI investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.

These are the latest in a series of interviews regarding the King case being conducted by the SSC Staff of present and former SAs. It is believed that Borys and Conrad should be released from their secrecy agreements to enable them to be interviewed which is the same procedure which we have been taking with the others who have been interviewed. The release from the agreement which we'are recommending will, of course, be conditional that the interview relate only to the King matter.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Borys and Conrad be released from their secrecy agreement in order to be interviewed, but only relating to the King case. On approval, Legal Counsel Division will advise them of the release and invite them to consult with the Legal Counsel Division early a.m. 7/7/75 in preparation for the interviews.

On the evening of 6/27/75, Mr. K. William O'Connor of the Department of Justice furnished to Mr. Paul Daly of the Legal Counsel Division the attached copy of a draft letter to the Attorney General (AG) from Senators Church and Tower along with notifications concerning certain matters currently under investigation by the SSC which relate to the FBI as well as to the Department of Justice.

The latest request which is identified as a draft is broken down into three sections identified as: I. Issues, II. Areas of General Inquiry, and III. Case Studies.

## I. Issues

The SSC's inquiry into the intelligence and counter- intelligence activities of the FBI is designed to examine fundamental issues which bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation and administrative organization and procedure. As a means of examining the issues in the context of actual FBI intelligence operations, the Committee intends to study certain specific topics, some of which are general in nature and others of which involve specific cases, programs or techniques. The specific issues are set out in the attachment under section I. A-F.

## II. Areas of General Inquiry

The following contains descriptions of the general areas of inquiry into which the Committee intends to engage:

In connection with another Senstudy matter, Section Chief William O. Cregar had a meeting with Mr. John Elliff who is Chief of the Task Force for the SSC on the morning of 6/30/75. Elliff apologized for the submission of the 6/25/75 draft letter, saying it was forced upon the Committee by the White House. According to Elliff, the SSC has been aware that much of the information requested from the Intelligence Community was being held up by the White House until such time as the SSC identified specific abuses it was interested in investigating. As a result, the attached draft was put together by the SSC to break the logjam. Elliff admitted that much of the information requested in the 6/25/75 draft letter was embodied in the request of 5/14/75. For this reason, Elliff advised he contacted Mr. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Department of Justice, on the morning of 6/30/75 to request a meeting between himself, O'Connor, and Messrs Wannall, Mintz and Cregar. The purpose of the meeting would be to allow Elliff to clarify the draft letter of 6/25/75.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Enclosed with this letter are notifications concerning certain matters currently under investigation by the Select Committee which relate to government entities under your jurisdiction.

These notifications are submitted pursuant to an agreement between the Committee, the various intelligence entities, and the White House. Pursuant to that agreement, the various entities in the Executive Branch have agreed not only to make available the pertinent witnesses, but also to submit in response all information and material which they possess that is relevant to the areas and cases which the Committee wishes to investigate. The response should include all relevant underlying documentation and other information, including documents which may not have come to the Committee's attention and which the Committee has not specifically requested, and all material relating to any prior Executive Branch inquiry into the matter. In addition, we would welcome a current analysis of the particular questions raised by the Committee and any other observations on the subject that you believe would be helpful.

We welcome the promise of cooperation and full disclosure that underlies that agreement. Success in fulfilling the full disclosure policy contained in the agreement is indispensible to the Committee's analysis and to the formulation of our ultimate findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

Within the Committee mandate, contained in S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the intelligence community which we are required to investigate and study in order to determine the facts and ultimately to decide whether to make recommendations for legislative or other changes. They are:

1. The structure; performance, and utility of government operations with respect to intelligence activities;

2. Whether certain policies or practices are or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise improper;

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive duplication or inadequate coordination.between and among intelligence agencies and, more generally, the efficiency of intelligence activities; and

4. Whether there has or has not been adequate internal and external control and oversight over the policies and practices of intelligence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these fundamental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways. First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as instruments of government policy, giving attention to the authority for particular functions, the problems which intelligence activities are designed to solve, the procedures by which intelligence activities are and have been proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated, the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in depth certain specific subjects within the broad topics of investigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion of other cases that would give added insight into intelligence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the scope contained in the more general questions.

The annexed notifications spell these matters out in greater detail. In addition, they ask certain specific questions, set forth certain previously requested documents not yet received, request additional documents, and, in some cases, ask for the names and present addresses of persons who have held certain

* These specific requests are not, of course, intended to limit the agreement to come forward with all relevant information and material, including documents, whether or not they have been brought to the Committee's attention or have been specifically requested by the Committee.

positions. Where appropriate, the subject's description indicates, pursuant to the agreed Outline for Inquiry Procedures, the matter primarily concerns allegations of abuse or other controversial specific matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred. Finally, the notifications indicate the name(s) of the staff members(s) who, in addition to the Committee's senior staff, will be responsible for the particular matters.

The Committee, in the course of the next few months, will undertake other subjects for investigation as its work proceeds and will notify you as appropriate.

We look forward to your cooperation in these matters.

# FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
(INCLUDING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE)

I. Issues

The Committee's inquiry into the intelligence and counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation and administrative organization and procedure. The Committee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate objectives in conformity with the rule of law. Among the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

A. What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities? Should the FBI's authority be clarified or revised or incorporated in a comprehensive statutory charter?

B. What limitations are placed on FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities by the Constitution and laws of the United States? Should these limitations be clarified or revised?

C. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities? Should these objectives be modified?.

D. How have the intelligence and counterintelligence activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated with other agencies of government? Should these procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques of intelligence gathering and dissemination and counterintelligence operations used by the FBI? Under what conditions and through what procedures should these methods and techniques be used in the future?

F. What have been and should be the mechanisms for internal and external policy-making, control, and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter- intelligence activities?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

As a means of examining the above issues in the context of actual FBI intelligence operations, the Committee intends to study certain specific topics, some of which are general in nature, and others of which involve specific cases, programs or techniques. Part II, below, contains descriptions of the general areas into which the Committee: intends to inquire. Part III contains descriptions of the specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions specifically indicate whether the investigation may concentrate on specific allegations of possible abuses or other controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred. In addition to the topics described below, additional areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the Committee's work.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

II. Areas of General Inquiry

A. Legal Authority for FBI Intelligence and Counter-intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities. There may be serious question as to the adequacy of the present legislative framework for the FBI's functions in these fields. Current statutes authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law enforcement functions, but they do not specifically authorize intelligence or counterintelligence activities. Therefore, the Committee seeks to determine whether the FBI's authority should be clarified, revised, or incorporated in a comprehensive statutory charter.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein

B. Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelligence Division

The Committee is investigating the structure and operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Division. Proposals have been made that the national security intelligence and counterintelligence functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's criminal investigative activities. Further recommendations have been advanced for improved coordination between the FBI and other intelligence agencies, for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities by the Attorney General or an independent board, and for clearer standards and procedures for FBI activities in this area. Therefore, the Committee desires complete information on the operating practices and procedures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the field office activities supervised by the Intelligence Division.

NW 88326 Docld:32989611 Page 32


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following specific areas:

1.  FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature and purpose of FBI intelligence operations directed at foreign intelligence activities and subversive or extremist activities within the United States. It has been alleged that the scope of FBI intelligence investigations is too broad and has extended to legitimate political activities. Consequently, the Committee must examine how the FBI's responsibilities have been defined.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein

2.  The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community.

The Committee seeks to determine what have been the policies and procedures for coordination between the FBI and other agencies in the U. S. intelligence community. There have been occasions in the past where friction between the FBI and other agencies has produced serious dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence community. The purpose of this inquiry is to evaluate the adequacy of past and present coordinating mechanisms.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

3. FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of FBI counterintelligence operations directed at foreign intelligence activities within the United States or at any other hostile foreign-related activities within the United States. Since FBI operations to "counter" these activities go beyond intelligence collection, the Committee must consider whether such practices require statutory authorization. The impact of counterintelligence operations on United States foreign relations will also be considered.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Loch Johnson
Barbara Banoff

4. Inspection Division Investigations

The Committee is examining the relationship of the FBI Inspection Division to FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities. This includes both regular Inspection Division reviews of Intelligence Division and field office functions and specific investigations of allegations of improper conduct in connection with FBI intelligence activities.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

# 5. FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local Law Enforcement Agencies

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of the relationships between FBI intelligence activities and state and local law enforcement agencies. This subject involves the delicate balance between the necessary centralization of certain law enforcement activities and the Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of general law enforcement responsibility. It is necessary for the Committee to evaluate the centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as the FBI's role as a check on local law enforcement abuses.

5. How have specific uses of the activity been initiated and approved?

6. How have the targets for the activity been selected?

7. What have been the criteria for large selection?

8. How has the intelligence which is collected been used?

9. To whom has the intelligence collected been disseminated?

10. What has been the basis for any dissemination with respect to each recipient?

11. How has the activity been coordinated with other intelligence agencies?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

12. What have been the effects of this coordination?

13. To what extent has each of the foregoing been compatible with the legal authority for and the purposes of the activity?

14. By what means has the activity been monitored, controlled and administered?

15. What are the potential abuses to which the activity .. may lead?

16. To what abuses has the activity led?

17. What steps have been taken to investigate such abuses?

18. What steps have been taken to avoid such abuses?

19. What have been the costs and utility of the activity?

In some instances, the specific questions set forth below may appear to repeat some of the general questions. The purpose in such cases is simply to clarify the application of the general question to the specific case. Except where inapplicable by their terms, all general questions relate to each specific case.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

# Electronic Surveillance

The Committee is examining all forms of electronic interception of communications including wiretapping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual electronic surveillance interception of video and data communications, local monitoring devices, and all other forms of electronic or technical monitoring. The Committce's general questions apply to each of the techniques listed above, as well as to the matters set forth in the following specific cases.

1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the Attorney General should have the authority to authorize electronic surveillance for certain purposes without a prior judicial warrant. This power has been exercised by succeeding Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit directive of the President. The Supreme Court has ruled that this power does not extend to purely domestic matters, but the remaining scope of the Attorney General's authority remains undefined by the Supreme Court.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

a. What is the scope and basis of the claim of Executive authority to conduct warrant- less electronic surveillance?

b. What have been the procedures for consideration and approval of requests for warrantless electronic surveillance authorized by the Attorney General?

c. What are the specific disadvantages of the judicial warrant requirement for those electronic surveillances which have been authorized by the Attorney General?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

d. Does the Fourth Amendment permit the issuance of judicial warrants for electronic surveillance on grounds other than ordinary probable cause where national security intelligence purposes are advanced to justify the surveillance?

e. To what extent are the specific procedures of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968 inappropriate for electronic surveillance conducted for national security intelligence purposes?

Documents

The Committee requests the following additional documents bearing on the questions stated above:

a. All written justifications for the specific authorizations by the Attorney General for warrantless electronic surveillance from January 1, 1960, until the present.

b. All documents reflecting the denial by the Attorney General of specific requests for warrantless electronic surveillance from January 1, 1960, until the present.

c. Committee staff access to information contained in the impounded documents, depositions, and other materials in all pending civil suits which involve warrantless electronic surveillance and in which the Committee has received the consent of the plaintiffs for such access.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mike Epstein

# Clandestine Informant Activities

The Committee is examining all aspects of the FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover personnel and the techniques employed by such persons. Although informants are the single most productive source of intelligence information, the difficulties of controlling their activities may increase the possibility of improper conduct. The use of informants to infiltrate organizations also may pose dangers to the right of associational privacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement or other safeguards for the use of informants. The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as well as the contributions of informants to the accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant activities with respect to several particular situations and cases. This investigation may involve specific allegations of abuse or controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry covers the general circumstances surrounding the following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;

b. Kent State;

c. New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

e. United States v. Briggs (Camden);

f. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

g. United States v. Marshall (Seattle).

Additional cases may also be examined.

In addition to the above cases, the Committee is examining the role of FBI informants in providing information to the FBI concerning members of the following organizations:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

a. Ku Klux Klan;

b. Students for a Democratic Society;

c. Weathermen;

d. Black Panther Party;

e. Communist. Party USA;

f. W.E.B. DuBois Clubs.

Additional studies of informant activities with respect to members of other organizations may be formulated.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

1. With respect to both categories of cases listed above, what allegations, whether unfounded or not, of improper, illegal, unethical, or provocative conduct by FBI informants have been made in connection with these situations or groups?

2. What measures has the FBI taken to investigate such allegations of misconduct and to prevent such alleged misconduct from taking place in the future?

3. What instructions has the FBI given to its informants with respect to possible improper, illegal, unethical, or provocative conduct?

4. What has been the largest number of informants, sources, and undercover personnel in use at any one time during each year from 1960 until the present in connection with security, intelligence, and counterintelligence matters, cases, and programs?

5. What has been the annual total amount of funds (including reimbursement for expenses) paid to informants and sources for each year from 1960 until the present?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

6. What limits, if any, have been placed on the type of information which informants have been intrusted to report back to the FBI?

7. What have been the annual percentage of potential informants who became paid informants in connection with security, intelligence, and counterintelligence matters, cases, and programs from 1960 until the present?

Documents

Please provide a summary of ten cases (for each of the following categories) where the FBI's use of informants, sources, or undercover personnel resulted in:

1. the conviction of an espionage agent of a foreign government.

2. the prevention of the theft of national security information.

3. the prevention of sabotage.

4. the prevention of an act of violence.

5. the prevention of the carrying out of a conspiracy to overthrow the government.

6. any other successful preventive actions in furtherance of the FBI's national security responsibilities.

G. "Notional" Organizations

The Committee is examining the FBI's alleged creation of the support for "notional" organizations for intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Although it may rely upon informants and other clandestine operatives, this alleged practice is sufficiently novel to require separate attention.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

1. What groups, organizations, movements, or other associations has the FBI caused directly or indirectly to be formed or created for intelligence or counterintelligence purposes? Please provide a complete list from January 1, 1960, to the present.

2. What groups, organizations, movements, or other associations has the FBI supported financially or materially? Please provide a complete list from January 1, 1960, to the present.

3. In which cases has the FBI supported or created such organizations in coordination or cooperation with other agencies?

4. How have the presence of such "notional" organizations affected the public's perception of the movements of which they form a part?

5. How have any FBI programs for the creation and support of such groups been coordinated with any similar programs undertaken by the CIA or other U.S. intelligence agencies?

# The "Huston Plan"

The Committee is examining the FBI's role in the disposition of the report of the Interagency Committee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc) in 1970. This report as submitted to the President included certain options which were specifically identified as "illegal". It purported to represent the joint recommendations of all members of the U. S. intelligence community, but FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover disagreed in a series of footnotes. The serious consideration given to such allegedly illegal proposals gives this case the utmost significance for the Committee's understanding of the risks of uncontrolled intelligence activity. This case may involve specific allegations of abuse and controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

1 - Mr. L. F. Schwartz

On 6/26/75 James J. Angleton, former Chief, Counterintelligence Operations, Central Intelligence Agency, telephonically furnished the following information to SA L. F. Schwartz.

Angleton recently testified under oath before three Senators and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC). He appeared without counsel. During his testimony, Angleton was asked numerous questions concerning his knowledge of Israeli capabilities to conduct intelligence collection in the United States. Among the questions asked Angleton were questions bearing on Israeli efforts to gather nuclear information in the United States. Angleton indicated that the SSC apparently is aware of Angleton's past close relationship with the Israelis, and Angleton feels that the questions directed to him by the SSC may be related to information provided to the Committee by correspondent Tad Szulc who, according to Angleton, is writing an article concerning Angleton's relationship with the Israelis for Penthouse Magazine. Angleton understands that Szulc has either testified or has been interviewed by the SSC.

Angleton stated that he avoided any direct answers on the above questions by stating that any knowledge he might have would be secondhand and fragmentary. He advised the SSC that such questions might more properly be directed to the FBI. When asked who in the Bureau might be knowledgeable in this.

CONFIDENTIAL SECRET

area, Angleton replied that he did not know but that he believed the current senior Bureau official concerned with operational matters to be Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams.

In addition, Angleton advised that certain questions he was asked dealt with alleged Soviet attempts to infiltrate the CIA and other agencies. Again, Angleton avoided a direct answer and indicated that the FBI would be the appropriate agency to direct such questions to. Finally, Angleton commented that in the event the Bureau thought it desirable he would be happy to personally brief the Director or other appropriate Bureau official concerning his testimony. He commented that he has not been asked to, nor has he offered to, brief William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, concerning his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  We are checking for any available information in files concerning Israeli intelligence collection capabilities in the United States. Results will be summarized in separate memorandum.

2. It is not believed appropriate to request Angleton to brief the Director or other Bureau official concerning his testimony, particularly since Angleton has not seen fit to brief his former superiors at CIA. A request by the Bureau for a briefing by Angleton might be misconstrued if it were to come to the attention of Colby or other CIA officials.

## RE: CONTACT OF MR. HARRY EUGENE SCHAFER
AND HIS SPOUSE, MRS. JILL D. SCHAFER,
WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SSC

Mr. Harry Eugene Schafer and his spouse, Mrs. Jill D. Schafer, served as confidential informants of the FBI until March, 1975. Immediately prior to that date they were identified as sources of the FBI by Joseph Alfred Burton, a former confidential informant of the FBI. Since his discontinuance as an FBI source in July, 1974, Burton has been publicly attacking the FBI for alleged improprieties and illegal activities. Burton's charges are distorted and in some instances false.

On May 21, 1975, Mr. and Mrs. Schafer made available to our New Orleans Office a copy of a letter addressed to then dated May 14, 1975, signed by Michael T. Epstein, Counsel, of the SSC. In this letter Mr. Epstein requested the Schafers telephone his collect to discuss some natters relating to the current SSC inquiry.

Subsequently, Mr. and Mrs. Schafer voluntarily contacted the New Orleans Office of the FBI to advise that at the invitation of Mr. Epstein they had traveled to Washington, D. C., on June 7, 1975, to converse with representatives of the SSC. Mr. and Mrs. Schafer indicated Mr. Epstein had offered to reimburse them for the expenses of this travel. The Schafers advised that upon their arrival in Washington, D. C., at the appointed hour, they went to Mr. Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein introduced himself and two colleagues, a male named Marshal Elliott, described as a representative of Senator Schweiker, and Mary De Oreo, a female researcher.

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: CONTACT OF MR. AND MRS. SCHAFER WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF SSC

According to the Schafers, Mr. Epstein began the interview with the Schafers by stating the purpose of the Senate Committee and why the Schafers were asked to Washington, D. C. Mr. Epstein stated that the Committee was trying to develop information on what the U. S. intelligence agencies have been doing, what changes in these agencies are needed and "where mistakes might have happened."

The Schafors advised they requested Mr. Epstein to ask them specific questions. He asked them what was the entire period of time of the Schafers' relationship with the FBI and if they were still associated with the Dureau. Mr. Schafer told Mr. Epstein that he was not going to admit any association with the FBI at this point and the reply seemed to groatly upset Mir. Epstein. He asked the Schafers why they had come to Washington, D. C. The Schafers replied they wanted to establish some groundwork for any relationship with the Senate Committcc. Mr. Epstein attempted to have the Schafers relate their activitics in behalf of the FBI, Mr. Schafer advised they refused to comply due to Mr. Epstein's manner and presentation. The Schafers stated they received the definite impression that Mr. Epstein and his colleagues expected to hear an afternoon of interesting stories and anecdotes.

Mrs. Schafer told Mr. Epstein that they had done nothing wrong, illegal, immoral or unethical in their "movement" activities and they were proud of thoir contributions to the nation's internal security. The Schafers related they enjoyed a happy relationship with the FBI and they knew of nothing questionable or unprofessional regarding the Bureau's handling of their information. The Schafors said they made it clear that they would be happy to tell the SSC these things; however, since they were not reassured by Mr. Epstein, and were in fact put off by his manner and his colleagues' brusque reactions, they would not furnish anything further to Mr. Epstein. The Schafers stated that short of appearing before the Senate Committee, they wanted to be left alone.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: CONTACT OF MR. AND MRS. SCHAFER WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF SEC

According to the Schafers, Mr. Epstein and his
colleagues gave the clear impression that they were disappointed
and annoyed with the Schafers' reluctance to tell them anything.
Mr. Epstein asked if the Schafers wa wanted to talk to any of
the Senators and the Schafers stated they would be willing
to speak to Senator Goldwater; however, Mr. Epstein mado no
specific arrangements other than to check with Charlie Lombard,
Goldwater's representative. Mr. Epstein did not say if the
Schafers would be subpoenaed; nor were any fira arrangements
made about reimbursing them for their expenses. According to
the Schafers, the meeting broke up rather abruptly and
Mr. Epstein's colleagues left without saying good-by.

The Schafors stated they made an effort to be
friendly, co cooperative and amenablo to Mr. Epotein and his
colleagues, and they made a good faith gesture in appearing
before Mr. Epstein in Washington, D. C.

NOTE:

The Schafers, as paid informants, furnished
information from October, 1969, until March, 1975, to the
Bureau. Information in this LHM was contained in
New Orleans teletype to the Director, dated June 11, 1975.
Several personal statements made by the Schafers, such as
"bearded hippy" in reference to one of Epstein's colleagues,
were not included in the LHM as this type of information
is not fully germane and our reporting of it might be
inferred as our being prejudicial.

At the direction of Bureau teletype 6-9-75, San Francisco on 6-11-75, advised Todd of above and that he was released from the applicable employee secrecy agreement for the purpose of the Staff interview.

By letter dated June 11, 1975, Mr. Todd said the interview "may involve information disseminated to other Government agencies under security classification and may touch on foreign policy as well."

Legal Counsel to Adams, Memo
Re: SENSTUDY 75

We have prepared an airtel to San Francisco with an enclosed letter for Mr. Todd in response to his request. We are having the San Francisco Office hand deliver the letter so that any questions he may have can be answered.

We have not regarded requests for interviews as "demands" within the meaning of 28 CFR 16.22; therefore, no release from the Department is necessary.

Regarding his request for access to Bureau files, we have not had former employees make this request previously. Our position should be that they not have access but rather rely on their recollection. If they cannot answer a specific question, the Committee can be referred to the Bureau.

RECOMMENDATION:

Attached Airtel with enclosed letter to Mr. Todd be approved and sent.

Mr. Clarence M. Kelley
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

On this date Supervisor Berryman of the San Francisco Office read to me a teletype to the effect the Bureau had approved a secrecy release for me to respond to questions from Senate investigator Lester B. Seidel in connection with a Senate Select Committee on Internal Security investigation of the CoIntelPro as it related to the Black Panther Party. A copy of a letter from me to Mr. Seidel has been furnished to the Bureau previously.

At the time I was designated supervisor of the squad handling internal security investigations of the Black Panther Party (BPP), the BPP was international in scope; Eldridge Cleaver and others had been granted asylum in Algeria; the BPP had support and/or branches in France, Germany, Scandinavia and China. Aspects of the counter intelligence program approved by the Bureau of which I am aware were directed against some BPP foreign operations. Thus, interrogation by the Senate investigator may involve information disseminated to other government agencies under security classification and may touch on foreign policy as well.

Therefore, prior to furnishing information obtained in an official capacity to Mr. Seidel, who according to the Bureau's teletype will be in San Francisco in about two weeks, I would like written confirmation of the release which was furnished me orally, preferably an official document covering any secrecy agreement made with the Bureau as well as releasing me from the provisions of any applicable executive orders which preclude disclosure of official information without approval of the Attorney General or an authorized Departmental officer. I would also appreciate being advised if there is any limitation on the scope of the material which I may release.

Since the Bureau's teletype also approved a secrecy release for current SAC Charles Bates, this presupposes he will be authorized to furnish Mr. Seidel with the contents of files if Mr. Seidel so requests. Therefore, I would also appreciate advice as to whether I will be permitted to refresh my recollection by reviewing official files prior to or during the interview with Mr. Seidel.

Sincerely yours,

David E. Todd
Retired Special Agent

On 6/27/75 James J. Angleton, former Chief,
Counter Intelligence Operations, Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), telephonically advised SA L. F. Schwartz
that he has been in contact with Herbert Itkin, former
Bureau Criminal Informant who also had a relationship
with CIA. Angleton advised that Itkin is being inter-
viewed today at a local hotel by a Mr. Shea from the
Senate Select Committee.

Itkin was successfully operated as a Top Echelon
Criminal Informant from April, 1963, until February, 1968,
when he was discontinued. He has testified in a number
of Bureau cases and his past relationship with CIA and
the Bureau has been publicized. We have not been in
contact with Itkin for several years.

Angleton advised that he expects that Itkin will
contact him some time after completion of his interview
and if Angleton learns any information of interest to
the Bureau he will advise us.

Angleton also commented that he is being inter-
viewed himself today by Senate Select Committee representa-
tives regarding his knowledge of the "Huston Report."

Memorandum

TO : Mr. W. R. Wannall

DATE: 6/25/75

FROM : W. Cregar

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

PURPOSE:

To advise that representatives of Intelligence Division this date reviewed 693-page CIA document containing information relating to joint ventures involving CIA and other members of intelligence community in sensitive matters, and a specific request has been made for CIA to furnish this Bureau with copies of all material contained therein believed to have a bearing on FBI activities.

DETAILS:

By memorandum 6/24/75 you were advised that arrangements had been effected whereby a CIA representative would on 6/25/75 bring to FBIHQ a copy of the 693-page document containing a series of memoranda and reports prepared by CIA citing instances wherein CIA may have engaged in activities outside the perimeter of its charter. As you have been advised, members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) have had prior access to this document and it contains numerous references to FBI-CIA joint ventures, some of which are of an extremely sensitive nature. CIA Director William Colby authorized a review of this document and agreed to this Bureau obtaining a copy of material contained therein believed pertinent to this Bureau's operations.

62-116395-321

On 6/25/75, Mrs. Harriet Mowitt, Executive Secretary of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group, appeared at Bureau Headquarters with the 693-page document divided into three packages. These

Re: Senstudy 75

packages were reviewed by Section Chief William O. Cregar
and Special Agents Leon F. Schwartz and Thomas J. McNiff
in Room 4123 ЈЕН.

Material contained therein runs the entire gambit
from CIA cooperation, and in some instances financing of
Bureau sensitive operations in foreign intelligence field,
to CIA involvement in domestic affairs including cooperation
with police departments and other Federal agencies. In all,
it was determined that approximately 174 pages of the document
contain information which in some respect has a bearing on
this Bureau's operations.

Pertinent page numbers were identified to
Mrs. Mowitt and she is taking this Bureau's request for these
pages back to CIA Headquarters for the purpose of obtaining
authorization to furnish this Bureau with copies of the
pages in which this Bureau is interested. Mrs. Mowitt
advised that she would insure our request in this respect
received expeditious attention and she will furnish us with
the results at the earliest time.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. Above submitted for information. You will
be kept advised of developments.

Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM: Legal Counsel

DATE: June 20, 1975

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75 (62-116395)

Attached is a FD 302 reporting a conversation SA Paul V. Daly had with Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. The gist of the conversation is that Mr. Wallach informed SA Daly that he had a list of national security mail covers which cover the last five years and that he would use this list for committee business including for interview purposes if the Bureau did not promptly comply with the Committee's request for a list of mail covers.

The contents of the attached FD 302, were orally furnished on 6-18-75 to Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Michael Shaheen of the Department. Mr. Shaheen and Mr. O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, contacted F. A. O. Schwartz, Chief Counsel to the Senate Select Committee, to protest Mr. Wallach's actions. Mr. Wallach denied, in a conversation with Mr. O'Connor, that he had stated he had such a list to SA Daly. Subsequent to this conversation with Mr. O'Connor, and on the same day according to Mr. Shaheen, Wallach called Shaheen and told Shaheen that he wanted to talk to him off the record, at which point Mr. Wallach stated that he had access to a list of mail covers through a source of his, but did not have possession of same. He also stated that he may have suggested to SA Daly that he had such a list.

Mr. Shaheen stated that it was obvious that Wallach could not be trusted and remarked that the Department had been keeping book on him. Shaheen informed SA Daly that Wallach

had contacted Mr. Cox, Chief Counsel for the United States Postal
Service, at which time he informed Mr. Cox that the White House
had authorized the release of all national security mail covers,
and requested Cox furnish same to him. According to Shaheen,
Cox then contacted the White House to determine if Wallach's
story was in fact true, at which time James Wilderotter, Assistant
Counsel to the President, advised that Wallach's name was unfamiliar
to him, and that he had not been given authority to obtain
national security mail covers. Mr. Shaheen stated he, at the
direction of Mr. O'Connor, was furnishing the Bureau in writing, a
report of his conversations with Wallach and also stated that
O'Connor stated he would no longer have any dealings with Wallach
because of the obvious unethical conduct and lack of honesty on
Wallach's part.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date of transcription 6-18-75

Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, telephonically contacted me on 6-18-75 between 2:30 and 3 o'clock P. M., and inquired as to the status of a request by the Committee concerning mail cover information. He asked if I could furnish him a time when he might expect our response to be delivered to him. He pointed out that he had had previous discussions with me and Mr. Shaheen of the Department concerning this matter, and Mr. Shaheen had indicated to him that he could expect the response to have been given to him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a time certain for delivery of a response concerning this request could not be given, and it was explained to him that a vast amount of material was being reviewed pursuant to request of the Senate Select Committee and other committees of Congress and that because of the amount of work involved in all these requests it was not possible to make a judgment as to the date of the response.

Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been misled by Mr. Shaheen into believing that he would have a response to his request and that he was going to recontact Mr. Shaheen. He made a general inquiry as to whether one Agent might be gathering all the information and as to whether he might be allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review what has been gathered to this point. He was informed that all disclosures have to receive proper Bureau approval and that it would not be possible for him to review such information in the absence of such approval. He asked if the Bureau could separate the response by making available immediately portions of the mail cover lists such as the identities of people who were the targets of mail covers in the domestic field. He again was informed that this was not possible in the absence of proper approval. Mr. Wallach stated that he wanted me to know that he was in possession of a list of Bureau mail covers for the past five years which he had been furnished by a source whom he did not identify. He was asked (1) if this list concerned the mail covers in the national security areas and, (2) was it a national list. Mr. Wallach stated it was a national list in the national security areas. He stated he was not sure of its accuracy. He indicated that he would have no reservations about using the list to conduct the Senate Select Committee business and stated that interviews may be conducted based on the list.

He was advised that the list would contain sensitive information which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau investigations. He replied that the names were not classified, and since they were not classified he would have no problem in using the list. It was explained to Mr. Wallach that despite the fact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in possession of sensitive information concerning that individual. Mr. Wallach pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been informed previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureau should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names are sensitive and which are not. Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memorandum 6/6/75 related contact with Legal Counsel Division by former SA Richard H. Davis who had been contacted by Michael Epstein, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee (SSC), who desired to interview Davis in Atlanta, Georgia, concerning the former FBI investigations of Martin Luther King, Jr., Stanley David Levison and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Davis requested a Bureau representative be made available for consultation purposes during the interview and that Davis would contact FBIHQ as soon as a date and place of interview had been determined. Approval has already been granted by the Bureau for the release of Davis from his employment agreement for purpose of the interview and you (Mr. Wannall) designated S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project to be the Bureau representative at the interview.

Phillips took a telephone call this morning from former SA Alan G. Sentinella (has already been interviewed and testified before the SSC) who advised that he had been contacted earlier this morning by Richard Davis. Davis told Sentinella that Epstein had called him 6/25/75 and made an appointment to interview Davis in Atlanta (exact site unknown) 2:00 p.m., Tuesday, 7/8/75. Davis had first tried to reach Charles Haynes, a supervisor in the Atlanta Office, on 6/25/75 and, being unable to do so, decided to pass the information to Sentinella as he knew that Sentinella had had several contacts with FBIHQ in relation to Sentinella's own testimony and Davis requested Sentinella to pass the information to FBIHQ. Davis gave his

THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, BY SSC
STAFF MEMBERS

2-Mr. Mintz
(1-Mr. Hotis)

1-Mr. Daly

The following information concerning the interview
of Miss Helen W. Gandy by members of the Staff of the SSC in
Washington, D. C., on May 15, 1975, was voluntarily furnished to
the FBI by Miss Gandy and by Mr. John P. Mohr, former Assistant
to the Director of the FBI, who was present during the interview at
the request of Miss Gandy.

Miss Gandy was interviewed by Staff Members Mark
Gitenstein and Michael Epstein from approximately 10:30 a. m. to
1:00 p. m., and from 2:00 p. m. to 3:00 p.m. Staff Member Martha
Talley was also present during the morning session of the interview.
Miss Gandy was not placed under oath, and she was not advised of
her rights or that she could be represented by personal counsel.

The questioning of Miss Gandy was directed primarily
toward obtaining information on procedures and personnel in the office
of former Director Hoover, on the floor plan of Mr. Hoover's office
suite, on the "Official and Confidential" (OC) files maintained in
Mr. Hoover's office, and on the destruction of Mr. Hoover's personal
correspondence by Miss Gandy after Mr. Hoover's death.

Miss Gandy said she was asked about the setup of
Mr. Hoover's office suite and that the questions showed a special
interest in the rear exit of the suite. She explained that this exit was

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

used by Mr. Hoover since it was most convenient to his private
office. Mr. Mohr stated that Mr. Gitenstein had attempted to draw
a chart of Mr. Hoover's office. Since that chart was a poor one,
Mr. Gitenstein asked Mr. Mohr to draw a rough chart of the office,
which Mr. Mohr did. Mr. Mohr recalls that he inadvertently omitted
the supply room from the chart; which room, he said, would have been
of little or no significance to the questioners since it contained only
supplies and no files. Mr. Mohr said concerning the back door to
Mr. Hoover's office, that interviewers were informed that persons
visiting Mr. Hoover were not brought through this back door, which
was for Mr. Hoover's use.

Miss Gandy was asked by Staff Members about the use
of the conference room, who attended the conferences, and the purpose
of the conferences. She said that Mr. Mohr explained that the Director
at these conferences discussed with FBI officials matters regarding
FBI administration and policy. She was also asked about the contents
of bookcases in the conference room which contained criminal code
volumes, ring binders of interesting cases, and miscellaneous books.

Miss Gandy was asked how many file cabinets were in
her office. She answered that she could not be positive but she believed
there were approximately ten or twelve cabinets of five drawers each.
These cabinets were secured with special locks and the key was kept
in a special locked key cabinet.

Miss Gandy was asked for the names of other employees
in Mr. Hoover's office and she provided the names of Miss Edna Holmes,
Mrs. Erma Metcalf, Miss Ruth McCord, Miss Nancy Ana Mooney and
Mr. Ronald E. Thompson.

Miss Gandy was asked if the Office Manager, Miss Holmes,
had files in her office and she answered, "no." She was asked if the Office
Manager's secretary, Miss McCord, had files in her office and she
answered that Miss McCord did have those files necessary to her super-
vision of office personnel and maintenance. She also explained the
function of the office receptionist.

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

Miss Gandy was asked whether files were kept in the Telephone Room and answered that the only files kept there were background material necessary to the functioning of that office. She was asked if a record was kept of telephone calls and visitors to the Director. She replied that a daily log was maintained, and that these logs were permanently filed in the main Bureau files.

Miss Gandy was asked if files were kept in the office of the mail clerk, Miss Mooney. She answered "yes," and described these files as mainly photograph files and scrapbooks.

Concerning the mail in Mr. Hoover's office, Mr. Mohr said Mr. Gitenstein raised a question about "Expedite Processing" of mail, to which Miss Gandy replied that the personal and confidential mail for Mr. Hoover was handled by Miss Mooney and that she, Miss Gandy, was not aware of just how this mail was handled. Mr. Mohr said he explained to the questioners that this mail was received in the Routing Unit of the Records and Communications Division and was taken unopened to Miss Mooney, who opened it. The clerical employee who brought the mail then logged it and stamped "Expedite Processing" on the left-hand edge. Then, the clerical employee would take the log back to the Routing Unit and when the mail was subsequently returned to the Routing Unit for regular filing purposes, the item would be crossed off the log. Mr. Mohr said Mr. Gitenstein wanted to know if the "Expedite Processing" logs were maintained permanently and Mr. Mohr answered that to his knowledge the logs were not kept after the items on a particular log had been accounted for.

Mr. Mohr said that Miss Gandy was asked about procedures regarding Mr. Hoover's commitments and she explained that each morning the employees in the Telephone Room prepared a "commitment card" of Mr. Hoover's commitments for the day and this card was placed on Mr. Hoover's desk the first thing in the morning

- 3


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

for his information. Miss Gandy told the questioners that she received a copy of the commitment card and that these cards were not retained permanently. Mr. Mohr said that it was explained to the interviewers that the Bureau had an instruction that items of a temporary nature were to be destroyed after they were 90 days old and Miss Gandy indicated to the interviewers that commitment cards were in this category. Mr. Mohr said Miss Gandy was queried at length as to just how Telephone Room employees got their information to make up the commitment card and she explained that all employees in Mr. Hoover's office made certain the Telephone Room employees were promptly advised of all Mr. Hoover's commitments as they were made.

Further, concerning the Telephone Room, Mr. Mohr said the interviewers were informed that calls for Mr. Hoover were received in the Burean switchboard and were then referred to the Telephone Room in Mr. Hoover's office. The employees in the Telephone Room connected Mr. Hoover with the calls. Mr. Mohr said the interviewers asked whether the Telephone Room "screened" Mr. Hoover's calls and that they were informed that the Telephone Room did not "screen" them except for "nut" calls.

Miss Gandy said she informed interviewers, in response to questions, that she did receive calls from persons wishing to speak with Mr. Hoover and if he was in his office, the calls would be transferred to his Telephone Room. She said Mr. Gitenstein made a remark about a special telephone connection between Mr. Hoover and former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and also remarked that Mr. Hoover and former Attorney General John Mitchell also had a special telephone connection. Miss Gandy said she corrected Mr. Gitenstein immediately by informing him that no special telephone connection existed with any Attorney General except Attorney General Kennedy.

Concerning the OC files maintained in Mr. Hoover's office suite, Miss Gandy said she informed the interviewers that these files were kept in a locked file cabinet and occupied about one and

- 4 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

one half or two file drawers. In answer to questions from the interviewers, Miss Gandy said she informed them that on the day of Mr. Hoover's death she spoke with Mr. Clyde Tolson, who was then Acting Director of the FBI, and with Mr. Mohr and asked to whom she should deliver the OC files and other Burean material contained in Mr. Hoover's office.

Mr. Tolson instructed that the OC files and all other Bureau material such as interesting cases, monographs and manuals be delivered to Mr. Mark Felt who then was Assistant Director-Deputy Associate Director of the FBL Miss Gandy said she was exhaustively questioned by Mr. Epstein as to whether she called Mr. Tolson or he called her and concerning Mr. Tolson's location at the time.

Miss Gandy said she told Mr. Epstein that at this late date she had no idea who called whom but Mr. Epstein was assured that she and Mr. Tolson communicated. She was also asked when Mr. Tolson arrived at Mr. Hoover's house on the morning of Mr. Hoover's death. She answered that Mr. Tolson arrived there soon after Mr. Hoover's body was discovered. Miss Gandy said she asked the interviewers if they desired more details of that morning and was told that they did not.

Miss Gandy said she told the interviewers that Mr. Tolson's instructions were carried out. The OC files and the index cards pertaining to them and the other Bureau material mentioned above were placed in cartons and delivered to Mr. Felt. She was asked who delivered the cartons to Mr. Felt's office and answered that she believed that the delivery was handled by messengers or maintenance personnel, but indicated she was not certain about this.

Miss Gandy said she told the interviewers that as soon as Mr. L. Patrick Gray III was named to head the FBI, Mr. Felt brought him to the Director's office to afford him an idea of the office setup. After Mr. Gray indicated a very special interest in the files in her office, the contents of these files were explained to him and he

- 5 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

was invited to view the contents. Mr. Gray did glance through a drawer and obviously was satisfied that they contained personal correspondence only and was also satisfied that the Bureau material had been delivered to Mr. Felt.

Miss Gandy said one of the interviewers remarked that there appeared to be more OC files than had been indicated and that a larger number had been given to Attorney General Levi. She responded that she would not know whether other files had been added to the group after they had been delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr. Gitenstein, she said, attempted to show her a pamphlet apparently containing testimony of the Attorney General which described certain of the files in question. Mr. Gitenstein asked her about specific cases in the OC files and she told him that after three years she would not presume to try to remember specifics. Mr. Gitenstein asked if there was a file containing reports from the Washington Field Office. She told him that she certainly would not remember such a file, if one existed.

Miss Gandy said there was much questioning about the index cards which pertained to the OC files. She told the interviewers that they were filed in one index file, that cards of a different color were used and that this index file was locked.

Miss Gandy said she told the interviewers that strictly personal correspondence of Mr. Hoover had been contained in the file cabinets in her office and that from time to time during the past fifty years, files which were no longer current were eliminated. Concerning the destruction of Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence, she told interviewers that on the day of Mr. Hoover's death, she advised Mr. Tolson of Mr. Hoover's expressed instruction that his personal correspondence be destroyed, that Mr. Hoover had begun a review of these personal files sometime prior to his death and that some of them had been already destroyed.

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTER ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

Miss Gandy said she told the interviewers that up until the time she left the Bureau, she continued to tear up the contents of Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files and deposited the contents of the files in the "confidential trash" waste baskets. Mr. Mohr said Mr. Epstein wanted to know if a log was maintained of items placed in the confidential trash baskets for destruction. Mr. Mohr informed Mr. Epstein that it would be ridiculous to think that such a log could be maintained and Mr. Mohr advised him exactly how confidential trash is destroyed in the Bureau. Mr. Mohr said he informed Mr. Epstein of the Bureau files that were scattered over the streets of Southwest Washington as a result of the Department of Justice engaging in destruction of some of its files. Mr. Mohr said this reference permitted an immediate termination of any questions regarding the destruction of confidential trash.

Miss Gandy said she told interviewers she asked Mr. Gray if, in order to vacate the office as soon as possible for his convenience, she could have his approval to send to Mr. Hoover's house the personal correspondence files which could not be disposed of before the date of her retirement, so that she could finish the task there. Mr. Gray did not hesitate to give her this permission. Mr. Felt, who was present when she spoke with Mr. Gray in her office, suggested that a locked room, on the fifth floor, with a key only she would have, could be made available so the files could be disposed of without moving. Miss Gandy said that would not be necessary and Mr. Gray agreed. At this point Mr. Gitenstein asked Miss Gandy if she thought she might not be the only one with a key. Miss Gandy asked Mr. Gitenstein what he would have thought and she said Mr. Gitenstein smiled and said he would have thought that.

Miss Gandy said that at a point in the interview when the questioning appeared to be getting pretty far afield, she said to the interviewers that if they were trying to learn whether the OC files contained anything that would be used for political purposes, the answer was no and that she had never found the need to lie about anything.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

Mr. Mohr said that Miss Gandy, when she was describing to the interviewers exactly how Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files were destroyed, said she reviewed each item that she handled to make sure that it was not related to Bureau official business. Mr. Mohr said Miss Gandy had previously indicated that Mrs. Erma Metcalf had assisted her in destroying these files, but Miss Gandy did not mention that Mrs. Metcalf made the same type of review and Miss Gandy was not questioned regarding whether Mrs. Metcalf made such a review as she went through the files and helped destroy them.

Mr. Mohr said that during the interview a rather heated conversation occurred over some of the questions which seemed to be repetitious and irrelevant. Mr. Mohr said he told Mr. Gitenstein he felt it was high time the questioners quit "beating around the bush" and come to the point by asking Miss Gandy if she ever destroyed any official and confidential files. Mr. Gitenstein replied that they had a discrepancy concerning the OC files in that a reliable source had reported that Mr. Mark Felt had five two-drawer cabinets marked "O and C Files" in his office. Miss Gandy on the other hand told Mr. Gitenstein in response to a question that she had turned over to Mr. Felt after Mr. Hoover's death, as she recollected, one and one half drawers and possibly two drawers of OC files. Mr. Mohr said he explained to Mr. Gitenstein that Miss Gandy would have no way of knowing what files Mr. Felt had in his office and if there was a discrepancy, the person to resolve it was Mr. Felt, who Mr. Gitenstein had said had been interviewed by him and had been cooperative.

Mr. Mohr said he had previously explained to Mr. Gitenstein, in response to questions at the time Mr. Mohr was interviewed by Staff Members, that at the time Mr. William C. Sullivan had furnished the data of 17 White House telephone tapes to Mr. Mardian in the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice, Mr. Hoover had instructed that any Assistant Director or Bureau


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: INTERVIEW OF HELEN W. GANDY

official who had files in his office that he considered confidential
and relating to the Bureau's work would immediately transfer such
files to Mr. Felt and prepare a memorandum stating exactly what
was transferred to Mr. Felt. Mr. Mohr said he told Mr. Gitenstein
he, Mr. Mohr, had no idea how many files Mr. Felt collected as a
result of Mr. Hoover's instruction. Mr. Mohr said it was interesting
to note that he was not asked at any time whether he had turned over
any files to Mr. Felt in connection with Mr. Hoover's instructions.

Mr. Mohr stated that Miss Gandy was asked during
her interview whether there were any files of Mr. Hoover's personal
correspondence in Mr. Hoover's former home at the present time and
Miss Gandy replied, "no."

Mr. Mohr said Mr. Epstein questioned Miss Gandy at
length concerning her title as "Executive Assistant." Mr. Epstein
wanted to know when she acquired this title and she said she could not
recall. Mr. Epstein asked whether anyone else at the FBI had occupied
this position and Miss Gandy explained that she was the only employee
with the title of Executive Assistant who had served under Mr. Hoover
during his tenure in office. Mr. Epstein seemed to pay a great deal
of attention to the title Executive Assistant and Mr. Mohr attempted to
explain to him that the title was a Civil Service Commission (CSC) title
and that Miss Gandy's position was set up under the Classification Act
administered by the CSC. Mr. Mohr said he was not sure what was
behind Mr. Epstein's lengthy questioning about this title, but Mr. Mohr
got the impression that Mr. Epstein may have been trying to find out
if Miss Gandy acted for Mr. Hoover on her own initiative. Mr. Mohr
said this was just a guess on his part.

Miss Gandy said that at one point during the interview,
the questions concerned Mr. Hoover's being advised of Bureau matters.
She said the interviewers were told by her and by Mr. Mohr that
Mr. Hoover was never out of touch with the Burean, day or night,
whether he was in town or out of town.

Present at questioning -

Mark Gitenstein
Mike Epstein
Martha Talley (morning session only)
John P. Mohr
Helen W. Gandy

The first questions concerned the set-up of the Director's office suite. Special interest was indicated in the rear exit of the suite and it was explained that this exit was used by the Director as it was most convenient to his private office. Mr. Mohr also mentioned the kitchen and lavatory, as the questioners appeared to be completely unfamiliar with the arrangement of the suite.

Next, the conference room was described and in answer to questions the use of the conference room was explained - also, information was given re the contents of the bookcases in this room, ie, miscellaneous books; the Criminal Code volumns; the ring binders of Interesting Cases.

Numerous questions were asked:
How often did the Director call conferences of the officials of the Bureau -
what were the purposes of these conferences -
just who attended them -
were they called by the Director - and was this at set and regular intervals.

Mr. Mohr explained that the Director from time to time, as he reviewed matters of policy and like matters that came to his attention, made notes which he discussed with the officials, giving them his ideas on these matters and in turn listening to their views. These sessions considered over all matters re Bureau administration and policy.

Three; The physical set-up of the office of the Executive Assistant:

I was asked re the number of file cases in my office - I answered that I could not, at this date, be positive, but I believe there were approximately ten or twelve five-drawer cabinets -

What were the contents of these cabinets and where were the so-called o.c. files - were the o.c. files contained in combination locked cabinets

I answered that all of the cabinets in my office were secured with special locks and key, and that the key was kept in a special locked key-cabinet in this office.

Questions-did I receive calls for the Director from his friends and others, and did I transfer them to his desk; did I make memoranda of such calls; did I keep a diary; (Mr. Gitenstein made a remark re a special telephone connection between the Director and "Bobby", apparently thought better of it, and remarked that Mr. Mitchell had such a connection)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

2. 
He was immediately corrected by me to the effect that no such connection existed with Attorneys General other than Attorney General Kennedy. I answered that I did receive calls from persons wishing to speak with the Director; that, if he were in his office, such calls would be transferred to the Director's Office telephone room to be connected with the Director if he should be in his office and could take the call. (Here Mr. Mohr explained in detail the system of handling telephone calls in the Director's office and the functions of the FBI telephone switchboard.)

It was explained that the file cabinets in my office contained strictly personal correspondence of the Director; that from time to time during the past fifty years files which were no longer current were eliminated.

Re the so-called o.c. files- it was explained that these files were located in one of the locked cabinets; that there were, possibly one and a half or two file drawers of these. In answer to questioning it was explained that on the day of Mr. Hoover's death I spoke with both Mr. Tolson, who at that time was Acting Director, and Mr. Mohr, and asked for instructions as to whom I should deliver the official-confidential files and other Bureau material contained in the Director's offices. I also advised Mr. Tolson of Mr. Hoover's expressed instructions that his personal correspondence be destroyed, and that he, Mr. Hoover, had begun a review of these personal files sometime previous to his death, and some already had been destroyed. Mr. Tolson instructed that the official-confidential files and all other Bureau material, ie, Interesting Cases; monographs, Manuels, be delivered to Mr. Mark Felt. (Here, I was asked where the Bureau material was kept and answered that bookcases in my office were used for this purpose.

I was exhaustively questioned by Mr. Epstein as to whether I called Mr. Tolson (and where he was located at the time) or whether Mr. Tolson called me. I told him that at this late date I had no idea as to who called whom, but that he was assured that Mr. Tolson and I communicated. I also was asked when Mr. Tolson arrived at Mr. Hoover's house on the morning in question and/was told Mr. Tolson arrived after Mr. Hoover's body was discovered. (I asked if more details of that morning were desired and was told no.) I explained that instructions were immediately carried out; the o.c. files, with the index cards pertaining to them, together with the above mentioned Bureau material, was placed in cartons and delivered to Mr. Felt. I was asked who carried these cartons to Mr. Felt's office and said I could not at this date answer this but I believe they would have been carried by either messengers or maintenance personnel.

*There was quite much questioning here as to how and where the index cards were filed. It was explained that they were filed in the one index file, cards of a different color being used, and that this file also was locked.

NW 88326 Docld:32989611 Page 117


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

3. In connection with the above authorizations it was explained that as soon as Mr. Gray was named as the new Director Mr. Felt brought him to the Director's office to afford him an idea of the office set-up; that Mr. Gray indicated a very special interest in the files in my office; that their contents were explained to him and that he was invited to view the contents. He did glance thru a drawer and obviously was satisfied that they contained personal correspondence anly, and was also satisfied that the Bureau material had been delivered to Mr. Felt. One of the questioners remarked that there appeared to be more o.c. files than had been indicated; that a larger number had been given to Attorney General Levi...I remarked that I would not know whether other files had been added to the group after they had been delivered to Mr. Felt. Mr. Gitenstein then attempted to show me a pamphlet indicating what appeared to be testimony of the Attorney General describing certain of the files in question and asked questions re specific cases which were contained in the o.c. files. I told him I would not presume, after three years, to try to remember specifics. He asked if there were a file containing reports from the Washington Field Office. I told him certainly I would not remember such a file, if one existed.

To questions regarding the destruction of personal correspondence files I explained that up until the time I left the Bureau I continued to tear up and deposit the contents of these files in the "confidential trash" waste baskets; (Mr. Mohr here explained this method of disposal.) that I had asked Mr. Gray if, in order to vacate the office as soon as possible for his convenience, I could have his approval to send to Mr. Hoover's house files which could not be disposed of before my date of retirement and finish the taskthere. He did not hesitate to give me this permission. (Mr. Felt, who was present when I spoke with Mr. Gray (in my office) suggested that a locked room on the fifth floor, with a key only I would have, could be made available so the files would be disposed of without moving. I said that would not be necessary and Mr. Gray agreed. At this point Mr. Gitenstein asked me if I thought I might not be the only one with a key. I asked him what he would have thought and he smiled and said he would have thought that.

Four: Questions were asked, in further connection with the set-up of the office and personnel.

The office of the Office Manager (Miss Holmes). Did she have file cases in her office. The answer was "no".

The office of the secretary to the Office Manager (Miss McCord) Were there files in her office and if so what did they contain. The answer was "yes" and the contents were material necessary for use by the Office Manager in connection with her supervision of the office personnel, and maintainance.

The reception room. The function of the receptionist was explained.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 119

4. 
The telephone room. Here, again, close questioning re files kept in this office. Assurance was given that the only files kept here were background material necessary to the functioning of the office. Questions were asked if records were made of telephone calls and visitors to the Director. Information was given that a daily log was maintained, and it was described. Question was asked re where and how long the logs were maintained. Answer was that they were permanently filed in the main Bureau files. Mail clerk's (Miss Mooney) office. Were there files here? Answer was yes, mainly photograph files and also the scrap books.

The names of Miss Holmes - Mrs. Metcalf - Miss McCord - Ron Thompson and Miss Mooney were requested and given.

At one point during the sessions in being questioned re the Director's being advised of Bureau matters the questioners were told by both Mr. Mohr and me that Mr. Hoover never was out of touch with the Bureau, day or night, whether in town or out of town.

Also, I said at a point when the questioning appeared to be getting pretty far afield, if what they were trying to learn was whether there was contained in the o.c. files anything that would be used for political purpose, the answer was NO - that I had never found the need to lie about anything.

RE: MISS GANDY'S QUESTIONING BY SENATE
SELECT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING
FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH INTELLIGENCE-
GATHERING FUNCTIONS

Miss Gandy and I appeared before the staff of the subcommittee for questioning on May 15, 1975, our appointment being set for 10:30 a. m. The group consisting of Messrs. Gitenstein, Epstein and M. S. Talley immediately proceeded to the former Carroll Arms Apartment building which is now used as an office building by the U.S. Senate. We were taken to the sixth floor where we entered an empty office which contained telephone equipment, some chairs, and a desk.

Mr. Gitenstein had apparently drawn up a list of questions he wished to discuss with Miss Gandy and he referred to this list throughout the questioning period.

There is attached a rough draft memorandum consisting of four pages and dated May 15, 1975, which was prepared by Miss Gandy concerning her recollection of what transpired during the interview. The interview, incidentally, lasted until 1 p.m. when a one-hour break was taken for lunch. The session reconvened at 2 p. m. and was terminated at 3 p.m.

I am setting forth hereafter in numbered paragraphs items which I recollect transpired during the interview which should be helpful in embellishing Miss Gandy's memorandum.

(1) During the early part of the questioning, Mr. Gitenstein attempted to draw a chart of Mr. Hoover's office in the Department of Justice building. He said he had previously visited Mr. Kelley's suite in the Justice Building. His effort at charting the office was poor at best and he requested my assistance. A rough chart was drawn showing Mr. Hoover's personal office on one end and Miss Mooney's office on the other end. In making up the chart I inadvertently left out the supply room which, of course, would have been of little or no significance to the questioners since this room contained supplies only and no files.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

(2) Sometime during the interview, Mr. Gitenstein raised a question about "Expedite Processing" of mail and how it was handled in Mr. Hoover's office. Miss Gandy pointed out that the handling of personal and confidential mail for Mr. Hoover was handled by Miss Mooney and she, Miss Gandy, was not aware of just how this mail was handled. I explained that all mail received in the Routing Unit of the Records and Communications Division was taken unopened to Miss Mooney in Mr. Hoover's office where she opened this mail and the clerical employee who brought the mail down then logged it in and stamped the mail "Expedite Processing" on the left-hand edge. Thereafter the clerica employee would take the log back to the Routing Unit and when the mail was subsequently returned to the Routing Unit for regular filing purposes the item would be crossed off the log. Mr. Gitenstein wanted to know if the "Expedite Processing" logs were maintained permanently and he was informed that to my knowledge they were not kept after accounting for the particular items of mail contained on the particular log.

(3) Mr. Epstein questioned Miss Gandy at length concerning her title as "Executive Assistant." He wanted to know when she acquired this title and she said she could not recall. He wanted to know whether anyone else at the FBI had occupied this position and Miss Gandy explained that she was the only employee with the title of Executive Assistant who had served under Mr. Hoover during his tenure in office. Mr. Epstein seemed to pay a great deal of attention to the title Executive Assistant and I endeavored to explain to him that the title was a Civil Service Commission title and that Miss Gandy's position was set up under the Classification Act administered by the Civil Service Commission. Although I am not sure what was behind Mr. Epstein's lengthy questioning about this matter, I got the impression he might be trying to find out if Miss Gandy acted for Mr. Hoover on her own initiative. This is just a guess on my part and I am not sure what was behind his questioning.

(4) During Miss Gandy's description of the various offices, she did mention specifically the fact that the interesting case files were maintained on the shelves in the big conference room in black folders. They asked what the interesting case files consisted of and I explained this to their satisfaction; namely, that they were writeups of closed cases which might be of interest for various purposes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 122

(5) I should mention that Miss Gandy in describing exactly how Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files were destroyed said she reviewed each item that she handled to make sure that it was not related to Bureau official business. She had previously indicated that Mrs. Erma Metcalf had assisted her in destroying these files but she did not mention that Mrs. Metcalf endulged in the same type of review and Miss Gandy was not questioned whether Mrs. Metcalf had made such a review as she went through the files and helped destroy them.

(6) Both Mr. Gitenstein and Mr. Epstein queried Miss Gandy at length about the log kept in the Telephone Room of all calls taken by Mr. Hoover. They also queried her at length concerning a log that was kept in the Telephone Room of all visitors to FBI Headquarters who were seen by Mr. Hoover. Miss Gandy explained that these logs, to her knowledge, were currently retained in the regular Bureau file room.

(7) Miss Gandy was asked regarding Mr. Hoover's commitments and she explained that each morning the employees in the Telephone Room prepared a commitment card of Mr. Hoover's commitments for the day and this card was placed on Mr. Hoover's desk the first thing in the morning for his information. Miss Gandy reported that she received a copy of this commitment card. She was asked whether these commitment cards were retained permanently and she replied in the negative. Somewhere along the line it was explained to the interviewers that the Bureau had an instruction that all items of a temporary nature, such as ticklers and the like were to be destroyed after they were 90 days old. Miss Gandy indicated these commitment cards would have come under this category for destruction. Miss Gandy was queried at length as to just how the Telephone Room employees got their information to make up the commitment card and she explained that all employees in Mr. Hoover's office made certain the Telephone Room employees were promptly advised of all of Mr. Hoover's commitments as they were made.

(8) In explaining the telephone set-up in the Department of Justice building as far as it related to the FBI, the Staff members were informed that calls for Mr. Hoover were received in the Bur eau's switchboard and were then referred to the Telephone Room in Mr. Hoover's office and the employees in the Telephone Room handled the problem of connecting Mr. Hoover with the caller. They wanted to know whether employees in the Telephone Room screened Mr. Hoover's telephone calls and they were informed Telephone Room employees did not screen them except for "nut" calls.

(9) During a rather heated conversation in the afternoon about some of the questioning being done which seemed to be repetitious and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 123

irrelevant, Mr. Gitenstein was told by me that I felt it was high time the questioners quit "beating around the bush" and came to the point by asking Miss Gandy if she had ever destroyed any official and confidential files. Mr. Gitenstein replied they had a discrepancy concerning the O and C files in that a reliable source had reported that Mr. Mark Felt had five two-drawer cabinets marked "O and C Files" in his office. Miss Gandy on the other hand told Mr. Gitenstein in response to a question that she had turned over to Mr. Felt after Mr. Hoover's death, as she recollected, one and one-half drawersand possibly two drawers of O and C files. I explained to Mr. Gitenstein that Miss Gandy would have no way of knowing what files Mr. Felt had in his office and if there was a discrepancy the person to resolve the discrepancy was Mr. Felt who Mr. Gitenstein had told me previously had been interviewed by him and had been cooperative. I had previously explained to Mr. Gitenstein in response to que stions he asked me when I appeared before the Staff that at the time Mr. William C. Sullivan had furnished the data of the 17 White House telephone taps to Mr. Mardian in the Internal Security Division of the Department that Mr. Hoover had instructed that any Assistant Director or Bureau official who had any files in his office he considered to be confidential and relating to the Bureau's work were to be immediately transferred to Mr. Felt and a memorandum prepared concerning exactly what was transferred to Mr. Felt. I told Mr. Gitenstein I had no idea how many files Mr. Felt collected as a result of Mr. Hoover's instructions. It is interesting to note that I was not asked at any time whether I had turned over any files to Mr. Felt in connection with Mr. Hoover's instructions.

(10) Miss Gandy was asked whether there were any files of Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence in Mr. Hoover's former home at the present time. Miss Gandy replied no.

(11) At some point during the interview a reference was made to the confidential trash baskets maintained in the Bure au, to wit, the trash baskets with the painted rim on top. Mr. Epstein wanted to know if a log was maintained of items placed in the confidential trash baskets for destruction. I informed him it wuld be ridiculous to think that such a log could be maintained and he was advised exactly how confidential trash is destroyed in the Bureau. He was also informed of the Bureau files that were scattered over the streets of Southwest Washington as a result of the Department of Justice engaging in destruction of some of their files. This reference permitted an immediate termination of any questions along the lines of the destruction of confidential trash.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

(12) Miss Gandy refers to the fact that questions were raised concerning Mr. Hoover's back door entrance. The questions concerning this back door were to determine just who used this back door entrance and its purpose. In addition to explaining it was immediately adjacent to the elevators at 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue which Mr. Hoover used to enter and exit the building, they were also advised that this was Mr. Hoover's private and personal entrance and that persons wishing to see Mr. Hoover were not brought through this back door.

The foregoing is submitted for information purposes and as an auxiliary record of Miss Gandy's appearance before the Staff of the Senate Select Committee on May 15, 1975, accompanied by me, John P. Mohr.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE on Intelligence

Activities

DATE: 6/10/75

On 6/9/75, Mr. K. William O'Connor advised me that the Senate Select Committee would like to obtain access to Appendices A through E of the original Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO. He advised that the Deputy Attorney General had requested him to determine by the morning of 6/10/75 whether the FBI would object to disclosing the Appendices to the Committee. Subsequently, Mr. O'Connor sent me a copy of a notehe addressed to the Deputy Attorney General dated 6/9/75, and its enclosure (a copy of a letter from Senator Church to the Attorney General dated 6/9/75), both of which pertain to the Senate Select Committee request to have access to Appendices A through E of the Petersen report. The letter also requests access to Appendices K and L for inspection by designated Committee staff at the Department of Justice (Copies of these two are attached).

Previously, the Intelligence Division has been requested to review Appendices A through E which are summaries of the several CONINTELPRO programs. This memorandumshould be referred to the Intelligence Division to indicate the need to expedite that review and to furnish appropriate recommendations to the Director concerning any objections the FBI should have to disclosure of the Appendices requested. In view of the urgency of the information furnished by Mr. O'Connor it is suggested that this memorandum serve as the authority for the disclosing of the requested Appendices in the absence of any strong objections by the Intelligence Division.

RECOMMENDATION:

Legal Counsel Division authorize advise Mr. O'Connor on the morning of 6/10/75, that the FBI will defer to the judgment of the Deputy Attorney General in regard to disclosure of Appendices A through E of the Petersen report and of limited access to Appendices K and L by designated staff representatives.

# ADDENDUM: INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 6/10/75 ABF:glw

Intelligence Division strongly feels Exhibits A through E should not be made available. These constitute work papers prepared on an expedite basis by Special Agents operating under the understanding their effort was of a rough draft nature which would be utilized by a committee of the Justice Department and FBI for an in-house investigation. The Agents preparing the documents never conceived that their effort would be subject to review outside of the Department and particularly outside the Executive Branch.

By letter dated 4/21/75 to the Attorney General it was pointed out these exhibits related to the internal deliberations of the Department and FBI representatives, some of the material in these summaries is classified and relates to sensitive operations and they should not be revealed. Also, Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Silberman in testimony before the Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee (Edwards Committee) on 11/20/74 indicated as regards these documents, "If we had thought it was appropriate to release the full discussion we would have done so at the time. There are a lot of internal working documents which go into the making of a final report."

Further, if these documents are released to the SSC, or if the Committee is allowed access to them, we would not then be in a position to deny access to them by the Edwards Committee or the House Select Committee on Intelligence (Nedzi). Should they be released and come within the public domain, we could then be in a position of violating individual rights of privacy and compromising sensitive investigative techniques and Bureau sources. We feel we should first go through these work papers and excise such items to avoid any such complication.

INTD recommends Legal Counsel advise Mr. O'Connor we strongly object to the release of the above Exhibits to the SSC. However, we recognize our objection may be overruled by the Attorney General; and if so, we would request we have an opportunity to make the excisions noted above prior to the Department turning the Exhibits over to the SSC.

The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Attorney General

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Thank you for your letters of May 17 and May 23, 1975, informing the Select Committee of five additional COINTELPRO-type operations disclosed by the continuing FBI review of its counterintelligence files. The Committee appreciates your candor in disclosing the sensitive aspects of these programs. Pursuant to its rules, the Committee will handle this information with the necessary security.

I have been informed that a member of the Committee staff has inspected and taken notes on the 39-page report of the Petersen committee on COINTELPRO. I believe that our security arrangements are more than sufficient to safeguard the confidentiality of its contents. The Committee members themselves as well as the staff would be convenienced by its availability in our secure facilities.

I believe that it is vitally important for the Committee to be provided with Appendices A through E of that report. These documents will also be handled according to our stringent security arrangements. In addition, Appendices K and L should be made available for inspection by designated Committee staff at the Department of Justice. I understand that these appendices are not "raw files" of the FBI.

JUN 5 1975

TO: Harold R. Tyler, Jr.
Deputy Attorney General

FROM: K. William O'Connor'
Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination

SUBJECT: COINTELPRO/Petersen Report

On June 4, 1975, Mr. Elliff of SSC reviewed the 39-page Petersen Report. Afterwards, he had a conference with me from 4:15 to 4:45. The conference resulted in a modification of the previous request. I told him I would be back in touch with him at an appropriate time. He also indicated a probable future course of action by the Committee.

The modification is as follows:

As to Appendices A-E (the summaries prepared by the FBI of certain COINTELPRO operations) Committee staff access is requested. Mr. Elliff advised that he understood that the FBI raw files question was most sensitive, and that he would propose to have staff of the Committee review these Exhibits, and, if the information in these Exhibits was not sufficient for their purposes, to then request an expanded summary of any particular topic summarized, without reaching the issue of access to the Bureau's "raw files".

As to F-J-Staff Assessments - he feels these are not of. pressing present importance.

As to K-L (summary reports on espionage matters), he would like personal access; he does not view this as important as A-E above.

As to M & N (Criminal Division legal memoranda), these are not of immediate interest,

cc: Maroney
✓Daly


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

As to O-FBI public statement - no interest.

As to P (the overall FBI recommendation), he :
would like *personal* access.

I discussed as an alternative, access to the initiating documents in the COINTELPRO matters; and that I would attempt to obtain those as an alternative solution to his inquiry. He said that he might be interested in those documents, but they were far less important to him than access to A-E. He reiterated his sensitivity to the question of raw files, and indicated a strong inclination to avoid the raw files question, proceeding by the proposed expanded summaries route if necessary, with expanded summaries to be prepared only in the event of specific questions being raised after staff access to A-E.

He then went on to state that he perceived a significance in the recommendation and proposals of the Petersen Report; and that he felt FBI and DOJ policies might be perceived as at loggerheads, although this was muted in the prose. He said that he felt sure that, at an appropriate time, the Committee would wish to explore, by AG testimony at SSC, the actions of the DOJ on the recommendation reflected in the report. I said that I understood his interest in that process.

My recommendation is that, in view of the retrenchment regarding "raw files", A-E be made available, under the conditions outlined above; I am furnishing a copy of this memorandum to Mr. Daly for dissemination to appropriate Executives of the Bureau, and to Mr. Maroney of the Criminal Division.

I believe a prompt decision as to A-E would be most helpful.

DATE: 6-10-75

SUBJECT: SENATE AND HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEES ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to the memorandum of Mr. W. O. Cregar to Mr. W. R. Wannall dated 6-3-75, concerning the above committees!
Attached for approval was a revised draft of the Memorandum of Understanding concerning clearance procedures for Staff Members of captioned Committees. It was pointed out that in accordance with opinion expressed by John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy, Intelligence Community Staff, and Donald E. Moore, Chairman, Security Committee, U. S. Intelligence Board, a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding will not be furnished to Senator Church. The revised draft is to be furnished the Attorney General for his approval.

It is felt that we are confronted with a complex legal problem here and it would appear that if the Senate Select Committee is a party to the Memorandum of Understanding, it is entitled to a copy of such communication to prevent any misun- derstanding in the future and to protect the FBI which has drawn up this Memorandum of Understanding.

Inserted in the revised draft are references to Executive Order (EO) 11652 and Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) No. 1/14. Both are limited in their stated application to the Executive Branch and here their application is being extended to the Legislative Branch, which apparently has no established clearance procedure nor suitability for employment program. Of particular interest is that part of the "Personnel Security Approval Criteria" under DCID 1/14 which reads: "The individual shall be stable, of excellent character and discretion and of unquestioned loyalty to the United States."

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland
Re: Senate and House Select Committees
on Intelligence Activities

Referenced memorandum pointed out that Mr. Clarke
and Mr. Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's
Committee was already following the procedures outlined in
the Memorandum of Understanding, and had completed the
Committee Staff, it would be inappropriate to furnish a copy
of the Memorandum of Understanding to Senator Church. How
would the Senate Select Committee know it is following the
procedures outlined intthe Memorandum of Understanding if
it does not have a copy? Does it have a copy of DCID 1/14
which has been, and possibly still is, classified?

The FBI has now received a request for a total
of 122 investigations from the Senate Select Committee.
This is many more than anticipated with all expenses absorbed
by the FBI in connection with a function of the Legislative
Branch. In addition, 16 requests have been received to
date from the House Select Committee, Also the FBI has been
asked by the Senate Select Committee to conduct additional
investigation concerning Patricia Ann Monaco, already employed
by the Committee, who admits living with Neal Stevens up
to 4-75, and frequenting a lounge known as a hangout for
prostitutes. Neal Stevens has said he engaged "in all forms
of sexual activities" with Monaco. There is also the definite
possibility that we will have to process many of these cases
under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974.

To date notification has been received from the
Director of Central Intelligence (CIA) that a total of 49
employees of the Senate Select Committee have been certified
as meeting requirements of EO 10450 (Security Requirements
for Government Employment) for access to classified information
up to and including Top Secret. Of this number, 17 staff
members have been briefèd on compartmented information and an
additional 5 staff members designated to receive compartmented
information. From the above it is not clear that, as stated
by Mr. Clarke and Mr. Moore, that the Senate Select Committee
"had completed the Committee Staff."

It is noted that CIA refers to EO 10450 but the
Memorandum of Understanding, as approved by CIA, does not
refer to EO 10450.

Re: Senate and House Select Committees

RECOMMENDATION: That the recommendation in referenced

copy of the Memorandum of Understanding to Senator Church
be reconsidered.

# The Attorney General

NOTE:

Memoranda 6/17/75 and 6/23/75, W. 0. Cregar to Mr. W. R. Wannall captioned "Senstudy 75" advised that the Senate Select Committee (SSC) has made several requests of the Bureau for information and documents relating to the so-called "Kissinger 17!" This material is being made available to the Department with the caveats that the Government has not publicly admitted to 15 of the coverages involved and that some material contained in the file has been impounded by court order due to the Halperin (one of 17) civil suit. The decision as to whether or not the material prepared in response to the SSC's request is to be turned over to the Committee was left to the Department. As mentioned in above memoranda, Mr. O'Connor advised that he believed it necessary for a representative of his office to personally review the file in question before a knowledgeable determination could be made as to what material should be turned over to the SSC. In anticipation of the Department's request, Legal Counsel Division inquired of the Department's CRIMINAL CIVIL Division as to whether the court order of impoundment would prevent such a review. On 6/20/75, it was ascertained that USDC Judge John Lewis Smith, who issued the impoundment order, gave court clearance to make the "Kissinger 17" file available to the Department for review as indicated above.

The Attorney General

NOTE:

By memorandum from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams dated 6/3/75 captioned "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities," Legal Counsel Division transmitted an "Eyes Only" communication, dated 5/30/75, from the Executive Secretary of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group. In its communication, the USIB Group requested that recipients furnish Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, with suggestions for administrative or legislative action relative to United States intelligence programs.

In response to USIB's request on behalf of Mr. Wilderotter, INTD Supervisors have been canvassed for suggestions and results obtained incorporated in communication being attached for Attorney General's approval. Since USIB's communication was marked "Eyes Only," we have not specifically referenced this document in our response to Mr. Wilderotter. We are, however, providing copies of the USIB letter and our response for the Attorney General's records and for the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. The latter action would appear appropriate, since the Department of Justice was included among the recipients of the USIB letter, although Inspector John B. Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division was erroneously designated as the Departmental addressee by USIB.

June 23, 1975

The Committee has authorized the staff to conduct an investigation of matters pertaining to the above-named informant. Preparations will be made to interview the above-named employees in St. Paul and Des Moines. Liaison officials at the Bureau and the Department of Justice will be contacted shortly by Patrick Shea of the Select Committee staff with regard to the details of these interviews.

This investigation may involve specific allegations of abuse or other controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred. It is not anticipated that these interviews will be monitored by the Bureau or the Department of Justice, as they will relate to alleged abuses falling within the mandate of the Committee pursuant to Senate Resolution 21.

Sincerely,

This is to record assignments of FBI representatives to coordinate with Intelligence Community Staff (ICS) Task Force (TF) leaders on ICS TFS for which FBI does not have primary responsibility.

My memorandum to you 6/17/75 reported upon a 6/13/75 meeting chaired by Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, to discuss the functions of TFS in connection with investigation of the intelligence community by the Senate Select Committee (SSC). An enclosure to that memorandum listed the various TFs and indicated those regarding which the FBI was expected to be involved with. We were asked to designate a specific individual who would coordinate with the TF leader of TFs which were not assigned to FEI representatives. The following designations are proposed:

| Subject                                         | Principal Agency | TF Leader                   | FBI Representatives |

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 9-23-80 BY SZA
MDR16

Reference is made to memorandum from captioned
Committee dated May 14, 1975, and the appendices thereto, which
contained requests for information from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). Item 20, Part II, Appendix C, requested a list
of any Cointelpro-type activities, as defined in the prepared statement
of Attorney General Saxbe before the House Judiciary Committee on
November 20, 1974, which were engaged in by the FBI subsequent to
April 28, 1971, be provided.

In response to this request, it is noted all Counter-
intelligence Programs (Cointelpros) were discontinued by FBI
Headquarters airtel to Albany, with copies to all field offices, dated
April 28, 1971. Specifically, this communication listed seven Cointelpros.
In addition to the seven mentioned in the April 28, 1971, airtel,
subsequent reviews at FBI Headquarters disclosed five additional
Cointelpros. In this context, it should be noted several of the 12
Cointelpro operations related to FBI activities in the foreign counter-
intelligence field.

FBI Headquarters airtel April 28, 1971, discontinuing
the Cointelpros noted as follows, "In exceptional instances where it is
considered counterintelligence action is warranted, recommendations
should be submitted to the Bureau under the individual case caption to
which it pertains. These recommendations will be considered on an
individual basis."

# Documents Pertaining to the "Huston Plan, "
Cointelpro, and Other Practices and Programs

A review of all of our files which have been referred to as Cointelpro files revealed no Cointelpro-type activity since April 28, 1971.

In foreign counterintelligence operations the objectives are detection, penetration and, finally, neutralization of intelligence operations directed against the United States by foreign intelligence services or other hostile elements. Various neutralizing techniques are employed against such services and elements, their officers and their agents in the United States. Among these are double agent operations, disruption, disinformation, penetrations, recruitments, persona non grata action, visa denial and, in rare instances when conditions allow, prosecution. Thus, it can be seen that so-called "Cointelpro-type" techniques are, and always have been, an integral part of our foreign counterintelligence efforts, whether they were practiced in individual cases or under the aegis of a formalized program. This is a critical distinction to be made between our foreign counterintelligence operations and operations conducted in the domestic security field.

In an effort to comply fully with the request to provide a list of any Cointelpro type activities engaged in subsequent to April 28, 1971, in addition to the review of Cointelpro files noted above, personnel of the Intelligence Division were contacted during the week of June 2-6, 1975, to determine if any had knowledge of any such actions. Excepting foreign counterintelligence operations, the results of this inquiry were negative.

NOTE: See letter to the Attorney General, dated 6/23/75, captioned "United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, " prepared by DR:pld.

It is noted in one instance one individual alluded to the TARPRO disinformation-type operation which has been directed against the Soviet intelligence service as being of a Cointelpro character. It is not believed this latter technique constitutes the type of information sought by the Committee.

# Memorandum

TO: Mr. W. C. Sullivan DATE: 4/23/70

FROM: R. D. Cotter

SUBJECT: FBI INTELLIGENCE LETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT

This memorandum recommends that we extend our dissemination of the FBI Intelligence Letter (Inlet) to include Vice President Agnew.

Inlet is outgrowth of Director's personal suggestion for a channel of high-level intelligence directly to the President. It has provided medium for furnishing President sensitive and top-level data in which he would have direct interest and has been disseminated only to President and Attorney General. Since first Inlet issued 11/7/69, we have prepared 36 issues which have summarized 120 individual items of significance on a wide range of topics, including racial violence, New Left intrigue, Soviet and communist bloc espionage, and important foreign intelligence data. Material is presented in a one-page format tailored to the President's convenience.

Vice President Agnew in recent conversations with the Director has indicated a keen interest in the information the Bureau has been furnishing him in recent months regarding domestic and foreign subversion. It is obvious the Vice President is relying on the Bureau as a key source of information. In view of Mr. Agnew's vital interest in these matters and the high position he occupies, it is believed we should at this time include him in dissemination to Inlet.

RESEARCH MATTER

12/26/72

ReBulet 11/26/69.

Referenced letter instructed all field offices to furnish the Bureau high-level intelligence data in the security field which was to be furnished to the President and the Attorney General on a continuing basis. All such communications were to be flagged with the code name "Inlet" in the caption.

Since the inception of this program an evolution in policies and practices has occurred and, currently, the information specified in referenced letter is furnished by each field office in form suitable for teletype dissemination to The White House and the Attorney General as well as other interested agencies of the Government. Accordingly, the "Inlet" program has for all practical purposes, been rendered obsolete and the Bureau is now formally rescinding instructions set forth in referenced letter.

The termination of the "Inlet" program does not relieve the responsibility of all offices to be alert for the intelligence data specified in referenced letter and to submit this information in a timely manner by teletype and in a form suitable for dissemination.

SUBJECT: FBI INTELLIGENCE LETTER FOR
THE PRESIDENT, CODE NAME "INLET"
RESEARCH MATTER

![Signature]

The FBI Intelligence Letter for the President was instituted in November, 1969, pursuant to then FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's instructions to keep the President fully informed of significant intelligence developments within the purview of the Bureau's security responsibilities. Dissemination was restricted to the President, the Attorney General, and later, the Vice President.

By letter dated November 26, 1969, all FBI field offices were advised to flag information obtained in our investigations important enough for the President's interest with the code word "INLET." This was to include:

1) Information of national or international significance which is security related.

2) Important current or pending developments in major security cases.

3) Current information which is representative of or calls attention to a significant developing intelligence trend.

4) Material which has a bearing on national security, particularly that from sensitive and/or penetrative coverage of foreign establishments, which could affect American relations with foreign countries, or assist in formulating United States policy.

5 FEB 16 1973

5) "Inside" information concerning demonstrations, disorders, or other civil disruptions which is of more than local significance.

6) Items with an unusual twist or concerning prominent personalities which may be of special interest to the President or the Attorney General.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: FBI Intelligence Letter for the President Code Name "INLET"


The FBI had, through several Administrations, furnished various Presidents and Attorneys General important intelligence matters on an individual basis. The Intelligence Letter served to consolidate this information into one document. By August, 1970, changes in our communications capability, including the ability to afford immediate teletype dissemination of intelligence data to The White House and the development of other reporting procedures such as the Summary of Extremist Activities, made the Intelligence Letter no longer necessary. Items submitted for this Letter by the field were disseminated in these other ways. In December, 1972, the use of the code word "INLET" was discontinued and field offices so advised. The field was also advised, however, they had the responsibility to be alert for this type intelligence data.

ACTION:

For information.

RE: TESTIMONY OF RETIRED FBI

SPECIAL AGENT (SA) ROBERT R.

NICHOLS BEFORE 38C EXECUTIVE SESSION

Set out below are the facts known to the FBI concerning sworn testimony given to the SSC by Mr. Robert R. Nichols who served as an 84 of the FBI from January 6, 1947, until his retirement May 12, 1972. This information is as voluntarily furnished to the FBI by Nichols.

## CIRCUMSTANCES PRELUDE TO TESTIMONY

On May 28, 1975, Nichols telephonically advised the FBI that SSC Staff Member Lester B. Seidel had requested, and Nichols agreed, to travel to Washington, D. C., from Atlanta, Georgia, to be interviewed in the Committee's offices. Beidel indicated the interview would concern Martin Luther King, Jr., Stanley David Levison, and related matters. Nichols was unable to advise whether it would be a staff interview or an appearance for testimony purposes before an Executive Session of the Committee. Fie was not told by Seidel that his appearance would be pursuant to a subpoena. Nichols requested that the FBI make available a representative so that Nichols might consult with him during the interview, if necessary. Nichols was informed that the presence of a Bureau representative should not be interpreted as the FBI furnishing counsel but that the representative would merely assist Nichols in determining whether a specific question should be answered or whether a response could properly be declined because it falls within one or more privileged areas. He was told these areas covered information

which might compromise a source; information which might
divulge a sensitive investigative technique or method;
information which might divulge what had been furnished the
FBI by other Government agencies and/or foreign intelligence
sources; and information which might adversely affect an
ongoing investigation. It was pointed out to Nichols that
if he so desired, he could obtain private counsel. He was
invited to obtain additional personal briefing on the early
morning of May 30, 1975, before his appearance before the
SSC, from the Legal Counsel Division and the Intelligence
Division of the FBI.

Early on the morning of May 30, 1975, Nichols was
briefed by the FBI, including advice to him that his
employment agreement with the FBI was being waived for the
purposes of the interview by the SSC to the extent that it
pertained to King, Levison and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC), the organization which had been
headed up by King. Nichols was reminded of the areas of
privilege and, at his request, was accompanied to the SSC
offices by SA Seymor F. Phillips of the FBI.

At the SSC offices, Nichols and Phillips met
Mr. John Bayly of the office of the Minority Counsel of the
Committee who indicated that the interview would be under
oath. Staff Member Seidel then appeared and inquiry was
made of him by Phillips as to whether the interview would
be under oath, it being noted that it was only then, after
appearing at the SSC offices, that Nichols and Phillips
became aware of the oath aspects of the interview. When
Seidel said that Nichols would be interviewed in an Executive
Session, Phillips asked that he be permitted to confer with
FBI Headquarters as it would require clearance from the

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI

Attorney General (AG) before Nichols would be able to testify.
Such AG clearance vas inmediately obtained telephonically
through FBI Headquarters and Phillips advised Nichols,
Seidel and Mr. John Smith, of the office of Senator Walter D.
Huddleston of the Committee that clearance for the interview
had been obtained from the AG provided the interview was
within the scope of the aforementioned areas. Phillips
further indicated that if Nichols believed the interview
was outside the scope, he could invoke 16.22, Code of Federal
Regulations. Arrangements were made for the Executive
Session to take place in the nearby old Carroll Arms Hotel
while Phillips remained at the BBC offices in the event he was
needed for consultation purposes.

The Executive Session took place in Room 607 of
the old Carroll Arms Hotel and lasted approximately for the
period from 10:40 a.a., to 1:15 p.m. Present in addition to
Seidel, Bayly and Smith, were a male reporter and
Senator Huddleston who administered the oath to Nichols,
remained about twenty minutes and who asked only a few
questions. At the outset of this session, Seidel furnished
Nichols the Rules of Procedure of the BSC, including Senate
Resolution 21. Nichols was permitted to look at the Rules
of Procedure and after a brief review, he told Seidel he was
satisfied as to the 88C authority and that they could proceed
with the questioning. Nichols was advised of his rights,
including that to counsel.

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

Nichols was questioned about the communist background
of Levison. He replied that he could not discuss this matter
because it would jeopardize an FBI source. Nichols indicated
that he did not know the identity of the source. Seidel,
who did most of the questioning throughout the session, then
asked Nichols a series of questions attempting to determine
whether the source was a technical one, a foreign one, a
"Soviet" one, also naming several other types. Nichols'
answer in each case was that he did not know. At one point,
Seidel claimed that Nichols had said it was a foreign source.
Nichols then stated he did not recall having so stated and
that if he had so stated, it was wrong as he did not know
the source. Seidel then asked how Nichols knew that the
information he had would disclose the source if he was
unaware of the source's identity. Nichols responded that
inasmuch as he knew in advance the interview would include
the subject of Levison, he had asked Phillips of the FBI
what he could discuss about Levison. Nichols then related
that Phillips had asked Nichols what he knew or recalled about
Levison's background and that when he gave Phillips certain
information, Phillips told him that that information would
possibly identify the source and, therefore, would be
privileged. (The Nichols-Phillips exchange referred to here
took place during the early morning of that same day, May 30,
1975).

Court Seal [JFK Law 10 (a)1]

Seidel questioned Nichols concerning alleged harassment of King by the FBI and mentioned such specific allegations as the following: Sending of a tape recording to Mrs. King; anonymous telephone calls to attempt to cancel press meetings by King; false fire alarms; and furnishing of information about King to the clergy and the news media, including an Atlanta editor, Ralph McGill. In each instance during this phase of the questioning, which Nichols described as rather extensive by Seidel, Nichols answered that he did not participate in any such actions and was unaware that any such things were being done. He also told Seidel that he knew of no COINTELPRO (counterintel- ligence) activity on the part of the FBI against King.

Nichols was asked if he had contacts at Atlanta, Georgia, Police Department (PD) in the King investigation which Nichols acknowledged he had been assigned to in 1964. Nichols answered that he had confided in one detective in the security detail of the PD and on the urging of Seidel, Nichols furnished the detective's identity as Sergeant Bobby Moore.

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI

Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

CONFIDENTIAL

Nichols was questioned as to what type of
investigation concerning King was conducted besides the
use of a technical surveillance. Nichols replied that he
had attempted to initiate action to infiltrate the SCLC
with live informants but that every one of his suggestions
along this line was turned down by FBI Headquarters. Nichols
furnished the reason for these rejections as being that the
FBI did not want to interfere with civil rights organisations
but indicated that the Bureau had never told him this in
the rejections and that it was his own rationale. Nichols
indicated that from time to time spot physical surveillances
would take place in Atlanta to verify contacts between King
and individuals known or suspected of being communists.
During this phase of the interview, Seidel mentioned the name
of Harry Wachtel and Nichols acknowledged he was one of
King's contacts. In response to a question as to whether or
not trash or mail covers were used against King, Nichols
responded that they were not.

Inquiry was made as to why so much reliance was
placed by the FBI on technical coverage of King and so little
was done in the way of physical surveillances. Seidel
pointed out that a technical surveillance of an individual
was a greater infringement of his privacy than was a physical
surveillance. Nichols responded that the Bureau did what it
felt was necessary to get the information it needed. Seidel
then asked Nichols how he would personally feel about a
technical surveillance on him, Nichols. Nichols' response
was that he would rather have his phone tapped than to always
be followed around.

Nichols was questioned concerning the authority for
the technical surveillance of King and how Nichols would
learn of such authority. Nichols explained that he would be

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI

Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

called into the office of the Special Agent in Charge and
told that advice from the Bureau had been received that the
technical surveillance vas authorized. When inquiry was
made concerning the mechanics of installing the surveillance,
Nichols answered that he had nothing to do with this phase.
On questioning, Nichols discussed the monitoring plant
he had set up with a cover company and Nichols gave the general
location of the plant. Nichols indicated that he did not know
who actually made the installation and was asked if an
Al Miller was the sound man in the office. Nichols
acknowledged that he was and when asked if Nichols had
monitored the surveillance, Nichols indicated he had on a
spot basis.

Nichols was questioned and furnished information
of a biographical and personal nature. It included such
things as the period of time he was assigned in Atlanta, the
period of time assigned security work, the King case and
criminal work, as well as when and why he had been transferred
from Atlanta to Oklahoma City. Seidel brought up the matter
of Nichols' testimony in Houston, Texas, in connection with
an FBI case concerning the heavyweight boxer Cassius Clay.
On questioning, Nichols acknowledged he had been transferred
to Oklahoma City because of what the Bureau considered his
deficiencies in his testimony in that case. Seidel inquired
as to what actually Nichols had done wrong and Nichols
replied that he had received a letter of censure but had thrown
it away and cannot now recall the specific deficiencies for
which he was censured. He only recalled that his testimony
was considered not up to Bureau standards. Seidel then asked,
"What are the Bureau standards? Didn't you tell the truth?"
Nichols responded that there was no question as to the
truthfulness of his testimony, that he had told the truth.

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

Nichols was questioned about his contacts with
another retired FBI Agent, Alan Sentinella, to whom the King
case was assigned after it had been handled by Nichols.
Nichols was asked if he had discussed his forthcoming
testimony with Sentinella who resides in Atlanta. Nichols
acknowledged that he had had a discussion with Sentinella
but that they had both purposely avoided any discussion of the
substance of Nichols' testimony-to-be and the testimony which
Sentinella had already given the SSC. They discussed only
procedural aspects as Nichols wanted to have some idea in
advance as to what might be expected in any trip to Washington
to testify. It was Nichols' impression that Seidel thought
that Nichols was holding out some information on this matter.

On at least three occasions Seidel inquired of
Nichols as to whether he had discussed his forthcoming
testimony with Charles Harding of Atlanta, a retired FBI
Agent who had also been acquainted with the King case in 1964.
On each ocasion, Nichols denied that he had had any discussion
with Harding on this matter.

Nichols was questioned as to whether the technical
surveillance on King was justified and his response was that
it was justified. When asked why, Nichols stated that there
was considerable evidence of communist influences on King
inasmuch as King was receiving much advice in his work from
Levison and other communists. Seidel asked if they included
Jack O'Dell and Harry Wachtel and Nichols acknowledged that
it did. When Nichols was asked as to whether or not he had
developed any information as to the communist background of
Levison, O'Dell or Wachtel, Nichols responded that he had
not and that the information was developed by others.

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

At one point, when Seidel asked about alleged
harassment by the FBI, Nichols told him of FBI investigations
of church burnings in South Georgia and that the Bureau
recognized outstanding work by its Agents in this field
and that some of the Agents, including Nichols, had received
meritorious awards. Nichols indicated that he had been
commended for his work generally in civil rights investigations.

When asked about what the FBI was doing in the King
case besides use of wiretaps, Nichols advised that he had
attended a conference at FBI Headquarters to explore avenues
of investigation that might be pursued in the King case.
The objective was to discuss ways of better determining the
extent of the communist influences on King. Nichols furnished
the names of the following FBI personnel as attending the
conference: Agents Henry Rouse and Nichols from Atlanta;
and from FBI Headquarters, Assistant Director William C.
Sullivan, and Agents Larry Gurley and Fred Baumgardner.
(Nichols advised that also attending the conference was
a Bureau official, Joseph Sizoo, but that he did not furnish
this name during his testimony as he did not then recall his
presence at the conference). Nichols told the SSC that he
could not remember what decisions were made at the conference.

Nichols vas questioned concerning a dispute between
King and former FBI Director Hoover which had been aired by
the news media. Nichols was asked if the dispute was the
reason for technical coverage of King and Nichols answered
that he was convinced that that was not the reason for the
technical coverage; that such coverage was otherwise fully
justified. Nichols pointed out that the investigation of
King was initiated before the dispute although it was his
recollection that the technical coverage started after the
dispute.

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

Attempt was made by Seidel to question Nichols concerning FBI investigation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee but Nichols refused to discuss the matter on the basis it was outside the parameters of the testimony.

Nichols was questioned concerning an alleged visit of William C. Sullivan to Atlanta to see the newspaper editor, Ralph McGill. This discussion was initiated in the context of the allegation that the FBI furnished information about King to the news media. Nichols responded that he did not remember Sullivan ever coming to Atlanta.

Nichols was asked if he knew about the writing of a monograph about King by an FBI Agent named Charles Brennan. Nichols responded that he did not know of this.

Nichols advised that he was offered the opportunity to make a statement at the beginning of his testimony but declined to do so. He was given the same offer at the close of his testimony and he made a statement to the following effect. Nichols believed that the Bureau had always conducted the King investigation with the objective of determining the extent of communist influences on King and on the SCLC and that the only way to make a determination as to the full extent required technical coverage. Nichols pointed out that the Bureau never interfered in the legitimate civil rights activities of individuals or organizations or harassed such people and that it was Nichols' belief that FBI personnel were doing what they were being paid for when they conducted legitimate investigations revolving around communisa and communist influences in civil rights activities.

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI

Also at the conclusion of the testimony, Nichols
was told that a draft of the testimony would be made available for
him to review for editing purposes. The SSC would telephone
Nichols who was returning to Atlanta to advise him the draft would
be available and Nichols would have five days to review same.
Nichols was told that the draft could not be mailed to him but
that someone might bring it to Atlanta; otherwise, Nichols would
have to return to Washington, D. C., if he wanted to review it.
Expenses for such a second trip were not mentioned.

On June 2, 1975, Nichols telephoned FBI Headquarters
from Birmingham, Alabama, where he was temporarily residing
and advised he recalled the following additional details of
what was covered in his testimony.

Seidel asked Nichols if information received through
technical coverage included information relating to

> Court Seal [JFK Law 10(a)1]

Senator Huddleston asked Nichols how it would be
possible to follow the Bureau instruction precisely and Nichols
responded that it would be very difficult to comply and in some
instances, it would not be possible. Seidel then commented,
"Why - because of the nature of the beast?" (wiretap).

Re: Testimony of Retired FBI
Special Agent (SA) Robert R.
Nichols Before SSC Executive Session

> CONFIDENTIAL

John Smith of Senator Huddleston's office asked the
difference between a bug and a wiretap and Nichols responded
that a bug was a microphone implanted on the premises whereas
a wiretap was an interception of a telephone line. Smith then
asked if there was a bug on King or the SCLC in Atlanta and
Nichols responded "not to my knowledge." Seidel asked about
any other places in Atlanta where there may have been bugs on
King and Nichols advised he had no knowledge of any. Seidel
asked if Nichols was familiar with a Willard Hotel (Washington,
D. C.) incident involving King and Nichols responded that he
was not.

NOTE:

Original and one copy to the Attorney General copy
for forwarding to the White House. Debriefing of Nichols,
including telephonic contact from him 6/2/75, by S. F. Phillips.

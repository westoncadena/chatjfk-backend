2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

20 April 1977

SUBJECT: Identification of Sensitive Source

The sensitive source cited in paragraph 4, page 29, of Book V - Final Report of SSC to Study Governmental Operations - was an audio operation against the Cuban Embassy in Paris, France encrypted UNSUERRA. It is defunct and the files are retained in Archives in Warrenton. The French Desk will order for us if needed.

A copy of the referenced communication, PARI 1664 (IN 69266) dated 27 November 1963, is attached. It was located in Volume 4 of Rolando CUBELA's official file, 201-252234. UNSNAFU-12, cited in paragraph 3 of that cable, is Marta FRAYDE, a Cuban alternate delegate to UNESCO and an unwitting FI source at that time.

Please note that a copy of this cable was provided to Mr. Breckinridge to carry to a meeting on 11 June 1976 with Senators Hart and Schweiker.

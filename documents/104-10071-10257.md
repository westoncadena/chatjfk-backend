FYI

1. During a recent training period on interrogation with a HUGLIB Case Officer, the point of getting information from suspects on their international contacts or information that might help other services was stressed. Apparently, as a result, the HUGLIB Case Officer dug into his notes on the interrogation of Ricardo Ismael VALLECILLO Perez, Guatemalan FAR member, and came up with the following information which he thought WOFIRM might want to pass to the [Mexican Service][^1]

2. VALLECILLOS stated (the interrogation took place in December, 1967) that FAR was awaiting the arrival of new type machine-pistol called the Red Star (Estrella Roja) from Cuba. He stated that it was a 28 shot weapon and would be issued to commanders of Guerrilla Groups to replace the present Browning semi-autos. He then added that the individuals in charge of shipping weapons and money to the FAR were two officials of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Their names are Alfredo MIRAMBAL Diaz and Adelo (or Abeldo) CALOME Ibarra. The HUGLIB) officer stated that VALLECILLOS blurted this information out in reply to a sarcastic remark made by the Case Officer about the efficacy of the FAR gun-running mechanism.

3. HUGLIB-10 has given this permission to pass this information to the [Mexican Service][^1] if it is considered of any value by WOFIRM.

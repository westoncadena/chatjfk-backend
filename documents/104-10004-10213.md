MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

**SUBJECT**: Discussion with Warren Commission Staff Member

**REFERENCE**: Letter from J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the President's Commission, to Mr. Richard Helms dated 3 July 1964

> O SR/CI discussion with SLAWSON 9 July on questions
> of Soviet policy trends. Russian visas of Americans and
> VISA procedures.

1. With the approval of C/SR and the DDP, I met with Mr. W. David Slawson of the staff of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy at 1400 hours on this date in the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies in material provided the Commission by CIA and by the Department of State which were called to our attention in a letter from the General Counsel of the Commission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.

2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the Commission's report that he was writing, he would have to deal with the question of whether or not the OSWALDs' departure from the USSR - and the circumstances (i.e. timing) of that departure - were unusual or suspicious in any way. He expressed his belief that they probably were not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters in the post-Stalin era. However, he wanted to be sure in his own mind that our information was not in conflict with that which the Commission had received from State since all of that information would remain in the records of the Commission.

3. After stating my belief that there was no real disagreement or inconsistency between the information from CIA and that from State, I expressed the view that the matter resolved itself into three questions:

/a. Do the Soviet

a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals to emigrate from the Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?

b. Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to accompany (i.e. depart simultaneously with) their spouses from the Soviet Union?

c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get Soviet exit visas for such a purpose (time lapse from application to granting of visas)?

4. Concerning the first two questions (3a and 3b above) I pointed out that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Sovie: citizens being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only with the larger question of Soviets married to foreigners being allowed to emigrate without reference to whether or not they left simultaneously with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson commented that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and State had said in that light.

5. By way of further explanation, I said that the statements in paragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on a review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. In only four of these cases did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of her foreign husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit us to categorize them. I added that although State's information began by citing the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December 1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.

16. In response to

6. In response to a question from Mr. Slawson I stated that most of the 26 cases upon which we based our statements involved foreign students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons, and while a number of cases have certain points in common, they bear little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none involved a defector who married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April 1964 memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson indicated that he was now satisfied on this matter.

7. Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to process exit visas for Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals (question 3c above), I stated that, in my opinion, the information provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter) substantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson asked if it would be possible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum of 6 April by providing a statistical breakdown of the cases on which our statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.

8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies bad been resolved. However, he asked that we send a brief written reply to the Commission's letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning the basis for statements included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum. [This would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet visa applications.]

9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to CIA for checking as to their accuracy. He did not say when this would occur.

10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawson, I read Volume 52 of the transcript of testimony before the Commission. This included the reinterview of Marina OSWALD.

In three cases there was a lapse of several acnths between application and issuance of the Soviet exit riss (five months in one case, six in the second, and nine in the third). In another case the bestern husband was reluctant to leave the USSR without his fortet allee the did so soxe six months after the wedding only because the Soviet author-itics told him that her exit application could not be processed until he bad left. The visa was issued-only about six weeks after his departure, but it may have teen applied for when they were married or at any time during the next six months.

In four other cases it is possible to infer approximate tire limits for the granting of an exit visa. One was granted within four to five months, the second within six to sever. xonths, the third within nine months, and the fourth within eleven months. In three additional cases visa issuance took a kinisur of seven, eleven, and twelve months respectively.

1. Paragraph 6. of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 was a response to question 13 of your memorandum of 12 March 1964 entitled: Questions Posed by State Department Files. That question read as follows:

"At the time that L.H. OSWALD and M. OSWALD left Russia for the United States was it legal and normal under Soviet law and practice for a Russian national married to an American to be able to accompany him back to his homeland? Was the rapidity with which L.H. OSWALD was able to accomplish this and Marina's return in any way unusual?"

2. Our reply addressed itself to the legality and normality of Soviet citizens accompanying (i.e.: departing simultaneously with) foreign spouses out of the USSR. It was based on a review of 26 cases, of which 16 involved Americans, in which foreign nationals married Soviet citizens in the USSR. In only four of these 26 cases, did the Soviet wife leave the Soviet Union in the company of her husband. In one of these four cases, an Italian Communist / Party member married


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

Party member married in the USSR and by prevailing upon the Italian Embassy to hold up Italian visas for Soviet seamen, was able to arrange for his wife to accompany him to Italy. In two more of the cases, an American met his future wife on a visit to the USSR, married her on a subsequent trip, and brought her back to the U.S. No detals are available on the fourth case, which involved a Swedish student who married a Soviet student and apparently brought her out with him.

3. In 14 of the remaining cases, a foreign husband (in one case a wife) departed alone. In another case the wife preceded her husband because he had been jailed a month or two previously for violation of travel regulations and in 7 additional cases the sequence is not known.

4. The information in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter regarding length of time taken by Soviet authorities to process visa applications of Soviet wives of American citizens substantially corresponds with the conclusions which we expressed in paragraph 7 of our nemorandum of 6 April 1964. The material from Mr. Meeker provides useful additional data

/regarding Soviet visas


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

regarding Soviet visa processing, and does not materially alter the conclusions stated in paragraph 6 of our memorandum. We feel that any apparent inconsistencies may stem from the different approaches to the problem by the State Department and this Agency.

to Westerners.
Used in repairing reply to memo re-apparent inconsistencies between CIA & State.

1. On 9 July 1964 Mr. W. David Slawson and a representative of CIA discussed the question of apparent inconsistencies in material provided the Commission by CIA and by the Department of State. At that time the question was resolved to Mr. Slawson's satisfaction, and it was agreed that CIA would furnish a statistical breakdown of the cases on which CIA based the statements in paragraph 7 of its memorandum of 6 April 1964.

2. Paragraph 7 of the 6 April memorandum addressed itself to the legality and normality of Soviet citizens departing the USSR simultaneously with their foreign spouses. Statements were based on a review of 26 cases (ten involving Americans) in which foreign nationals married Soviet citizens in the USSR. In only three of these 26 cases did the Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of her husband. In two of the cases an American met his future wife on a visit to the Soviet Union, married her on a subsequent trip, and brought her back to the U.S. No details are available on the third case, which involved a Swedish student who married a Soviet student and apparently brought her out with him. In


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

parted alone. In one more of the 23, the wife preceded her husband because he had been jailed a month or two previously for violation of travel regulations, and In the seven other cases the sequence is not known.

3. The information in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter regarding length of time taken by Soviet authorities to process visa applications of Soviet wives of American citizens substantially corresponds with the conclusions which we expressed in paragraph 7 of the our 6 April memorandum. In eleven of the 26 cases, this time period is known fairly definitely or can be inferred. In three cases it took from five to nine months. Inferring in the other eight cases, three took about six months, two more were issued in not more than nine to eleven months, and three took a minimum of seven to twelve months. Apparent inconsistencies between these statistics and those provided by the State Department undoubtedly arise from a difference in approach by the State Department and CIA.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

In three cases there was a lapse of several months between application and isscance of the Soviet exit visa (five months in one case, six in the second, and nine in the third). In another case the Western husband was reluctant to leave the USSR without his Soviet wife. He did so some six months after the wedding only because the Soviet authorities told him that her exit application could not be precessed until he had left. The visa was issued only about six weeks after his departure, but it may have been applied for when they were married or at any time during the next six months.

In four other cases it is possible to infer approximate time limits for the granting of an exit visa. One was granted within four to five months, the second within six to seven months, the third within nine months, and the fourth within eleven months. In three additional cases visa issuance took a minimum of seven, eleven, and twelve months respectively.

See 201-234750 on Tamara S.KUNGUROVA.

On his second trip to the USSR in January 1959, Philip Robert NIELSON, *REDS KIN agent*, was given an INTURIST interpreter/guide named Tamara Stepanovna KUNGUROVA, A romance developed between them and NIELSON became determined to marry her, which he finally did in the spring of 1962. His family did everything in their power to discourage this romance and John Hafnes of the State Deptartment received letter from NIELSON's father re affair.Not seeking help but advice on what to do.

NIELSON later received letter from his father in fall 1960 giving in details the contents of a conversation father had had with John Hanes of State. Hanes stated that:

a. All American-Soviet marriages had turned out to be unsuccessful.

b. The Soviets never let one of their nationals out of the country under such circumstances unless the person had been recruited as a spy.

c.The Soviets will prctably not given NIELSON a visa (he tried unsuccessfully all summer and fall 1960 and in 1961 to get Scv visa).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

With regard to the marriage of a Soviet to a foreigner, Nora KORZHENKO(who married a British diplomat in the 1940's) has this to say: "Host of the women who have married foreigners must have agreed at one time or another to carry out some cort of spy work for the Soviets. Otherwise, they would not have been given permission to marry foreigners, for even the marriage certificate has to be issued by the secret police."

Nora, herself, was recruited by State Security through coercion and only allowed to leave the country by agreeing to work for Sombot State Security. This she never did because once out of the country, she broke completely with the Soviets and it is presumed that she has furnished information on that organization to the British Services. ( *I Spied for Stalin*, by Nora Murray).

Petr DERYABIN, State Security officer who defected in 1954, has this to say about the Soviet women who have contact with or who marry foreigners:

Soviet women associating with foreign men will be recruited by State Security when the association is first begun, or after it has developed, or when plans for marriage have been made. " Even if only 5% of these women are 100% loyal State Security workers, and the others work less loyally, it is still considered a worthwhile operation. No woman known to be anti-Soviet would ever be given a visa to leave the country, even if she were married to an ambassador. The Soviets instruct all persons in this category to make remarks against the Soviet Union when abroad, but these remarks are not to be too strong, nor are they made for publication by press or radio."

In the early 1960s, when anyoung American was thinking of marrying an INTURIST guide, his father contacts a knowledgeable official of the State Department who made the following remarks:

1.  All American-Soviet marriages had turned out to be unsuccesful
2.  The Soviets never let one of their natioanls out of the country under such circumstances (marriage to a foreigner) unless the person had been recruited as a spy.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

It is believed that the Counterintelligence Directorate, *KRIfport* (Kontrrazvedyvatelnoye upravheniye-KRU), of the KGB initiates operations against foreigners inside the USSR, When the operation leads outside the USSR into foreign countries,i.e., when the probatle recruitments have been achieved, and the persons in question leave the USSR, the operation is thôn turned over to the Foreign Intelligence Directorate (Inostrannoye upravleniye-
which
INU) who continues the operation until such time as it is terminated.

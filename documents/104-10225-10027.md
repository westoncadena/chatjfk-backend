HAS BELIEVES EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS FOR AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SOVIET AND/OR CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING POLITICAL PRISONERS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COUBLD DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. Y

2. THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH A NEUTRAL SPONSOR AND SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY. EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE OFFER TO RELEASE IMPORTANT CHILEAN

PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS
MEDIA IN ALLENDE'S CHILE

HIGHLIGHTS

-- Since President Allende's electoral victory in 1970, the Government propaganda apparatus has mounted a coordinated campaign against the opposition communications media focusing on the prestigious *El Mercurio* newspaper chain and key opposition radios. The long- range goal is to create conditions that will insure Government control over the media so that an emasculated opposition will operate intuitively and through self-censorship within an approved framework.

-- The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal and illegal devices designed to intimidate them. These devices include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of essential Government advertising revenue, temporary closures, and Government-fomented strikes.

-- Chile's national television -- the only country-wide channel -- has become an important propaganda instrument for the Government. But it is being challenged by a Catholic University channel which is attempting to expand its service beyond the Santiago area.

-- A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition, lasting more than a year, has taken place at the *Papelera*, Chile's only important private newsprint producer, with the company supported by the opposition media stymying repeated Government efforts to take over the firm. The paper company claims that Government price policies have brought it close to bankruptcy.

-- Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the opposition media have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political situation currently prevailing in Chile, and have become increasingly effective in exploiting the Government's economic failures and the growing dissension within the ruling Marxist coalition.

-- Nevertheless, the opposition's economic base that sustains its media is being slowly undermined as the Government expands its control over the Chilean economy. Many opposition media are reportedly already in difficult financial straits. The Chilean Communist Party, seeking to strengthen its voice in the March 1973 Congressional elections, has already purchased five beleaguered radio stations (one a former opposition station) in southern Chile.

III. THE ALLENDE PROCESS - HOW THE MEDIA ARE TREATED

Allende's treatment of the opposition media and his utilization of the pro-Government media offer revealing insights into the unique claim that Chile will carry out a Socialist revolution within the frame- work of traditional bourgeois and democratic institutions without social cost.

Any Chilean government possesses wide powers that can be employed to control and intimidate media opponents given sufficient will power and cynicism to do so, despite the fact that media freedoms in Chile are twice-guaranteed, both in the 1925 constitution and in a statute of constitutional guarantees agreed to by Allende's Popular Unity coalition and the Christian Democrats (PDC) as a condition for PDC support for Allende in the congressional run-off held subsequent to the Presidential election in September 1970.

What are some of these powers? Any Chilean executive under provisions of the State Internal Security Law may establish emergency zones by decree headed by military commanders empowering the State to enforce news censorship and to restrict access to newsprint supplies. A law on publicity abuses empowers the government to petition the courts to suspend access to news and information. (Laws on the books that pose potential threats to freedom of radio information are more severe and more frequently utilized. See Section III. B. Radio.). Furthermore, through the judicious parceling out of advertising from State and autonomous State firms any government can discriminate against opposition media by denying or restricting this key source of revenue.

Unlike predecessor governments which utilized existing laws and accepted practices to reward political associates and benefit business partners, the Allende Government has consistently and frequently applied these measures to harass, to intimidate, and to undermine the morale of political and class opponents in the media. These tactics are applied throughout the country.

A basic organizational technique for the UP coalition has been the establishment of UP committees (CUP -- *Comité de Unidad Popular*) -- composed of newsmen who are militant meinbers of parties belonging to the Government coalition or independent supporters of UP policies in newspapers, radios, magazines, and in journalistic bodies. The CUP's have been most active at the union level: demanding exorbitant wage increases, insisting that UP employees Le given the right to express their opinion on editorial pages, disrupting legitimate union meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company data to the leftist press and to the Government.

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding freedom of the press was most explicitly and revealingly stated by the organizing committee for a conference of leftist journalists which was held in Santiago in April 1971. The committee issued the following statement prior to the conference:

...we believe that we must fight for true freedom of the press, which will only be possible when there is true economic independence. We maintain that Chile will have true freedom of the press only when the means of mass communication are part of the area of social property, that is, (when they) belong to all Chileans..
The press, radio, television, and the theater must be tools at the service of liberation and culture of our people and not a private business, an ideological battering ram of the national and foreign minority (the capitalists) as is presently the case.7 (under-lining added)

Another statement said "the mission of journalists is to support and defend the People's Government (the UP) together with all the workers." The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen for "Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism, " and threw a bouquet at Cuba's *Prensa Latina* agency for its "objective" reporting of the Chilean phenomenon. Allende himself lent legitimacy to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conference when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act as the "vanguard" of the revolution by "elevating the political level of the people." Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende asserted that his Government would respect freedom of information while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessive tolerance" for the opposition media.

In the key Santiago metropolitan area, there are five major opposition daily newspapers and one important neutral daily, *La Tercera de la Hora,*

TABLE 2. MAJOR OPPOSITION AND NEUTRAL DAILY NEWSPAPERS

| Title                 | Estimated Circulation | Political Orientation         |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| El Mercurio           | 160,000               | Independent, conservative     |
| Las Noticias Ultimas  | 120,000               | Part of the Mercurio chain    |
| La Prensa             | 25,000                | Christian Democratic (PDC)    |
| La Segunda            | 60,000                | Part of the Mercurio chain    |
| La Tribuna            | 25,000                | National Party (Pi) interests |
| La Tercera de la Hora | 190,000               | Independent                   |

A favorite target of the Government and its propaganda apparatus has been the conservative, independent daily *El Mercurio,* dean of the Chilean press and chief representative of the largest and most influential newspaper chain in the country. Tarred regularly as "pro-U.S." and as a "gringo newspaper written in Spanish" potent accusations in Chile *El Mercurio* has borne the brunt ofjevery conceivable kind of pressure short of outright seizure.

On numerous occasions the paper has been implicated along with other opposition media in alleged seditious plots carried out in concert with foreign (i.e.. U.S.) interests to overthrow the Government. Advertisers have been "requested" not to do business with the *Mercurio* chain, which has been accused of foreign exchange irregularities by tax authorities, by Government supporters on the paper's own staff, and by Allende himself at public rallies. Allende, too, periodically reacts to critical *Mercurio* editorials with charges that Chile and the Presidential office have been "insulted," that the *Mercurio* chain indulges in "libertinism unprecedented in Chilean journalistic history,"

and that the chain is "faithful to its tradition of infarmy." The Government propaganda apparatus follows suit.

The PDC organ *La Prensa* and the National Party tabloid *La Tribuna* are secondary targets for the UP propaganda apparatus because their circulation is limited. Pressures employed against these dailies are aimed generally at the political parties behind them in contrast to the *Mercurio* chain where pressures are intended as a warning signal to the "free" media as an institution.

Independent *La Tercera* receiven distinct treatment. The Government exerts minimal pressures on the paper in return for favorable editorial treatment of Allende policies (see Section VI. A. The Opposition Media Reaction). This tactic has paid dividenda for Allende and for *Tercera's* owner, German Pico Canas. Allende obtains favorable publicity in a mans-circulation paper that maintains comparative objectivity in its news columns, thus lending credence to Allende's claims that he will respect traditional Chilean freedoms while making the transition to Socialism, Freed frora the need for the strident partisanship so characteristic of the rest of the press, *Tercera* steadily builds its circulation with a public seeking some reliei from the verbal civil war. As a result Pico, who has been head of the Chilean newspaper association, has defended the Allende Government's press policies in international forums. The under- standing with the Government, however, is an uneasy one; *Tercera* is not sufficiently malleable for the Socialist Party, the principal party in the Government coalition.[^9]

B. Radio

Radio continues to be the most important medium of communication in Chile. The latest available figures compiled by the World Radio-TV Handbook give Chile a total of 137 stations, including 29 in the capital city. Santiago (See Table 3). The number of receivers is estimated at 3 million, or one for every third person. In a country 2,600 miles long radio's strategic importance is understood by both Government and opposition. The Government has resorted to a variety of device's designed to intimidate opposition radio stations: requests by Allende advisers that opposition stations hire designated leftist commentators; threats of violence; favoritism in the distribution of needed government advertising revenues; temporary closures; and strikes fomented by CUP committees.

| Radio Portales        | Socialist Party                                                                |

| Radio UTE             | State Technical University station controlled by Communists                    |

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stations must rest with "bourgeois" radio owners. Long before Allende became president the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio stations made it a practice to hire leftist commentators because they believed that leftists were superior professionals and helped to increase listenership. When the UP came to power it tapped an existing source of manpower.

In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations to gain its ends. Radio concessions are granted by a Government entity (*Servicios Electricos*) attached to the Interior Ministry. The same entity can cancel or transfer such concessions. Regulations promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the rules, control, and censorship that the Government may adopt." Under this type of emergency regulation, all radio stations were placed under an obligatory Government network - not an unusual practice for the Allende Government - when a modified martial law was decreed in 21 of Chile's 25 provinces during the October-

November 1972 truck drivers strike (See Note No. 18). Another regulation decrees that stations must interrupt their transmissions whenever the Interior Minister judges it to be necessary in the interest of the internal security of the State. Still another regulation authorizes the Central Bank to control the importation of equipment and spare parts for radio, television, and the press.

The Government moved quickly after the 1970 presidential election to obtain control of key stations. The Socialist Party gained control of Radio Portales, Chile's most popular station, and purchased Radio Corporación from El Mercurio (Portales has subsequently slipped in popularity). The Communist Party purchased Magallenes, an important Santiago station. The Communist Party recently also purchased Radio Simón Bolívar (formerly pro-opposition) in Concepción (as well as four other stations in southern Chile in preparation for the Congressional elections in March 1973). The rightist National Party daily La Tribuna quoted the former owner as saying that "the age of privately-owned mass media (in Chile) is over" with only the Government, strong economic consortiums, and the most powerful political parties capable of sustaining media operations. La Tribuna says the Corarounist Party is now the most powerful (single) broadcaster in southern Chile.

PDC-oriented Radios Balmaceda and Cooperativa, however, have to date successfully resisted Government enticements and pressures (see Section VI. A. The Opposition Media Reaction). Palmaceda -- a radio station which over the years had carned a reputation for objective newscasts -- has been the number one target of the UP in the radio field. It has suffered more temporary closures than any radio facility. The station was shut down, for example, 17 hours in June 1971 for broadcasting an alleged "alarmist" report during the State of Emergency decreed after the assassination of Perez Zujovic, a former interior minister in the Frei Government. At the same time a UP station, Portales, received nothing more than an admonition for transmitting "alarmist" news more acceptable to UP propagandists. During the August-September 1971 period Radio Balmaceda was shut down on three separate occasions under similar pretexts (see Note No. 10).

In radio as in the press the Government has used CUP committees to formulate exaggerated wage demands, to forment strikes, and to form ramp unions. CUP unions at Radio Pacifico, for example, forced the owner to sell out to a cooperative formed by employees when wage demands could not be met. The radio station subsequently was purchased by the Radical Party -- a member of the UP coalition.

The principal Governinent weapon, however, is its control over public service advertising, which traditionally has provided the bulk of revenues for Chilean radio stations. The Government has dangled the prospect of advertisements in return for favorable news treatment, but the bait has not been picked up by the major opposition radios which recognize that their independence is at stake. The economic squeeze makes the future of Chilean independent radios appear bleak.

C. Television

Since its inception in Chile in 1962, television has made great strides, but the medium still lags behind radio, especially in the provinces where technical conditions for viewing are poor. According to the best estimates available, there are 350,000 sets in Santiago and a total of 500,000 sets in the country. Chile is served by the following television channels: 1) A national network with some 21 outlets throughout the country; 2) the Catholic University channel in Santiago; 3) a separate Catholic University channel in Valparaíso; and 4) the University of Chilg channel in Santiago.

The Government clearly recognizes television's importance as a propaganda vehicle, and under the direction of an Allende confidante, newsman Augusto Olivares (Socialist and a suspected member of the ultra-left MIR -- Movement of the Revolutionary Left), it has transformed Chile's only nationwide television channel into an outright political instrument of the Government coalition. Slanted commentaries favoring UP policies, character assassinations intended to smear political and class opponents, and a steady drum-fire of Socialist propaganda in news and cultural programming became standard fare.

CONFIDENTIAL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

At the same time network authoritice made it difficult under a variety of pretexts for opposition spokesmen to air their views in contravention of the State television statute, For example, the authorities frequently obliged all television channels and radios to carry official statements and denied opposition spokesmen equal time, resorting to the legal fiction that the official staternents were transmitted voluntarily.

A popular political chat show "A Tres Bandas," in which opposition representatives freely debated UP representatives (the only such show carried nationally), was cancelled in August 1972 after two years of UP agitation against it. The Government defended the step by alleging that the program had poor listenership and by pointing to a ruling granting all political parties equal time to express their views on twice-weekly 20-minute slots. The original chat show format provided several hours of open-ended and frequent face-to-face confrontation, usually embarrassing to the Government.

The University of Chile station has consistently asserted the Marxist line since its inception, but the two remaining university channels have successfully fought Government control to date (Sce Section VI. C. University Confrontation and Television Freedoms). None of the university channels, however, is national in scope.

D. Magazines and Book Publishing

Early in 1971 the Government purchased the plant and equipment of the PDC-controlled Zig-Zag publishing empire - one of the most modern in Latin America. The GOC announced the purchase after prolonged negotiations, provoked originally by the excessive demands of a Communist-led union. Under the terms of the accord the Government purchased Zig-Zag's plant and equipment, the company's national line of comics, and several magazines while Zig-Zag retained several mass-circulation magazines (Ercilla and Vea being the most important) under a two-year contract with the Chilean Treasury. The Zig-Zag infrastructure formed the basis for the newly-established Government-owned Quimantu National Publishing Enterprise. The accord with Zig-Zag has been scrupulously observed to date.

Quimantu quickly began turning out magazines, comic books, and textbooks pushing UP policies. Comic books like *Firme* were designed for mass consumption and aimed at adults with low cultural levels, while others like *Ramona* were aimed at the teen-age market. *Cabrochico*, another comic book, was geared to pre-teens. The format of some Quimantu products closely resembled competing Zig-Zag products. The weekly *Ahora*, for example, was designed to compete with *Ercilla*. After eight months *Ahora* collapsed, rejected in the market place by Chileans who were turned off by heavy-handed political propaganda.

E. Films

The Government's film production company, Chile Films, became the UP's principal propaganda arm in the film field. Rival Chilean private producers went out of business, squeezed by rising production costs and discriminatory tax and exchange rate treatment that denied them needed equipement and spare parts from abroad. Chile Films signed a comprehensive exchange accord in March 1971 with the Cuban Cinematographic Institute (ICAIC) (See Section V. C. *Exchange of Persons, Visitors, and Exchange Agreements*).

Chile Films also initiated agreements with the experimental film institute (leftist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the Communist-dominated State Technical University (UTE), the Government information office, the film department of the Communist-dominated CUT (Central Unica de Trajabadores -- the major labor organization), the national television network, and the University of Chile television station. The stated purpose of the accords was to "develop the new Chilean film industry."

Its products are intended to glorify the roles of workers, peasants, and students in the march to Chilean-style Socialism, romanticize the proletarian role of the Chilean Communist and Socialist Parties, and attack the "bourgeoisie" and their "imperialist" allies. Despite an intense publicity buildup, however, few films actually appeared in the 1970-72 period. Most of the films that were produced appeared to be pieced together from newsreel film taken during the Allende presidential campaign or from post-election political rallies.

The Government's delay in making public the results of June 1972 elections for top posts in the Communist-dominated CUT tabor federation also damaged Government credibility. The opposition media scored heavily in a barrage of charges of irregularities and vote fraud with a public that takes justified price in clean elections.

B. The Papelera Confrontation

The Compañía Manufacturera de Papeles Y Cartones (known as the Papelera), Chile's major private producer of sewsprint, became another propaganda battleground cast by the opposition in terms of "freedom versus Marxist totalitarianism."

In October 1971, the Government, carrying out a long-standing pledge, announced that CORFO (the Government Development Corporation) had opened negotiations to buy out the Papelera through the purchase of its stock. The opposition media inediately launched a campaign to warn the public that the free press would be crippled if newsprint distribution were placed at the mercy of Government suppliers. At the same time, the opposition media pleaded with private shareholders to refuse to sell to the Government. In addition, a "freedom fund" was created enabling private persons to buy up Papelera shares to prevent the company from falling into Government hands.

For several months pro- and anti-Government media carried out daily an intensive propaganda battle in advertisements, news stories, and editorials. Both sides resorted to the familiar numbers game: the pro-Allende media claimed that the Government was besieged by willing shareholders eager to sell out; the opposition asserted that shareholders were resisting temptation. Government propagandists argued that newsprint production was essential to the State and must be controlled by the State; the opposition said Papelera must remain in private hands as a patriotic duty.

Thwarted to date in its attempt to buy out Papelera shareholders, the Government has not hesitated to use other measures -- price controls, labor-induced production shortages, and strong-arm tactics -- to prevent the delivery of raw material to the plant. The Government press also circulated rumors that Jorge Alessandri (former President

CONFIDENTIAL

of Chile and a leading shareholder and board chairman of the *Papelera*) had made a deal with Allende to give the Government control over the *Papelera* to weaken the will of private shareholders and their supporters. That the *Papelera* still withstands these combined pressures a year later is a tribute to a determined defense of the firm by an opposition Congress, to the loyalty of the bulk of the *Papelera* employees, and to an aroused and alerted opposition media.

The battle for control of the *Papelera* will continue and the odds are not good for the company. Repeated requests for price increases sufficient to absorb cost increases forced on the firm in part by Government economic policies were not met, and the firm declared in September 1972 that it could not meet lean payments due to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDR). Finally, in December 1972 the Government authorized new price increases averaging 45 per cent, which were, however, inapplicable to the price of newsprint. The *Papelera* gains some breathing space but Government pressures on the company are certain to continue. The price increase itself may be viewed as a form of pressure.

The battle has spilled over into the halls of the Chilean Congress. Partly to protect the *Papelera*'s independent status, the PDC sponsored a "three areas" constitutional amendment designed to give Congress some control over which businesses can be incorporated as social- property by the Government, (The *Papelera* is one of the firms appearing on the Government's original list of 91 firms to be absorbed by the Government as social property.) The amendment still a bitter bone of contention between the Government and the opposition would, among other points, declare null and void CORFO's attempted purchase of *Papelera* stock in the absence of Congressional approval. [^1]

C. University Confrontation and Television Freedoms

Growing opposition confidence fed by an election victory at the University of Chile in April 1972 and by stiffening opposition attitudes at Santiago's Catholic University had important spill-over effects in television programming at two channels run by Catholic University. Increasing opposition effectiveness even raised the possibility that the Marxist-controlled University of Chile channel for the first time in its existence might be obliged to inject some objectivity into its output.

Incumbent University of Chile Rector Edgardo Boeninger, an independent with Christian Democratic sympathies, gained 51.9 per cent of the vote for rector in April against three other contenders repre- senting the UP coalition and leftist splinter groups, including the MIR. An independent-PDC state alto gained control of the previously Marxist-controlled Superior Nomative Council. The victory was billed by the opposition media as another victory for democracy and pluralisin over Marxist totalitarianism. [^14] In the process tector Boeninger became a hero of the opposition media and a symbol of "democratic" defiance of Government efforts to impose its will on an independent university. The opposition's rallying cry became "Defend a democratic and pluralist university." Translated into media terms it became "We want a democratic and pluralistic university TV channel."

Rallying behind that slogan, opposition supporters at the two Catholic Universities (Santiago and Valparaiso) began to ease out leftist influence in the news departments of the two university channels. UP supporters, however, remain at the technician level at the Santiago channel and can be expected to create problems for their opponents. Opposition authorities who now control the channel are proceeding cautiously against them.

A more significant indication of UP long-range attitudes toward television freedoms has been the Government's persistent refusal to permit university television stations to extend their networks throughout Chile. In September 1972, President Allende blocked the opposition's most recent attempt to obtain legislative sanction for such an extension by vetoing selected iterns in a PDC-introduced bill. The Government claimed that its own bilf pending before Congress and allowing universities to establish stations only within the territory in which the seat of each university is located -- would create a national network for all recognized universities on an "equal and non-discriminatory" basis, What the Government did not say was that the bill if passed would preserve the State Network's position as the only single channel that can be viewed by a national television audience. Presumably the Government bill also would permit the Communist-dominated State Technical University to operate a television station in Santiago in competition with Santiago's Catholic University channel which, according to available public opinion surveys. is viewed by approximately 69 per cent of the capital's audience.

# Allende in Retrospect

By Paul E. Sigmund

World attention has moved away from Santiago since the bloody overthrow of Salvador Allende last September, but the questions that were raised at that time still need answering. Where should the primary responsibility be placed for the tragic events on and after September 11, 1973? Was it, as the Left contends, the result of a fascist counterrevolution aided and abetted by the forces of imperialism? Was it, as the Right asserts, the only available response to Allende's attempt to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat by a mixture of guile and force? Did it mark the "death of a dream" of the establishment of socialism by democratic means, and was it thereby one more demonstration that Marxism must use force to accomplish its goals? Were there internal and external political and economic factors which made it impossible for Allende's experiment to succeed, or was the downfall of the Unidad Popular (Popular Unity) coalition government the consequence of a series of ideologically-influenced analyses and mistaken policy choirces which, if they had been different, might have produced another result? A review of the course of the Allende government with the aid of the considerable new material that has become available in recent months may help to answer these questions.

Allende's opponents never tire of pointing out that he was elected with only 36 percent of the vote in a three-way race. What they do not mention is that in the congressional run-off between the two front-running candidates he was elected president by a lopsided majority vote of 135-35. Ho received the support of the centrist Christian Democratic Party (PDC) in the run-off in return for his agreement to the adoption of a Constitutional Statute of Democratic Guarantees protecting freedoms of expression, education and religion, and guaranteeing the independence of the military from political control. The text of the statute, which was added to the Chilean Constitution shortly after Allende's election, reflected the fears of non-Marxist groups that the new Marxist President would use the considerable power of the Chilean executive to undercut and eventually destroy all opposition to a Marxist take-over.

Mr. Sigmund is Professor of Politics at Princeton University. Among his published works are Models of Political Change in Latin America, 1970, and The Ideologies of the Developing Nations (2nd rev. ed., 1972). He has visited Chile nine times since 1963, most recently in January 1974 to do research on a forthcoming book dealing with Chilean politics.

# Political and Economic Strategy

When he took office, Allende promised that he would follow a "second model" of Marxism—the via Chilena to socialism, "with meat pies and red wine." To prove that this model was "anticipated by the classics of Marxism," he quoted from Friedrich Engels on the possibility of

... a peaceful evolution from the old society to the new in countries where the representatives of the

[^1] Allende's supporters in the Popular Unity coalition consisted of his own Socialist Party (Partido Socialista-PS), the Communist Party (Partido Comunista-PC), the main body of the Radical Party (Partido Radical-PR), the leftist Catholic "Movement of Popular United Action" (Movimiento de Accion Popular Unido-MAFU), and two other smaller groups. The largest opposition groups wore the centrist Christian Democratic Party (Partido Democrata Cristiano-PDC) ard the rightist National Party (Partido Nacional PN)..

In retrospect, it is ironic that the Chilean Senate never acted on a constitutional amendment proposed early in 1970 to establish a second-round popular election, which would have provided the President thus elected (probably the right-wing candidate, Jorge Alessandri) with a clear popular mandate.

'people have all power and in accord with the consti-
tution can do what they desire when they have the
majority of the nation behind them.'

Yet it was precisely the question of majority sup.
port that was Allende's central problem in his de-
sign to carry out a peaceful transition to "socialism
with democracy, pluralism and liberty." The parties
in his coalition were in a distinct minority in the
Congress, and although there was no doubt about the
legitimacy of his election by that body, his victory
had only been possible because of the conditional
support of the Christian Democrats. The PDC, it
should be noted, included both Radomiro Tornic,
the party's 1970 presidential candidate, who had
gone to Allende's house to congratulate him the
day after the popular election, clearly inferring his
future support, and conservatives like Senator Juan
de Dios Carmona, who had fought within the party
to prevent it from voting for Allende in the run-off.
In the immediate aftermath of the election the PDC
was controlled by the Tornic forces, who claimed
to be in favor of "communitarlan" socialism, nation
alization of copper, acceleration of agrarian reform,
and reduction of Chile's dependencia on the United
States. One way, then, for Allende to achieve his
acknowledged goal of majority support for the
transition to socialism would have been to try to
arrive at an understanding with the Christian Demo-
crats on the points in his program with which they
were In agreement. This might have provoked the
secession of some of the rightist members of the
PDC, but if an accord had been reached with the
party's leaders, it would likely have given Allende
a majority in the Congress for at least part of his
program.

Flushed with victory and unwilling to come to
terms with the party which he had termed "the new
face of reaction" during the campaign, Allende chose
an alternative strategy. The next congressional elec
tions were not scheduled to take place until March
1973, but the Chilean Constitution provided that in
the event of a conflict with the Congress over the
text of a constitutional amendment, the President
could call a national plebiscite. The strategic course.
adopted by Allende was to attempt to expand popu-
lar support for his coalition and then propose a
constitutional amendment which, in accordance with
the. Popular Unity electoral program, would replace
the existing bicameral legislature with a unicameral
house, tobe elected immediately following the ap.
proval of the amendment. The Congress would be
certain to reject the amendment, but if Allende
had the support of a majority in the country, he
could win the plebiscite and secure control of the
unicameral legislature that would then be estab-
lished.

Allende's strategy for the expansion of electoral
support was an economic one which drew as much
from John Maynard Keynes as it did from Karl Marx.
The Chilean economy, already operating below
capacity, had gone into a profound recession as a
result of Allende's election. The response of Pedro
Vuskovic, Allende's Minister of Economics, was to
"prime the pump" by adopting a deficit budget, In-
creasing public expenditures, and redistributing in-
come by skewing the annual wage readjustment for
the preceding year's inflation (35 percent in 1970)
in favor of the low-income sector of the population
(the lowest income groups received a 40-percent in-
crease). The utilization of unused industrial ca-
pacity, combined with strict enforcement of price
controls, more stringent collection of taxes, and re-
fusal to devalue the Chilean escudo in relation to
the dollar, were expected to contain possible infla-
tionary pressures which might result. (The Allende
government also had a cushion of nearly $400
million in foreign reserves left to it by the Frei
government as a result of high international prices
for copper, Chile's principal export.)

The strategy also contained a Marxist element-

accentuation of the class struggle. At the same time that appeals were made to the pocketbooks of the lower-class Chileans, there was also to be an effort to increase their class consciousness (concientización) through government publications and the use of the media to remove the elements of "false consciousness" instilled by "bourgeois" propaganda. Expressing the diametric opposite of a claim often voiced by his predecessor, Eduardo Frei, Allende caid in a press conference just after his installation, "I am not president of all Chileans." And in his first "State of the Nation" message to the Congress he asserted:

..... the People's Government (Gobierno Popular) is Inspired in its policy by a premise that is artificially denied by some--the existence of classes and social sectors with antagonistic and opposing interests.

Allende's economic advisers anticipated an additional source of revenue for the government from the "exploitative" profits of the industries that were to be nationalized by the new government. The partially American-owned copper mines were to be taken over by a constitutional amendment--both to lay to rest any legal doubts about the reversal of the Frei Chileanization agreements of 1967 and 1969, and because a general consensus in Chile favored nationalization. Other companies were to be nationalized after a controlling interest was gained through the purchase of shares on the open market by the government development agency. The latter course seemed facilitated by the fact that the price of shares had been depressed since the elections, and further economic pressures could be created by allowing wage increases but forbidding any rise in prices. The legal adviser to the government, Eduardo Novoa, also outlined other "legal loopholes" in existing Chilean law which could be used for "temporary" takeovers of companies, including "intervention" because of labor disputes and "requisition" because of a "breakdown in supply of an article of prime necessity."

Salvador Allende, "The Chilean Way to Socialism," in Paul E. Sigmund, Ed., The ideologies of the Developing Nations, 2nd rev. ed., New York, Praeger, 1972, p. 450.

Frel's Chileanization program had involved the purchase by the Chilean state of a controlling Interest in the large copper mines owned by the Fennecott and Anaconda companies. The agreements had also provided that Chue's payments to the American companies were to te invested in the expansion of copper production and retining in Chile, earning the country additional revenue in the 1970's to pay back the loans contracted to finance the purchases.

Industry and trade, as promised in the Popular Unity The takeover of large sectors of Chile's basic program, was thus seen as an essential part of an economic and political strategy aimed at achieving and maintaining power. Combined with a rapid acceleration of agrarian reform (again using existing legislation-the 1967 agrarian reform law-but exploiting, provisions such as one authorizing the expropriation of "abandoned or badly-farmed land," with one percent payment in cash and the rest in bands), the planned takeover meant that even if the effort to create a unicameral left-dominated legislature falled, the Allende government could cition through a series of "Irreversible" taits accom. destroy the economic base of the "capitalist" opposition through a series of "Irreversible" taits accomplis (hechos consumados) which would give the

government control of the economy and of the excess profits that the private sector had used for luxury consumption or had sent out of the country as profit remittances to foreign companies. At the same time, the fact that the policy remained within the letter, if not the spirit, of the law meant that intervention by the military was unlikely.

Allende's constitutionalist and legalist strategy was not universally accepted within his coalition. Most of his own Socialist Party—beginning with its newly elected General Secretary, Senator Carlos Altamirano--and several other groups further to the left, such as the MIR (Movimiento de la Izquierda Revolucionaria—Movement of the Revolutionary Left) and the VOP (Vanguardia Organizada del Pueblo Organized Vanguard of the People), were openly doubtful about the wisdom of relying on elections and "bourgeois legality" to achieve power and advised preparation for an armed confrontation with the forces of reaction, which they foresaw as inevitable. Allende's effort to portray the transition to socialism as peaceful in character was not assisted by the publication of his conversations with French revolutionary theorist Régis Debray in early 1971.

In these, Debray declared that "in the last analysis and until further notice, political power comes out of the end of a gun," and Allende repeatedly stated that his differences with apostles of violence like Ché Guevara were only "tactical," because the Chilean situation required that he observe legality "for the time being." Allende himself organized an armed personal bodyguard, the so-called GAP (Grupo de Amigos Personales), and—we now know—as early as December 1971 received reports on the illegal importation and distribution of arms to the MIR and to his bodyguards.

While there were thus intermittent hints of revolutionary alternatives, Allende's basic economic strategy was "socialist consumerism," combined with a rapid expansion of state control in industry, trade and agriculture, and his basic political strategy

was an expansion of the electoral base of the Allende | when the regime's popularity was at its highest
coalition by an appeal to the material interests and point, but in retrospect it does not appear at all
the class consciousness of the lower classes. It was certain that he would have won-particularly since
the interaction of the various elements of this politi by the time that the constitutional prerequisites for
cal and economic strategy that finally produced the such a vote had been fulfilled, the economic and
breakdown of Chilean constitutionalism and the political situation would have been much less favor-
intervention of the armed forces that the extreme left able.
of the Allende coalition had been predicting all along.

## Initial Success

At the outset, the new economic policy was
astoundingly successful, although it had within it
the seeds of future disaster. Income redistribution
stimulated demand, while price controls and an arti
ficially low exchange rate kept prices down. As a
consequence, a mini-boom ensued. By March 1971
the Sociedad de Fomente Fabril (Association for the
Development of Manufacturing), representing
Chilean business and industry, admitted that produc-
tion had increased by 6.3 percent over the figure
of 12 months before, and by. May that figure had
reached 13.5 percent. The Institute of Economics
of the University of Chile later reported that unem-
ployment in the Santiago area dropped from 8.3
percent in December 1970 to 5.2 percent in June
1971 and declined further to an unusually low 3.8
percent by the end of the year. The Consumer Price
Index stopped climbing entirely in December 1970
and had only increased by 6 percent by the time
of the municipal elections of April 1971-its lowest
rise in many years. At the same time, salaries and
wages increased by 27 percent in real terms.

This wave of economic prosperity-combined
with the absence of the political repression that
some rightists had predicted would result from a
victory by the Marxists-led many, particularly in
low Income groups, to vote for the candidates of the
Popular Unity coalition in the April municipal elec-
tions. Allende's own Socialist Party bettered its elec
toral showing in the 1969 congressional elections by
nearly 100 percent (a jump from 12 percent to 22
percent of the total), and the candidates of all the
parties supporting Allende received about 50 per
cent of the vote, as compared with the 36 percent
which the President himself had received only seven
months before. Yet, gratifying as the results were,
the coalition was stili a few votes short of the abso-
lute majority that Allende required to win a plebi-
scite on a constitutional amendment. He was later
criticized for not calling the plebiscite at the time

The period after the municipal elections now ap-
pears to have been crucial for the long-term survival
of the regime. The Right was still in disarray, the
Christian Democrats, had elected a compromise
leadership which was not committed to either of the
party's wings, and the short-run economic and politi-
cal indicators were favorable. Yet, instead of taking
action on the economic front to stem the loss of
foreign reserves and to dampen inflationary pres-
sures-and on the political front to prevent the
movement of the Christian Democrats into an alli-
ance with the right-wing opposition parties-the
regime continued its previous policies, confidently
assuming that in the long run "the people" would
support it and ignoring the warnings of "bourgeois"
economists that the loss of foreign reserves, the ex-
pansion of demand, and the sharp decline in invest-
ment would produce disastrous consequences in the
following year.

## Political Polarization

The hardening of the Christian Democratic posi-
tion began in min-1971. It was accelerated in June
by the assassination of the former Christian Demo-
cratic Interior Minister, Edmundo Perez Zujovic, by
extremists, at least one of whom had been released
from prison by Allende upon his accession to power.
A month later in a by-election in Valparaíso, the
victorious Christian Democratic candidate received
the support of the Right. The tacit alliance with the
Right led to the secession from the PDC of eight
deputies and a number of other party leaders to form
the pro-Allende Izquierda Cristiana (Christian Left).
This was counterbalanced however, by a split in the
other direction within the Allende coalition. Five of
the seven Radical senators (including two former
presidential candidates) and 7 of the 19 deputies
left the Radical Party (PR), and formed the Partido
de la Izquierda Radical (Party of the Radical Left-
PIR) in protest against the Marxist orientation of a

PR policy resolution which the dissidents described marches and dernonstrations against the government, as "completely removed from the characteristic and the most famicus of which was the March of Empty distinctive ideology of our party" and opposed to Pots in December 1971, in which thousands of "the interest of the middle social strata" whom the housewives, mostly of middle-class background, party had always represented. For a time, the PIR marched, tanging pots to protest food shortages. continued to support the Allende government, but Those shortages had developed because the pre- within a year it had entered the ranks of the opposi- dicted economic difficulties resulting from the tion. Vuskovic policy began to emerge in late 1971: The balance-of-payments surplus had been depleted at such an alarming rate (in 1971 there was a deficit of $315 million, while in 1970 there had been a surplus of 391 million) that in November 1971 the Allende government called a moratorium on payment of its foreign debts. Chile had already experienced difficulties in securing loans from the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the Export- Import Bank as a result of its failure to compensate the Anaconica and Kennecott copper companies for the nationalization of their major mines. The debt moratorium was bound to make it considerably more difficuit for Chile to secure foreign credits, particularly for the short term. In December 1971, the Chilean government finally permitted a partial devaluation of the Chilean escudo so as to decrease the distortions created by its overvaluation, but this created pressure on prices of goods manufactured with imported components. Shortages of certain food items especially cooking oil, detergents, sugar, toothpaste, and cigarettes were ascribed by the government to upper-class hoarding and to increased consumption by low-income groups; however, the dislocations in the countryside associated with the very rapid expansion of the agrarian reform (Allende took over almost as much land in his first year in office as Frei nad in six years) clearly had something to do with the problem as well, and the situation could be expected to get worse with the harvest in early 1972. A 100-percent increase in the money supply as a result of the government's deficit spend- ing was also beginning to produce inflationary pres- sures now that the unused capacity of Chilean indus- try had been taken up by the 1971 expansion. Most important, a sharp drop in investment (Allende said it had declined by 7.7 percent, but opposition economists claimed it had fallen by 24.2 percent) meant that the spectacular growth rate achieved in 1971 would be sharply reduced in 1972.

In July 1971, the Christian Democrats had voted In favor of the constitutional amendment national izing the copper mines, but from that point forward, the pattern was one of polarization of Chilean politics and society into two opposing blocks. The Allende forces controlled the executive and pursued an in- creasingly vigorous ideological purge of those who were not entirely sympathetic to the government. The opposition controlled the legislature, and in October 1971. the Christian Democrats and the rightist parties attempted to assert legislative con- trol over the expansion of the public sector by voting In favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the use of the intervention and requisition procedures and requiring that all transfers of private enterprises to the "social" or mixed sectors be carried out in accordance with specific legislation adopted by the Congress. This legislative act, referred to as an amendment on the "Three Areas of Property," became the focus of a continuing deadlock between the President and Congress that lasted until Allende's overthrow in September 1973.

Allende's refusal to accept the amendment or to call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the Congress appeared to the congressional opposition to be a decisive indication of his determination to bypass the legislature in carrying out the Popular Unity program, and from the time of the adoption of the amendment onward, the Christian Democrats began to cooperate with the rightist parties in op posing the executive. One method was to impeach ministers for violation or (more often) nonenforce- ment of the law. The first of many such impeach- ments took place in January 1972. Another method was to present a united electoral front against the government. Informal cooperation between the rightist parties and the Christian Democrats led to striking victories in two by-elections in January 1972, and a month later these groups formed the Demo- cratic Confederation (Confederación Democrática CODE) to prepare joint lists for the 1973 congres- sional elections. A third area of cooperation was in

Immediately evident from the figures for 1971, industrial growth had reached 8.3 percent, agrarian production (based on plantings before Allende's accession to power) had increased by 5.3 percent, and unemployment had dropped to record lows. The Communist Party in a report to a Popular Unity "conclave" in early 1972 warned that "very strong inflationary pressures could make our situation acute," but the government took no action to deal with the problem. The continuing optimism ci government policymakers at this time was expressed at a Round Table in Santiago sponsored by the University of Sussex and the Chilean Planning Office in March 1972. In the course of discussion Racemiro Tomic, the defeated Christian Democratic presidential candidate, asserted that the Allende government had committed a "fatal political error" in failing to establish an "institutional majority" in the Congress through a "far-reaching agreement between socialists inspired by Christianity and those inspired by Marxism—that is, between the Christian Democrats and Popular Unity—in the period following the 1970 presidential election." Altencie's representatives confidently replied that "with a gradual heightening of the political consciousness of the proletariat, there seemed to be no obstacles in the internat logic of the Chilean bourgucis state to prevent the workers' winning sufficient strength to gain control of the legislature as well as the executive.""

On the political front, there were individuals and groups on both sides who attempted to stem the movement toward polarization, which they correctly foresaw would lead to the breakdown of Chilean institutions. Two important efforts to arrive at a compromise on the issue of the constitutional amendment on the "Three Areas of Property" were made in the first part of 1972. In April the Left Radicals, who had entered the Allende government in January, carried on lengthy negotiations with the Christian Democrats to harmmer out a satisfactory agreement on this issue, only to have it rejected by the top command of the Popular Unity coalition parties. The Left Radicals responded by leaving the government and joining the opposition, a move Allende described as "a stab in the back." " A second set of negotiations in June between the head of the Christian Democratic Party and Allende's Minister of Justice broke down when the time limit set by the Christian Democrats expired and the PDC leadership refused to extend it.

The two sets of negotiations seem to have collapsed for related reasons. In April the left wing of the Popular Unity coalition was unwilling to accept a compromise which would slow down or stop the forward movement of the government nationalization program, while in June the right wing of the Christian De.nocrats could point to an impending by-election ir. mid-July as a reason for discontinuing discussions. Both cases illustrated a general problem posed by the Chilean multiparty system. Once political conflict became polarized, the extremes held the rest of the opposing coalitions hostage and prevented what could have been a convergence of views in the center.

The negotiations were interspersed with a series of demonstrations and counterdemonstrations by the government and the opposition which always stopped just short of open violence. Several observers, including the American Ambassador to

Chile, Nathaniel Davis, remarked on the pattern of "brinkmanship" that the Chileans exhibited." Social and political tensions increased-but as long as economic deterioration was not reflected in runaway Inflation, the Chilean political system seemed able to contain them.

## The Turning Point

The strains in the system only became unmanageable in mid-1972, when the lid blew off the fragile Chilean economy and let loose the pressures that had been building up for at least a year. As the deficit in government spending, rose, particularly because of its subsidies to the "social area," its foreign reserves dropped nearly to zero, and the growth of industrial output slowed down. Allende replaced Economics Minister Vuskovic with Carlos Matus and appointed Orlando Millas as Finance Minister. The Matus-Millas team sought to "find stability at another level," ordering a drastic currency devaluation, raising prices in the nationalized sector, and permitting limited agricultural price increases. The result was a sharp jump in the cost-of-living Index, which climbed from 27.5 percent at the end of June to 99.8 percent at the end of September. A wage readjustment to compensate for the increase In the cost of living only accelerated the inflation, so that by the end of the year the official consumer price index had reached 163 percent (see Table 1). In September, industrial output began to drop in absolute terms (i.e., not merely in terms of the rate of increase)-a drop that continued every month thereafter until the September 1973 coup." Agricultural production (excluding livestock) also commenced to decline, and mineral production registered precipitous drops, although copper production rose by 1.3 percent for 1972 owing to the fact that a number of new mines came into operation. (On other elements of the worsening economic situation, see Table 2.)

Chile's economic problems were paralleled in the political arena: Several additional ministers were impeched, including the Minister of Interior, who was charged with abetting the illegal importation of arms from Cuba in March. (The Allende govern. ment claimed that suspect shipments from Cuba--"bultos Cubanos"-were "works of art," but after the September 1973 coup, the government White published an inventory of over 2,000 pounds of arms sent frorn Cuba in 13 crates which customs

had been forbidden to Inspect.") The judiciary joined in the conflict, protesting the failure of the Ministry of Justice to carry out court orders, while progovernment demonstrators denounced the viejos de mierda-"filthy old men"-in the Supreme Court. As it became apparent that there was no real possibility of resolving their differences, the two sides turned to the armed forces as impartial arbiters, and the national holidays in mid-September 1972 were marked by rival efforts of the Congress and the President to ingratiate themselves with the military.

The political Involvement of the military was accelerated by the next step in the Chilean tragedy-the October 1972 strike. Respectively termed the "employers' lockout" and "the national strike" by pro- and anti-Allende forces, it began far from Santiago, in the remote southern province of Assen, with a strike by small truckers. (Referred to by the government press as the "truck-owners." the membership of the truckers' gremio-guild-was almost entirely composed of owners of one or two trucks who feared an announced plan to establish a state trucking agency which would have had priority access to new trucks and spare parts). The strike quickly spread across the nation, as the truckers were joined by bus and taxi drivers, shopkeepers, doctors, nurses, dentists, airline pilots, engineers and part of the peasantry. The Christian Democrats and the rightist parties supported the strikers, and the work stoppage dragged on for over a month resulting in an estimated loss of $150-200 million In production. Agriculture was particularly hard hit because the strike took place in the midst of the planting season; indeed, there is no doubt that part, though not all, of the 25-percent drop in the 1973 harvest was the consequence of the strike. Industry was not as adversely affected, since workers attempted to keep factories going despite management's efforts to cease production-and the October strike saw the emergency of "Industrial Belts" (Cordones) and "Communal Commands," which seemed to embody the type of spontaneous "popular power" that leftist theorists had spoken of as the basis of a genuine revolutionary class consciousness to replace the materialistic "economism" that had characterized Chilean workers until this time."

When the workers seized closed factories, the plants were usually "intervened" by the government, so that an Important result of the October strike was a considerable expansion of the government-controlled sector of industry and trade.

The most important outcome of the strike, however, was the direct involvement of the military in the Allende cabinet. A condition of the settlement of the strike was that the military take over key cabinet posts. This resulted most notably in the assignment of the Ministry of the Interior to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General Carlcs Prats, so as to assure that the congressional elections scheduled for March 1973 would be carried on freely and impartially.

The involvement of the military and the preparations for the March elections brought about a lull in the escalation of political conflict in Chile. Inevi-

tably, however, it also produced political divisions within the military itself, which had hitherto been relatively aloof from the process of polarization. It was soon apparent, for instance, that General Prats was willing to give the government the benefit of the doubt in nearly every instance that its decisions or actions were challenged. Conversely, the Navy was noticeably less enthusiastic, and in January Admiral Ismael Huerta resigned from the cabinet over plans for the initiation of what he took to be a food-rationing system. It is now also known that the first plans for a possible coup were made by intermediate-level officers at the end of 1972."

Food distribution became a critical issue as the black market continued to expand, with much of Chile's agricultural production going into illegal channels because of the government's refusal to increase the official prices paid for agricultural produce. The result was, in effect, two separate price systems—a subsidized, state-owned distribution system oriented primarily toward the low-income groups and a flourishing black market aimed at middle- and upper-income groups. The expansion of the powers of government-appointed Supply and Distribution Committees (JAPS) to deal with the black-market problem led the opposition to charge political manipulation of food distribution; nonetheless, the government seemed powerless to combat black-market operations.

# The March 1973 Elections

The congressional elections in March did not resolve anything. Chile's right-wing parties had hoped that food shortages and economic difficulties would produce a two-thirds majority against the government, which might in turn permit the impeachment of the President, but the results, while showing an anti-government majority of 56 percent, gave the Allende regime 44 percent—a larger vote than most observers had predicted. The opposition pointed out that the vote of the pro-government forces had declined from the 50 percent they had registered in the 1971 municipal elections, while the government compared its 44 percent with the 35 percent that Allende had received in 1970. In fact, the only proper basis for comparison was the

1969 congressional elections. On that basis, the Inftist parties had suffered a slight loss in votes but I had achieved a slight gain in seats. Certain oppositionists later argued that the Left would have suffered much greater losses had it not been for a government-assisted electoral fraud involving some 200.000-300,000 votes, but the statistics presented in support of the argument are unconvincing."

While the government's interpretation of the elections as proot that it was expanding its popular support was not accurate, the election results indicated "at at least it had not lost popularity as rapidly as revious governments faced with similar economic reverses. Despite a wage readjustment in October, frat wages had dectired 7 percent in 1972, and rag inflation continued to consume the wage increase. nearly 1973. However, the combination of discriminatory distribution of government-produced goods and appeals to class consciousness seemed to have stemmed the erosion of support, at least amorg the masses of the poor.

Unfortunately for the government's longer-range interests, the deliberate accentuation of class consciousness had an opposite effect on the middle class, driving middle-class areas to organize themselves into "Neighborhood Committees" to defend themselves. It also, for the first time, led many to arrn themselves for a possible confrontation, which seemed more likely now that the safety valve of an impending election was no longer present. A government proposal to limit full wage readjustments to those making less than three times the minimum wage did nothing to reassure the hostile middle-income groups.

Before the elections, it had been rumored that there might be another attempt in March at an accommodation between the regime and the opposition forces, possibly under the auspices of the military. Any possible accord of this type was quickly prevented by the publication, two days after the elections, of a government decree calling for the initiation in June of a single national unified school system, which would follow a common curriculum including compulsory courses in socialism and work

periods in factories. The ensuing uproar involved the Catholic Church for the first time in formal opposition to the government and mobilized thousands of secondary school students in violent demonstrations in downtown Santiago. Stories of fierce arguments over the school proposals among the top military officers (the military had left the cabinet after the elections) filtered into the national press, and a military delegation held a formal meeting with the Education Ministry to express their opposition. The controversy subsided only when the government announced that the proposal had been postponed, pending further discussion.

Within the government, the debate continued on whether to "consolidate in order to advance" (the Communist position) or to "advance without compromise" (the Socialist stance). One indication of how the debate was resolved was the decision by the government to use a constitutionally-authorized "decree of insistence" allowing the cabinet to override the rulings of the Controller General of Chile, Hector Humares, who had disallowed the requisitioning of some of the factories taken over during the October 1972 strike. Conflicts also continued with the judiciary over the executive's refusal to obey court orders to return seized properties. On May 26, the Supreme Court sent a public letter to the President denouncing

... the illegal attitude of the administration... [Its] open and continual rebellion against judicial orders... which signifies a crisis of the rule of law [and] the imminent breakdown of the juridical structure of the country."

The stalemate between the executive and the Congress over the constitutional amendment on the "Three Areas of Property" was compounded when the Constitutional Tribunal refused to take jurisdiction over the disputed question of whether, in the absence of a plebiscite, the Congress could override the President's item vetoes by a majority or by a two-thirds vote." A second constitutional conflict along the same lines developed when the opposition majority in Congress voted in favor of an amendment to give farms under 40 hectares (about 100 acres) in size an absolute guarantee against expropriation

[^18]
[^19]

and to compel the distribution of land in the "reformed" sector to the peasantry after a transitional period of two years. (The government had once again used a loophole in the 1967 law to postpone indefinitely the distribution of expropriated land by individual title.)

In May the official price Index jumped 20 percent, indicating that the inflation was moving into a new hyperinflationary stage. The one effort that the government had made to hold the line--its refusal to grant a full cost-of-living wage increase to the El Teniente copper miners on the grounds that under their contract they had already received partial cost-of-living increases--led to a bruising two-and-a-half month strike, which included a miners' march on Santiago, mass rallies, and simultaneous one-day general strikes for and against the government in mid-June. By that time, Allende was once more ready to resort to military involvement in the cabinet to restore social peace.

## Last Stage-Decline and Fall

On June 29, the last act of the Chilean tragedy began with an abortive revolt by the Second Armored Regiment in Santiago. Apparently, several army units had been in contact with Patria y Libertad, a right-wing political organization, and had planned to seize President Allende at his residence and to occupy the presidential palace. The revolt was canceled one day before it was to occur, but when one of the officers of the Second Armored Regiment was arrested and held in the Defense Ministry, the Regiment decided to free him and in the process to seize the presidential palace as originally planned. General Prats, the Army Commander, used the other military units in Santiago to put down the revolt in a few hours--most of which were spent in negotiation rather than shooting--but not before President Allende had gone on the air to urge "the people" to take over all industries and enterprises as a response to the uprising of "a small group of rebellious military men." The Central Labor Federation also urged the workers to occupy the factories, and in one day the number of companies taken over by the government rose from 282 to 526. The "Industrial Belts" that had sprung up at the time of the October strike now achieved new importance. The spread of "people's power (poder popular) had been seen by Allende as a deterrent to a possible future coup, but it created many additional problems for the

government. Production declined sharply after the Lakeovers, the opposition got fresh fuel for its claim that the expansion of state control of industry was teing carried out through extralegal channels, and "yter popular" as expressed in the worker occu-pations—appeared to some extent to pose a possibit threat of an alternative to the power of the central government.

After the June 29 revolt, Allende made new efforts to secure military involvement in the government, but his negotiations with the armed forces were "unsuccessful." Instead, they embarked on a policy of vigorous enforcernment of the Arms Control Law, a measure which had been adopted in October 1972 but only sporadically enforced thereafter. This law authorized any, military or police commanders to carry out arms searches if there was "a presumption I the clandestine existence of illegal firearms."

The right wing Patria y Libertad organization had fem announced publicly that it was going under-

ground in an attempt to overthrow the government by force, and military intelligence was also aware of the initiation of arms training by all the govern. ment parties, even the centrist Radicals." In the course of their crackdown, the military found arms caches in factories in Santiago and Concepción, and the king of a worker in one such arms raid pro-voked protects from the leftist parties.

At this point, the Chilean Communist Party and the Cattolic Church both concluded independently that the only solution to the Impasse in Chite was one more atternpt at an agreement between the Allende government parties and the Christian Demo-crats. The Cornmunists initiated a campaign against civil war almost simultaneously with a statement by the Chilean hierarchy calling for a renewal of dia-logue. Probably in response to these pressures on both sides, two lengthy discussions took place on July 31 between UP and PDC representatives. Both Allende and the Christian Democrats agreed on the necessity of enforcement of the Arms Control Law. but disagreement continued on the constitutional reforms. Allende offered to sign the arnendment on the "Three Areas of Property" in return for a con-stitutional amendment specifying that the Congress could caly override presidential vetoes of constitu-tional amendments by a two-thirds vote. He also proposed the establishment of joint committees to work out further agreements. However, the Christian Democrats denounced these proposals as "dilatory" and broke off the negotiations.

A few days before the dialogue was Initiated, the truckers began another strike, which was to last from July 26 until the coup on September 11. As in October, the truckers were joined by the other gremios. Coming at a time when the 12-month inflation rate, fueled by massive goverriment budget deficits and subsidies to the nationalized Industries and agriculture, had reached 323 percent—and in a situation where inventories had not yet been built up from the October strike—the truckers' action created much more serious problems for the govern-ment than the earlier strike.

On August 9 Allende swore in what he called a "national security cabinet," with General Prats as Defense Minister, Air Force Commander César Ruiz as Minister of Transport (the ministry which would deal with the striking truckers), and the heads of the Navy and of the National Police in other cabinet posts.

Almost coincident with the entrance of the military into the cabinet, the naval establishment became involved in a serious conflict with the left wing of the Allende coalition. On August 7, the naval Intelligence arm announced the discovery of a plot to carry out an enlisted men's revolt on August 11 in Valparaíso and Concepción. The announcement accused PS Secretary General Carlos Altamirano, MAPU leader Oscar Garreton, and Miguel Enriques. head of the MIR, of being the "intellectual authors" of the revolt and demanded the lifting of the congressional immunity of the first two, who sat respectively in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Two days before the September coup, Altamirano admitted that he had encouraged navymen to resist their coup-minded (goipista) officers."

This attempt to subvert the hierarchy of a service command from below was combined with maneuvers by Allende to replace officers unsympathetic to him. When General Ruiz resigned his cabinet post on August 17 in protest against his lack of sufficient power to settle the string, Allende compelled him to add that his departure from the cabinet "implicitly" carried with it his retirement as Air Force Commander. This was correctly seen as an Allende tactic to remove an officer opposed to him, and it met serious resistance from within the Air Force, provoking a series of actions which ultimately led directly to the September 1.1 coup.

On August 20, top Air Force officers met to decide whether to resist Allende's action. By evening. Ruiz had persuaded them to accept it on the condition that Allende appoint the second-ranking officer, General Gustavo Leigh, as Air Force Commander and name another Air Force general to the cabinet (so that Allende could not repeat the same maneuver with Leigh). The next night the wives of high-ranking military officers, including those of six generals.. gathered in front of General Prats' house to present a letter asking for his resignation. When the demonstration was broken up by police tear gas, it provoked such dissension in the armed forces that on the following day General Prats decided to resign both as Defense Minister and Army Commander. He was joined by two other generals who, with Prats, had led the military forces that had quelled the tank-regiment revolt in June.

The resignation of what appeared to be the last defenders of Allende in the army now meant that all three services were opposed to the President. It coincided with the adoption on the same day of a "sense of the house" (acuerdo) resolution by the Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and the military ministers, drawing their attention to "the serious breakdown of the constitutional and legal order." The resolution criticized the Allende government for repeatedly bypassing the legislature through the use of legal loopholes and for refusing to promulgate the constitutional reforms vc'ed by the Congress. It accused Allende of ignoring judicial orders, encouraging illegal seizure of property, persecuting opposition labor groups, and supporting illegal paramilitary organizations. In conclusion, it stated that the listed actions constituted a "serious breakdown of the constitutional and legat order of the Republic" and urged the military ministers to "put an end to the de facto situations listed above which violate the Constitution and the law" or be

guilty of "compromising the national and professional character of the armed forces."

In its original form, the resolution had declared the Allende government to be illegitimate, but the acuerdo had later been softened in order to secure the support of the Christian Democrats. Yet its effect was still to give a congressional green light to the military, and Allende immediately so interpreted it. He replied to the motion by accusing the Congress of "promoting a coup d'état by asking the military forces to make governmental judgments independently of the authority and direction of the President"; he also pointed out that according to the Constitution the only way that the Congress could decide on the legality of the President's conduct of his office was through. Impeachment by a two-thirds vote."

The congressional vote was echoed by several professional associations. The Medical Association called on their "colleague" Allende to resign—a request that was echoed by the Federation of Professionals (CUPROCH)—and resignation petitions were circulated in Santiago. The Lawyers' Association issued a declaration which— "without attributing a malevolent intention" to the President—asserted an "incompatibility between the institutional framework within which he is supposed to exercise his office. and the actions which he feels obliged to carry out in his program." Arguing that Allende "would appear to be incapacitated (impedido) in the exercise of his functions as he understands them," the statement suggested that he could be removed from office under Article 43 of the Constitution, which authorizes the Congress to declare presidential incapacity."

## The Coup

Exactly when the decision to carry out the coup was made is not yet certain, but it evidently was reached in the days following Prats' resignation. The armed forces had contingency plans for the control of vital points throughout the country in case of any emergency, and it only required a signal to put them into opération. Hence the actual seizure of control required little preparation.

After the resignations of the third week of August, Allende restructured his cabirict without the top military commanders but still retained representatives of the armed forces in ministerial posts. Over the opposition of other PS leaders, he appointed as Minister of the Interior his socialist colleague Carlos Briones, who was known to be interested in another attempt at accommodation with the Christian Democrats. The president aiso canceled a projected trip to the Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Algiers. The government and the opposition again staged rival demonstrations in connection with the third anniversary of the 1970 presidential elections..

On the weekend before the coup, the Christian Democrats called all provincial party leaders to a meeting at which a proposal was adopted for the simultaneous resignation of the Congress and the President and for new elections to resolve the con-

flict between the executive and legislative branches. During the same weekend, Allende met with the leaders of his Popular Unity coalition and called for the holding of a plebiscite on his conduct of office. Although this step was reportedly opposed by the Socialists, Briones subsequently asserted that Allende planned to announce the plebiscite in a radio address at noon on the day of the coup.

Meantime, after a stormy session with Allende on September 7, the military commanders proceeded on Sunday, September 9, to draft the text of the pronunciamiento issued on September 11. They did not secure the agreement of the National Police until early on the morning of the coup itself, and only after the fourth-ranking officer in seniority had taken over the position of police commander.

On September 10, Navy units set sail from Valparaíso for previously scheduled maneuvers, but that evening they returned to port and by early morning of the 11th had seized control of that city. Concepción, the third-ranking city in Chile and a known center of leftist activism, was taken over without a hitch. Santiago required a few hours longer.

To justify their action, the military commanders broadcast a communiqué to the nation. While admitting that the Allende government had initially come to power by legal means, they announced that it had "fallen into flagrant illegitimacy" by violating fundamental rights, by "artificially fomenting the class struggle," by refusing to implement the decisions of the Congress, the judiciary and the Controller-General, by causing a critical decline in agricultural, commercial and industrial activity in the country, and by bringing about a state of inflation and anarchy which "threaten the internal and external security of the country." The coup leaders concluded:

These reasons are sufficient in the light of classical doctrine . . . to justify our intervention to depose a government which is illegitimate, immoral, and unrepresentative of the overwhelming sentiment of the nation."

At 9:30 a.m., when it was apparent that no one but the GAP, his personal bodyguard, was ready to defend him, Allende broadcast his last message to

the Chilean people over the single pi.. Allende rádio station that had not yet been shut down by the military. He began:

This is surely the last time that I will be able to speak to you..... My words are not spoken in bitterness but disappointment. In the face of these events / can only say to the workers, "I am not going to resign." At this historic juncture I will pay with my life for the loyalty of the people.

Blaming "foreign capital, Imperialism, and reaction" for persuading the armed forces to break with their tradition, he said:

History will judge them.... My voice will no longer come to you, but it does not matter. You will con- tinue to hear it; it will always be among you. At the least, you will remember me as an honorable man who was loyal to the revolution."

At 11:00 a.m., the coup leaders permitted those who wished to do so to leave the building, and— except for his personal secretary—all the women, Including Allende's pregnant daughter, left. The military also offered the President and his family safe conduct out of the country if he would sur- render. Allende rejected the offer. The Air Force then sent in Hawker Hunter bombers, which re- peatedly hit the palace with rockets and set fire to large portions of it. Finally, shortly after 1:30 p.m., Allende decided to discontinue the resistance, and the members who had been with him left the build- ing in single file, led by the secretary carrying a white flag. Allende stayed behind and, sitting on a sofa in a reception room on the second floor, put two bullets into his head. The automatic rifle that he used was a gift from Fidel Castro."

Conclusions

Since the coup, comments in the world press representing widely divergent political postures have cited the Chilean case as proof that the hope of achieving Marxist socialism through democratic means is a vain one. Yet most people have failed to note two fundamental errors of the Allende policy. mither of which was essentially related to the : attempt to establish democratic socialism:

(1) As noted at the outset, the very quotation from 'Engels that Allende cited at the beginning of his

61

administration to justify , course states as a pre- requisite "the support of the majority of the people." Allende acted as if he had that support; but even at the highest point of his popularity in the April 1971 elections, he never achieved it. Moreover, his policy of deliberate class polarization, aimed at ex- panding his electoral base, was more successful in pitting professional and middle-class groups against him than in widening his support among workers, peasants and low-income groups.

2) Marxist economists and policymakers have always placed primary emphasis on investment and the expansion of the productive capacity of the economy. By contrast, the Allende policymakers emphasized increases In consumption and cornbined this with a headlong rush to take over industry and agriculture—a course far removed from the "two steps forward, one step back" of Lenin. The conse. quences of these policies after their deceptive initial success were massive government deficits, runaway inflation, and a near-breakdown of the economy. (The argument that Allende's economic problems were the result of a shortage of foreign credit does not really hold water, since they were caused by policies initiated before the foreign squeeze 'and since, in any event, Allende's regime managed to secure enough foreign credits from Latin American, European, Soviet and Chinese sources to increase the Chilean foreign debt from $2.6 billion to $3.4 billion in less than three years. Much of the new indebtedness was to Western Europe and other Latin American countries. Surprisingly, Chile's debt to the USSR, China and Eastern Europe increased only from $9 million to $40 million between 1970 and 1973.")

Specic aspects of the Chilean system also made the Allende experiment a particularly difficult one. He was able to come to power in the first place because of Chile's deeply-rooted commitment to the democratic system and because the Marxist parties were able to mobilize a part of the proletariat and the peasantry, and he had at his disposal many instruments for state control of the economy which had been developed by previous administrations since the 1930's. However, he was required to operate within an institutional system which included frequent and staggered elections, proportional representation, and a multiparty system which made majority rule very difficult and often gave veto powers to the extremes of Right and Left. The economy had been characterized for nearly a century by a chronic tendency to inflation, and successive governments had consistently ignored agriculture in the Interest of securing urban electoral support. The most important systemic constraint of all, of course, was the existence of a professionalized and institutionally-loyal military which was unresponsive to the ideological blandishments of the Left."

The immediate causes of the military intervention are apparent from the preceding account. In the last part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean politics by both sides and became as polarized as the rest of Chilean society-with the overwhelming majority joining the opposition to Allende. The conflict over education in March-April 1973 heightened that polarization just at the time the military were attempting to extricate themselves from political Involvement. Then the expansion of arms searches in mid-1973 revealed the extent to which Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing military hierarchy by a combination of leftist activity among enlisted men and presidential maneuvering with promotions and retirements provided the classis scenario for a coup d'état.

> The Socialists always believed that they could convert the military to their outlook. This is strikingly revealed in Socialist Party documents published in the Libro Bianco, pp. 124-30.

One can also relate Allenge's difficulties to the inherent contradictions in the Marxist theory to which he appealed.. At the same time that he proclaimed his faith in a democratic, pluralist and libertarian transition to socialism, many of his Marxist-supporters spoke and acted on the basis of a belief in the inevitability of armed confrontation. With his knowledge, they armed themselves and-what was worse-talked incessantly about revolution. The repeated statements of Regis Debray and others that the observance of the rules of "bourgeois" legality was only a tactic until the balance of forces had improved was hardly likely to persuade doubters of the sincerity of Allende's commitment to democracy. When the importation and distribution of arms was combined with efforts to reorganize education along ideological lines, to sübvert military discipline, and to rearrange the hierarchy of command, It is not altogether surprising that the military finally took action.

A positive evaluation of the Allende years would certainly credit him with a sincere effort to ralse the living standards of low-income groups and to involve them actively In the determination of their own future. It would likewise stress the continued existence of freedom of expression for all points of view in Chile right up to the coup. A more negative assessment would ask whether the low-income groups in Chile genuinely benefited from an economic policy which after the first half of 1972 produced hyperinflation, a continuous drop in agricultural and industrial production, and a reduction in the real value of wages and salaries. Even more critically, one could inquire who has suffered the most in economic and in human terms as a result of the breakdown of the Chilean system-the Marxist politicians, many of whom were able to escape or go into exile, or the workers, peasants and slum-dweilers they claimed to represent, who are now paying the price of the Allende regime's mistakes in the form of the hardships imposed by sharply reduced consumption and the strictures of dracon-ian military rule.

# Kremlin's Hand in Allende's Chile
by JAMES THEBERGE

Why did Salvador Allende's revolutionary gov- ernment end in a bloodbath despite Soviet sup- port and the plaudits of the world's lol:-wing extremists, who saw in Chile a new path for Socialism's merch to power?

James Theberge, who is Director of the Latin American Department of the Georgetown Uni- versity Center for Strategic ard International Studies, shows how Moscow, the "big brother". though eager to exploit this opening in Latin America to the full, disagreed with Allende's headlong methods, and while warning him of the growing economic chaos denied him enough financial eid.

In 1935, Moscow dispatched Eudocio Ravines, a brilliant Peruvian Communist organiser, to Chile to implement the "united from:" and "anti-fascist popular front" strategy that had replaced, the ultra-loft strategy of the Comincern. Since that time the Chilean Coinmunist pary generally has followed a strategy of broad alliance and limited aims, although the Cuban revctation led to a radicalisation of party stra

The Chilean Communist party, ome of the most loyal pro-Soviet partias in Latin America, gave unqualified support to the Soviet bloc invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1963. Vinile its fortunes have shifted through the years as a result of dormestic and international developments, it un- stintingly supported the rivists and turns of Soviat foreign policy and repeated accow's themes of anti-imperialism and class warfare.

The party, at least prior to the military Inter- vertion of September, 1973. was the best organ- Ised and strongest in Latin America. Estwaen 1956 and 1969 it formad an uneesy alliance for electoral purposes with the Socialist Party, its more militant Marxist rival on the Left. But in 1969 the Communists deciced at a much more broadly based ailiance of left-wing forces was necessary for the transformation of the country Into a socialist state and they played a key rola in the founding of the Popular Unity Front (a coalition of six leftist partins) at the end of that year. After the 1970 electoral victory of the Popular Unity Fron: under Salvador Allende the Communists became the singla most influential force within the coalition. It was a for cattar organised and disciplined participant than its closest rival, the more ideologically unstable and militant Socialist Party.

The ultimate aim of the party did nct waver throughout the Allanda period. The Commur.ists hoped to be able to take advantage of the weak: ness of the democratic institutions to install a "dictatorship of the proletariat" under their direction. Their Secretary-General, Eduardo Labarca, made this clear in ris Corvalin 27 Hores (Santiago, Editorial Cantu, 1972), in which he declared: "Form for from capital-

Isın to Socialism necessarily requires that the proletariat be converted into the leading class, into the determining social force"..

The Communist strategy, shared by Salvador Allcride and the "moderate" wing of the Socialist Party, was 10 "certhrow" the bourgeois state and constitutina, using the legal device of the plebiscito, an interview with. Régis Debray in 1971 Allende said: "As for the bourgeois state at the present morient, we are seeking to overcome il. To ovenbrow ill" (Regis Debray, The Chilean Revolution, Conversations with Allende, New York, Randern House, 1971 ρ.82).

Mass mobilisation, infiltration of Chilean in- stitutions and tactical alliances with the opposi tion were in be employed to generate sufficient popular support. Congress was to to replaced by a "popular assembly" and the existing legal system by "populer tribunals." President Allende's piedge to uphold the "Statute of Guaranices" (designed to commit his government to preserve Chile's democratic freedoms and institutions in exchange for Congressional support) was simply a "tactical necessity" to gain power, as he ex- plained later.

The Chilean Conimunists and their allies. in Moscow were uneasy about the ideological im- plications of the via Chilena as advocated by Salvador Allende (Debray, p.119). The Com- munis: party refused to endorse the via, Chilena as a uniquely Chilean path to socialism, which in:plied that it might not necessarily assume the leading role after complete power was gained by the Popular Unity coalition. The Chilean party supported Moscow's doctrine of the via pecifica, which accepted frce eluctions and popular plural. ism as a short-term tactical device under Chilean conditions but aimed in the long run at installing a Soviet-style Communist dictatorship. The via pacifica was not as "pacific" as the slogan in. plied: it embraced all forms of class conflict and violence short of armed insurrection and civil war in the process of establishing the "dictator- ship of the proletariat."

Misleading Image

The via Chilena proclaimed by Allende scon aiter his election was widely misunderstood in the West. The image that was officially propa- gated was that of a uniquely Chilean path to a new type of Marxist humanist socialism, where Basic liberties, economic pluralism and frea elections were respected by all. Western liberals were led to believe that the Allende government was constructing a new Western-European type of democratic socialism in Chite. This image clashed with the reality of Salvador Allende's revolutionary ambition to use Ching's pluralist democracy to destroy it. He seemed to have abandoned the via Chilena formula during the last year c' his government. Not only cid he rarely

employ it in his speeches but the importance of preserving "democracy, pluralism and liberty" was conspicuously absent.

The government's policy was very much to Moscow's liking: secure of US investments, espousal of the doctrine of "idouteqicai plural-Ism" (relations win all status regardless af Ideology and internal political character), closer relations with the socialist camp, and the foster-Ing of en "anti-imperialist (anti-US) front in Latin America.

Under the Allende regime, foreign policy was reoriented, and the previously close ties with tha United States were replaced by strong political, economic and scientific ties with the "socialist countries," above all with Cuba and the USSR. The first trip of tha Fereign Minister, Clodomiro Almeyda, outside of Latin America was to the USSR and Enstern Europe, in May-June, 1971. President Allende visited Moscow In December, 1972. Strong idealegical and personal ties linked the Chilean Communist party leaders with the Soviet party leadership and Salvador Allende with Fidul Castro.

President Allende's description of the USSR as Chila's "hig brother" (hermano mayor) was no mere figure of speech but reflected the expect-ation of his government that the USSR would be-come the most important socialist ally of the revolution and the main economic bulwark of the regimo. Moscow did, in fact. become the most Important source of socialist camp uconomic aid and credits to the Popular Unity government, totalling $620.0 million ($156.5 million in short term bank credit and $463.5 million in project ald and supplier credits) in the 1971-73 period.

The USSR authorised $260.5 million in credits ($98.5 million in short-term credit and $162.0 million in economic aid) to the Allende regime, most of which was nevar utilised. This was far from the massive he'p Allende needed. But Mos-cow was under no illusion that its economic co-operation would decisively influence the Immediate prospects for radical social and economic transformation, although it no doubt helped reduce Chile's dependence on the United States.

Soviet influence expanded rapidly as a result of the Chilean Communist party's loyalty to the USSR and the expansion of Soviet-Chilean economic, technical, scientific, cultural, and fisheries cooperation made possible by the victory of the Communist Socialist regime. But Moscow became increasingly alarmed at the deterioration of the economic situation, the violent clashes of the ultra-lat: and the ultra-right, and the growing organisation of opposition forces. particularly after the Papuler Unity government failed in the March, 1973. elections to obtain the majority electoral support required to transform the political and economic structure by peachful, constitutional means.

Nevertheless, Moscow was not willing to pro-vide the massive short-trim commodity assist-anco (such as foodstuffs) or untied converteפול currency credits which the regime needed to finance the import of food, spare parts, and מתולפנותry 10o alleviate local shortages. Moscow's $90.5 million in short-terim bank credits was no doub: helpful but paled into insignificance before the need to finance Chulg's import requirements, which, for food alone, were running at the rate of about $700 million a year when the Allende regime collapsed. The Soviet leadership told Chilean Communist and Popular Unity officials that the main effort to improve the economic situ-ation would have to be made by the Allerde go ernment. Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Popular Unity government must reverse the calamitous decline in production and product-ivity to have a chance of winning over a majority of the Chileans to the cause of socialism.

Refusing to give Aliendo the hard currency credits he needed to improve his worsening chances for survival, Moscow contented itself with organising solidarity meetings at home and abroad in the hope that these demonstrations would "reach the ears of the Chilean people"(Moscow Radio. 13 August 1973). Allende's loyal ally and "big brother" was willing to sell Soviet machinery and equipment to him-that is, ex-pand Soviet exports financed by long-term credits: -but denied him the short-term hard currency credits he desperately needed.

A combination of circunstances - Moscow's costly entanglement in Cuba, economic difficulties at home, shortages of grain and foreign exchange -led the USSR to eschew messive short-teren aid to Chile and to counsel a policy of self-help to the Allende regime a theme repeated fre-quently by the Chitean Communist party leader-ship when referring to Soviet assistance. In the final analysis Moscow watched idly while the via pacifica was destroyed by the disastrous economic policies, the circumvention of the laws, and the tacit encouragement of the ultra-left by President Allende and the Popular Unity govern ment.

Moscow pursued a dual strategy in Chile. At the level of state-to-state relations it acted cautiously, adopted a non-interventionist posture, and encouraged anti-Americanism and independ-ence from the United States. Since it realised that the internal balance of forces did not favour the armed struggle, the Popular Urity leadership asured to maintain internal unity, reject the "provocativa and adventurous" overtures of the ultra-left, avoid actions that migh: provate a civil war or military intervention, adapt a more rational economic policy, and consolidate the initial gains of the revolution.

At the same time, Moscow did nothing to re-strain direct Cuban involvement in the Chilean revolution. Protected by a friendly. Marxist-daminated government and its Marxist President, Cuba transported large quantities of Semet and Crechoslovak-supplied weapons to the radical left in Chile on the Cutan airline and merchant ships.

It also established a guerril'a training base and coordinating centre in Chile. The large intõljig. ency tearn in tha Cohan Embassy in Santiago maintained liaison with the liberation movement in Argentina, Bolivia, ant Uruguay. Cubi's Soviet controlied intelligence service. Dirección General do Inteligencia (DGI), aina had close ties with the Chilean ultra-leftist and other revolutionary exile groups, providing them with training, arras and furids for the armed struggle in Chile and other Latin Amarican countries.

## Revolutionaries Trained

Soviet army personnel were directly involved in the training of worker-revolutionaries for urban guerrilla warfare. This occurred during 1972-73 at El Belloto, near Valparaiso, where the USSR had installed a factory for the manufacture of prefabricated housing. The firm (KPD) employed sixteen Pussians, four of whom were engineers and technicians; the remaining twelve, wore Soviet army officers. After working hours, these twelve officers instructed a hard-core of specially. selected worker-revolutionaries in the use of arms, street fighting. and urban guerrilla tactics. The Russian-built factory was kept under constant surveillarice by Chile's naval intelligenco. On the morning of 11 September 1973, naval intelligence arrested the Russians and three days later ex-polled them from the country".

This clandestine involvement in training guerrillas in Chile was an exception to Moscow's official line of giving full support to the legal and peaceful path to socialism. But the Soviet leader-ship operates on the principle that sincu every eventuality cannot be foreseen it is batter to take advance measures which might "contradict" the official lice than to be sorry later. In Chile there clearly were some advantages in having some armed revolutionaries under direct Soviet control: Moscow would be able to retain some measure of Influence over the ultra-left, particularly import-ant in the event that this faction was able to seize power. As it turned out. Pussia's "united front" tactics failed, and the armed struggle was aborted by the Chilean military.

## Sovlet Industrial Espionare

The Soviet Union made every effort to extract the maximum advantage from its technical assist. ance programme. It assigned 45 technicians to the nationalised cooper industry to help raise productivity, all of whom were engaged in in-dustrial espionage. They were far more interested In gaining first-hand knowledge of the advanced US mining equipment and methods of operation than in assisting Chilaan development. Anches Zauschquevich, executiva vice-prasident of the copper corporation, told me in December 1973 that the specialists during their two-year stay contributed nothing to the improvement et mining operations and wera mainly uccupied in gathering specifications of American equipment, obtaining Information on mining techniques and organisa-tion, and collecting data on costs and product-Ivity.

The Soviet Union offered to supply $300 million in military equipinent to Allende in 1971. but the military refused the offer and decided to continue to obtain arms from the United States and othar Western suppliers. The anti-Cornrnunist military wero disturbed by the deepening economic and political violence under the Popular Unity government, and were anxious not to weaken their military ties with the United States and Wastern Europe by turning to the Sovint Union for arms. M.scow had hoped to establish an important procedent for supplying arms to non-Communist countries in Latin America and further weaken Washington's already strained reissions with the Latin American military, Despite the cool. ness of oficial US-Chilean relations, the United States continued to maintain friendly relations with the Chilean military.

The Kremlin was very much aware of the weak. ness of the Aliende regime. Not only was it a minority government (in 1970, 35% and, in 1973, 43% of the electorato supported the Popular Unity coalition) but the armed forces and power-ful national police were strongly anti-Communist. Since the "democratic forces" lacked full political and economic power, Moscow favoured a gradual take-over by the Communists and avoidance of civil war or military confrontation at all costs. Beth the ultra-left and ultra-right opponents of Allende were attacked regularly in the Soviet prass, But the Moverment of the Revo-lutionary Left (MIR), an ultra-left group that pur-sued the armed path and hoped to defeat the opposition forces in a violent confrontation, was singled out for particularly scathing criticism. It was charged with "revolutionary adventprism". contributing to political instability and harming the prospects of survival of the Popular Unity government.

From mid-1972 onwards, Moscow realised that the opposition to the Allende governinent was growing and widespread. It was only the shrewd and dilatory personality of Allendackilled in maintaining a balance between the disruptive forces within his own government-that held to-gether the disintegrating fabric of society. There was Soviet criticism of the irrational economic managament, declining agricultural and industrial production, accelerating inflation, and the worsening balance of paynmen's.

Soviet observers advised a slower take-over of the economy, nationalising the large firms first but leaving the smaller and medium-sized firms alone for the tima being. In the last moriths before the military coup they saw the handwriting on the wall and urged a consolidation of the economic gains already achieved, collaboration with the opposition political parties (especially the Christian Democrats and avoidance of armed conflict.

# Collapse of Socialist 'Model'

The Soviet policy vis-a-vis Chile emphasised cooperation in the political field, the forcing of an arti US front with Chile, Peru and Cuba, and expansion of trade and aid relations while ro fraining from polemics and interfering in Chile's Internal affairs (mainly through its influence over the Chilean Communist Party). The Chilean Communists were given moral and material support for widening the base of support of the regime, but it made no difference to the final outcome. The weakness of the Allenda regime, its fateful Internal contradictions, oficial connivance in the arming and violence of the ultra-left, the Weimar-type inflation and food shortages, the groving political polarisation and violence, and the fate fut alienation of the armed forces were the do-cisive conditions that triggered the coup d'état that led to Aliende's downfall and replacement by a militery junts on 11 September, 1973.

Moscow was deeply disturbed but not especi ally surprised. TASS admitted on 20 September 1973 that the "Chilean experierice was bitter and dramatic," and Fidel Castro declared that he was 'vory upset by events in Chile" (the now military junta had immediately broken oll relations with Havana). Moscow savered diplomatic relations with Santiago and withdrow its ambassador and embassy staff because of alleged persecution of Soviet officials by the Junta. After less than a week in power, Chila's naw mliitary government began to teal the full blast of Sovint displeasure and frustration, expressed in a well-orchestratad and sustained propaganda campaign aimed at Isolating and discrediting the regiono.

The Soviet media accused the junta of "per-socuting left-wingers with unparalleled cruelty" (Moscow Radio, 13 September 1973;. Thera were reports in Pravda on 26 September that "the streets of Santiago were flowing with biccd" and the radio spoke of "tens of thousands of Chilean democre:s" killed.

The overthrow of the Allende government was a bitter but not entirely unexpected setback for Moscow's united front tactics in Latin America, and had adverse repercussions for Marxist parties elsewhere in the West. Cornmunists and Socialists in France and italy who had earlier pointed to Chile as a model of the peaceful trans-ition to socialism moved to disengage themselves from the Allende disaster. Instead of leading to socialism, united front tactics in Chila ushered in a period of unparalleled political violence, encrmous suffering for Chila's workers and middie class, and the worst economic crisis in its history.

Sovint designs for Chile to serve as tho van. guard of the anti-US front in Latin Arnerica ended in a complete fiasco and left a deep impression on the non-Communist political partias and the armed forces in the region. It reminded them of the grave risks of entering into an alliance with totalitarian parties. Despite protestations to the contrary, Marxist governments are driven in-exorably to violate pledges to uphold the con-stitution, to destroy the private sector of the economy, and ultimately to install a totalitarian dictatorship.

Authoritative statements of the Chilean Communist Party's position under the Altence regime can be found in Labarca's Corvalan 27 Mores and Luis Corvalan's Camino da Victoria, (Santiago, 1971).

The university, an urban campus with old and semi-modern buildings scattered throughout the city, is organized alon;: European lines. Eleven separate faculties, like separate colleges. educate lawyers, doctors, agronomists and liberal professionals. Each gives two years of basic college education. Seven years ago, after a violent university purge by Argentina's military government, many parts of the separate curricula were shaped to American models.

When the Peronists returned to power last May. young leftist leaders loyal to Peron were given the university as their share of the new government. It changed almost overnight.

Entrance examinations were abolished and all high school graduates were offered admission. One year later, 85.000 new students had entered and the enrollment had doubled.

"There are so many people now, it seems that even the rats from the basement take exams," said a fourth year philosophy student.

Professors with connections to the military government or fore in companies were dismissed. Fourteen were fired from the faculty of economics alone. The university broke off assistance and exchange agreements with the Ford Foundation. the University of California and Rutgers, and opened new programs with universities in Peru, Algeria and Mexico.

Courses of study were changed. Traditional philosophy courses were replaced, In part, by studies of South American politicians and Peron's doctrine. In an introductory architecture course, a slide show al'ernates views of a new Sheraton hoolete with pictures of the capital's shantytowns and is followed by a discussion of American imperialism in Argentina.

"Last year we had Samuelson, this year we had Lenin," said a second year student of economics. "It's really interesting. We learned how Samuelson's book (An Introduction to Economics by Paul A. Samuelson, an introductory text widely used: in the United States and some foreign countries) used a!! those graphs and curves to prove that imperialism was necessary. Oh, not directly, but subtly, you know."

"We took out Samuelson but we did not replace him with Lenin or Marx," Oscar Sbarra Mitre, the 33-year-old dean of the economies faculty, said during an interview. He explained that there is now no single textbook for the twoyear introductory course, but rather a reading list with a majority of Latin American authors. Marx--as well as John Maynard Keynes--shows up as an individual theorist, but not as the last word.

The shift from studies designed to produce executives for giant companies to a more populist and national outlook. Sharra Mitre said, is better exemplified by the course called "History of the Union Movement and Labor Relations," which replaced a course on personnel management.

It was not educational policy, however, but pure politics that turned the university luto a left-wing redoubt defying the Peronist government. A basic university law, laying down the rules for Buenos Aires and the eight other campuses of the national university system. passedress by a large majority late last year with the support from non-l'eronist parties. The law embodied the basic changes that had begun at Buenos Aires.

Meanwhile, a majority faction in the Peronist youth movement backed by two-urban guerrilla groups, that had fought the military government under Peron's banner, bad made the university here their power base. They proclaimed a government program that smacked heartily of Marxism-Leninism and, in effect, challenged Peron for leadership of his movement.

"Luck, these people are anything but Peronists," Gen. Peron said last February, when he first began trying to separate his movement's youth wing from the leaders born of the guerrilla movement who call themselves Montoneros.

"Before thinking about getting organized, we've got to think how it can bo a true organization and not a sack full of cats who will start showing their claws pretty soon." Peron told leaders of the youth wing. He asked them to reorganize themselves and expel the Marxists. "That's why this purification is necessary," he said.

The purification leron wanted has been thwarted, in part by government reluctance to drive the whole youth wing into open revolt. and in part by students from the University of Buenos Aires. Twice, since April, they have marched into the streets to protest the appointment of new deans and have forced the government to back down.:

A week ago they took over 10 of the 11 faculties in a move to hold onto the temporary university rector, Raul Laguzzi, 12, a professor of pharmacy who is loyal to the Montoncros. And, inside the faculties, it often seems as if one is inside Peron's "sack of cats."

At the medical faculty recently, students who still proclaim loyalty to Peron started playing the Peronist marching song on a loudspeaker system. A faction that stands further to the left put on the Internationale, the Communist hymn, and turned up the volume on their own sound system. The Peronists turned up their volume, and so it went, to ear-shattering levels.

"It isn't bad once you get above the second Moor." a professor of neurobiology said.

Slowly the university crisis seems to be heading for some kind of resolution. A week ago, President Maria Estela Peron named a new minister of education. He is expected to name a rew rector. Student street demonstrations have been quickly and sharply put down by police. The same demonstrations were tolerated by her late husband.

There have been some hints that the government will try to defuse the crisis by unraveling Peronist politics and the quarrel with the Montoneros from university policies.

"We're waiting to see who the new rector will be." said a young professor. "That should clear up something. In the meantine, if you're thinking of building a house in Argentina, get an old architect."

## & the Myth Makers
### Political Realisım & Revolutionary Romance

UTILING AS IT MAY SEEM to say so when the bloodshed of the Chilean coup d'état is still so koonly remembered and the generals who made it are riding unpleasantly high, the fact remains that Salvador Allende died a lucky man. In life he was a failure. Both his policies and his country were shattered long before the end. But in death he achieved success beyond his dreams. Instantly canonised as the Western world's newest left-wing martyr, he became overnight the most potent political cult-figure since his old friend, Che Guevara,

To some extant, of course, the congregation had already been prepared for this posthumous elevation. In Che three years of Allende's administration the "Chilean experiment" and the "Chilean road to socialism" had become favourite topics of discussion among left-wing groups in Europe, where Chile's supposed resemblance to Italy or France had encouraged the belief that Europe might, for once, foliow in Latin America's footsteps instead of the other way about. Many aspiring revolutionaries from Europe and the United States had actually joined their Latin American counterparts in Chile in much the same spirit as their dropped- out contemporaries had hitch-hiked to Nepal hoping for a glimpse of Paradise in action. By the time of the September coup the military junta claimed there were as many as 15,000 foreigners of all kinds in Chile, actively supporting-some- times with violence-the "socialist revolution,"

DAVID HOLDIM has travelled in Chile on several recent assignomerus as Chief Foreign Correspondent for the "Sunday Times." Among his regular contributions to ENCOUNTER are "South African Notebook" (August 1970). "Day Trip to Zarztbar" (September 1972) and "Ethiopia- Forty Years On" (February 1973).

These specially interested groups or individuals obviously provided a ready network for international propaganda in the aftermath of Allende's death. But the shocked and, at times, almost hysterical reaction to the coup went far beyond such committed parties to embrace many of the West's ordinary liberals and social democrats. For them, as much as for the scif- styled revolutionaries, it seemed, a bright light of world-wide hope had been extinguished in Santiago; and from Washington to Rome, via Paris, Boon and London, anguished cries of Foul!" reat the air.

THE OUTCRY IN BRITAIN Was typical-and instantanenne

Revolt Against the Ballot Box" for which the Chilean armed forces could offer no excuse (*The Guardian, 12'9,73*); as a "Disaster in Chile" that would "set back the cause of social- iwn and democracy everywhere" (*New States тол, 14/9/73*); and as "The Death of a Hope" comparable, even, to the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia that ended Alexander Dubock's régime in 1968 (*The Observer, 16/9/73*).

Within 24 hours of the first, bare news of the coup the General-Secretary of the British Labour Party, Mr Ron Hayward, was writing officially to one of Allende's former colleagues to say that it was difficult to express the sense of horror and anger felt by the British Labour movement "as the aspirations of the working people of Chile- shared by so many others around the world are destroyed at the hands of a few arrogant and ignorant officers acting at the behest of those who believe their right to rule is unchallengeablo". (*The Times, 13/9/73*). Mr Len Murray, General- Secretary of the Trades Union Council, expressed his shock and abhorrence with equal speed and vigour. And Mrs Judith Hart, speaking a a member of the Labour Party's National Executive, unleashed a torrent of assertions so passionates as to suggest that her mind had come close to being overthrown with Allende's government. They ranged from the declaration that "the democratic will of the people of Chile" had been defeated by capitalist "collusion" (*The Guardian, 17/9/73*) to "for Socialists of this generation Chile is our Spain" and "This is the most vicious fascism we have seen in generations" (*The Guardian, 19/9/73*).

When the Labour Party Conference met at Blackpool three weeks later these instant re- actions had hardened into established orthodoxy. The former Chilean Ambassador in London was given a standing ovation when he became the first non-delegate to address a Party Conference since two Spanish Republicans were allowed to do so in the 1930s. Resolutions were then carried utterly condemning the military coup and the precipitate action of the British Government in recognising the military junta; demanding the recall of the British Ambassador from Santiago and the withholding from the military régime of all aid, loans, and credits; and calling on the Labour Movement to campaign for the restora- tion of democracy in Chile and to offer financial and other assistance to the Popular Unity (Allende's) morenent (*The Tunes, 5/10/73*).

Ignorance and wishful thinking-always the two
most powerful sources of political romanticism-
which left the facts of life in Allende's Chile
either unknown or imured and the Geld wide
open, therefore, to the creation of instant myth
Hence the composite picture, now accepted
throughout a wide spectrum of Western liberal
and left-wing opinion, of Allende as a genuine
social democrat of impeccable constitutional
propriety who met his end at the hands of a
fascist conspiracy on behalf of a minority "ruling
class" aided and abetted by the United States
of America.

To replace this romantic vision with something
approaching reality may already be impossible,
for myths undoubtedly possess a life of their own
Immune to rational challenge. To attempt to to
so also may entail some risk of abuse, for it
seems to be a common assumption nowadays
that anyone who seeks a rational explanation of
a military coup d'etat (unless it happens to
represent a left-wing interest) is necessarily a
fascist beast.

I SHOULD MAKE IT PLAIN, therefore, that I am
concerned here with Allende's Chile and not with
what has taken its place. I hold no brief for
military juntas, nor for the stummary executions,
mass imprisonments, censorship or whatever that
the Chilean junta may have inspired or tolerated
during its early months of power. Indeed, because
I happen to know and like Chile as a country and
count a number of Chileans among my friends I
feel some personal sadness at the country's
present plight. But I feel no surprise nor, I am
afraid, much morel shock. Military men will be

Chile was left in such a mess by Allends that

have been achieved without violence by a
democratic government that was ready to work
pragmatically within the constitution and with a
proper respect for what the economic and
political fabric of Chile would stand.

But that is not the point any more. What I am
concerned about is how the country came to its
present pass. And without wishing to speak ill of
the dead, it seems to me necessary to say outright
for the sake of the living that the Chilean coup
was largely Aliende's own fault and that the myths
with which it has been surrounded on the Left are
not merely a falsification of Chilean history but
a potential danger to the future of liberal and
social democratic politics in the Western world
as well. Indeed, what is most disturbing to me
about the fashionable Western reactions to events
in Chile is their revelation of the degree to which
revolutionary romanticism has combined with
left-wing cynicism in recent years to corrupt our
own politics. It is certainly "co accident" that,
for example, the British Labour Party which so
uncritically adopts Allende's cause is also the
party which has permitted its self-avowed
Marxists and utopian socialista to zain factional
positions of unprecedented power.

I will leave others to pursue that theme,
however. All I want to do is to try to set some of.
the Chilean record straight-or at any rate;
straighter-by looking in some detail at three of
the main myths that now surround the end of
Allende and his famous experiment..

## 1. The American Intervention Myth

THIS FOUND its most virulent expression in
the equation of Allende's downfall with that
of Dubcek. Yet in the absence of any American
armed assault to compare with the Soviet invasion
of Czechoslovakia-let alone the fact that
whereas Dubcek's Parliament supported him
against the Russians, a majority of Allende's
Congress invited him to resign-there were only :
stereotype suppositions to sustain in

In general, the American intervention myth
seemed to derive from that.characteristic Latin
American and left-wing scapegoat complex which
insists that the Yunquis are responsible for every-
thing (except, of course, anything good). Gar-
nished with historical fact (Guatemala, the Bay of
Pigs, etc.) this is frequently transmuted in Latin
American affairs into a plausible anti-American
smear; and the state of Washington politics in
1973 was, of course, guaranteed to give such a
smear extra credence this time. The New States
man offered a fine example. "The likelihood is
that the trail will lead back to the Pentagon", it
assured its readers, "if a proper investigation can
ever be mounted. But in default of this it does
seem possible to say that Nixonism and its allies
were already too heavily implicated in t

But what woes it actually rest ea?
First, presu:nably, the celebrated memorandum
of ITT which suggested ways of preventing
Allende froin assuming the Presidency in 1970
and of toppling his regime if he did so. There is,
of course, no doubt of this memorandum's
authenticity, nor of its appalling folly; and with
such organisations admittedly pushing their
conspiratorial notions at the heart of American
politics it is not surprising that suspicions of
Yanquí skuldurgery were aroused. But there is a
major snag for anyone who sees the memorandum
as evidence of actual dirty work: simply, that all.

Washington Lave been treated during the Water-
gate crisis (including the allegations of Nixon's
personal involvement with ITT), I am hard-
pressed to believe that if such assent had been
given it could have been kept quict until now.

Secondly, in support of the American inter
vention theory, it is pointed out that the U.S.
maintained its contacts with the Chilean armed
forces and continued to supply them with arms
when other American aid to Chule was sus
pended. Therefore, so the implication goes, the 1.
Pentagon was deliberately keeping open the
option of Inspiring a military coup against an.
unwelcome government. But this is obviously a
two-edged argument. For one thing, an army
that is still getting its toys to play with is usually
rather more than less likely to endure the follies
of its tuling politicians gladly. And for another,
what would have been said if the Americans had
actually suspended arms shipments to forces
whose commanders were serving in Allende's
cabinet? The outery about "Yanqui imperialism"
and "Pentagon politics" may easily be imagined.

Thirdly, the strangulation of foreign aid and
credit is laid at Washington's door as a major
weapon in a cold war against Allende from the
start. At first glance this has more substance to it.
The U.S. certainly suspended further commercial
credits of its own to Chile after Aliende had
nationalised the American-owned copper mines
on terms amounting to contion. As the major
power in the World Rank and the IMF the U.S.
also argued there against further aid for Chile:
and to the extent that it was successful it must have
added to Allende's financial difliculties. But it
was not able to prevent other Western countries
(e.g. Holland and Sweden) from continuing to
offer credit; it never persuaded Britain to clase
down its small aid programme; it did not exclude
the re-scheduling of most of Chile's foreign debt
repayments in 1972 and it had not prevented the
discussion (incomplete at the time of the coup)
of a similar re-scheduling for 1973. In short, the
U.S. influence may have limited Western aid and
credit but it was far from being able to condemn
Allende's Chile to economis purdah. In any case,
Chile was not one of the under-developed world's
hard cases, totally dependrat on external aid and
credits for its survival The wealth of its copper
mines alone ensured that in normal times it was

the blame for Chile's economic difficulties could

from most of the governments which professed to

thusiastic (but not always practical) advice to
Allende, as well as supplying arms and training
for his militant Left, the world's established Mara
ist governments were consistently cool to the
"Chilean experiment." The farthest the Soviet
Union would go to show its approval was to
open a 12-year credit in roubles for lean

but even if he had, it might not have worked. To support Castro's Cuba is televed to have cost Moscow the equivalent of stout $1 million a day for inany years. To support a similar réguno in Chile would probably have cost even more. There was never the slightest sign that Mr Brezhnev, or anyone else in the Kremlin, was ready to accept such a burden.

To sum up, then, it seems to me that the idea of an American conspiracy to overthrow Allende is both unproven and unnecessary to explain his downfall. I am not saying, of course, that Washington was not relieved to see him go; although I think some American officials would have preferied to see him stumbison for sometime longer in the hope that growing disillusionment would infect even bis stoutest supporters and accordingly diminish the chances of his being made a martyr when nenmesis finally overtook him. But in general the American attitude scems to have boen a predictably cautious one:

*Thou shalt not kill, but neef'st not strive*

*Officlously to keep alive....*

A realistic Chilean government embarked on its "road to socialisın" would surely have bargained for that much, and (on a truly Marxist analysia such as Alitude professed) it should have expected much more that America would move in for the kill as soon as possible. Yet while adopting a deliberately provocative stance, Allende took no steps to protect himself against possible American reprisals, declined to compromiso for the sako of other Western help, and failed to provide grounds even for his supposed Marxist friends to help him.

It was magnificent, perhaps, but it was not politics. At the very least, Allende noust to convicted here of a lack of realism that would probably have boen fatal to any statesman any-where.

2. The Ruling Class
   Conspiracy Myth

THE PICTURE of Allende being overthrown by what has been variously described as a "revolt of the privileged" a series of "bosses' strikes" or a "conspiracy of the traditional ruling class" contains so many misconceptions that it is hard to know where to begin to sort them out. One idea, however, seems basic to them all: that Allende and his Popular Unity coalition were somehow the uniquely legitimate representatives of "the People's Will" That such an odd belief should have gained any currecсу whatever outside purely propagandist circles is a mark of the confusion that surrounds the Chilean experience in the minds of many non-Chileans. To judge from published comments, such as those referring to the "defeat of the democratic will", some of Allende's sympathisers abroad seem even to believe that he not merely enjoyed a massive popular majority of the vote but was also the first President of his country to do so.

Yet the facts are beyond dispute. Chile was and had been for many years a functioning democracy with a constitution which vested executive power in the President and legislative power in Congress. Both in theory and in practice, no doubt, there were serious weaknesses-es revez'd, for instance, in the inability of previous

to press through social reforms ei wiftly es many Collars would have wished. But by co mon comment the system was the best and most stable in Latin Amerion and it had enabled Zende himself to coatest the Presidency unsucity three times before he finally won it at his from attempt in 1970. There was no doubt of the legitimacy of that victory. But, unfortunately for those who saw it as a unique expression of "the people's will", it was gained only through a narrow plurality in which Allende obtained just over 562% of the poll. Ilis nearest rival, ody a couple of percentatge points behind was the candidate of tie conservative National Party, where members in Congress opposed Allende from the start. Another 28% went to the third candidate, a radical reformist from the Christian Democrat party, many of whose members in Congress at first gave Allende the benefit of the doubt, hoping he would modify hit avowel Marxiun in practice to a kind of reformiam compatible with their own ideas and the existing constitution.

In the mid-term Congressionali elections of March 1973, the Popular Unity coalition raised Its share of the vote to 41% (although this tima the "legitimacy" was suspect owing to opposition allegations of substantial eloctoral fraud). But the opposition parties retained a large majority: lo Congress where, by that time, most of the Qiristian Democrats had joined the Nationalista in outright antagoniun to the President. On these facts it veure plain that, so far froin representing "Die J'eople's Will", Allende never actually ro precated more than a substantial minority Interest. Only if "the l'eople" are identified as being those who voted for Allende, while the rest -the majority-are relegated to the status of "non-people" can any other interpretation be sustain 1. But that, of course, is just what is implied by the myth of the "ruling class conspiracy."

IP THERE WAS a "ruling class" in Chile it was tha of the politicians and the surrounding establishment drawn mostly from the narrow upper end of Chiie's prosperous middle class. Allende himself and many of his ininisters and leading supportas were as much part of that group as, were their political opponents. But, ironically, it was a group that often zuTered less than others from Allende's socialism because its members on both sides generally possessed enough cash or property to exploit the black market at home or slip into Byreeable exile if things got too rough-in any case, to survive (like Allende himself until his death) in very reasonable comfort. But the people who did most to overthrow Allende were rarely of this group at all. With the possible exception of some naval officers, the armed forces were very much apart from the establislunent of any political colour; and even after Allende brought the service commanders into his government they remained aloof from, and remarkably little known by, those relatively small circles in Santiago which were accustomed to set the country's political tone.

Indeed, as events since the coup d'état hav shown, Chile's military men-like their counter parts elsewhere were probably as contemptuous of the politicians (and as ignorant el poütics) as the politicians were of them. They had stayed outside politics for nearly 40 years, and if Allende

But their position was made tolerable by the
President's own decisions. On the one hand Uvy
were encouraged to turn a blind eye to the steady
growth of illegal, para-military fones under the
command of the President's friends or others who
were more extreine in their revolutionary com-
mitment. On the other hand they were required
to serve in his cabinet to maintain "law and
order and reassure the country of the President's
constitutional propriety. On top of that they
were threatened by attempts from within the
President's own circle to subvert their authority
within their own forces, as in the naval con!
spiracy uncovered in July 1973, and the public
call for a navel insurrection by Allrade's friend i
and fellow-leader of the Socialist Party, Senator
Carlos Altamirano, made only three day's before
the coup.

A surer way can hardly be imagined of pro-
voking mutiny among responsibis etfisers, and

either of military men in general or of Chile's mili.
tary in particular.

SIMILARLY, THE SO-CALLED "bosses' strikes" which
preceded the military coup were, in fact, nothing
of the kind. The lorry men who paralysed half,
or more, of Chile's transport by their month-long
strike in September-October 1972, and their even
longer strike in July-September 1973, were mostly
owner-drivers who would have fitted fairly readily
into the Teamsters' Union in the United States.
They displayed the fierce economic and social pro-
tectionism typical of what in Europe or North
America would be called the lower middle class,
and they saw themselves threatened by galloping
inflation and by what they believed to be the
Government's intention to destroy their way of
'life through state control or ownership of their
services. Along with the small shopkeepers who
supported thein-not forgetting the queue-weary
housewives whose famous "Saucepan March" in
Santiago was the most dramatic early sign of
revolt-they might be classed as the Poujadistes
of Chile. But by no stretch of the imagination
could they be described as representatives of a
"boss" or "ruling" class, or even as being
especially "privileged" in a socid or economic
sense. Moreover, they owed little, if any, allegiance
to the traditional political groupings of Chilean
politics, although they obviously welcomed any
support they could get from them. On the
contrary, they tended to cut across the traditional
spectrum and look to new leaders, whether of
right or Icft. Thus, their principal spokesman,
Senor Loon Vilarin, was actually a member of
Allende's Socialist Party while others of the
leadership came from the Nationalist Party raaks

"Although even that was not unthinkable towards

The members of the various professional
associations, like doctors, dentists, lawyers and
airline pilots, which joined the second transport
strike, were likewise not "bosses" although they
were certainly, in Chulean terms, rather more
"privilegel" Their protest was probably more
ideological than that of the lorry-men and the
shopkeepers-it was usually their wives, for
example, who objected most forcibly to the
Government's politically-inspired changes in the
school curriculum-but it was also provoked by
sheer exasperation and fear at the growing
threat to their professional status posed by the

Govempient's coinbination of acninistrative
inctliciency and dubious social priorities. For
example, Chile's economic collapse and ir.Mation
not only threatened many doctors financially
but seriously frustrated their work. Some early
reports from Santiago after the roup made the
point that hospitals were appealing urgently
for bandages and drugs to treat the wounded,
as if that indicated that the number of casualties
must be overwhelmingly high. But bandages,
drugs, and other niedical supplies had been only
sporadically obtainable in Chile for many months
beforehand. The daily round of the pharmacies
in search of the simplest medicines had become a .
regular feature of Santiago life; and foreign
erabassies had been driven to stock-pile their own
supplies, imported through the diplomatic bag,
for the treatment of the most normal ailments
among their staffs. It was partly in the hope of
ending that situation that many otherwise
conscientious doctors finally joined the movement
to get Allende out.

NOR
SHOULD IT DE FORGOTTEN that some of the
most damaging strikes of all were those of
Chile's most influential blue-collar workers-the
copper-miners. The last lorry-men's strike was
immediately preceded by a two months' strike for
higher wages by miners at El Tenicate, the coun-
try's biggest mine. Because copper accounts for
three-quarters of Chile's foreign earnings, that
strike probably cost the country far more in real
termis than the transport strike, whose costs to a
great extenf could be absorbed internally. Indeed,
as one West European diplomat remarked to me
in Santiago, the money lost in those two months
at El. Teniente would have more than repaid
Chile's entire debt to his government-a debt
which Allende at that moment was trying to ro
schedule for the second consecutive year.

It is true that the copper-miners were the elite!
of Chile's blue-collar class and, no doubt,
wanted to keep it that way. To that extent,
perhaps, they may be deemed "privileged"-
like, say, coal miners or motor car workers in
Britain; although I doubt if that is what members
of the British Labour Party, or the New Statesman,
can have had in mind in embracing the "privi-
leged" thesis. But a more important reason for the
miners' restiveness, I believe, is that although
they were the most vital of all Chile's manual
workers they suffered far more than most of
their erstwhile comrades from the country's
shattering economic decline under Allende. Un-
like farm and factory workers, they could not
supplement their oficial wages by selling the
fruits of their labour on the black market. The
farm worker who could take home a cock


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 92

could make a good living on the black market!
even if his official wages remained stationary
while inflation roared ahead. The factory worker
who was entitled to buy a proportion of his
factory's output at official fixed, prices could
(and did) seil that at six or ten times what he had
paid as soon as he left the factory gate. But
miners could hardly find ready buyers for a stolen
truck-load of copper ore. !!
Thus the copper-miners were thrust, in effect,
into the same position as the lorry-men, the shop-
keepers, and virtually all of Chile's salaried
professional men and women: they were left
more or less defenceless against the most vicious
inflation the country had ever experienced.

SOME APOLOGISTS for Allende have maintained
that the degree of inflation was exaggerated or,
at any rate, little worse than was customary in
Chile and elsewhere in Latin America. The truth
is that it was far beyond anything normally
endured in that continent. As little as nine
montes after Allende came to power, when I
first visited Chile, the escudo had already fallen
from 20 to 40 against the U.S. dollar on the free,
or black, market. Eighteen months later, on my
second visit, the Government's own figures put
the rate of inflation at 130% in a year, the money
issue was going up by 10% a month and the
escudo had fallen to about 350 to the black US.
dollar. Ily August 1973, the official inflation rate
was 323% and rising fast, and the excudo was
worth only 2,000 to the dollar-an effective
devaluation in less than three years of 10,000%!
Nor is it enough to attribute these catastrophic
rates to such adventitious or inalicious factors
as-and egain I refer to published arguments
falling wworld copper prices, the normal difficulties
of maintaining industrial and farm output in a
time of radical political change, or deliberate
American intervention.

On the last of these three I have already said
enough, I hope, to show that it was far from
decisive and that it was,, anyway, largely self-
invited. As to falling copper prices, the fact is
that after a fall in the first year of Allende's
Government, prices recovered until by the time
of his overthrow they were 80% above the level
at the time of his election. Had they not risen
so steeply he would almost certainly have falleo
soones and probably would not have secured his
selative, short-lived success in the mid-term
elections of March 1973. The difficulties of main-
taining output in a time of change, however, were
real-unfortunately, far more so than Allende
ever seemed to realise.

Expropriation of the copper mines from their

at least. But this might have been overcome by
the promotion of trained Chilean nanagers and
technicians, of whom there was no shortage.

Alas, for Chile's national income, Allende not
merely nationalised but deliberately politicised
the mines as well. Jobs for the party boys were
handed out in thousands while trained Chileans

### Constitutional Revolutionary

H
ERE WE COuz to the crum of Allende's
policies and character about which, finally,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

# 14-00000

all the other arguments revolve. Was he a genuine constitutionalist? Was he a true revolutionary? Was he—could he ever have been—both?

Allende himself, of course, admitted no doubts. Repeatedly, he insisted that he was a revolutionary and a Marxist, and that he intended to establish at least the preconditions for what he told Régis Debray would be “total, scientific Marxist socialism.” Equally repeatedly, he proclaimed his faith that he could achieve this end by constitutional means, through the ballot box and all it implied. That was, after all, to be the distinctive “Chilean road to socialism” of which so many people outside Chile cherished such high hopes.

But no hindsight is required to see that both theory and practice were riddled with contradictions. Revolutions are born of, or generate, sectional conflict—a fact of political life that Allende acknowledged every time he spoke of “overthrowing” what he called the “bourgeois” state. But a democratic constitution rests upon consensus—a basic acceptance of the fact that the State represents more than a merely sectional interest. The second permits reform, but the first denies it; and there is no way of reconciling the two.

All Allende’s practical difficulties followed from this simple distinction. Taken seriously, his constitutionalism meant that his programme could only succeed if a majority would actually vote for it. But, elected as he was with only just over a third of the popular vote and with a large majority of Congress against him, Allende had neither a democratic nor an administratively effective mandate for his revolution. Indeed, in a parliamentary rather than a presidential democracy, he would probably never have been able to begin.

If he was to succeed within his six-year term of office even in opening the door to revolution, let alone establishing it as accomplished fact, he had to transform his minority into a majority. But how to do it? For, if words meant anything, Allende’s had to mean that he intended to replace the existing, reformable constitution of Chile with another that would be, of its Marxist nature, irreversible. In other words, a system that was admittedly democratic was to be used to build another that would be effectively dictatorial. This was asking the majority to hang itself from its own gallows; and, not surprisingly, it declined

ALLENDE’S ATTEMPTS to overcome this basic illogicality in his position were precisely what ensured his ultimate downfall. Refusing to abandon either his revolutionary rhetoric or his professed constitutionalism he was forced to rely more and more upon political illusionism. His sleight-of-hand was often remarkable, as he sought to outwit the opposition majority in Congress by exploiting the letter of the constitution, using every legal loophole to force upon them measures they did not want. But in the process, inevitably, he destroyed the constitution’s spirit, so that his opponents became as ruthless as he.

> Indeed, as I discovered for myself on a visit to southern Chile nine months after Allende’s efictions, local police forces there were under speculi instructions not to attempt to restore the farms to their legal owners. See also Robert Moss’s report in ESQVUNTEA, “Allende’s Chile”, August 1971, and Altair Horne’s “Commandante Pepe”, July 1971.

was. At the start he won considerable opposition support in Congress for needed change like the nationalization of the copper mines, land reform, and the state’s takeover of banks and major Industrie-evidence that the democratic consensus could and would work within the existing constitution. But, at the end, not a single member of the opposition majority would cast a vote in his support. They voted unanimously to condemn his “habitual illegalities” and were even joined by the Supreme Court in accusing him of disregarding the rule of law. He had cut away the middle ground of Chilean politics, wrecked the democratic consensus, and begotten the reality of counter-revolution through his own addiction to revolutionary slogans.

Equally inevitable was the economic breakdown, which came from Allende’s attempts to enlarge his popular base outside the political institutions. Here his plan was two-fold: to buy political support among “the People” through massive wage increases and other benifits and at the same time to squeeze the caudillo class into submission, or even flight from the country, through wholesale nationalisation of their interests and the appointment of his own men to all significant civil-service jobs. The two simply cancelled each other out; for while the first part of the plan raised vast new expectations and demands, the second diminished the country’s capacity to meet them. The whirling spiral of inflation followed as a necessary result of Allende’s political confusions.

THESE BASIC CONTRADICTIONS were compounded by the fragmented nature of Allende’s support. His Popular Unity coalition was far from united. Its majority element was Allende’s own Socialist Party—a body that bore little resemblance beyond its name to most of the democratic socialist parties of Europe which so enthusiastically espoused its cause. It was, in fact, a revolutionary Marxist party that began as a splinter of the more bureaucratic and Stalinist Chilean Communist party in the 1930s, and in recent years had acquired a fiery “New Left” wing as weil. Several of its leaders, like Senator Altamirano, and many of its rank and file, constantly urged Allende to “speed up the revolution” without much regard for constitutional niceties. The smallest element of the coalition was the Christian radicals of various persuasions, some of whom hoped to offer a bridge to the centre of Chilean politics by cooperating with the left wing of the Christian Democrats, but none of whom ever attained positions of real influence. The coalition’s sheet anchor was the Communist Party which, as business and administration slipped into chaos, became increasingly important as a source of discipline and strategic thinking.

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN hard enough to drive this troika anyway without either overstepping the constitutional limits of government or antagonising one or other of its elements and thereby jeopardising the only “democratic” base the revolution had. But Allende had also to contend with the still more militant left outside the coalition, led by the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), which insisted on revolution now, and by vioience if necessary—as, in MIR’s view, it was.

Here Allende’s professed constitutionalism was

revealed nt, et leol aquivient He officially rejected MIlR's violence, yet he never permitted the Artury to root out theit para-military grous When they stigmatised his land-reform programme as "inadequate" and seized hundreds of farrns at gun-point he rebuked them in occasional spoocha but did nothing to reverse their actions. Wien Uey hi-jacked lorry-loads of valuable manufactures, to raise funds by selling them on: the black market, he rarely tried to redress the i crime. The Left-said this was because the MIR truly represented "the People" against whom Allende dared not act. But the truth, I fear, was more squalid For one thing, the MIR had close friends in the Socialist Party and in Allende's own entourage whom the President did not want to oflend. For another, as long as their activities did not actually split the Popular Unity coalition, it was often convenient to see them pushing along the revolution by unconstitutional means while Allende denounced them in his role as a constitutionalist.

It was not as if Allende was unable to deal with the MIR when he had to. For example, when a Mirita force blockaded the Philips television-factory in Santiago in 1973 after an unsuccessful attempt to hi-jack a lorry-load of TV sets, they were allowed by the Government to remain urmolested for ten days, although a: police post was just across the road. Yet when diplomatic representations were made by the Dutch chargé d'affaires with the hint that his country's financial aid might have to be recon-1 sidered if this harassment of a Dutch enterprise: continued, the Miristas were hustled away without a shot in 24 hours.

A SIMILAR EQUIVOCATION Was evident in Allende's adoption of a personal arned bodyguard-the first in memory to accompany a Chilean President. It is true that the extreme Right in Chile was quick to threaten violence as a response to Allende's proclaimed revolution, and Allende himself always maintained that he needed pro-tection. But right-wing para-military groups were never as big or as highly organised as those on the Left; and, in any case, the proper reaction of a constitutionally-minded President would surely bave been to call upon his state security forces to protect him.

Instead, Aliende formed a personal unit, known as "the Group of Friends of the Pro-sident" Trained, armed, and partly manned by "Cubans, it was led by known revolutionaries, sympathetic to the MIR, including Alleade's son-in-law. The existence of such a group at the very centre of the State was not merely a pro-vocation to the established security forces and an affront to Chilean tradition, it was also an implied rejection of the principle of constitutional rule.

DOUBTS ABOUT the real depth of Allende's con-stitutionalism were raised also by his personal history and his language, both of which suggested a romantic attachiuncat o violence. He was, after all, a founder and first president of the Latin American Solidarity Organisation, created in Havana in the 1960s and dedicated to the encouragement of arined insurrection throughout the continent. He promised to "palet Santiago with blood" in 1970 if Congress Ceclined to ratify his clection as President, and he repeatedly tried to intimidate the opposition, inside and outside Congress, with the threat of civil war. These were not the actions or the sentiments of a man dedicated to constitutional change, except as a matter of expediency.

On the other hand, it was hard to see Allende as a genuine revolutionary. He never looked anything but the complete bourgeois gentleman. A bon viveur, Corid but well-groomed, a snappy dresser, with a twinkling eye for the ladies and a: good deal of personal charm, his strongest political card was his skill in tactical manoeuvre. But as a strategist, a thinker, a man with a real message, he was unconvincing. Towards the end, as he appeared with increasing frequency on the presidential balcony in Santiago to address chanting crowds of his supporters with revolutionary platitudes, he seemed to me to lose all contact with reality, to have become an actor in love with his revolutionary part rather than a serious leader who knew where he was going.

IN RETROSPECT, I am inclined to think this was always the truth of the matter with Allende. Basically, he was a political romantic, dealing in sensations rather than sense. He enjoyed his hour upon the stage but he never properly assessed the forces he was dealing with, either for or against him. He raised expectations on his owa side without commanding the means to satisfy them, and he encouraged opposition on the other side by his use of a revolutionary rhetoric whose threats he also could not fultil.

At best he was muddle-headed; and time may show that he was deliberately deceitful. Certainly he managed to deceive a lot of people, including himself. But in the end reality taught its own, hard lessons. That you can't be a denocrat and a revolutionary at least, not in a society that is already admittedly democratic. That you can't be anti-American and expect the Americans to help you. That you can't pose as the people's leader and kick most people in the teeth. That you can't conscript soldiers into politics and expect them to remain apolitical. That you can't have inflation roaring out of sight and maintain a base for social welfare. That, in short, the real world is not Cloud-cuckoo-land. Down here, you just can't have your cake and eat it

It is sad that such elementary lessons should have to be taught yet again at such tragic cost in Chile. But it is alarming that so many people elsewhere should evidently fail to grasp that they are the lessons.

# KULTUR 3

# Allendes misstag

Den svenska debatten är ensidig. Man har på ett lysande sätt dokumenterat juntans grymheter men man drar ingen lärdom av utvecklingen i Allendes Chile. Det är viktigt att kunna kritisera det som var fel i utvecklingen, annars kan man inte lära sig någonting. Om man tystar ner varje form av debatt om det som var före kuppen, använder man sig av ett censurtänkande som är på samma linje som juntans, säger Andres Küng, journalist och författare som besökt Chile före, under och efter Allendes tid. Han har nu också givit ut en debattbok, Att så socialism och skörda fascism.

– Salvator Allende och "folkregeringen" Unidad Popular (folklig enhet) emotsågs med stort intresse även utomlands. Man skulle äntligen få svar på flera grundläggande frågor. Kan socialismen genomföras på fredlig väg i Latinamerika? Är marxismen i grunden förenlig med politisk demokrati? Kan en social revolution genomföras med bevarad politisk demokrati?

– Folkfrontens program hade fyra naturtillgångar, främst kopparn, 2) ökad takt i jordreformsarbetet, 3) förstatligande av de största bank- och industriföretagen och 4) snabb ekonomisk tillväxt och omfördelning av inkomster och förmögenheter samt kamp mot inflationen.

## Koppar viktig.

– Kopparn svarar för upp till fyra femtedelar av landets export och mellan en femtedel och en tredjedel av statsintäkterna. Under åren före första världskriget gick gruvorna över i nordamerikansk ägo. I slutet av 1960-talet nationaliserades de till hälften av den kristdemokratiska Frei-regimen. Staten övertog 51 procent av aktierna. Men Freis "chilenisering" av kopparn visade sig slutligen ändå mest lönsam för de amerikanska företagen. Kopparn förstatligades genom ett tillägg till grundlagen 1971. Frågan om ersättning till de forna amerikanska ägarna hänsköts till högste statschefen – men Allende och hans regering ansåg att de inte hade råd att betala kontant ersättning i dollar.

– Jordbruket svarar för mindre än en fjärdedel av sysselsättningen, vilket är mindre än i de flesta latinamerikanska och andra u-länder. Flera jordreformlagar antogs före Allende en av dem 1967 då man bestämde att alla jordegendomar över 80 "bashektar" kunde tvångsinlösas, (en bashektar = en hektar förstklassig konstvattnad jord).

– Takten i jordreformarbetet ökade under Allendes presidenttid. Under hans första år tvångsinlöstes nästan lika mycket jord som under hela den föregående sexåriga presidentperioden. Alla stora jordegendomar ha förstatligats 1973.

– I följd av jordreformen var att lantarbetarna organiserades fackligt. En annan var jordockupationerna. De ökade nu gånger redan under Allendes första år jämfört med under Freis tid. Jordägarna började gå till motangrepp.

– Produktionen sjönk – de exproprierade gårdarna hade inte tillräckligt med maskiner, redskap, kreatur och utsäde. Den sjunkande tillgången på livsmedel och den stigande efterfrågan ledde till försörjningsproblem och prisstegringar.

– I början genomförde Allende en rad åtgärder för att skapa en jämnare fördelning av förmögenhe

![Andres Küng, journalist och författare]

Andrea Küng, journalist och författare, säger att Chile-debatten är ensidig. "Det är viktigt att även kunna kritisera det som var fel på Allendes tid annars kan man inte lära sig någonting".

svarta börsaffärer och hamstring. Penningvärdet sjönk med 103 procent.

– Under min vistelse i Santiago i början av 1973 var enbart cigarettköerna i centrum ett par kvarter långa, berättar Andres Küng.

## Förlorade stödet

– De ekonomiska problemen medförde politiska problem. Allende förlorade medelklassens stöd och arbetarklassens stöd minskade. I kongressvalen behövde han majoritet – en nödvändig förutsättning för att han skulle kunna fortsätta att genomföra sitt program och stifta sina lagar. Han fick bara 44 procent. Maktkampen kongress – parlament – president fortsatte. Ingen ville ge vika för den andre. Allende drevs till åtgärder som inte var förenliga med demokratiska principer och gällande lagar.

– Denna utveckling tyder på att varje försök att mot flertalets vilja tvinga fram en extrem politik medför risker för polarisering av samhället som bara skulle gynna odemokratiska riktningar. En aggressiv klasspolitik, vare sig den är reaktionär eller revolutionär, kan framkalla en utveckling mot en socialistisk eller fascistisk diktatur, konstaterar Andres Küng.

– Men inga missförhållanden och misstag under Allendes tid kan användas som ursäkt för kuppen och det blodbad som sedan följde. Man kan ha olika uppfattningar om Allendes politik, men varje sann demokrat måste känna avsky för den nuvarande militärjuntan.

NETHERLANDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Editorial by N. van Nieuwenhuysen; Reformatorisch Dagblad,
Dutch, 19 April 1974, P5

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be having adjustment problems. These rather prolonged symptoms seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of their Marxist president is definitely over and that their country is now being ruled by a small group of reactionaries who are trying to keep the people under control through terrorism, repression, and torture. Such problems will take you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

What is the situation? Most of the approximately 250 refugees with a high school or university education do not work. About half of them have been housed at the "Huis ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. Board and lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they are better off than many old people in the Netherlands? You are probably right, because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare: they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile. So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

Considering that this small group of pampered exiles is preaching revolution even here and with a full stomach, it may be useful to point out a few facts. These are facts which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague but for some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

## Facta

The great majority of the refugees are not even Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay. They came to Chile as a result of illegal and revolutionary activities in which they had been involved in these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende showed sympathy for their situation. His first action as president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to declare amnesty for all those who "were members of terrorist underground organizations," those who during the last months of his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and attempted murder.

The fact that some of those revolutionaries received Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries. These refugees with a high school or higher level education seemed to have no adjustment problems in Chile. As a result they soon found their way to important key positions in the government.

The fugitives didn't suffer any sleepless nights in Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant Marxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutionaries, from all points of the compass, were at their disposal.

## Definition

In the Berner Tageblatt, a Swiss newspaper which is known for not exaggerating, Dr. Mario Puelma, from the University of Freiburg, wrote the following: "The concept of political refugee is only of limited value when applied to Chile. Whatever one's attitude toward the military junta


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

may be, one thing is certain: the Chilean refugees were not pursued only because of their ideology, their status, or their origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian definition for a refugee. For the most part they are people who, in their own country, could be legally charged with crimes which are punishable under any Judicial system.

These refugees carried out activities in Chilo which were against the constitution. As a matter of fact, they are specialists in violence. This is why they sought asylum in the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are so many foreigners among them."

2. THE REPORTAGE WOULD PROBABLY BE DESIGNED FOR 30-MINUTE
   AIRING, AND WOULD HOPEFULLY CONTAIN FILMED INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL
   PINOCHET AND VISIT TO DAWSON ISLAND. WHILE WE BELIEVE THIS WOULD
   BE FIRST INTERVIEW GRANTED TO FRENCH JOURNALIST BY THE HEAD OF
   RULING JUNTA (THUS BIG BOOST FOR UNSOBER/1), WE UNDERSTAND PINOCHET
   HAS GRANTED OTHER INTERVIEWS AND ALLOWED FILMING ON DAWSON ISLAND.
   PROPOSAL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY DISCUSSED WITH UNSOBER/1, AND HE HAS
   SAID REPORTAGE WOULD BE FAVORABLE BUT NOT TOTALLY UNCRITICAL--BEST
   TREATMENT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT COULD HOPE FOR IN FRANCE.Y

3. TO OBTAIN INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL PINOCHET AND OTHER JUNTA
   LEADERS AND/OR PERMISSION BEFILM CONDITIONS ON DAUSON ISLAND AND
   ELSEWHERE IN CHILE, UNSOBER/1 HAS ASKED FOR BKHERALD ASSISTANCE.
   UNSOBER/L IS CONFIDENT THAT SUPERIORS WOULD APPROVE PROGRAM IF
   UNSOBER/1 COULD ASSURE THEM THAT HE WOULD BE GRANTED INTERVIEWS, ETC.Y

2. THE OUTLOOK FOR CHILE IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. THE NEW MILITARY GOVERNMENT HAS AVOIDED MAJOR INTERNAL CONFLICTS AND HAS MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO REORGANIZE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MORE EFFICIENTLY, TO CREATE AN APOLITICAL CIVIL SERVICE, AND TO CORRECT THE EXCESSES OF NEARLY THREE YEARS OF DECAPITALIZATION UNDER STATE SOCIALISM. ITS ECONOMIC PROGRAMS, ALTHOUGH AUSTERE, ARE SOUND AND OFFER A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR RECOVERY AND GROWTH OF THE CHILEAN ECONOMY. THE STRICT SECURITY MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE JUNTA HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING ANY LARGE-SCALE VIOLENCE OR TERRORISM AND ARE LIKELY TO BE CONTINUED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

CENTRAL BANK DEVALUED THE ESCUDO BY SOME 60% IN AN EFFORT TO CURB IMPORT DEMAND AND EASE PRESSURES ON THE COUNTRY'S MEAGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES. AS A RESULT, CHILE'S COST OF LIVING JUMPED 88% IN OCTOBER, AND OTHER PRICE RISES PUSHED INFLATION TO SOME 770% FOR THE YEAR.

4. THE JUNTA HAS NOW AGREED TO FOLLOW THE STABILIZATION[^3] PROGRAM PROPOSED BY AN IMF TEAM WHICH VISITED CHILE IN LATE 1974. THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING INFLATION TO 100% IN 1974. THIS IMF PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE BUT MAY BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACER-BATING THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING INFLATION. ADHERENCE TO THE INF PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVED CHILE'S COREDIT RATING, AS HAS THE SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON CHILE'S 1971-1972 DEBT. CHILE IS THUS IN A RELATIVELY GOOD POSITION FOR THE OPENING OF THE PARIS CLUB TALKS IN FEBRUARY. THE MASSIVE $4 BILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN DEBT, HOWEVER, WILL CAUSE CHILE BALANCE OF BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS FOR SOME TIME.

CIVILIAN ADVISERS TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES. THIS PHENOMENON IS MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND IN SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE IS WELL KNOWN. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AN ADVISORY BOARD DOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, WHILE THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT-ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS AFFECTED BY THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.

11. IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KNOWN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IF INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEW CONSTITUTION, BUT THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, COLLECTING INFORMATION ON UECHMPLOYMENT, WRITING A STATUTE FOR WORKER PARTICIPATION IN BUSINESS ENTERPRISES, AND

12. ALTHOUGH SOME CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS HOLD INFLUENTIAL GOVERNMENT POSITIONS, MOST CIVILIAN ADVISERS ARE EITHER CONSERVATIVE OR APOLITICAL. LACK OF MORE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION BY CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS MAY CREATE PROBLENS FOR THE GOVERMENT IN THE FUTURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING WORKERS, CAMPESINOS AND POBLADORES (WHICH FORMERLY SUPPORTED EITHER THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDC) OR THE ALLENDE GOVERNMENT) ARE SO FAR INADEQUATELY REPRESENTED ON ADVISORY COUNCILS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED UNITS ADDRESSED TO YOUTH, WOMEN, GUILDS AND NEIGHBOR-HOOD CIVIC GROUPS IN THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT, AND HOPES THAT THESE WILL SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR GOVERNMENT-TO-PEOPLE COMMUNICATION.

IN ORDER TO REGAIN SOME OF THE TERRITORY LOST IN THAT WAR. THE CHILEANS ARE WORRIED BY THE SOVIET SALE OF ARNS TO PERU AND FEAR THAT THE USSR MAY BE TRY-ING TO CREATE ANOTHER UNSTABLE "MIDDLE EAST TYPE" OF CLIMATE IN LATIN AMERICA.

15. THE JUNTA IS ALSO CONCERNED BY COMMUNIST EFFORTS TO CREATE INTERNAL DISCONTENT AND TO MOUNT AN INTERNAL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT. THE JUNTA EXPECTS THAT THE FORINER UP PARTIES, LED BY THE COMMUNISTS.

WHILE EXCHANGE RATES CHANGED AND PRICES ROSE, THE GROUTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS BEEN SHARPLY CURTAILED, CAUSING A RELATIVE SCARCITY OF LOCAL CURRENCY AND A LIQUIDITY CRUNCH FOR BUSINESSMEN.

D. THE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS HAS BEEN HEAVY. DESPITE A HEALTHY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE, WORKING CLASS CONSUMERS ARE FINDING IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THE BAREST NECESSITIES. AUSTERITY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED IN MANY CASES BY DISMISSALS OF RELATIVELY UNPRODUCTIVE AND POLITICALLY SUSPECT EMPLOYEES HIRED UNDER THE ALLENDE REGIME. AN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED AND AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM IS UNDER CON- SIDERATION.

FAILURE FOR THE JUNTA.

F. CHILE STILL FACES LARGE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS DEFICITS IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974 EVEN IF DEBT-REPAYMENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH YEARS. WITH A MASSIVE #4 BILLION FOREIGN DEBT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANCE-OF- PAYMENTS POSITION IMPROVES SIGNIFICANTLY.

G. HOWEVER, COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED MORE THAN 50% ABOVE LAST YEAR'S LEVEL AS A RESULT OF A 9% LENGTHENING OF THE WORK WEEK AND IMPROVED MINE MANAGEMENT. PRODUCTION WILL PROBABLY REACH A RECORD 750,000 TONS NEXT YEAR DESPITE CONTINUING SHORTAGES OF SPARE PARTS AND SERVICEABLE VEHICLES.

H. AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST DRAIN ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND THE RECOVERY OF DOMESTIC PRODUCTION IS A PRIORITY OBJECTIVE OF THE JUNTA. FARM OUTPUT, HOWEVER, IS NOT EXPECTED TO FULLY RECOVER UNTIL THE 1974/75 HARVEST SINCE MOST CROPS ALREADY ARE PLANTED AND ARE WELL INTO THEIR GROWING SEASONS. THUS, CHILE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPORT GRAIN IN LARGE QUANTITIES DURING 1974.

OF RAW MATERIALS AND SPARE PARTS MUST BE SOLVED TO BOOST PRODUCTION QUICKLY, LONG RUN GROWTH WILL DEPEND HEAVILY ON CHILE'S ABILITY TO ATTRACT ADEQUATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT. ATTRACTION OF SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENT WILL DEPEND ON THE JUNTA'S ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD WELL AS FAITH IN THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EQUITY AS THEIR ABILITY TO INSTILL CONFIDENCE IN CHILE'S PROSPECTS FOR STABLE RECOVERY AND GROWTH. A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IS TIMELY SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING COMPENSBATION CLAIMS EMANATING FROM THE ALLENDE NATIONALIZATIONS. THE JUNTA HAS STATED THAT IT WILL EITHER RETURN INTERVENED FIRMS TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR, AS IN THE CASE OF THE LARGE COPPER MINES, ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE THE PREVIOUS OWNERS. SOME 90 FIRMS ARE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF REVERSION.

J. THUS FAR THE JUNTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN LINING UP SUFFICIENT FOREIGN CREDITS TO ENABLE IT TO PURCHASE ESSENTIAL CAPITAL GOODS AND FINANCE THE CURRENT PAYMENTS GAP. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE STRONG INDICATIONS OF RENEWED INVESTOR CONFICENCE, AND PRIVATE FOR- D EIGN INVESTMENT IN CHILE IS EXPECTED TO GROW DRAMATICALLY DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

K. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR CHIBLE IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTI-
MISTIC AS THE JUNTA TAKES STEPS TO CORRECT THE EXCESSES OF NEARLY
THREE YEARS OF DECAPITALIZATION UNDER STATE SOCIALISM. THE PROGRAMS,
THOUGH AUSTERE, ARE ECONOMICALLY SOUND AND OFFER A FIRM FOUNDATION
FOR RECOVERY AND GROWTH OF THE CHILEAN ECONOMY. THE MAJOR POLICY
CONFLICTS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO BE OVER THE DEGREE AND
TIMING OF SPECIFIC MEASURES RATHER THAN PROBLEMS OF BASIC POLICY
ORIENTATION.

L. THE EMERGING DOMINANCE OF RAUL SAEZ AS SENIOR ECONOMIC
ADVISOR IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST SINCE THE JUNTA'S AUSTERITY PROGRAM
MUST BE TEMPERED IF POLITICAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND
STABILITY IS TO BE ACHIEVED. MEANWHILE, CHILE IS PREPARING TO
SETTLE OUTSTANDING COMPENSATION ISSUES AND COMPLETE BILATERAL NE-
GOTIATIONS ON 1971/72 DEBT SERVICE IN ACCORD WITH THE 1972 PARIS
CLUB AGREEMENTS. TIMELY RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES WILL GO FAR
IN IMPROVING INVESTOR AND CREDITOR CONFIDENCE IN CHILE.

2. FOLLOWING QUESTIONS SUGGESTED TO ELICIT HERMES' VIEWS
   ON CHILE'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AS REQUESTED PARA 3 REF.

INSTRUCTIONS TO PCP/SOVIET MEMBERS WERE TO ARRANGE FOR LODGING FOR
MEMBERS OF OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTIES WHO WERE ARRIVING
IN LIMA, TO OBTAIN MAPS OF CHILE, FALSE DOCUMENTATION, ETC.

6. SECOND STAGE OF SUPPORT TO CHILE WAS TO BEGIN DURING WEEK
   OF 23 SEPTEMBER WHEN COMMUNISTS AND OTHERS WERE TO ARRIVE FROM
   VENEZUELA, PANAMA, COLOMBIA, CUBA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. ALL WERE TO BE
   LODGED IN LIMA, AND, LATER, GIVEN FALSE DOCUMENTS AND TRANSPORTATION

   IN REORGANIZATION OF PCCH FOLLOWING COUP D'ETAT, AS WELL AS IN PRO-
   DUCTION OF CLANDESTINE PROPAGANDA. THEY ALSO WERE TO STUDY POSSI-
   BILITY OF AIDING IN MOUNTING CONCERTED ARMED RESISTANCE TO MILITARY

THROUGH PURCHASES, EXPROPRIATIONS, REQUISITIONS, AND INTERVENTIONS OF PRIVATE SECTOR ENTERPRISES, THE GOC BY MID-1973 HAD CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES ACCOUNTING FOR ALMOST HALF OF CHILE'S GDP, COMPARED TO AN ESTIMATED 20% AT END OF THE FREI ADMINISTRATION IN 1970.

SITUATION BECOMES MORE STABLIZED.

2. (SOURCE COMMENT) MOST OF THE PDC LEADERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY SINCE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE TARGETS FOR ASSASSINATION BY LEFTIST EXTREMISTS AND THAT THEY MAY BECOME THE POLITICAL TARGETS OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE CONCERNED PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFERING OF IMPORTANT POSTS TO RIGHTISTS SUCH AS ORLANDO SAENZ, THE PRESIDENT OF THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY (SOFOFA), WHO HAS BEEN NAMED AS ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN RELATIONS; AND LEON VILARIN, HEAD OF THE TRUCK OWNERS FEDERATION, WHO WAS OFFERED THE POST OF MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS, WHICH HE REFUSED. WHILE SAENZ HAS A NUMBER OF FRIENDLY CONTACTS WITH PDC MEMBERS, HE IS REGARDED BY THE PDC LEADERS AS BASICALLY OPPOSED TO THE PDC AND INTERESTED IN ITS ELIMINATION AS A VIABLE POLITICAL ENTITY.)

3. FREI SAID THAT WHILE HE IS CONSIDERING LEAVING THE COUNTRY OF HIS OWN WILL, HE WOULD PREFER TO BE REQUESTED TO LEAVE BY THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT, IN ORDER TO PROTECT HIS POLITICAL FUTURE. HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT, AND HE WOULD PREFER THAT HIS DEPARTURE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE

Y A SALVAR A CHILE DEL ANIQUILAMIENTO POLITICC, SOCIAL, Y ECONOMICO.

INTENSO Y DISCIPLINADO ESFUERZO QUE RESTABLEZCA EL HABITO DEL
TRABAJO. NORMALICE LAS FAENAS, DETENGA LA DESTRUCCION DEL PATRIMONIO
NACIONALLY REINICIE EL PROCESO DE CAPITALIZACION INDISPENSABLE

CON INNEGABLE SACRIFICIO Y ABNEGATION, LAS FUERZAS
ARMADAS HAS CUMPLIDO SU PAPEL DE SALVAGUARDIA ULTIMA DE LA
INSTITUCIONALIDAD, PERO LA DURA TAREA QUE IMPONE RESTANAR LAS
HERIDAS Y REANUDAR LA MARCHA DE LA NACION EXIGE EL APOYO RESUELTO
DE AQUELLA MAYORIZ CUIDADANA QUE, EN TODOS LOS TONOS, HA PEDIDO
UNA HONDA RECTIFICACION:

EL QUEBRANTAMIENTO CONSTITUCIONAL PROVOCADO POR EL MARXISMO
NO PUDO SOLDARSE CON LAS SOLAS INICIATIVAS DE LOS PARTIDOS
POLITICOS. LAS FUERZAS ARMADAS Y CARABINEROS NO DESEABAN NI
HAD DESEADO NUNCA TOMAR SOBRE SI LA RESPONSIBILIDAD DE CONDUCIR
LOS DESTINOS DE LA NACION, PERO EL DRAMATICO FRACASO DE LA UNIDAD
POPULAR Y LAS LIMITACIONES DEL CUADRO POLITICO OPOSITOR PARA
CONSEGUIR EL INDISPENSABLE CAMBIO DE RUMBO FORZARON LA' SITUACION

CHILE TIENE UN GOBIERNO MILITAR, FORMADO POR LOS SENORES COMANDANTES EN JEFE DE LAS TRES RAMAS DE LA DEFENSE NACIONAL Y EL SENOR GENERAL DIRECTOR DE CARABINEROS. LA JUNTA MILITAR HA ASUMIDO EL MANDO SUPREMO. RESPETANDO EXPRESAMENTE LAS ATRIBUCIONES DEL PODER JUDICIAL, CONTANDO CON LA ASESORIA DE LA CONTRALORIA GENERAL DE LA REPUBLICA Y DISPONIENDO EL RECESO DEL PARLAMENTO. DE ESTE MODO LA JUNTA CREE ENCONTRAR EL CAMINO ADECUADO PARA INSTAURAR LA INSTITUCIONALIDAD QUE SE REQUIERE. LAS RESERVAS QUE ESTA POSICION DE LA JUNTA PUEDAN INSPIRAR A CIERTOS SECTORES POLITICOS NO PUEDEN SER TAN ABSOLUTAS QUE LLEGUEN HASTA NEGAR EL CONCURSO DE TODOS LOS CHILENOS AL ESFUERZO DE RECONSTRUCCION DE SU PATRIA. POR EL CONTRARIO, A TRAVES DE LA JUNTA, ES CHILE MISMO. EL QUE JUEGA LA CARTA DEFINITIVA PARA TRIUNFAR DEL ODIO. DE LA DESUNION, DEL DESALIENTO Y DE LA DECADENCIA. LA LABOR IMPONE LA ACCION DE TODAS LAS CAPACIDADES Y LA COLABORACION DE TODA LA CUIDADANIA, ESPECIALMENTE DE AQUELLOS CHILENOS QUE POR SU INDIFERENTISMO, SU INDECISION, SU EGOISMO O SU PEREZA HAN GENERADO LAS CONDICIONES QUE PERMITIERON EL DESARROLLO DE LA IDEOLOGIA MARXISTA Y SU LLEGADA AL PODER EN 1970 GRACIAS A LA DIVISION DE LAS FUERZAS DEMOCRATICAS.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

SECRET

Elliff was also interested in knowing whether our legal attaches were operational in the counterintelligence field. He was advised they were not. Elliff also asked whether CIA made available to the FBI their latest technical developments. He was advised that we believed they did.

Finally, Elliff desired to know whether the FBI had received any documents from another Government agency (CIA) wherein the Bureau was requested to surreptitiously enter the Chilean Embassy in Washington, D. C.[^1] He was advised that this would have to be researched and that we would be in touch with him on this particular subject.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) We have already begun to examine the material asked for regarding the FBI's legal authority and implication of sensitive investigative techniques. Once examined and analyzed, we will submit recommendations as to how we should proceed taking into consideration the observations and suggestions of Elliff.

(2) We are pulling together the documents regarding the Chilean Embassy episode and with approval will suggest Elliff submit his specific request in writing through the AG.

Luis---I attempted to get a reaction from the analyst regarding the information in paragraph 2. Unfortur ely there is a new analyst for Honduras who is now away on vacation and he left no second who understands the situation in Honduras. So rather than held on to this report--I am returning with no response from the analyst.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE US citizen, executive of an import/export company with extensive business connections in Central America and the Caribbean. He makes frequent trips to these areas, and has contact with high ranking military and political leaders. He speaks Spanish fluently.

1.  The Government of Honduras (GOH) recently obtained a US$12 million loan from the Central American Bank of Economic Integration for the expansion of the Azucarera del Sur sugar mill located in Choluteca, Honduras. In addition, the GOH has purchased two sugar mills, one in Brazil and the other in Puerto Rico. The mills, bought at a cost of US$15 million each, will be dismantled and shipped to Honduras, where they will be reassembled with the aid of foreign technicians. Also, another sugar mill is to be built in the country at a cost of US$20 million; however, the Japanese Mitsubishi enterprise will be the major stockholder, while Honduran private businessmen will hold a minority interest. This is part of an expansion and modernization program by the GOH with hopes of obtaining a larger share of the world's sugar market.

2.  The GOH is somewhat concerned with the infiltration through Mexico and Guatemala of Communist agitators and guerrilla training personnel. These guerrillas, mostly Cubans who remained in the country after they had arrived allegedly to assist the GOH following Hurricane Fifi, are causing growing concern as a result of several uprisings and invasion of private lands by peasants in several parts of the country. The Cubans, who stayed in the country following Hurricane Fifi and others who have arrived clandestinely since that time, reportedly are training leftist militants and sympathizers among the Honduran peasants. The agitators and guerrilla instructors are taking advantage of growing unemployment and the overall poor national economic situation to stir the peasants into activity against the government.

SOURCE US citizen, executive of an import/export company with extensive business connections in Central America and the Caribbean. Ee makes important trips to these areas and has contact with high ranking military and political leaders. He speaks Spanish fluently.

1. The new military regime in Honduras currently is holding talks with Venezuela and hopes to sign an economic agreement in the very near future. With that a wind, the Government of Honduras (GOH) recently sent a high level commission to Venezuela headed by Captain Armando San Martin, Secretary of State for Economy and Commerce and by Attorney Antonio Jose Cuello to ivid discussions with high ranking Venezuelan Government officials. Prior to the talks, the GOH recently sold to Venezuela 25 million linear feet of lumber at a total cost of US$5 million. The GOH hopes to reach an agreement by which Venezuela would buy Honduran agricultural products for an unspecified mix of cash and petroleum products. In addition, Venezuela would support a new agri-cultural production plan to be implemented in the very near future by Fernando Montes, Honduran Secretary of State for Agriculture.

2. Despite reports that Chief Executive Colonel Juan Alberto Melgar Castro has unquestioned authority, Honduran military sources have indicated that Mario Maldonado, Agrarian Refora Chief; Lieutenant Colonel Mario Fonseca, Director of the Military Academy, and Lieutenant Colonel Juan Ramon Kolina Cisneros, Commander of the First Artillery Battalion are the real "power behind the throne." These officers, who profess a strong nationalist ideology, are interested simply in the general welfare of the Honduran people, and they are maintaining a "watchdog" attitude to insure that no one, especially people in positions of power, uses such positions for his own personal benefit. These officers are members of the National Defense Council (NDC), which also includes the commanders of all major military units in the country. Maldonado, Fonseca, and Molina appear to be the "first among equals" in the 15 member NDC.

DATE OF INFO. February 1975

PLACE & DATE ACQ. BY SOURCE Tegucigalpa/February 1975

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE US national, executive of an import-export company. He is a frequent traveler to Central and South America where he has developed good contacts in the political and business sectors. He speaks Spanish fluently.

1. Businessmen in Honduras have reported that the economic and political situation in the country, currently in a sad state of affairs, is bound to become worse as a result of the indifference being exhibited by President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano. On the economic side, the private business sector is quite concerned about an expected government move to nationalize the fishing industry. Some foreign firms already are pulling out of the country and moving to nearby countries like Nicaragua and El Salvador. On the political side, President Lopez has failed to name a permanent foreign minister since November 1974, when Cesar Batres occupied that post. Ricardo A. Pineda is performing those duties on an interim basis. The President also has undermined Honduran youth by giving in to the demands of the leftist-controlled labor unions. He gives businessmen the impression that he does not know much about government; consequently, the simation in the country has become very unstable.

2. Apparently, the regime in Honduras wants to emulate the current Peruvian Government in failing to even consider elections at all. In fact, the government, which is controlled by the military, has three pro-left ministers in the cabinet. They are Manuel Acosta Bonilla, Secretary of State for Finance; Guatama Fonseca Zuniga, Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security, and Manlio Martinez Cantor, Executive Secretary, Planning Board. At one time, Acosta was the private secretary of the Mexican leftist leaser Vicente Lombardo Toledano, so he has been thoroughly indoctrinated along Marxist lines.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen who has worked and lived in Honduras for a number of years. He has numerous social contacts and business connections with officials of the government, the Armed Forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1.  Horacio Moya Posas is the present director of Agrarian Reform in Honduras. He is inefficient and lacks some of the necessary qualifications for that position. In spite of his being a lawyer by profession, he is not astute, is only of average intelligence, is far from decisive, and frequently vacillates when called upon to make decisions. He is, however, extremely anti-Communist. His deputy director is Roberto Oliva. He is no asset. He has no outgoing personality whatsoever, and in fact, he is rather innocuous. One thing that can be said in his favor is that he is reported to be a good engineer.

2.  The previous Agrarian Reform director was Rigoberto Sandoval. He is an extremely capable lawyer, very sagacious, intelligent and he displayed great foresight in that position. His present and future course of life is worth observing closely because a possibility does exist that he may be a candidate for an important political position in the not too distant future. To date Sandoval has not mentioned which political position he plans to seek. Another reason for observing him is that he is exceedingly anti-US.

3.  If Sandoval does decide to seek a political office, it would most probably be General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who would sponsor him.

4.  Early in October 1972 a US importer-exporter received a very pleasant personal letter from Rigoberto Sandoval. By the tone of the letter one would judge that a close relationship has existed between them for some time. Sandoval stated that he was in Italy working for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and that for the present his stay there was for an indefinite period. He enclosed a long list of items which he requested the US importer-exporter to send to him immediately if at all possible. The list consisted mostly of furniture, household furnishings, electrical appliances, etc.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen who has worked and lived in Honduras for a number of years. He has numerous social contacts and business connections with officials of the government, the Armed Forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. Honduran merchants, industrialists and some of the people have been urging the revival of the Central American Common Market (CACH). To all intents and purposes it has been practically non-existent. Salvadorians and Guatemalans have also expressed the same desire.

2. In early October 1972, these urgings were taken into consideration by the Secretaryship of Central American Economic Integration (SIECA) (Secretaria Permanente de Integracion Economica Centro Americana). SIECA appointed a president, and a board of directors was selected. Eduardo Ortes Colindres, a Honduran lawyer was named president. General Somoza of Nicaragua and General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano approved the appointment of Eduardo Ortes Colindres so much that they offered to aid him in revitalizing the CACH. The board is composed of members from Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras. They are authorized to represent their countries in all matters pertaining to the CICM.

3. It is interesting to note that in spite of Honduras having informally retired from the CACM, not only is the president a Honduran, but so is the president of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE), with headquarters in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The fact that General Samoza of Nicaragua and General Lopez Arellano of Honduras have volunteered their assistance to Eduardo Ortes Colindres has led most of the Central Americans to believe that the CACH can once again be made active. If this does occur, it would indeed be most beneficial to the Central American countries concerned.

4. Labor is better organized in the northern part of Honduras than anywhere else in that country. It has a headquarters in every city where administrative activities are conducted and where seetings of union leaders are held. So far meetings have not taken place at work centers.

5. Transactions between labor and the government are carried out by labor delegates Celio Gonzalez, through the Ministry of Labor, never directly.

6. Labor, as such, does not subscribe to any one particular political party. The Marxist theories do not appear to appeal to Labor Unions. However, many of their members do seem to be leaning towards the Liberal Party.

7. On the surface Labor Unions' actions in Honduras appear to be demagogic at times. They make demands on the government, industry and businesses in spite of their knowing that their demands may prove to be harmful to the economy of their country. It would be rather unfair to always hold the Honduran Union Leaders responsible for this demagogism, because frequently the union members themselves are guilty of pressuring their leaders to execute some specific demand, even though they had already been warned of the possible haraful effects.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen, an engineer who has worked and lived in Honduras. Ee maintains contact with high ranking Honduran Government and business leaders and travels frequently to that country.

[This report was developed by an Arcy representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. I have recently had the opportunity to spend an evening with Rigoberto Sandoval, who as the General Secretary, Planification Board, is responsible for agrarian reform within the Republic of Honduras. He told me the following information:

2. Sandoval is making a trip to West Germany and poss bly other con-Communist European countries is an attempt to procure technical assistance, credit and other unspecified help for the Enduran agrarian reform program. He feels it is in the best interests of Honduras to turn to countries other than the US for assistance. He claimed the US is now in decline; that she is both unable and unwilling to fulfill her international obligations, particularly within Latin America, and that she is slow to react and bogged down with 'bureaucratic red toe. Sandoval also suspicions that the Peace Corps, initially very beneficial to Horduras, is a tool of the CIA.

3. Sandoval considers himself to be the enemy of foreign businesses, particularly American, as they are holding large amounts of property which should figure in the agrarian reform moverent. Ee did not mention plans to appropriate foreign land holdings however.

4. Sandoval has not heard President Osvaldo Lopez Arellano personally claim interest in another term. The feeling inside government circles is that Lopez will request a constitutional amendment permitting hin to remain in office for six core years without benefit of election. If this happens Sandoval will resign. Although Lopez is behind the agrarian reform program bis remaining in office would not be beneficial to the country.

## HEADQUARTERS COMMENTS

An excellent report. I am sure OCI vill
find it useful. It answers their questions.
Another reason that it appears that Lopez
plans to continue in office after 1971
is that he keeps the threat from E1
Salvador on a high key.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen who has worked and lived in Honduras for a number of years. He has numerous social contacts and business connections with officials of the government, the armed forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1.  President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano is interested in a second term. This opinion is based on a growing consensus among Congressmen, Honduran business leaders and the military that Lopez desires to remain in office for another term. The thinking in these Honduran circles is that the lack of disclaimers by Lopez is, in itself, a strong indication of his "continuismo" plans. Approximately ten days ago Herman Pascua, manager of the National Railroad, headquartered in San Pedro Sula, had a discussion with the President during which Pascua passed the remark that he would like to remain with the railroad as long as Lopez remained in office. Lopez made no specific rejoinder to this but Pascua left the President's office with the distinct impression that Lopez would run for reelection.

2.  Lopez would probably be reelected with relative ease. The opposition Liberal Party is divided internally and lacks both an effective candidate and the capital necessary to offer a serious challenge.

3.  The power and influence of Ricardo Zuniga has declined drastically in recent months. This is not due to any specific act but more to a growing realization by President Lopez of Zuniga's dishonesty, ambition for power and his inability to get along with some government officials and prominent military officers. President Lopez was particularly dismayed at Zuniga's handling of Honduran propaganda during the recent Honduran/El Salvadoran border war. Lopez allegedly felt that the invective against El Salvador often mirrored the type used by Cuban Communism.

4.  Miguel Andonie Fernandez, a self-appointed presidential candidate, is an honest, sincere and well respected man. There is a small group of roughly ten Arab and Jewish businessmen in San Pedro Sula known as the "economic mafia" because they control so much of Honduran business activity. This group has taken note of the candidacy of Fernandez and has been impressed by his honesty and sincerity. They will not support him however, because they feel he lacks the political experience and popular base for a successful campaign.

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen who worked and lived in Honduras for a number of ears. He has social and business contacts with officials of the government, the armed forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1.  For over five years I have been in close contact with Hondurans of different backgrounds and social position. Never before have I seen the anti-American sentiment which is sweeping Honduras at the present time. The feeling is not only evident among student and labor organizations, but among sectors of what is considered to be the best informed and educated individuals in the country. Most of them are convinced that the US has the influence to exert diplomatic presures on El Salvador in order to settle the pending border dispute, but has failed to do so. They see the US Government as favoring El Salvador.

2.  During conversations with several government officials they emphatically stated that Honduras was not going to open the Pan American Highway to Salvadoran traffic. This is the attitude of almost everybody that I talked with. This single issue has served to unite the country like never before. There is a new feeling of patriotism which was lacking before the conflict with El Salvador.

3.  The campaign against Salvadoran products has resulted in an incentive for Honduran investors. I have had several inquiries from Honduran businessmen who are interested in establishing production facilities for consumer articles which were normally imported from El Salvador. These individuals are eager to invest and establish factories in order to fill the demand for products which were imported from El Salvador.

4.  Honduras has been purchasing arms and ammunition from Portuguese and Belgian sources. Some of this armament has arrived in the country. According to a military informant most of the armament has not been delivered, but is expected in the country before the end of the year.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen who worked and lived in Honduras for a number of years.
He has social and business contacts with officials of the government, the
armed forces, and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of
preparation.]

1. During early August 1969 a close business associate met with Colonel (fnu)
   Coreccolli (phonetic) and members of the Honduran Army General Staff. Colonel
   Coreccolli and members of the Staff were alarmed by the continuing reports of
   arms and ammunition stockpiling by El Salvador. These individuals were of the
   opinion that the armament of the Honduran Armed Forces was inferior to that of
   El Salvador.

2. During the meeting Colonel Coreccolli inquired about the possibility of a legal
   or illegal purchase of approximately 2500 M-1 rifles and an undetermined amount
   of .30 caliber ammunition from US sources. He explained that the weapons were
   needed to arm personnel with prior military service in case of a renewal of
   hostilities with El Salvador. These individuals were considered to be a re-
   serve for the Honduran Armed Forces.

3. My associate explained to Colonel Coreccolli that under the circumstances the
   US Government would not issue an export permit for the armaments. As for il-
   legal sources my associate disclaimed knowledge of any. He also considered
   the transportation problem. Colonel Coreccolli stated that if acquired the
   weapons could be smuggled aboard a Honduran refrigeration ship which was an-
   chored in the Miami River at that time. Following this Colonel Coreccolli
   closed the meeting indicating that he was going to explore other possibilities.

4. Following the meeting my associate had a conversation with Rigoberto Sandoval,
   a member of the Planification Board. Upon being informed of the meeting, Sandoval
   warned my associate to be careful in any dealings with Colonel Coreccolli, since
   he was known as a corrupt government official, a "thief". Sandoval stated that
   this was the opinion of President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who distrusted Corec-
   colli. A few days later my associate learned that Ricardo Zuniga, Minister of
   the Presidency, has been given the task of purchasing arms and ammunition for
   Honduras.

5. Mauricio Hernandez, wealthy owner of a lumber mill in Honduras, visited the US
   during the first part of August 1969. He told me that he was going to purchase
   two "combat aircraft" for the Honduran Government. He did not specify the type
   nor the source of the aircraft. About a week later I had a telephone conver-
   sation with Hernandez, during which he told me that he had been "successtul" in
   his purchasing mission. He did rot give any details. - end -

SUBJECT: Alleged Dissatisfaction of Aurelio Trillo, Cuban Merchant Marine

FILE 03-4(c) 22/33118-63
4 November 1963

1. A contact of this office recently reported the information presented below.

2. I had a conversation with some relatives who arrived from Cuba during October 1963. During the course of the conversation I inquired on the whereabouts of Aurelio Trillo Huerta, a former close friend of my family. From my relatives I obtained the below information and impressions concerning Trillo and members of his family.

3. Trillo is the second or third officer aboard the MININT'S ship "La Plata". He is dissatisfied with the G-2. This dissatisfaction arises from the unjust imprisonment of his father, Aurelio Alonso Trillo de Fanafilo from September 1956 to October 1957. He was convicted for "counterrevolutionary activities" by the G-2. Subsequently his father was released and at the present time is in Mexico waiting for a visa to enter the US. During the time of his father's imprisonment Aurelio was planning to leave the island by clandestine means but was dissuaded by his family.

4. Trillo remains in the Merchant Marine because of the privileges obtained as an officer and because of the opportunity to travel. In his trips he acquires items which are scarce in Cuba and gives them as gifts to his family. Most of these gifts are then sold or bartered in the black market for foodstuffs and other necessities.

5. Trillo has two sisters who are married to Merchant Marine officers. Teresa Trillo Huerta is married to Alfredo Llanos Llanos. She is a government secretary who works in classified foreign trade activities. She has one child, four years old. Among her close relatives, she is openly anti-G-2. The other sister is Lilian Trillo Huerta. One of these Merchant Marine officers is a captain but I don't recall which one.

6. Aurelio Trillo is about 23 years of age, intelligent and an introvert. He is not married. Though it has been about nine years since I have seen him, from what my relatives told me I believe that Trillo would be willing to cooperate against the G-2. During the fourth week of October the "La Plata" was supposed to be at Bilbao, Spain undergoing repairs.

SOURCE Cuban national, an engineer who has worked and lived in Honduras for several years. During this time he has developed social and business contacts with officials of the government, the Armed Forces and the business community.

[This report vas developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. During the middle of January 1968 I had a lengthy conversation with Moises Lopez Valdonado, Honduran Consul in Costa Rica and a leading personality in the Partido Nacional (PJ). He is a very close friend of Martin Amero, leader of the Pli. Lopez spends about half of his time in Honduras. He is an intelligent and cunning politician with a lot of common sense. Ee is critical of the soft lines used by the US in internal and foreign affairs.

2. During our conversation he stated that the next President of the country would be a civilian. He doubted very much if the Armed Forces could come up with a suitable candidate. Ee gave his opinions about several individuals with presidential aspirations.

"Armando Velazquez Cerrato has completely disregarded the Party machinery. He is ambitious, but too individualistic. He has no political future in the country."

"Kanuel Acosta Bonilla present Kinister of Economy, is capable, a hard worker and a good man. His Presidential ambitions at the present tize are very subtle."

"Ricardo Zuniga is vell qualified and would have support from most of the influential people in the government who would like to see him as a Presidential candidate. A hard working individual, he is the right hand of President Lopez Arellano. I consider him the best qualified to run for the Presidential office."

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Cuban national, an engineer who has worked and lived in Honduras for the last two years. During this period he has developed contacts with officials in government, the Armed Forces and the business community.

[This report, was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. I have known Rigoberto Sandoval for approximately eight months. As the General Secretary of the Pianification Board he is a very capable and competent individual. He is progressive and liberal in his ideas, though at times seems to be inclined to the left. He is a man of great potential for the development of the country. Sandoval vas instrumental in instituting a housing project of approximately one thousand houses, to be constructed in San Pedro de Sula. The houses will be built for needy families. A loan of US$2 million has been granted by the "Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo" for the project.

2. The Minister of Economy, Manuel Acosta Bonilla, is an honest, hard working, and responsible individual. I have talked with him and with people who are close to him and got the impression that Acosta has no higher political aspirations. At least he does not show any outward signs of it.

3. Armando Velasquez Cerrato is being handled by the government very carefully. He is considered to be a dangerous individual. However, he is regarded by some of his followers as a scapegoat of the present government. Personally I don't think that he has any opportunities or enough popular support to intervene in the goverment successfully.

4. Ricardo Zuniga, Minister of Presidency, remains as an influential figure with President Lopez Arellano. Zuniga provides financial support to the non-Communist student organizations who support his claims that the US is intervening in Honduran internal affairs. In a recent confrontation with an official of the US Embassy, President Lopez Arellano openly supported Zuniga.

5. Since the last two years there has been a marked change in the country. There could have been more progress but the government is not dynamic enough, even though President Lopez Arellano is in complete control of the government. The opposition to the government is weak, plagued by differences of opinions, and lacking unity. The large majority of the people are undergoing great misery and poverty. Still, the masses are contented. Their interest is in subsisting from one day to the other, hot politics.

SOURCE Cuban national, an engineer, who has worked and lived in Honduras for the last two years. During this period he has developed social and business contacts with officials in the government, the armed forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. Negotiations are going on with Mexico for the establishment of a steel plant in Honduras. The principal force behind the establishment of this industry is (fnu) Alduvin, an engineer with the "Banco Central". Alduvin studied in Mexico, an is a very intelligent and capable person. Alduvin vas Minister of Public Works during the regime of Villeda Morales. At that time he vas a supporter of Brown and Root, a US company with offices in the country. Though Alduvin was instrumental in granting several important projects to the company he now criticizes it as another extension of "Yankee Imperialism".

2. A US firm, International Paper Company, has been selected as one of the major stockholders, with participation of ADELA and the Government of Honduras, for the establishment of the paper and pulp plant and for the exploitation of lumber reserves in the country. The paper and pulp plant is tentatively to be established at the junction of the Aguan and Mame rivers. The area selected by the government for the exploitation of lumber reserves covers approximately 15 thousand square kilometers in the departments of Olancho and Yoro. The government is going to face a problem trying to determine the ownership of property in the area. I estimate that it will take three years to survey the boundaries and to set land- marks in the area.

3. Two access roads will be constructed to serve the area. One, "Carretera del Projecto Forestal de Olancho", vill connect the paper plant with the forest reserves, extending from Mame to Salams, a total of 130 kilometers. The other road will connect the plant to the coast, from Mane to the port of La Ceiba, a total of 100 kilometers.

SOURCE Cuban national, an engineer, who has worked and lived in Honduras for the last two years. During this period he has developed social and business contacts with officials in government, the armed forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. The armed forces are doing a splendid job in their civic action projects. Their primary interest seems to be the construction and repair of roads throughout the Republic. In conversation with a liaison officer between the army and other government agencies he mentioned that the only difficulties they are facing in their programs is the lack of adequate equipment, and the lack of cooperation by the Public Works Office. He told me that in most instances the requests made by the army for the use of additional transportation or utilization of existing equipment are disregarded by minor officials. This creates problems requiring the action of higher officials, who are given the impression that the army is the originator of these problems.

2. Considering the available resources and facilities of the country the armed forces are well trained and disciplined. During the latter part of 1967 President Anastacio Somoza and a group of other Nicaraguan dignitaries visited Honduras. Several groups under Communist influence demonstrated against the visit. I had the opportunity to observe the development of the demonstration, from a meeting to a riot, from a vantage point. Despite the fact that the army riot control troops were stoned and abused they were disciplined enough to prevent what could have been a serious incident. They did not attack or fire at the mob, as would have been the desire of the leaders, who incidentally always remained behind the mob and utilized other people to direct and incite the demonstrators. The troops and junior officers who were present during the demonstration were highly praised by the responsible elements of the society.

3. If a guerrilla movement started I believe the armed forces would act swiftly. A special counter-guerrilla unit is well trained and equipped to prevent development of small units into large and organized guerrilla bands.

Two or three months ago I met three Cuban nationals, Jose de Jesus Flana,
Carlos Morris, and Eduardo Garcia, members of the "Confederacion Latino
Americana Cristiana", CLAC, with central offices in Caracas. These ind1
viduals travel through Latin America with the purpose of familiarizing
groups with Communist methods of operation and spreading democracy. I
talked several times with them, and with people who had attended their
meetings. It is my impression, as well as that of others, that they
tended to create the wrong impression. Several times they justified the
actions of Fidel Castro, and seemed to be anti-American in their line of
propaganda. Certainly they did not do anything worthwhile to aid democ-
racy. These individuals claimed not to have any association with the US,
and to receive financial support from Germany.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen who has worked and lived in Honduras for a number of years. He has numerous social contacts and business connections with officials of the government, the Armed Forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. The Honduran economy is in a deplorable state. Some young army officers are urging General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano to lead a coup d'etat to displace President Ramon Ernesto Cruz, and have offered to help him. Early in October 1972 a government official and several young army officers stated in a private conversation that Lopez Arellano did not believe it advisable for him to lead a coup d'etat until most of the following events took place:

a. A rally in the general economy of the country.

b. Improved diplomatic and commercial relations between Honduras and El Salvador. This improvement would further a better functioning of the Central American Common Market (CACM).

c. Completion of the Pan American Highway extending between El Salvador and Honduras. Completion would benefit both countries by giving access to new markets for their products.

d. Decreased corruption among government officials. Not only are some of them feathering their future nests with currency, but also permitting individuals to do likewise in return for something the government official desires the recipient to give or to do for him.

e. Enrichment of the Treasury so that funds could be made available for projects beneficial to the country and its people.

2.  During the same private conversation, General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano was quoted as having stated that it would be futile for him to lead a coup d'etat unless there was hope of improving the welfare of the masses and the general economy of the country as well; he firmly believes it would be impossible to accomplish that goal until a change in most of the above conditions were met prior to any coup d'etat in which he would be interested.

3.  Selected Honduran army officers have attended special courses at an army facility in Peru since approximately 1967. According to an army officer the number of candidates sent since early 1972 has not only been increased but also each has been ordered to specialize in any one of the branches of their choice. They previously attended the various courses given at that facility.

4.  The army gives an outward appearance of being in sympathy with the present regime, but in reality not all the members sympathize with President Cruz. In private conversations some speak of him in a derogatory manner, espec- ially young officers.

5.  A man who continues to wield a great deal of power in Honduras is Ricardo Zuniga Augustinus, Minister of Government and Justice, also leader of the Nationalist Party. Zuniga's ability to continue wielding power is due to his being a very clever, astute, wealthy man. He always knows exactly what he wants, and does not hesitate to utilize his personal character- istics and his wealth in obtaining his objectives.

6.  Zuniga's present ambition for continued power has forced him to feign being a firm constitutionalist. That is, he is claiming loud and clear that commitments made between the government and political parties must not only be respected but must also be adhered to. Zuniga does not clain this because he really believes this to be a moral obligation, or because he is a fervent democrat. The fundamental reason is that he knows he is the recognized leader of the Nationalist Party, as well as having become influential in the Liberal Party. He believes these parties are the ones sustaining the present regime of President Ramon Ernesto Cruz in power. Therefore, he calculates that through these two parties he can protract the power he has today.

7.  Today relations betwen General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano and Zuniga are not as cordial as they were previously. However, one must not be led to be- lieve that this situation is unrepairable because if Zuniga needed Lopez Arellano's help, or vice versa, the former pleasant r 'ationship would be hastily nursed back to life. It is just possible that if a coup d'etat led by General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano should take place, and be successful, Zuniga would make a great effort to settle any differences existing between them. This might not please some of the army officers who dislike Zuniga due to his character and the procedures used by him to obtain power.

8.  Up to the present time the Armed Forces do not appear to be leaning towards the "left". They are naturally desirous of improving their way of life. The Air Force has recently organized a company whose entire net profits will go to the Air Force for the benefit of its members. General Osvaldo Lopez Arellano is investing in various industries and small private industries. He has very recently established a company called Empacadora de Carnes (meat packing firm) whose net profits will be for himself alone. The Armed Forces hold General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano in the highest esteem. This knowledge is based on his observations and personal contact with officers and enlisted men.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. My work takes me to the rural areas in Honduras where I have opportunity to talk with the peasants. It is my considered opinion, based on personal observations, that the peasants in the rural areas are bitter and disgusted with their lot. They have little or no faith left in anyone. Economically, their condition is second only to Haiti, in comparison with the countries in the Caribbean. The prices of staples compare with prices in the US, but Honduran wages are far below US wages. Unemployment is a very grave problem. My company hires unskilled labor but does not need more than 200. We have had to refuse hundreds who applied because we had no need for them. A small fraction of those turned back will be able to find work, the rest will remain unemployed.

2. There is little economic development in the country and almost complete lack of initiative and vigor. Seldom is a man found in Government or industry who is not afflicted with the two major vices among this segment of the population: wine and women. The economic inactivity at times appears to be the result of indifference, other times the result of intentional delays by Communist infiltrators in Government. As an example of this "lack of initiative" I will make reference to the road in the Olancho area. The loan for this 110 kilometers of road was approved in October 1963. The road is badly needed to move agricultural products from this region, to provide employment for hundreds of needy people, and to provide the only access for the construction of a US$ 20 million pulp and paper plant in the area. Until the summer of 1967, these funds remained idle. Preliminary studies were not even made. With luck, construction may commence in 1963, but by this time payments on the principal and interest are due to start.

SOURCE Cuban national, an engineer, who has worked and lived in Honduras for the past two years. During this period he has developed social and business contacts with officials in government, the Armed Forces and the business community.

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.)

1.  Ricardo Zuniga, Ministry of Presidency, is the hardest working man in the Hondurza Government. Ee enjoys his liquor as well as amy other official in government, and when he goes on a drinking spree it may last for days. However, he has a great capacity for work and lately he has cut down on his drinking. He is too intent in his presidential aspirations. President Lopez Arellano has left the administration of government to Ricardo Zuniga. Zuniga's trusted man is Lucas Lozano Zelaya, Procurador General (Attorney General).

2.  There are two others who have designs on the presidency, Mario Rivera Lopez, President of Congress, and Colonel Armando Velescez Cerrato, Honduren Ambassador to Mexico. Rivera Lopez' chances are very small, but Colonel Velasquez is a very serious contender. Bota Zuniga and Lopez Arellano are fully aware of his strength. Even though Colonel Cerrato has publicly denied that be is behind the pro-Cerrato committees being formed within the National Party, I am informed that he is in fact supporting them.

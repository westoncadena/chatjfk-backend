MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT : Compromise of Cover

1.  As a result of information obtained from reliable sources who served in Vietnam, we have established that the former Staff personnel listed on the attachment should be presumed to have been compromised as CIA employees to the North Vietnam Intelligence Service as of April 1975. We presume also that the identifications of these individuals as CIA employees were passed by the North Vietnamese to the Soviets.

2.  Although the personnel listed in the attachment are no longer employed by CIA, nevertheless, I suggest that their official personnel records should be documented concerning the possible past compromise of their cover.

3.  Please coordinate any action connected with this memorandum with Chief, CCS; Chief, CMG; and Chief, CI Staff.

Conein was in U.S. military from September 1941 through September 1961, and on detail to OSS, SSU, CIG, and CIA to time of military retirement.

He was picked up as a civilian and as a career agent on 12 November 1961 and retired on disability on 15 July 1968.

Archenhold advised that subject claims military service as indicated above and that the only period to be certified is the period as a civilian, November '61 to July '62. This all we know about what Conein told DEA.

Remarks: Luke Conein has applied for employment with the Drug Enforcement Agency. The Acting D/Pers asked for the attached info from CIA.

Sent to D/Pers for signature. Conein was very controversial, much in the news about the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem and has been mentioned by Howard Hunt in Hunt's recent hearing before "Watergate" committee. Dick Biladeau, Central Cover, affirms that Conein is "opened up".

28 September 1973

Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug coordinators with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E. Conein, whose name has appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached memorandum is what Archenhold wants.

Conein's service was verified with ROB; his "honorable service" was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I discussed the case with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had opened up Conein last year and Biladeau approved release of the information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Department investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being considered as a consultant for BNDD.

Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA.

## NBC Claims
Diem Death
Inside Story

Soreaten Generala and
colonels of the South Viet
namese Army voted unani
mously to kill President 'Ngo
Dinh Diem in 1963, and were
not particularly discouraged
by hight: ranking. US
CIA Official, an NBC report
scheduled to be telecast to
night discloses

The report is Part 3 of "An
NBC News White Paper: Viet
nam - Hindsight - and deals
with the origins of America's
Involvement in that Southeast
Asia country.

The report presents the first
supposed inside: account of
Diem's assassination, disguised
as a political, roup, and in
cludes statements by Alvin
Davis, associate producer of
the program, and Lt. Col. Lu
elen Conein, the key CIA man
in South Vietnam during the
time of the coup.

It is "quite inconceivable",
to Conein that Gen. Maxwell
Taylor and others were not
aware of the timing of the
coup, Conein says on the pro
gram, which depicts Diem's
death as a Diem maneuver,
that, backfired.

The decision to kill Diem
is reported to have developed
over a series of eight meet
ings and arguments, and, fi
nally, a vote. Three who would
have voted to save Diem were
assassinated before the vote
was taken. Four others in
cluding the present Prime
Minister, Khirim, were delib
erately excluded from the vote
among the 17. Sou.
mer, wanted him killed from
the start and the only over
heard phrase spoken in French
rather than in Vietnamese was
by Big Minh, might have been
presidential contender in the
October 1971, election. said
Lord, "the tug must be killed."

After that, the vote went
like this: Big Minh: kill; Gen
Don: kill; Gen Xuan, kill; Col.
Nghia, kill. At the end there
was total unanimity, and a vow
of silence was taken. The si
lence is to be broken tonight,
Davis says.

Diem had asked for full
honors, and a "graceful" exit
from Vietnam to exile in an
other country, but refused to.
was furious at the slight.
Between 6 and 9 p.m. Nov. 2
the day of Diem's death, he
refused again to speak to
Minh, then finally spoke to
him on the telephone, but
Minh, outraged, hung up. On
the third try. Diem gave in,
asking only for safe conduct.

At this point Col. Conein
said he was told by Ambas
sador Henry Cabot Lodge not
to instigate, encourage or dis
courage a coup, which was in
the planning stages through
out October, 1963. But Diem,
Conein said, had his own plans,
for a phony coup, after which
he and his family would be
brought in honors, by popular
acclaim, back to Saigon from
their place of exile, Pleiku.

What happened, apparently,
is that both the phony coup
and the real one came off at
the same time, fooling Diem
and his brother, Ngo Dinh
Nhu.

Conein, in an attempt to get
Diem out of the country says
he asked his embassy for a
plane, but was told that he,
would have to wait 24 hours
for it.

"I spoke for the U.S. gov
ernment and I was authorized
and I informed the junta
(Diem's organizations) that
had an aircraft, but it would
take me 24 hours to have that
aircraft on the ground."

"Instead," Davis asked

"Instead, he was shot by a
major in the Vietnamese
army," Conein says on the
Telecast

# DEPARTMENT OF STATE
WASHINGTON

AUG 9 1965

Dear Admiral :

The purpose of this letter is to request your concurrence in the reimbursement to the Department of State of the following personnel:

Joseph F. Baker

These officers will serve in Washington for a tour of duty of 13 months. Their detail to the Department will be for a period not to exceed 2½ months. During this period the Department will reimburse the Agency, upon presentation of appropriate billing, at the officer's rate of salary, plus retirement and insurance costs, and such differentials and allowances to which they may be entitled. In addition, the Department will reimburse the Agency for travel, per diem, and other expenses incident to their travel and transportation.

In view of the high priority of the program in which these men will participate, it would be appreciated if the Agency could arrange for their detail to begin on or within the next 30 days. With several men coming from Saigon, early action is desirable to complete the orientation of the men.

If you see no reason why you cannot agree to this request, please so indicate at the bottom of the duplicate copy of this letter. I appreciate your cooperation in making the services of these officers available to us.

Sincerely yours,

Leonard Unger

Deputy Assistant Secretary

## LANGUAGE TRAINING OBJECTIVES AND METHODS

The general aims of language training are attainment of proficiency in speaking, understanding, reading and writing. The specific objectives are (1) ability to produce and distinguish the sounds of the language; (2) ability to use a stock of basic sentences and expressions: (3) ability to recombine the elements of basic sentences and cx- pressions and to apply them to new situations; (4) ability to comprehend the language spoken at normal speed in vari- ous situations: (5) ability to write and read the language commensurate with ability to speak.

Methods used in all courses stress oral drills and free conversation based at first on memorized material and, at a later stage, en varied reading materials, written and oral tests are given at Intervals. Listening to and re- cording on tapes in the Language Lab is essential for class preparation.

This officer is personally acquainted with almost every senior official or officer in the Vietnamese Government and armed forces, and with a significant number of these this acquaintanceship amounts to close personal friendships extending back over a number of years. These associations have given this officer truly unique access to senior echelons of Vietnamese leadership, and he has exploited this access effectively and to great value to the Station. He has had long experience in this area, and uses his understanding of it to great effect. He works very well independently and has shown considerable initiative. He balks at no assignment, and carries out all assignments without regard for his personal convenience, safety, or well being. In the field of written expression this officer's performance falls somewhat short, but he has made strenuous efforts to improve in this sector with some success. All in all, he is an imaginative and dedicated officer who can be counted on to discharge his duties with high effectiveness and total personal commitment. It has been a pleasure to have had him at the Station.

Subject is a virtual walking encyclopedia on the history, customs and senior personalities of Vietnam. He has been associated with this area on and off over the period of the last 10 years. During this time he has developed lasting friendships with many individuals who are now in high positions of power within the government. These contacts are of considerable importance to the Station in its intelligence appreciation of the situation and in the coordination of operational activities on a discreet basis with those high personalities. At the personal request of the Prime Minister he has become senior advisor to the Prime Minister's personal protection force and has, in fact, formed and trained this force from scratch. He is a highly motivated and dedicated officer to whom considerations of personal convenience and safety are always second to his determination to achieve whatever mission is given to him.

On the negative side, his written and oral presentation, while showing some improvement over the previous report, still needs additional improvement. He has no supervisory responsibilities at the present time and therefore is not rated on that score. He exhibits a good sense of cost consciousness in utilization of man power, materiel and funds.

Only his difficulty in expressing himself in writing prevents this officer from being rated "Outstanding". He is a calm and detached professional who at the same time is intimately caught up in his work and in the many important contacts he has on the local scene. His very valuable role could not be performed by anyone else at this Station, nor to my knowledge, by anyone else in the organization at the present time. He is a highly valued member of the Station.

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personal action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Subject is one of the outstanding American exports on current day Vietnam. He has lived and traveled in the area for a number of years and has continued a study of the area while absent from it. Many of the current senior officers up to the general staff level were formerly Subject's subordinates and regard him as a friend and colleague whom they trust and in whom they will confide. This relationship of trust and friendship fortunately also exists with the Minister of Interior who is the forth or fifth leading personality in the government. Subject was formerly a senior officer in the U.S. Special Forces and by virtue of his qualifications and experience in this field has been of considerable value to this Station in the extensive programs it has undertaken in concert with that command. He is additionally a skilled clandestine operator with a thorough grounding in technique and a wide and colorful background of experience. Subject's ability to express himself in writing, while adequate, can stand improvement. He is evidently sincerely attempting to remedy this and some progress is noticeable. Overall, Subject is a distinct asset to the Station and we are particularly pleased to have him. Subject is a career agent and an amendment of his contract to reflect a promotion to the next higher equivalent grade is recommended. It is likewise recommended that he be promoted from the USAR reserve rank of Lt. Col. to Col. in order to increase his prestige in negotiations on behalf of the COB.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL I concur in the rating given above to Subject who has proved himself invaluable to the Station and to the front office in terms of his thorough knowledge of the Vietnamese scene, of Vietnamese personalities, and of the many issues involved here. I have personally leaned heavily on his judgment and advice. Our high appraisal of Subject is shared by the Ambassador and by the Deputy Chief of Mission. I have found that Subject works in a discipline manner and functions cooperatively with other members of the station. He has made very definite progress as a staff officer and in applying himself to the paper work which goes with that responsibility. I personally initiated the recommendation that Subject be promoted in Agency grade as well as in U.S.Army rank, mentioned in Section C. above.

Chief of Station, Vietnam

Commendation of Arthur R. SCHWICKRATH

1. Forwarded under separate cover is a commendation from General Langdale for SCHWICKRATH.

2. I though you would be interested in seeing it sinco it is a good indicator of how much of the General's reporting- can be believed. Notice particularly the paragraph on page 2 concerning SCHWICKRATH'S "services to my staff...in an applied field of philology, particularly in Vietnamese oral linguistics and the working of official documents..." When this paragraph was shown to SCHWICKRATH, he gave vent to somo very soldierly language, pointing out that he doesn't speak a word of Vietnamese nor can he read it.

1.  It is requested that Arthur R.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestine Services Personnel Division

ATTENTION : Agent Panel

SUBJECT : Deletion of Arthur R. SCHWICKRATH from Project IUJEWEL roster.

1. Arthur R. SCHWICKRATH has been employed as a Career Agent in Project IUJEWEL since 16 October 1961. During that period he was assigned to the Saigon Station as a Staff Advisor on Paramilitary matters to the Chief of Station.

2. When at the termination of that assignment, SCHWICKRATH returned to Headquarters, it was assumed by SOD that he would return to SOD and be again covered by Project IUJEWEL. However, I now understand that SCHWICKRATH is being processed for an assignment in WH Division and is, in fact, engaged in language training for that assignment.

3. In view of the foregoing, it is requested that the name of Arthur R. SCHWICKRATH be removed from the Project IUJEWEL personnel assets.

SUBJECT: Promotion

REFERENCE: Fitness Report dated 25 Feb. 1963

1. In view of present and past Fitness Reports, and by comparison with other ZRJEWEL personnel, I believe that the promotion of to GS-14 equivalent is justified, and that it would be in order to convey this view to FE/Personnel. Technically, however, the administration of (and decision to promote) is a responsibility of FE Division until reverts to SOD under ZRJEWEL.

2. I would strongly recommend against any move to request Army to advance's retired status from Lt. Col. to Col.; although, for operational purposes while he is at Saigon it might be possible to give him notional or "assimilated" rank.

1.  FE/Pers will not honor promotion recommendation to GS-11. equiv. until field sends in a specific recommendation. This is the way FE Operates. FE Division feels [redacted] is their employee until his tour in Saigon is completed. If SOD wants to take action re the fitness report recommendation, Mr. Jorgerson should discuss this with Paul Breitwiser.

2.  FF/Per advised the field by [redacted] "personal note" from Mary Boulger that promotion from Lt. Col. to Col. is not possible. SOD/Pers advised by FE/Pers that Department of Defense turned down active duty status, [redacted] for cover purposes because in addition to being a retired reservist, [redacted] departed for the field under Department of Army Civilian cover and was arrived to Saigon in that capacity. After his arrival it was determined [redacted] in the field that he would represent himself as military. This was never sanctioned by headquarters.

5. IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN STRICT PERSONAL SECURITY FOR SCHWICKRATH. HE IS KNOWN TO MANY VIETNAMESE BOTH IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS HAVING BEEN ENGAGED IN VARIOUS INTELLI-GENCE ACTIVITIES IN VIETNAM SINCE 1945. IN ADDITION, THE STATION HAS JUDGED THAT HIS BEST UTILIZATION HAS BEEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CHIEF OF STATION IN VARIOUS COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND LIAISONS WHERE IT WAS NECESSARY HE DE IDENTIFIED AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COS. IT WOULD BE BOTH IMPOSSIBLE AND COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE IN SCHWICKRATH'S CASE TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE COMPLETELY HIS AFFILIATION WITH KUBARK.

6. DURING HIS CURRENT TOUR, SCHWICKRATH HAS ACQUIRED IN-CREASING SKILL AND FAMILIARITY IN THE INTRICACIES OF KUBARK STAFF WORK, BOTH AT THE INTER-STATION LEVEL AND THE INTGA-MISSION LEVEL. THIS IS A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS MERETOFORE BEEN KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER. SCHWICKRATH HAS PER-FORMED THESE NEW DUTIES WITH CONSIDERABLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY RAPID BUILDUP OF PARAMILITARY ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT SCHWICKRATH WAS THE ONLY STATION REPRESENTATIVE IN A RECENT CONFERENCE CONVOKED BY CINCPAC IN HAWAII TO RECOMMEND PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT INVOLVING A YEAR-LONG TURNOVER OF CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO MACV. SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON-FERENCE'S ADOPTING ALL STJIVON RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT TO ITS FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES. AT THE SAME TIME SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KUBARK, CINCPAC AND MACV.

7. I HAVE PERSONALLY FOUND SCHWICKRATH TO BE AN INVALUABLE MEMBER OF OUR STAFF WITH AN INDISPENSABLE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND ON SOUTH VIETNAM AND ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO GUERRILLA WARFARE. IT IS A DISTINCT PLEASURE TO HAVE HIM WORKING HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE STATION.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FE Division

SUBJECT: Employment of Lou Conein.

1. At my request, General Lansdale has quietly checked on the status of Lou Conein's retirement from the Army. He is presently in Iran and is slated for return home and retirement in August. He has made an effort to return sooner but the Iranian Government protested that it would be an act of bad faith (apparently, he is doing a good job with them).

2. At the moment, Conein belongs to ACSI and Lansdale feels that any move on our part to accelerate his return would be misinterpreted, or perhaps I should say correctly interpreted, by ACSI, I am getting his address and will establish contact with him by personal letter. Lansdale feels that Conein is very anxious to come back to work for the Agency.

Since I have been in the military service since September 1941 and since the majority of my military service has been in overseas areas, specifically since1959, 1961, and since I have just returned from Teheran, Iran, my social contacts are not in the United States.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: CONEIN, Lucien - Major

On 27 June 1955, Major Conein returned to Washington, D. C., after serving one year PCS at Saigon, Vietnam, where he was with the Saigon Military Mission under MAAG cover as Major, U.S.Army. Upon Major Conein's return it was decided that since no replacement had been found for him it would be necessary for him to return to Baigon under the same cover arrangements he used for his PCS, for a period of TDY. Major Conein wan informed by CFE/4/Support end VWN/Support Officer that CIA travel orders were being prepared authorizing him only 90 days TDY in Baigon. These orders were signed by C.V.Hullek, DDP/EXO, CFE, LCB, MPD, FE/CFI, CFI, and FE/BF. At the conclusion of the 90 days IDY no replacement had been found for Major Conein and he remained in Saigon. No amendment to his travel order won submitted however, no extension by cable from Headquarters

WAS BAR to Ind Lat Mater were ros.

Uopa checking with MPD it was found that Major Concin, if he remained in the field for even one year's 'IDY, would receive the maximam per diem rate as prescribed by FIR's ($20 per day lens 1/5 for quarters which were being furnished) and that this per diem rate could not be reduced. ACFE/4, ACFE/4/VN, and VN/Support Officer discussed the entire case and since Major Conein had been informed prior to hin departure that he would remain in Saigon on TDY for 90 days only, a Formm-52 was submitted reaseinging Major Conein to a PCS status in Sagon, Vietnam effective 27 October 1955 (30 days after his TDY started). An amendment to the original travel order was submitted to show the change from TDY to FCS effective 21 Oct.

SPECIFIC Assignment of [REDACTED] and VILLIERS

DATE DISPATCH NO.

REF: a. SAIO 2922
b. DIR 49205

1. Headquarters appreciates SLADE's reply to Ref b, and will make it a matter for the record. For SLADE's (and VILLIER's) information [REDACTED] has, in the course of his duties in Europe, come to the Attention of the French, probably including the UNION organization. Naturally, his former KUTWIN record is well-known to UNION and he is personally acquainted, we have since learned, with TUTOR himself.

2. Headquarters appreciates, too, the probable reaction of TUTOR to the advent in the Indochina scene of VILLIERS, [REDACTED] and possibly other with similar histories. This is unavoidable and unfortunate; however, under the circumstances Headquarters considers their assignment a necessary risk.

3. In a [REDACTED] that, in the [REDACTED] was assigned to [REDACTED] by ODISEX as a [REDACTED] had actually been released back to ODISEX, and [REDACTED] reassigned by ODISEX. As late dispatch is being written, those ODISEX orders are in process of being rescinded and new orders are being initiated assigning [REDACTED] to CA[REDACTED].

4. In the case of VILLIERS, whose orders have just been received transferring him to Saigon, if indeed his previous KUBARK connection is known to TUTOR, it can only be stated that he, too, has been released back to ODUNIT, at their or ODFARL's request, in response to their urgent need for an experienced senior officer with his qualifications for a special mission in Indochina.

5. This movement of personnel from one agency to another is by no means an unheard-of thing. As you are aware, as in the case of French service officers assigned to the to the TUTOR ORG, so are selected military personnel assigned to KUBARK. Very recently two senior ODIBEX officers on the KUHOOK Senior Staff were released at ODIBEX request by KUBARK and subsequently transferred to ODTOWN, Thailand, with no further KUBARK connection.

6. In spite of sincere protestations and denials on your part, we realize of course that at least some bit of suspicion will linger on in TUTOR's mind and that these suspicions will not be allayed by even the most circumspect of routine contacts between persons in VILLIER's group and members of the SIM Staff. Such contacts are bound to occur, particularly if the VILLIERS group does indeed succeed in getting an IMLARCADE program of any sort in motion. However, as we have stated, this is an accepted tisk, and we have to play the yume out, even though we cannot aзвезв the possible damage to the SIM liaison.

Lucent Conein

11 December 1953

Dear Dick,

You will recall that it was my intention in 1951 to civilianise and assume a staff position upon my return from Germany. Since my return last August, however, I have decided to return to the Army and, accordingly, I signed a statement of category to this effect on 1 December 1953.

This decision is in no way a reflection on you or members of your staff but rather recognition that I cannot afford to civilianize due to my personal obligations. I intend to inform John Richardson of my action at the same time you receive this letter.

Since I am at present holding a slot, I think it is only fair to all concerned to have it filled by a qualified person before my departure.

I want to thank you and Gordon for the trust you have given me in the past. You may rest assured that I will always to glad to be of service to the agency in the military if the need should ever arise,

Yours truly,

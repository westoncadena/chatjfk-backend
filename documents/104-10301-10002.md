available to SR/CI/Research on that particular sub-
ject. Some of these studies were sterilized sub-
sequently for passage to a wider list of recipients
than the sensitivity of the original production
permitted. Some studies were translated and given
to foreign liaison services.* Many of these studies
were the result of suggestions for research topics
from other SR Division offices, CIA-wide components,
and organizations outside the CIA.
Throughout the period of this history, SR/-
Reports, in coordination with Chief,SR/CI, had re-
sponsibility for the dissemination of timely general
CI reports on the RIS. The area division concerned
disseminated CI reports on the RIS which were clearly
of only local significance.

J. Warren Commission Studies

The President's Commission on the Assassina-
tion of President Kennedy, also known as the Warren
Commission, through its General Counsel, Mr. J. Lee
Rankin, frequently called upon the CIA for information

in 1964. SR/CI/Research Branch responded to many of these requests for information working through CI Staff which assumed managerial control for CIA communications with the commission. The branch furnished information to the commission on a wide variety of topics concerning the RIS, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald's associates in the USSR.*

In a meeting between CIA representatives and Messrs. Allen Dulles and Rankin of the Warren Commission on 14 January 1964, Rankin asked that CIA draft questions to be included in a letter to the Soviet Government concerning the Oswald case. The questions were to be "not too technical," should be sent soon, and were to be phrased in generalities in order to allow the Soviets more flexibility than would a longer, more pointed letter based on concrete US Government findings. These questions constituted the first direct involvement of Wigren and his Research Branch in the commission's work.

The commission wished to account in detail for all of Oswald's activities outside the United

States. Bagley, Chief, SR/CI, subsequently di-
rected Wigren to begin a chronological tabulation
of Oswald's activities in the USSR as collated
from various sources. The commission made avail-
able to Wigren documents and reports already ac-
quired from other US Government investigative
agencies. The commission agreed in principle to
honor CIA sensitivity classifications to documents
originated in the Agency for use of the commission.
The Agency's role was limited to written communica-
tions to the commission.[^1]

By 21 January 1964 Wigren and his colleages
had prepared and transmitted the questions to the
commission for relay to the Soviet Government.
Soviet defector Petr Deryabin had contributed to
this endeavor. The questionnaire had four basic
parts. The first series of questions sought to
make an assessment of Oswald's mental and physical
condition. The Soviets were requested to furnish
information on his medical treatment in the USSR
while in the hospital following his suicide at-
tempt in 1959 as well as any psychological evalua-
tions of him. The second series of questions

sought to assess Oswald's use of and dependence on
weapons. He had owned a shotgun in the USSR and
had joined a hunting organization there. The
third series of questions sought to complete Warren
Commission documentation of Oswald's background and
career in the USSR. Those items particularly
sought were his correspondence with the Soviet Gov-
ernment, Soviet Government documents issued to him
concerning his request for asylum and permission
to reside in the USSR, documents and registrations
of his residence and employment in the USSR, and
documents concerning his departure from the USSR.
The final question asked whether Oswald had a police
record in the USSR and requested information and
documents if so. [^1]

A comprehensive SR/CI/Research paper on the
Oswald case went to the commission on 25 January
1964. This was a detailed chronology of Oswald's
sojourn in the USSR together with an alphabetical
listing of persons in the USSR whom the Oswalds
knew or mentioned. Identifying information was in-
cluded whenever available. This chronology was in
preliminary form but the commission urgently required

collated material to support the taking of direct testimony. The source material for the chronology included personal documents, interviews, and official and private correspondence. Traces were based on CIA files and the Moscow and Minsk telephone directories. These preliminary name traces were also sent to the commission on the same day as the chron-
[^1]ology. The final version of the name traces based on a review of the Oswald papers came to over 150 names; the results were furnished to the commission in late March 1964.
[^2]

SR/CI/Research prepared for the commission at its request a paper survey of known data on Soviet use of assassination. This study was intended only for background information of commission members with the caveat that CIA as an organization did not believe that the Kennedy assassination was a Soviet-sponsored operation. Much of the material in the assassination study had been published previously within the Agency.
[^3]

A fortuitous aspect of the SR/CI/Research concerning the Oswald case occurred when Mr. Alexander W. Brasko of the branch discovered by accident

a photograph of Oswald in Graphics Register in March 1964. Brasko was seeking photographs of buildings in Minsk, USSR, where Oswald was resettled by the Soviet Government after 1959. Brasko found a copy of a color transparency which showed in a casual setting a young man who bore a remarkable facial resemblance to Oswald and was wearing a shirt identical in pattern and color to a shirt Oswald was wearing in photographs found in his effects following the Kennedy assassination. (Figure 1, page 77). The photograph was taken by an American tourist in Minsk's Central Square in August 1961 at the Palace of Culture. Copies of the photograph were also furnished to the FBI. The Bureau interviewed the photographer and her companions who could contribute little to their original statements when first interviewed by Agency representatives following their Soviet tour in 1961 (not about Oswald, however, whom they did not recall). A copy of this photograph was published on page 268 of the Warren Commission's report.

Some of the reports prepared by SR/CI/Research were deemed suitable for publication in the Commission's

report in the public record, either as textual material or as footnotes backing up general comments. This required explicit permission from the DDP, and the rewriting or declassification of some material previously submitted to the commission. In August 1964 Warren Commission Assistant Counsel W. David Slawson requested permission to publish in the commission report some memorandums submitted to the commission by SR/CI/Research via CI Staff. Since some of the material submitted to the commission earlier was intended for background use only or contained operational information, the reports in question were resubmitted to the commission in sanitized versions modeled on the originals. The revisions were identified as coming from CIA and appeared primarily in textual and footnote material on pages 258 to 280 of the commission's report.*

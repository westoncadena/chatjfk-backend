FROM: Chief of Station, Buenos Aires

SUBJECT: RYBAT/REDTOP/DIOGENESIS/AFROOR - Surveillance Reports

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

Reference: HABA-20512, dated 25 April 1969

1.  Reference dispatch described our efforts against AEBOOR and stated that the next phase would consist of a 24 hour a day surveillance of Subject for a period of about two weeks. The coverage was initiated at 0600 hours on 19 May, and terminated at 1515 hours on 26 May, the day of AEBOOR's departure for home leave.

2.  The overall results of the surveillance effort were interesting, and provided us with a great deal of basic data which should prove valuable in futuro AEBOOR operational planning. Although the period covered must be viewed as somewhat atypical since it covered a time of preparation for homo leave, the basic pattern could not have varied greatly from the norm. There was definite evasive action designed to shake surveillance taken by AEBOOR on several occasions; there were repeat visits to several establishments which could easily serve as lottor drops or con- tact points; and there was an interesting contact on 21 May (reported in BUENOS AIRES 3009) with an individual we failed to identify positively.

3.  Although the above makes it appear that we are approaching -the-AXBOOR peration strictly from the CI/CE angle, this is not the case. We are attempting to gather adequate information to give us a clear insight into AEBOOR's activities in order to holp us attempt to introduce an access agent into this operation, or to expand direct development of Subject by Station officers.

4.  Forwarded under separate cover for Headquarters study are copies of the surveillance roports along with a copy of the AFLANYARD transoript for 21 May.

REDTOP/AEXICK/AEBOOR
Operational Possibilitios against ABBOOR

Reference: IICSW 7666, 11 February 1969

1. With the departure of AEBOOR and his wife on home leave, wo would like to offer a fow comments about him for possiblu future action by the Station when he returns. The impetus for these thoughts was a recent examination of the files of H'l those Soviets on the priority target Adst to determine if, perhaps, one of thom offers more of a potential for intonsive development than another. The purpose of this review was not to discard the agreed-upon targo list, since this list is the rationale behind the entire concept of selective targetting; but rather, to attempt a narrowing of the Station's focus on the one particular Soviet who appears to be the best selection for operational devolopment among the priority group. We have looked at such factors as susceptibilities (known or potontial), contacts, accessibility, etc. and, for reasons discussed below, fool that AEBOOR may be the best selection for a dotermined Station offort aimed at his eventual recruitment. Thus, the Station's focus on the other priority Soviets would continue at its prosent lovel but at the same time, AliBOOR would be placed "under the microscopo" as the object of a more intonsive Station offort aimed as gaining multiple accoss to him.

2. With the imminent departure of BIBANDIT/12 from Buenos Airoo and the resulting elimination of our one good contact with ABVULTURD, the choice of ANBOOR became casior to make. His saloccion, however, was based on several considerations which, from our vantage point, soon to offer the best potential for Station action when he returns to the country.

a. Acceasibility: AEBOOR is one of the very few Soviets with whom direct Statfor contact has been made. The social ovening spone with him and his wife in January showed excellunt preniso because it appeared that foundations for rapport and Jurther contact had been laid. We note, however, that thero has been no moncion further moetings since the initial one, four end one-half months ago. Due to the olapsed time, wo assume that Subiect and his wife are not planning to rociprocato the Invitations on ve other hand, enough time will have pass since the initial contact for the Station to take the initiativo

again and instigate a second meeting soon after Subject returns from home leave. Since there are no other access agents now in touch with Subject, the potential for assessment of our target personality by direct Staffer contact becomes crucial in the selective targotting procedure. Through the advantages of direct assessment, we should be able to make a good judgment concerning the suscepibilities (or lack thereof) of ALBOOR and accordingly, determine the value in pursuing him as a priority target.

b. The impressions of AEBOOR and his wife from the one meeting thusfar seem to offer some possible avenues of approach which the Station may wish to consider in their planning. The wife, in particular, was described as being more relaxed than ABBOOR and through her professed interest in theatre, music, and ballet, it might be possible for Nina T. MARGANDE to exploit this interest and invite her to selected cultural events. If ALBOOR does not share his wife's proclivitios for the "arts", then she might appreciate the presence of a fomale comnanton who shares her interests. AbBOOR's wife also claimed to like both American songs and dancing. This too, might open the door to some form of imaginative approach built around a future invitation whereby the incipient social relationship of 9 January would be further developed in the depth needed for a thorough assessment of the target. Cultivation of the wife appears to be particularly appropriate because of the apparent conflicts and tensions between her and her husband. The accounts of this relationship from thar previous tour in Mexico and also the current transcripts from ABLANYARD paint a picture of an irascible and foul-mouthed husband constantly doing battle with a domineering wife. It seems likely that the impression of "sweetness and light" which, they generated during their evening with the Station case officers was atypical and manufactured for the benefit of their hosts. This, of course, is natural with most couples who choose not to air their personal differences in public, but from our point of view, this lack of harmony between ABBOOR and his wife offers distinct possibilities for the Station to contact the wife independentiy and offer her welcome diversions from the regimented and turbulent life with her husband. (We call your attention to the reference since it may provide some useful points in devising an approach to ABBOOR's wife). Their present home leave in the USSR would seen to offer a ready-made situation for renewed contact when they return since natural curiosity about their activities and time spent at home could be sufficient grounds for an invitation either to both or singly to spend an evening together. We offer those thoughts only because they appear to us as good opportunities not only to maintain Staffor contact with a target of priority interest, but to also develop this contact further to the degree of intimacy nooded for a recognition and ultimatic exploitation of his susceptibilities.

6. Since there are no access agents now in touch with AKBOOR, we suggest, as a supplement to the direct Staffor contact and in order to obtain additional assessments of Subject from other angles, the Station consider "running" a controlled anset into ALBOOR under suitably contrived circumstances. In other words, we would crente a relationship where none pre-viously existed. By this device, we are not suggesting a double agent operation in which our agent offers himself for recruit-monts on the contrary, the rationale is simply to move a controlled asset into the path of the target and attempt to estabilan a contact through a common bond of social or business Interests. If we agree that ABBOOK can be brought uudus a 2050 intensive scrutiny than the other soviets, then this ploy would be a logical stop in his development as a recruitment target if additional access to him is non-existent.

d. AVDEPTH: The ability to monitor AEBOOR through this technical operation was a key factor in deciding to bring him under closer focus. it should be able to provide the necessary depth to any human assessment of the target and it gives us the singular opportunity to "observe" AEBOOR when he is relaxed at home and not exhibiting the official mannerisms and personality which he must display in public and around his other Soviet colleagues. If we are able to expand the burgeoning Staffer contact with Subject as well as place access agents in touch with him, then his reactions to these contacts can be monitored and our moves against him tailored accordingly.

3. As part of the total effort to build up a large amount of information on the selected target, we are including as an attachment, a copy of the new Personality Characteristic Questionnaire (PCQ) with instructions for its use. lly employing it in conjunction with your direct assessment of ALBOOR, we should be able to slowly build up onough information on him so that the indirect psychological assessment techniquécan also be applied. The PCQ is a now form and less time-consuming than others but we believe it should be an integral part of the entire assessment process focused on a target Soviet and that it can bo an invaluable aid in attempting to evaluate the varied impressions of the target which have been obtained from multiple access to him. An initial review of the PCQ may give the impression that many of the questions are irrelevant and have no bearing on the determination of a persons susceptibility to manipulation. The questionnaire should not be perused piecemeal, however, but taken in its entirety since each portion will be interpreted and weighted by the indirect psychological cal assessment techniques until a very complete impression of the total personality emerges. We encourage the Station to wailise the PCQ and when sufficiently complete, forward it to Headquarters for evaluation.

4. Once again, we wish to emphasize that lleadquarters is in a position to offer guidance and support to your efforts, but the direction of the case rests with the Station. The case officer involved is in the best spot to fudge the progress of the case and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, we encourage a continuous end candid dialogue, concerning the various aspects of your operations against the selected Soviet targets in order to insure professional development of each case. If our choice of ABBOOR is ag variance with your on-the-spot assessment of the priority Soviets, thon we would appreciate your appraisal of him as well as any suggestions about a more logical candidate for closer focus.

A. Ivan (ALFERYEV)

B. Rosa (ALFERYEV)

C. Anatoliy Ilich (VASILYEV)

((Readability is very poor. Music is playing very loudly.))

A., B., and C. continue their conversation. ((Reel 4))

They talk about clothing and dinner jackets. C. says he does not own a dinner jacket, and adds, "But according to regulations, I...

By official government regulations, a counselor is provided/allowed ((to have a dinner jacket)). I'll tell you, there are some people who think I don't know this. They keep quiet about it... but I'm embarrassed to say..." B. comments, "You should have one made, and that's all." C. says that when he needed a dinner jacket, he talked to the Ambassador about it. He adda, "Concerning the dinner jacket, he ((the Ambassador)) said, 'Drive over; you have... well, get it from ALFERYEV. That's an Ambassador!' ((Short portion unreadable.))

B. remarks, "Anatoliy Ilich, he ((probably the Ambassador)) is a strange man."

They continue talking about dinner jackets. A. says that some diplomats at other embassies also do not have dinner jackets. He says to C., "Why don't you ask the French Ambassador if he has a tail coat..." 0. comments, "What a comparison!" A. continues, "By the way, they rent ((tail coats))... Ask the French counsel if he owns a dinner jacket..." C. states, "And you go ahead and ask how much they pay an ambassador -- $500, $1.000.

I know they get (20) ((a high salary))." ((Portion unreadable; all talk at once.)) A. says, "He doesn't have one; they rent ((evening clothes.))" C. disagrees, "No, Ivan; you're wrong. That doesn't bother me." A. says, "I realise that." C. explains, "This is a matter of representation ((diplomacy)). If a man has such a difficult, such a difficult... but I know that (XG)." ((Portion unreadable; all talk simultaneously.))

A. insists, "Everybody rents ((evening clothes)); everybody rents." C. exclaims, "But I'm supposed to have it ((a dinner jacket)) according to the regulations. It's written, it's written. Why should I rent it. If you wish, I'll let you read it ((the regulation)).'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

A. and C. try to convince each other on the pro and con of renting
a dinner jacket.

C. expresses his indignation about the situation and tells
of his conversation with the Ambassador about a dinner jacket when
they were due to attend a function: "I told him... if I find a
dinner jacket... So, you will go ((alone)). You have one. But
he asked me, 'But why don't you have one?' I said, 'Yuriy Ivanovich,
you yourself know why I don't have one.' He shut up..." Later,
B. agrees, "You should have your own ((dinner jacket)).

C. continues to be resentful, and says, "But the man ((unclear who,
possibly the Ambassador)) is jealous, so that, I don't know...
that some sort of (?crooked - krivoy?) counselor will have a
dinner jacket. I... ((B. laughs)) I spit on you..." ((probably
referring to a supposed critic)). C. adds that he frequently says
that "if a dinner jacket is required, I will not go."

The three have a drink. ((short pause)) They discuss
music, and talk about an orchestra which they heard on TV. They
comment on tickets which they have received for various concerts.
((Readability is very poor: the TV covers their conversation.))
They talk about theatrical artists, the Bolshoi Theatre, and an
orchestra. Mention is made of DURMAYEVSKIY, the composer, and
various records. ((Loud music covers their conversation.))
They talk about OYSTRAKH and OSTROPOVICH. B. flirts a bit with
A. and C. All laugh frequently.

Farther, B. changes the subject and speaks irritably about
her work. She asks A., "Was my work at the Embassy normal, was it
normal?" A. states, "It was normal." B. retorts, "Oh... it was
normal. Yes, ((sarcastically)) it was normal. I did not (so)
normally when I was sitting in (Pavlovich's?) ((not otherwise
identified)) office. (20). And I'll tell anyone you please that
it ((the work)) was not normal." A.'s brief comment is unprintable.

B. insists angrily, "I'll say it myself. And I won't ask (to).
I know whom to tell. I'll definitely say it." A. calls her
"a fool!" B. rebukes him, "The word 'fool' is always at the tip
of your tongue; 'fool,' 'fool.' All evening, all evening."
A. states, "That's the first time I said it." B. rants, "So, you said
it for the first time! Really? You only said it once?"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

C. attempts to sooth B., "Well, Ivan didn't want to say anything bad. I'm sure of that... It isn't that... It concerns some sort of... ((All talk at once -- unreadable)) A. states, "This is none of your business (4G) and I'm not planning to." B. shouts, "Right, so don't put/seat me where you shouldn't -- in the bathroom!" ((figuratively speaking)). C. interrupts, "Rosa, Rosochka, what are you saying!" B. yells, "Well..." C. continues, "Well, Rosa... Rous, sometimen..." B. retorts sarcastically, "It's none of my business -- that's the main thing!" C. says, "Ivan is sometime incorrect/unjust in his attitude toward you ((plural)) but you ((the informal "ty")) understand how difficult it becomes for married (3G) ((possibly moaning "officials")), Roza. Rozochka, you shouldn't... you should work some more/longer..." A. repeats to B., "It's none of your business." C. adds, "You shouldn't be that way... Later everything will be better." A. remarks, "She's not satisfied..." C. continues, "Because we/you have to maneuvre somehow. Even if we were wrong, even if we were 100% wrong, you still have to wait. For you to see that we are wrong (1-20). Why is he wrong? Perhaps we are wrong, but there was some sort of precondition/reason for it. It's impossible for us to be wrong. According to his/our character, persuasion, (16)... desire... Do you understand what happens, Rozoohka?" A. states, "Do you understand, when they announce ((unknown what)) to them, they have not deserved that. It's always that way... In order to cast asperions on someone, it is absolutely necessary (2-30)..." B. protests, "((Even)) if (fan accusation?) is unjust? All right ((But if)) something is well done... ((express)) some gratitude, if you please..." C. comments, "Rozochka, don't you see, then the whole thing is that we then (10)." B. retorts, "At least he could have said that they were (?accusing?) me unjustly. At least he could have said..." C. says, "Roza! But here (20), do you understand, (XG) no such attention is given. For him here, you understand, (10). He is not alone here. A number of people are there, this one and that one ((colloquial: the fifth and the tenth))... And then perhaps someone... Especially a wife. That becomes most sensitive/painful. She is sort of the most sincere/frank person. But I wouldn't do it that way. There you are. And she will be correct. However, she did not see the one and the other person

((the fifth and the tenth person))... and immediately did not (2C)...

It's good at times. My Lord, Galka does that. At times I feel hurt ((but)) I won't say (2G). I won't begin saying it. Sometimes I feel so hurt that (XG)." B. tells C., "Anatoliy Ilich, when everything will be clean, when everything will be put in order, then I/you/we can talk about gratitude. But now?... There's chaos all around! And you talk about gratitude... ((She sounds incensed))

Everywhere there is (1G)." C. tries to convince her, "Roza! You shouldn't talk now. Do you understand? It has to be done gradually. After all, there is some sort of restraint/forbearance; there's a line... you have to (10). Roza! How much more/longer will we (10). er all, we haven't been together merely for one day. Take Ivan. (50) there are a minimum of 6 to 7 of us men in the Bureau. What I'm saying is that we must respect each other. We think, we discuss. We might make mistakes in something. But, nevertheless, 7 of us men won't be too mistaken as would be someone at (30). And then, a woman will sometimes not see/understand, Rozochka. (XO). Rosa, you shouldn't insult/hurt us that much. We have nerves and they (XG)." A.'s comment is unreadable.

B. tells her husband, "Sit, sit, all right!" C. continues trying to convince B. that she shouldn't insult her husband.

A bit further, B. tells C. irritably, "He piles everything on me. You're blaming me, right?" C. continues telling B. to treat her husband better, and says, "I love my Galka very much, and I see that Ivan loves ((you)). I am firmly convinced of that."

B. laughs sarcastically. O. adds, "(XG) that means to indulge ((your husband)). Rosa, how can you do that?" C. continues, "what do you want to do -- do you want to see/think of your husband as a scoundrel?" B. replies, "(26) in ((his)) attitude toward his wife." O. adds, "Or that I should be a scoundrel? I won't be one. If Galka would throw me out, I wouldn't become a scoundrel any way. I spit on that. No matter what anybody says about me, I won't become a scoundrel any way. And I won't be led by the nose by any Nina MEDVEDEVA." ((Apparently, C. believes that MEDVEDEVA bosses her husband.))

B. remarks, "I'm talking about (This attitude?) toward his wife." O. states, "And I'm saying that they are scoundrels."

B. continues, "... personal attitude..."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

C. states decisively, "They ((the MEDVEDEVS)) are scoundrels... Ivan, you shouldn't receive ((or, have anything to do with)) them. On the contrary, you should stay further away from them someplace, as far away as possible." C. continues lecturing B. about changing her attitude toward her husband.

Further, C. tells B. about an incident which occurred where the MEDVEDEVs were involved, saying that the MEDVEDEVs had been given ingredients to make meat pastries (piroshki), and that they had not made the meat pastries but had said that the ingredients had spoiled. He asks B., "How could those people do that? What happened to the ingredients? Roza! You have to Answer! Please answer!" B. asks, "I should answer?! Let them answer!" C. says, "Aha... But they don't want to ((answer))." B. asks, "Why should I answer?" C. insists, "Go ahead... answer! What happened to them. How did they..." B. says, "I defend them!" C. continues, "What happened to the ingredients? Please answer. They... someone else, if you please... Why? Did they take them ((drive them)) someplace? They volunteered to make them. What happened ((to the ingredients)). How did they spoil? When did they spoil? What spoiled? And where did they drive to? Answer that question. And (?automatically?) they twisted everything around. Do you know what I'm leading up to? And what happened later?" A.'s comment is unreadable. B. states categorically, "Ivan will twist anything around..." C.'s comment unreadable. B. reports, "... he'll twist anything..." C. asks, "And then what about (10)?" A. says, "This is the very best example..." B. asks, "What did you say...?!" A. says something unreadable. B. asks, "Why do you ascribe things to me that I did not say? By the way, your manner has long since been noticed... has long since been noticed..." C. tries to interrupt her, but she continues, "... you can blame a person for something he did not say, and you will keep on insisting that he said that you (30) me." A.'s remark is unreadable. B. says, "... a good relationship. He ((MEDVEDEV)) has a very fine relationship/attitude toward his wife." Farther, C. asks, "What kind of relationship is that? If I did such a thing, Galka would give me such a lecture... if I permitted such a thing, did such a thing, she would not live with me. She would never permit me to do such a thing -- never would she look ((at me)) if I


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

would be able to do anything so vile." Referring to B.'s statement
about the good relationship between the MEDVEDEVS, C. says, "How
can you say that, how can you give such an example? ((He mimics
B. sarcastically)) 'They have such ((a good relationship));
everything is done by them in a friendly manner.' ((C. says
maliciously)) Roza, I despise them..." He continues expressing
his indignation. He adds, "They have a foursome; the first are
the MEDVEDEVS and then, the TEREKHOVS ((the four are good friends))."
C. says that "yesterday I spoke with Galya BOLDINOVA ((probably
about the MEDVEDEVS and the foul up on the meat pastries))."

The three of them then calm down, converse quietly, and
have a drink. The music covers a part of their conversation.
Theylisten to the music and make intermittent commonts.

Later, A. begins picking on B. and says to O., "She doesn't
think. She has been in a huff all evening. Instond of thinking,
she..." 0. interrupts, "Vanya, don't talk that way. ((He changes
the topic)) Where do you want to go ((take a trip, or trive))?
Well, Rosochka..." B. yells, "Well, when I get rid of you...!
May I state my conclusion/decision, or not? Will that minute ever
arrive, or not?" C. tries to calm her, "Rosochkn..." B. continues
yelling, "It's absolutely impossible..." C. and B. talk
simultaneously -- unreadable. B. then says, "Anatoliy Ilich, that's
correct. After you've talked with him, you leave. But for me
this goes on with him eternally, from morning to evening, and
during the night. It's absolutely frichtening!" C. again tries
so calm her down. B. goan on, "Why should I wait to say what I
want to. I way what I please." O. interrupts, "Rosa, Rozochka,
Rosa! But all of this is..." B. adds, "He has a malicious soul..."

REDTOP/AKTARGET

Telephone Tap Operations Against AKEOR and 201-025485.

ACTION REQUIRED: REFERENCES

1. As part of our continuing effort to effectively "bore in" on selected FJSTWALER targets, we requested BIOGENESIS to set up telephone taps on phones located in the apartments of AKEOR and 201-025485. BIOGENESIS complied, and the tap on AKEOR's line became effective on 18 April. Coverage of 201-035485's line went into effect on 22 April.

2. Although we do not expect this coverage to provide us with dramatic results or some sort of "break through", we hope that it will contribute significantly to our overall coverage of these two targets.

3. Once these operations have been in existence for a reasonable period of time, we will advise Headquarters of the results.

1. Even though we have maintained AELANYARD for a considerable length of time, we have not been able to establish a pattern of activity for AEBOOR. The cause of this lack is quite simple: AELANYARD has been maintained more or less on a working hour schedule, 1.0., from roughly 0800 to 2200 hours with occasional additional night monitoring. Realizing this, wo decided to carry out a two week operation whereby we used different equipment. We will cease this phase of the operation since we now have, we believe, sufficient coverage to establish the pattern of activity of AEBOOR.

2. The operation has proved very helpful. We now know that on two occasions AEBOOR did not return home until five or six in the morning. Mrs. AEBOOR on one occasion launched into him comanding to know where he had beon, etc. His reply was "I have been working" and nothing more. We forward under separate cover a copy of the pertinent transcript involved in this discussion.

3. Our next step against AEBOOR is to mount via BIBAFFLE 24 hour surveillance of AEBCOR. It is our present thought to continue this for up to two weeks; however, since as many as 12 officers per day will be needed, the BIBAFFLEs will be hard put to carry it out. Other operations will have to suffer since we are convinced that woll conducted and thorough surveillance could produce

A. agrees. B. comes into the room and greets C. very graciously, telling him that they have been waiting for him. Everyone talks at once, joking and laughing. A. calls B. "Rozochka."
A short portion of the conversation is unreadable because the record player is on as well as a Spanish-language radio program.

B. hasn't calmed down/angrily says to her husband, "Everything is falling apart. But you're livin' in a government-raid-apartment. Everything: in fallin: part.

SUBJECT:
RYBAT REDTOP BIOGENESIS AELANYARD

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:
Reference: HABA-20357, dated 13 March 1969

1. Transmitted under separate cover for your information are copies of the AELANYARD transcripts from 3 February through 20 March 1969. Since Matthew F. CHETUNG worked exclusively on AEDANGLE-2 during this period, the material being forwarded is comprised entirely of Spanish language transcripts processed by BIOGENESIS transcribers. It is probably representative of the product we shall receive from this operation after CHETUNG's departure.

2. Although we have reviewed this material rather carefully, we have found little hard information therein. From the circumstances and the tenor of the conversations, we conclude that the wife of 201-236701 and the wives of 201-087550, 201-820310 and possibly 201-025485 are friends. From the transcript of 26 February we have extracted the information on 201-236701's T.V. repairman and will suggest that the BIBAFFLE team do at least an initial check. Otherwise, we are confronted with tantalizing fragments which appear to be significant but defy any attempt to read meaning into them. The pages are filled with namos of individuals that we have not been able to identify, exceptions being those of officials presently or formerly stationed in Argentina. (From experience with BILOCULAR and other BIOGENESIS transcripts, we feel that some of these names escapo recognition simply because they are so garbled.)

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

3.  In the coming months Buenos Aires Station plans to examine and assess the AELANYARD transcripts with care in an effort to decide whether they truly are worth the great amount of time now devoted to their review by Station officers. It is our present feeling that alternative, hopefully more productive operations against 201-236701 should be considered unless we and/or the BIOGENESIS transcribers develop a greater facility for putting the product into a more meaningful context.

4.  We should appreciate receiving any comments or ideas Headquarters may have on the separate cover material.

O ALFERYEV Contact with Lev YASHIN (201-

1.  Forwarded under separate cover for your information is a copy of a BILOCULAR report of 8 January describing a conversation between Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV and Soccer Player Lev YASHIN (DPOB; 22 October 1929, Moscow, Passport 331422). YASHIN and the rest of the Moscow Dynamo team had just arrived at Ezeiza Airport on Varig Flight 845 from Rio and were departing for Santiago on SAS Flight 955 after a layover in Argentina of three and one half hours. The team was on a Latin American tour covering Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.

2.  During the conversation KGB officer ALFERYEV and YASHIN, whom we believe is KGB, show that they are fairly close friends. They also mention mutual friends: Ivan Semenovich ARKHIPENKO (201-731434), a suspect KGB officer formerly stationed in Argentina; and Vitaliy Borisovich SHUBIN, the former Consul/KGB officer in Chile.

1. Forwarded under separate cover for your information is a copy of a BILOCULAR report of 8 January describing a conversation between: Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV and Soccer player Lev YASHIN (DPOB: 22 October 1929, Lascow, Passport 331422). YASHIN and the rest of the Moscow Dynamo team had just arrived at Ezeiza Airport on Varig Flight 865 from Rio and were departing for Santiago on SAS Flight 985 after a layover in Argentina of three and one half hours. The team was on a latin American tour covering Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.

2. During the conversation KGB officer ALFERYEV and YASHIN, whom we believe in KGB, show that they are fairly close friends. They also mention mutual friends: Ivan Semenovich АНИПІРЕНКО (201-731434), a suspect KGB officer formerly stationed in Argentina; and Vitaliy Borisovich MUDIN, the former Consul/KGB officer in Chile.

Chief of Station, Buenos Aires

SUBJECT:
REDTOP/Operational Evening with 201-236101 and Wife

1.  After many months of contact and many promises to "get together" some evening, Paul W. LEVERONE received a firm promise from 201-236071 that he and his wife would drop by for a drink and a snack on 9 January 1969. The promise became a reality, and the report of the evening's activities is forwarded under separate cover.

2.  Although no firm date for a future meeting was set, every effort will be made to continue social development of Subject.

# SECRET

1. Subject arrived at 1930 learing a Russian record as a gift from his wife and a bottle of vodka with a jar of caviar as a gift from himself. He apologized that his wife could not make it that evening because she had to attend a "command performance". Although Subject claims to be under a doctor's care for problems with his stomach and legs (blood pressure problems) and is supposed to avoid use of alcohol or four months, he did accept a drink (Scotch) and then proceeded to chat about various inconsequential topics. At about 2000 MARGANDE dropped in and a general conversation ensued. LEVERONE offered to prepare some Shashlik and Subject stated that it was one of the favorite dishes of his wife. He suggested that perhaps he could pick her up after the "commmand performance" and bring her to the apartment. This was readily agreed to but since there was an hour and a half remaining before Subject could fetch his wife, we continued with general conversation. The followide points concerning Subject's past activity came to light.

a. Subject stated that he had spent some time in Argentina in 1958 and that during this time he had had a chance to travel freely and see something of the country. The pouple were friendlier, politer and less hurried then. He did not go into detail as to what he was doing in Argentina but it appears to have been an official visit.

b. Klo "high point" was Mexico and les fondest memories are of his time spent there. He claims that he was able to travel over the entire country and got to know it better than his own. He also had various close friends in the journalistic field including several Americano (sic). In Mexico he was a PRAVDA correspondent.

c. Subject alee stated he had been in Ecundor for an unopooified Length of time during the month when the annual Indian flouta is held. tio claimed to like the place very much and described at length the Indian practice of wolling all their produce at the fair and then sponding the money on liquor.

d. Wien Subject was ready to leave Mexico ho applied for a transit vinm to the United States. When Ita inauance wan dolayod for some time, hu asked the American officials concerned if there wure

## SECRET

any specific problems regarding the visa or if it was being withheld simply because he was a Soviet. If the latter were the case, he said he would raise the question with the President of the United States (who was visiting Mexico at the time and was going to hold a press conference). Subject claims that as a result of this threat the visa was issued almost immediately. Due to completely fortuitous circumstances, Subject and three other Soviet correspondents met in New York on the 4th of July. LNERGO allegedly became excited about the presence of four Soviet correspondents in New York at one time and carried on a very tight surveillance which was quite annoying. During this time the notes compiled for books on Latin America were stolen from Subject and as a result his literary ambitions have not boun realized.

e. Subject stated that he has a 14-year old son in Moscow and although they miss the boy, there are no adequate schools in Argentina. This is the reason for the separation. In Mexico the Soviet Embassy has provision for the three primary grades. That is where Subject's son started his schooling.

2. At 2130 hours Subject left topick up his wife saying he would be back in about 40 minutes. This was fine since it gave MARGANDE and LEVERONE time to get everything prepared for the meal. At 2230 hours Subject called to say they were "on the way" and would be over shortly. At 2315 they arrived at LEVERONE's apartment.

3. A general four-way conversation continued during which Subject'o-and his wife's comments ran au follows:

a. Their son in Moscow is studying English and speaks it rather well. He also keeps fish in a 175-liter fish tank. Subjent wAN unable to recall the sort of fish in question.

b. There was a rather lengthy commentary in the system of sunding single people abroad for assignment to embassies. Subject's wife was very surprised that the Americans would send single men and women abroad since this was very "dangerous". She stated that the Soviets occasionally send a single girl to a foreign post but the implication was very strong that she was "well chaperoned".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

### SECRET

c. They were both interested in the linguistic abilities of individuals assigned to the American Embassy and stated that the Americans were often sent abroad with virtually no knowledge of the language whereas the Soviets were always well trained. (Subject's wife managed to get this point across in her halting Spanish and with assistance from her husband whom she kept asking for the Spanish equivalent of Russian words.) Subject did state that the Soviet language training system was not the greatest and seemed to give a point to the U.S. system when MARGANDE said that she had learned her Spanish from tapes and instruction.

d. Subject and his wife agreed that Buenos Aires is a large, dirty, indifferent city. They talked with nostalgia about their Moscow apartment which was only a ten-minute drive from lovely forests and streams where "a person could really relax". They mentioned that they had a quinta to which they retired on weekends but that the Quinta was noisy and full of mosquitos. (MARGANDE and Subject's wife agreed that *Raid* and *Off* were the most important purchases in Buenos Aires in the summertime.)

3. Conversation and listening to music continued until about 0200 hours (with Subject's wife oohing and auhing over American songs and arrangements). The evening was friendly and relaxed and there was no attempt to get into deeper political or ideological discussions since the primary purpose was to establish rapport and pave the way for future meetings.

4. Given below are MARGANDE's and LEVERONE's impressions of Subject and wife:

Subject: Although Subject at times gives the impression of being a rather simple fellow, this effect is created more by his apparent non-aggressive attitude than by actual evaluation of his intelligence. He appears to be au courant of the general situation in Argentina andits assessment of world situations and incidents seems to be quite logical and unbiased. It might even be suggested that Subjent is not overly influenced by Soviet official stande concerning certain specific topics. Unlike 201-183943, he does not go about spouting a very obvious party line, Subject presente a pleasant appearance, dresses well (he had on a clean shirti), and is generally an attractive

individual with a fairly good ser.se of humor. He appears to understand a
fair amount of English but it is hard to judge his speaking ability since
he seems to te reluctant to talk at length in the language. He also appears
to know some Georgian, He claims to know the Soviet Union west of the Urals

part of the country. From his comments and from observation it can be
asowned that he enjoys Mexican and modern American records and perhaps
even prefers them to the new, socially conscious Soviet music. His
one detracting mannerism is a heavy and constant blink.

**Subject's wife:** Subject's wife is also attractive and has a warm
personality. She dresses well and is interested in theater, music and
ballot. She enjoys going to the Colon but thinks the ballet at the Dolahey
is much better. She claims to enjoy dancing and apparently does not drink
very much. Her Spanish is halting but adequate to make horself uwderstood.

**Their Relationship:** Subject and his wife appear to be a coupio wiw,
if not in love, have grown used to each other and each other's ways.
Despite reports and direct evidence of their squabbling, it would be
dangerous to assume that this constitutes a weakness or domestic problema
They appear to rely upon each other and complement each other in social
situations to the point where a deeper understanding hetween them can be
assumed. (An interest occurence was the wife's flat declaration that
the Soviet Union was rapidly becoming a matriarchal society. Subject agreed
with a smile.) Although Subject does not take open issue with his wife
on topics whore he may not be in complete accord, he manages to get his
point across with a joke and a smile. All in all, Subject and his wife
appear to be two that could take part successfully in any social gathering.
MARGANDE thinks they are a "fun couple."

SUBJECT O REDTOP/AKLANYARD/Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV (201-236071)

1. It has come to our attention through AELANYARD thụt
   Ivan Gavrilovich ALFEIYEV (201-236071), a known KGB officer,
   may have traveled to Uruguay during the first days of Hovember.
   This suspicion is taend on the fact that Subject informed his
   wife he had to take a trip to Uruguay and then was not seen
   in Buenos Aires on the following Saturday and Sunday, the
   2nd and 3rd on November. Although we have been unable to
   find any record of travel or any request for permission to
   travel on his part, we cannot discount the possibility of
   his having traveled under false documentation.

2. Forwarded herewith is a photograph of Subject for
   your files. Buenos Aires Station will continue to monitor
   Subject's activities. If it appears that he is planning a
   trip to Uruguay, Montevideo Station will be notified inmedi-
   ately, and some coordinated motion can be taken to try and
   determine his contacts and activities while he is in Uruguay.

Subject appears to be quite hen-pecked. His wife constantly mimics him, tells him what to do and how to dis do it, finds fault with him for no apparent reason. She is over-be ring - doesn't give Subject a chance to answer her rhetorical questions before blasting him with accusations of never listening to her good advice.

On 30 October 1968 Subject mentioned that he would have to be going to Uruguay. There is no verification of his having made the trip.

## INTRODUCTION

1. As pointed out in Reference A we had hoped to mount an audio operation against 201-230071's (an identified ARKICK officer) apartment when his predecessor departed K*. Be failed in our initial attempt and bad decided to wait until 201-230071 left the city for a vacation or a business trip. On 21 May 1968 ve learned (via BILOCULAR) that 301-233071 we seeking a new apartment. BIBAFFLE promptly identified the real estate agent (IENTITY A) гesponsible for the apartment and on 23 Hay ealisted his cooperation.

2. With the aid of IDENTITY A, BIOGERNE18-14 and other DIRAFFLE Agents entered the target apartment and usdwtook a thorough casing and made photographe. After cousaltation with the Station, a precice technical plan we worked eat.

## HA 14-19,735

1.  Having gained assured access, the problem of a suitable LP presented itself. A quick check of the occupants in the same building disclosed that the occupant directly above the target apartment was a military colleague (IDENTITY D) of BIOGENESIS-66 (the BIBAFFLE chief). Contact was established immediately and although IDENTITY D was willing to help, he had already rented the apartment to another and could not renege. He agreed however to hold it one more month and to grant the BIHAFFLE tools necessary before he turned it over to the new occupant.

2.  While still seeking a suitable LP, the BIBAFFLE team went ahead and installed six mikes (two sonheiner “peter” mikes-3000 Ohms-in each room, thus creating a binoral installation). The holes were drilled from the floor above to the ceiling of the target apartment. Once the installation was completed, the target apartment was entered (BL-140071 and photographs were to be forwarded then under separate cover as Attachment M).

3.  After considerable searching, a suitable LP was located at IDENTITY I which was for rent. After consultation with BIOGENESIS-46, an agreement was reached whereby BIBAFFLE-18 (one of the Station's unilateral assets) would rent the apartment and serve as LP monitor. The apartment was rented by BIBAFFLE-18 on 1 July 1963.

4.  The running of the wire from the apartment above the target to the LP was delayed due to DICOMAND10-14’s other priority tasking and by a shortage of suitable cable (we obtained the cable from Headquarters). This final phase of the operation was completed on 7 August 1963. The distance between the target and the LP is 500 feet. The LP will be equipped by three dummy source tape recorders provided by Headquarters.

EXPLOITATION

5.  We are just now beginning to receive the tape from this operation. The tapes go directly to us from the LP and Matthew F. Cartwright processes them. The Spanish language portion, which we assume will be light, will be processed by BIBAFFLE.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES
REF: BUENOS AIRES 9897, 30 January 68

1. Forwarded herewith is a draft Soviet Personality Report, Supplement, and Characterization on Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV (201-236701), known KGB officer of the Fifth Department (Latin America), First Chief Directorate (Foreign Intelligence), who served as *Pravda* correspondent in Mexico City from September 1960 to October 1964. Although the draft is not in polished form it is Headquarters feeling that it represents an accurate summary of Subject's 201 file. Headquarters traces were made on Subject's contacts and included in the attached Supplement. The Characterization, prepared in 1964 by Douglas J. FEINGLASS, provides an excellent personality sketch of Subject and family.

2. Throughout his tour in Mexico Subject and family remained apart from the Soviet colony, associating chiefly with the SHUBINS (201-266547) and the SILENGALEVS (201-328294). Subject's ill temper, coarse language, and unfriendly wife won him few friends among his colleagues. (See Characterization) Neither did we have many known contacts among the foreign correspondents' community. Those with whom he did frequently associate were representatives of Prensa Latina (PL) and Siempre. The majority of his time was spent in CP liaison in Mexico, Ecuador, and Cuba. He was also actively involved with various leaders of the Movimiento Liberacion Nacional (MLN) and Central Campesina Independiente (CCI), particularly in the rural areas of Ensenada, Tijuana, and Mexicali. He took these occasions to contact local Russian emigres and, in one instance, to develop a rural recruiter to assess Mexican youths desiring to study in the USSR.

Prospectivo Audio Installation Against Apartment of Ivan ALFERYEV

References: A. BUENOS AIRES 9864, 25 January 1968
B. BUENOS AIRES 9879, 26 January 1968

1. The Station has long been interested in the fact that but two Soviets roside outside of the Soviet "compounds." In the fall of 1967 wo hogan a unilateral investigation and casing of the apartment thon occupied by Viktor FILIPPOV. Our unilateral investigation revealed that the lock on the door of this apartment was a Trabex--a look which requires at a minimum sovoral hours of picking. Simultaneous to our unilateral investigation wo learned of FILIPPOV's planned PCS doparture. We also learned that the Soviets intended to koop his apartment and that it was to be occupied by FILIPPOV's roplacement. In mid-January wo decided to send BIBAFFLE-3 to tho apartmont building in order to herriond the portero. We had hoped that the portero would be able to furnish us with a key to the apartment. On 25 January we learned that Ivan ALFERYEV was arriving in Buenos Aires on 27 January. Unfortunately time had run out on us. We therefore decided to turn to BIOGENESIS.

2. There wore several reasons for this decision. First of all, we do not doubt the oporational value of having an aud! installation in the apartment of an identifiod sonior KGB officer. However, a unilatoral installation, is a difficult and at times risky operation. Considering this and matching it against the potential tako of the oporation wo folt that a: joint oporation would ho moro peaotienl. Cost also influencod our docision. At the same time our oxporionce with BIOGENESIS in the "Vista" oporation showed that BIOGENESIS was perfectly willing to give us and only us the tapes from the audio installation.

HABA-19, 206

3. As oxplained in Reference A we briefed BIOGENESIS
   in the early afternoon of 25 January. BIOGENESIS immediately
   issued instructions that the portero of the building be
   approachod. This was accomplished successfully in the
   late afternoon of the same day. Unfortunately the portero
   did not have a koy. The same night a BIOGENESIS team of
   three (including BIBAFFLE-3 and BIOGENESIS-14) attempted
   in vain to pick the lock. In the course of this lock-
   picking exorcise PIBAFFLE-3 had to identify BIOGENESIS
   interest in the apartment to the owner of the neighboring
   apartment. Fortunately this individual is wealthy and
   was cooperative.

4. Once we had been forced to temporarily withdraw
   (ALFERYEV occupied the apartment on 27 January), we
   obtained through BIOGENESIS the blueprints of the target
   apartment and the apartments which abutted. A study of
   thoso bluoprints shows that the apartment belonging to
   tho woalthy cooperative neighbor has a maid's room which
   sharos tho wall of the living room of ALFERYEV'S
   apartmont. Wo pointed this out to BIOGENESIS and suggested
   that they onlist the further cooperation of the owner in
   order that a microphono could be installed through the
   common wall. Unfortunately the owner had departed for
   several wooks leaανο.

5. The owner should be back in 'Buenos Aires at
   this timo and wo have instructed BIOGENESIS to approach
   him again and to move on with the operation. We are also
   presently working on an LP.

6. Wo shall koop you advised of our progress in
   this oporation.

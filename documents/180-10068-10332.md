Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6

Number of Postponements: 2

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

MEMORANDUM

TO: TOM LAMBETH
FROM: KENNETH D. KLEIN
DATE: JUNE 14, 1977
RE: CLARENCE DAY - INVESTIGATOR

It is my recommendation that Clarence Day be hired as an investigator for the JFK Task Force. His resume is very impressive and his long career as a law enforcement officer certainly qualifies him to be an investigator for this Committee.

Equally important were his reactions to the questions I posed to him. He came across as an intelligent man who is well versed in the law as it applies to the rights of individuals, and he impressed me as a man who would be a valuable member of our task force.

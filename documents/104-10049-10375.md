SPECIFIC- PAWLEY Business Interests in the Dominican Republic

1. In addition to minerals exploitation in which Mr. William D. PAWLEY has substantial investments, negotiations are being concluded for the purchase by PAWLEY of the Hotel Hamaca in Boca Chica, a resort town near the almost-completed new international airport, about 30 km east of Ciudad Trujillo.

2. Another activity which is kept very much under wraps is the concession granted PAWLEY for procurement and world-wide sale of all new issues of Dominican postage stamps. This activity is managed by Edward P. PAWLEY, brother of William, whose office is in the Dominican post office building.

3. The source (considered sensitive) of the information in paragraph 2. is Mrs. Nora BRITZIUS, a U. S. citizen employed by PAWLEY, in the stamp business. The source volunteered the information on a very confidential basis to Helene I. DAHLERUP at a social gathering.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:
HL-3059, 2 June 65
REF: OPHA-7261, 4 June 65

ACTION: FYI

1.  Subject was interviewed for an immigrant visa on 7 July 65. Unfortunately Clastonbury could not be present because of other business. The interviewing officer was briefed prior to the meeting and faced the applicant with a series of questions regarding her association with Soviets and any approaches that may have been made to her in light of her unusual life. In response to these questions, we are told that SLIOOR gave thoughtful consideration to each question and probably truthfully replied that although she has met several Soviet diplomats, no approaches for cooperation were made to her. She realized the full implication of the questions and made no attempts to be evasive. Subject was given her visa immediately after the interview.

2.  Attachment 1 is a translation of the VALIK traces on subject. As noted in the traces SLIOOR was an acquaintance of *Griperiv.com* (201-150156) and Georgiy *STERING:* born 29 June 1913 in Moscow (aka Georgi STEINING OPHA-1807, 30 July 56 and OPHW-1456, 9 October 56). These names were not used in the interview.

3.  Attachment 2 is a thermofax copy of SLIOOR's visa; Attachment 3; birth record; Attachment 4, marriage certificate.

4.  From subject's visa application her address in the U.S. is listed as Fort Hood, Texas.

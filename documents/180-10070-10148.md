MEMORANDUM

TO: Thomas Howarth, Budget Officer

FROM: G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director

DATE: October 14, 1977

SUBJECT: Resignations

This memorandum is to inform you that Muff/Rosen is on administrative leave from now until November 14, 1977. She should continue on the payroll for that period of time plus any additional vacation that she has not yet taken.

This memorandum is also to inform you that Alice Hamlin is on administrative leave between now and November 14. It is my understanding that she does not have any additional vacation time. Consequently, she should remain on the payroll through November 14.

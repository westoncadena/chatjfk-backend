Mr. John F. Blake.
Director of Personnel

Washington, D.C., 20505

Dear Mr. Blake:

I am writing to you personally and directly at the suggestion of my old friend and new neighbor, Don Marelius.

As the records will show I retired in the spring of 1971 after 40 years of Federal service 27 of which were with the Agency and predecessor organizations. At the time of my retirement a small ceremony was held, presided over by Mr. Tom K., and I was shown various items attesting to my length of service, dedication to duty, etc. However, I was not permitted to take these items with me due to certain cover considerations which I admit have never been quite clear to me. I was told informally in the division that perhaps after a year the items would be forwarded to me. It will soon be three years and I have not yet received them.

I am sure I don't need to tell you how much these items mean to me and what they will mean to my sons in later years. Therefore I would appr√©ciate hearing from you as to the status of these items. I am sure there are many other fellows in the same boat.

Anxiously awaiting your reply, I am

Sincerely,

James A. Noel

Dear Tom-

I am taking advantage of Gene's coming visit to washington to send you this little note.

We will be moving to the San Diero area the end of this month and hoped to be settled into our new home there by the time mid-September rolls around.

Tom, you will recall that at the time of my retirement you presented me with a letter from Dick, a certificate of service, and (I understood) a silver medallion. All of these items were then returned to be safely stored avay until some future date - not specified. I am sure you can appreciate that these items mean an awful lot to me - and eventually will mean a lot to my two sons. I realize and appreciate the need, because of cover reasons, for discretion with respect to displaying these items to friends, etc. At the same time I realize that as the years pass the chances of these items getting "lost" or falling between the chairs back home is very good. I do not want to lose them and it goes without saying that I would honor any restrictions that might be imposed in the event they are sent to me. The outfit in past years has entrusted me with top secrets, with the management of unvouchered funds, with details of sensitive operations..

Surely it can now to trust me to use intelligent discretion in the safeguarding of these items I write about. I would appreciate it Tom if you would take this request into careful con-sideration.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

When I saw you last in Washington you
promised one day you would be making a trip out
to San Diego. I am holding you to that and
hope it will be soon.

Lillian joins me in sending you our warmest
regards. Don't forget - wherever I am you
and the outfit have a sincere friend who is pre-
pared to help out to the best of his ability.

Sincerely,

![Signature]

MEMORANDUM FOR: SA/ADDP

SUBJECT: Mr. James A. Noel

1. Mr. James Noel was uninterruptedly employed by the Department of State from 1931 to 1968. From 1931 to 1944 Mr. Noel was a bona fide Foreign Service Officer. Since 1944 his Department of State employment was in cover status while he was with OSS, SSU, CIG and CIA. He ostensibly retired from the Department of State in 1968. Until his actual retirement from CIA in 1971, he had cover as a consultant for the Department of Army. Mr. Noel received a 35 year certificate and service pin from the Department of State in lieu of the usual CIA retirement documentation and awards. Mr. Noel retired under cover and continues to be administered in this manner.

2. Under current guidelines, personnel retiring from CIA under cover do not receive any CIA retirement documentation or awards since this would be inconsistent with the retention of cover in retirement status.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Retirement Affairs Division

SUBJECT : Mr. James A. Noel

REFERENCE : Dispatch USFT-1584, 19 March 1970

1. Attached is a copy of a dispatch from subject, now a career agent - in which he poses certain questions with respect to his retirement status based on former service with the Department of State. We forwarded the dispatch to Central Cover Staff, for action with the Department of State. We were informed that there is no record of subject's service in Mexico either with the Civil Service or the Department of State, since records have been destroyed.

2. Since subject's retirement plans are directly involved with the service claimed, it would be appreciated if his records could be checked. Perhaps the Records Center could be checked.

Retirement Plans

REF: UE73-860, 26 February 1970

1. Reference has been seen and noted by and Headquarters offer to assist him in programming his retirement is greatly appreciated.

2. There is a matter in which Headquarters could be of sistance and which, conceivably, could influence a decision on the part of to retire before he reaches his 60th birthday in March 1971. It is this:
   Received from LIGOLD on 15 August 1964, to accept employment on 10 August 1944, with LONIVA, he had to his credit with LIGOLD a considerable amount of annual and sick leave accrued over a period of about fourteen years. Due to regulations or practices in effect at that time he was not paid for his annual leave but was told that both his annual and sick leave balance would be held in escrow and if he returned to LIGOLD employment in the future the credits would be reinstated. Years later integrated into LIGOLD, 20 ing credit and sick leave credits and  the integration project that reinstatement of his leave could not be granted due to the fact that there had been a "break" in the continuity of 's government.

service" as reflected by the papers submitted by Foresters to INGOLD in connection with the integration process. The break in the continuity of service was completely fictitious but was inserted into the employment record of by our cover people for some technical reason not clear to by.

Has been in continual government service from January 26 1931 to date without a single day's break in service, as his personnel record will disclose. He realizes, of course, that he has long lost his annual leave credit with INGOLD and the lost annual leave is therefore not a matter of contention at this writing. However, he is most interested in ascertaining whether the sick leave which was to his credit when he resigned from INGOLD in 1944 was to recovered and added to his sick leave balance now being told by Kylock. Since unused sick leave can now be used in computing longevity for retirement purposes, the recovery of this sick leave could play an important part in retirement plans. Consequently, he would greatly appreciate it if the appropriate headquarters officials would look into this matter at their earliest convenience.

3. Would also like to raise another matter relating to his service with INGOLD. He served from October 1933 to July 1941 at Mazatlan, Mexico, which was then designated by the INGOLD as an "unhealthful post" for retirement purposes. Each year of duty at an unhealthful post entitled the employee to one and one half years of credit for retirement purposes. Would appreciate learning whether his service at Mazatlan during the period mentioned would, under present rules, entitle him to extra retirement credit.

4. A ruling by Headquarters on the two points raised is respectfully requested.

William G. POLAND

MEMORANDUM FOR: James A. Noel

SUBJECT: Retirement Planning

1.  As a participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System, you will reach mandatory retirement at age 60. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought and planning because of its impact on each of us and for this reason, we are taking this opportunity to provide you with this advance notice that according to our records you will be required to retire on March 1971.

2.  Planning ahead can bring about, with each passing year, definite progress toward your retirement goals and the Agency is anxious to assist you in your retirement planning.

3.  We would like to make available to you as much information as possible on the general subject of retirement, your annuity estimates, life and health insurance protection in retirement, opportunities for other employment, Social Security benefits, and other additional material which is available. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory service should be made available and, hopefully, will be used by employees well in advance of the date of retirement.

4.  Our Chief, Retirement Branch, on extension 3257, is available to discuss with you any aspect of your retirement planning and we encourage you to contact him.

Director of Personnel

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

THRU: DDP/OP

SUBJECT: PCS Return Prior to Completion of Tour of Duty - James A. Noel

REFERENCE: CSN-20-59, dated 17 November 1965

1. This memorandum contains in paragraph 2 a recommendation for the approval of the Director of Personnel.

2. Mr. Noel arrived in Madrid as the Chief of Station on 21 September 1961. After home leave, he returned to Madrid on 7 August 1964, for a second tour of duty which would normally be completed on 6 August 1966. We have been advised that upon completion of his current assignment, Mr. Noel will be assigned as Chief of the DODS field office in San Francisco, California. Since the officer now filling that position is required to leave in early September for another assignment, it is very desirable that Mr. Noel arrive in San Francisco about 6 September. Therefore, it is requested that Mr. Noel be permitted to leave Madrid on or about 1 July 1966. This will permit him to take some home leave and arrive at his new post in sufficient time to settle his family, which includes two school age children, and report for his projected assignment on schedule.

alose rolation to the job he is doing. Since this job is directly concerned with national security and the national interest, and has been consistently well done, I believe that Mr. Boel can be Baid with sincerity to be an employee of unquestionable loyalty and integrity.

Mr. Noel is much too experienced and practiced a hand for his performance to vary very much from year to year. He has continued in in the highly creditable performance in San Francisco that has been standard for him for many years. He has managed his subordinates well and has exercised uniformly good judgment in directing their operational efforts. Of particular value has been his steadiness in the face of administrative adversity disrupting the organization of his Base. Mr. Nocl insured that the work of the Base continued uninterrupted and demonstrated his capacity to keep on top of all details and report them to Headquarters as appropriate. It is a credit to Mr. Noel that in the post-Ramparts exposure period there was not a single instance of an academic asset withdrawing from a relationship with the Base.

The performance of his officers atteststhe careful guidance and wise -leadership which has enabled them to operate securely and well in sensitive areas. His realtions with the FBI and DCS are excellent. He is appropriately economy minded. In short, he is a decidedly strong super-vis√∂r.

Mr. Noel is an old hand at running Bases or Stations abroad and his performance as Chief of Base, San Francisco, amply attests that. It goes without saying that he understands all aspects of the business, knows how to delegate, organize, direct and report. He has continued to do all these things well. His seniority, experience and maturity served the Agency in particularly good stead during this period when the location of his Base was compromised in the public press, through no fault of Mr. Noel. His subsequent and consequent actions were all taken with sound judgment and appropriate calm and circumspection. He was also most receptive to, and cooperative in, Headquarters suggestions in this matter. He is, of course, cost conscious and an excellent supervisor. His overall performance is that of a high order of senior Agency officers.

He recruited QUIP/l during the rating period, arranged a new cover job for HARRIOTT through QUWIND/1, and participated in the handling of QUMALT and QUHOPS.

4.  Subject is an experienced and mature officer, possessing an excellent command of Spanish. Highly motivated, conscientious, and industrious, he readily accepts responsibility and is both thorough and reliable in the execution of his duties. Even tempered and affable, he holds the confidence and friendship of those whom he directs and those to whom he is responsible, and the morale of his station is noticeably high. He is alert to the operational possibilities

of any given situation, evidences sound and objective judgment,
and works well under pressure. He writes lucidly, speaks
articulately, and exhibits a high degree of cost consciousness
in the use of government funds and property. His delegation of
responsibility to others is meaningful and well delineated.

5. Subject's performance has been strong throughout the
   rating period. He has given the station purposeful direction
   and competent management and as an effective supervisor who
   commands the loyalty and respect of those whom he supervises, he
   has succeeded in obtaining a maximum effort from the station
   personnel. He enjoys the confidence of the Ambassador and other
   principal officers of the Embassy, several of whom have expressed
   their appreciation of subject's work and commented on the value
   of the station's contribution to the functioning of the Embassy..
   The fact that the Ambassador arrived in Madrid with definite
   prejudices regarding the Agency but was of quite another mind
   upon his departure is testimony to subject's skill and tact.

6. Subject has conducted the Agency's liaison with the
   Spanish services most competently, as evidenced by the rela-
   tionship he established with Captain General Munoz Grandes, his
   ability to persuade the AEM to undertake sensitive operations
   in Cuba, and the fact that this liaison did not suffer following
   the attack on the Spanish ship "Sierra Aranzazu". Marked
   progress has been achieved in joint CE and CP operations, and
   subject has developed QUANTUM/30 to the point wherein the
   latter's collaboration far exceeds the cooperation normally
   expected in an official liaison relationship.

7. In addition to his considerable executive and liaison
   duties, subject has carried out the previously cited opera-
   tional assignments with marked ability. He is a convincing and
   persuasive agent handler, and his operational reporting is
   prompt and thorough.

8. The only criticism I would make of subject is that I
   believe the station should bemaking a greater effort to develop
   internal assets who will be able to report on and influence
   developments in Spain following the departure of Franco.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

SECTION-C

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommended training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in section 8 to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Noel has ably administered a large Station and has displayed maturity, good judgment and tact in the day-to-day management and direction of Station activities and personnel. This has been achieved despite the physical location of Station staff personnel in a number of separated office sites.

Under the direction of Mr. Noel a far reaching and fruitful major operational program against the high priority Cuban target has been undertaken and Madrid Station today is making a substantial contribution in good operations and good intelligence information to the over-all Agency effort. Another notable accomplishment directly attributable to Mr. Noel, and in part a reflection of his long years of service in Latin America, has been his professional handling personally of the Station operation involving Juan Peron. Interested CB components have stated categorically that Madrid Station coverage of Juan Peron and his activities is essential in satisfying existing intelligence requirements on Peronism.

Despite the Station's heavy diversion into Cuban and Latin American activities and State Department policy restrictions on internal political activities, Mr. Noel has encouraged the development of a long-range program involving activities against the Spanish Communist Party and clandestine contact with the Spanish political opposition.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, WE

SUBJECT: Mr. James A. Noel
Fitness Report Covering the Period 14 August 1961 to
31 March 1962

1. Mr. Noel assumed his duties as Chief of Station, Madrid on 23 September 1961. The Station, as constituted when Mr. Noel arrived, included some 21 staffers plus numerous contract personnel, as well as a two man base in Barcelona. The Madrid Station proper not only includes the Embassy installation but an outside operations section as well. Since Mr. Hoel arrived the Station has been launched into a Cuban operations program of considerable scale and on a crash basis. In addition, in this period, one State cover slot was withdrawn, and the experienced Chief of Base, Barcelona had to be brought home due to a family emergency.

2. To date Mr. Noel has given every evidence of a particular ability to cope with the crash program and the acute shortage of personnel with judiciousness and maturity. While it is too early, yet, to pass judgement, there are indications that Mr. Noel has been preoccupied with Cuban problems (an area of special interest to him) to the detriment of lower priority but, nonetheless, necessary Spanish targets (for example, contact with the local opposition and a budding effort against the Spanish Communist Party).

3. As indicated above, Mr. Noel has not been in place as Chief of Station long enough to justify firm reservations concerning his management, nor to permit meaningful criticism. Also, as indicated above, his outstanding noticeable strength to date has been his ability to cope with a heavy operational program, a shortage of personnel, and a sometimes difficult operational climate, with judgement, calmness and patience.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT:-
James A. Noel -
Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report

Mr. James A. Noel arrived in Havana, in September of 1958, a trifle more than three months before Fidel Castro assumed power on 1 January 1959. With the advent of that new government Cuba became, so far as U.S. economic and political interests are concerned, one of the most important spots in the world, as well as increasingly more difficult to conduct CIA business. As a result, with the constant worsening of Cuban-U.S. relationship, it is doubtful that there is at the present time a more difficult assignment than Havana in this Division. Nevertheless, with an extremely limited staff, Noel has been able to continue, and even extend, his operations to the point where almost every significant phase of Cuban life is covertly covered. When the increase of anti-U.S. feeling is considered, to say nothing of the increase of effectiveness of the Cuban counterintelligence resulting from its direction by Soviet professionals, it is amazing that Noel has been able to produce the great volume of important reports which he has sent. He has conducted some extremely delicate operations in the face of almost certainty of discovery. In all this, however, he has offered leadership of a high quality to his staff and has been a fine example of good morale, which is reflected in the attitude of every member of his staff, all of whom respond readily and without complaint to the demands made of them by their surrounding circumstances. Mr. Noel deserves to be warmly commended for a job well done.

## SECTION IV

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to particular job or assignment. The descriptive notes are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are series of statements that apply to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Read the statement on the left then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have a definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

1.  An analysis of the compromise and arrest of Agency personnel in Havana on 14 September 1960, originally made by the Chief, Operational Services, and since confirmed by a review committee, assigns to all Division responsibility for command failures in control and supervision of a sensitive operation. I find that the following officers, by reason of the official assignments they then held, could or should have exercised such control and supervision:

James A. Kool as Chief of Station, Havana

SUBJECT : Integration of James A. HOEL

1.  On 20 March 1952 the Department of State was requested to integrate Mr. James A. NOEL for assignment as Chief of the 050 station at Caracas, Venezuela. It is understood that Mr. Noel's papers are still in process at the Department..

2.  This Division has now been informed that the medical staff of CIA will not approve an overseas assignment for Fr. Nool until 1 August 1952. At that time 'r. NOZE will undergo another physical examination and if results are satisfactory he will be certified as fit for overseas duty.

3.  In order to avoid cancellation of Mr. NOEL's appointment, it is requested that the Department of State be asked not to call Mr. NCEL to enter on duty until advised by OSO that he is certified for overseas duty and ready to proceed to his Caracas assignment, subject to State's concurrence. It is anticipated that this will occur about 1 August 1952, or shortly thereafter.

   KLOBUKAR's Base contact will meet him under safo apartment
   conditions.

8. Attachod are covor suggestions prepared by KLOBUKAR.
   Those suggestions clearly indicate the types of cover that
   could be plausibly and feasibly established for a person
   of KLOBUKAR's background.

Chief of Base, San Francisco

Request to Revert to Civil Survice Retirement System

Reference: USFS-577 dated 21 April 1967.

1.  On 26 November 1967, I reached the "break even" point between the Civil Service Retirement System and the Organization's System, having completed 36 years and 11 months of Government Service on that date.

2.  Since I plan to work until age 60, at which time I will have 40 years of Government Service, it is my desire to revert to the Civil Service System in order to take advantage of the increased annuity under that System.

3.  I would appreciate it therefore if you would take whatever steps may be necessary to transfer my retirement account back to the Civil Service Retirement System.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: James A. Noel

12 March 1968

1. Chief, DO and I talked to Jim Noel this morning about the possibility of his converting from staffer to career agent. After considerable discussion, Jim agreed to the conversion. He is obviously doing this reluctantly, but he appreciates the situation within the DDP in which the encumbrance of senior grades by long- time employees is blocking the promotions of junior officers.

2. Jim urged that he be retained as a career agent until he reaches the age of mandatory retirement (about three years). Chief, DO stated that the need in the San Francisco area for handlers of contacts and assets is such that there would be a continuing need for experienced career agents on the outside of the small San Francisco Base. I told Jim that unless he pulled something stupid, he was virtually assured of career agent status until he reached age 60, and perhaps could be employed as a retired annuitant after that time if his performance was productive and if operational requirements remain as they are at present.

3. Jim explained why he could not retire -- the next five years will be difficult for him financially with two teen-age boys to put through college.

4. Chief, DO and Jim will work out the details and timing of his conversion to career agent.

18 JUL 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. James A. Noel

SUBJECT: Retirement Information

1.  There are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System than under the Organization System. Because of this, the policy decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than eighteen months prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Since you will complete 37 years of Federal service in January of next year it is felt that you should be advised of your retirement status under the Organization System and also if returned to the Civil Service System. The following information is being submitted to assist you in determining which course of action you desire to follow:

a. During the period from 15 August 1944 through 19 October 1946 there were no retirement deductions withheld from your salary. In order for this time to be credited in counting total service under the Organization System it would be necessary for you to make a deposit, with interest, to cover this period. The maximum annuity under our system is 70 per cent based on 35 years of creditable service. If you should return to the Civil Service System in order to receive the maximum annuity it would be necessary for you to make a deposit, with interest, to cover that period for which no contributions were made; however, you may receive full credit in counting total service without making a deposit but your annuity will be reduced by one-tenth of the amount due as deposit.

b. As you are aware, you are presently entitled to apply for voluntary retirement under the Organization Retirement and Disability System. The annuity estimate given below as of 31 October 1967 would be applicable if a deposit were made to cover the period for which no deductions were withheld. The annuity estimate given for 31 March 1968 would be applicable without a deposit since you would have completed 35 years of creditable service at that time without this period of service.

|                                         | 31 October 1967 |            | 31 March 1968 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
|                                         |                 |            |               |
| Basic Annuity                           | $14,265.00      | $14,640.00 |               |
| Reduced to Provide for Survivor Benefit | $13,109.00      | $13,446.00 |               |
| Survivor Benefit                        | $7,848.00       | $8,052.00  |               |

SUBJECT: Retirement Information

e. If you were to return to the Civil Service Retiroment System, you would be entitled to retire under the 55-30 optional provision at any time after you have been back in that system for a period of one year. The Civil Service Regulations state that to retire under the Civil Service Retirement System an employee must have been under that system for at least one year during the two years immediately preceding retirement under that System. Therefore If you should desire to return to the Civil Service System you should submit a request to Headquarters sufficiently in advance of your planned retirement in order to allow time for your request to be acted upon and for transfer to be made effective, as well as allowing for the aforementioned one year required by Civil Service Regulations. The following annuity estimate would be applicable in this situation as of 31 December 1968, assuming a deposit is made:

|                                            |            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Basic Annuity                              | $15,755.00 |
| Reduced to Provide for<br>Survivor Benefit | $14,450.00 |
| Survivor Benefit                           | $ 8,664.00 |

2.  The above information is being forwarded for your consideration and should not be considered as anything more. If you have any questions regarding the above please feel free to forward them to Headquarters.

MEMORANDUM FOR: James A. Noel

SUBJECT : Retirement Planning

1. As a participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System, you will reach mandatory retirement at age 60. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought and planning because of its impact on each of us and for this reason, we are taking this opportunity to provide you with this advance notice that according to our records you will be required to retire on March 1971.

2. Planning ahead can bring about, with each passing year, definite progress toward your retirement goals and the Agency is anxious to assist you in your retirement planning.

3. We would like to make available to you as much information as possible on the general subject of retirement, your annuity estimates, life and health insurance protection in retirement, opportunities for other employment, Social Security benefits, and other additional material which is available. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory service should be made available and, hopefully, will be used by employees well in advance of the date of retirement.

4. Our Chief, Retirement Branch, on extension 3257, is available to discuss with you any aspect of your retirement planning and we encourage you to contact him.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

THRU : DDP/OP

SUBJECT : PCS Return Prior to Completion of Tour
of Duty - James A. Noel

REFERENCE : CSN-20-59, dated 17 November 1965

1. This memorandum contains in paragraph 3 a recommendation for the approval of the Director of Personnel.

2. Mr. Noel arrived in Madrid as the Chief of Station on 21 September 1961. After home leave, he returned to Madrid on 7 August 1964, for a second tour of duty which would normally be completed on 6 August 1986. We have been advised that upon completion of his current assignment, Mr. Noel will be assigned as Chief of the DODS field office in San Francisco, California. Since the officer now filling that position is required to leave in early September for another assignment, it is very desirable that Mr. Noel arrive in San Francisco about 6 September. Therefore, it is requested that Mr. Noel be permitted to leave Madrid on or about 1 July 1986. This will permit him to take some home leave and arrive at his new post in sufficient time to settle his family, which includes two school age children, and report for his projectod assignment on schedule.

Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report for Cecil J. KLOBUKAR
for the Period 31 March 1969 to 31 March 1970

Cecil J. KLOBUKAR, a career agent, has been primarily targeted against the local consular community during this reporting period. For this purpose he has maintained membership in two local organizations concerned with foreign affairs. More than that, he has been an active contributor to their programming and has participated in most of their social and cultural functions. This has enabled him to come in contact with a relatively large number of consulate officers. During the past year he has met, on one or more occasions, thirty consular members. He is concentrating, however, on the ten consulates which have representation in the denied and semi-denied areas. Within this area he is further refining the target by attempting to contact the more junior officers who give promise of a longer future career and a greater chance of being posted to an area of operational interest. To date, he has succeeded in establishing such contacts in the Japanese, Finnish and Indian Consulates. In this last case he has successfully passed the target to another Base officer for further development and hopes to accomplish the same with his Japanese and Finnish contacts.

In addition to this primary responsibility, KLOBUKAR also handles a support asset who is targeted against the academic community. He is directing this asset's efforts in the cultivation of two promising leads -- one, Japanese and the other, Vietnamese. Both of these cases are progressing very well due in great part to the direction and guidance which KLOBUKAR gives to the support asset.

KLOBUKAR also played a very important and direct role in the assessment and intermediate cultivation of TWPARROT/1 and TWPARROT/2 who were subsequently successfully recruited. He is now developing a local QKWAFER student who is an interesting, but difficult, recruitment prospect.

KLOBUKAR is cost conscious in the expenditure of operational funds; he does not have supervisory responsibilities.

As has been indicated above, KLOBUKAR has made excellent progress in gaining access to the consular community and in maintaining personal contact with potential recruitment prospects. He has also done extremely well in his direct participation in the academic area and in the supervision and direction of his support asset; his performance has been **Strong**.

27 May 1969

Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report for Cecil J. KLOBUKAR
for the Period 26 July 1968 to 31 March 1969

Cecil J. KLOBUKAR was the Chief of this Base until July 1968 at which time he was assigned new duties as a career agent, targeted primarily against the San Francisco consular community. Until that time there was no specific program aimed at the official foreign community. It was KLOBUKAR's responsibility, therefore, to break ground in this new target area. He went about this chore in an orderly and organized manner by refining the community to those which were of priority interest because of their representation in denied and semi-denied areas. He then started looking for a means to get information and gain access to members of this target group. To assist him in this endeavor he recruited two members of the consular community, representing Latin American countries. Since their performance did not live up to expectations, KLOBUKAR took the initiative by joining three local organizations relating to foreign affairs in order to enhance his cover and possibility of direct access as a retired LNGOLD officer. By participating in the gatherings of these organizations, KLOBUKAN. is aiming at direct contact with at least a few of the officers from target consulates.

KLOBUKAR has demonstrated excellent initiative in pursuing as many avenues of approach as possible to this rather difficult target. It is not a cohesive community and does not experience the usual mixing and contact that one finds in normal diplomatic circles. It is fragmented and cliquish and for this reason KLOBUKAR has had to show both imagination and perseverance in probing for access to those specific consulates in which the Base has priority interest. He is now demonstrating his determination to get at this target by exploring another possible means of approach of his own device.

In addition to his primary responsibility against the consular target, KLOBUKAR also handles one support asset currently being used against a high priority student target and three general purpose assets who are used from time to

att to USFT-1498

time in both the business and academic areas. Here he has
done excellent work, particularly in the direction and guid-
ance of the first asset.

KLOBUKAR is cost-conscious in the expenditure of opera-
tional funds; he does not presently have any supervisory
responsibility.

As has been indicated above, KLOBUKAR has been given a
very difficult primary target on which the Base had very
little information or prior experience. While it has been
a frustrating and sometimes exasperating assignment,
KLOBUKAR has shown both initiative and perseverance in
attacking it; his performance has been *Strong*.

Mr. Noel is much too experienced and practiced a hand for his performance to vary very much from year to year. He has continued to turn in the highly creditable performance in San Francisco that has been standard for hins for many years. He has managed his subordinates woll and has exercised uni- fornily good judgment in directing their operational offorts. Of particular value has been his steadiness in the face of administrative adversity disrupting the organization of his Base. Mr. Noel insured that the work of the Base continued uninterrupted and demonstrated his capacity to keep on top of all details and report them to Headquarters as appropriate. It is a credit to Mr. Noel that in the post-Ramparts exposure period there was not a single instance of an academic asset withdrawing from a relationship with the Base.

The perfornance of his officers attestuthe careful guidance and wise leadership which has enabled them to operate securely and well in sensi- tive areas. His realtions with the FBI and DCS are excellent. He is appropriately economy minded. In short, he is a decidedly strong super- visor.

Mr. Noel is an old hand at running Bases or Stations abroad and his performance as Chief of Base, San Francisco, amply attests that. It goes without saying that he understands all aspects of the business, knows how to delegate, organise, direct and report. He has continued to do all these things well. His seniority, experience and maturity served the Agency in particularly good stead during this period when the location of his Base was compromised in the public press, through no fault of Mr. Noel. His subsequent and consequent actions were all taken with sound judgment and appropriate calm and circumspection. He was also most receptive to, and cooperative in, Headquarters suggestions in this matter. He is, of course, cost conscious and an excellent supervisor. His overall performance is that of a high order of senior Agency officers.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: James A. Noel, Employee Serial No. 055292
Fitness Report for the Period 1 April 1964
to 31 March 1965

1. Subject, who was born 19 March 1911, is a GS-16 and has been assigned to Madrid as Chief of Station since October 1961.

2. As Chief of Station, he is charged with the organization and management of the station and is responsible for the planning, direction, and supervision of all its activities. He also exercises general supervision of the Barcelona base. Assisting him and under his general supervision are 24 staff employees and 15 contract employees.

3. Subject serves as the Ambassador's principal intelligence officer, as chairman of the Embassy Defector Committee, as the Agency representative on the Embassy Country Team, and as the coordinator of U.S. clandestine intelligence operations in Spain. Accredited as the Agency's representative to the Spanish Intelligence (AEM) and Security (DGS) services, he plans, directs, and supervises all aspects of the station's multi-level liaison with those services and personally handles the liaison with the Service chiefs and a number of their senior officers. On the operational side, subject handles BISHAD/1, CITIZEN and QUWIND/1. He recruited QUIP/1 during the rating period, arranged a new cover job for HARRIOTT through QUWIND/1, and participated in the handling of QUMALT and QUHOPS.

4. Subject is an experienced and mature officer, possessing an excellent command of Spanish. Highly motivated, conscientious, and industrious, he readily accepts responsibility and is both thorough and reliable in the execution of his duties. Even tempered and affable, he holds the confidence and friendship of those whom he directs and those to whom he is responsible, and the morale of his station is noticeably high. He is alert to the operational possibilities

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 231

of any given situation, evidences scund and objective judgment,
and works well under pressure. He writes lucidly, speaks
articulately, and exhibits a high degree of cost consciousness
in the use of government funds and property. His delegation of
responsibility to others is meaningful and well delineated.

5. Subject's performance has been strong throughout the
   rating period. He has given the station purposeful direction
   and competent management and as an effective supervisor who
   commands the loyalty and respect of those whom he supervises, he
   has succeeded in obtaining a maximum effort from the station
   personnel. He enjoys the confidence of the Ambassador and other
   principal officers, of the Embassy, several of whom have expressed
   their appreciation of subject's work and commented on the value
   of the station's contribution to the functioning of the Embassy.
   The fact that the Ambassador arrived in Madrid with definite
   prejudices regarding the Agency but was of quite another mind
   upon his departure is testimony to subject's skill and tact.

6. Subject has conducted the Agency's liaison with the
   Spanish services most competently, as evidenced by the rela-
   tionship he established with Captain General Munoz Grandes, his
   ability to persuade the AEM to undertake sensitive operations
   in Cuba, and the fact that this liaison did not suffer following
   the attack on the Spanish ship "Sierra Aranzazu". Marked
   progress has been achieved in joint CE and CP operations, and
   subject has developed QUANTUM/30 to the point wherein the
   latter's collaboration far exceeds the cooperation normally
   expected in an official liaison relationship.

7. In addition to his considerable executive and liaison
   duties, subject has carried out the previously cited opera-
   tional assignments with marked ability. He is a convincing and
   persuasive agent handler, and his operational reporting is
   prompt and thorough.

8. The only criticism I would make of subject is that I
   believe the station should bemking a greater effort to develop
   internal assets who will be able to report on and influence
   developments in Spain following the departure of Franco.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Noel has ably administered a large Station and has displayed maturity, good judgment and tact in the day-to-day management and direction of Station activities and personnel. This has been achieved despite the physical location of Station staff personnel in a number of separated office sites.

Under the direction of Mr. Noel a far reaching and fruitful major operational program against the high priority Cuban target has been undertaken and Madrid Station today is making a substantial contribution in good operations and good intelligence information to the over-all Agency effort. Another notable accomplishment directly attributable to Mr. Noel, and in part a reflection of his long years of service in Latin America, has been his professional handling personally of theStation operation involving Juan Peron. Interested CS components have stated categorically that Madrid Station coverage of Juan Peron and his activities is essential in satisfying existing intelligence requirements on Peronism.

Despite the Station's heavy diversion into Cuban and Latin American activities and State Department policy restrictions on internal political activities, Mr. Noel has encouraged the development of a long-range program involving activities against the Spanish Communist Party and clandestine contact with the Spanish political opposition.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, WE

SUBJECT: Mr. James A. Noel
Fitness Report Covering the Period 14 August 1961 to
31 March 1962

1. Mr. Noel assumed his duties as Chief of Station. Madrid on
   23 September 1961. The Station, as constituted when Mr. Noel arrived,
   included some 21 staffers plus numerous contract personnel, as well as
   a two mn base in Barcelona. The Madrid Station proper not only includes
   the Embassy installation but an outside operations section as well. Since
   Mr. Noel arrived the Station has been launched into a Cuban operations
   program of considerable scale and on a crash basis. In addition, in this
   period, one State cover slot was withdrawn, and the experienced Chief of
   Base, Barcelona had to be brought home due to a family emergency.

2. To date Mr. Noel has given every evidence of a particular ability
   to cope with the crash program and the acute shortage of personnel with
   judiciousness and maturity. While it is too early, yet, to pass judgement,
   there are indications that Mr. Noel has been preoccupied with Cuban
   problems (an area of special interest to him) to the detriment of lower
   priority but, nonetheless, necessary Spanish targets (for example, contact
   with the local opposition and a budding effort against the Spanish Communist
   Party).

3. As indicated above, Mr. Noel has not been in place as Chief of
   Station long enough to justify firm reservations concerning his management,
   nor to permit meaningful criticism. Alco, as indicated above, his out-
   standing noticeable strength to date has been his ability to cope with a
   heavy operational program, a shortage of personnel, and a sometimes difficult
   operational climate, with judgement, calmness and patience.

# SUMMARY OF EMPLOYMENT

James A. Noel.

From 1931 to 1944 I served as a Foreign Service Officer in various posts in Mexico. In 1944 I joined OSS/SSU/CIG and from that date until 1947, I worked in Europe and Latin America. In 1947 I again joined the Department of State, and served in many posts in Latin America until 1966 when I returned to the United States for a two (2) year detail with the Department of Army. In 1968 I retired from the Department of State and since then I have been living in the San Francisco area doing occasional work on a consultant basis for the Department of Defense.

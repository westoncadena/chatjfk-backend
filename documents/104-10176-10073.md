While we realize that A'S PER-1 is merely an interrogator, he is, nevertheless, the direct source and should be shown as such in the source description followed by the appropriate subource description. The approved description for ida is "A Cuban exile in Mexico who is in touch with local Cuban exiles and anti-Castro organizations."

Also, please note that when LITAKIL-9's reporting is on Cuba, his description should read "Latin American official in Mexico City who has regular contact with Cuban Embassy personnel; he has been a reliable r-porter for about a year and a half."
"Person(s) (B)" is not acceptable for SA reports.

Sof dissem. Inaccurate. Possibly "open embassies" was meant, rather than "establish diplomatic relations". Both Spain and Brazil have ambassadors in Algiers, and have had for some time. Algeria has announced that it planned to open embassies in several countries, including Brazil and Argentina.

Remarks:

1-6: Recommend that no dissen be made of this.
Zirout probably mean that Algeria would soon open up embassies in these countries, rather than "establish diplomatic relations". Both Spain and Brazil have ambassadors in Algiers. A Cairo MENA item 6 April 64 announced that Algeria planned to open embassies shortly in several countries, including Brazil and Argentina.

Zirout probably mean that Algeria would soon open up embassies in these countries, rather than "establish diplomatic relations". Both Spain and Brazil have ambassadors in Algiers, and have had for some time. A Cairo META item 6 April 64 announced that Algeria planned to open embassies shortly in several countries, including Brazil and Argentina. Our Embassy in Algiers confirmed this on 21 April- and the Brazilian Amb in Algiers said that as far as he knew no changes had been made in these plans in spite of the fall of the Goulart over

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/3

ATTENTION: Wayne Carley

SUBJECT: LITAMIL/9
C-101,331

1. With reference to your memorandum dated 24 June 1963 attaching FRQ Part II and requesting an Operational Approval for Subject's use, your attention is directed to derogatory information forwarded by Station Mexico to the effect that an ODIBEX report dated 25 August 1959 statei that _co_ followed subject to be a communist and one of the most influential members of the Cuban Embassy staff.

2. On 18 September 1962 we requested SAS, which then had Headquarters responsibility for this case, to request Station Mexico City to determine the basis for Mexico G-2's allegation, to obtain any evidence substantiating the allegation, and to conduct such investigation as wes possible to determine the truth or falseness of the allegation. It was further agreed that SAS would determine whether the Station had direct access to Subject and would recomend polygraphing him in it were feasible. We have no indication that any of this has been accomplished or attempted.

3. On 20 February 1963, because of the exigencies of the situation at that particular tine, a Provisional Operational Approval was grantei only for training of Subject. The Provisional Operational Approval specified that approval for operational use of the Subject was deferred pending satisfactory resolution of the derogatory information, whic CI Staff did not consider to have been accomplished. The 792 Part II on Subject clearly shows that he has been used operationally for the past year without any approval.

4. Operational Approval for Subject's use cannot be granted until there has been compliance with our previous request to resolve the derogatory information as reported by ODIBEX from Mexican G-2.

In the HSCA testimony of Silvia Duran she indicated that she

Consulate when she was there. This info was not in the 201
file.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:

LITAMIL-9 was recruited by the Mexico City Station in late
62 while he was assigned to the Cuban Embassy as Cultural
Attache. He provided the Station intelligence while he was
in this assignment. He was deactivated in March 1965 when
he returned to Cuba and was seen only occasionally after
that. His contract was terminated in 1970 because of his
lack of access. Only one relevant document was found which
indicated that Proenza, who worked at the Cuban Embassy,
believed that the strong objection to the Mexican Government
by the Cuban Embassy over the Duran's detention was a
diplomatic error. This document was processed for release.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CI/OA

SUBJECT: Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. The Provisional Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9 (C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.

2. In discussions with the field case officer for this operation, WH/1/Mexico has found that there is no way to determine when, or whether, LITAMIL-9 will again leave Cuba. For reasons of personal security, LITAMIL-9 has not been able to -
   since his return to Cuba in early March 1965. Letters to his brother, LITANIL-17, and reports from occasional Cuban official travelers transiting Mexico indicate that LITAKIL-9 is well and is employed by the National Cultural Council.

3. LITAMIL-9 is now an inactive agent. The Station has recently proposed that his salary cease accumulating as of 30 June 1966. If and when he again manages to leave Cuba, he will be contacted and a full assessment of his future usefulness will be made. Owing to the fact that his sister-in-law is a secretary to Fidel Castro it is expected that he will be a valuable source of information, at least for an initial debriefing period.

4. It would be appreciated if the POA on LITANIL-9 could be extended for six months. If at the end of that time he has not left Cuba, it will be proposed that the POA be allowed to expire.

Translation of a rost card from Kira KOSOVSKA to LITAMIL-9. Kira is the wife of Anguel KOSOVSKI, who was a Second Secretary in the Bulgarian Embassy in Havana as of October 1965. They are now back in Sofia, Bulgaria. The card was mailed from Bulgaria to Cuba.

Dear Luis, how are you? Before leaving I called you to verify your address and, of course, to say "the last goodbye" (for three months!), but you weren't there. Surely you had your mind on the countryside after the hurricane. If you did, I wish that you could climb like during the fifteen days of Girón, that would suit you very well.

We have been in Bulgaria for three days now: one day in Sofia.

The trip went fire, but it was very fatiguing; we couldn't sleep because it wasn't night -- at 9 the sun set and at 12 came out again. In Prague we spent one day while waiting for the plane to Sofia. We are living like Counts of Luxembourg in a luxury hotel. In Sofia everything is fine. It is quite hot during the day, but the nights are very cold. Here in Varna it's the same story, but all the hotels are full of tourists who get brave and go swimming in the cold sea. As for us, we haven't gone swimming yet. And generally after Cuba I am indifferent to the sea. Luis, until later.

Buenos días, Luis! (¿) andan?
Nosotros estamos bien, recordamos fre-
cuentemente a La Habana y a nuestros
amigos (yo - a un hombre, aburrido tam-
bien). Después del "Mit Negro" estuvimos una semana
en Sofid, y la semana siguiente descansamos en la casa
turística de la radio-Sofi (antes de salir para Cuba yo
trabajaba en la Radio-Sofi), situada en la montaña
Tosha, cerca de Sofia. Los búlgaros llaman esa montaña
"pulmones de la capital." Es un lugar muy bonito, nosotros
viviendo en las ciudades, clizamos frecuentemente las alegrias
simples - acistarnos en la hierba y mirar el cielo, escuchar el si-
lencio-verdad? De Titoshka Icordamos fodo eso. Shore esta-
mos en Sofía preparamos para continuar nuestro turismo
por las montañas! A mi me gusta mucho andar, y a

Good morning, Luis! How are you? We are well. We frequently think of Havana and of our friends (I of a "bored" man too). After the Black Sea we spent one week in Sofia, and the following week we relaxed at the Radio Sofia tourist house (before leaving for Cuba I worked for Radio Sofia), located on the Vitusha, near Sofia. The Bulgarians call this mountain "lungs of the capital". It's a very lovely place. Living in the grass and looking at the sky, listening to the silence. Isn't that true? On Vitosha (sic) we remembered all that. We are now in Sofia, preparing to continue our tour through the mountains. I like to walk a lot, and now I have the opportunity. We plan to climb the highest peak in Bulgaria -- Mus-ala (2925 meters). It isn't difficult -- it's not very high. What a good country Bulgaria is, but in my opinion she lacks contemplative men. Yes, yes, that's true. They are all too practical. Until later, Luis!

Translation of a letter from Kira KOSOVSKA to LITA'MIL-9. Kira is the wife of Anguei KOSOVSKI, who was a Second Secretary in the Bulgarian Erbassy in Havana as of October 1965. They are now back in Sofia, Bulgaria. The letter was mailed from Bulgaria to Cuba.

Good evening, Luis! How have you been? Working a lot! as always? Which to choose -- of two opinions on work ("horses die from working" and "work created Man") it is better to choose the second, isn't it?

We are still in Varna, more exactly some 15 kilometers from the city of Varna; this doesn't matter because everything here is the area of beaches, hotels, etc. The weather improved, and now we go swimming and sunbathing, but we do so without eagerness -- we are spoiled permanently by the Santa María and Atlantic beaches and by the Cuban sun! At the Line it is very nice that nore there are no sharks and one can swim anywhere one wants.

In the course of two years we forgot many things and now we are enjoying the climate, nature, etc. It's true here even the air is absolutely different: fresh, healthful, full of the odors of grass and trees. Some 300 - 400 meters from the coast the mountains, covered with forests, begin. I am very sorry that you, Luis, cannot see all this, but I am an optimist and I am sure that sooner or later you will visit Bulgaria. Do you know what they say about the formation of the country? When God was dividing the Earth among the English, the French, and others, the Bulgarian could not come because he was working. Then when he came, there was no land left. God scolded him, but he had to do something. So he took a knife and cut a little piece of paradise for the Bulgarian.

I am not exaggerating -- really the coast of the Black Sea in Bulgaria is very pretty. Now there are about 25 - 30 thousand foreigners here on vacation. And what is very interesting -- the majority from the capitalistic countries. At every step one hears French, German, Swedish. We have an acquaintance -- the manager of one of the hotels; he, for example, says that some families from Switzerland and from Belgium have been living in his hotel for 28 days, and that all are very happy, saying that the vacation in Bulgaria is pleasant and inexpensive at the same time, less expensive than in Nice or Italy. Thus Bulgaria is developing interna-

1


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 131

tional tourisa intensively and, of course, is bringing in
a lot of money.

Eut what be ing things I'm writing! I'm sure that you
are already sleepy. Hot by any means do I want you to think
that these are exercises in Spanish so as not to forget it.
I simply want to relate some of my impressions and observa-
tions, and you, a man so good and fine, can understand, can't
you?

One more interesting thing about the tourist service
here. There are some typical national restaurants open where
Bulgarian fantasy is represented. For example, one repre-
sents a place where there are sheer (I don't know what it is
in Spanish). It's a large patio divided into small patios,
everything like in a town. There is a stone hearth in the
...

stone stove, also with a fire inside. There are some farm
buildings, everything true to life. To make the picture
complete, in one of the small natios there is a burro, in
another, some sheep, and ... they all have a terrible odor!
But everybody is happy and taking pictures, etc. The waiters
are dressed in national costumes and the national orchestra
plays too. Can you imagine it, Luis? It's very nice! The
other restaurant, for example, represents the interior of
(I don't know in Spanish, in French -- the mill). There is
the stone for grinding, there are filled sacks where you sit,
etc., etc. The food is served in national dishes ... but
let's not talk about feed -- there is everything in abundance.
After the first admirations ("what delicious cherries!",
what big peaches!", etc.), I discovered a great danger for
me in all this. If, for example, Anguel gains 2 - 4 pounds,
it's no problem but for se it's problem #1!

I'll close now. Before closing I'll tell you a joke
(appropriate!). A family went to bed one night. Suddenly
a loud noise was heard -- the cat knocked sonething over in
the kitchen. But the frightened woman cried: "Run, my hus-
band is coming!" and her husband, frightened also, jumped
out of the window in his pajamas.

Until later, Luis. I give you my hand. The letter --
between us, is that all right?

Kira KOSOVSKA

PROCESSING ACTION:
MARKED FOR INDEXING
NO INDEXING REQUIRED
ONLY QUALIFIED DESK CAN JUDGE INDEXING
MICROFILM

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: PERUMEN/LIRAVINE/LITAMIL-9/Operational Progress Report

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES: Reference: HMMA 26552, 8 July 1965

1.  LITAMIL-9 seems to be trapped inside PBRUMEN. On 18 August the Case Officer met with LITAMIL-17 (L-9's brother) to review two letters received from L-9. One of these, dated 15 July and mailed at Gander, Newfoundland (presumably by an airline crew member), used the term "de lo mas bien." This is an indicator meaning "I expect to leave within a year." In another (undated) letter L-9 reports that he has been promoted to "Secretario de Segunda"

2.  L-9 asked for a large quantity of art supplies and mentioned that he is doing a lot of painting since he has not yet come back to work. The mention of material requested indicates that he expects to remain inside for some time.

3.  The C/O asked L-17 to phone L-9, ostensibly to request further detail on how to ship the art supplies. In the course of the conversation L-17 was to ask L-9 how long he expected to remain in PBRUMEN. L-17 reported on 28 August that he had spoken with L-9. L-9 said he did not expect to leave for "a long time."

4.  With the recent defections of AMWASP-1 and a PBRUMEN Ambassador in Europe it may be difficult for L-9 to obtain a foreign post. It is not likely that he could seriously be considered politically reliable by the PBRUMEN Government. With the return of his mother and sister from Spain he no longer has an excuse to request permission to visit Madrid. The only bright spot on the horizon is his sister-in-law's close relationship to AMTHUG. L-17 feels that it is to her advantage to have L-9 abroad so L-9 can send her consumer goods which are unobtainable in PBRUMEN.

5.  At present the Station has no reason to believe L-9 will be able to leave PBRUMEN any time soon.

Translation of a post card from Kira KOSOVSKA.to LITAMIL-9.
Kira is the wife of Anguel KOSOVSKI, who was a Second Secretary
in the Bulgarian Embassy in Havana as of Octcher 1965. They
are now back in Sofia, Bulgaria. The card was mailed from
Bulgaria to Cuba.

Dear Luis, how are you? Before leaving I called you to verify
your address and, of course, to say "the last goodbye" (for
three months!), but you weren't there. Surely you had your
mind on the countryside after the hurricane. If you did,
I wish that you could climb like during the fifteen days of
Girón, that would suit you very well.

We have been in Bulgaria for three days now: one day in Sofia
and two in Varna in the guest house of the Bulgarian MINREX.
The trip went fine, but it was very fatiguing; we couldn't
sleep because it wasn't night -- at 9 the sun set and at 12
cane out again. In Prague we spent one day while waiting
for the plane to Sofia, We are living like Counts of Luxem-
bourg in a luxury hotel. Ir Sofia everything is fine. It
is quite hot during the day, but the nights are very cold.
Here in Varna it's the same story, but all the hotels are
full of tourists who get brave and go swimming in the cold
sea. As for us, we haven't gone swimming yet. And generally
after Cuba I am indifferent to the sea. Luis, until later.

Translation of a post card from Kira KOSOVSKA to LITAMIL-9.
Kira i the wife of Anguel KOSOVSKI, who was a Second Secretary in the Bulgarian Embassy in Havana as of October 1965. They are now back in Sofia, Bulgaria. The card vas mailed fron Bulgaria to Cuba.

Good morning, Luis! How are you? We are well. We frequently think of Havana and of our friends (I of a "bored" man too). After the Black Sea we spent one week in Sofia, and the following week we relaxed at the Radio Sofia tourist house (before leaving for Cuba I worked for Fadio Sofia), located on the Vitusha, near Sofia. The Bulgarians call this mountain "lungs of the capital". It's a very lovely place. Living in the grass and looking at the sky, listening to the silence. Isn't that true? On Vitosha (sic) we remembered all that. We are now in Sofia, preparing to continue our tour through the mountains. I like to walk a lot, and now I have the opportunity. We plan to climb the highest peak in Bulgaria -- Mus-ala (2925 meters). It isn't difficult -- it's not very high. What a good country Bulgaria is, but in my opinion she lacks contemplative men. Yes, yes, that's true. They are all too practical. Until later, Luis!

# Translation of a Letter

Translation of a letter from Kira KOSOVSKA to LITAVIL-9, Kira is the Life of Angel SOSKI, who was a Second Secretary in the Zulgarian Lebassy in Havana as of October 1965. They are now back in Sefia, Bulgaria. The letter was mailed from Bulgaria to Cuba.

Good evening, Luis! How have you been? Working a lot, as always? thich to choose -- of twe opinions on work ("horses die fren voriing" and "work created "an") it is better to choose the second, isn't it?

We are still in Varna, more exactly some 15 kilometers fron the city of Varna; this doesn't matter because every- thing here is the area of beaches, hotels, etc. The weather irrored, and now we go swimming and sunbathing, but we do se without eagerness -- we are spoiled permanently by the Santa María and Atlantic beaches and by the Cuban sun! Live it is very nice that here there are no sharks and che can swin anywhere one wants.

In the course of two years we forgot many things and now we are enicying the clirate, nature, etc. It's true here even the air is absolutely different: fresh, healthful, fuil of the ocers of grass and trees. Some 300 - 400 neters fron the coast the mountains, covered with forests, begin.

I am very sorry that you, Luis, cannot see all this, but I an an optimist and I am sure that sconer or later you will visit Duigaria. De you know what they say about the formation of the country? When God was dividing the Earth among the English, the French, and others, the Bulgarian could not come because he was working. Then when he came, there was no land left. Cod scolded him, but he had to do something. So he tock a knife and cut a little piece of paradise for the Eul- garian...

I an not exaggerating -- really the coast of the Black Sea in bulgaria is very pretty. Now there are about 25 - 30 thousand foreigners here on vacation. And what is very in- teresting -- the najority from the capitalistic countries. At every step one hears French, German, Swedish. We have an accuaintance the manager of one of the hotels; he, for example, says that sone fanilices fron Switzerland and from Belgium have been living in his hotel for 25 days, and that all are very harry, saying that the vacation in Bulgaria is pleasant and inexpensive at the same time, less expensive than in Nice or Italy. Thus Bulgaria is developing interna-

tional tourism intensively and, of course, is bringing in a lot of money.

But what boring things I'm writing! I'm sure that you are already sleepy. Not by any means do I want you to think that these are exercises in Spanish so as not to forget it. I simply want to relate some of my impressions and observations, and you, a man so good and fine, can understand, can't you?

One more interesting thing about the tourist service here. There are some typical national restaurants open where Bulgarian fantasy is represented. For example, one represents a place where there are sheep (I don't know what it is in Spanish). It's a large patio divided into small patios, everything like in a town. There is a stone hearth in the room, where something boils in a big basket. There is a stone stove, also with a fire inside. There are some farm buildings, everything true to life. To make the picture complete, in one of the small patios there is a burro, in another, some sheep, and ... they all have a terrible odor! But everybody is happy and taking pictures, etc. The waiters are dressed in national costumes and the national orchestra plays too. Can you imagine it, Luis? It's very nice! The other restaurant, for example, represents the interior of (I don't know in Spanish, in French -- the mill). There is the stone for grinding, there are filled sacks where you sit, etc., etc. The food is served in national dishes ... but let's not talk about food -- there is everything in abundance. After the first admirations ("what delicious cherries!", what big peaches!", etc.), I discovered a great danger for me in all this. If, for example, Anguel gains 2 - 4 pounds, it's no problem but for me it's problem #1!

I'll close now. Before closing I'll tell you a joke (appropriate!). A family went to bed one night. Suddenly a loud noise was heard -- the cat knocked something over in the kitchen. But the frightened woman cried: "?un, my husband is coming!" and her husband, frightened also, jumped out of the window in his pajamas.

Until later, Luis. I give you my hand. The letter -- between us, is that all right?

Kira KOSOVSKA

1.  LITAMIL-9 seems to be trapped inside PBE MEN. On 18 August the Case Officer met with LITAMIL-17 (L-9's brother) to review two letters received from L-9. One of these, dated 15 July and mailed at Gander, Newfoundland (presumably by an airline crew member), used the term "de lo mas bica." This is an indicator meaning "I expect to leave within a year." In another (undated) letter L-9 reports that he has been promoted to "Secretario de Segunda"

2.  L-9 asked for a large quantity of art supplies and mentioned that he

of material requested indicates that he expects to remain inside for some time.

3.  The C/O asked L-17 to phone L-9, ostensibly to request further detail on how to ship the art supplies. In the course of the conversation 1-17 was to ask L-9 how long he expected to remain in PBRUMEN. L-17 reported on 28 August that he had spoken with L-9. L-9 said he did not expect to leave for "a long tine."

4.  With the ecent defections of AMNASP-1 and a PBRUMEN Ambassador in Europe it may be difficult for 1-9 w obtain a foreign post. It is not likely that he could seriously be considered politically reliable by the PBRUMEN Government. With the return of his mother and sister from Spain he no longer has an excuse to request permission to visit Madrid. The only bright spot on the horizon is his sister-in-law's close relationship to AMTHUG. L-17 feels that it is to her advantage to have 1-3 abroad so L-9 can send her consumer goods which are unobtainable in PBRUMEN.

5.  At present the Station has no reason to believe L-9 will be able to leave PBRUMEN any time soon.

1. /LITAMIL-9 remains in PBRUMEN. On 19 June 1965 the C/O met with L-9's brother who reported he had talked with L-9 by telephone about 1 June. At that time L-9 was in good health and spirits and key words in his conversation indicated that he had not been bothered in any way by the PBRUMEN Security Service since his return. L-9 said that he was easy for about 3 months at which time he would probably be given a new assignment. He did not reveal whether he expected this to be a foreign assignment.

2. A PRQ Part II on L-9's brother was recently submitted with a request for Operational Approval. As noted therein, it is contemplated that he will be used only as a channel for communications to/from 1-9.

1.  On 6 Kay 1965 the brother of LITAMIL-9 (Subject of reference B),
    contacted the case officer. A meeting was held in Mexico City on the
    night of 7 Fay. 19's brother turned over a postcard dated 25 March and
    a letter dated 8 April, both from I-9. These had been meiled in Mexico
    City on 20 April, presumably by a PERUMEN Airline pilot.

2.  The card and letter revealed that L-9 is still on vacation and
    unmolested by PERUMEN Security forces. His mother and urmarried sister
    returned to PERUMEN from Madrid on 22 March and will presumably remain
    in PERUMEN. L-9 does not know when he will be leaving PERUMEN or where
    he will be stationed but the tone of his letter conveys the impression
    that he will be posted abroad.

3.  In the letter 1-9 again used a code phrase indicating that
    the regime appears to be leaning away from the Communist bloc.

4.  A PRQ, Part II, will be forwarded soon on L-9's brother.

3. It is realized that an operational progress report and a contact report are two different items; however, in view of the detailed nature of the LITAKIL-9 CR's the Station has felt that their submission has satisfied the requirements of operational reporting. The criticism of reference is all the more puzzling since such visitors to the Saztion as Chester D. Dainold, Chief, WHD; Kortan A. Wociley, erstahile Chief of Operations, HD; and Thomas W. Land, present Mexico Branch Chief, have all expressed their approval of the detailed operational reporting on this operation during visits they have made to the Station at which time the reports in question have been brought to their attention.

4. When LITANII-9 next exits PERUMEN, the Station will begin to prepare formal operational progress reports on the operation.

5. As for the questions raised in paragraph 2 of refusence regarding operational security, sdvance information on LITAKIL-9's recall cane from LIENVOY but he was not informed of the imminence of his transfer until it was reported routinely by LITAMIL-7 and was generally known by his calles-gues, is for the inglication that LITAKIL-9 was informed of the Station's capability to intercept Embassy telephone conversations, a careful reading of the Memorandum under critique will show that no such acknowledgement was made, LITANI was informed that "we have a good chance of being told about such a conversation by one of our friends," 1.6. that word will probably get around in Embassy circles that LIFANIL-9 is about to travel to such-and-such a point.

As for the speculation that LITAMIL-3 suspects that Embassy phones are tapped, he has indicated his belief that this is the case ever since he was taken over by the present C/O. In fact, he is prone to say "I called so-and-so on such-and-such a matter, using the phone instead of the intercom so you could hear it!". In cases wherein he has spoken this way, he has been told that chances are we will never hear about the matter discussed unless he reports on it specifically in his meetings with his C/O.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CI/OA

SUBJECT : Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITANIL-9, who has recently returned to Cuba, and has accepted an FI mission from Kexico Station. The Station has expressed its reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged in 1959 that LITAMIL-9 was a Communist, since this course of action would unnecessarily draw attention of this officer to our interest in LITAMIL-9. WH/1 has concurred in this decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory information on LITAKIL-9 is far outweighed by his perfor-

2. Realizing the risk involved in working with any Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAMIL-9's excellent record of cooperation, plus his acceptance of the idea of continued cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of ru Operational Approval. Additionally, we have had audio coverage through the telephone in LITAMIL-9's office for the past two years or more, and during this time the Station has used the installation for spot checking his information, and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his veracity and security or suspect that he is under control of the Cuban service.

3. Attached for your review are several contact reports of LITANIL-9, as requested by är. Lally. Their prompt return will be appreciated. This office will be pleased to cooperate in any further review of this case which will facilitate the OA.

SUBJECT
LITAMIL-9

ACTION PEQUIRED REFERENCES
AR: See Paras 3 and 4

REF: HMMA-25,670 dated 23 March 1965

1. We are pleased that Barker has prevailed upon LITAMIL-9 to return to Cuba and even more important, of course, to agree to be alert to service the cause and again, still better, to agree to the use of a communications system. Considering LITAMIL-9's known reluctance for this sort of thing we understand that Barker had to be quite convincing with his arguments and also very possibly had to resort to some arm-twisting.

2. Nevertheless, lacking operational progress reports and therefore not knowing the full background of Barker's procedures, we did note that in paragraph 3.ii, page 4, of the C/R attached to reference, the Station tipped off LITAMIL-9 that he would probably be requested to return to Cuba. We assume that the tip came from the LIENVOY of LIFEAT take, and, to complete the record here, would appreciate a note as to the origin of the information that LITAMIL-9 was to be transferred. We further note from paragraph 3 of the Memorandum for the Record dated 11 March, also attached to reference, that, in essence, a further acknowledgement was made to LITAMIL-9 that the Station has the capability to intercept Cuban Embassy telephone conversations.

3. While there may be a simple explanation for this report we are constrained to make known our concern that such apparent revelations, however well-intentioned, obviously could cause unpleasant repercussions and are regarded under normal circumstances as basically unsound violations of operational compartmentation and procedure.

4. This all, of course, again raises the practical difficulties encountered in trying to provide meaningful support to the Station when proper operational reporting is consistently neglected as in the case in the LITANIL-9 op. Consistency has virtue only when in the right direction. While we are on it. please note that Cuban op dispatches should be addressed to C/wil; the branch will see that all items reach other interested components.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.

SOURCE: Para. 1: Person (B) with good contacts in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

Para. 2: European businessmen (F).

Appraisal of Content: 2.

1. Since Lid-February 1963 Mexican immigration authorities have placed stamps in the passports of travellers to and from Cuba which read "Arrived from Cuba" and "Left for Cuba". The stamps are placed on the page with the picture.[^1]

2. All requests for Mexican tourist visas in Cuba must be approved in Mexico before they are issued in Habana.[^2]

Field Comments

1. Cuban visas are often issued on a separate piece of paper and not stamped in the passport, so that the passport would not show that the bearer had travelled to Cuba.

2. This regulation was first noticed in February 1963.

Documentation for travel from Mexico to Cuba does not differ from that needed for travel to other Latin American countries. The traveller must have a passport or other travel document, with a valid visa. Mexican citizens within the specified age group must also carry a cartilla militar.

Mexican security services do not screen applications for travel to Cuba. Although the Mexican Government has taken no action to prevent travel to Cuba, it has discouraged government employees from accepting invitations to Cuban-sponsored activities. It also appears to want to avoid recognition of Cuban Government activities by not sending government-sponsored delegations. These steps, plus the bothersome baggage searches, photographs, and questioning by Mexican immigration authorities have probably curtailed travel to Cuba.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE

SOURCE: Paras. 1,3: Person (B) with good contacts in the Cuban Embassy
in Mexico City.

Para. 2: A neutralist diplomat (C) in Mexico City, from
Sori Coulibaly.

Appraisal of Content: 2.

1. On 18 February 1963 Sori Coulibaly, the Ambassador of the
   Republic of Mali to the United Nations and to Cuba, 1 and
   Mamadou Traore, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Mali
   Mission to the United Nations, arrived in Mexico from Habana,
   Cuba. Coulibaly told members of the Cuban Embassy in
   Mexico City that he had spoken with Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign
   Minister, who asked Coulibaly to take steps to have the
   Government of Mali send a resident Ambassador to Cuba.

2. Coulibaly said that the Cubans had put pressure on him to
   open an office in Habana and that they had in fact given him
   a building for this purpose. However, Coulibaly said that
   he did not see how Mali could afford to open an office in
   Habana, in view of the fact that he had hardly enough money
   to operate the Mali Mission to the United Nations.2

3. Coulibaly and Traore left Mexico City on 20 February for
   New York. Coulibaly carried Mali diplomatic passport No. 23;
   Traore carried diplomatic passport No. 42.

1. Headquarters Comment. Coulibaly presented his credentials
   in Cuba on 13 February 1963.

2. Source Comment. Coulibaly confided that he had requested
   50 million Mali francs (about $203,000.00) as an annual
   budget for the operation of the Mali Mission to the
   United Nations; that he had been allotted only one-tenth
   of that amount for the first quarter of 1963; and that
   he had not received even that.

SINOBAS SAID THAT IN HIS OPINION LOPEZ HAD PREPARED THIS MESSAGE AND WAS WAITING FOR HIM. 1-9 SAID THAT HE NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE DIPLOMATS WERE MERELY SHAKING HANDS AND SAYING A FEW WORDS, HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF SINOBAS HE REMAINED WITH LOPEZ LONGER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER DIPLOMATS.

ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT SINOBAS WHO IS A DIPLOMATIC SNOB TOLD ARMONA AND 1-9 THAT THE CHANGES TO TAKE PLACE IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE WOULD MEAN THAT THEY (ARMONA AND 1-9) WOULD NO LONGER BE DIPLOMATS AS SUCH, I.E.

Eexcelentísino Embajador de los E.U. Mexicanos, Sres. Miembros del Cuerpo Diplomático

Sras y Sres.

Es para mi un honor quo en ocasión como esta, represente al Consejo Nacional de Cultura en que se inaugura la exposición "Caleidoscopio Fotográfico" del artista mexicano Nacho López.

Creo sinceramente, que el gran artista Nacho Lopez, no necesita presentación, su arte en muy conocido en Cuba a través de revistas internacionales v peridicos em frenataδυμάνακται ου wavajo artisitico; además no es la primera vez que tengamos el gusto de tenerlo entre nosotros así como a otors tantos mexicanos ilustres que nos han visitado desde el triunfo de la Revolución.

Aquí en esta sala encontraremos un exponente gráfico de lo que tan acertadamente nos dice en su introspectiva el artista que nos ocupa.

"El placer-en ef - más no la diversión - de producir imágenes que despierten ideas y emociones en el espectador, pretendo hacerlo conscientede que el mundo no een cuatro paredes, trabajo y familia; sino que hay otras formas bellas y hor ibles, otros rostros que tambien viven, respiran y mueren, en busca de las mismas necesidades eternas: trabajo, vestido, comida y dignidad."

La exposición que nos disponemos a admirar estrecha aún más los lazos que nos une con el gran pafs hermano México, y no quisiera dejar de destacar en esta oportunidad, la satisfacción que nos produce cooperar con la Embajada de México que ha hecho posible la exposición que se ofrece con- Juntamante con la Seciedad Cubano-Mexicana de Relaciones Culturales y el Consejo Nacional de Caltura (Delegación Provincial)

Muchas gracias,

1. Forwarded an Attachment One, herewith, is a PRQ Part II on LITAMIL-9. Forwarded as Attachment Two, under separate cover, is the Part I of the same DRO As propisional reported, station meets very infrequently with LITAMIL-9, who is very busy, spends most of his time outside Mexico City, and is largely out of touch with PBRUMEN and LIRING. He has, for example, only visited LIRING twice in the last six months. Contacts which LITAMIL-9 made during a recent trip to Europe with PERUMEN officials stationed in that area were unproductive. Since occasional contact is still desired, however, it is requested that a new OA be processed on LITAMIL-9 to cover his use as outlined in the Part II of the PRQ.

2. Traces were rerun on Subject through LNPURE and the Station, and no derogatory information was turned up except for that mentioned in HMMW-11988, which cannot be resolved any further than the Station's comments in MEXICO CITY-3497 of 19 February 1963.

2. In addition to the meetings mentioned in the attached memorandum, the Case Officer, Raymond A. FRADYER, also met L-9 on 28 March. He knew from LIENVOY that Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas was having a reception that night at the Cuban Embassy in honor of Alejo CARPENTIER Belmont. He also knew that CARPENTIER had agreed to meet L-9 earlier that day. FRADYER therefore assumed that L-9 nad probably been invited to the Embassy affair. FRADYER had spent some time at his last meeting with L-9 briefing the latter on elicitation techniques and how he felt 1-9 would safely bring up the subjects of the Vietnam war and French-Cuba relations, two topics on which CARPENTIER coula provide interesting information. FRADYER was disappointed when L-9 told him that he had left his house that morning at 7A.M. and had been at his brother's plant in Toluca the entire day. L-9 added that he would have to spend the next day in Toluca and thus would be unable to talk to CARPENTIER before the latter left.

3. FRADYER is very much aware of Headquarters interest in L-9. Although he plans to meet L-9 regularly, he doubts (as previously mentioned to Clyde K. SHRYOCK when the latter recently visited Mexico) that L-9 will live up to Headquarters expectations. As-mentioned by-L-9 himself:

- A. He is acting as the general manager of the coffee grounds to edible plant in Toluca in which he and his brother own shares. Not only is this a new firm, but the raw material and process used to make the oil are somewhat of a novelty. The plant is deeply in the red (L-9 has yet to receive a salary and commutes to Toluca by bus) and requires close and time consuming attention. With the best of will, it is and will be difficult for L-9 to get away whenever he is needed by this Station.

- B. As pointed out by L-9 himself, L-9 has now been in Mexico for some six months and has succeeded in obtaining from Gobernacion his reinstatement as a resident alien. It must be increasingly evident to the Cubans (despite L-9's request for extended leave from his job in Cuba) that the latter will probably not go back to Cuba. In other words, the Cubans probably view him more and more as an exile.

- C. Because he spends most of his time away from Mexico City and because his Cuban friends are becoming more reserved with him, L-9 has less and less contacts with visiting Cubans. In fact, only one, the Subject of Mexico City 0783, has phoned him when visiting Mexico since L-9's return to this country. L-9, who senses that he is now an exile in the eyes of many of his friends in Cuba, is even reluctant to write to them. He feels, for example, that little would be accomplished by writing to Esebio AZCUE Lopez, as the latter would probably not leave Cuba because of his young wife and child, even though he is fed-up with the Castro regime. On the contrary, L-9 feels that he might not be going AZCUE any favor by writing to him as the latter who is not known for being an enthusiastic supporter of the regime may be under some observation from the Cuban authorities.

4. Information obtained by L-9 from CARPENTIER, Lizandro OTERO and Nicolas GUILLEN indicates

- A. Together with information from other sources that the Cubans probably prearranged to take over the Congress of Latin American Writers with the help of the other Communists and use it for political purposes.

- B. That Cintio VITIER is obviously not trusted by the Castro regime and may be in trouble.

- C. That the Cubans are making a major effort, in line with their pro-French policy to show themselves in Paris under the best light possible.

- D. That CARPENTIER obviously enjoys the confidence of the regime. His trip to Hanoi had certainly nothing to do with cultural affairs. It is regretted that L-9 did not elicit further information from CARPENTIER on his visit to North Vietnam.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM 28 March 1967

SUBJECT: LITAMIL-9 and the Latin American Writer's Congress in Mexico

1. The undersigned reviewed the list of delegates attending the Latin American Writer's Congress with L-9 on 19 March 1967. The latter indicated he knew all the members of the Cuban delegation - Alejo CARPENTIER Delmont,

- Roberto FERNANDEZ Retamar, Lizandro OTERO, Nicolas GUILLEN and Pablo NEREDA, a Chilean writer whom he first met some 25 years ago and saw again about 1962. L-9 stressed he did not know the Cuban delegates to the point of calling anyone of them a personal friend as his dealings with them had been confined to professional contacts when he worked for the National Cultural Council. He had never been invited to their homes or invited them to his. The delegate he felt most at ease with was Alejo CARPENTIER with whom he felt he had more in common than with the others. CARPENTIER who has a French father and white Russian mother lived many years in France and spent some time in South America. L-9 considered him to be an intellectual of definite "bourgeois" background and tastes. Not only is CARPENTIER well known


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 273

- for his novels (L-9 recalled that his name had once been mentioned in connection with the Nobel Prize for literature) and his journalistic writing (L-9 still remembered some of the articles regularly written by him in Paris for the "El Mundo" daily in the pre Castro era), but he is also an established music critic and a connaisseur of modern painting, all in all a talented and most impressive man now in his sixties.
- 2. L-9 had on many occasions offered to help WOFACT in any way possible. The undersigned pointed out that he now had a unique opportunity to do this with the Writer's Congress. WOFACT was interested in assessing the Cuban representatives at this Congress to determine their possible vulnerability to recruitment. It was also interested in hearing from the Cuban delegates what they thought of the Congress and it's accomplishments since it was apparent that the great majority of it's members were Communist sympathizers and would probably use the Congress for political purposes. Any information on the situation in Cuba and on Cuban Government organizations, particularly on the incorporation of the National Cultural Council into the Ministry of Education would be appreciated. It would also be interesting to know why Cintio VITIER who was scheduled to come to the Congress did not show up. L-9 said he was willing to help but was extremely busy with his brother's edible oil business in Toluca. It would be


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 274

- difficuit for him to find time to talk with the Cuban delegates, he felt in addition, that it would be difficult for him to simply walk in on the delegates if he could not be invited, officially, to the Congress or to a social affair connected with it. Finally, L-9 pointed out that he had now been in Mexico for nearly six months, that "everyone" knew that he had no intention of returning to Cuba and that, for these reasons, the Cuban delegates to the Congress might not be anxious to talk to him. After a long "pep" talk by the undersigned and some discussion it was decided that L-9 would call the next morning on Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas who had just returned from Cuba. L-9 would pay his respects and find out if the Embassy planned some social function at which he could openly meet the Cuban delegates (he felt he might wrangle an invitation to such an affair either directly from the Ambassador or from Heberto JORRIN, the ex-Embassy portero whom he has known for years). It was further decided that L-9 would concentrate on CARPENTIER with whom he felt he had the best rapport and who was in his view the delegate with the most "bourgeois" background.

3. At a meeting held on 21 March L-9 related that he had seen Ambassador HERNANDEZ earlier that morning (the delegates to the Writer's Congress which had been held for the last few days in Guadalajara were scheduled to return the next day). He had found the Ambassador nervous and pre- occupied. The latter told him almost mechanically that

3


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 275

everything in Cuba (political and economic situation, sugar
harvest, etc) was fine. He informed L-9 that he did not
have the opportunity to see L-9's sister-in-law and that
he had given a letter, which L-9 had asked him to deliver to
her for passage to the National Cultural Council, to Marta
GONZALEZ of the International Relations Bureau of the
Council. L-9, in this letter, asked that his three month
leave from the Cultural Council be greatly extended. The
Ambassador said he ignored what reaction the Cultural
people had to his letter. He explained that the Cultural
Council is now part of a Bureau headed by Lisandro OTERO.
in the Ministry of Education. Carlos LECHUGA Hevia, the
previous head of the council has been reassigned to the Tri-
Continental conference as a member of the Secretariat of
that organization. He was replaced as the heau of the
council by fnu MUZPO, ex rector of the University of
Oriente. The Ambassador insisted that, in spite of this,
the National Cultural Council still kept some degree of
autonomy. He was rather evasive when L-9 mentioned
his desire to call on the Cuban delegates to the Writer's
Congress. He said that he did not think that a party
would be held at the Embassy for the delegates and did not
offer to put L-9 in contact with the people he wanted to
see. Since he did not seem to have gotten anywhere with the
Ambassador, the undersigned asked L-9 to call on the Congress

4


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 276

- delegates at the Del Prado Hotel where they were staying.
- L-9 seemed reluctant at first, but finally agreed to do this if he did not have any more luck in contacting the Cuban delegates some other way. L-9 proposed to visit the Embassy the next day and talk to JORR IN about the Congress. The Latter might be able to place him in contact with the Cuban visitors.
- 4. The undersigned met L-9 again on 22 March. L-9 stated that he had visited the Cuban Embassy early that day but had to wait for JORRIN who was out for about 20 minutes. The latter was too busy after his return that L-9 had only a few minutes of conversation with him. JORRIN confirmed that the Embassy would not have a party for the Congress delegates "because of the Semana Santa," and said he did not know exactly when the delegates would drop in the Embassy following their return from Guadalajara. Upon leaving JORRIN, L-9 went to the Del Prado where he was told that the Congress delegates would only return to Mexico late that day. A few blocks from the hotel L-9 ran into Nicolas GUILLEN who greeted him by saying "here is L-9 in his ambiente Mexicano." The two men walked together back to the Del Prado. GUILLEN turned down L-9's invitation for a cup of coffee saying he had to visit someone. He did mention that the Congress, as far as he was concerned, was "una basura" and told L-9 that he had flown from Guadalajara

5


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 277

- to Mexico City (he did not say why) ahead of the other Cuban delegates who were returning by road later that day.
- GUILLEN told L-9 that he would be in the same neighborhood early next day and would be glad to have coffee with him if L-9 could meet him then. Anyway, he added, he would be staying in Mexico for another two weeks at the request of the Ambassador. They could see each other again later on before he left. As they were about to cross a busy street shortly before parting, L-9 took GUILLEN by the arm in a friendly gesture. The latter pulled away and L-9 had the feeling that GUILLEN did not want to let L-9 be friendly with him.
- 5. The next meeting with L-9 was held on 24 March.
- L-9 said that he had not been able to call on the Cubans at the Del Prado until earlier that day. He had run into Licandro OTERO while in the lobby. The latter told him he was about to leave. when L-9 said "already?" OTERO pointed out that he had been in Mexico for two weeks already.
- L-9 repeated the derogatory remarks made about the Congress by GUILLEN. OTERO said that, on the contrary, this had been a successful meeting. A letter of protest had been sent to President Johnson and the Congress had taken a firm position against the "Imperialists." After relating the above, L-9 recalled that a rumor circulated in Havana, shortly before his departure from Cuba, to the effect that

6


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 278

- Marcia LEISECA, OTERO's wife (a woman of about 34 who worked at the Casa de las Americas) was about to divorce
- OTERO to marry Osmani CIENFUEGOS. L-9 added that Marcia had relatives in Mexico whom she visited in 1962 and 1965.
- After leaving OTERO, L-9 phoned CARPENTIER and was told by the latter to meet him the next day.
- 6. L-9 and CARPENTIER met for breakfast on 24 March.
- When L-9 asked him for news about the National Cultural Council, CARPENTIER said that L-9 knew certainly more about that then he did as he had been in France since last November.
- CARPENTIER claimed that he had been called in by DORTICOS last October and told that *Raudilio CASTILLANOS*, the current Cuban Ambassador in Paris had requested his nomination to the Paris Embassy as Minister Concellor. CARPENTIER said he tried to get out of this two year assignment which he found too long, but was told by DORTICOS that there was no way out of it. The Cuban Government, said DORTICOS, was out to make it's representation in Paris "an absolutely first class Embassy". DORTICOS added that CARPENTIER would not be so busy in Paris that he would not find time to write.
- Whether he found time to write CARPENTIER did not say.
- What he did say was that the Ambassador, who was doing a very good job, did an enormous amount of work and usually worked late at night. He also mentioned that while in Paris or shortly before arriving there he had gone to Hanoi

7


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 279

on an official mission. CARPENTIER gave no details
other than to say that that horrible war was probably
going to last, and that U.S. planes had flown right over
his head Juring his stay. L-9 did not press him for more
information but gathered that CARPENTIER remained in
North Vietnam two or three weeks.

7. L-9 asked why VITIER had not attended the Congress.
   CARPENTIER replied that VITIER was "in a special situation
   in Cuba" as he was not in accord with the revolution.
   He had been given the opportunity to go to Spain for the
   Cuban Government but had refused to go. VITIER undoubtedly
   knew, from the background of the delegates, that the writer's
   Congress in Mexico would be a leftist affair. CARPENTIER
   guessed that he probably declined to come because of this.
   Talking about himself, CARPENTIER said (without further
   details) that he would be going to Moscow in May. He
   announced that a film based on his novel "Los Pasos Perdidos"
   would be made this year, probably half in France and haif
   in Cuba (negotiations with the French are still going on).
   Finally, he mentioned that he was trying to convince the
   Cuban Government to create a centralized publishing depart
   ment and that as Director of the Cuban National printing
   office, before leaving Cuba, he had succeeded in getting
   some 70 million books printed. He mentioned, incidentally,

8


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 280

that his publisher in Mexico is Arnaldo ORFILA, ex director
of the Mexico City Fondo del Cultura Economica whom
CARPENTIER said he was on his way to see to collect royalties.
CARPENTIER said he would leave Mexico on 29 March via SABENA
and agreed to get together with L-9 on 27 March.

Memorandum for the Record

Subject: Meeting with LITANIL-9

9 November 1956

PER telecon on the morning of 8 November, the undersigned met with LITANIL-9 at 2100 at the Gutenberg/Thiers glorieta. L-9 was taken to the home of Geze F. BRADDOCK, where the meeting was held. The meeting lasted until 2200 on 9 Nov 66. NO SECURITY PROBLEMS NOTED.

An interesting and fantastic incident occurred on the night of 7 Nov. L-9 said he saw the undersigned walking by his apartment when for some unknown reason he got up to look out the window. The undersigned did, in fact, walk by L-9's apartment on the night of the 7th at about 2300. L-9 was, of course, very impressed with this quirk of fate as was the undersigned. Three women in time, a city of 5 million people etc. At approximately 2215, the undersigned called L-9 and a woman answered the phone. Nothing was said by the undersigned and the phone was hung up. It is possible that this call, if the number was correct, had some influence on his appearance at the window. However, L-9 made no mention of a woman at his place but said he had been reading and got up to look out.

PERSONAL PROBLEMS:

L-9 is very concerned about having lost his Mexican residence permit. REFERRED: According to L-9, the Mexican Govt took away his residence permit because he broke Mexican laws. L-9 travelled to Cuba several times without advising the proper authorities during the last several years. L-9 always travelled to Cuba as a Cuban diplomat and not as a Mexican resident therefore there was no record of his trav 1. This was obviously against the rules and L-9 has to pay for it. L-9 went to see Coty SCHWARTZ re this problem and she told him to get in touch with Ignacio "La cho" ACOSTA Lagumas. ACOSTA took L-9 to Gobernacion but he was unable to see the Oficial Mayor, GALVEZ, Inu. They talked with another official who gave them little hope. ACOSTA said he would go to see GALVEZ, himself, on the following Monday but again, he was unable to get to see GALVEZ. (Lic. Carlos GALVEZ Betancourt).

File-201-LITANIL-9


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 316

2. 
cint.

L-9 went to see Amb. Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas after ACOSTA failed to help him and HERNANDEZ told him he would talk with Ing. Jorge TAMAYO, that TAMAYO was the man who would be able to help. L-9 is pretty shook up about this problem because he was told at Gobernacion that he would have to reapply again and therefore go through the same *XXXXXX* red tape as before, i.e. five years, restricted travel etc. L-9, of course, has new hope with his contact with us but *XXXXX* he was told that only as a last resort would the U.S. get involved in order to protect the operation.

L-9 again went into the business of his brother's request and that of his friend in the business, who is financing the stuff, for him to remain in Mexico as the company's administrator. L-9 stated as he has done in the past that he is being pulled in both directions, i.e. toward Mexico by his brother etc and *XXXXX* toward Cuba by the U.S. Govt. He did not make it clear which of the two pressures he expects to succumb to. The undersigned did not push the issue at this meeting hoping to get into this matter at a later meeting.

L-9, just before he got out of the car, mentioned that he was in need of money and wanted to get spare parts etc to sent back to Cuba with Orlando SUAREZ, who is scheduled to leave for Habana on Monday. The undersigned said he would get L-9 some money for the next meeting.

L-9 was in good spirits, very proud of his files and anxious to please. HE described himself during the last year or so in Cuba as "un soldado en su puesto" ready to serve when the time came. He was pleased, of course, to have contact again with CDTKE and indicated he was a little shook up because his brother was "all over the place" and therefore not a good contact point. He was concerned about how he was going to make contact.

L-9's post with the Consejo is: Jefe de Protocolo and Liaison officer with the Foreign embassies in Habana.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 317

7. Manuel VEGA Perez - VEGA was named to his present rest in the Consejo by Carlos LECHUGA. VEGA, although not a colonel san, has a "day faced" charm about him that gets him through. I mentioned to L-9 that VEGA was formerly G-2 in Mexico and he agreed but gave little attention to this in terms of his new role.

8. Eduardo CORONA - L-9 said that the removal of CORONA from his post was looked upon very critically by members of the dip corps. CORONA, an extremely well educated and knowledgable type was replaced by Manuel VEGA Perez. CORONA, acc L-9, was removed from the post in order to give him more time to work on the new constitution. CORONA is also a proi al we v. o zapana. Iny changed CORONA's despedida address because, acc L-9, the way CORONA had written it, it looked a though CORONA had been fired. L-9 commented thusly to CORONA.

9. Carlos LECHUGA - L-9 said LECHUGA is very happy in his job and APPEARENTLY his wife is a different woman. She is very much at ease, apparently the marital problems have been solved etc. She is writing articles for "El Heraldo". LECHUGA, acc L-9 was apparently scheduled to go to Paris but CASTELLANOS went in his stead. LECHUGA was actually studying French for the job. LECHUGA comments often on the personnel who were in Mexico and are now in the CONSEJO. REELUKEX L-9, Jose Luis POSADA, Manuel VEGA, LECHUGA etc., among others.

10. Jose Luis POSADA - POSADA is inthe Consejo de Cultura and will fill in for L-9 while he is away.

11. Paul ROA Garcia - ROA is away down on the totem poleof power and has enemies throughout the govt. ROA was operated on by Dr. SAMARIA, thru for prostate trouble.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 318

3. 
L-9 stiche "jumped into" LINN-3 on the street and L-3 has been trying to talk with him. L-9 said he is somewhat embarrassei and asked about the propriety of getting in touch with him. He was told to go ahead but to merely discuss the amenities of life and not get into discussion to which he agreed heartily.

L-9 explained how he requested "leave without pay" etc through Manuel VEGA but this is spelled out in docs L-9 providei us on 3 November. Copies of all these docs re 1-9's departure, militia etc will be copied.

12. Carlos FRANQUI - L-9 knows nothing about FRANQUI but did comment that when Wilfredo LAM, colored painter, arrived in Habana for the TRICON, FRANQUI was at the airport and in an aside told LAM that he should avoid getting outspokenly involved with Marty FRA VDE because she was anti-regime.

13. Marta FRAILE - FRAILE, acc 1-9, is known to be anti-CASTRO and she makes no bones about it.

14. Fidel CASTRO - CASTRO, acc L-9, is in trouble but his security forces keep things under control. Apparently CASTRO says, according Conchita FERNANDEZ that he has to depend on his young scholarship students. He can't trust anyone else. He is obviously turning toward sugar after having turned toward industry etc. Graciela HIBER, demonstrated a bit of anti-CASTRO feeling when at 24 July fiesta the crowds applauded CASTRO. HIBER commented in a sarcastic tone: "Aplaudiran", aplaudiran". L-9 recalls that CASTRO was operated on for rectum trouble but he does not recall when. He believes Dr. RODRIGUEZ Diaz was the surgeon.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 319

4. 
PERSONALITIES

1) Teresa PRENDA - L-9 said that when PREDA left Mexico for Habana she was very unhappy and was cursing everybody. When L-9 arrived in La Habana he was told that PRENDA had been involved in "an asunto grave" with CRUCI and that she was being held. He said the latest information, about 2 months ago, is that she is under house arrest at Santa Maria del Mar, a beach resort outside Habana. Little comment is made re PRENDA in Habana.

2) Joaquin CRUCI and his wife, Edith BUTRAGUENO ie C. - OPLOCUI is still being held but his wife is allowed to go out on the street, accompanied by someone.

3) Marcia LEISECA - According to L-9, LEISECA and Lisandro OTERO are now divorced and rumors have it that LEISECA is going to marry Israni CIENFUEGOS. LEISECA, acc L-9, is an important personality, particularly in the cultural field, i.e. at the Casa de las Americas.

4. Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas - HERNANDEZ has been very friendly with L-9 since the arrival of the latter. HERNANDEZ acc L-9 is much more at ease now than when L-9 was here last. He is relaxed and sure of himself.

5. Pablo ALDAMA Acosta - ALDAMA was fired from MINREX and he was very unhappy about it. He does not have a job but is on govt payroll. ALDAMA told L-9 he was "teed off" and name Luis GOMEZ B. as the man who was getting the breaks and that GOMEZ did nothing for the revolution etc.

6. Evelio CAO Rodriguez - Acc L-9, CAO's name was brought up by Augusto AROOS, a cousin of Gustavo, when he was with Conchita FERNANDEZ XXX A. AROOS said it was known that CASTRO was going to "jump" and yet he was allowed to leave with his family for some unknown reason. A real enigma.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 320

15. Gustavo ARRS - Nothing except be arrested. Will quer again re ARCUS.

16. Mercedes MORALES Carrillo - Secion of the Casa Cuba/Mexicoia Habana. MORALES acc L-9, cut him L-3 cat of the Ye ican picutre.

17. Cec. Ferrando ROMALES - ROMALES is very close to Hilda de FRANCO in more ways than one. It is the talk of the town. In fact, it was rumored that PAMANES was going to marry Hilda PEREZ de F. He is with here frequently and in public.

18. Celia SANCHEZ - Acc L-9, SANCHEZ plans on inviting Coty STORZANO to Cuba sometime around end of year.

19. Haydee SANTAMARIA - SANTAMARIA, it is rumored, will take over Carlos LECHUGA'S post at some tine in the near future. At least, that's the rumor.

20. Agustin Guerna - GUERRA went to Spain recently with his wife, who is going blind. Acc L-9, Ir. BARRIQUE, Imu, of lare lena told PIEDRA he couldn't do a thing for his wife, and GUERRA returned. Acc GUERRA, he wanted his daughter to accompany them to Spain but the Cuban Govt would not grant permission. GUERRA is anti-CASTRO completo, but he's going to stay through it all.

21. Mariano RODRIGUEZ - RODRIGUEZ is apáinter who recently went to Rome. Casa de las Americas sugrested he go Spain, France etz to make contact with friends of Cuba but Consejo tarned the suggestiom down. It was then given to the Forieng office and they approved the travel.

22. Xicnara SANCHEZ - SANCHEZ has been fired from MINREX and she is not happy about it,

Memorandum for the Record

SUBJECT: Fidel CASTRO Ruz

22 November 1966

On 9-10 November 1966, LITAMIL-9 reported the following

re Fidel CASTRO Ruz:

a) LITAMIL-9 was not aware of any problem that CASTRO might have had during the period May-June 1966, when he failed to appear publicly. L-9 believes that he would have heard about any serious problem through "Conchita" FERNANDEZ had there been one. On this score, L-9 said that we should not pay much attention to reports that CASTRO is losing power or turning it over to the Party because, although he remains out of the limelight for a time, he bounces back bigger and more popular than ever. L-9 did recall that CASTRO was operated on by Dr. RODRIGUEZ Diaz, fnu, for a rectal problem but he believes this was in 1966.

b) CASTRO has changed his mind about voluntary labor and now feels that those assigned to the tasks given them should get the job done without voluntary assistance. L-9 believes that Celia SANCHEZ reflected this policy when she recently told "Conchita" FERNANDEZ not to volunteer her services. L-9 believes that CASTRO has recognized his folly in the case of voluntary labor and realizes now that this merely provokes his minions into creating problems in areas where they should not be, i.e. lack of personnel in times when they needed in specific job. L-9 believes Cubans are taking advantage of voluntary labor to be missing from own assigned tasks in a form of clandestine subtle sabotage operation. It is this that CASTRO is also beginning to realize.

c) CASTRO termination of militia courses per memo also shows a switch in attitude of CASTRO, who may also see counterproductive results of indoctrinating Cubans across the board. This happened about two months ago.

d)

Compañero:

Por este radio tengo el gusto de informarle que con motivo de realizar un viaje a México, en misión cultural, debidamente autorizado por el Consejo Nacional de Cultura, donde ostento el cargo de Jefe de Protocolo de la Dirección de Relaciones Internacionales; solicito de usted la debida autorización para poder llevarme algunos libros y revistas de mi propiedad, que tratan sobre pintura. Estos libros los he adquirido aquí, y se son necesarios para realizar mi trabajo como pintor. Asimismo, llevaría conmigo una máquina de escribir portátil que traje cuando vine de Méjico; en cuyo país ocupaba el cargo de Agregado Cultural de nuestra Embajada.

Deseo también llevar unos tabacos, para lo cual le estoy solicitando la autorización correspondiente.

Le adjunto la relación de los libros que deseo llevarme, notificándole que saldré del país el próximo viernes, día 7, en el vuelo No. 464, para Méjico.

INFO: DC/WH/C

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: O PBRUMEN/LIRAVINE/LITAMIL-9/Operational Progress Report

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES: Reference: HMMA-27048, Sep 65

1. LITAMIL-7 reported on 6 May 1966 that Identity A told her a few days earlier that LITAMIL-9 is well, has put on some weight, and is working hard at Identity B where he works for Identity C. This information came as a result of LITAMIL-7 having asked Identity A about how LITAMIL-9 was getting along. The general tone of Identity A's remarks about LITAMIL-9 indicated that she seems to be favorably disposed toward him.

2. The Station has had no recent contact with LITAMIL-17 who is LITAMIL-9's brother. It is assured that should he hear anything of interest concerning LITAKIL-9, he will report it promptly to the C/O.

3. It is recalled that when LITAMIL-9 left Mexico for PERUMEN in March 1965 he told his C/O he would, by hook or by crook, find some way to get back to Mexico within 23 months lest he lose his inmigrado status in Mexico. it is assumed that he is exploring every angle to make his escape and one possibility that comes to mind is that he might try to wangle a connection with the PERUMEN pavilion at the 1967 Canadian International Fair in an effort to break out. Owing to his well-known non-Communist beliefs, it would seem that he has almost no chance to secure a diplomatic assignment.

Estimado Sr.

Nos tomamos la libertad de dirigirnos a usted sobre un asunto
por el cual sentimos vivo interés.

Somos una Compañía, cuyo negocio consiste en comprar derechos,
para producir obras, presentar actores, promover y llevar ade-
lante Festivales en los cuales toman parto artistas extranjeros
e israelíes.

Por lo cual le estaríamos muy agradecidos si nos expresa su opi-
nión sobre que artistas cubanos podríamos invitar para que visi-
ten Israel y actúen aquí. Nosotros podríamos encontrar la forma
viable para intercambiar cantantes, músicos etc, y así ampliar
las Relaciones Culturales entre Israel y Cuba, algo que mucho
nos concierne.

Como para la próxima Primavera estamos planeando un Festival
Internacional de Folklore, mucho lo agradeceríamos su pronta
respuesta.

Estimado Dr. Corona:

Le ruego me excuse por mi tardanza en enviarle esta carta de agradecimiento a Ud. por el esfuerzo que realizó, e hizo posible pudiésemos tocar para su pueblo.

Aun conservamos plenamente, un vivido y feliz recuerdo del viaje. Las cajas de tabacos que Ud. no dio en el aeropuerto, fueron sumanente apreciadas por mi maestro Efren Zimbalist, quien ha sido por años un apasionado del tabaco habana.'

Para el próximo verano estamos planeando regresar al Japón, para una gira de conciertos, y la Sociedad de Amistad Japón-Cuba en Tokyo, nos ha ofr.cide organizar la gira.

Me parece que si Ud, pudiese escribir una carta de recomendación o endorsement, con las impresiones de Va. sobre nuestras actuaciones en Cuba, sería de gran valor para nosotros, para que la gira en el Japón se haga posible.

Le roganos haga llegar a su familia, nuestros más cálidos saludos y muy especialmente para Elpidio.

Confiamos en que ya Ud. sea un orgulloso abuelo.

Estabos esperando por su carta muy pronto.

Febrero 18 de 1966

Sr. Agregado Cultural
de la Embajada de Cuba
22, Lourt St.
London, W. 1

Estimado Sr.:

Estoy representando la Hutchinsons Publishing, la cual está de lo más interesada en las posibilidades de publicar traducciones de obras de poesía y ficción.

Estas traducciones aparecerán regularmente bajo una denominación - posiblemente, "The Latin American Library", y con la continuación de series como la "Library" lo desea, creemos dará una coherencia a las publicaciones de Literatura Latino-Americana, de la cual carece al presente.

Por le momento estoy tratando de recopilar tanta información como sea posible. Le estaré de lo más agradecido por cualquier ayuda que me pueda dar. Preferentemente desearía los nombres de destacados autores cubanos - clásicos y contemporáneos - títulos de las obras de ficción y de poesía, y una información que indique hasta que punto pueden ser traducidas al inglés.

Doy a Ud. las gracias anticipadas por su cortesía y ayuda.

De Ud. sinceramente,

Bernard G. Mullinger

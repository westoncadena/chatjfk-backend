Tom Howarth
Select Committee on Assassinations
3331 House Annex # 2

Dear Tom:

Here, without further delay or adue, is my repayment of the overpayment. You will note that it is made out to the U.S. Treasury or the Committee. This is due to the fact that I never recieved your note of September 15, so I was not sure who this was to be made out to. You may instruct those fine fellows at the Bayroll Department, however, that I had an exquisitely fine time with my unexpected 'manna from bureaucratic heaven'.

Also, I wish you would advise Donovan to advise Blakey's office that I am still waiting breathlessly for their letter of recommendation. Please tell him (them) that I will not be able to obtain credit for my arduous labors of the summer until I recieve some sort of recommendation.

Thus, with all the sincerety due the occasion, I am,

Sincerely,
![signature]
John J. Farmer, Jr.

P.S. Say hello to Kevin Walsh and Edwin Lopez for me. Tell Edwin that I am now a lifetime member of the "Reggie Jackson for Messiah" fan club.

Dear John:

In reference to my letter of September 15, 1977, the House Finance Office informs me that in settling your over- payment, they will adjust various withholdings, that were made from your salary.

Accordingly, the amount of the check that you send to us should be $199.38 instead of $220.00.

Sincerely,

Thomas Howarth

### U.S. House of Representatives

3331 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

September 15, 1977

Mr. John Farmer
1001 Rockville Pike, #1819
Rockville, MD 20852

Dear John:

Through an oversight, the Research Unit failed to notify the Budget Office that you had terminated your services with the Select Committee. As a consequence, you were overpaid for the month of August.

As I understand the facts, you worked through Friday, August 12 and that Mr. Gay gave you vacation through Friday, August 19. Therefore, you were overpaid for the period August 20-31, 1977 which amounts to a gross salary of $220.00.

If you agree with the facts, I must request from you in the name of the House of Representatives, the return of House funds in the amount of $220.00. The check should be made payable to the U. S. Treasury and sent to me in care of the Committee.

If you dispute the facts, kindly get in touch with me as soon as possible so that we can settle the matter.

Kind regards and good luck in your classes at school.

Sincerely,

Thomas Howarth

FROM: Donovan L. Gay

RE: John Farmer

Early August, 1977, John Farmer, The Committee's summer intern, informed me that he would be registering for classes on August 26, 1977, and would like some time off commencing August 15, 1977, so he could vacation with his family for two weeks.

Based on the countless hours he devoted, and on John's overall performance, which was exceptional, I took it upon myself to grant him the week of August 14, 1977 to accommodate his vacation plans. Therefore, he should have been taken off our payroll ending August 20, 1977.

However, I erred in failing to notify you earlier on the above, as I thought I had already done. Therefore, John Farmer was in fact paid for the remainder of the month of August, 1977.

Should there be additional questions on this matter, please contact me immediately. Furthermore, I can assure you that in the future, you will be notified immediately with regard to personnel changes.

Thank you.

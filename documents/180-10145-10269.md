1.  Memo dated 24 Oct 1962 to Chief, Contact Division, from Chief, San
    Francisco Office

Subject: Suitability of Manuel Ray and Miro Cardona for Important
Roles in a Possible New Cuban Government

Information received from Dr. Robert North Professor of Political Science
at Stanford University anu long-time source of exceptional value. North
visited in Miami and contacted about 25 former Castro supporters representing
a broad political gamut. Dr. North got the impression from many of the
Cubans that they suspectea Ray of being a "possible Communist sleeper".
North Treluctant to pass along this information, because accusations were
very broad.

2.  Infomation report dated 16 July 1962 and Earlier

Source: Cuban National (Alien File A-12570921) who asked for an
interview on occasion of first contact with CIA.

Cannot vouch for his bona fides. Had credential indicating membership in
branch of revolutionary army's intelligence service, now in exile in U.S.
and maintaing connections with colleagues in that country.

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.
To be done by poison "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless,
and tasteless. Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5cc would do the job.
Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country
dinner in honor of the occasion should bring together most of the important
members of the regime and that is when the attempt will be made.

2.  Cable dated Oct. 3, 1961 WA CITE NYOR 4902 Support (Travis) info L/A

Branch from Daniels. Source is Ernesto Dezaldo Cuban lawyer now
living in New York City. Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than
under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent
months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro
regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations
in Havana. Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000 succesS
measured more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.

3.  Information dated June 4, 1961, Subject: Underground Student Leader
    Comments on Post-invasion Cuba. Reporting officer talked with
    ISIDRO BORJA, on the leaders of DRE. Borja says top DRE members in jail
    or in a friendly embassy in Havana but said new leaders have been selected
    and will resume sabotage activities shortly. Thought the underground could
    restore tension in Cuba in 3-4 months. However, said outside help needed
    to get rid of Castro. Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to
    buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials they were tainted by
    corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is
    estimated to be around 30-85%. Most support is out of fear because the
    people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of
    Cuba working hard for release of former leader, Alberto Muller from prison.

Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes NY Times publicity
buildup for Ray in full swing. Tad Szulc reporting Ray's war movements from
Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Henry Raymont of the Times.
Hendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez
Menoyo. Think's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly
trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's "war" is little more than an
MGM-type New York Times production so far.

1. Cable suggests that an offer of financial assistance to Ray's wife and children from CIA rather than through the FRD may pay large future dividends. Family to arrive circa September 1960.

2. Cable to Director

From: MASH

19 September 1960

Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY. Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of Cuba, but should be noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with no apparent difficulties.

CHIBAS' sources of information:

Mason in U. S. government

Manuel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives

Nino Diaz as Alianza representative

Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandex representative.

This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.

3. Summer 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member. CIA considered him an important political asset. RAUL CHIBAS, Ray's assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to Ray and would check with him.

4. 27 September 1960.

Subject: Approval from State to Include Manuel Ray Rivero in the FRD Complex

At a 20 September 1960 meeting, Ray's name was suggested for inclusion in FRD and State desired to look further into his background. Ray was discussed again on 9/27/60 with Mr. Divine who further conferred with Ambassador Mallory same day and Mallory approved Ray's inclusion.

5. September 29, 1960 cable from MASH to WH9 indicates MASH somewhat doubtful about Ray's feelings toward U.S. and continued dealings with this group needs further policy consideration.

a. MAJOR WILLIAM MORGAN had been very helpful to MRP - responsible
for obtaining most of their weapons.

b. In four months, MRP will have 20,000 militants throughout Cuba.

Gonzales considers Ray highly dangerous because of his ambition to play
prominent role in Cuban government after overthrow of Castro. Thinks he
poises threat to Varona's authority inside Cuba. Ray appears to have

    Ray to surface at press conference scheduled for 11/16/60 in Miami.

15. 11/17/60 Cable to Director from MASH
    On 11/15/60, *Parlett* alias Bender met with Ray in complete privacy. "Unquestionably, the youthful, softspoken, unassuming, almost humbe Ray is a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion." Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is concerned.

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1940 constitution. Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would be established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed at beginning of his regime to be promulgated. State would regulate private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -- each member to have specific responsibilities and feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made commitment.

*Parlett* believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD. Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is problematical.

16. 11/21/60 Memo for Record
    Subject: Meeting with King and Esterline on subject of handling MRP, 11/18/60

Consensus was that Ray did not politically represent anything to cheer about. Writer felt MRP opposed to joining FRD and recognized need to control MRP and wean it away to the extent possible from its leaders. Could be done by controlling financial and military support. It was agreed in meeting with Mr. Barnes that financial and military support for MRP be channelled through FRD.

17. 11/23/60 Contact Report: Meeting with Ray and Chibas in NYC, 11/22/60
    Ray says MRP has contacts at Isle of Pines with two garrisons and can expect about 750 men to desert Castro at proper time. CAPTAIN CAPOTA is contact with Ray's group.

Ray's people also in contact with commander of prison where Huber Matos is incarcerated. Matos believes PADILLA, the prison commander, would assist

him in an escape. Ray interested in single operation to get military
defectors and free Matos. Wants to effect plan on 11/27/60.

Ray wants assistance from U.S. -- military information and supplies.

18. 11/24/60 Cable to Director from JMASH
    Meeting with AMCHIRP-1 on 11/23, revealed he had information that MRP in
    Havana had capabilities to blow up power plant and TV stations in Havana --
    a diversionary tactic planned to coordinate with Isle of Pines operation.
    Ray expects Isle of Pines operation support about 12/15/60.

Notation about Cable: "Operation Unity" is to create dramatic show which
will demonstrate that Manolo Ray is wrong when telling contacts in U.S.
that his group is the only one capable of action."

19. 11/24/60 Cable to Director from Havana.
    Operation Unity involves MRR, MDI, OA, 30th of November Group and MAR (not
    MAR of PEPIN RIVERO).

MAR and OA groups to blow electric cables in Regla area. MDC group, at
same time, to make assassination attempt on CARLOS RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ at
University of Havana.

20. 11/30/60 Cable to Director from Havana

landed somewhere on Keys in a fishing boat, made way to road where picked
up by INS patrol car, taken to WAVE area, examined, declared refugge and
released with admonition to always keep INS advised of his address.

5.  Memo to S - Dr. Berle, From: ARA - Philip W. Bonsal
    Subject: Recent Cuban Developments
    Date: March 16, 1961

Conversation with Jose Miro Cardona and Berle, reveals that Cardona has
misgivings about Ray and Pazoz and the MRP. Says Ray is bitterly anti-
American as well as probably totalitarian in his thinking. He no longer
believes Ray has any considerable support inside Cuba. Thinks Ray group
endeavoring to exercise influence in our government so as to be the major
recipient of whatever assistance can be obtained here. He is particularly
concerned about the role played by Felipe Pazos.

6. Field Information Report
   Subject: Background, Character and Economic Concepts of Manuel Ray Rivero
   Date: 16 March 1961
   Sources: Dr. Oscar SALAS Marrero (paragraphs 1-11) Knew Ray in Cuba
   Dr. Jose ALVAREZ Diaz, former Minister of Finance under Prio (Pg 12)
   Dr. Jorge BERUFF, former president of Banco de Desarrollo
   Economico de Cuba, (pg 13)

Note: Cover note pencilled comment (The content is so biased and mixed with untruth that it would be a disservice to the intelligence community to disseminate it.

Synopsis of paragraphs 1-11. Dr. Salas says during his childhood Ray was a Protestant but today is completely atheistic. Said Ray organized the MRC against Batista and shortly after Batista's fall, MRC and 26th of July Movement fused into one, and as soon as Castro came into power, control of the organization was given to the Communists. Tells of Ray's association with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his own brother was renounced by Castro. Stated that Ray's rupture with Fidel was due to the fact that Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations. Says in Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own movement.

Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Ray was in favor of maintaining relations with USSR and not making Communist Party illegal. Said that although Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press coverage, Alvarez thinks they are representative of Ray's thinking and would try to put ideas into practive if he ever came to power. Alverez also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services, socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.

Synopsis of paragraph 13. Dr. Beruff said Ray well-intentioned with no Communist tendencies. Cited a meeting at which the basic points of the MRP platform were discussed and said that since Ray was in disagreement with the others on most of the points, Dr. Felipe Pazos acted as chairman of the meeting and Ray argued his case as a simple member of the group. Out of this meeting came a declaration of 14 points, including the nationalization of the banks and public utilities.

On 9 March, Ray said that ideas attributed to him in paragraph 12 were not true and part of a "campaign against him by Mr. Pawley of the Miami City Transit Company".

   Subject: Manolo Ray - Comments on his Anti-Castro Activities
   Signed: Calvin Hicks WH/4/PM/Operations

"Ray is balieved to have accomplished pratically nothing towards the effort to overthow Castro. Instead, it seems that whenever we played with his so- called assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or operations, several days after some other group had already set them up or claimed them. Whenever it came to producing and backing up his claims, he always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has always tended to try to take over other goups, rather than cooperate with them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against them. His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power in Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo RAY is so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous (or more so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro, if he ever got to be the power in Cuba."

1.  Cable to JMWAVE from Director
    Date: August 1, 1961

FBI conducting investigation on MRP and Ray and Director indicates he needs to know purpose of investigation to respond properly.

2.  Dispatch from Chief of Base, JMWAVE
    Date: August 4, 1961
    Subject: Debriefing of Father Bastarrica

Father Bastarrica recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile. At a luncheon meeting, he reported as follows:

MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amalio Fiallo Gonzalez, Dr. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera. All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica. The name of MRP was suggested by Raul Chibas and in itself it does not constitute a party or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the following:

a. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray
b. Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Fiallo
c. Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet
d. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)
e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos
f. Dr. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Embassy of Peru and belonged to Accion Democratica.

Father Bastarrica's opinion of Ray is that he had no way of judging whether Ray is Communist or Marxist. Lacks quality of leadership because he does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic ideology. He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a very dangerous man. Is extremely ambitous for himself, with great desire for power.

3.  Memorandum for Chief, WH Division, dated 10 October 1961, from Warren S. Yauger, Subject: General - Cuban Matters; Specific - Manuel (Monolo) Ray
    Planning Board of Puerto Rico announced on 9 October 1961 that Ray has accepted position as consultant to that Board. Board is an important agency of Puerto Rican government, attached to the Office of the Governor. Has broad powers over economic and social planning and is active in exercising these powers. Ray to receive $12,000 per year. Ray presently in Venezuela but expected to arrive Puerto Rico within a week.

Ray's new organization is not to be military or engage in military thrusts against Cuba because military activity is presently controlled by the Agency and cannot be wrested from it at this time.

Met with Ray in N.Y.C. on 19 August. Rodriguez recommends to Ted Shackley
that ammunition for JURE be cached near Florida Keys. Thinks it necessary
to help Ray this much in order to measure his capabilities. Ray is having
a 25-foot boat outfitted in Miami area to be operational by about Sept. 10.
Will be used primarily for infiltration and exfiltration of personnel into
Cuba. Ray also says he has been offered a 210 ft. Corvette, flying a
Venezuelan flag and owned by Spaniards friendly to JURE. Said he could extend
operations along the south coast of Cuba for as much as 2 3 weeks with
this vessel. Ray was interested in whether or not KIM flights were to be
resumed into Cuba as he is hopeful of returning by legal means which would
not pose as many difficulties as present Mexican and Spanish air travel
conditions.

Ray says he hoped to soon penetrate the Cuban delegation to the U.N.
Said his contact with Ambassador Lechuga, through a woman member of the
JURE, continues, but without significant progress. Lechuga is most
friendly towards her but does not wish to discuss any of his problems with
her.

Rodriquez recommends continuation of monthly $10,000 payments to Jure and

Garcia believes that in order to obtain Franqui's defection, Ray told him about alleged plans of U.S. to overthrow Castro in which Ray was to play a prominent part. Garcia further believes that Franqui's "falling into disgrace" in Cuba is a trick of Castro and Franqui.

4. Cable to DIR from JMWAVE, dated 8 January 1964 states that Governor Munoz Marin, Puerto Rico, pledged to give Ray double any amount Ray raised on a bond sale by JURE to buy guns. JURE has large quantity of arms in P.R. under protection of the Governor.

6. Cable to DIR from JMWAVE, dtd 16 Jan 1964 - Amtaup/2 reported that Julio Cesar Alonso replaced as chief of Costa Rican military base of JURE because of his failure to go on a scheduled operation. (Check to see if this was the aborted mission of 25 November 1963)

WAVE believes the C-3 explosive found in cache was provided Ray by WAVE as directed by Hdqtrs, but WAVE did not provide any weapons.

   Subject: Meeting with AMBANG/1

ELC, according to Ray, was now disolved and became a part of JURE on 17 Jan. 1964. This brings to JURE the best former rebel army officers in exile and- should give JURE a military background and support second to none in the exile community.

Comments: AMTAUP/2 reports have indicated Cisneros activities and statements are directed against the CIA. Rodriguez discusses Amtaup/2's reporting with Tony Sforza and Warren Frank. If Cisneros is in fact directing a program of denigration against the CIA, suggest agency follow the activities of Dionisio Suarez Esquival, who reportedly has been selected to carry out such a program in various Latin American univerities.

10. Cable to DIR from Panama City, dated 22 Feb. 1964. The PUENTE BLANCO brothers have been under some suspicion since their arrival in RACY following their release from Cuban prison as result of intervention of Thelma King.

Origin of Autonomous Operations

Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher Authority in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups to supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action. Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter Rostow's proposal for a "Track Two" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-controlled Cuban teams, CIA would extend financial aid and some advice and guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1963 program.

1.  "It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime must be accomplished by Cubans, both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.
2.  The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted, they cannot be resumed.
3.  All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory of the United States.
4.  The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may be the reports of U. S. complicity.
5.  The United States presence and direct participation in the operation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into an operational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make it clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except to counter intervention by the Soviets. An experienced CIA officer would be assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support. He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.
6.  These operations would not be undertaken within a fixed time schedule."

   JURE matters have been generally reliable."

2. Autonomous Operations - Operating Plan
   Activity: AMBANG
   For the Period: 1 October - 31 December 1964. Total of $75,000 paid
   to effect move of JURE activities from U.S. territory and as a final payment
   to JURE.

3. Intelligence Information Cable, dtd 9 Sept 1964
   Source: Jose Garcia Valdez, aka "Pepe Gatillo"
   Subject: Plans of JURE leader Manuel Ray Rivero to depart Miami for an
   Undisclosed Location.

   Ray asked Garcia on 9 Sept 64 to take him, St. George and Mirta Borras on
   trip to unspecified destination. To depart on JURE catamaran.

4. Memo for the Record, dtd 11 Sept 1964 from Alfonso Rodreguez

   On Aug 24, 1964, Rogelio Cisneros called to report his resignation from JURE.
   Stated Ray incapable of directing both political and military activities.
   Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not
   prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had
   believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba. "Ray is politically
   unformed --- politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated
   that he believed Ray had planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle with President
   Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to
   him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding liberal and democractic
   exile group with the thought that prior to the 1964 elections, Mr. Kennedy
   would have to do something about Cuba. With Kennedy's death, according to
   Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros
   that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got
   idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of JURE.

5. Memo for the Record - draft dtd 22 Sept 1964 Alfonso Rodriguez
   Conclusions "I recommend we give Ray what he asks and close the JURE books
   for good. If Ray is succesful in Cuba he will not need our help, if he is
   not, our help won't do much good.

   "He is honest and at least the money will largely be spent for the
   purpose he wants to achief.

   "Whatever Ray may ever say, he was treated the way he asked to be
   treated. We have played the game in a manner beyond reproach."

Please pass to Asst. Sec. Mann from Ambassador Telles: "I saw President
Orlich and Minister Quiros Sasso on 18 November and conveyed reference position.
The President was visibly shaken to learn that US government was not in-
volved in this arms shipment. After some discussion with Minister Quiros,
President Orlich requested that we not issue license for AMBANG-1 shipment.
President Orlich made clear he would be happy at any time to undertake
action such as this if US government wanted him to. While he does wish
see Cuba free he inclined to agree with US position Re Hit and Run raids
undertaken principally for publicity sake. President Orlich's decision
based on (1) relaization that he would not be doing us a favor and, (2)
further realization that CRG would be hard pressed to explain such a
$70,000 purchase of arms if it became a campaign issue in 1965."

    From: Deputy Director for Plans
    Subject: Ray, Rivero, Manuel Antonio aka: Ray, Manolo

In response to a telephonic request of 15 Nov. 1965 for a name trace
on Ray. CIA files contain voluminous information from sources of
varying reliability re: Ray who is well known to Intelligence Community
as a prominent anti-Castro Cuban exile leader and head of JURE. If par-
ticular info is desired, please specify.

2.  Memo dtd 6 Dec 1965 to Secret Service from DD/P gives 2 1/2 page
    standard bio information on Ray.

3.  Memo dtd 15 Dec 1965 to Commissioner, INS from DD/P
    Subject: Roige Cerezo, Jose
    (A 12 399 923 TC)

According to CIA files, information dtd Aug 1963 from a Cuban emigree source,
Roige was designated chief of intelligence by National Direction Abroad of
JURE. Source said intelligence group created in Marc 1963 on orders of
Manuel Ray for purpose of infiltrating JURE members into various organizations
which operated in Miami area, as well as into agencies of U.S. govt. Further,
that in April 1963, Ray had issued orders to infiltrate a JURE member into CIA
in order to learn details of plans regarding Cuba. JURE also intended to
drop leaflets into Cuba of a derogatory nature regarding U.S. govt. In-
cluded in these leaflets was Subject's manifesto against the U.S. govt and
against this Agency.

4.  Ltr. dtd June 2, 1966 from Dr. Julian Gallo to Harry (Mahoney?)

Gallo is contact with Ray in Puerto Rico and trying to discover the names
of Ray's contacts in Cuba. Ray, apparently is seeking a Mexican visa from
Gallo and unhappy that it did not come through. Refused to reveal names
or addresses to Gallo and would not give information about where his radio
broadcast tapes were to be sent for transmission into Cuba.

5.  Memo for the Record, dtd 21 June 1966 from Charles Anderson

Met with Ray on 28 April 1966. Anderson said in general Ray had less
information on the "purge situation that I did.! Ray said relatives
of Gustavo Arcos in P.R. had telephone contact with Arcos family in Cuba,
about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him
were thin. "(This means there was at least one more telephone call than
we knew of previously, and this has probably served to increase the pressure
on Arcos)." Anderson tells of his concern and strong interest in Arcos on
the chance that Ray might assume Arcos had been CIA agent. Doesn't know
if Ray will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use
an important exile channel as a possible deception mechanism."

"I believe that later in the summer it might be a good idea to have
another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exile thinking, and feeding more
deception thoughts."

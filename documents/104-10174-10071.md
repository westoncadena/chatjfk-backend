# OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES
630 FIFTH AVENUE
NEW YORK. N. Y.

November 14, 1944

By Courier

Colonel William J. Donovan
Office of Strategic Services
Washington, D. C.

Dear Colonel:

You may have heard already about Mrs. Luce's campaign of political warfare in respect of the British Empire, but it is so interesting and so relevant to our operations that I am taking a chance on boring you with a repetition.

Then Mrs. Luce went to the Middle East some time ago. She had an interview with Auchinleck, among others, and obtained from him some extremely important and profoundly confidential information. According to one account, she even learned the date on which the British offensive in North Africa was due to begin. She wrote this information down in her notebooks – and also inscribed her opinion of Auchinleck and of the British Administration in that part of the world and elsewhere, all of this in extremely uncomplimentary terms.

Previous to her return to America, she persuaded Mention to put her notes under some kind of an official British seal with the idea that this would clear them without inspection through any British posts she might be passing on her way home. In addition to these notes under seal, Mrs. Luce also had further notes in her possession which she wrote after the earlier material was sealed. When she arrived at the British censorship in Trinidad, a British official looked through her trunkated papers and found among them the notes in which she had expressed herself with considerable feeling on the British. The official was moved by this discovery to break the seal which London had placed on the earlier material and seal that too. Mrs. Luce felt very strongly about this action, and protested with great feeling, but the official at Trinidad has not deterred.

So grave a view was taken in Trinidad of Mrs. Luce's notes, and most particularly of the information she had obtained from Auchinleck, that all the papers were sent to London. According to one version, they even went to Mr. Churchill himself. They were then sent to Washington – apparently to the White House. It was only after these several examinations that they were returned to Mrs. Luce.

This history is supposed to explain the disciplinary action taken against both Mention and Auchinleck some time ago, and it's firmly believed, in at least some quarters that Mrs. Luce's experience was not altogether unconnected with the “Open Letter” to the British people recently published in Life Magazine.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 4

Shortly after Mrs. Luce's return to this country, she spoke at an off-the-record meeting of the Overseas Press Club in Washington about her travels and took a very strongly anti-British-is position. The meeting was rather less informal, and the atmosphere was here was friendly to her, so there seems to be no person to suppose that she was provoked into saying anything she did not really mean. Among other things, she said at this meeting that the Suez Canal should be turned over to the Egyptians.

"Then do you think this should be done?" she was asked.

"Right now," she replied.

"Does that go for the Panama Canal too—do you think that ought to be given back to Panama—?" another correspondent present asked.

"Yes," Mrs. Luce replied. "It goes for Panama too."

I cannot guarantee this account of the latest stages in Mrs. Luce's political career, but it comes from extremely well informed and sober minded persons who wrote without prejudice.

Hope to see you again soon.

All the best.

Yours,

Wallie Deuel

MEMORANDUM

TO Colonel William J. Donovan.

FROM Edward S. Mason

SUBJECT J.I.C. Sub-Committee Meeting, May 12, 1942 (H.W. Hostow attending)

The Sub-Committee is undertaking three new papers:

German Manpower Losses

French Capabilities as an Active Axis Ally

Russian Capabilities

The first paper is assigned to COI for preparation. Responsibility for the preparation on Russian Capabilities is also assigned to this office, it being understood that the military section on the Western front will be undertaken with the cooperation of Colonel Montague and that the military aspects of the Siberian area will be covered by Commander Kennoy. A-Sub-Committee consisting of Commander Foskett, Dr. Hornbeck, Col. Meloy and Col. Fortier will, undertake the preparation of the paper on French Capabilities as an Active Axis Ally.

Mrs. Clare Luce then addressed the meeting and a report of her remarks is appended.

# COORDINATOR OF INFORMATION

J.I.C. ccting, May 12, 1982 - Statement of irs. Claro Lice

## I Background

Mrs. Luce travelled to the Middle and Far east via the Trans-african ferry route, visiting Dung, India, and the Middle East. She had extensive opportunities for formal and informal conversation with the major military and political figures, as well as various operating airmen, soldiers, and correspondents. She carefully distinguished the quality of her sources, indicating where her views were based on observed facts, official statements, or gossip.

## II Burma and China

Mrs. Luce arrived at Lashio at the time of the visit of Chiang and Madame Chiang. Their intervention was required not only to facilitate cooperation between the British and General Stillwell's Chinese forces, but also to enforce discipline on the Chinese generals nominally under Stillwell. It was rumored that a major opportunity to defeat the Japanese was lost at Tongou duo to the unwillingness of the Chinese generals to obey Stillwell and attack. The arrival of the Chiangs was immediately known to the Japanese who bombed the headquarters area for the first time in force. Mandalay, which Mrs. Luce saw immediately after the main bombing attack early in April, was leveled and deserted, with two to five thousand dead left in the ruins.

In a long-conversation with Madame Chiang great bitterness was expressed against the British. Madame Chiang went back to Hong Kong, the Treaty Forts, and the opium war, ending up with Wavell's failure to accept Chinese assistance in Burma. Madame Chiang indicated, however, that she would not accept a negotiated peace under any circumstances with the Japanese, recalling the Japanese occupation of Nanking. Under questioning Mrs. Luce stated that she did not believe the Japanese would move in force against China. All Intelligence sources in Chunking believe that the Japanese will move against Russia before June of this year. As for India Mrs. Luce stated that a full-fledged invasion by land forces seemed unlikely in the immediate future, but that bombing attacks on the Calcutta area were very likely -- these designed to exploit the political instability there and the concentration of Indian industrial strength.

In general Mrs. Luce believes that the British in Burma fought as well as their resources permitted. The R.A.F. was bombed out of Magwe early, leaving the main operations without air protection. The British claim that their radio directional finders were sabotaged by the Burmese Fifth Column; elsewhere gossip stated that the finders had been withdrawn prior to the Japanese attack. The one hundred British tanks proved ineffective as the main highway, on which they could operate, was flanked by forests through which the Japanese filtered. The presence of American technicians in the Burma oil fields probably guaranteed thorough destruction. Elsewhere there was "no earth worth scorching". The British General Alexander expressed the general belief that the failure in Burma was, in the long run, unimportant; that after the defeat of Hitler the Japanese could easily be


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

ariven out. This blandness seened to characterize-the view of almost
all Britishers in the Far East, although the vicercy of India expressed
regret that, for the sake of the Indians, British control in India would
"not survive another fifty years".

lirs. Luce visited the headquarters of the A.V.G.. She expressed the
hope that they would not be kept alive as a unit, but that their experience
in fighting Japanese planes would be transferred to American pilots in
training, especially at Karachi. She felt that neither the A.V.G. nor General
Stillwell should return to China, despite their obvious value in maintaining
and American link ami american prestige. General Stillwell has apparently
cist nguished himself, under nost trying circumsta.ces, by his comradeship
with the Chinese and his willingness to share front-line cangers and hard-
ships. At a time when the Chinese are extremely sensitive, General Still-
well's attitudo and action were of great importance.

### India

Indian morale is extremely low, lover in fact than before the Cripps
Mission. The net result of the Mission appears merely to have strengthened
Gandhi and the policy of passive resistance. Mrs. Luce believes, however,
that, in a short run at least, there is nothing wrong with the morale of
the Indians and the Chinese that could not be corrected by a couple of
substantial victories. Tavell, in a letter to rs. Luce éxpressed himself
as more concerned about I dian norele and possible military consequences
of that situation, than with the strictly military aspects of defense.
rs. Luce spoke very highly of General Brereton as a member "of that new
race, the air man". It is Brereton's view that no important action should.
be taken by the air force under his command until they are in a position
of local superiority; he did, however, "lear a little", by bombing the Andaman
Islands and Kangoon. Ers. Luce believes that a first-line air force main-
tained at 300 planes in India could defeat the Japanese in any move in thet
direction.

### Middle Fast

General Faxwell is reported to be extremely popular in the Middle
East; while General Adler was unpopular, possibly due to his forthrightness
in criticising the British methods. ars. Luce visited the most advanced
tank station in the British controlled desert area. She found numerous
complaints, not specified, about American equipment. In general, however,
she holds that the British have cone a good job in the desert.

The British in Cairo have had extensive and chronic difficulties with
their various allies. A Jugoslav revolution alnost took place in Cairo
while she was there. The Poles, Jugoslavs and French appear unwilling to
enter British air units but hold out for independent air squadrons. The
one hundred thousand Foles, "dunged across the border by Russia" were
reported by gossip to have been turned down by wavell and Auchinlech,
successively, and then shipped to Britain. Mrs. Luce stated that the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 16

-3-

British have been propped by their own propaganda on behalf of their minor allies; and that the allies now overestimate their contribution to the waveffort and steadily make trouble.

The biggest problem, however, throughout Africa and the Middle East, is that of inducing a shorter turn around for shipping. At every port the complaint is the same, to blaze bein distributed between British administrators and the American Maritime Unions. The flow of planes over the Trans-African route was, at the time of Mrs. Luce's passage, very thin. She reported heavy fighter plane losses by crack-up; and a total lack of preparedness against air attack (in Liberia, Takorodi, Lagos, Fort Lazy, etc.).

Mrs, Luce passed along a statement from a Free French administrator in Lagos that extensive air preparations are under way in morocco; and she quoted Purry Jester, American Consul at Lagos, now in the United States, as believing that it would still be possible to win over various Vichy agents and territories in West Africa.

Report by Mr. Jester, Consul at Lagos

May 5, 1942

In the early part of April the attached abstract of file 1896 (accessioned about April 1) was prepared at the request of Wr. Shapiro. There subsequently came to the attention of the African Section the attached memorandum to Colonel Donovan from 4. iabel on the same subject. It could appear that (1) Colonel Donovan must have seen riabel's memorandum of March 12 already and (2) that the present abstract of file 1896 13 now possibly inappropriate.

Lest this very important matter may have become sidetracked or aislaid through some accident of routine, I send you herewith all the pertinent data of which I have knowledge.

# ABSTRACT OF ELLE 1896

Subjects Report of Perry N. Jester re Organization of Consular Service in West Africa

To: Prank Vauran

1. Mr. Kauran believes that "American activities (presumably all activities besides shipping) must be coordinated."

2. Mr. Jester believes his reports and recommendations to the State Department are filed without adecuate tudy.

3. Hr. Jestor remarks that "one of our most important and urgent needs....is a better set up of our consular representation (in host Africa)". He is "firaly conviced" thets

a. The Lagos office should be a Consulate-General.

b. That other consular representatives in British West Aprica should report through and coordinate with the Lagos office.

c. That independently reporting consuls at other posts in British best Africa should not be appointed.

d. That the Consul General should be a ranking Foreirn Service Officer (of Class 4) middle-aged and experienced.

e. That the U. 5. Consular organization in Best Africa should be set up in accord with the controlling economic and political factors on the coast.

f. That the best organization would be as follows:

Laos Consul General (to be concerned with "larger issues of our over-all policy, our trade policy, our relations with west Arrican governments, the effect of British Colonial policy on our interests and the relations (in cooperation ith an independent American Consultar) of British and ?rench colonies and policies.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

2. 
Two Consular officers (to be concerned with Nigerian problems alone.)

Accra - Che Consul (to be concerned with Gold Coast problems, Accra being the military center or P.W.A. and of importance principally for the shipment of bauxite, mahogany and manganese).

Freetown - One Consular Agent (because of the Naval importance of Freetown).

Bathurst - One Consular Agent (because of the importance of this point to air communications). This would be welcomed by the Governor of Gambia.

These recommendations and opinions and the irregular method used of bringing them to attention are arrived at from a consideration of the following points:

a. Mr. Jester has no personal interest since his tour of West Africa is almost finished.

b. Lagos is the political and economic center of British West Africa with a larger territory, larger population, and larger commerce than any other colony.

PHONED SHUB

Lou Scherer (3) phoned to say that he had to see Levites, editor of *New Leader*, in connection with a new project, and with several other matters. Could like to see him for about an hour. CSF had suggested I ask Doris Shub to arrange the appointment.

I phoned Boris Shub, and phoned Scherer back that Shub would meet him at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow in the bookstore below (?) the IL office at 7 E. 15 St. Shub will introduce Scherer to Levitas at 11.

Re PICTO BOOK

Boris said there are 3 matters which *we can live without*, but it would distinctly strengthen the book if you could perhaps get them at the Library of Congress,

1.  It is conceivable that there exist photos of crowds being fired upon in Nov.-Jan. 1918-1919, in connection with rioting on the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. (See Shub's *Lenin*).
2.  Fighting in Moscow, Nov. 1917 (There was no fighting in Petersburg).
3.  Collectivization. Some think it is conceivable there exist photos of peasants being shipped north to Siberia during Collectivization. Cf. CIA Graphics? Cf. Library of Congress.

PO RUSSIANS AS ALLIES

Boris has just heard from a Russian friend, and has sent to London for confirmation -seen nothing in the papers about it here- that there has been formed in London a BRITISH SOCIETY FOR A FREE RUSSIA, with Major Hilton (author and ex-military attache in Moscow) as president and the Duchess of Atholl as vice-president. Encouraging, he thought.

He also mentioned the FREEDOM UNION FOR GERMAN-RUSSIAN FRIENDSHIP reported in the May 11 NY Herald-Trib, with Mayor Houtor and some Russians among the members.

DICK

Our man "can Like without, but it would help greatly to tie the book together,"

1917-
(1) Photos of crowds being fired upon during rioting, Nov.-Jan. 1918, in connection with the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.

Page 282 of Lenin by David Smib says: "The Assembly was scheduled to open on the morning of January 16, 1918. In anticipation of the long-awaited event, Lenin ordered a detachment of Lettish sharpshooters to PETROGRAD (St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, might be listed under any one of these names in Graphics files?).

(2) Fighting in Moscow, Nov. 1917. (There was no fighting in Petrograd, he says).

(3) Photos of peasants being shipped north to Siberia during Collectivization. Some think it "conceivable" they may exist. That would be around 1932, 1931 I guess.

He suggests trying:

1. CIA Graphics, Bldg 14. (Mr. Kessinger, used to be ex-2657, H. Beattie too).

2. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

You could ask Chuck Vettor whether he could arrange for you, without too much trouble to get into the place and borrow any photos they have, in the name of CIA, for a month or a couple of weeks (longer, if possible of course) for our man to make copies of.

I think it really would improve the book if you could get #(1) for them.

Many thanks.

RE "STALIN" PHOTO ROCK

(also KIEUNNY "Communist Zoo)

SDS saw LEMSON from 11 to 12.40

A thorough review of the whole set-up. Munson stressed two points:

(1) "The book must be locked up by July 1." Otherwise it couldn't be printed in September. And in that case it might be necessary to wait till about next March.

(2) "It must be the sort of book that Doubleday might be putting out." Firstly, because if it is too propagandistic the retailers just won't handle it (of details re C.Zoo). Secondly, Swen is still secure, stands up well under Dun & Bradstreet examination, and has been a great success in the FE. It has the NY reputation of a Far Eastern firm which does unusual things in the US. Swen as a going concern is more important than any one book: the book shouldn't be allowed to jeopardize Swen by being too obviously propaganda."

I returned the layout to him. (He has not seen the text either, nor I think the other 60-old pages). He doesn't plan to tell Shub we've seen it. He recommended that we give Shub another week to continue on it. Then that, about Monday, May 28, Sims and/or Bryan go down to MY for 2 or 3 days and work with Shub on it.

NB: He said that, later, it might be possible for Shub to introduce me to his collaborator as an informal consultant when he'd called in. In other words, in attempting to sell our views of it to Shub, we have also the problem of whether Shub could sell them in turn to his collaborator. *and Security.*

We both gave our views of the book at length.

Lyle's views included: that with the text it may be better than it looks; that theress 66 pages to come; that it is better to get out something than nothing; that we can always do a 2nd or revised version; that we must face facts and not put out a book which a high percentage of retailers simply won't handle; He also, at the start, said something along the lines of what I regard as Shubian erroneous doctrine: that we should show the responsibility that the USA and Germany (Hitler?) had for the state of affairs in the USSR; I said all such things might be sub-themes, if they could be tucked in without detracting from the main themes, but that I thought they were very dubious: 172 pages don't enuf to show what a bad man and regime it is.

My views, agreeing with much he had said, included: that we ought to put out something that the man in the barber-shop, anywhere in the world, would leaf through and couldn't turn over more than 3 or 4 consecutive pages without beginning to think: "This really must be *a bad man,* *killing* that many of his own cabinet."

That we should not attempt either an exhaustive or even consecutive chronological treatment of the 71 years since 1879 or even since 1905 or 1917. Just hammer home main points, such as that they had a Constituent Assembly, until lenin killed it by force and fraud, etc.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

That the main themes should be such as: SECRET

He kilis & kills & kilis
He lies & lies & lies
They defect & defect & defect
The worshippers return disillusioned, in droves
The top CP men get liquidated as soon as Stalin takes over, in:
Bulgaria
Hungary
Czechoslovakia (Clementis trial coming up), eta ete

That what we should include is the things that differentiate them from us,
after everything that can be said against us has been said: The things they
DO DO, that we don't do..

That we are putting ourselves behind the Suball, to invite interminable
arguments in re diplomatic history. Historians are still arguing about whether
England, Austria or Russia was most responsible for WWI. It is folly to maste
space attacking Stalin because he fought the Finns in order to get better defenses
for Leningrad, as we might fight anyone who threatened the Panama Canal. Or even
to try too hard to pin WW II on him. (It is still at least arguable that it wd
have taken place, in some fora, even if Russia had still been Tsarist. After all,
there has been mich carnage long before Stalin was even born.)

We should, to be sure, touch the iar and Peace there, which means so much
the world over. But the way to do it is to establish beyond doubt that the
man is and always has been bad, ditto the regime, they both tolerate no
opposition: therefore they are, in "self-defense" entransionist. But let us do
this with broad, repetitive strokes, not got bogged down in the details of
Munich, the Finnish War, Pearl Harbor.

We agroad that the best we can do, in all the circs, is to try onca
more to sell this view to Shub, and content cursolves with whatever result wo
can get.

In view of past failures to sell Boris on the subject (at least on many
points), I'm not too optimistic. I think wo should:

(1) Devil's advicato him on the pictures we think should be scrapped;

(2) Get a promise from him that he will give some space to certain topics
such as the SLAVE LADOR MAP and a display of, say, a dozen of the "Il Years
in Soviet Camps" type of authors; a display of the "Goo That Failed" men

I stressed that JBIII and self would be only too deligated if boris cạn
convince us it is better than we fear.

RE $90,000, I asked what about this figure, which I had heard mentioned
yesterday. Lyle said that Swen's investoent in it would be amounting to about
that. I asked if FE or SP would have to produce that sum. He said NO, Swen's
budget is sufficient to cover it, as is.

RE ROYALTIES FOR SHUB. He said the collaborator would be getting 75,
which he thought might bring him in $60,000. Hệ thought it might be justifiable
-"discuss it with Legal and Joe" that Soris's contract should be amended so
that he would get a portion of the royalties that nominally come to him, insofar

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

as they exceod his anmial salary. I asked what portion?" and Lyle said
"oh, perhaps or 1/3," which, if the excess wero $12,000 - figaro ile
suggested as possible- would bring him in an extra $4 or $6,000.
Shub's contract with CIA expires 31 Dec. 1951. His contract with 3wen,
Lyle pointed out, would stili bs in effect after that. 1 But his contract with
Xxn CIA would still no doubt obligato him to return royalties to CIA, 1.0.
Swon, even after 31 Dec. 1951.
I said this mightn't be a bad idea, as Shib may tend to go somewhat
sour, seeing his collaborator getting his much larger sslary and 7½ royalties
on top of that. On second thoughts, however, it is doubtless a very poor
precedent and we could perhaps obtain and quote to Shub CĨA Legal's opinion
to that effect that OPC employees should take royalties fron commercial
enterprises with which they happen to be connected.

I believe he is paid quite a generous figure, which ought to keep
a married man with no dependents ahead of the Collector of Internal Revenue.
If not, or if it is thought he is really worth more, the possibility of
suggesting to him a salary raise, when his contract as Agent comes up för
renewal, could be considered. At any rate, in the interests of keeping his
morale up during the final phases of work on the book, I suggest the whole
matter should be handled not too brusquely.

RE "COMMUNIST 200", and refusal of many US retailers to handle it, see
attached Memo of Record of what Munson told m
Munsoni We have to face plain facts. My experience with "C2" shows
that we have to mix in glasses of orange juice with the castor oil. "C2"is
about as vicious as the traffic will bear. If the "Stalin" photo book smacks
too strongly of propaganda, a lot of retailers just won't even handle it."

CONCLUSION. We should stay in NY long onuf to

(a) Hear everything Shub can say in defense of his version;

(b) Do a strong debil's advocate job against the pages we think
he should delete

(c) Insist that, in the remaining 66 pages, certain topics must be
adequately dealt with: Slave Labor, Defections, Cultural Purges,
Purges of top Communists in Iron Curtain countries。

(d) Hope for the best and be prepared to accept what may be a not too
satisfactory bargain, especially in view of what Iyle says about
retailers, and about mintaining Swen's reputation.

Lyle showed us 114 finished layouts / i.e. 57 two-page spreads of an eventual 172 or 174 and told us that the remainder would be finished in about 3 weeks. He also said that 60 pages of the text were now finished, and the rest would be done in about 6 weeks. He has asked us to provide him with the following material:

MUNSON saw Sims, Smith, Loobs at his hotel 16 April 1951

Munson went through the complete book last Wednesday and Thursday evenings, April 11 and 12. He is sure it will be one of the really important books of 1951.

He has asked for 3 photostat proofs of the layout, which we can look at down here. He agrees with me that no useful purpose would be served by my going to NY to see it, as I Shub had sugested, He thinks it inadvisable that "a stream of people" should go to Shub's collaborator's apartment.

They are now aiming at a book of 175 to 195 pages, the pages to be of Vogue size; which, on an average of 7 to 8 photos per double-page, will come to some 600 or more photos.
It is more than the personal career of Stalin; it could better be called something like "The Rise and Rule of Stalinian."

He is pressing for a SEPTEMBER 10th PRESS DATE. That may be too optimistic, but he has located a Chicago press which prints either Vogue (Conde Nast) or a Vogue-size magazine, and which, if they stick to that format, can handle it with dispatch. Munson will be going to Chicago to investigate.

PRICE. "I could be 100% wrong on this estimate," but: it should cost a minimum of $1.25 to print, and, if we want to make 25¢ net, $2.95 or $3.00 would be the minimum at which Brentano could retail it. / I'll bet it will come to more than this.

Shub's collaborator, "absolutely wonderful; the book is now 75% his", will get 7½% royalties, Shub's nominal royalties will revert to Swen.

Munson feels strongly that it is very bad policy to sell a book at less than obvious cost. He says he is completely certain that this is true in the Orient, and gave is a chapter-and-verse example (which escapes me) to illustrate it.
By *obvious cost* he means that it may be OK to count on the public's not guessing how much it may have cost you to pay a Barnes and to do, e.g., seven prints of some of the C.Z. photos; but it is bad to price a book at less than what the physical comments ist obviusly have cost.
He is dead sure this applies to the Orient, and strongly suspects that it would hold good for Western Europe also.

SIMS saw MAISON in his hotel 19 March 1951

In addition to the details which be gave about Communist Zoo and the "Stalin" photo-book, Munson said:

Re Swen, "Tell Jõe I need a man who knows the book publishing business, as a "ecnsultant or part time helper. To be paid something like $300 to $400 a month, for which he would gige, say, a week of his time each month."
I asked if he would like to have any CIA man detailed to do liaison with and be part-time helper of Spen; Hinson said he didn't think a staff man would be very secure. He'd need to travel, deal with other publishers, ete.

Swen offices are established in Taipei, Tokyo, Manila, Hong Kong, Bangkok,

Swen will reproduce material in any language, in any format. If anybody wants him to do a job, let them contact him.
I asked how about getting material translated; he said you can always got it done in New York.
The finished product would be cargoed out to the field.

Re ROCKPORT, the artist. Munson has been paying tim ($350 a meath I think), and now feels he has gotten about as much material out of him as he will need.
Why not suggest to SCHILLER that The Challenge employ him on a regular basis?"
I said that the editors of The Challenge (all Russian-speaking) mist already know him, since they have used his drawings. That when he finds himself unemployed he can, and quite likely will, approach than anyway. Thy not let them decide whether they want to employ him, rather than for us to complicate matters, through SCHILLER, by forcing this extremely "difficult" men on then? Munson agreed we should let it ride.

If the editors themselves want to employ him, we can then decide whether and how much of the DIEXCISE funds should be used to pay him. As he is very difficult and dilatory it might be better to stipulats that he be paid on a piece-work basis.

He "Great Swindle" and Swen's distribution problem in general.

Munson said that, while the photo-books should pay their own way, it was never contemplated that The Great Swindle would be a commercial success. Distribution of such material is Swen's great problem.

SCHILLER wrote Munson that he (FTUC) couldn't use The Great Swindle. Munson thinks professional jealousy entered into this. SCHILLER made some criticism to the effect that the booklet bears no Trade Union logotype, whereas he should know perfectly well that lithographed material never does.

SCHILLER should simply be told: Put out so many copies of the Great Swindle."
Alternatively, the geoegraphic Divisons should give indigenous Anti-Comunist groups $25,000 or $2,500 and say: "This is yours if you nail out wapteen thousand copies of the booklet with it.

Re State Dept. and Great Swindle. Munson suggested my giving a copy of the Great Swindle to Mrs. Crossmell or Col. Stubbs and asking them to recommend it to Mecknight as something they had come across, dth the suggestion that the State Department buy copies of it for all their Reading Rooms.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 43

I asked whether Macknight or anyone in State knew of CIA's connection with Sven. He said he did not know, though he dared say MacKnight might. He said he would be willing to call on Macknight to discuss State Dept. assistance in getting Swen stuff disseminated, representing himself merely as a private citizen.

I said I hadn't and wouldn't make any mention of Swen to anyone at State.

Horace Eng is as much as anyone Munson's main CIA contact, but, he said, Horace of course doesn't have time to concern himself actively with dissemination outside the FE area.

I told him about recent State publications, in their "gray" program, such as *Glossary of Soviet Terms*, and pointed out that State and Swen are now putting out similar material.

I said I hoped some sort of set-up might be arranged whereby State would help disseminate some of Swen's publications.

Suggest that the initiative towards any such set-up has to come primarily from Munson himself, but that it will be potentially an important matter requiring careful working out by CPW, Col. Stubbs, Munson and State Dept.

Dear Boris,

Thanks for y ours of the 22nd, reached me Saturday evening, arossing mine of the 23rd to you.

It is all wonsterful now, and the more you think about it the moro aming it is that nothing oven remotely resembling it has ever been done anywhere in the world". And I know what a hell of a lot of work and worry it is, and what relief it will be then it is safely done.

Imin als go to you this morning by registered mall. Those are my all at the mount. You will find then a great deal better than none. In fact, you may think they are enough to do the trick, Reflect that no on
-fabery in photos having a long history since I can in itself const tute conclusive proof, nor any photo that could be.

For that, your teat will carry more weight: the undisputed facts of geography and chronology, the depositiones the TACIT ADMISSION OF GUILT IN THE DARING PALLURE OF THE USSR TO RAISE THE HATTER AT LURENBERG (here sos Churchill's last volume, and perhaps quote a sentence or two from hing "Panes malos nova"; see also Mikolajonyk, from whom you may call a juicy quote or two.)

It seems that about a dozen photos were given to all who attended the 21 Nov. 1949 press conference. So you may find Ep and/or the HL has one or two more. Dat there is not much more, Just one or two others of Layers of corpses.

Your impact will come from the skilfull addition of citation of facts to the pix I'm sonding, don't you think?

On your second request I'll do what I can. But you know one of the main reasons why it may not be much, ky friend who will know returns fron out of town tomorrow.

"Baltic Review" has no pix. "Estonian Magazine has only sconde. However I may be able to do something tomorrow.

Here again I suggest you consider capitalising on the very absence of pictares, remembering that you have a great gift for the trenchant phrase. B.g., life in Riga pre-1939 was not too bad, nou, as you can quote from the press, there is deportation after deportation partisans, exploitation, almost universal hatred of the "people's democratic regio. Edmund Stovens in

This is R. Uncensored you'll recall said nothing so gave him the impression of the Living de thunder-Stalin an Riga, which he revisited. Therefore, Just show a RIGA PEOPLE IN MARKET SQUARI SCARS, PLUS QUOTE FROI STEVENS, and a bit of biting Shabian prose contrasting 1939 and 1949. Don't you tak there is a place for a fon "peaceful" pictures of this sort? Fix of partisans in action are few and far between, and often fussy, and there can anyway be, as you were saying, such a thing as too many atrocity pictures.

Pari passu, why not use some ordinary, paaceful UKRADILAN scones, plus RECENT UCTES PRCU PRAVDA, repeat PRAVDA, OFFICIALLY ADIITTIDIG CRIVE PESIS-TANCE THERE. I can't give you said quotes, but you or some of your friends very likely can lay hands on them,

After all, no "resistance" photo, what with fakery, will enrry conviction to those who won't be convinced. But a PHOTO OF THE FAGE OF PRAVDA, with the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 49

sentences underlined, must shaks even the faithful.

On Lubianka I can't help. If the NY Tines won't help, and there is nothing in any agency files can this be?- I guess you've had 1t. Here again you might capitalize on the absence: can they be ashamed of this historic edifice, which plays so vital a role in the national life? E.g., Herblock today has a "cartoon" which has merely a black border around a white space, with the mast- head of La Prensa above. Needless to say, it is eye-catching in the extreme. Why not do the same with Lubianka?

Alternatively, you might have a photo of 60 Andrassy Ut, and perhaps combine arm with the abora empty space treatment,

I grant you that if this technique were carried to the extrare, you would be making history with a photo-loss photo-book; but rest assured the Herblock cartoon is a 100% attention-catcher,

Couldn't agree more with your last paragraphs, However, there has been marked progresa.

I expect, d.v., at long last to be absent from Friday the 30th till Monday the 16th, and mail probably won't be forsarded. Therefore please write Jif need arises.

Dear Bill:

Picture book now in high gear as layout is beginning to take shape. New pictures of both historical and photographic pricelessness still coming in I.e.g. a shot showing a wildly cheering crowd of Russian peasants greeting first German troops---before latter went in for mass murder) This picture never used in this country. Could multiply by many examples but prefer to have you come down and see for yourself. If you could be here about three weeks from now, you could get a fairly good notion of what the finished product will look like (although there will still by a lot of polishing, caption writing and final checking to do). I am now certain that the book will be a major political event. wothing even remotely resembling it has ever been done--anywhere in the world.

Need help on two xidad sectors promptly:

1.  Katyn massacre pictures, Saw lots of them your neck of the woods. Please send them soonest, properly packed in cardboard to prevent folding or cracking. This is a must, since for some ond reason this is missing from the otherwise bottomless archives which we've unearthed..

2.  Any decent shots of anti-Communist resistance behind the

Iron Curtain. We have a few of the past German things with the "F" painted on walls. But Joe mentioned others. Cant have too much of tais, since it constitutes an essential element in the closing part of the story.

Hope this presents no obstacles. Joe thought is your end could send stuff to me. Rенсохгневолжкрус regenstx Registered mail sufficient precaution, it seems to me

The Acheson lester in today's NY Times re friendship with the Russian people a step in the wight direction though still a long way even from the speech delivered at Town Hall by McMahon day before yesterday. But somehow, someone must teach Acheson to cut out this sort of humbuging:

"If the men of the Kremlin could but conquer their inward fears and resolve their contradictions, if they could but bring themselves to the comity which is the foundation of peace, great burdens would be lifted from the shoulders of people everywhere."

That is the purpose of this rubbish? I know lots of professional diplomats think this is very "cute" and arch stuff, really meant to "embarrass" people like J.Stalin and G. Malenkov. Actually, the only thing it can arouse, bothnamong the Kremlin war criminals and among their victims is --utter contempt. If anybody in Moscow takes that drivel at face value, they conclude that the U.S. is still too frightpe ened of the boogey man in the Kremlin to call a spade a spade. That silly stuff must end! Please end it. The inward fears of Stalin-lal-enkov-Beria will only be resolved on the gallows. Best regards..

Dear Boris,

Thanks for the clippings. All to the good.

Fill do what I can to help, but, for reasons that will re-occur to you, you shouldn't bank on its being a great deal.

Suggest you right well get excellent results by following the trail, via phone and tel, of the AMERICAN COMMITTEE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KATYN MASSACRE, DC., which was, at the time of its founding circa Nov. 1949, Room 1209, 470 Fourth Avenue, NY 16, LO-6-4408.
Chairman, Arthur Bliss Lane, Vice-chairman: Max Eastman, Dorothy Thompson, Treasurer: Montgomery W. Green, Executive Secretary: Julius Epstein.
Why not contact Lane, or Epstein? Why shouldn't they be glad to help with their material, both textual and photographic.

Others listed as Committee Members: Constantine Brown, G. Creel, H. de Donovan, A. W. Dulles, Farley, B. F. Gunther, Sol H. Levitas,.. B. Lyons, Charles Rozmarek, Sokolsky, V. S. Freedon, Jas. A. Walsh,

*New Leader*, 30 Sept. 1950, had an article *New Light on Katyn Massacre*.
"The Defense Dept.'s release of a top secret report on the mystery-shrouded Katyn massacre has shed new light..... The release of the Van Vliet report, written by an American Lt.-Col. held captive in Germany who reluctantly fixed the guilt on Moscow after a Nazi-sponsored visit to Katyn is the first major break in the conspiracy of silence which has surrounded the affair ever since."

"In 1943..the NL carried an exclusive article by Kerensky..directly charging the Kremlin...Last year the NL published a special A-page supplement on Katyn by Julius EPSTEIN. (See your local phone-book)....
"It was only as a result of the Committee's persistent efforts that the long-suppressed Van Vliet report was finally released..."

If you haven't you should glance at Mikolajczyk's account in *The Rape of Poland*. Because it contains a verbatim alleged account of how "it came about" by a shame-faced Russian officer in London, which you might find quotable. "So they asked 'Father' (Stalin) and 'Father' said..etc..."
Churchill in his latest volume, in an oddly restrained account, makes it clear he knows Stalin was responsible, and refers to the books by M. and Anders.

Photos. *The NY Times*, serializing Churchill, 9 Nov. 1950, had, if you are interested in irony or impudence or whatever, a rather blurred photo, released at the time by SOVFOTO, which Sovfoto described as showing members of the Polish Corps of the USSR holding memorial services at "the common grave of the Polish officers and men brutally shot by the Germans."

Some of the corpses show marks made by the four-sided, peculiarly Russian bayonet, and others had hands tied with the MVD-type knot. Surely Epstein can help you here?

Please let me know how you make out with Epstein and/or others, and don't hesitate to ask me again. I just think he's a better, quicker bet. I'll do what I can re the other pix and let you know. It sounds a masterpiece.

Sincerely,

Bill.

CP log. New York, 17 March 1952

1. I spent three hours with Boris Shub today, two of them in looking over his collection of photographs with his associate, Mr. Quint, of *Life*. Boris and Quint hope to have their book ready for publication by the end of May, when they will have reduced their collection to 500 photographs, which they estimate will fill about 200 pages. I have no doubt that the book will be a commercial success; my only wonder is why it has not been done before. Boris asks our help in obtaining certain photographs. (Bill Sims please note.) He wants all procurable photos of the Katyn Massacre, all resistance photos (Bill: Is there a magazine called the Estonian Review, which prints a good many of those?) and a certain photo of Lubianka prison, in Moscow. *The New York Times* had a photograph of Lubianka in its issue of Saturday, 12 November 1949, to illustrate installment 7 of General Smith's Memoirs, and IRB should be able to discover where the original came from. Boris has a letter from the Vanguard Press expressing hope that his biography of Stalin would be ready by 1 May; he will notify Vanguard that it cannot possibly be ready for another seven months. Finally, he told me that he was meeting Colonel Kintner on 20 March, for several conferences on BRAVE. He signed his secrecy agreement, which I will deliver to John Shields on my return.

As lunch today Munson said that HEADLEY has finished his part of the work on the photo-book on the career of Stalin; he has completed the text part; his collaborator is *1000%* better qualified to select the photos and do the lay-out.

In security the collaborator's employers told Munson *"brutally"* firmly that while the collaborator's name can appear on the book (along with HEADLEY's) and it will be revealed that that magazine was the source of the pictures, and they may help *"syndicate"* it, if it is blown that they are selling the pictures available *free*, the deal is off.

Munson thinks the book will be a world-beater, but that it may take till August to have it ready.

I said that we have $40,000 still untouched in FIFUNE, which was appropriated for *"similar photo-books at the discretion of CSP"*, and suggested helping Swan out with some of that. He said he wasn't worried about money; that he thought OFC was if anything too ready to spend the taxpayer's money; that Swan's products should be able to pull their own weight. The book might have to sell for $3.50 or more in the US; in Hong Kong it would be $1 or $2.

He will pay both HEADLEY and the collaborator royalties. HELIOTYPE will be returned to Swan.

RNACLAT wrote re recently that the book was now at a stage where most of the work had to be done by his collaborator. Since his name is to appear on it, I imagine he will still have to put in quite a bit of time on it, from time to time. Reason: He is also -or was when I last heard- doing *part-time* work on loan to WB in connection with BRAINWAVE.

**Conclusion:** except for the above, he is not occupied, and Hanson suggests we should give his another job to do.

Dear Bill:

Good to hear from you, even though your letter, as usual, too briefer for my apetite. From "our mutual friend Willia" you know more about my activities than I do about yours.

[a top Life lay-out man]

My collaborator is working like a fiend, with the asistence of a sub-fiend (female) who digs up pictures by the hundreds (literally). Last night I worked with him until 2 ocroc in the morning (with a brief intermission for a prize fight on his television set). In that long stretch we went trough over 400 pictures which he had just combed out of various labyrinths. Out of this batch we discarded about one-third, tossed away a couple of dozen poor substitutes for the real thing which the new haul corrected, and filled the present 40-odd chapter folders (provisional) with the cream of the crop.

As you will gather from the above paragraph, the illustrated book on the man and his international network --and the forces all over the world arrayed on his side and against him--- ain't no ordinary picture album. It will be, I am quite certain, a major work. There is little point attempting to describe it in a letter, but I am quite comfident that it will be read xoxoce--and even ore important- lookei at, with absorbed interest this year, next and ten years from now. That is more important, it will make envincing, I am certain, what no words, written or spoken, can ever make completely co: vircing.

As far as the "date when it will be wrapped up"---

I can only say that I am acting the role of the slave-driver and the speedup man right now. It is, however, a ticklish role, wichou lave undesirable results if overdone.

Both my main collaborator, who is certainly one of the best men in the country in the field--and the best man for this particular book, is giving it every free moment, as Is his fantastic research assistant. But a good picture book--as I told you хеховхроноx when we discussed the idea orijinally, is as much of a job as an pod book. I think we have broken the back of the job, and I côn content that the roduct will excel your fondest dreams. as far inpointen the date, I think I'll be in a better position to do that in about tree weeks, when the haul will be substantially in, and when we will have pared down our present mourtainous collection to the essence.

I should Leagine that when our friend [Swen] returns from his present jum, collaborator and I will be able to Live him a falr or testions in connection with the actual printing job. The largest single question we see is this:

Price of bo versus quality and lasting value.

That I wear at we look as now shapes up


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 59

- 2 -

is a major work--a complete pictorial history not only of the man, but of the setting that produced him, the international ramifications that are so much a part of his life, his intrigues and his inclinations. But that is even more intriguing, we are reaching the stage where the pictures illustrating all this will be of first-rate pictorial quality. How we do all this and still save fast.

we are agreed that it could be a serious mistake to sacrifice either quality or essential elements of the over-all story. The trick now is to do all that and yet turn out a book that, by one means or another, will sell at a price likely to make it a mass-circulation job.

For further details, please board first available train or plane and join me over a drink at 510 West 110 Street. Perhaps I've already put too much of this on a typewriter. I wish you could have seen the pictures we worked on last nite. You would then realize that the original stuff you saw was so much fourth-rate stuff by comparison.

(I guess the last two sentences are really intended as a lure. But I really would like to see you soon)
Best regards to the gang. Will give you a more exact timetable as soon as it is feasible.

STATUS OF W.S.S. PROJECTS

"STALIN" PHOTO-BOOK PROJECT.

This has not yet been formally written up as a project, because it has been being implemented, *de facto*, by our salaried contract agent HEADLEY in conjunction with the publisher Swen Publishing Co., who has been meeting the bill and will continue to do so.

Nevertheless I think it will shortly prove desirable for me to write it up, since (a) it may prove desirable for SP (under FUNNY) to subsidize Swen on it, in order to make possible a somewhat lower selling price, and (b) it will be more convenient to have it wrapped up as a named project, which can be referred to by name, and for which SP can have credit in its status reports.

HEADLEY has completed the text part of the book. He and a top-flight Life lay-out man, of whom he has a very high opinion (and an assistant who helps the Life man dig up photos) have been through a very large number of photos. HEADLEY is confident that the book will be a first-class job.

If all continues to go well on the Life front, i.e. if they make no objection to the use of pictures from their files the main remaining problem will be: how to combine retention of high quality, i.e. adequate reproduction of as many photos as they need to tell the story the way they feel it should be told, with quantity, i.e. sale at a low enough price to make possible wide dissemination.

Too heavy a subsidy (by OPC) would blow the Government-inspiration of the book. Perhaps, if the book proves to be as good as we feel it should, the State Department's ILI Information Program or Book Translation Program might get behind it in a big way?

We should go energetically into this problem of selling it at a low enough price as soon as Swen's president returns. In the meantime HEADLEY and I are of opinion that quality should not be sacrificed. If it is of really first-class quality and Pil effectiveness, quantity can be achieved, somehow, by subsidy.

HEADLEY will appear overtly as the author. Possibly the A. F. of L. might help give it world-wide distribution, as they have done in the case of the maps of the Slave Labor Camps in the USSR.

If all continues to go well, it looks as though the book might be getting into shape for the printer in April or May.

When this is written up as a Project, it will be a Sub-project under EMFUNNY, KUFUNIFY, approved long ago, includes a Recommendation (para 5) "...that...the sum of $40,000 be appropriated for the development and distribution of simioler photo-books at the discretion of Chief, SP."

The Sub-project requires only the signature of Chief, SP, as I understand.

EXPENSES. Small sums were paid to HEADELEY, summer 1950, duly recorded in Ray Willard's office, for payment in connection with photos obtained from New

Dear Boris,

Delighted!

And I have circulated the good news around.

Yes, when our pal returns - which I gather should be somewhere round about March 15 - we will have to address ourselves in a big way to the problem of achieving both quality and quantity. As time goes on, I imagine he will get better and better able to cope with that problem, and I think he should be helped in a big way to do so. In the meantime, I agree with what I'm sure is your view (your letter is not at hand at the moment) that any conflicts between q. and q. should be resolved in favor of quality. The quantity can follow. (Build the really quality mouse-trap, and sooner or later, preferably sooner, the world will beat the path).

Just a detail: you've undoubtedly seen the De Custine in the March 5 LIFE. Could you use:

> "To live in the Kremlin is not to live; it is to protect oneself; oppression creates revolt; revolt necessitates precautions; precautions increase the danger; and of this long series of actions and reactions is born a monster, despotism which has built itself a house in Moscow - the Kremlin!" (p. 124) ?

I still agree with you the thing as a whole is marred slightly by the phrase "...this essentially aggressive nation..."

I haven't any immediate plans to go to N. Y., but we must certainly foregather before long.

Best regards,

Bill

Glad to hear from Deo-dee that you are still alive and kicking. And, especially, that there is some prospect of your getting down this way. I sure hope you do.

Also glad to hear from our mutual friend William that he's seen you, and to get some news of you from him; and that you still have got some news in general from him.

How is your collaborator coming, and is he squared away with his bosses? What is your best current guess as to the date when it will be wrapped up?

Jee got generally overworked and came down with grippe, and left for two or three weeks or more to recuperate. A lot of people round here have been or are laid up; I was for a couple of days and am still somewhat under the weather. However, even if I haven't written I've thought of you often.

At request of r. winston I phoned Shub (A02-0164) to ask about progress on the Photo-book, and what is the earliest date at which he may be thru with it. No answer.

RAW says Kintner is asking for him for BRAINWAVE. I suggested not interrupting him till he has finished the photo book, RAW consulted LST, who said to say Shub might be made available on a part-time basis.
RAW understands he would do his work for BRAINWAVE in NY. I said this seemed OK, if it were to be only part-time.

Re: STALIN PHOTO-BOOK, tie-in with Life.

Re DAILY DIAPY of Jan. 27: "Piornio of Feal webbi informed me that he understood thit Time and Life absolutely did not want any of their people connected with any intelligence organisation and that Allen Dulles had given instructions that none of then were to be approached without Mr. Elmer's written approval. On the assignment in question, Piornio gave up any attempt to utilise the san they have on Life's staff and hes sent another men to cover the assignment instead."

Shab, who is preparing a photo-book on Stalin's carcer for Swan, is getting (or hopes he is getting) the help of "one of Life's top lay-out men" (only Shab knows his name; Humson didn't want to ask him), at $35 per diem. _who it is_

Shab, of course, is doing the book ostensibly as a private citizen, so if security is maintained it doesn't seem to involve a Life man being "connected with any intelligence organisation."

As they get ready to publish (perhaps April), the Life man will have to decide whether he wants His name to appear on the book as collaborator, in which case he will probably have to (a) got Life's permission. And (b) if they use any photos from Life's files, as well as from agencies, he will have to got permission for that too.

It should all be OK if Shab keeps up his cover as private citizen.

Mr. Richards (Legal) phoned, on behalf of Mr. Kelley, re the contract between HEDLEY & CIA re disposition of royalties.

He said Mr. Kelley had referred it to his, with some such message as: "to let it stand as it is, if appropriate documention of the records there / Swen?/ and here can be provided".

Mr. Richards asked if doing the photo-book was to be HEDLEY’s main activity. I said yes, for a month or two, after which he would have some new assignment. He said all the better.

I said the only problem had seemed to be whether there was any legal objection to having Swen held the rights to the book instead of "the Government" and Swen receive back the royalties instead of "CIA".

Mr. Richards seemed to agree there was no substantial difficulty there, and ended: "Ok, Joe or I will let you know if there seems to be any difficulty there or need to amend the contract", or words to such that effect.

15 Jan. '51

MR. THOMPSON

SUBJECT: Shub's work for SP.

1. He is a covert "contract agent", contract expiring 1st Dec. 1951.

2. As far as I know, he is working only on the "STALIN" PHOTO-BOOK, a book of probably some 150 photos-on-text on the career of Stalin exposing, mostly out of his own mouth, his duplicity and ruthlessness to his own colleagues, etc., etc. This is to be published by Sven Publishing Co. There will be master negatives, and it should be good for publication in every country.

3. "The Choice" was published October 29, and after giving him a week to recover from the excitements of first-time authorship (he had a good many radio and TV interviews),

4. JEIII needled him November 9:

> "We are very anxious to have the photo-book finished as fast as possible. Handled as you alone can do it, this book will be one of the most effective shots that can be fired and we need it quick."

> "My understanding is that you are now engaged full time on it. Is that also your understanding? If so, please let me know (1) that the photo-book is your first concern, and (2) what progress you have made to date."

> "Again let me emphasize the great enthusiasm we have for the photo-book, and our complete confidence that it will have your own brilliant, informed and incisive touch when completed."

5. Shub replied November 14:

> "I am anxious to get the picture book rolling and done as quickly as possible. The loose ends connected with the THE CHOICE (radio appearances, sticking pins and needles into Donothi, Sloth and Pierce, etc.) while nerve-racking, do not take as much of my time any longer, so that I am in a position to devote my full time to the picture book."

> "I'm partially stymied, however, by your cryptic series of notes and instructions regarding a publisher. Thought the thing was pretty well settled when your note was given to me at the lunch at..."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

Biltmore recently / with lst/. But your letter of November 8, 1950 had this footnotes:

"Please be sure not to say anything at all to anyone about the mutual friend who was contined at lunch / Munson; very important; he'll explain why when and if he sees you, perhaps within a week or two./ This was just that Munson was anxious about security for Suen."

"Without a final decision on type of publisher it is exceedingly difficult to determine character, size, tone and scope of the book. It would help a great deal to know what's up on that score. Simon & Schuster presents one type of problem and suggests one kind of approach. The mutual friend, who I assume (without being 100% sure) is the publisher you referred to in the note you sent to the Biltmore - and suggests something quite different - perhaps much simpler and direct - and more outspoken."

"If this question cannot be clarified by mail, please arrange for us to get together soonest. Once this is out of way, I hope to move fast. I'd be a four-flusher and liar if I pretended that I had made notable progress until now. I've been held up not only by the above, but - being painfully human - by a lingering desire to keep THE CHOICE from being embalmed in the Douthling, Sloth & Pierse Funeral Parlors. I've now given it about all I've got and will do my darnedest is not to allow it to cause me any further loss of sleep or diversion of energy from the job on hand."

6. Munson had a long phone conversation with Shub November 17, at Simm's request, and planned to see him November 21.

Forgetting 20 Munson told Sims that Suen will publish the book.

7. A Contract between Shub and CIA was drawn up by Joe Kelley and Sims, and signed Sept. 16, 1950, whereby the "Government" will own all rights to the book, and Shub will return his royalties "to CIA".

How that Suen is to be the publisher, I have asked Joe Kelley whether it will be OK that the rights should be owned by Suen (a CIA-controlled corporation) and the royalties returned to Suen; or whether he wants to amend the contract.

8. Progress on the book. Last summer Shub and I got some 150 photos from CIA Graphics, of which I sent him sterilized duplicates to New York. He also got 75 excellent ones from New York photo agencies. I have from time to time sent him a lot of suggestions for photos and captions, and if he wants anything done down here he will let me know.

Shub wrote me, December 14:

"This is just a brief note to give you the latest on the picture front. I won't fill you in on the details because our mutual friend / Munson / will be in Washington early next week and will give you all the dope. Dottertdottertdot."

"Suffice it to say that my collaborator / whom Suen has authorized him to pay $35 per diem / is one of the top layout men on

life, one of those $25,000 per annum non. For the present he doesn't want his association with the picture book known to his employer for several good and compelling raisons. (Including the fear that they would plagiarize the idea). But in the final stages he'll have to tell them in order to get their cooperation on digging into their files as well as their official permission for the use of his name as a collaborator.

Bloodless to say, all of the above is a deep dark secret, but then what isn't these days? More important than all of the above is the fact that the gentleman in question / Lunson purposely didn't ask Shub who his collaborator is, in addition to being a top flight picture man, is deeply interested in the subject and miraculously knows a great deal about it.

"I have nothing happens to make him back down on his decision. Impossible to get anybody nearly as qualified. Our friend will fill you in on the rest: what remains to be done, how to do it, etc."

"Of one thing you may be sure: If my collaborator stays with the project and if no act of God intervenes, the final product will be the picture book of all time. He wants to see it sold on newsstands among other places.."

9. Lunson told me January 8 he had soon Shub about a week before, and "he should be rolling pretty soon."

10. FLASH! Shub just phoned, he said I had proved correct on the point that "having the book all pictures, without words, is rubbish." He has found it necessary to do a brief written Life of Stalin, bringing in all his major misdeeds, and keeping it as simple & clear-cut as possible. The US of that is now being typed. That was the hardest part of the job. Now it should go fast, if the mechanics can be done fast. Namely, the Life collaborator will get the extra pictures from the files needed to fill in the story.

Shub thinks it is really pretty good.

I asked if the Life man's name will appear on it. We both agreed there is no reason why it shouldn't. It will depend on whether the Life man wants it, and whether he thinks it would go down with his bosses.

I told Shub Lunson was planning to be away 3 to 4 weeks from about Jan. 28, possibly earlier. Shub will contact Lunson before then. We agreed Shub should be able to carry on with Munson's printer in Munson's absence.

11. CONCLUSION. Depending on (a) how much time the Life man can give to it, and (b) how fast Lunson's printer can handle it / he is just starting in on the printing of *FUTUR* Animal photo-book / the book should, with luck, be ready about 6 or 8 weeks from now, say about March 15.

Shab to work on the photo book instead. JEIII said, "Leave Shab to rate the

of Hovember 15, above, didn't mention the biography.

If there is nothing more prossing for him to do, perhape Shab
might be asked to work again on the biography when he has wrapped up the

MR. KELLEY

RE: Agreement (16 Sept. 1950) between CIA and HEADLEY re production of photo-book.

You will recall that in the agreement, which you drew up and which was signed 16 Sept. 1950 by Mr. Cohols and ROBERT K. HEADLEY, it is provided that HEADLEY will be required to transfer the gross royalties to CIA.

Swan Publishing Co. is now to be the publisher of the book, I see Hanson Dec. 19, who told me he has already advanced money to ROBERT HEADLEY for expenses, and has authorized me to pay his collaborator (a life lay-out man) on a fixed fee basis, i.e. not more than $35 per diem.

Swan plans to pay all the expenses of production. It is his understanding that

(a) Swan will, on paper, pay HEADLEY standard royalties, which HEADLEY will return to Swan, and that

(b) Swan will own all rights in the book (which will facilitate Swan's putting out foreign editions).

In other words, it is Hunson's hope, and mine, that, as he put it, Swan, being a wholly CIA-controlled corporation, "will simply step into the shoes of the Government" and 'CIA' in the agreement."

Hunson said y ou had drawn up the papers for Swan. We both hoped this way of handling the matter, whereby the financial details would all be handled in Swan's books and not occupy the time of OPC personnel, will be legally acceptable?

When I mentioned the matter to John Bischoff, Jan. 5, he said he thought we should check with you whethers

(a) we can simply let the 16 Sept. 1950 agreement stand as is, or

(b) whether the agreement should be amended to read "to Swan" instead of "the Government" and "CIA".

Re: KMFUNNY.........and "STALIN" PHOTO-FOOK:

SI'S saw MUKSON in his hotel, Dec. 19, 1950

Munson leaves for NY this evening. OK to leave messages for him to phone.

Re HOKE-BOOK. He mentioned a contemplated pocket size book, collecting anti-CP jokes. I said I would contribute what we had in PB II and add fron time to time. For further details see my folder JOKES.
He gave me postcard (St) by Rockport illustrating joke about "Who Owns the Automobiles". (He got this from a 13-yr-old boy in Germany in 1947, and he and an Army man each put $20 of their own into having it xox printed and spread).

Re KMFUNY Barnes was to have met him Friday (Dec. 15), but had to go out of town to a funeral.

He expects to see Barnes tomorrow (Dec. 20), when Barnes is to deliver about 60 of the photos with his own captions. Munson will then let CHAPPELL look it over for a couple of days. He will then bring it down here and ask Messrs. Eryan. Nadler and Sims look at it. (I told him not to hesitate to leave me out).

Barnes has been OK. I said I would check how his clearance is coming. It was requested Nov. 2 and should be ready, says John Shields, about 3½ months from Nov. 2

Re "STALIN" PHOTO-FOUR, See Shub's letter to Sins, Dec. 14, in file. Munson also thinks it is coming well, and should be good, if the Life man continues to prove a good collaborator.

Munson does not know the name of Shub's Life collaborator: he did not encourage Shub to tell him. / Kunson says he is sure SHEN is still secure, and there is no reason why it shouldn't continue to be, "if everyone in CIA will keep their big mouths shit; too many know about it"). SWEN may be suspected of Government-inspiration, but it should not be blown.

Munson has advanced Shub money to pay expenses, and has authorized bin to pay his collaborator not more than $35 a day. The collaborator wil definitely be paid on a fixed fee basis, i.e. per diem, no royalties. SWEN can pick up the tab for Shub's expenses in procuring photos, etc That will appear in Swen's accounts, but, happily, there is no need for KMFUNNY's files to be cluttered up with the details.

LUNSON knows of the agreement, re disposition of royalties, which SHUB (HEADLEY) signed with CIA. He has seen it; i.e., presumably has seen the sterilized notes Shub made of it, since Shib retained no copy.
LUNSON understands that SHEN will own all rights to the book. I.e., "SWEN will simply step into the place of CIA in the above agreement. I.e., Still, on paper, will be paying Shub standard royalties, but Shub will return them to SHEN.

I said that, as far as I could see, this sounded OK, SAEN being 100% a CIA corporation, Lunson said that Joe Kelley had helped draw up the papers setting up SWEN, and was therefore fully cognizant of it and sympathetic to it. Orly an excessively legal-minded bureaucrat would quibble over, having the royalties re-absorbed by SWEN, rather than disposed of acconting

to para. 4 of the above-mentioned agreement (16 Sept. 1950), according to which "You will be required to transfer the gross royalties to CIA..." (This agreement was also drafted by Mr. Kelley). There doesn't seem to be any difficulties of substance there.

There has been no decision on the size, format, etc. of the book. I mentioned that I had written Shub, mentioning that Simon & Schuster is able to offer its $3.95 *FOR a Pictorial History* - "260 photos with commentary" - at only $1.50 in cloth.

I said Shub had written some time ago that it would be a help to know the approximate number of photos as soon as possible, and Lyle said he of course agreed. He thought Shub and his collaborator should have something to show in, say, 30 days.

I mentioned that the "STALIN" PHOTO-BOOK, when written up, which I will do shortly, will merely be a sub Project of KUFUINY, and will therefore require only Mr. Thompson's signature. Lyle queried whether it was necessary to make a formal project of it at all. I said that, for purposes of Status Reports, etc., it would be more or less necessary to have a formal title for it, and he agreed.

Shub has about 150 sterilized CIA Graphics photos, which we selected last summer. None of them could actually be printed, published, without a release from CIA Graphics. I therefore urged Munson to urge Shub to work up a good cover story about them, vis-a-vis his collaborator. Munson said he would advise him not to use them at all. (They are run-of-the-mine; they could all be duplicated with ease from agencies).

I told Munson that Mrs. Poland, of CIA Graphics (of whom he knows) had personally made an arrangement with Roy Larsen, whereby he supplies them with photos from *Time-Life* files, but not for publication. And that she had told me she is particularly anxious to do nothing that would undermine her relations with Time-Life.

We agreed that, if Shub's collaborator gets permission to use photos from Life's files in the book, it will still be a book being prepared for the overt SWEN Company, and that Life will not know the Government is involved. Munson thinks Shub is being very circumspect about all this.

Dear Boris,

Many thanks for your excellent letter of the 13th, which I got this evening, and all the good news about "The Choice", which I'll share.

I'll try to clarify about our mutual friend / lunson / just as soon as I possibly can. Couldn't reach him all this evening. Maybe I can get him tomorrow morning. all urge him to see you at the earliest and get it all clarified, as that will as you say be a great help. Meanwhile why not go ahead on an estimate of say 150 pp. Hope he can see you by Tuesday or at earliest thereafter..

Best regards
hastily

P.S.

Good about "Lenin2 too.

And the Navy!

And the dual German edition!

I queried Ray about how to send your letter to Shub, and he sterilized it and said it could go as sterilized, I will mail it this evening. Ray changed no matters of substance. (But the sentence about "we are pressed for full weekly reports" had to go out; the sterilized version of it wouldn't do the trick).

Re communicating with Shub. Ray says there is no OPC man in NY/00. There may be one *later* letter. That NY/00 are not supposed to know SP details, and that, failing the OPC man there, the only means of regular communication with Shub are:

1.  fully sterilized letters thru ordinary mail (letters via 00 would equally have to be sterilized)
2.  hand-carried letters

Dear Boris,

Re your book. I went fully into the question of ordering copies, and it is clear that it is not policy anywhere to do anything official to promote the distribution of it. There is just nothing in the charter that would authorize officially promoting a book of that very wide scope, except for limited internal circulation.

That leaves it, as I imagine you gathered at lunch the other day with IST that you should work on it only during weekends and other free hours.

That in turn leaves the question of the current status of the "Stalin" biography and of the Stalin photo-book.

Re the photo-book. On the one hand, (1) Joe is very keen to get the photo-book finished as fast as possible, and (2) the friend who was mentioned to you at lunch the other day / Lunson / is interested in it, and (3) we have already got a good deal of it done, - the some 225 photos already on hand, etc. and (4) perhaps most important: it could be completed in less time than would be required to complete the biography.

> ![Shubs' signature]

/JBHII: I wrote him yesterday, when sending him the Locke paper, to be particularly careful not to say anything at all to anyone about "the friend who was mentioned to you at lunch (Lunson).

/JBHII: Please note the security angle in what follows. Also, the project to have one or both Shubs complete the "Stalin" biography, in re which I have the full file, has been batted around from Olmstead to Kelley

to 1ST, and there is or was a contract with Vanguard.

First, I was instructed to draw up a project to subsidize David Shub to complete the biography. Later I was told that Boris had been sent to NY, with instructions to complete it himself.

1ST, a few days ago, told me he was under the impression that you had worked out arrangements with Boris in re the biography. But you haven't. Neither Has Kolley, nor Kramer, and Bill Rowland (to whom 1st referred me). I know of no one else in OIC from whom Shub should be receiving directives.

Therefore, let's take time to get it cleared up, on paper, what is the status of Shub pere et fils re "Stalin".

Re "Stalin" biography. On the other hand, we are not clear what is the current status of the biography, (1) do you have any written directives from us about it, and (2) what are your and your father's current obligations to Vanguard as to completing it?

An important question is: if you complete the photo-book first, are your obligations to Vanguard such that you would have security difficulty in explaining to them why, and on whose behalf, you were delaying two months (more or less) to finish it, before resuming work on the biography.

Since the photo-book and the biography have the same subject-matter,

I suppose there is a bare possibility that you could work on the photo-book during "office" hours, while collaborating with your father on the biography evenings and weekends. But that does not seem a happy arrangement. We are called on for weekly Progress Reports, and Vanguard would be wanting to know what gives, and why. Much better to concentrate on one job at a time, and be under obligations to only one crowd at a time.

Status of the biography. As far as anyone here knows, you have only oral instructions to complete it. According to my rough notes of a talk we had July 31, you had a contract with Vanguard, July '49, calling for a book "by David & Boris Shub" to be completed March 1, 1950. And as of June 10, your father had had a $900 advance on it.

Would the copyright be in your name, or both? I think it would be

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 94

simplest to have the actual copyright in your name alone (ho could
assign his share to you), so thit any arrangements for foreign publication
could be riade with the minimum delay over the legal and security aspecte.
If I got it right, as of July 31 you had about 100 pages in pretty
auch finished form, about 70-80 pages in rougher draft, plus Chapters IV & V
the typescript of which was circulated höre (and which I mailed back to you
Oct. 5). Anyway, you thought there would have been an absolute minimum
of 3 solid months more k full-time work in it for your father. All in all,
if you were working on it whole-time and your father part-time, would a
minimum of 3 and maximum of 8 be about the right estimate?

(It's so much better, and better reading, than the Doutscher, it
ought to come out as soon as possible. Incidentally, have you considored
that the "Atlantic" or "Harper's might print chapters of it in advance?
Chapters IV & V are certainly highly readable.)

Ro completing photo book. what time do you estimate it would take
you, whole-time, to do a photo-book worth doing? (Say between 100 and 200
photos?). I should think an absolute minimum of a month, and much more
likely 2 or 3 months in actual practico, wouldn't you?
You probably noted that "Life's WN II Picture History" occupied the
fused talents of Life's entire photographic and editorial staff."
But yours would be only 150 or 200 photos, and you have almost all the
caption material in your head or on your desk, so perhaps, with a coope
rative publisher and cooper tive photo agencies, 2 or 3 months full-time
work would do it?

Dear Headley (proudonim)
Dear Boris,

Re "The Choice". I hope the Overseas Press Club panel was a success.

Nothing in the My Times" about it, but they don't usually write up those affairs. -I've seen nothing further in the "Post", o since the mention in the ed I sent you; will send you anything I see..

I have a complete file, "The Choice", here, with all the reviews, etc. in it. I went fully into the question of ordering copies, and it is clear that it is not policy anywhere to promote the distribution of it (or for that matter, equally clearly, any other book). After all, if the head man himself / Bedell Smith / had written "The Choice", there is nothing in his official charter that would authorize him to promote it in his official capacity; on the contrary. Nothing anywhere against you personally or the book; it's just that there is no policy to promote any book of that wide scope,

Therefore, as I imagine you gathered at lunch the other day / with IST/ work in connection with "The Choice" should be düring weekends and other free time.

I hope Winchell's mention of it, and the good Y Times" review, etc., will help sales, and that if it hasn't gotten off to a fast start, it will develop as a creeper "sleeper"

Re "Stalin" biography and/or Stalin photo-book.

That leaves the question whether you are supposed to be working on completion of the "Stalin" biography or on the Stalin photo-book, er on both. what is your own proference?

On the one hand,/Joe is arxious to get the photo-book done, and (2) the friend who was mentioned to you at lunch the other day / Winson/ is interested in it, and (3) we have already made a beginning on it, and, perhaps nost important, (4) it could be completed in less time than would be required to complete the biography.

(Incidentally, please be particularly careful not to say anything to anybody about the publisher who was mentioned at lunch. (Swen. It could raise a really first-class stirk. 1 inson thinks other publishers, would raise hell if they found out the Government had gone into competition with them. Very important).

On the other hand, what are your and your father's current security obligations x to Vanguard, in re the Stalin biography, and would you have difficulty in explaining to Vanguard why and on whose behalf you were taking two months (more or less) to do the photo-book, before resuming work on the biography? If so, that might be an argunent for completing the biography first.

Please give me all relevant details as to the current status with Vangard,
As far as anyone here knows, you have only oral instructions to complete the biography. According to my rough notes of a talk we had July 31, you had a contract with Vanguard, July '49, calling for a book "by David & Boris Shub" to be completed March 1, 1950. And as of June 10, 1950 your father had had a $900 advance on it.

The copyright would be in your name, or in your father's also. I think

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 99

it would be simplest to have them in yours alone from the start (or he could assign his to you), so that arrengoments for foreign publication / perhape by Swen/ could be made with the minimum delay mong cor the legal and security aspects.

If I got it right, as of July 31st you had about 100 pages in pretty much finished form, about 70-80 pages in rougher draft, plus Chapters IV &
the typescript of which was circulated here (and which I mailed back to you Oct. 5). Anyway, you thought there would have been an absolute minimun of 3 solid months more work in it for your father. All in all ring you were working on it whole-time, would a minimum of 3 and maximin of 8 months be about right? (It's so much better, and so much better reading, than the Deutscher, I think we ought to get it out as soon as possible. Incidentally, have you considered that the "Atlantic" or "Harper's might print chapters of it in advance? Chapters IV & V are certainly highly readable).

What time do y ou estimate it would take you, whole-time, to do a photo book worth doing? (Say between 100 and 200 photos?). I should think an absolute minimum of a month, and much more likely 2 or 3 months in actual practice, wouldn't you?) I have bean keeping a file of everything done in the to produce the the 1,000 photos of photo-book line, such as "Life's Picture History of World War II" and "The Life of F.D.R. in Pictures", and note that/the former occupied "the fused talents of Life's entire photographic and editorial staff". Yours would be only 150 or 200 photos, and you have almost all the caption material in your head or on your desk, so perhaps, with a cooperative publisher and cooperative photo agencies, 2 or 3 months hard work would do it?

One of the most dramatic pictures in the book shows half a page of a typewritten letter. Man name: Einstein is writing a man named Roose velt, ca Aug. 2. 1939. The letter begins: Sir: Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Salard which has been communicated to me in manu- script, leads me to expect that the element ura- nium may be turned into a new and more im- portant source of energy in the immediate fu- ture...". The free worlds immediate future" has been immeasurabiy lenghtened because Einstein wrote that letter.

Winston Churchill, who is writing the greatest continued story of our day, said in THE NEW Toek TIMES last Thursday that it is easier to infuriats Americans than to cow them" He was speaking of the havoc the U-boats made along our coasts in 1942, when the war came very close to America, as you can see by this book's picture of an American tanker torpedoed off the Jersey shore. You can also appiy. Churchill's observation to many other pictures, particularly those of the black days after Pearl Harbor. The book's last shot shows a combat veteran who might be in Korea today. The final text by Mr.p Dos Passos is: "The Pacific phase of the second of the world wars of the bloody twentieth cen- tury had ended, but its ending brought no peace."

In his own new book. "The Prospect Before." which contains stuff he first wrote for Life and for Harper's Magazine, Mr. Dos Passos: exrands on that. He takes us all over the wartime and post-war map, to Akron and Argentina England and Brazil, Lima and Kansas City. He arranges his bursting briefcases full of material into a series of lectures complete with Lecklers and other askers of penetratingly trofclesome ques- tions, that become light-heavyweight bouts with the leading problems of the world. What shall we do about capitalist cartels and Communist trusta? How can the institutions of democracy be safeguarded in a world where security is in short supply? What must we do to be saved? Little man, little world, there's little time. The battle is still on

EMPHASIS: This project is to produce a book of animal photos with satirical anti-Communist captions for publication in France. It is being developed with the assistance of Clarence A. Barnes, author of the best-selling "Home Sweet Zoo" and other photo-books. Twenty-one captioned photos have been submitted to a French publisher, who has indicated willingness to re-consider publish. These photos have been recalled, so that a final selection may be made from among them and 59 further photos must supplied by Mr. Barnes. If the French edition is successful, editions in other areas are contemplated. $6,000 has been allotted to publishing this book, with approximately $600 obligated to date; and an additional $40,000 has been set aside for publishing similar books. *XX*/ Earliest publishing date 6 weeks; latest estimated at Jan. 1, 1951/*. If there are editions in other countries, this project will be active for more than one year, and it may be necessary to subsidize the publishers in order to obtain the desired distribution.

This project, which will be a sub-project of KIFREY, has not been formally drafted, but is being developed. The project is to prepare and publish in the U.S. a book of photos and text on the career of Stalin, with the expectation of very widespread foreign distribution to follow. Mr. Robert M. Headley, CIA contract agent, is at work on the book; more than 200 photos have been assembled; a legal agreement concerning copyright and royalties between CIA and Headley was signed Sept. 16. Cost of 150 photos at $6 would be $900; any profit in the form of royalties will be returned to CIA.

"STALIN" PHOTO-BOOK PROJECT (to be named KICKNOUT)

Is a project for preparation of a book of photographs-plus-text on the career of Stalin.

When formally written up, it will be titled KICKNOUT, and will be a sub-project of KAFURNI, requiring only the approval of IST.

Some photographs have been assembled, from CIA Graphics and from agencies in N.Y., and a legal agreement has been drafted and signed, between/ CIA and Robert H. HEADLEY (pseudonym for B.S.), who will prepare the book for publication in the U.S. under his own name, retaining the copyright, which (together with royalties) he will assign to CIA.

Mr. Headley is now working on the book. It is planned that, after publication in the U.S., there will be editions (some perhaps subsidized) in many foreign areas.

I assume you have the details on this.

EXRADIO

I am listed as responsible for this, but know nothing about it. (I am going to look at the file today). Ray Lillard and LST know about it.

"STALIN" BIOGRAPHY

This, I believe, is not technically a project. But I understand that Robt. H. HEADLEY, contract agent, has instructions from IST, after finishing the "Stalin" photo-book, to complete a biography of Stalin, for publication in the U.S. under his own name; with the expectation of foreign editions to follow.

Re PHOTO of a panel of distinguished literary figures, artists, musicians, etc., who have been banned in USSR, are exiles, and/or became disillusioned with the "Soviet experiment".

Dateline Berlin, Aug. 16, '50. The West Berlin "Volksblatt" reports that the SED has forbidden the works of the following to appear in official entertainment programs or in public libraries in the East Zone:

Andre GIDE: "an enemy of the Soviet Union"

Ignace PADEREWSKI: "a Polish reactionary chauvinist and enemy of the Soviet Union"

Igor STRAVINSKY: "implacable enemy of the Soviet Union"

Arturo TOSCANINI: "rootless, with Western tendencies" [^1]

R. M. RILKE: whose work is "sterile and unpopular"

Stefan GEORGE: "a decadent dreamer and champion of the Germanistic infallibility myth"

Jean-Paul SARTRE

### Musicians

To what extent any or all of them left the USSR for primarily political reasons I don't know (do you), but taken in all, with the caption pointing out "It can't be a coincidence that all these men preferred to get away from and stay away from the USSR", they'd make an impressive gallery:

STRAVINSKI RACHMANINOV KOSTELANETZ
HOROWITZ KOUSSEVITZKY KURTZ
ELMAN BARER MEDTNER (?)
HEIFETZ BRAILOWSKY HILSTEIN
GOLSCHMANN? (b.Paris) GARBOUSOVA MOISEIWITSCH
PIATIGORSKY SEVITZKY STERN ZIMBALIST
ETC. ETC.

# Photos of MVD officer, or

# Photo: PIROGOV (as on the cover of his book; Duell, Sloan) 6 Oct. 1950

# Caption: a quote from him, such as (from the jacket of the book):

"The Soviet major and the American colonel personified two worlds, two worlds between which I was to choose.

"One was my country where everything was infinitely dear to me: her breadth, her limitless abundance, her simple, kindly folk who can sing in times of sorrow as in times of joy.. Scores of friendly faces flashed across my mind, scores of people I should never see again.

"But then all of that was blanketed in mist and all I saw was the sleek mask of the Soviet major sitting across from me. The cold, rigid features expressed all I detested: cruelty, contempt for the sufferings of others, the fear and sham of everyday life, the cheerless toil, and the perennial threat of tyranny."

"The alternative was an alien land America where I should be a stranger,.. but where I should at least be free..

"But I did know that I could no longer live in the land of my birth, live as a slave among slaves, conscious of my impotence to help them or myself.."

Comment: this quote could of course be pruned, retaining little more than the underlined bits.

Here is text which, joined to a photo of a particularly repellant MVD type, will do something to put across how the MVD is detested.

/ Sure, he's an anti-Stalinist, but that's Stalin's fault, not ours. You could add, if it seems necessary, as he and Ada Siegel point out, that there are thousands like him, and the only reason we don't hear from them is that it's a rare & lucky & plucky man who has a plane handy for escape. /

## ?? Photo of TROTSKY and/or LENIN

Caption: quote from Trotsky's letter to Chkheidze, 1913, describing Lenin as "this professional exploiter of all the backwardness in the Russian working class movement." (MS manuscript, p. 120).

Comment: several photos and quotes of this sort to expose the myth of one-big-happy-family life among the Communists, whole-souled in their adoration of Big Brother. A Trotsky quote such as the above could be used in conjunction with the Stalin quote on the "ordinariness" of Lenin, and the Lenin quote on the "roughness" of Stalin. And throw in two or three more and you have a striking (and amusing) little

Section on the Politburo as just a Band of Brothers, happy home life among the Communists; the CC (circa 1924, anyway) a snake-pit; band of backbiters and backstabbers

2 x 3 equals 6 photos would give an exhibit of each of the three Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky backbiting each of the others.

Then these could be followed with the photo of Trotsky shot dead after stabbing by Stalin's assassin, which in turn could be followed (or the whole preceded by) photo of Dostoevsky with the quote:

"Brothers will begin to cut each other's heads off in order to obtain brotherhood."

## ?? Photo of DOSTOSSKY

Caption: an appropriate quote from him.

Orville Prescott reviews "Fyodor Dostoevsky" by R. Fulop-Miller, 137 pp., $2., Scribners, in "My Times", Oct. 6, and quotes:

"Brothers will begin to cut each other's heads off in order to obtain brotherhood... It is madness to want to bring about a new era and a new humanity by sacrificing a hundred million heads..."

He says there are "many amazing prophecies...of the tyranny of the totalitarian state."

I imagine you have read most of Dostoevsky, and would know other quotes as good as or better than the above.

Just FYI

"As Russia Sees It". MARCH OF TIME, Aug. 1950

28 Sept. 1950

Presents an analysis of the world situation today, from the viewpoint of the Kremlin. It evaluates the opportunities for conquest as Stalin and his henchmen see them, and shows why the Soviets chose to take action now in Korea rather than elsewhere.

It also shows how the U.S. is meeting the challenge in Korea; the mobilization of manpower and industry; the reactivation of planes, tanks, and ships laid up since the end of WWII; and the actions which the US is taking with other members of the UN to check permanently the aggressions of Stalin and his Communist satellites. Running time about 22 minutes.

Of course through someone such as Jensen, Time and/or Life could provide stills from this.

[To Shub]

As you probably saw in yesterday's *N. Y. Times Book Review*,

SIMON & SCHUSTER will be the publishers this fall of *"The Life of FDR in Photographs and Text"* (sic) by Stefan Lorant, and of *LIFE's Picture History of World War II!*

Also Boris Shnab has a book coming out on *"the cold war and propaganda"*.

Are you sending complimentary copies to Drew Pearson and to Bernard Baruch? The latter's recent article in *"Look"* had a sentence or two faintly, but only faintly, along the lines of the choice.

If you have a copy to spare, why not send one to Gen. Wedemeyer, c/o Pentagon; he's the one who maintains the first *sine qua non* is to have a political policy.

Re your MS. P is in bed with some kind of fovor. He got dick today to take the MS to Floyd McCaffery, chief of research for Republican Nat'l C'ee, who will give it to the Col. Fellers tho wrote the "How to Beat the Rustians" article in the current "Colliers".

Elliston (Washington Post) has hea the MS, at any rate of the last chapter. P rang Kay Halle, his sec'y, to ask her to tell him it should get all possible publicity.

Don't worry too mich (except in your capacity as a tex-payor, otc.!) about the sales. Cre Elliston reading it means more than the thousands reading the "Worlds in Collision" tripe, which even Churchill can't dis lodge from #1 on the Best Seller list.

Re photo-book. Fleese keep such screeds as I sent, for any possible future cross-reference.

They are mainly grains of sand dropped in to contribute to the pro- duction of the pearls. (That smile seems better, the more you think of it, don't you think?)...

Re Slave-labor: I suggests possible use, lacking photos, of drawings such as the enclosed from Sept. 18 NY Times Book Review by Korolkov (Stalin Prize winner!) and said to be artist of very high celibro. Don't throw it away. Wait & see. A number of his drawings appeared in *Life* a year or two ago; I've seen them, but there is no clue to the date, so you'd have to ask *Life*.

Important: J says "Ask Littauer to tell Jenson about it". Of course Littauer will know to what extent you can sound out two different publishers simultaneously, should you already have approached Doubleday or another.

Jensen's still being on *Life* ("leave of absence") sounds fine, but Littmer will lmow whether he (Picture Press) could handle production & advertising as well as Doubleday?

Scratch my stuff abort à possible Miss photo in my screed of Sept. 15; had no time to proof-read it...

Enclosed what look to mo offhand 3 or 4 highly possible quotes from Karenev & Zinovior, from frontispiece of *Murder in Moscow*.

Think that Korolkov idea is worth keeping in mind. You could play up the angle: there are no photos, and they bleat about the "worker's paradise" and refuse all UN inspection committees, make survivors swear to say nothing about the camps. It is Joe's fault there are no photos on this page, but this gives an inkling of what itas like, etc.

Korolkov being a stalin prize-winner adds greatly, it seems to me.

Item, Photo of SHOSTAKOVICH, name familiar in every country, with just as caption the three lines of his abject, conical recantation.

Bedell Smith's book, p. 298. You could also quote PROCANFIEV.

Thanks for postcard. Best regards.

Caption: "I know that the party is right, that the party wishes me well, and that I must search for and find creative paths which lead me to Soviet realistic popular art."

Why shouldn't there be photos also of PROKOFIEV and KHACHATURIAN, world names, much more living than Zinoviev et al, with as captions quotes from the incredible *resolution* by the *Central* Committee, condemning the "degenerate, formalistic, bourgeois" music, Redell Smith pp.296-8.

If you were given complete license to invent anti-Stalin material on the fate of the Arts in the USSR, how could you better this?

Will send brief suggested quotes from those pages shortly.

## XX

"To choose the victim, carefully prepare the blow, satisfy an
implacable vengeance, then go to bed... There is nothing sweeter
in the world."
(Stalin to Dzerjinski and Kamenev in the course of a conversation
held in the spring of 1923.)

"You think that Stalin is worrying himself trying to find a
reply to your arguments? You are mistaken. He is only considering
in what manner he can suppress you without danger to himself."
(Kamenev to Trotsky in 1923.)

"He would have got rid of you at any moment since 1924 if he
had not feared reprisals from the youth section in the form of
terrorist activities. That is why Stalin has decided to start by
destroying the framework of the opposition and then to kill you
afterwards, when he is sure of being able to do so with impunity."
(Zinoviev to Trotsky in 1925.)

"If we die suddenly, let it be known that it is the work of
Stalin."
(Zinoviev and Kamenev in letters placed in safe keeping after their
rupture with Stalin in 1925.)

TO BORIS SHOB.
15 Sept. 1950

Just thinking out loud. If you care to call it thinking. Call it "revolt in the provinces", "Trotzivist deviationiem" if you like. Dut don't let it upset your digestion.

This will be a wonderful book. Really woll done, it should sell several hundred thousands in the U.5. alone (and Canada). At $1 the 3 "Zoo" books sold 700,000-plus. Even at $2.50 ar $3,, I very much doubt that you could do the job as it should be done for $1- it should have a a big sale. There is a crying need for it, in the US. alone. It is almost fantastic that there hasn't long sincs been a "Stalin-in-pictures" book. (But then there was no Life", to paralle the London Illustrated News" until circa 1932). There is a great thirst for really readable, believable information on what makes Stolin and the USSR tick. You are ideally set to fiil it.

Just tell the story of "Stalin" (the blog) in plotures, with as mich vordage as is necessary and no more. The sovereign virtue of photos is that people who wouldn't crack a book of solid print will read a page or half page of print, if need be, if there's a photo alongside it. (Cf. the book "The Photographs of Lincoin", where I found myself reading the entire printed parte, which I wouldn't have bought nor road without the photos). Letla add to your favorite erica,

The Dest Photograph tells its own story the corollary "An arresting photo will carry reader-interest for quite a bit of caption".

"THE STORY OF JOSEPH STALIN". Just tell the story. What he did. What be is doing. Properly done, that will leave the reader with the feeling of rovul- ston & distrust as to what he will do next, the sups with the devil must have a long spoon.

All the world loves a story. And what a story this is. As a reviewer of Deutscher said (the NY Times", I think) "After all, it's the 'success' story of the 20th Century. From cobbler's cottage zat to the Kremlin where he is

still pulling the wool over the eyes of an aimed-at 400 million signers of a Potition in the name of "peace" (with the largest standing army in the world's history) and mouthing "democracy" (while holding down more than 15,000,000 slave laborers in his own country alone). And your readers won't learn (millions of 'em don't know) he has more than 15,000,000 slave laborers unless you tell them. Not screaming at the top of your voice, but tell them. And no harm in giving the figure "15,000,000" more than once, if it proves convenient. Repetition is no sin..

In fact repetition can be dandy, Witness the world-wide best seller (second only to the Bible, (a mighty repetitive book itself) Anderson's fairy tales. Plenty of repetition in them. If the story is good, the theme gripping, the reader laps up the repetition; if the Wicked Uncle is wicked, it's more than OK to keep on saying (or, in your case, showing) it. And you've certainly got a story, and the Uncle is wicked, Let's show it, by any and every truthful means that doesn't detract from readability.

Re Repetition. I'm sure there is a lot in what I says. That when you are writing for mass readership, you ought to use a good deal of repetitions "I am going to tell you the story of how.......So here is the story.....So that was the story." After all, that is the time-tested fairy story technique, and they are the world's best sellers.

So why should we shy away from (a) repetition, or (b) calling the spade a spade, dotting the i's and crossing the t's. If you don't/cross your t's pretty vigorously & regularly, a lot of woolly-minded readers are going to have a breathing space in which to say: Still, he had his dear old mother up to stay with him in the Kremlin, so there must be some good in the man; and Byrnes (a Catholic) writes that he is undeniably a 'likable' fellow." Of course, you will anticipate & counteract that with photos of Big Brother accepting bouquets from schoolgirls, juxtaposed with photos showing Big Brother in a...

much less happy light.

The Unclor wore Picked, and Orima said so, Stalin is history's greatest slave-master. Say so. It's not an adjective. It's a fact. Throw the book at Idn. Dallin, Kravchenko, Pirogov. Anything and/or everything that it takes to ram home the fact. If you can do it without Kravchenko or any other "avowed anti-Stalinist" oo much the better, I entirely agree. But let's do it.

Stalin keeps the 15,000,000 hidden, so we've got few photos. So if you have to use a photo of a few slave laborers and caption that "there are millions like them," OK. Or use a "there is all this smoke, and it's because there is all this fire" argument; OK. i.e., if you have to use the cumulative technique of quoting a few sentences from Tchernavin and Dallin and Kravchenko and any others, let's do it. The fact of the slave-camps has got to be in there. If it isn't made credible you haven't told the story.

For example, re-read "Seeds of Treason". Chambers says that what made the scales fall from his eyes was "I SPEAK FOR THE SILENT" by Tchernavin. (I've never read it, and had forgotten it; you'll do no harm if you mention it some-where. Of course Tchernavin is an anti-stalinist). If that was good enuf for Chambers, it should be good for other CP readers, even, too.

What I'm getting at is: I DON'T **KILLHOME CRAMP YOUR STYLE BY ARBITRA-RILY RULING OUT THE USE OF "ANTI-STALINIST" WITNESSES**. Let the motto be: ANY truthful means that tell's Stalin's story is OK. He made the story, we didn't. It's his fault if you have to say: Pirogov was only one airman who escaped, and a more lieutenant, but there are thousands like him.

PIROGOV. Just a random suggestion, but I see no reason of principle why you shouldn't have, say: Photo of Stalin, sounding off about the worker's paradise, juxtaposed with Photo of Pirogov (a nice eloquent-looking type, smiling), and a quote from Pirogov (he's definitely eloquent, as you say) to the effect that he didn't like to leave his native land, but couldn't stick.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

it living "as a clave awong alaves". Cf. Ada Siegal, to the effect (in Preface) that there are thousands like him ("The Choico") and be is unusual arily is that ho had few close living relatives, and a plane, and ontoririo.

If it onund be done without the Pirogova & Eravchenkos, fins. But I'a oure you'll find khan you chain yourself to your desk and start owating blood over it that you just want to justice to (a) SLV-ABO and (b) LVD's EVE DY-DR ith just a photo of Borin, oven if he looked like a two-headed baby in a bottle. I just don't see how it can tegin to do tim to the adject. It wasn't any photo (though his first sight of Rytov in the flesh shook hia badly) that tok the scales from Chambers eyes, but the Tcharnavin story.

Also he was shaken by (a minor news iten in the lion Wheses) the proof that the Araalin ware Hara, bant a systematic, potty denigration of Trotaky. Anything -preferably out of their om souths, es you say that builds the THEY ALS WARS them is good.

There is so much to choose from, and it seems to mo that repetition is so good and, probably, so necessary, that I should say, an you do, thật a $1 book couldn't do the job. "white Collar Zoo is 60 pages in all, of which 74 pages have photos. 74 photos won't be auf, by a ling shot. The story is co absorbing, properly tail, that 15) or more potos wouldn't to a hat too much.

Ask & what about the coananion of "The Cardinal", where Simon & Schuster got out more than 400 pages of close print for only $1, with per cover, Perhaps no could get by for $2.50, if they felt assured of a large sale, And why shouldn't there be a large pale. You've got the real firt on Stalin, and the prestige of "Lonin". Give then Stalin' in pictures, with the minirava vordage, but em wordage. It will make Deutscher (and Tof, Carr) look like moral lepers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 130

Just another offhand suggestion: buy "Why I Escaped" and ask l. to re-read it, and see if she doesn't think there are some good brief anecdotal quotes in it. I.e., you could have a photo of a couple of ordinary USSR air-men, sitting at mess-table, or what have you, and a few sentences of conver-sation from Pirogov, -where the *[ILLEGIBLE]* man tells him he'd better inform on his pals, or else, -with the subscript: *-Peter Pirogov, Why I Escaped?*, page soiso. It wouldn't do any harm to advertise Pirogovs & Kravchenkos & Ichernavins anyway, all in the same good cause.

Item. On the left-hand page a photo of Alger Hiss montaged (or alongside) one of Mrs. Hede Massing (cf. her book) (she's quite photogenic I think) with caption quoting her on how Hiss & she agreed, after squabbling good-naturedly about interfering with each other's apparatus, "We're both working for the same boss". Then on the right-hand page, a photo of Roosevelt, Stalin, and Hiss, with quote from "Seeds of Treason" on how, at Yalta, at one point FDR, JV3 and Hiss (and one interpreter) were closeted together in the same room, (Roosevelt allegedly emerging saying, "I don't know how they persuaded me to give in, but I did"). There is probably a Yalta photo showing Hiss standing behind some of the others. Just an idea, but when you stop to think what may have been passing thru (a) Hiss's and (b) Stalin's mind at that little tete-a-tete, it might make a dramatic set of photos. But perhaps wouldn't really buttress any of the main theses.

"MURDER OF THREE DECADES". I'm getting it today. There may be some good caption material in it.

ILLUSTRIOUS DEFECTORS. No one of them, perhaps, is important enough to deserve a photo. But how about devoting two or three pages to photos of the 2 or 3 dozen most illustrious figures who have been admirers of the Soviet system & then become disillusioned? Taken all together, they ought to make a pretty impressive gallery: Gide, Koestler, Mann(??), Silone, etc. etc. etc.,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 131

and you could have a quarter-page of caption giving a one-sentence quote from each of them (…"a soviet-ridden slave-camp""...more totalitarian than any Hitler"…etc), or a single caption to the effect admirers of "The light that Failed”. After all, when one side “defects” it may not be much, but when they all do, sooner or later, it makes a pretty telling point, and a point which will have a multi-national and racial appeal (Silone, Gide, Richard Wright, etc). Throw the book at the bastards. Don’t miss any tricks. If you have a good brick right at hand, why not throw it. (“Any stigma is good enough to beat a dogma”, as someone erroneously said).

"LENIN": a wonderful book, and perfect for selling by the thousands to the Kernovitches & Bullitts & Bedell Smiths. But remember the photo-book editions should total in the millions, for the ordinary reader everywhere. That’s why, if I may harp on it, I think it should lean towards the tone & style of Grim’s fairy tales, where you don’t read very far before you know the Uncle is wicked, or strongly suspect it. Therefore the photo of Lenin with the quote “use any dodge, ruse or deception” would be an excellent frontis-piece. Offhand I should say YOU CAN NEVER AFFORD TO TRUST, BELIEVE THIS MAN" is the main theme, with "The more people let this man dupe them, the more this man seems *WAR* perhaps a close second. It’s their propaganda you’re combatting, and if you can show the reader *HE’S NEARLY ALWAYS LYING*, and for his sake not yours” you’ve just about done it.

Re *The STORY of Joseph Stalin*. Oot to tell it. There’s got to be a story, a more or less chronological narrative. But I don’t see, do you, how you can begin to tell the whole story; there’s too much of it; you could put the war against Finland in, or you could leave it out; there are too many areas and episodes of that order to put them all in. At any rate *not with photos*; i.e., if you decided to mention Finland at all, it might have to be just with literal-ly 2 or 3 words sandwiched in somewhere in a caption, where (and if) they would


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

haighten the effect. E.g., you might show photos of the taking over ("wel-coming back") of Latvia and/or Est. & Lit., and then add that "...since 1945 the USSR has been expanding at the rate of 65 sq. miles (or whatever it is) per day." (Since 1939, I think it is 65 sq. a per day. Can dig it up, — and let me know any other research you might want to have done). Then juxtapose it with Stalin's statement (1942) about 'not wanting an inch of anyone else's territory'. And throw in 'This is my last territorial demand' of Hitler, if it wouldn't clutter things up!.

Item. Alongside the frontispiece quote from Lenin, re "any deception", underneath it you could put Hitler's famous quote about the "big lie". Just because the idea of making the whole book a Hitler-Stalin parallel has been shelved, is no reason why you shouldn't draw the parallel wherever you see fit, if it heightens the effect.

More re: not telling the whole story, namely:

The Problem of the BIG FAMINE. Your telling the story of the Wicked Uncle, and heaven knows this is an important "episode" in it. Hard to see how it could be omitted entirely. And yet to deal with it is a problem. It is just the sort of problem that has been leading me to think you've got to lean on Text to do part of the job. I.e., the book is a PHOTO-book, and the pictures are the piece de resistance. But the beauty of really effective photos is that they heighten the effect, and carry you through patches where, unavoidably, no really arresting photo is available, —in which patches, I'd say, you're going to have to be content with an ordinary photo and lean at that point on your caption. Which doesn't worry me too much, because, after all, anti-Stalinist literature (and your own malicious mind) are fat not lacking in pithy & sizzling texts, such as alone will make the given page readable and memorable, (e.g., to pick at random a mediocre example: 'If the U.S.S.R. is a democracy, then Leavenworth Prison is a democracy'); nothing to write home about.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

but, with brevity, it paints a picture, after a fashion.) After all, words alone can paint *pictures*, nd evoke emotions, and as your taste aim is to evole an emotional fesponse, there's no need to creup your style with a self-imposed restrictior benntag the use of words, I should think the test would be; the reader wants to stop reading it in the middle, the caption, however true, is bady if you've held his interest to a pitch where he really wants to read is painting *pictures* in his own mind as he reads, then it's OK.

E.g., if you have the photo of the three purgees Rykov, K., & Z., and then coctime in your caption to the time "there was a bullet in the back of the head for X, and for Y, a for Z too" it will be, *faute de micux*, OK if the reader is already gripped to the point of nioturing to himself all these Com-rades being ground thru the mill of "opposition"-dasotion-arrest-cam-fession°death.

E.g. also, I'd strongly recommend, offhard, inclusion of the striking photo of Hindssenty, circles under his eyes, at the trial, and then you oxid add to the effect that he is merely the highest ranking of the.e.g., more than 12,000 Catholis ulergy who have been ingriscied in Crechoslovakia since 1948. (I have the figures).

Re *TIS FAMINE*, to got back to it. The best I can suggest is thet you could have either (a) one of the rare, if adeting at ail, photos, of a fanine socce or (b) a photo of a normal Village Scene, Harvest Scene, with the caption: It could have been live this, but Big Brother wanted an ORGANIZED FAMINE, phes the noot devastating quote you can got from the highest ranking nan-ati-Stalinist sources; and/or plus briel 143 banen interest quotes from Pirogov and/or Krav-chanbo, thereby you translate into hunen-interest tarss the cold statisties of several million dying of fardno.

*Have r FAMINE*. It's a problem, how to do it justice, and I'd suggest you have to & at least two trings: (a) malo it believable & bolieved, and

TOOFT


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 134

(b) heighten the emotional affect. If you succeed in (a), it will automati-
cally help uith (b). And I should think it would help toward (a) to put in
the points you were mentioning. Namely, to make a flat, quiet, sober statement
to the general effects "At first glauce it passes credibility that the rulers
of a great country would deliberately plan the mass-starvation of several
millions of their fellow-citisons and potential arms-bearers. But this is
exactly what they did, and they did it for two reasons (1) to break the poli-
tical power of the peasants, and (b) to get grain for valuta for machine tools."

The same method would be good (I think almost obligatory) in doing
Justice to SLAVE LABOR, I.e., you just quietly state that, whereas it may seem
too nightmarish that a regime could keep 15,000,000 slave-laborers stunted
like cattle, it's not the nightmarish product of an Orwell's imagination, it's
a fact, and it is done for the following cooly thoughout reasons...."
quote, either in substance or, preferably, verbatim, from I Change Justice, bottom
p. 238, where Kravchenko's NEVD school-mate gives the real reasons for
segregating potential trouble-makers and working them to death to get their
products for 1/5 the cost in the free market. A verbatim quote is by no means
essential (though i think quotation marks always liven a page) but I think
the EXPLANATION, unblushing proffered by you, the author of the photo-book,
is an almost essential ingredient. When you explain how the FAMINE and the
SLAVE-LABOR do make sense, to the Kremlin mind, you have (a) enhanced the
credibility, (b) gratified your reader, to whom, in many cases, as one or more
of these things (the TRIALS,e.g) may for years have been a source of puzzle-
ment, and (c) heightened the horror and the emotional response.

Cf. how "1984" builds up to quite a pitch of nightmare, but it is only
by dint of a good deal of explanation and repetition. (There is a great deal
more artistic exam economy in "Animal Farm", of course, and if you can make

Dick hopes to see you in person next weekend. Meanwhile entirely OK to go ahead. The copyright should be all in your name.

RE: AGREEMENT TO BE MADE BETWEEN OPC and SCBERT M. HEADLEY (pseud.)
in re publication of a book.

(1) Beadley is a covort CPC employse. He is cither a staff agent or a contract employee; Mr. Villard (ex-2798) can verify which.

(2) Headley — who is now engaged in preparing the book— is to approach a publisher in his own nare, and as a privato citizen.

(3) Thi book to be published under Bocaley's real name, with perhaps the addition of "...in collaboration with Blank / alloy's lay-out man, yet to be selected, if Headley feals tin layout dan deserves such crollt
Copyright to be held by lieadley, both US and foreign.
Royalties to be received by Headley.

(4) Headley to have dismotion in selecting a Lay-out assistant, than he will offer to pay either

(a) a fixed foo, helf down and half on publication; or

(b) the fixed fee, plus a parbantage of royalties; or

(c) a percentage of royalties.

Probably Headley will offer (a).

(5) The book to be published initially in the U.S. It is hoped that there will later be editions in many foreign languages, possibly subsidised,

(6) Royalties over a given period will be either omaller or larger than Headley's salary.

Hexiley is to turn over the gross royaltios to OPC — submitting the royalty statements or copies thoreof- less the difference between Headley'e income tax including royalties and the tax as it would have boan if he had not received royalties.
Headley should sibnit also a copy of his Income Tax return(s).

(7) Copyright to be assigned by lHeadley to CPC.

(8) Arraigament re royalties to be terrinablo. Royalties might continue to dribble in for soveral years, after ileadley might have severed his connection with OPC,
Therefore a claise is suggested to the effect: "at such time as the Government in its discretion may decide, the obligation on the port of Headlay to turn over royalties may be cancelled, and thereafter any royalties shall bo received by Headley for his own use."

(9) Headley should submit/written itemized statecents of all expenses chargeable to the project; receipts from his collaborator for payment of find foop oto, the contract with the publisher

(10) Headley to submit the final dumy for approval by an OPC representative.

Falling thase, I can make descriptive list of the CIA photos. It should not bo difficult to duplicato most of than in NY agencies, and the Shub ploturos are in any saco the lernol of the book/.

(3) Length of book. Not mich discussed. More important to sat the tons and dooide the maẫn thèng, Thirty-five pictures would anost certainly bo too fow; 150 might be OK.

(4) KUFUNNNY? Sims to clear with Fr. Thompson and Hillard shether the Stalin photo book sculd be done under KUFUNNY, which reads:
3. b. That the purposes of this projoon / antwal photos, with satirical captions, in many languages / bo approved in princindo and a cam of $40,000 be appropriated for the devolopment and distribution of similar photobooks at the discretion of Chief, SP."

Anyhow, letta got on with the book end, if necessary, amend AMFUNNY or write up a new project, lator/.

(5) Dook to ba prepered by Shah, working in NY. Period of 6 months work by Shub, as co-author with David Sub of biography of Stalin, to begin after completion of work ci photobuck,

(6) Stub' to approach rublisher as privato citizen, to hold copyright, take royalties, fur transmission to the account of KAFUNNY presumably. Presumably CIA's legal eagles are equipped to handle the income-tax as angles of this overt-covert set-up/
Book to be published under signature "Doris Shub".

(7) Collaborator for Shub in layout, JELI will give Shub & list of posuiblo helpors. JEILI mentionel Dick yang Soo Littauer, ask him for a good layout mang the best is the New Yorker's man, but he doesn't specia lise in photo media, you want a Life type man, they have better layout than Look.

(9) Publishor. JEIII: Duell would be loway. You'd get no advertising.
Sinon & Schuster would be toxocllent if you can get then to do it. Ask
Littuor to shop it around."

Sima mentioned Picture Fress, which ma doscribed in the WY TIPS
of 25 Juno 19501

"PICTURE PRESS is the novost shingle on Publishers Roa,
hanging from 270 Park Avenue, Editors are Joseph J. Therndilo, Jr.,
formar montaging editor of "Life", and Oliver Janson, on leave of absenco
from the magaziro. The firm will concontrate an sorious, inoxpansivo
photo-taxt books with a general interest and nowe slant.

JBIII to Shiba "Ask LST what he thinks about Jensen","n
(10) Mat type of book? Shubi It should be called "Joseph Stalin, and
to the casual reader it should lock, at first glanco, non-propagandistilo.
Then, as you look more closely at it, you see the degeneration of the systas,
in the faces, down to its present tertiary phaso", the ovolution frea
the early revolutionary dream of a botter life for Russia to the prosent
monster rogins. The lens captions in it the batter.

JULL: The main thao should be there are thoy now?", all
these individule and countries that have been outmansuvered and taken
over and liquidated by Stalin.

When you are writing for mass distribution, your toonique
should be: "I will tell you this, I an telling you it, I have told you 18".

Sims: The thread running through it, starting with Lenin, could bet
Cunning, plus Mouthleanean (one of Lenin's favorite words), plus compiote
Intolerance of any opposition to a vory narrow and constantly-being-purged
Kremlin clique. Horal (1) flobody can trust these people", and (2) "Because
they tolorato no opposition, they mean War".

A possible title, or sub-title might be "Half slave, half free?",
the quotation from Lincoln, which would the in with the campaign to poso
the USSR as the trus "resctionary and the US as the true "rovolutionary
champion of freedom./

Simbi As far as possible, the photos, and the sequence in which
they're arranged, should tell the story. CMI's war-time, 32-page photoboolt
on Hitler ("I am not crazy enough to want a war") ralies too much an captions.
We should make a book that lolotov & Stalin would squira when they road it,
and have no answer to. Then it will be good for publication anywhere."

• (11) Shub to move to NYC September 1.

(12) Shub to pay NYC associates $100
for the photos they have already obtained,
plus $200 on publication of the book.

(c) carries the implication(?): Couldn't his regime be overthrown?

Alternative covers: might be, tp put on the cover whichever photo proved most telling; the same photo to be printed also in its proper sequence in the book, at which point its meaning will become clear; e.g. the splendid photo of Stalin walking with, but apart from, Rykov, Kamenev & Bukharin, with its message: "this man bides his time, then treacherously strikes down all those 'comrades' who have ceased to be useful to him".

the weird photo of

LENIN'S FIGURE SILHOUSTEAD

OVAR THA RUSSIAN LANDSCAPK

Caption: "The existence of the Soviet Republic side by side with imperialist states for a long time is unthinkable. A series of frightful clashes between the Soviet Republic and the bourgeois states is inevitable."

To which might be added: (1) Stalin's statement, circa 1945 that the bourgeois & Soviet states can co-exist, and (2) Stalin's statement of 9 April 1947 to Stassen: "Lenin is our teacher, and we Soviet people are Lenin's disciples".

Comment: Somebody's Iringa. Photo suggests the peaceful Russian landscape, docinated by this founter (Lenin) of a dictatorial aliqme, whose dogation, intolerance and ballicosity are enggested by auch werde as "unthinkable", "inevitable", "frightful clashes".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 159

photo of LENIN:
Just any ordinary photo;
seated at his desk, or
in any inactive pose.

Page 1.2

Caption:
"I had...fancied Lenin as a giant, stately
and imposing."

"How great was my disappointment to see a most
ordinary-looking man, below average in height, in
no way, literally in no way, distinguishable from
ordinary mortals."

--Stalin.

Comment: Crankshaw says: "This impression of a man so great
that he could afford to appear ordinary
was one which Stalin found it necessary
to obliterate from the consciousness of
Soviet citizens."

Therefore let's revive it.

This will tie in, of course, with Lenin's Testament; "find a
way to remove this man.."

> [Figure: Photo of Plekhanov. The text below the image says: (we haven't got; can be obtained)]
> ![photo of Plekhanov]

Caption to the effect: *"Georgi Plekhanov, one of Lenin's oldest disciples and collaborators, of whom Lenin said in 1924:"

"No one is a true Bolshevik who does not know Plekhanov"* (or words to that effect which I've read somewhere), and who told his wife, when the Red Guards forced their way into his house, November 13, 1921:

*"How little you know these people!

They are capable of hiring an assassin to kill me and shedding crocodile tears after my death to arouse people's emotions."*

Comments:

We want to drive home the fact, unknown to most readers, that Lenin was bitterly opposed by some of his oldest collaborators; that there were (and are?) schisms even in the inner core; that what fastened itself on the back of the Russian people was a clique that was *"capable of all ruthlessness;"* of anything that would serve its main end: to remain in power.

The quotation also brings out Soviet *"crocodile"* hypocrisy.

photo of KRONISTADT?

(we haven't, can be got)

Captions to the effect: this is the island fortress off Petrograd, from which the Bolshevik's own creme-de-la-creme marched against Kerensky in July 1917; stormed the Winter Palace in November to put Lenin in power.

Bolshevik
Here, on March 1, 1921, 15,000/sailors and soldiers revolted against Lenin's regime, and dispatched a radio message to the world:

"The first shot has thundered. But the entire world knows of it. The bloody Field Marshal Trotsky who stands up to the waist in the fraternal blood of the workers was the first to open fire against revolutionary Kronstadt, which rebelled against the government of the Communists in order to re-establish the real power of the Soviets. We will rise or fall under the ruins of Kronstadt, fighting for the bloodstained cause of the laboring people. Long live the power of the Soviets! Long live the world Socialist Revolution!"

Marshal Tukhachevsky described the outcome:

"I was in the war for five years, but I cannot remember such a slaughter. It was not a battle; it was an inferno... The sailors fought like wild beasts. I cannot understand where they found the might for such rage. An entire company fought for an hour to capture one house and when the house was captured it was found that it contained two or three soldiers at a machine-gun. They seemed half-dead, but they snatched their revolvers and gasped, 'Too little did we shoot at you scoundrels.'"

Comment: "shows 17 has been done, - a revolt of 15,000, nearly four years after Lenin came to power.

The average reader knows nothing of the fact this revolt occurred, and should be reminded.

Tukhachevsky, incidentally, adds an item of "continuity" to the story, since further on there is a photo of him, as one of those executed.

Note: the above would admittedly make a lengthy caption; but a vivid idea and necessary, because there is no photo (presumably) in existence of the actual revolt, and the fact it occurred should be driven home.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Conference of JBIII, Shub and Sims, Aug. 25. re "STALIN" photo book.

(1) Some 202 photos were examined; the best, about 67, obtained by Shub in NY, the others furnished by CIA Graphics; plus some magazine articles with photos, supplied by Jim Williamson.

(2) Sims is to do utmost to get clearance by CIA Graphics for maximum use of their photos by Shub: clearance, if possible, for Shub to take the photos to NY (probably not possible); and/or duplicates minus CIA markings; and/or lists of the sources from which CIA got them. / Failing these, I can make descriptive list of the CIA photos. It should not be difficult to duplicate most of them in NY agencies, and the Slub picturec are in any case the kernel of the book //.

(3) Length of book. Not much discussed. More important to set the tone and decide the main theme. Thirty-five pictures would most certainly be too few; 150 might be OK.

(4) KMFUNNY? Sims to clear with Mr. Thompson and Millard whether the Stalin photo book could be done under KMFUNNY, which reads: "5 b. That the purposes of this project / animal photos, with satirical captions, in many languages / be approved in principle and a sum of $40,000 be appropriated for the development and distribution of similar photobooks at the discretion of Chief, SP."

/ Anyhow, let's get on with the book and, if noces sary, amend KMFUNNY or write up a new project, later /.

(5) Book to be pared by Shab, working in NY. Period of 6 months work by Shub, as co-author-with Sarit Shmb of biography of Stalin, to begin after completion of work on photobook.

(6) Shub to approach publisher as private citizen; to hold copyright, take royalties, for transmission to the account of KMFUNNY presumably. Presumably CIA's legal eagles are equipped to handle the income-tax angles of this overt covert set-up /.

Book to be published under signature "Boris Shab".

(7) Collaborator for Shub in Lay-out, JBIII will give Shub a list of possible helpers. JBIII, mentioned Dick Lyons "See Littauer; ask him for a good layout man; the best is the New Yorker's man, but he doesn't specialize in photo media; you want a Life-type nan, they have better layout than Look:

*   Pay him on a ono shot basis, a fixed foo. Toll him he geta à certain amount doich, and the same again if the book is published.
*   Jim Williamson says he would be glad to help on Layout, if there to difficulty getting anyone else /.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

(6) Publication to be in the US first, with a view to subsidization (if necessary) of editions (possibly abridgod) in Western Europe and elsewhere.

(9) Publisher. JBIII: "Duoll would be lousy. You'd get no advertising. Simon & Schuster would be excellent if you can get them to do it. Ask Littauer to shop it around."
Sims mentioned Picture Press, which was described in the "NY Times" of 25 Jure 1950:
"PICTURE PRESS is the newest shingle on Publishers' Row, hanging from 270 Park Avenue. Editors are Josuph J. Thorndike, Jr., former managing editor of "Life", and Oliver Jensen, on leave of absence from the magazine. The firm will concentrate on serious, inexpensive photo-text books with a general interest and news slent."

JBILI to Shib: "Ask LST what he thinks about Jensen".

(10) What type of book? Shub: It should be called "Joseph Stalin", and to the casual reader 11 should look, at first glance, non-propagandistic. Thon, as you look core closely at it, you see the degeneration of the system, in the faces, down to its present "tertiary phase", -the evolution from the early revolutionary dream of a better life for Russia to the present.. monster regire, The less captions in it the better.

JBILL: The main thomo should be "Where are they now?", -all these individuals and countries that have been outmaneuvered and taken over and liquidated by Stalin.

When you are writing for mass distribution, your technique should be: "I will tell you this, I am telling you it, I have told you it".

Sims: The thread running through it, starting with Lenin, could be: Cunning, plus "Ruthlessness" (one of Lenin's favorite words), plus complete Intolerance of any opposition to a very narrow and constantly-being-purged Kremlin clique. Moral: (1) "Nobody can trust these people", and (2) "Because they tolerate no opposition, they mean War".

A possible title, or sub-title might be "Half slave, half free?", the quotation from Lincoln, which would tie in with the campaign to expose the USSR as the true "reactionary" and the US as the true "revolutionary" champion of freedom.

Shib: As far as possible, the photos, and the sequence in which they're arranged, should tell the story. OWI's war-time, 32-page photobook on Hitler ("I am not crazy enough to want a war") relies too much on captions. We should make a book that Molotov & Stalin would equirm when they read it, and have no answer to. Then it will be good for publication anywhere,"

(11) Smib to move to NYC September 1.

(12) Shub to pay NYC associates $100 for the photos they have already obtained, plus $100 on publication of the book.

Re: "STALIN" PHOTO-BOOK.

Target: Stalin.

Basic theme: Stalin means WAR.

For publication in: to be suitable for publication in any country.
France to start with.

Item: ES: "It should be so good that Stalin himself couldn't answer it. Captions to be as far as possible genuine quotes from Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Molotov, under photos showing undeniable facts such as the assassination of Trotsky. Nothing phonsy. If we have a book that no one in the Kremlin can pick holes in, it will be good for publication anywhere in the world."

Item: ES: Target is Stalin and his regime. "It should not contain a line that would offend any non-Communist Russian".

Item: ES: Don't use any quotes from avowed anti-Stalinists such as Kravchenko.

Title: "Joseph Stalin", "This Man Wants 'Peace'", "This Man Talks Peace""Thirty-three Years of Peace", "The Trojan Dove".
ES: Don't let's worry about the title now.

Item: ES: K says there is a very striking contrast between photos of the Politburo leaders in the 20's and unretouched photos of them now, e.g. in the official 20-minute news-reel of May Day 1949 in Red Square, bloated fatcats. ES: It looks (28 June) as tho this news-reel, and stills from it, may be available. g: If it's technicolor, so much the better.

Item: ES: "Pictorial History of Russia" by John Stuart Martin.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

CONTENTS, suggested by BS:

(1) Photo of Tsar & Kaiser together.
Be-medalled.
(Three of them "Willy-Nicky" photos).

(2) Photo showing Devastation of World War I.
Corpses, refugees.
KS; preferably in what area? France?

(3) Photo: Lenin (genuinely) urging Peace.
Lenin on soap-box, with crowds carrying banners "Peace".
Caption indicating translation of Russian for "peace".

(4) Close-ups of Lenin & his Politburo in power.
Including one of Lenin & Trotsky (& Stalin?) together.
They wanted peace, what became of them? Followed by:

(5) Trotsky reviewing troops.

(6) Trotsky dead, with head bandaged.
Caption: quotation from Stalin to the effect "We owed much in 1917-18 to the organizing genius of Comrade Trotsky".

(7) / or (4)?/
- Lenin "a most ordinary-looking man".

Caption: Stalin's "How great was my disappointment to see a most ordinary-looking man, below average in height, in no way, literally in no way, distinguishable from ordinary mortals." (From Crankshaw article, "The Battle for Lenin's Mantle", in NYTimes mag., 25/6/50).

(7½) Photo Stalin.
Perhaps the unshaven one in Deutscher, or the one from his/Tsarist police dossier.

Caption: Lenin's 4 Jan. 1923 postscript to his Testament:
"Stalin is too rough...Therefore I propose that the comrades find a way to remove Stalin..." (Crankshaw article).

Title for BOOK?: "FIND A WAY TO REMOVE STALIN"-V.I. LENIN

(8) "Photo of USSR baing put on a war footing"

I.e., photo of
*   ? a collective farm?
*   photo of famine during the enforosd collectivisation?
*   photo of liquidated bilaks?
*   photo of a masa of tractors?

ES: the argument here is: The real purpose behind Collectivization was (a) to break the peasants as a political force, and (b) to put the country on a war footing: to get the grain, in order to get fomign exchange, in order to get war siechinery.

ES: this will need a cogent caption, to make the argument convincing.

LR. SUB-

(1) Re "STALIN IS HITLER" PHOTO BOOK, suggested by you 16 June.

(2) I have asked ISR to supply us with all available personality photos of Hitler & Stalin, i.e. "photos in which they appear in close-up -we might also have one of Red Square & Nuremberg/ receiving bouquets from little girls, visiting wounded soldiers, voting, pinning medals on generals, receiving visiting statesmen from dominated areas, with emphasis on photos showing the two dictators engaged in similar activities."

I have my doubts as to whether they will come up with a large number. It will probably also be necessary to draw on the big New York photo agencies.

(3) THE PROJECT. The book to be published, first, in France; then in other countries: Italy, West Germany, Holland, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, etc.

(4) OBJECT. Discredit Stalin. Reveal him as the ruthless master of a "spyridden slave-camp". Show him as worse than Hitler. More dangerous, because his poison is more exportable; more ruthless; more cunning. **Much more important to show he is planning aggressive war**

(5) BOOK TO BE COMPILED BY Williamson, in conjunction with SP. Williamson to be paid his fully daily rate, to enable him to neglect his regular work.

(6) BOOK TO BE SIGNED BY? Howard Hunt suggests, in France, some organization such as the Polish National Liberation Committee, or Federation of Iron Curtain Journalists; or NCFE? or FORCE ARRIERE? (The cat is the West)

It might be signed with some pan-European pseudonym such as "Stefan Mueller"?

(7) IS AMERICAN INTEREST IN THE BOOK TO BE CONCEALED?

(8) TO BE PUBLISHED BY? In France, a French publisher.

An excellent literary agent might be Gérard Boutelleau, Krav-chenko's literary agent, described on page 22 of "I Chose Justice".

(9) SUBSIDY. Estimates of production costs for this type of book have been made in connection with KM FUNNY. To insure widespread sale, a considerable subsidy would be necessary.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

# SECRET

(10) SIZE OF BOCK? A maximum of 75 pages of photos. This would give some 36 or 37 two-page sets of Hitler-Stalin photos.

(11) CAPTIONS? I think we will need them, and should have them; at least for a good many of the photos. (I think this will prove to be the case when you come to make up any actual dummy).

(12) Something a good deal more eye-catching and forceful, as a TITLE than the tentative "Stalin Is Hitler" should be forthcoming?

"Your Leader?" "Do you want this man?" "Slave master"

"Man of Steel, and blood", "This Man Wants War!"

(13) CAN 36 SETS OF PHOTOS SHOWING PARALLELS BETWEEN H & S BE PRODUCED? Undoubtedly yes. But:

(14) HOW MANY PARALLEL CLOSE UP PHOTOS CAN YOU SUGGEST?

I.c., we can have parallels showing each dictator receiving a bouquet from an awestruck child; parallels of each of them "voting", with suitably biting captions under each; parallels of Hacha on the carpet at Berchtesgaden, alongside some Satellite minister summoned to Loscow.

But how, with any close-up photos of H & S can you deal with such matters as Slave Labor, the Gestapo, the MVD. For these, it seems to me, it will be necessary to have non-close-up photos, i.e., photos in which H & S do not appear. But the parallel between the two regimes can be emphasized (a) in the Captions, and (b) by some such typographic device as:

(15) OVER-PRINT A SWASTIKA & HAMMER-SICKLE in the upper corner/of each set of non-close-up photos.

(16) GEXT? Captions, it seems to me, will be found necessary, and perhaps even some inter-leaved pages of parallel texts. E.G., you can have, on a left-hand page, a photo of Witzleben (and/or some of the other bomb-plot German Generals being executed in 1944) and on the right-hand page photos of Tuchachevsky and the 6 other Red Army generals who were executed along with him (with no photographers present) in 1937. But how can any photo of Tuchachevsky et al. begin to do justice to the subject of the Purge-as-a continuous-featuresof-Soviet-life-ever-since-1917????

"The first & greatest misunderstanding about the Purges has to do with their duration. To most Americans / also Western Europeans, he says, elsewhere: Kravchenko, "I Chose Justice", p.145/, a Soviet purge is something

exceptional, a violent phenomenon which they vaguely understand has happened
once, or several times perhaps, but is then over and done with. This is a
basic error. Purgos are part of the permanent machinery of the Soviet
regime. They are continuous and never-ending. There have been periods of
intensification.... But there has never been a period free of purging..."

How can we possibly do justice to Purges-under Stalin, as described by
Kravchenko in the ten pages 145-155, with a few photos? (Bren more so, how
do justice, with photos alone, to what it is like to live ander a regime
where "one person in every 7" is an AVD informer*?)
Therefore why not something such as:

(17) PURGE PHOTOS PUIS TERY?

Have one or two good, gruesome gallows photos: plus photos (per-
haps a half-dozen or more to a page) of several dozen major figures who
have been killed: Tuchachersky, 6 out of 7 of the 1924 (awa't it) Politburo
itself, the Jan. 1937 purgees ("all shot except Radek"), the frial of the
Twenty-one (Harch 1938: "all shot except Rakovski"), etc etc., plus Kostov,
Rajk, etc.

Then, between pages of photos, have a page of text, to drive
the Purging-is-continuous point-home.
We could, e.g., reprint the above-quoted paragraph from Kravchenko
(whose name every French reader would recognise), and some of the lists of
rurgees he gives on p. 148-9.

Then the gruesome photo (available?) of Trotsky sprawled across hio
desk after stalin's assassin had been at him with the meat-cleaver, which
would lead the reader on to perhaps one more page of text. And eye-catching
teart, not hard to read, in display fom:

POLITBURO Pyatkov......................shot
Rykov........................shot
Bukharin.....................shot

Trotsky........................assassinated

Kostov........................"deviationist": shot.
Rajk........................"deviationist": shot.
Dimitrov........................?
Vonesensky........................?

Thores........................ 195? ? ETC ETC ETC.

(18) A "SPY-RIDDEN" REGIMS.

To put this point across, in photos, seens offhand difficult.
However, it might be possible simply to have an ordinary photo of an ordinary
citizen, looking somewhat apprehensive, with underneath it a Caption consisting
of a single sentence from, e.g., Kravcherko:

".... Finally Donenko escaped. He found his wife and three children
living in the Doneta. Basin under a false name.
"No one-except my wife,' Donenko said, 'could know who I weally

was. I took lodging in their house as a stranger. My own children
called me uncle, and grew up without knowing that the man who boarded
in their house was in reality their own father." (I Chose Justice, p.506).

(19) KATYN & OSHWIECIM, etc. We can of course have parallel photos
here.

But a map of the USSR with a large black dot for each place
where there is a labor-camp, with caption underneath in very large type,
"15,000,000 and more!" might help to drive home the extent of slave
labor under Stalin. I can't see how any single photo of slave-laborers
can make the point.

There is such a map of the labor-camp locations in Dallin,
but it is typographically a very poor one, and it is devoutly to be hoped
that CIA Cartographic can come up with a better one.

(20) TUESDAY, June 27. WILLIAMSON is making a trip to Washington,
and should be in the office early in the morning. Could you meet with
him-then?

In preparing these photo books there seems to be nothing like
actually getting down to the preparation of a dummy. Could you prepare
some sort of rough dummy or List of Contents to submit to Williamson,
indicating the themes for which you would like to have the photos illue-
trate?

W. S. Sims

(19½) My tentative view in re this Photo Book might be summed up
as the "Seydlitz powder" theory. I.e., (1) a page of printed statistics
of purgées, alone, is no good; (2) a page with a gruesome gallows photo
alone is not good enuf, but (3) put the two together, and you have something
"graphic" to bring home to the reader what it would be really like to live
under Stalin.

CONGRESS FOR CULTURAL FREEDOM

Berlin, Germany
26 to 30 June, 1950

I. Origin and Parpose

Early in 1950 a plan vas conceived to gather together in Berlin, in the heart of Soviet Germany, a representative group of the Western World's intellectual leaders and to provide them with an inctrument to repudiate the totalitarian concept of intellectual subservience to the state. OFC planned to convene the Congress of Cultural Freedom in June 1950 at a moment most advanta-gecus to counteract the psychological effect of the Soviet-sponsored Whitountide-Youth Dally. The meetings and pronouncements of the Congress were to be widely publicized by prosa, radio and printed material not only to the Western world but by sustained clandestine distribution in coskunist-controlled areas.

II. Development

To achieve maximum effect and credibility, it was apparent from the outset that the actual sponsorship of such a convention should not de permitted to appear. Accordingly, the Congress for Cultural Freedom ostensibly sprang into being as the inspiration of a meeting between Irast Reuter, Lord Mayor of Berlin: Dr. Otto Suhr, Rector of the Berlin College of Political Science, and Dr. Redslab, Rector of the Free Caiversity of Berlin. Melvin J. Lasky, RICOG editor of the intellectual periodical, Der Monat, was introduced into the formative committee and nominated Acting General Secretary to steer the operation for OFC.

In the name of an international sponsoring committee[^1] invita- sions to the Congress were extended to prominent intellectual, cultural and labor figures of the Western World or in exile froz cosmunist-dotrinated Rastern countries. The complicated task of gathering together these widely-scattered individuals at the site of the Congress required the closest coordination with and coopera- tion of official and private United States agencies and individuals of many nationalities. The delicate matter of covertly financing the travel and expenses of delegates for example, had to be accomplished with the assistance of three American committees with estab- lished interests in international affairs. An enormous amount of organizational detail was handled in Berlin and elsewhere on the.. continent and in the U. S. under OFC sponsorship and direction. Provision of interpreters, press and redio coverage, an elaborate book display, accommodations for personal comfort and security of the delegates and facilities for the official business of the Congress, were among the problems which had to be solved.

OPC is particularly grateful to the State Department which, through the office of Mr. Bruce Buttles, rendered exceptional and sympathetic cooperation throughout the progress of negotiations and arrangements. This cooperation extended to letters from the State Departeant to invitees, backing up Committee invitatione, a general

to be supported by funds of CIC and delegates were characterized as American police spies and war mongers. In the U. S., considerable coverage was given by the N. Y. Times, N. Y. Herald Tribune, Baltimore Sun, Washington Star and other papers. Additional coverage is expected in periodicals in the form of reviews and feature articles.

In recording the opening of the Congress, the Christian Science Monitor referred to the fact that it was being held just one month after the Communists had staged the greatest totalitarian youth meeting ever held in Europe. The Monitor went on to say:

> There is as much difference between these gatherings as one can to imagined. The one emphasized numbers and blind obedience to collectivism. The other will be composed of a select company of noted public leaders and scholars from the western world and will stress the all-importance of freedom of expression and of human rights.

In its deliberations, the cultural and intellectual slavery imposed by the Soviet Union and her satellite states was emphatically and repeatedly denounced. The attack by North Korea was immediately seized upon by delegates and made the subject of vigorous repudiation. In this connection, it is significant that the delegates were not bound, limited, or instructed in any way. [^1] It was well known that one delegate, Dr. Hans Thirring, Austrian atomic scientist, had prepared a speech which contained a considerable amount of criticism of the Western democracies. The speech had been printed and distributed to delegates in advance of the session. When the Korean news

[^1]: While no control was exercised over papers and statements of delegates, it was necessary that the general course of business and tenor of the Congress be held within the bounds of the original concept. This was accomplished by an informal steering committee the key member of which was a highly respected, internationally famous delegate, who was also an OFC agent.

broke, he stood before the Congress and, amidst cheers, openly re-
pudiated his prepared document, stating that in view of the cynical
Korean Aggression he would confine himself to a denunciation of
communist despotism.

The Congress delegates represented many divergent backgrounds
and philosophies. They were free to express any opinion. Yet at
no period during the five days of discussion, debate and oratory was
there any critics of the U. S. or of its policy in the Far East.
U. S. policy was, in fact, vigorously defended by a number of dele-
gates, including Haakon Lie, noted Norwegian labor leader.

The Congress unanimously approved the following "Letter to the
East", a message to writers, authors and scientists behind the iron
curtain:

"The great conflict now raging in the world is not
a conflict between East and West. It is not a conflict
between peoples. We definitely reject the accusation
that we who have come together from many countries and
different parts of the world are hostile to the peoples
of Russia and the countries subjected to the domination
of the Stalin dictatorship. Quite the reverse: we
have amongst us representatives of those peoples.

"We are deeply convinced that the problem of the
freedom of the peoples who are today enslaved under
the Stalin dictatorship and the problem of ensuring
freedom and peace throughout the world are inseparably
linked.

"All those who fight for freedom against oppress-
ion can be assured of our unlimited solidarity."

Deliberations of the Congress concluded with a unanimous mani-
festo (see Tab A) in which the delegates rejected the idea of non-
trality in the struggle between freedom and tyranny and stated that
intellectuals should not stand silent on the sidelines but should

## IV. Future Plans

The first meeting of the Executive Committee, which will be controlled by OPC, is scheduled for Paris, in September, at which time arrangements will be made for future sessions of the Congress and the continued exploitation of its activities and the anti-communist declarations of its members.

OPC plans for the exploitation of this operation called for clandestine dissemination of the output of the Congress, especially its resolutions, speeches and manifestos, throughout East Germany and the Soviet satellites. East Germany has already been covered once, through a special edition of the Neue Zeitung and reports carried by other papers which the OPC mission subsidizes and secretly distributes in Soviet Germany.

Plans are now being perfected for circulation, in a number of languages, of millions of copies of the speeches, declarations and resolutions of the Congress. Much of this material has already been carried by the Voice of America and by Radio RIAS. Since the Congress has determined to perpetuate itself through a Continuation Committee, OPC will encourage additional statements and declarations by key persons, these also to be distributed throughout the satellite area.

Many millions of people, some of them cut off from any news of resistance to communist tyranny over the thoughts of men, will be informed that not only are the philosophers and scientists and cultural leaders of the world outraged at the attempted obliteration of intellectual freedom, but that they propose to fight it.

The project is a contiming one. There will be other sessions of the Cultural Congress and further dissemination of the voices of men who are free to say what they think and thus bring to those still enslaved the message that they too may hope to be free.

III. The Sessions of the Congress.

The Congress convened in Berlin on 26 June 1950 and consisted of more than 100 representatives of 16 nations. [^1] It was officially welcomed by the City of Berlin and was greeted with an outpouring of publicity in the European and American press.

The impact of the Congress on the prese of Europe cannot be re-corded fully at this time. Clippings and a complete operational re-pert have not yet been received from the field. There are many known indications, however, that it was furiously opposed by the communist press. Soviet-sponsored papers and Radio Berlin denounced delegates ae the hounds of dell Street and oven accused Congress members of setting fire to the House of Soviet Culture. The Congress was said

SUBJECT: American Ballet

TO: Chief, FJCAPS Washington, D. C. DFO: Chief, DRAFED

ATTN: Joseph E. Stribling

1 December 1950

1.  For the reasons outlined below, we have been forced to take emergency action on the following matters.

2.  During the period of preparation for FDQUICK; Hallison has in hand a project which involved bringing the American Ballet to Berlin for a brief series of performances in both the east and west sectors of the city. We encouraged him in this idea, since the performance dates coincided with FDQUICK, and would have added substantially to the culture surrounding the central event. Hallison, however, was faced with a complicated financing problem, since the business manager of the ballet company wouldn't accept marks, and Hallison had no dollars for such purposes. At that time we indicated, because of the advantage to FDQUICK, that we would resolve his difficulty by exchanging his money for him.

3.  For a variety of reasons, the ballet was delayed and couldn't include Berlin during the period in question. We regarded the deal as dead and put it out of our minds, but not Hallison. He chose to regard our commitment as open, and without consulting us until today, has obligated himself to pay 3050 green dollars to the ballet company, which is arriving in Berlin tomorrow, and whose business manager expects to be paid immediately on arrival. Both Hallison, and indirectly Balster, have appealed to us to take him off the hook. We have informed him that such deals are contrary to FJCAPE policy, and anyway our original reason for considering such assistance is no longer operative. But because he and his shop are extremely useful to us in a variety of ways, we have told him we might perform the service of exchanging his marks on the open market, citing a six-to-one rate as probably the best obtainable.

4.  Regardless of what Hallison has been told, we do not wish to involve this mission in local open market transactions. We are, therefore, exchanging from our funds here 3050 green dollars for 18,300 Deutsche marks from Hallison. He will, of course, obtain a mark receipt from the ballet company's business manager in order to keep his books straight, and no paper outside FCAPE files referring to this matter will exist. We believe this operation secure and not disadvantageous to FJCAPE from either a financial or influence standpoint.

SUBJECT: American Ballet

TO: Chief, FJCAFE
Washington, D. C.

INFO: Chief, DTRAPID

ATTN: Joseph K. Stribling

1. For the reasons outlined below, we have been forced to take emergency action on the following matters.

2. During the period of preparation for PDQUICK, Hallison had in hand a project which involved bringing the American Ballet to Berlin for a brief series of performances in both the east and west sectors of the city. We encouraged him in this idea, since the performance dates coincided with PDQUICK, and would have added substantially to the culture surrounding the central event. Hallison, however, was faced with a complicated financing problem, since the business manager of the ballet company wouldn't accept marks, and Hallison had no dollars for such purposes. At that time we indicated, because of the advantage to PDQUICK, that we would resolve his difficulty by exchanging his money for him.

3. For a variety of reasons, the ballet was delayed and couldn't include Berlin during the period in question. We regarded the deal as dead and put it out of our minds, but not Mallison. He chose to regard our commitment as open, and without consulting us until today, has obligated himself to pay 3050 green dollars to the ballet company, which is arriving in Berlin tomorrow, and whoss business manager expects to be paid immediately on arrival. Both Hallison, and indirectly Falster, have appealed to us to take him off the hook. Wo have informed him that such deals are contrary to FJCAFE policy, and anyway our original reason for considering such assistance is no longer operative. But because he and his shop are extremely useful to us in a variety of ways, we have told his we might perform the service of exchanging his marks on the open market, citing a six-to-ons rate as probably the best obtainable.

4. Rogardless of what Wallison has been told, we do not wish to involve this mission in local open market transactions. We are, therefore, exchanging from our funds bere 3050 green dollars for 18,300 Deutsche marks from Hallison. He will, of course, obtain a mark receipt fro. the ballet company's business manager in order to keep his books straight, and no paper outside FJCAFE files referring to this matter will oxist. We believe this operation secure and not disadvantageous to FJCAFE froa either a financial or influence standpoint.

MEMORANDUM FOR: ADPC

VIA: EE

SUBJECT: Unalassified IIC report on Congress of Cultural Freedom

REFERENCE: APO memorandum of 22 August, same subject

1. In regard to the recommendations contained in paragraph 6 of reference memorandum, an inquiry was sent to the Chief of the German Mission to determine the author of subject report and the circumstances surrounding its preparation. On 6 September the German Mission Chief replied as follows:

a. Subject report was one of three reported by Mr. Kenneth Downs, Mr. Delvin Leaky, and Mr. Half Ion Sehmitt, the latter being Deputy Chief of the Editorial Projection Branch, IWD. Subject report, sent to State Department, is verbatim as prepared by Mr. Von Eckart.

b. Mr. Von Eckart was present throughout the Congress and required no assistance or guidance in preparation of this report. It is considered unlikely that he had in mind promoting the interests of Mr. Leaky, with whom he had a sharp disagreement concerning press relations. Mr. Von Eckart originally went to the Congress expecting to handle the press but was abruptly cut off by Leaky to make way for another individual.

c. The document was not classified by HWD because it was considered to contain nothing of a classified nature; there was no internal HWD distribution of it outside of Dr. Stone's Public Affairs Division.

d. The original report bears a notation by Mr. William J. Evans, Chief of ISD, to the effect that he considered it "relatively objective". The Chief of our German Mission himself considers the report a fair summary of IICCO's quite enthusiastic reaction to the Congress as a whole.

e. It is known to the Chief of the German Mission that Leaky is not aware of the existence of subject report.

2. This report was handled in a quite routine manner upon receipt by the State Department here, getting neither highly limited nor highly wide-spread distribution. In addition to the Office of German Affairs, it was also sent to United Nations Affairs, Office of Libraries and Institutions, Mr. Barrett's division, and the division concerned with international organizations and conferences. So far as Mr. Bruce Buttles, who has been most discreet and helpful to us throughout the Congress matter, has been able to find out the report eventual no particular stir one way or the other.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 197

3. There have been no recent incidents involving Mr. Lasky, and it appears at this point that control of him is well in hand.

4. Mr. Lasky’s own report of the downscene is written in narrative rather than editorial style. It mentions primarily the financial aspects of the downpress but does not go completely overboard and makes no mention whatever of Lasky’s own part in it. It does not appear at all to be an ex-spiking document but simply one which was written in a flash of enthusiasm.

5. EE-3 is retaining subject report in the Ploquick file.

FROM: HICOG Frankfurt 260, July 26, 1950 1 Enclosure

REF: Dept Cable Srl No. 1509, 13 Sep 49, to USPOLAD Frankfurt

SUBJECT: PERIPHERAL - ACTIVITIES IN GERMANY OF BORIS IVANOVICH NIKOLAEVSKI.

Enclosed is a memorandum describing the activities of Boris Ivanovich Nikolaevski, head of the socialist League of New York, who has been in Germany for the past six weeks. It will be noted that Mr. Nikolaevski has been endeavoring to establish a bloc of left and center groups within the Russian emigration and that he is hopeful of obtaining the support of the executive committee set up by the recent Congress for Cultural Freedom in Berlin for a congress to be held in Paris attended by representatives of so-called "democratic" groups within the Russian emigration and by democratic figures from Western Europe and the United States.

It is recommended that the Department give serious consideration to the position which it should take with respect to Nikolaevski's proposal. If plans are proceeding to create a unified front within the Russian emigration which would receive American support in accordance with the recommendations set forth in the Halley report, it would appear inadvisable at this stage to give any official encouragement to a congress of Russian groups which would not be fully representative and would therefore tend to emphasize divergent trends within the emigration rather than minimizing differences and endeavoring to enlist broad support within the emigration for a program of anti-Communist activity.

Enclosure to HICOO Frankfurt
Despatch 2.3, July 26, 1950

## ACTIVITIES IN GERMANY OF BORIS IVANOVICH NIKOLAEVSKI

Boris Ivanovich Nikolaevski, the well-known Russian historian and Journalist and head of the New York socialist League, has been in Germany for the past six weeks attempting to line up support for a bloo of Russian groups of the left and conter and to promote a congress of "demcoratio" elements within the emigration which hồ hopes to convene in Paris in the fall under the sponsorship of the executive committee created at the recent Perlin Congress for Cultural Freedom.

Nikolaevski is a man of great energy and of very considerable stature among the Russian refugees in Germany. By virtue of his long-standing record as a social democrat he has axoullent contacts with Geman social-democratic and trade union dralos and has been parsonally acquainted with many of the present leaders of these organizations since his residence in Berlin in the early 308. He also enjoys wide confidence among Russian refugees by virtue of the fact that he was the first old Russian emigre of any stature to come to Germany after the war in an effort to give encouragement and assistance to members of the new Russian emigration.

Nikolaevaki has divided his time between Munich, Berlia and Frankfurt and has talked with a constant stream of visitors.

He has aise made numerous side trips to seek out refugees in whom he is interested. His principal objective has been to unite as many of the progressive or, as he cells them, "democratie" Russian groups as possible in an organization which will concentrate on the struggle against Communism. He has susoeaded in establishing glose personal relations with Boris Aleksandrovich Yakovlev head of SHONR (Fighting Unica for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia), and has also interosted SVOD, the military twin of SBONR, and the Solidariste.. (NTS) in his plan. As far as I have been able to discover, however, no agreement has been reached between these groups for the formation of a united organization, and NTS, following its oustomary practice, has indicated a willingness to cooperate but has not committed itself beyond that point.

Nikolaevski anticipates some opposition to his project from the left wing of the New York League by virtue of the Vlasovite antecedents of these organizations, but feels that he can eventually gain the support of his own organization. It is presumed that, final negotiations for the establishment of the hew orgrization will take place only after Nikolaevski returns to New York and gains League endorsement of his activities in Germany.

After the Berlin Congress for Cultural Freedom, in which Nikolaevski played a prominent and enthusiastic role, he conceived a new project namely the convocation of a conferanco in Paris under the sponsorship of the permanent executive committee orcated at the Berlin Congress, The Paris congress would be attended by "democratic" Russian emigres, both old and new, as well as by "democratic" leaders and intellectuais from Western Europe and the United States, including a number who attended the Berlin conference. The principal purpose of the Paris congress would be propagandistic; it would, in Nikolaevski's words, constitute a demonstration of the solidarity of anti-Communist sentiment among the Russian emigration and the democratic forces of the Western world.

Nikolaovski is a convinced and doctrinaire socialist and is firmly opposed to cooperation with or apparently even exposure to those groups within the enigration which are not ideologically sympathetic to him. His particular antipathy i8 dirested toward the Supreme Monarchist Council (VMS) and its president, Yuri Meyer, who, he claims, is manipulated by the staister behind-the-scenes figure of Colonel Baranovaki. He ean pred use no evidence beyond rumor to support his allegations regarding the role of Colonel Baranovaki who himself has person ally denied to me in the most emphatic terms that he plays any political pole whatsoever. It is a striking ceincidonce that Colonel Neryanin, the head of SVOD, one of the organizations which Nikolaevaki includes in his proposed union, is one of the principal assistants in the intelligence network of Colonel Barabovaki, who exprusses the highest regard for him.

I suggested to Nikolaevaki, and discussed with him as considerable length, the Gesirability of broadening the proposed. Paris congress to include representatives of all the principal groups represented in the emigration. I pointed out that the propaganda value of a congress in which the principal elements in the emigration were represented would be substantially greater than that of a meeting with caly fragmentary representa- tion; that a meeting from which certain influential groups were exoluded might result in a rival congress which would merely underline the diversive trends within the emigration and tend to crystallize them; that a congress meeting under the banner of demooraoy should be prepared to permit a demcoratie expression of opirion; and that participation in a meating of this kind with rival groups would in no sense constitute endorsement or approval of their programs. To these arguments Nikolaevski tumed a deaf ear. He stands fimly on the position that the social democrats, whom he consistentiy refers to as "democrats," cannot afford to compromise themselves or endanger their standing with the Russian people by the slightest evidence of cooperation with the right wing.

Nikolaevski is extremely anxious to sain the blessing of the United States Government for hie Faris venture. I told him frankly that while I was in no position to express an official opinion and could not venture a class as to Washington's' reaction, it seemed unlikely to me that the Amerion Government could afford to take sides in the internal political struggle within the Russian emigration, and that until the emiere groups succeeded in reconciling their own differences and were prepared to concentrate their efforts against the Soviet regime rather than against each other, the American Government would hardly be in a position to associate itself in any way with them. Nikolaevaki replied that the anti-Cسعةndst struggle itself was an inadequate program and that something positive must be offered to the Russian people, I agreed, ig this position but suggested that a united pregran on which enigration could agree would probably have much greater innast than a variety of programs offered by competing groups, Nikolaevski, however, stuck to his ideological guns.

Hikolaevaki was considerably perturbed by news he received Just before his departure from Frankfers to the effect that Yakovlev had been approached by Colonel Kroaladi, who is nominated in the Kelley memorandum as the leader of the united front organization, to lend the support of SBONR to an emigre congress to be convened in Munich. Yakovlev bad gained the Impression that this project bad American support, although Kromiadi bad apparently made no explicit statement to this effect. He had based his arguments on the broad, concept of united ewigre effort against the Soviet regime and had indicated that it would be a congress of Russian patriots rather than of representatives of emigre organizations. This ameal had obviously made a considerable impression on Yakovlev, ww 18 much less ideologically minded than Nikolaevski and much more inclined to ally himself with any activity which he feels can effectively bring pressure against the Sovieta. Nikolaevski, while expressing high personal regard for Colonel Kromiadi, inmediately attributed this project to the machinations of Meyer and Baranovski and adopted a completely negative attitude toward it. I told him that I had had ne previous knowledge of the project and that I felt reasonably sure that it did not enjoy American support.

Nikolaevski plans to proceed to France and attend the first meeting of the executive committee established at the Berlin Congress in an effort to interest then in his project for a congress of Russian emigres.

## COMMENT

If Nikolaevski in his intransigent position is supported by his organization, which I assume will be the case, it will present a serious obstacle to any plans for uniting the forces of the Russian emigration in the anti-Communist struggle. Nikolaevski's ideological principles are so firmly enrooted that it appears unlikely that anything will shake them or that he can be persuaded to cooperate with groups whose political views differ markedly from his own. Nikolaevski's name and pen carry great influence among Russian emigres and it is most desirable that they be utilized to the utmost. It would be neither realistic nor practical, however, to accept Nikolaevski's position and thereby eliminate other influential groups within the emigration. One solution for this dilemma might be to ignore the extremist groups, right and left, which refuse to participate in the common effort and concentrate primarily on the new emigration who are more flexible in their political ideas and whose under- standing of the Soviet regime is more resent and more profound. The extremists will then be faced with the alternative of carrying on alone or of making peace with their conscience and joining the common cause.

The follwing views of LIOUV on the Berlin Congress have been reported as of interest to the sponsors of the Congress.

1. The Ferlin Congress is regarded in France as a movement exclusively of the axtreme left, of former Communists and present non-Stalinite Larxists. Utservers regard with disfarer the fact that the Congress was extremely mild in is cotack against the porict regis. They point out that:

(a) The Soviet regime as such is not mentioned in a single resolution, which linised themselves to the condemning "totelitarian regives."

(b) The issuance of an anti-Franco resolation in the absence of an anti-Stalin resolution is significant,

(с) те геfusal to recognize the representatives of the Russian NTS group present at the Congress as listed delegates" confims the extreme leftist nature of the Congress.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION

SUBJECT: Congress for Cultural Freedom

18 August 1950

1. On 15 August, I discussed the Berlin Cultural Congress with Kenneth H. Earbley, with particular emphasis on the problem of bringing the continuing Congress organization under control and, at the same time, expanding it into an effective anti-communist weapon.

2. I expressed to Hambley our concern over the manner in which Charles A. Skeggs had conducted himself during the Congress, and Hambley replied that he had been equally concerned. He said, however, that while Skeggs activities had caused an unfavorable reaction on the part of a number of the delegates, that reaction had been more directed against Skeggs personally than against him as a representative of the government. Hambley agreed with my suggestion that two bits of silver lining could be found in the Skeggs cloud, namely that he had taken most of the opposition heat himself, thus sparing some of our other people, and that he had conducted himself like anything but the "Polizeispitzel" the communist press of Germany made him out to be. In fact, said Hambley, Skeggs general attitude was such as to cause some of the delegates to disremember that Skeggs was attached to the government in any fashion or presumably subject to any discipline at all.

3. Hambley said that most of the delegates with whom he had talked were perfectly willing to accept the explanation that the Congress was smiled upon by the United States Government to the extent that some official funds were supplied for the physical staging of the meeting (as indeed they were) but that the rest of the money came from somewhat vague unofficial sources in the United States. Those who suspected something more, with the exception of the Trevor-Roper group, were generally happy that the United States was doing something of this kind and were in no mood to ask any embarrassing questions or raise any delicate points.

4. I asked Hambley what he thought his future role in the Congress should be. He replied that he was perfectly willing to undertake any activities we asked him to undertake but personally felt he should retire into the background as rapidly as possible.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

I told him that fooling coincided entirely with our own views and that we would expect him to contist himself in tint fashion. It was agreed that he should continue as a member of the Inter national Committee of Twenty-five but should take no active overt part in organizational or policy matters and would operate behind the scenes only when so directed.

5. I discussed with hin the problem raised by the presence of David Rousset and Ignazio Silone on the Executive Committee. Hambley agreed that neither of these individuals could be COD- sidered fully reliable but explained it had been impossible to exclude them from the Committee because of their prominence and the intereste which they represented. Ee said he ideed Rousset as a person who considered himself basically on the American side even though from time to time he had to make noises of a sort to satisfy his leftist constituents.. Es also described Rousset as a bit of a bluffer who could be handled by a combination of fires and tact, particularly so long as to continued to desire to be an American ally. Hambley described Silone as a more complex case- a vain, egocentric person of strong intellect but weak will and an inept politician who insisted on engaging in politics solely to satisfy his ego. Fambley said Silene probably would have been lost to the cause entirely had he not been given a prominent role including a position on the Executivo Committee but that, as it was, he appeared on the surface now to be a convert, albeit a dubious оnе. Hadley expressed belief, however, that Silone could be controlled if haudied expertly and that, if worst came to worst, he could be separated from the Committee without dis- astrous effect. Hambley said that in his opinion Arthur Koestler and Cario Schmid were altogether reliable politically and could be depended upon to counterbalance Silone and Roussot even though it would be unwise to take then fully into confidence as to the nature of the Congress' backing. Irving Brown, of course, is considered completely reliable.

6. Inasmuch as the Executive Committee is a creature of the Committee of Twenty-five and draws its membership from that Committee, the latter constitutes the real point of control in the Congress organization. The Committee of Twenty-five, as it stands, is reliable on balance. If necessary, it could be weighted more heavily in our favor by exercise of the privilege of co-opting additional members on whom we could depend, Heabley said. Ee suggested that it might be well to establish a principle either of rotating members of the Executive Committee or of con ducting regular elections of the parent Committee of Twenty-five. probably preferably the latter. This mechanism would provide means whereby obstreperous Executive Committee members might be sidetracked. Eumbley agreed that this might prove a workable scheme.

MEMORANDUM FOR LR. PRECKIMRIDGE

SUBJECT: Berlin Concress for Cultural Freedom; activities of Kelvin Lasky.

REFERENCE: Keno fr EE-3/Glaser to CES dtd 4 Aur 50 w/atts (TSL2928).

1. I continue to be very disturbed about the manner in which this entire matter has been conducted, including the non-observance of my orijinal memorandum of 7 April 1950, in which I approved this project, subject to the condition that Lasky would not be permitted to figure publicly in this operation. The memorandum of Er. Glaser and the con- versations mich I have had with Lessrs. Lindsay and Eaker have done very little to relieve my apprehension on the score that no effective action to exclude Lasky from continuing te play a biatantly conspicuous role either has or will be taken by us.

2. I submit that paragraph six of the reference memorandum, in both tone and content, is entirely unsatisfactory for the following reasons:

a. It fails to reveal any appropriate acknowledgment or comprehension of the damage mich has resulted from Er. Lasky's conduct. This was a major blunder, has been branded as such by our best friends in the State Department, has teen revealed as such by the publicity which is analyzed in the reference петоган- duri itself and must be acknowledged by the responsible members. of our staff both there and in Germany.

b. It betrays an unfortunate tendency, apparently more deeprooted than I had suspected, to succumb to the temptation of convenience (doing things the easy way) and irrespective of security and other technical considerations of the utmost importance.

3. I have stated to Mr. Lindsay orally and I want to make myself completely clear on this point that unless means can be found to sani- tize this operation by the removal of Lasky, Surnham and other persons of known or traceable official significance from overt roles in the proposed continuing organization, then I am unwilling to have CPC continue

continue its backing. I repeat my request that this be delivered to the field as an instruction and that it be so regarded and acted upon within this headquarters. I do not wish to create the impression that I am in any way opposed to the continuation of the operation, provided it can be sanitized and handled with a greater degree of sophistication and technical expert ease than has characterized our performance up to date. However, I do not wish to be associated with any repetition of what we have seen thus far.

P.S. Since dictating the foregoing, I have just learned from General Magruder that he showed our report on this Congress to Secretary Johnson, together with his own very complimentary appraisal of the operation. Secretary Johnson was so favorably impressed with this report and General Magruder's comment that he took the papers over and showed them to the President, who expressed himself as being very well pleased. I can only hope that the very rough edges which have recently appeared are not brought too sharply to the attention of these lofty officials. In any case this development underscores in red everything which I have said about the necessity for tidying up this operation and eliminating all of the "Irish pennants".

LOGICRANDE FOR: 18. RAZER

SUBJECT : PD.UICK; Conference with Lir. Burnham

1. In the first of a series of talks with I'r. Burnham, following his reward from Burope, a broad coverage of the Cultural Congress was splored as well as post-Congres plans and proceedings.

2. I went into very little detail with hir. Burnkan as to the eventual setup of the Congress as a permanent institution except to suggest that it had very broad and far-reaching implications and would be carefully studied and pursued within the next few weeks. Fr. Burnham, however, emressed his point of view (which is to be further explored in other reetings this week) as follows:

a. The continuation of the Congress as a going concern of intended permanence is now a fact. (We know that there is an executive comittee, an operating committee and that the institution of a Paris Office has been authorized.) Overtly, a permanent Congress for Cultural Freedom can vastly improve the clinate of opinion throughout Eurore, at least, to the extent that it may considerably counter Soviet propaganda and may very well affect large groups of people far beyond the point of reutrality, per-. haps to resistance. Also overtly, the Congress can utilize its participants in various forms of writing, speaking, and political: actica. Covertly, the Coreress can perform a number of useful functions, including maintenance of contect with various resistance ours, forwarding money to such groups, spreading of clandestine propaganda and other purposes. No creat pretentions are necessary in connection with the establishment of the Congress as a permanent institution, though a small office in Paris and another in Berlin are indicated. The sponsorship of a French Intellectual Pericdicel seems to be one of the most pressing and one of the best ideas, and áron is enthusiastic about it and is willing to work for such a magazine as editor. Other members of the Congress, Takevlew, for instance, are willing to work on Congress publications and both Koestler and Duber-Neunan are very anrions to take part in the literary and political activities. Bonav is a very useful man, apparently entirely reliable and a food writer and organizer; he knows languages and knows Dropear politics.

b. The impact of the Congress on Derin was terrific and Reuter's part magnificent. The whole city was very eager and receptive and paid an extraordinary amount of attention to all of the Congress activities. The book display at the Congress itself was only fairly effective, but was extremely telling in the book stores throughout Western sectors, which made special displays of the books and photographs of the authors. Broadcasting by redio Rias seems to have been more or less nominal, although RIAS cut tapes of all of the Congress speeches, but the Voice of America team did a first-class and absolutely outstanding job. The Congress was given big coverage by VOA in several languages. In addition to the records of European publicity that are on hand, a considerable additional amount was produced. For instance, there was daily broadcasting of a French radio station and sporadic broadcasting coverage by other stitions. There was a large amount of publicity in France and England and a substantial amount in Italy, Sweden and other countries. Special articles are still appearing in the European press and periodicals. The influence of the Congress on a number of important literary and-political leaders appears to be very significant. This was especially true in the case of Frenay and Silone, both of whom under-went an apparent conversion due to the operations of the Congress. On the other hand, the composition of the Congress was unbalanced nationally and also because it was too leftist, too radical.

c. The irritation caused by the Trevor-Roper article in the Manchester Guardian was a reflection of the attitude of three members of the British delegation, Trevor-Roper, Ayer, and Peter de Lendelssohn. Actually, Lendelssohn (an old buddy of Lasky's) was the cause of the trouble. He is a second-rate writer, a neurotic, frustrated intellectual, who had a chip on his shoulder and unquestionably inspired Trevor-Roper and Ayer with his spirit of antagonism. Another complication was the fact that Ayer and Koestler have been intellectual rivals and bitterly dislike each other. Ayer was infuriated by Koestler's prominence and communicated this antagonism to Trevor-Roper. The letter is an excessively conceited man (Burnham added at this point that almost all intellectuals are excessively conceited) and was openly annoyed because he did not figure in the proceedings with sufficient prominence. ("Incidentally," says Burnham, "Trevor-Roper's description of Koestler as a 'rootless European' follows Pravda, which uses that term as a general description for Jews.") The annoyance felt by Trevor-Roper and Ayer at their relegation to minor roles in comparison to Koestler found its outlet in articles which both of

these men have written, (Note: We have only seen the one by Trevor-Roper.) and the situation was complicated by the desire of Trevor-Roper to maintain a high and academic objectivity in relation to world affairs, whereas the delegates to the Congrass insisted on making it a realistic denunciation of the Communist strangle-hold on culture and intellectual freedom. Koestler epitomizes the lofty philosophical viewpoint by saying, "Do you want partiel liberty or total slavery?" Lasky has written a reply, over his naze, to Trevor-Koper.

d. Melvin Lasky is cranted the qualities of ability, courage, hard work and political intuition but, he is, at the same time, the most vain and egocentric individual imaginable. In addition to which, he is an intellectual snov, and a publicity hound. Also, he definitely is not reliable, cannot be counted upon to do things that he should do unless they work in with his own ideas. He has the Russian Menshetic point of view which is simply that of useless intrique for the sake of intrigue. His intellectual snobbery was indiceted in his process of meetin; delegates. If they were very important, he went to meet them with his personal car and driver--along with newspaper photographers. If they were reasonably important, a private car res sent for them. If they were ordinary delegates, they was given transportation on a bus. At least one dole-Eate was contacted by Burnham and arrangements were made with Lasky to invite him, but no invitation was sent. In the case of Max Vergin, Lasky succeeded in mümiliating him and in the case of Yakevlow, Lasky ut first refused to print his name on the program at all. Lasky has done a wonderful job with Der Monet and there is no qü39-tion as to his netural ability and capacity for hard work but it is difficult to see how he can be used in any outstanding position in connection with a continuation of the Congress unless it is in an advisory capacity, possibly in charge of the Serlin office and with a strong hand to subdue his self-advertising proclivities.

3. The stove represents Burnham's general views, in some cases expressed spontanecus17, in others dram out by questions, and it is new proposed to have a further meeting and ask him to talk about the development potentialities and techniques.

SUBJECT: FDQUICK - Existing Organization

1. Pursuant to your oral request of this morning, there are set forth below the elements of subject organization. As you are avare subject is in a fluid stage but, as of 7 July 1950, the following steps had been taken (except that the action described under "a" was taken at the end of the month of July):

a. A small Paris office was opened with M. Louis Gibarti as Secretary, on trial for a two-month period.

b. Letters had been sent out to the honorary Chairmen requesting them to continue to serve in that capacity. These chairmen are: Croce, Dowey, Maritain, Jaspers, and Russell. This action was taken by the Congress in session.

c. An Executive Committee of five had been nominated. This committee consists of Ignazio Silone, David Rousset, Arthur Koestler, Irving Brown and Carlo Schmid. This action was likewise taken by the Congress in session.

d. Also at the Berlin session of the Congress an Inter- national Committee of twenty-five was nominated. All but the last five of these were also confirmed. The last five had not been confirmed as of 7 July 1950. The names of these twenty-five individuals follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR: MR. R. AJEER

SUBJECT : FD JICK; Conference with Mr. Burnham

1. In the first of a series of talks with Mr. Burnham, follow- ing his return from Europe, a broad coverage of the Cultural Congress was explored as well as post-Congress plans and proceedings.

2. I went into very little detail with Mr. Burnham as to the eventual setup of the Congress as a permanent institution except to suggest that it had very broad and far-reaching implications and would be carefully studied and pursued within the next few weeks. Mr. Burnham, however, expressed his point of view (which is to be further ex- plored in other meetings this week) as follows:

a. The continuation of the Congress as a going concern of intended permanence is now a fact. (We know that there is an executive committee, an operating committee and that the instit- ution of a Paris Office has been authorized.) Overtly, a per- manent Congress for Cultural Freedom can vastly improve the climate of opinion throughout Europe, at least, to the extent that it may considerably counter Soviet propaganda and may very well affect large groups of people far beyond the point of neutrality, per- haps to resistance. Also overtly, the Congress can utilize its participants in various forms of writing, speaking, and political action. Covertly, the Congress can perform a number of useful functions, including maintenance of contact with various resis- tance groups, forwarding money to such groups, spreading clandestine propaganda and other purposes. No great pretentions are necessary in connection with the establishment of the Congress as a permanent institution, though a small office in Paris and another in Berlin are indicated. The sponsorship of a French Intellectual Periodical seems to be one of the most pressing and one of the best ideas, and Aron is enthusiastic about it and is willing to work for such a magazine as editor. Other members of the Congress, Yakovlev, for instance, are willing to work on Con- gress publications and both Koestler and Buber-Neumann are very anxious to take part in the literary and political activities. Bondy is a very useful man, apparently entirely reliable and a good writer and organizer; he knows languages and knows European politics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 218

b. The impact of the Congress on Berlin was terrific and Reuter's part magnificent. The whole city was very eager and receptive and paid an extraordinary amount of attention to all of the Congress activities. The book display at the Congress itself was only fairly effective, but was extremely telling in the book stores throughout western sectors, which made special displays of the books and photographs of the authors. Broadcasting by radio RIAS seems to have been more or less nominal, although RLS cut tapes of all of the Congress speeches, but the Voice of America team did a first-class and absolutely outstanding job. The Congress was given big coverage by VOA in several languages. In addition to the records of European publicity that are on hand, a considerable additional amount was produced. For instance, there was daily broadcasting of a French radio station and sporadic broadcasting coverage by other stations. There was a large amount of publicity in France and England and a substantial amount in Italy, Sweden and other countries. Special articles are still appearing in the European press and periodicals. The influence of the Congress on a number of important literary and political leaders appears to be very significant. This was especially true in the case of Frenay and Silone, both of whom underwent an apparent conversion due to the operations of the Congress. On the other hand, the composition of the Congress was unbalanced nationally and also because it was too leftist, too radical.

c. The irritation caused by the Trevor-Roper article in the Manchester Guardian was a reflection of the attitude of three members of the British delegation, Trevor-Roper, Ayer, and Petit de Mendelssohn. Actually, Mendelssohn (an old buddy of Lasky's) was the cause of the trouble. He is a second-rate writer, a neurotic, frustrated intellectual, who had a chip on his shoulder and unquestionably inspired Trevor-Roper and Ayer with his spirit of antagonism. Another complication was the fact that Ayer and Koestler have been intellectual rivals and bitterly dislike each other. Ayer was infuriated by Koestler's prominence and communicated this antagonism to Trevor-Roper. The latter is an excessively conceited man (Burnham added at this point that almost all intellectuals are excessively conceited) and was openly annoyed because he did not figure in the proceedings with sufficient prominence. ("Incidentally," says Burnham, "Trevor-Roper's description of Koestler as a 'rootless European' follows Pravda, which uses that term as a general description for Jews.") The annoyance felt by Trevor-Roper and Ayer at their relegation to minor roles in comparison to Koestler found its outlet in articles which both of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 219

SEGRET

these men have written, (Note: We have only seen the one by Trevor-Roper.) and the situation was complicated by the desire of Trevor-Roper to maintain a high and academic objectivity in relation to world affairs, whereas the delegates to the Congress insisted on making it a realistic enunciation of the Communist strangle-hold on culture and intellectual freedom. Koestler epitomizes the lofty philosophical viewpoint by saying, "Do you want partial liberty or total slavery?" Lasky has written a reply, over his name, to Trevor-Roper.

d. Melvin Lasky is granted the qualities of ability, courage, hard work and political intuition but he is, at the same time, the most vain and egocentric individual imaginable. In addition to which, he is an intellectual snob and a publicity hound. Also, he definitely is not reliable, cannot be counted upon to do things that he should do unless they work in with his own ideas. He has the Russian Menshevik point of view which is simply that of useless intrigue for the sake of intrigue. His intellectual snobbery was indicated in his process of meeting delegates. If they were very important, he want to meet them with his personal car and driver-along with newspaper photographers. If they were reasonably import-ant, a private car was sent for them. If they were ordinary dele-gates, they were given transportation on a bus. At least one delegate was contacted by Burnham and arrangements were made with Lasky to invite him but no invitation was sent. In the case of Max Yargin, Lasky succeeded in humiliating him and in the case of Yakovlev. Lasky at first refused to print his name on the program at all. Lasky has done a wonderful job with Dor. Monet and there is no question as to his natural ability and capacity for hard work but it is difficult to see how he can be used in any outstanding position in connection with a continuation of the Congress unless it is in an advisory capacity, possibly in charge of the Berlin office and with a strong hand to subdue his self-advertising proclivities.

3. The above represents Burnham's general views, in some cases expressed spontaneously, in others drawn out by questions, and it is now proposed to have a further meeting and ask him to talk about the development potentialities and techniques.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CASE

TERCUGH: MR. SCHREYER, EE 3

SUBJECT: Activities of Mr. Melvin Lasky in connection with Congress for Cultural Freedom (Project PDQUICK)

1. This is in response to your request that we examine our files and submit a statement concerning the undue prominence given to Mr. Melvin Lasky in connection with the Cultural Congress.

2. Lasky was publicly identified, early in the preparations for the Congress, as the spark plug and leading light. This unsatisfactory position vas anticipated by Mr. Wiener, who, in his approval of Project PDQUICK, cautioned against emphasis on Lasky's participation. (Attachment A).

3. From the beginning, the home office was cognizant of the danger of a spotlight being thrown on any overt C. S. employee, and, in addition to previous warnings, on 7 April cabled specific instructions for the retirement of Lasky to the background. This and other admonitions, from the home office and the OPC German Mission chief; will be found at attachment B.

4. However, a review of the publicity which the Congress received shows an unfortunate amount of concentration on Lasky. In Berlin, for instance, where the Congress received its greatest publicity output, out of 180 newspaper clippings which are available, approximately 15 specifically featured Lasky, some of them photographically. Of the U. S. and British press clippings which were available, several featured Lasky prominently. In a feature article in the *New Leader*, the subject of which was the Cultural Congress, Lasky was referred to as the initiator of the Congress and he was featured in at least two of the formal press releases which were given out in Berlin. Of the 73 photographs which covered the Congress and which were released for press and historical purposes, Lasky is prominently featured in 6. (a large amount of this publicity material, including photographs, press cuttings and press releases, is available in our files.) While Lasky's part as General Secretary was over-emphasized in a number of newspapers and periodicals, the most danaging article appeared as a review of the Congresa in the *Manchester Guardian*, written by the prominent historian, Mr. H. R. Trevor-Roper in which Lasky was described as connected with American Information Services and the organizer of the Congress. The statement was unfortunate because this was the only critical article of the Congress known to have appeared in the Western press. It passing, it zight be mentioned that the *Lordon Economist* also picked up Lasky's appointment as General Secretary, as suggesting U. S. sponsorship. Its review,

# SECRET

however, was laudatory and pointed up the sincerity and usefulness of the gathering. The holding of the Congress in Berlin was described as "a gesture of defiance"; the meeting was called an event of considerable significance" (strong words for the *London Economist*) and it was referred to as marking, or at least reflecting "a turning point of the western counter-attack in the cold war." "Korea," said the *Economist*, "made the fortune of the Congress and crystallized the real issue before the delegates." Trevor-Roper, in a letter to the *Economist*, commenting on its article, was much more temperate than in his article in the *Guardian*. For example, in the *Economist* he declared, "We were almost all united against Communism from the start."

5.  At this point, it should be specified that from the time the Congress was first discussed, it was recognized that the Communist press would indict it as a fascist, war mongering, propaganda group operating under the intelligence auspices of the U. S. and that this accusation would be broadcast by the Communist machine (as it was) whether or not, in fact the Congress had been under any external controls. It was also recognized that the General Secretary of the Congress would inevitably receive a certain amount of attention from the press. It seems to be clear, however, that this amount of attention was unnecessarily large.

6.  Notwithstanding the undue personal publicity achieved by Mr. Lasky, it is significant that:

a. He played a most important role in the conception, development, organization and control of the Congress. Without his active interest and support the launching of the Congress would have been most difficult..

b. The Congress was a highly successful operation. In its stand against intellectual neutrality in the struggle against Communism, its *Letter to the East*, its final "Manifesto," and its deliberations and intellectual discussions, the Congress has proven its propaganda value which will be extended and expanded to a greater degree in the future.

MEMORANDUM FOR MESSRS. FRANK
LINDSAY
OFFIE

SUBJECT: Project FIXQUICK

1. With reference to my conversation with Mr. Baker concerning the project outline covering the subject project, I have approved this project subject to the following condition. It makes no sense to me that we should state in paragraph 6 under the heading of security that all practicable measures will be taken to disguise the official U. S. interest, financial and otherwise; and at the same time to provide that one of the two active sponsors will be Mr. Melvin J. Lasky, editor of the overt HICOG monthly magazine "Der Monat." I understand that Mr. Lasky is needed as one of the principal organizers and operatives but I think it quite unnecessary for his name to be flourished about as a sponsor. After all, he is officially employed by HICOG--he is, therefore, an acknowledged member of the U. S. apparatus in Germany. Why then should his name be used? Reuter is an excellent sponsor and surely it will be possible to find one or more others--non-American or at least non-official American--to serve as sponsors.

2. Generally in the same connection I assume that our consultant, Mr. Burnham, will operate in the wings and that his name will not be too prominently displayed. As the result of his recent book and the furer of communist commentary, he is a "sitting duck" for hostile propagania in my opinion. I am entirely in favor of his participating extensively in the arrangements, but the more his participation can be in the form of "off-stage shispers" the better.

T. S.

The decision on this is not up to me. I will appreciate opportunity to discuss it with you.

My point of view is that ALL of this current PIQUICK stuff is premature and a case of a lot of hungry actors smelling easy money and wanting to get into the act and get the show on the road.

We have no budget for PDQUICK for this period - and literally are living on borrowed funds. We can't make up a budget because we have no accounting from the field, do not know where we stand.

Here are some other questions in my mind:

What wore the publicity accomplishments of the relatively expensive NY office?

What happened to the Berlin news coverage by US correspondents?

What happened to the bright and sanguinary forecasts of tremendous amounts of publicity, special magazine articles, radio broadcasts, etc. which were to emanate from the attendance at the Congress of Messrs. Montgomery and Conant a little matter which cost the US about two thousand pieces of lettuce ? (It seems clear that their attendance was absolutely worthless otherwise.)

What happened to their efforts to obtain delegates from the Middle East?

Why did Lasky proceed with a dozen last minute invitations to innocuous persons (these were supposed to be 'a few' and to extremely important people) including several wives.

A cablegram was sent urging that a press conference be arranged for Franz Mehring? Did it take place?.

There were no photographs of the book displays. This book display was an expensive item. Did it take place?

Now with all these questions in my mind, adding up to a realisation that if the Congress was a success, it was only a. success as far as it went, and it has a long way to go to completely justify itself - the next steps NOT being spending a lot of dough for the support of deserving intellectuals who have no other source of thoore, but in getting a distribution of a million pieces of literature, and other publicity, in Satellite areas - I would hesitate (which is a euphemism for blankly object) to blandly appropriating an extra ten thousand bucks to support an innocuous group of Russian exiles who want to air their grievances, NOT under our control.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CXX 3

SUBJECT: 229-CTDU, Special Report on PIQUICK

Ulmer and Iroller have discussed the attached paper and are agreed as follows:

a. We think that in the preparation of the paper, Joselson was acting as a reporter rather than fundamentally expressing his own ideas.

b. In our opinion, the whole scheme, as described in the special report, is much too grandioso, ambitious and cumbersome.

c. We agree that the Congress should continue in existence but we do not think that it has to have any legal establishment.

d. We see the functioning of a continuing organisation as providing the basis for future Congress meetings, providing members with a focus of interest, providing a logical source of information, propaganda, publications, and publicity, and as a cover for certain Fs operations.

e. We think the organisation of the Congress could follow the outline in paragraph 4 of the Reference down to, and including, the General Secretary, with the addition of an Executive Assistant, a stenographer, and a typist, and elimination of the rest of the suggested personnel.

f. We think it advisable that the Congress have one office, possibly, though not necessarily, in Paris, and that its other "offices" (which in actuality need be little more than letter drops) would require no personnel and no administrative machinery except arrangements for the forwarding of mail. Any other sporadic use to be made of such offices, such as localized


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 226

- 2 -

press releases, for instance, could be accomplished through a resident center of either the Executive Committee or the International Committee.

g. We think that it need not cost more than $23,000 for the next year to maintain the Congress organization, pay for administration, traveling expenses, including the salaries of personnel, which would assume a General Secretary who would be an agent. (This latter concept may not be absolutely necessary; but if not, then provision should be made for OFC contact some other way.) In addition to the $25,000, specified above, there should be an allotment of $50,000 for the holding of the next Congress. Another $25,000 should be added for special purposes largely connected with publicity. The major part of the expenditures for the next year for collection, printing, and dissemination of Congress material and which could conceivably amount to as much as $250,000 as a top figure, would be provided, it is hoped, by PCA funds.

h. The activities mentioned in Part II of subject report could very well be handled under the setup outlined above with certain exceptions which seem to be too broad in scope to be justified at all.

# SPECIAL REPORT: Situation and Perspectives.

## I ORGANIZATION

1.  At the conclusion of the Berlin sessions of the CONGRESS FOR CULTURAL FREEDOM, the basis for continuing work was created by the appointment of several committees. Some confusion and uncertainty reigned at this period; these need to be clarified. The following is suggested:

    a. Honorary Chairman: Letters will go out this week to the five philosophers -- Croce, Dewey, Maritain, Jaspers, and Russell -- requesting them to honor the CONGRESS by continuing to serve with the permanent commission.

    b. Sponsors: A great many distinguished men in the field of art and science had given their support to the Berlin Congress, although they were unable to come. Their names would be most useful in the Congress' continuing activities. If, as seems only appropriate, the final International Committee of 25 should consist only of "active members", then some of the nominations originally included should be transferred by the working Executive Committee to this special list of Sponsors. These (before the Congress) included -- and permission here will also be requested -- Andre Gide, Ralph Bunche (important, for no Negro was nominated in Berlin), Carl Zuckmayer, Salvador de Madariaga...... among many others.

    c. International Committee of 25: At the Berlin sessions the following were nominated -- (1) Ignazio Silone; (2) David Rousset;
    (3) Arthur Koestler; (4) Carlo schmid; (5) Irving Brown; (6) Julian Amery; (7) Haakon Lie; (8) James Burnham; (9) Sidney Hook; (10) Nicolas Nabokow; (11) Eugen Kogon; (12) Theodor Plievier; (13) Herbert Read; (14) Denis de Rougemont; (15) Lionello Venturi; (16) Boris Nikolaevsky; (17) Karol Kurka;
    (18) Josef Czapski; (19) Margarete Buber-Neumann; (20) Andre Philip..... These were all present and are confirmed. The following were nominated and still have to be informed, and confirmed; (21) Richard Crossman; (22) Francois Mauriac; (23) Pablo Casals (for the "Sponsors"); (24) Thornton Wilder; (25) Oskar Pollak; and (26) Salvador de Madariaga ("Sponsor?").

    d. Executive Committee of 5: This consists of the first five named above -- Silone, Housset, Koestler, Brown, and Schmid (who has definitely accepted, and thus taken the place of Kogon).

2. It was decided to hold the first meeting of the CONGRESS Executive Committee during the first week in September in Paris. It will probably be desirable to hold several informal meetings before then in order to work out the outline and details of a functioning CONGRESS plan.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 228

3. Urgent problem facin; the CONGRESS by September is the woricing out of a legal or constitutional basis of the permanent CONGRESS organization. Who are *"mamborn"*? !low is the International Committee to be maintained; how are additions, substractions, changes in this and the Frocutive Committee to be made? who invites to the next Congress, and who votos"? number of proposals should be considered before a finel Momorandum is presented. This should be done in conjunction with the man who will probably be Ceneral- Secretary and/or Frecutive Director of the CONDRESS.

4. It is supposted that the original title be kept and made permanent - namely, CONGRESS FOR CULTURAL FRANDOL/KONGRESS FUER KULTURILE FRIFEIT/ CONGRESS POUR LA LIBERTE DE LA GALTURK. The use of the word *"CONGRESS"* in such connootion has its parallel both with the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations) in the UA, and with the Congress Party in india.

5. A rovisional plan for the organization of the CONGRESS should be worked out, less in the expectation that it will be immediately set up than in the hope that within the next six months it can be more and more realized. The following sketch is submitted:

CONGRESS FOR CULTUREL FREEDOM

II ACTIVITIES

1. Publications Project: the immediate editing of a volume on the founding Berlin CONGRESS. Most of the material is already available in three languages: French, English, and German. This will be completed in the next month by the transitional CONGRESS Bureau in Berlin. Herbert Luthin is assisting in putting out the special double number of "Der Monat" on the Congress, which may be a kind of "experimental model". Francois Bondy is returning to work out a table of contents and an editorial approach to the Congress volume.

2. Pamphlet Project: the immediate preparation and publication in many languages of a simple straight forward brochure (12-24) pages on "What is the Congress for Cultural Freedom?" It should be illustrated; should tell the story of the Berlin sessions; should print the Manifesto of Intellectual Liberty (and possibly a revised improved Message to the East); should outline a plan of Congress work to be followed and point to the future. This is essential for CONGRESS sympathizers, for the press, for the public in general. The Editorial Director (Bondy) can be assigned to prepare a draft for revision and approval in September.

3. Investigation Project: the first of a series of White Book reports on the situation of cultural freedom. Silone has recommended, and the CONGRESS has announced, a documented account of the writer, artist, and scientist in the countries behind the Iron Curtain (an account which the UNESCO, because of its governmental connections, cannot do). An immediate beginning should be made with the appointment of a Research Chief for this project, responsible for working out an editorial plan, contacting sources for information; this project chief should have the sociological and journalistic qualifications of men like Lowenthal and Bohnen (and Peter de Habelsohn).

4. Protest Project: the CONGRESS should, with the specific signatures of its leading supporters, keep in the forefront of public attention by taking up via the press, open meetings, debates, etc., cases of flagrant violations of the principles of the CONGRESS as stated in the Manifesto and other documents. The CONGRESS cannot, to be sure, become an international civil-liberties union, but it can speak out on special issues (purge of a University, liquidation of a scientist, arrest of a writer, etc.).

5. Break-away Project: the CONGRESS should by means both of information and agitation keep alive the difference between those who are choosing freedom and those who are willingly or unknowingly supporting totalitarianism and its deceptions. The dramatic defection of Prof. Alfred Weber during the Congress Berlin session from the Soviet-controlled Academy of Science is an example of what can be done; this specific German movement is gathering strength; there have been another half-dozen resignations, and the news in spreading in Eastern Germany. This has also involved the world-famous


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 230

Charito hospital in Eastern Berlin, almost 3/4 of the distinguished medical specialists are ready to break away, and we are now hoping to reach some constructive arrangement by which they can maintain themselves in West Berlin. This type of activity - ranging from welcoming prominent individuals from the East, to sheltering groups and institutions, and beginning with initial private contact - can transform the CONGRESS from a group of spokesmen for the libertarian ideal into "activists for freedom".

6. Radio-Broadcasting Project: Inaugurating a special series of radio programs to be prepared by the CONGRESS. Liaison should be established with RI, the Free Europe network, the French, Austrian, German and British stations, including the Voice of America. Plans have been started for the first series - namely, "Dialogues across the Curtain"; a dozen 'open-letters' - Koestler to Seghers and Froant, other to Rechner, Eisler, Lumos, Lysenko, Tarle, Ehrenburg, et. al. - personalized messages of five minutes (less in hateful opposition, more in open-hearted pity). This would be a practical follow-up to the CONGRESS message to the East". These could be published in various newspapers; later in small book-form.

7. Annual Prize-Award Project: the CONGRESS should award each year a number of CONGRESS prizes to various personalities for distinctive services and contributions to the cause of Cultural Freedom. This could be given on the basis of a new book, a career, or some special activities. Two types can be distinguished: the Nobel-Prize model, and the University Stipend. The latter could enable the recipient (an American, a Frenchman) to spend four weeks in Berlin, giving a series of 5 CONGRESS lectures at the Free University, later to be printed as a special CONGRESS volume. (This is equally true of an English recipient at Heidelberg, a German at the New School in N.Y.C., a Frenchman at the London School of Economics, etc.)

8. Publishing-House Project: This could be a modestly-conceived annex to the CONGRESS Berlin-Bureau, which would actually bring out the CONGRESS volumes (indicated above). It would also publish the pamphlets and brochures mentioned. It would consider the popular cultural-political library (the Birkenfeld proposal). It could be the house to which "Der Monat" would go, if and when this monthly becomes completely independent. It would gradually build up its own list of authors from among prominent CONGRESS writers (Koestler, et. al.). The Publishing-House could be started from the existing transitional CONGRESS bureau now functioning in Berlin; the Bureau-Director, or the Executive Assistant, could be charged with the responsibilities of a normal international Publisher in Germany (incorporation as a G.m.b.H., and the like).

9. News-Letter Project: Immediate plans for a fortnightly communication to all CONGRESS sympathizers, the press, etc. should be started, completed. A 2-4 page mimeographed information-bulletin will keep alive CONGRESS interest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 231

### III SOME LARGE CCIE LONG-RANGE PROFOCALS

1. Film Proposal: a series of causes documentary film, possibly produced in connection with other organizations. Suggestion for a first film: a full-length feature on World-Communism, a script for which (The Hammer & The Sickle") has been outlined by W.J. Tucky and Stuart Schulberg (one of the leading U.S. documentary-makers, who would most probably be available in Europe for it. These could have normal camerucal distribution, special schools, and universities distribution.

2. Lecture Tour Proposals: building up a circuit throughout western-Europe, the United States, and elsewhere, for political and cultural CONGRESS speakers.

3. Research-Institute Proposal: this could be a normal and logical outgrowth of the first CONGRESS research activities. It would mean the establishment of a "Chatham House" on an international basis for serious studies of the cultural-political problems of our day. Scholars and journalists, on the basis of specific assignments and awards, could be associated with CONGRESS activities. This would be linked with the Paris and Berlin bureaus of the CONGRESS, with such international reviews as are affiliated with the CONGRESS (Der Monat", etc.), and with the CONGRESS publishing House.

4. University Proposal: a centre for Eastern exile professor and students, either in the form of an independent academic institution (the Czapeki resolution) - or perhaps in the more practical form of scholarships for the exiled students, and university chairs for the scholars - both is existing European and American academic institutions (Berlin Free University, Sorbonne, Zurich, Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, etc.).

5. School-for-Freedom Proposal: the organization, at first on a very modest summer-school-type basis, of a "George Orwell School for Freedom" (Hochschule fuer Freiheit), in which special courses and seminars in the political and cultural problems of our day could be given. Students could be invited land thus give the youth some measure of intellectual training): leading publicists and officials could participate. This could be associated with the Research Institute (one researchers become to chers and participant in the School Sessions), and with the University Project. "Congress cadres" could be developed here.

6. Proposal for Other National Bureaus: expanding into other European capital cities--Stockholm for Scandinavia, Vienna for the Balkans, Rome for the Mediterranean, New York and Havana for North and South America. It will, in any case, probably become imperative to establish a sub-bureau in New York City for the next period, so that American public opinion is not neglected.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY

SUBJECT: Congress for Cultural Freedom - an OPC organised accomplishment.

This is an Operational Report of an actual accomplishment. It is a subtle covert operation carried out on the highest intellectual level. It is unconventional warfare at its best in which the objectives are men's minds. It is the opening operation of a continuing campaign.

The origin and purposes are stated in Section I. The details in organising a delicate operation of this nature are only hinted in this report, but enough is expressed to arouse admiration for the principal operatives.

The report is already too condensed for briefing. I urgently recomand that you scan the whole of it.

MEMORANDUM FOR: M.McC. Bumstead, Stribling, and Ragedale

FROM: Charles Olmstead

SUBJECT: Confidential Report Received By Schiller on Berlin Congress for Cultural Freedom

1. When Mr. Stribling's shop requested me, at the behest of a cable request of Mr. Hambley, to attempt to appease Schiller in connection with his indignation for the manner in which Max Yergin, the American Negro, had been handled in Berlin, Schiller reacted in the manner described in my earlier memorandum on this subject, which was on the whole satisfactory. He has since received a complete report from a reliable and competent observer at the Berlin Congress which I am quoting below:

"On the whole, the Congress has achieved some useful results. In my opinion, the best thing about the Congress was that it was held in Berlin. A Congress in Paris, in Switzerland or in any other place would have had neither the same political significance nor would it have received the same publicity. For the Berliners, the fact that Berlin was chosen as the meeting place was renewed proof of Western solidarity with their resistance against the Russians. They need such proof again and again, especially in view of the fact that they have a definite and justified impression that the Bonn Government is not inclined to manifest any particular favor as far as help for the Berlin population is concerned.

"The Congress, moreover, has been a success Inasmuch as it showed the determination of an important group of intellectuals, scholars, and artiststo leave no longer unchallenged Communist attempts to dominate the scene through their various "cultural" front organisations. The permanent machinery established by the Congress for the purpose of continuing its work may be of great importance provided that certain conditions are observed in its activities.

"The following critical remarks regarding certain phases and features of the work of the Congress should not be construed as an attempt to deny the fact that the Congress has achieved a useful purpose. Nor is this criticism made from a perfectionist point of view. However, while it is admitted that in a gathering of artists, scholars, and writers, many of whom tend to display prima-donna attitudes and a spirit of coterie, a certain amount of friction is inevitable, it cannot be said that everything was done to reduce such frictions to a minimum. As a result, many delegates whom I had an opportunity to ask for their impressions of the Congress, left Berlin with mixed feelings, some of them not without a certain amount of disappointment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 235

While, the organisation of the Congress was excellent as far as the technical side was concerned, (hotels, public meetings, receptions, press interviews, etc.), the debates of the Congress took place under conditions which showed a considerable lack of imagination and ignorance of parliamentary procedure on the part of those responsible for the way in which the business of the Congress was transacted. Skeggs, Muhlen, and Bondy are certainly nice fellows with the best intentions. However, they seem to have had no previous experience at all on how to run a conference.

"All delegates had been asked to prepare papers on various subjects. It was obviously impossible to have all those papers read in the public meetings of the Congress (they were mimeographed and will be distributed). It was necessary to make a selection of topics and speakers. The best method would have been to appoint a steering committee which would have made this necessary selection with the maximum of objectivity. Unfortunately, this was not done. Instead, the question of who was to speak and how long was decided by Skeggs and his associates who did it in a rather arbitrary and haphazard manner. To explain what I mean let me cite a few examples:

First, the case of our friend, Max Yergin. Together with Max we worked rather hard on his paper (one night we had no more than two hours sleep). The final product received rather favorable comments from Hambley and Arthur Schlesinger. I tried to make Skeggs understand the importance of having Communist propaganda regarding the Negro problem answered and refuted by a competent person who is a Negro himself. Skeggs first promised me that Yergin would have fifteen minutes speaking time. When we arrived at the meeting where Max was scheduled to speak, he was told that he would not get more than ten minutes. He went to work again, and deleted some passages so as to have a ten-minute text. However, when Max was about to take the floor, he was informed by Bondy that he should not speak longer than five minutes. As a result, Max got confused and delivered a completely inadequate version of what he originally wanted to say. Similarly, Sascha Schwarz was prevented from making a report on the situation of the working class in Russia. Nor did the delegate from Spain and the one and only representative of Latin-America to the Congress have a chance to speak.

"On the other hand, Koestler spoke four or five times and there was generally a marked tendency to build him up as a kind of praeceptor mundi. He seems to have enjoyed himself in the role of a task-master censoring and lecturing the delegates. As far as I gathered from a conversation with Skeggs, Koestler was given this prominent place because, due to the fact that as a well-known writer, his pronounce-ments were supposed to attract public-attention in a greater measure than speeches by other delegates. The same consideration was evidently applied in the case of Silone. However, Silone seemed to be anxious to be as non-committal as possible, quite in line with his ambiguous political attitude. While Skeggs' preoccupation with problems of publicity is understandable, I do not think that the method of treating authors according to the sales of their books is apt to promote a lasting cooperation among writers, scholars, etc. For once, scholars will never be able to sell as many copies of their books as Koestler.

"At a cortain moment, the debates tock a very unfortunate turn. On one of the frequent occasions, when Koestler vas given the floor, ho read a paper wherein he attacked Socialism in general and the British Labor Government in particular. Considering 1) that about 70% of the delegates vere poople who professed socialist opinions; 2) that the purpose of the Congress required that a unity of all democratic intellectuals, both socialists and non-socialists in the struggle against totalitarianism be emphasized and 3) that the chairman of the Congrens das *Emet Reuter*, head of the social-democratic city government of Berlin - Koestler's attack vas absolutely out of place and should not have been made regardless of whether he was right or not. As a matter of fact, the paper in question proved that Koestler is mistaken in assuming that a brilliant Journalist and a successful rovelist is eo ipso qualified to play the role of a philosopher, historian and sociologist. In addition, mistaken statements by British Labor regarding the problem of Vuropean unity do not jpotify in my opinion the kind of vitriolic all-out attack against the British Labor Government which was made by Koestler who seems to have forgotten, that, regardless, what one may think of some of its policies, British Labor is today one of the principal pillars of the world democratic front."

Evidently Koestler's attack provoked immediate reaction on the part of the Socialist Congress delegates, beginning with Reuter who was in the chair. In my opinion, this entire discussion was completely unnecessary. The British conservative N. P., Amery, showed much better judgrant than Koestler by studiedly avoiding in his pronounce-ments, any criticism of the Labor Government. If an attitudo similar to that of Koestler would have been adopted in the trade union field, the I.C.F.F.U. could not have been created. As in the labor movement, the organization of intellectuals for the defense of democracy cannot be successful unless it is understood that democratic socialiom is a powerful influence among the best intellectuals of Europe and Asia and that, therefore, everything should be done to secure cooperation of all democratic forces in spite of all ideological differences. I was rather astonished to find that Irving scened to like Koestler's discourse on socialiss. I spoke with quite a number of dolegates and found that they didn't like it at all.

"Instead of appointing on the first and second days of the Congress a resolution Committee which would have been able to work seriously on any draft resolutions, proposals and suggestions made by the delegates, a draft manifesto and draft resolution vere submitted to a plenary meeting which had to decide on them within a few hours. That meeting appointed some committees who had exactly one hour's time to amend the resolutions. Of course, no serious work of rewriting and completing the resolutions could be done under such circumstances. You will notice that the manifesto treats the question of cultural freedom principally from the point of view of the Journalist and less from that of the scholar and the artists. At least this is my opinion. A draft appeal to the intellectuals behind the Iron Curtain, which wan submitted by Skeggs, evoked an immediate sharp criticism on the part of

the Folish and Zusalan delegates. The committee on which they were represented, amended it. However, later on not the azended text which was adopted by the Congress but the original draft was relonged to the press, thus cresting additional resentment.

"Yergin was not in a happy acol when ho left. A public meeting had been arranged for him and Schyler where they read their papers in full. However, they did act like the way they were treated insofar as speaking time at the Congress meetings was concerned and Pex made remarks to the effect that now the Communiste will say they had been jim-croved since they had to present their case in a special moeting. They also resented the fact that the perranent committee elected by the Congress does not contain any representative of the colored race. It would, of course, have been difficult to appoint one of thea to the committee since the representa- tion of the United States was lizited on urpose 80 as dito create the impression of American domination. However, the right of cooptation granted by the Congress to the permanent committes should be used to introduce as soon as possible in the committee intellectuals from India, Japan and cther non-white areas.

"Some of the papera read at the Congress were excellent, for Instance those of Frof. Muller (Schiller'e men) and Arthur Schlesinger to name only a fer. As far as the future work of the covencht initiated by the Congress is concerned, certain things should be taken into account to make possible the full use of existing possibili- ties which are culte favorable. 1) Representatives of Asia and possibly Africa should be drawn into the work of the committee. 2) All due rearect for literary fame, the organs of the new zovemont should not become a platform for the peculiar ambitions of certain individuals whatever their gifts and talents. 3) khile among the intellectuals it will probably be impossible to avoid discussion of so-called ideological problems, the purpose of such discussions should not be the struggle of rival ideologies, but the finding out of the points and areas where advocates of different ideologies may meet for cooperation in the defense of democracy against totalitar- ianism. 4) Establishment of contacts with other movements engaged in the struggle against totalitarianias, especially in the labor movement. 5) Eetter organizatica of the work of future congresses and conferences.

"The Congress undoubtedly reflected the progress made during the last year as far as the attitude of European intellectuals in concerned.. There is no trace of neutralistic attitudes in the resolutions of the Congress. The Base cannot be said of all the speeches. However, no openly neutralistic speech was made at the Congress. The only paper advocating a neutraliet attitude was withdrawn by its author, the Austrian physicist, Thyrring, when he heard of the Russian attack on Southern Korea. I wouldn't say that people like Rousset and especially Silone are cuite clear about the present world situation, particularly 18-far military defensensussiania concerned, hriever, they vely refrained from any openly neutralistic statements.

"On the whole, it can be said of the Congress that all is well that ends well. The criticism made above is not intended to contradict this general favorable impression."

2. I find on reading and rereading this criticism, that it is, in general, sour and sensible. I should like to repeat that particular attention be paid to the latter part of the memorandum in which five recommendations are made with regard to the future work of the movement initiated by the Berlin Congress. I should also like to draw particular attention to the reaction to the behavior of David Rousset and Ignazio Silone. This is one further indication for justification that Rousset must be constantly and thoroughly watched with a critical eye.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Kessrs. Thoapsen and Glazer

FROM: Charles Olrsteed

SUBJECT: Berlin Intellectual Congress

1. I wish to refer to Mr. Glaser's informal memorandum with regard to the mishandling of the American Negro, Max Iergin, at the Berlin Intellectual Congress.

2. When I informed Schiller that I wished to discuss this matter with him he proceeded to read to me a letter which he had just received from Berlin giving a rather full report on the Berlin Congress and which contained a great deal of information. Among the items reported on therein was the incident regarding Max Yergin. I explained to Scallier that it was a most difficult task to control the group of assorted Buropeans wno attended the Berlin Congress and suficient time wes not given, therefore, to United States delegates, but that Yergin's excellent speech, which had been cut off the radio at the microphone, wea being widely used in press, radio, dock and pamphlet form

3. Schiller accepted this explanation, but in closing our discussion of tais suspect, wise-cracked that our boys in Berlin did not include Yergin on any social doings and closed his remarks with the statement that Feven intellectuals like Furnnan don't like to sit down and eat with Negroes." I cnided him briefly and there the Eatter was closed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 241

Informal memo

Can you communicate this information to C.C. - as soon as practicable? (I will do so, if you prefer.)

A cable from Jim Burnham, states that Yorgin was not satisfied with the way he was handled at the Cultural Congress in Berlin.

His complaints:

His speech - described as "excellent" - was cut off at the microphone.

He did not, apparently, receive the kind of attention he thought was due him.

He is expected to make an adverse report to Schiller.

Burnham would like office to appease Schiller by assuring him that the staff of the Congress had their hands full trying to control the bunch of assorted morons there, and could not give sufficient time and attention to delegates. And that they intend to use Yorgin's excellent material in press, radio, book and pamphlet form, giving it wide distribution. In comparison to this, Burnham considers the actual promulgation at the sessions of the Congress a minor matter.

Dear Colonel Glaser:

Thanks for the testimonial. I am enclosing a copy of our financial statement to date. You will note that our expenses, exclusive of the books, were $917.05. However, this does not include our June telephone bill for phone calls and cables. I am skipping tom tomorrow before the laurel wreath turns into a brickbat.

The files and left-over stationery are being stored at Freedom House pending our decision on future activities. Er. Beichman has the check book and will pay the telephone bill and refund the balance when Jim returns.

My summer address will be 115 East Chester Street, Long Beach, L.I. Jim may want to contact me. I hope somebody will send me copies of the resolutions passed at the Congress. Will you please remind Jim for me?

Sincerely,

28 June 1950

"I talked with Allen dulles who stated that he knew nothing of this man's executive ability, that he does not know of any position he has held where that might have been exerted and added that he might be wrong on this factor. Stated further that he knew him as a *very* brilliant writer. With reference to his political idealism, Zowpas stated that he believed he was a Socialist and a little to the left; however, this factor was temperate with the statement that with regard to Fascist or Communist, he was definitely anti-Nazi and he believed tha he was anti-Communist. He continued by saying that he was a man of high character and that he personally liked him but that he would not consider him for an executive secretary's position. with further reference to the last point, he mentioned that he was basing this on the fact that he did not know of any executive position that the individual had held.

Dear Colonel Glaser:

Walter Mehring finally got off last night. There was no room on Saturday's plane for which he stood by, but he was scheduled to take a Sunday morning plane. Due to sane mechanical difficulty, that plane did not leave until last night. The American Express Co. was unofficially informed that as a result of President Truman's intervention all other planes were chartered for the stranded students. I even spoke to lir. Buttles about getting ir. Kehring on one of the chartered planes if the scheduled flight did not get off last night. If Mehring, too, did not turm up our counter-Grosz campaign would have looked bad. I therefore felt that he mistleave even if it meant being present at only part of the Congress.

I received a letter from George Grosz which I requested when I spoke to irs. Grosz:

"Here is my statement:

I regret not to be able to attend the Congress for Cultural Freedom. My reasons are entirely personal. I am delighted with your efforts to mobilize Art and scientists of the world for Freedom and Peace."

I cabled the text of the statement, signed with his name, to Berlin; and airmailed the letter and envelope to them.

Unfortunately Middleton of the *Times* is on vacation from Berlin. We seem to be getting better coverage in the *Herald-Tribune*, which has a by-line correspondent on the job.

Adolph Berle, as Chairman of the Liberal Party, cabled greetings to the Congress.

If anything goes wrong with the fruit crop in Perlin or anyplace in Europe for that matter, they'll probably blaze it on Muller's fruit files

Dear Mr. Williams:

Re: CONGRESS FOR CULTURAL FREEDOM
Mr. Elliot Cohen, Editor
*Commentary Magazine*

On May 22 the Foreign Service Educational Foundation authorized American Express to provide round trip transportation between New York City and Berlin to Mr. Cohen. The delegate advised us that air transportation would be unacceptable and that, because of commitments in New York, the only steamship sailing to which he could agree was the S. S. QUEEN ELIZABETH due to leave New York after last midnight.

Space on eastbound sailings at this season is at a premium, and on this particular one has been sold out for a considerable time, being actually under ticket. We exerted our best efforts in behalf of Mr. Cohen, but were unable to come up with the desired space. Mr. Cohen, on the recommendation of the line, we understand, attended the departure of the ship in the event that a passenger would be unable to sail and space be made available at the last moment.

An odd berth did become available in this manner and it was allotted to Mr. Cohen. The passenger borrowed from accomodating friends and made payment directly to the line. Will you authorize us to reimburse Mr. Cohen for funds he expended for his eastbound passage?

It would be of great assistance if we could have your reply on Monday.

Sincerely yours,

P. S. Since dictating the foregoing letter, I have been advised by Miss Kluger of the local New York office of the Congress for Cultural Freedom that is is Mr. Cohen's wish that reisbursement be made to Mrs. Cohen. I presume this arrangement will be agreeable to you should you find the reimbursement in order.

Colonel Louis Glaser

Washington, D.C.

Dear Colonel Glaser:

Report from Berlin: The story is Groszly exaggerated. The Stalinists have not even mentioned the Congress for the last two weeks. Berlin is seething over the Congress; the city is plastered with it.

Report from New York: Harold Lavine of Kensweek, at our instigation, spoke to Grosz who said that he is an artist, that he received numerous communications from the Eastern section of Germany about the Congress; that he is an artist and that he can't be bothered getting involved in so much correspondence. Newsweek will carry the story next week. Will Lissner of the Times is also interested.

Kempton did not carry the story; he was sidetracked by the distressing tale of the young girl Progressive Partyite who discovered the PP is not exactly democratic (her branch refused to hear Rogge on Tito). But the fruit flies made Lyons column (enclosed). Did you see yesterday's N.Y. Herald-Tribune? There was a good story on the Congress by Joseph Nomen from Berlin. I have only one copy; if I can get another, I will forward it.

Walter Kehring has his military permit for Ferlin; I hope that by this time he has cleared his income tax statements for the last three years w the Treasury Dept. (he is an alien), but as I haven't heard from him for the last three hours, presumably things are going well. The American Express Company is working on his ticket.

Tomorrow the last of the delegates are off. I will be around to answer any press inquiries during the weak of the Congress and then will close the office. I think the delegates can do their own worrying about the rubbers they left in Berlin.

I feel just like Cinderella - who never got to the ball.

Sincerely,

Pearl Kluger

MEMORANDUM FOR: RECORD

SUBJECT: OFC Operations in Connection with Whitsun Communist Youth Demonstration in Berlin

1. At the request of the Departments of State and Defense, we had asked the chief of the OFC German station to obtain a statement from General Hanwell D. Taylor, U. S. Commandant in Berlin, as to the effectiveness of the subject operations.

2. The cablegram from Lawrence De Neufville, Chief of OFC German Mission, dated 22 June, stated that General Taylor had asked Mr. De Neufville to convey his appreciation in the following terms:

a. "It has been of most positive value to my headquarters to know that lines of action outlined by our propaganda authorities have been disseminated throughout the Soviet Zone by a group such as yours. The success of the OFC mission in distributing over one million pieces of propaganda material before and during the Deutschlandtreffen is an achievement upon which the organization should be congratulated."

b. "Your mission is a delicate one in that you are specifically charged with avoiding attribution of your activities to any U. S. Government source or agency. This you have evidently succeeded in doing and it has been a matter of satisfaction to me to know that various matters that it was in our interest to accomplish could be performed by OFC without disclosing American interest or activity."

c. "If judgement from Berlin is of value to your organization, let me say that OPC work has proved its value during the Deutschlandtreffen. We are relying on similar or increased help from OPC in the future."

3. The German mission has advised that the original communication from General Taylor was pouched on 22 June 1950.

# Congress for Cultural Freedom

AP Berlin June 23

While the Communists planned their *peace rally*, the Soviet-controlled grip failed at a western-sponsored international: Congress for Cultural Freedom assembling 100 miles behind the Iron Curtain.

A vanguard of more than 100 anti-Communist intellectuals arrived today for the five-day congress which is to open Monday. Western scientists and political and trade-union leaders are to attend from a score of countries.

"Called 'Center Of Spies'"
The Communist press called the delegates "chained dogs of Wall Street," "an elite of renegades and Trotskyites," and said the congress was a "center of spies" and a "congress of warmongers."

Communists also claimed supporters of the congress were to blame for the fire which swept an East-German Communist clubhouse yesterday.

James Burnham, American author, said the congress "must proclaim positively that the Kremlin controlled 'partisans of peace' movements which meet in Stockholm. It must show this is now one way to peace; there is only one way to freedom—the American road."

Barge Detention Denounced:
Other Americans coming are David Lilienthal, former chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission; Tennessee Williams and Carson McCullers, playwrights; Robert Montgomery, actor, and Irving Brown, trade-union leader.

Meanwhile, the Russians refused a British delegation official ship and apparently tried to state up the cold war by aggressive provocations in the detention of 16 barges-on canals in West Berlin.

ΣΕΡΥ

June 11, 1950

Dear Doctor,

Very happy have given in your call of yesterday. I found when I got here confirmation of our room at Hotel de la Tremoille, 14, rue de la Tremoille, scheduled for July 15-24. (The rue de la Tremoille is a short street off Ave. Francois Ier.) We shall expect to see you there and then.

I enclose from yesterday's *New York Times* an item that you may not have seen. Our man seems to be doing just what's so far.

I had last night a lengthy telephone call from William Phillips (the editor of Partisan Review who was in Paris last summer and who was concerned in the plan for a French edition). Then Mel Lasch was here, Phillips did not invite Phillips or Stephen Spender (his co-editor) to go to Berlin, more or less as representatives of Partisan Review.  Now later burned the invitation down. An offer of special invitation was never given to Phillips. At least so I had been informed locally. I believe Mel Lasch to the fact that he was concerned both with Berlin and (especially) with the French edition of P.R. is out, but that there is now in process a French magazine which would have a special relation to P.R. (He made a footnote in confidence, about who is supposed to be concerned in this magazine - and I, for one, am not altogether easy in my mind on the matter.)

In any case, Phillips thinks that if a special P.R. connection is thought of, he probably ought to be involved a bit. Specifically, if the French magazine offers certain Americans something like the contact that Stephen Spender can have in Berlin; and that would offer more officials than Spender to Berlin, I thought he could offer services to Paris on the same basis. He suggested that if something were going on, I could also work on it when in Paris in July.

I bring this to the attention of you and your friends: (I told Phillips that I would see in Berlin as soon as I got there how things stood. He said that he would be ready to leave at once if he were invited.)

His own opinion tends to be: 1) Phillips should not be invited merely for Berlin, since there are enough Americans; 2) and if there are to be more, another type is more important; 3) However, Partisan Review - that is, the American connection - should be in the French magazine setup, thoroughly from the beginning; 4) If, therefore, the French magazine is now going ahead.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 261

then P R should be represented before these unreliable French characters bist matters up: 4) a co-relation twin of Berlin and the French my wine might justice in invitation for Phillips - I rather that if he is invited to Berlin. He will chance the Paris part of his trip; 5) it may, however, be that I, as a member of P R's advisory board, can sufficiently represent P R at this time. If it be in order for it to be represented.

Well, I bring this to your attention, and through you to whomever else's relevant. You might see that a comment on the matter reaches me next week in Berlin. My own hesitation in giving a definite opinion on it comes from the fact that I have not heard for nothing about the French marine prospect and plan.

Our friend whom Davnon met in New York seems worth pursuing at least a step or two further. I have more or less managed to get together with P Rin. He apparently has one quite precise identity, in the not too much I know about it now, sounds useful and possible.

We were delighted that Katherine and John were here.

We shall see you.

I have a complete, practically verbatim record of the meeting, but am setting down an extract of what took place.

Mr. McKnight stated that the meeting had been called to discuss ways and means of taking advantage of the Cultural Congress in Berlin by widespread dissemination of the product of the Congress, speeches, declarations, etc. Why would it not be a good idea to have Buttles communicate with Lasky and have latter send the material to Paris for publication in France, as well as here.

Mr. Neilson (ECA) said that speaking for ECA, they have a liberal view as to spending ECA funds and are anxious to cooperate with State, subject to limitations which are relevant to the present case, which are (a) expenditure to be approved on a project basis (b) a finger to be kept on the progress of expenditure (c) within certain totals. (1) keep away from the flamboyant and spectacular. (For instance, no large robe of ECA money to send US symphony orchestras touring through Europe.) Said Mr. Neilson, the Cultural Congress would fall within the zone of probable acceptability and should be a cooperative enterprise with State, to be cleared with ECA financial and legal advisers, but do not anticipate difficulty because the Cultural Congress is clearly related to the approved EJA policy of countering the Soviet peace offensive.

Mr. Buttles suggested that the best thing to do with product of Congress was to get local people to publish it; we furnish translations, paper, ink, etc.

The above suggestion led to one by Neilson that a Dissemination Committee might be formed, backed with our money. Buttles added that in addition to a more profound type job, there might be one for the unwashed public.

illustrations - and extracts of speeches.

Mr. McKnight concurred, thought we needed to work out the distribution problen cy use of a committeewhich would take charge of publication and distribution - 18 Lany languages. Buttlee added that we should use GermanG and German facilities to see that menuscripts and photos are made available.

(At this point I suggested to Buttles that there would be a question of sponsorship of material.)

McKnight and Buttles agreed that Lasky should be contacted and put in a position of discussing the matter with Neilson who is returning to Faris tonight,

Nellson Teilson added he would like to get together with Cody and other state people in Paris.

At McKnight's suggestion, Buttles said he would communicato with Lasky and aer la to come to Paris to talk about the matter with Neilson.

Following are actual quotes:

Neilson: "I don't know a great deal about this Cultural Congress, is it apt to produce a major offensive against the USSR and against the peace offensive?"

MeKnight: "yes, I think so. They are a very important bunch of people."

Kelorek: "They are big names. Very high calibre, very impressive; their discussions could be dynamite in putting over telling ideas."

Neilson then pointed out that EJA was going to be in the business c' using very important crganizations of all kinds in Europe (gave some Italian references) but thought that because of the temporary character of A such a thing as deve elmopment of the Cultural Congress should be turned over to State or CIA to handle and continue. (Somewhere previously I had asked Buttles, in crder to make a point, whether the Congress was going to be self continuing Bruce said he thought so.) Neilson said we should develop a full head of steam on the proposition and then should not drop out, should be continued by State through Lasky, or by CIA... (Actually was a plea for CIA to take notice of the Congress and take it over.)

McKnight then asked me if CIA was interested in the propo-
sition as a whole. I replied it seemed very interesting.
He then said if a conference was arranged in Paris would we
like to have a CIA representative there, I answered I
thought we might like is to have someone. I tien asked
Buttles if he was sure Lasky would go to Faris - Buttles
said he would try to arrange to have either Lasky or Josselsm
(which was the reply I hoped for.) He said they were both
State department people, both familiar with the Congress.

In effect, that was the end of the conference. MoKnight.
againg said that CIA should certainly be cut in on the
proceedings from now on because of their future interest
in the. Congress.

Time of meeting: NEILSON REQUESTS THAT IT TAKE PLACE AFTER

I suggest that a cable be sent to Mike explaining exactly
what is in the wind (info to Larry.) Personally I would
decide to send either Lasky AND Mike, or Mike, or Lasky and
Larry, or Larry alone. hey wought to be advised at once.
That ECA is willing to provide funds for production of
a million copies of the speeches of the Congress and other
publicity. Neilsoneaid that labor committees and
other cooperative groups might be used for dissemination.
However, the greatest caution must be exercised to see that
a committee on publications, or words to that effect, is
appointed during the sessions of the Congress, and in my
opinion it should be an unwitting group, except for one
member; it should NCT have more than one US representative.
It MIGHT be entirely German, Again it locks as though Lasky
might have to be the secretary of such a group. I think
all they have to do is start a quick 'fund raising campaign'
for publications - and won't they be surprised at the

speed with which French, Italian, British and US organiza- tions -respond with lots of money for the purpose!
Buttles and I had a quiet talk after the conference this afternoon and he is entirely in sympathy with my point of view, anxious to cooperate and not entirely sure that Lasky is the right man to go single handed to Paris. This guy Neilson is a peach. Sharp, keen, responsive and a worker - sticks out all over him.

I feel like a sheep killing dog not to stay on the job and see this through, but I've only got one son and I hope he'll only be married once.. Please let me know if you need me; I will be at Hotel Fensgate, Bay State Road, Boston.

Also I think we should see that Burnham - or some other delegate - or several - touch on the Peace offensive, exposing it as a swindle - which would endear the Congress all the more to State and ECA - and is well worthwhile in itself.

Memo of telephone conversation with Jim Burnham in New York

10 a.m. Thursday morning 15 June, 1950.

a. Contact with Burnham. In reply to my suggestion that I stop in New York Sat. morning to see him, discuss Congress affairs and deliver a pistol, Burnham replied that he was leaving this afternoon for his camp in Connecticut, would not return until Saturday night, was flying on Sunday morning. He suggested that there was little necessity for additional discussion of the Congress, that if any papers or articles (the pistol) were to be delivered to him, they could be sent by mail or otherwise to his address, care of Mrs. Claude Burnham, 3 E 69 St., telephone Rhinelander 4-47890; the address is a safe one, he says, with a trusted doorman on duty and a maid in the residence. (Not safe from our point of view - but presumably nothing classified is to be transmitted.) Discussed this with Smith who says he will arrange to get pistol to Burnham.

b. Between now and Sat. night, Burnham will be at his camp in Connecticut, telephone: Kent 78, Ring 1 - 2.

c. Matter of extra expense to be allowed Pearl Fluger for gather signatures for cablegram to Congress, and for certain other incidentals connected with travel of delegates, Burnham's estimate this would not amount to more than $100. I authorized him to spend up to $150 for this purpose.

d. Matter of closing N.Y. office. I authorized continuation after July 1st only in form of one week's part time employment of Fluger, couple of hours a day and use of telephone.

e. Matter of permanent continuation of Congress office (presumably in Berlin); I said this should be discussed in Berlin, that we would expect a cablegram of recommendation before first of July, would immediately respond with a decision, possibly as to project amendment calling for funds for support of continuing office. (Impossible, I think, to anticipate decisions now as they would depend on success of Congress in attracting world publicity, furnishing base for continuing propaganda and arousing communist opposition.)

Dear Jim,

Thanks for letter of the 6th. Good to know that you and Marcia are due here so nice and early. Four more shoulders on which to unload the awful burden of this hard world.

What's this about not accepting the brilliant Aron-Koestler-Burnham Yemo? That is now our werking gospel. The International Committee lives on? No, no. It's been killed, it's dead. The five philosophers reign. The alphabetical order has come into new glory. Under separate cover you will receive the latest news from A to Z. New Correspondence paper is being printed. The program of the Congress will be the revised printed booklet which you already have.

As for the names, pretty kettle of fish you chaps fished together. We extended invitations. A few came up with affirm atives. Ayer from England, etc. Also Jules Romains, Now that she's coming, Koestler via telephone yesterday says, oh, oh. Well, why in the world was he put on the list when he's so wishy-washy? You can't have him without letting him speak. And he's tentatively scheduled for about 10 minutes on the open-ing Monday program. Also, by the way, Koestler informed he won't be able to turh up even for a day before the Congress. I am writing today to ask him to plan a short opening address to round off the somewhat too ceremonial opening program with a political-keyncting speech. You might write him too, if it won't be over-doing it.

Also unders separate cover,s some papers that we have been sending out.

See you soon.

Yours,

MEMORANDUM FOR: JOEN E. BAKER
Chief, KE III

SUBJECT: Letter of Instruction for Kenneth H. Hambley

1.  Accompanying the approval of subject letter of instruction, it was requested by AIFC that I prepare a memorandum of my conversation with Mr. Richards covering arrangements for the travel of Hambley's wife.

2.  On 31 May I saw Mr. Richards of Confidential Funds Division and explained the situation to him. Mr. Richards gave the following opinion:

Mrs. Hambley may travel to the Cultural Congress, at the invita- tion of the Congress, in her own right, drawing money from the travel fund for the purpose of such travel without consideration of Hambley's status vis-a-vis CIA. This on the theory that whether or not Mrs. Hambley is a delegate to the Congress, her travel may be considered necessary because of services she will be expected to render, and also because her presence will protect her husband's cover. The Cultural Congress is ostensibly financially independent. It would, therefore, make any such arrangements without consideration of CIA rules regarding the travel of employees and agents.

14.3.50.
Bericht Nr.12.

Die Veranstaltungen im Haus der Kultur der S.U. zeigen eine aufsteigende Linie. Den Gästen wird ein immer vielseitigeros Programm dargeboten. Immer mehr Besucher, davon viel Stammgäste, stele len sich ein. Damit steigt auch die sirkung, der Einfluß im Sinne der sowjetischen Gastgeber bei deutschen breiten Volkamassёл.

Anläßlich des dreijährigen Bestehens des baudes gab die Gem schäftsführung auf großen dekorativen Sandtafein bekannt, daß 1947 105 Vorträge stattfanden, 1948 waren es 197 und 1949 schon 328 gea worden. Gegenwärtig gibt es in einer Woche mitunter etwa zehn Vorträge, meist mit anschließendem Film, daneben zahlreiche musikalische und künstlerische Vorstellungen und die eigentlichen Filme, im Monat annähernd zehn verschiedene. Berücksichtigt man dazu noch die ständigen Ausstellungen, die stets lebhaft besucht werden, und häufige festliche Versammlungen, so kann man schätzen, daß mindestens zweitausend Menschen täglich (mit Ausnahme eines Ruhetages in jeder Hochet) das Haus der Kultur betreten. Sie werden auch durch die repräsentative äußere Aufmachung und die kostenlose Betreuung beeindruckt. Solche Mäuze kennen manche (wohl die meisten) Besucher nur aus Film oder Bändern, und auf seidendamast bespannte Polstermöbel aus Schloß Sanssouci können sie sich sonst auch nicht setzen.

Die Vorträge kann man ihrem Inhalt nach in einige Kategorien aufteilen. Da gibt es solche, die das Grundsätzliche und Dogmatische der Parteilehre erläutern. Hierzu gehört etwa "Die marxistisch-leninistische Lehre vom Staat" oder "Klassen und Klassenkampf" oder "Materialismus oder Idealismus"; ferner Vortragsreihen Uber Lenins berke oder über die Geschichte der Partei der Bolschewiki.

Andere Vorträge haben außenpolitische Fragen zum Gegenstand, z. B. ein Vortragszyklus über die Außenpolitik der UdSSR, ferner über den "Sieg der Volkskräfte in China", über den "Freiheitskampf der kelonialen Völker" oder die "Hintergründe der amerikanischen Außenpolitik".

Weitaus die meisten Vorträge befassen sich mit inneren Zuständen der UdSSR. Es ist selbstverständlich, daß alle Einrichtungen der Sowjetunion im günstigsten Lichte dargestellt werden. Der Hörer erfährt von Macht und Reichtum, Fortschritt und Rekorden der Sowjetunion und von den vorbildlichen Leistungen ihrer Einwohner. Einige charakteristische Themen lautetens "Bodenschätze der S.U.", "Der Nachkriegs-Finfjahrplan", die "Stachanow-

Bewegung" und "Der Fian sur "awandlung der Natur". Auch über den "Lebensstandard der Jerktätigen" wird berichtet, über den Staatse haushalt der UdSER, Bher Volksbildung, Sport. Leben der Frauen und dergleichen mehr. Das Programa ist vielseitig und findet immer eine interessierte Hörergemeinschaft.

Hieran reihen sich auch deutsche Themen. Während die vorgenannten Vorträge vorwiegend von sowjetischen Offisieren oder Funktionären gehalten werden, holt man zur Behandlung der Deutschland betreffenden Fragen meist "prominente"" Persönlichkeiten der S.E.D. und der ostdeutschen Regierung oder solche, die bekanntermaßen mit deren Ideen sympathisieren (s.d. Minister Rau, Prof. Gerhart Eisler, Dr. Kurt Fischer, Wilhelm Koenen, Arnold Zweig u.s.w.). Gegenwärtig steht die Politik der "nationalen 716 Front" im Vordergrund. Soweit Musik von hervorragender Qualität geboten wird, ist sie meist auf die gleiche politische Tendenz abgestimmt. Auch den verschiedenen volksdemokratischen Ländern sind bestimmte Vorträge und Filme gewidmet.

Die Ausstellungen gehen ständig nebenher. Jetzt gibt es u.a. eine solche über sowjetische Architektur, die meisterhafte Riesenphotos der größten und schönsten modernen Bauten der UdSSR enthält, Regierungspaläste, Theater, Arbeiter- großwohnhäuser, Sanstorien, Bahn- und Hafengebäude, Farks.

Eine über die sowjetische Armee steht vor der Eröffnung.

Andere Ausstellungen zeigten oder zeigen Leistungen der sowjeti schen Malerei, Graphik, Flakatkunst, Bücher und Kinderbücher, Bühnenbilder, Material zum Leben von Lenin, Stalin, Gorki und Pusohkin, Filmwesen, 800 Jahre Moskau, Fünfjahrplan, Geschichte der kommunistischen Fartel und Kampf um den Frieden u. dgl.

Stets gewinnt man den Eindruck, daß der Betrieb im Hause mit Hilfe reichlichen Fersonals sorgfältig organisiert ist.

16. März 1950.
    Bericht nr.19.

Über die "Nationale Front" des "demokratischen" Deutschlands im Tageskampf sprach Wilhelm Koenen am 16.3.50. im Haus der Kultur der S.U. Der Theaterraum war voll; viel Polizisten als Zuhörer. Koenen, prominenter SED-Bonze, linientreuer Mann des "Volksrats", ist ein typischer Agitator und Demagoge. Er spricht mit lauter, geschulter Stimme, lebhaft und einprägsam. Dabei reiht er Phrasen und Schlagworte aneinander, ohne eigene Ideen zu entwickeln. Aber der kritik und urteilslose Hörer erliegt leicht seinem Wortschwall. Scharf und heftig sind seine Ausfälle. Adenauer ist der "skrupellose Vertreter amerikanischer Monopolinteressen" und nebenbei ein Schwager zweiten Grades von Mac Cloy" und hat Westdeutschland leichtsinnigerweise mit mindestens 35 Milliarden Westmark Schulden belastet, während die "Deutsche Demokratische Republik" schuldenfrei dasteht. Elend, Verfall und Hoffnungslosigkeit herrschen in Westdeutschland. "Bei uns (d.h. im glücklichen östlichen Teil Deutschlands) geht es schrittweise voran, während es im kolonialen Deutschland (gemeint ist der Westen) sprungweise zurückgeht!", rief Koenen aus.

Der Redner forderte, daß die politische Agitation in ganz Berlin sowie in der Ostzone planmäßig verstärkt werden solle. Überall sollen Agitationstrupps geschult werden. Sie sollen z.B. in kleinen Gruppen in den Berliner S- und U-Bahnen durch laute Gespräche im Sinne der "nationalen Front" die Öffentlichkeit "aufklären". Im Ostsektor und in der Ostzone sollen sie Verständnis wecken für die (von der SED und ihren Auftraggebern) geforderte vorfristige Erfüllung des Zweijahrplanes sowie für ein neues Gesetz, das die Ablieferungspflicht der Landwirtschaft erhöht. Auch das Einsammeln von "Buntmetallen" soll durch die politische Organisation bis herunter zu den Hausobleuten gründlicher betrieben werden. Daneben soll die "Wachsamkeit" (auch ein Wort typisch moskauer Prägung) gegenüber den Lauen und widerspenstigen verschärft werden. Zur Erläuterung, wie und wo die Gefahr von "Saboteuren" droht, wurde anschließend der Defa-Film "Der Auftrag Hoegners", der schon oft im Hause gelaufen ist, nochmals gezeigt.

Die deutsche Bevölkerung steht, wie Koenen ausführte, vor einem entscheidenden inneren Kampfabschnitt. Es gilt, die Schranken zu beseitigen, welche die "nationale Front" noch von ihrem Ziel trennen, ihre Grundsätze auf ganz Deutschland auszudehnen. In diesem Sinne soll das Fringstreffen der deutschen Jugend zu mehr als einer Demonstration werden. Ganz Berlin soll damit gewonnen werden...

"Cuno" - Bericht ar.13. /Fortsetsung/

Berlin ist (laut Koenen) 14/14 der Mittelpunkt nicht nur Deutsch-lands, sondern des Blocks der Volksdemokratien und ganz Europas! Ohne Berlin kein Friede, keine "Freiheit", keine Einheit Deutsch-lands. Der jetzige Zustand, daß Testberlin sich dem Herrschafts-anspruch der "nationalen Front" entzieht, muß beseitigt werden.

Etwa die zweite Hälfte des Koerenschen Vortrags beschäftigte sich mit den Vorgängen bei der Demontage in datenstedt-Salzgitter und enthielt drastische Konzentare zu den Pressenachrichten der letzten Tage. Koenen schilderte den erfolgreichen Biderstand der deutschen Arbeiterschaft gegen die Zerstörung ihrer Arbeitsstätten, gegen aggressive Pläne der Westalliierten. Am Schluß des Vortrags meldete sich zur Diskussion nur ein Mann-aus den Publikun mit dem Vorschlag, der Belegschaft in Watenstedt-Salzgitter die Sympathie aller Versamelten telegraphisch auszusprechen. Die Resolution wurde in Abstimmung einstimsig angenommen.

Bericht Sr.14.

Die Sowjetarmee - das Bollwerk des Friedens und der Sicherheit in der ganzen Felt

ist das Actto einer Ausstellung, die am 17.3.50. im Haus der Kultur der Sowjetunion eröffnet wurde.

In einer blumengeschmückten Vorballe und drei Räumen sieht man Bilder, Landkarten mit Erläuterungen und großplakatierte Zitate. Das ganze könnte man als einen kriegsgeschichtlichen Schnellkursus der sowjetischen Armee bezeichnen. Waffen, Uniformen und dergleichen, was sonst in Heeresmuseen zu finden ist, werden hier nicht gezeigt. Auch technisch ist über den heutigen Stand der Armee nichts Neues zu entnehmen. Die Aussteilung trägt mehr ideologischen Charakter und eine bestimmte politische Tendenz. Die äußere Ausstattung ist dekorativ sehr sorgfältig und künstlerisch gemacht.

Die Bilder beginnen zeitlich mit Gemälden aus der Revolutionszeit im Oktober 1917, als die ersten Trupps bewaffneter Arbeiter sich zur "Roten Garde" zusammenschlossen. Stets stehen schon hier Lenin und Stalin Seite-an, Seite.

Auf mehreren Landkarten werden sodann die Feldzüge des Bürgerkrieges illustriert, in deren Verlauf die Rote Armee nacheinander die fremden Invasionstruppen sowie ihre inneren weiß-russischen Gegner besiegte. Von Kärz bis Oktober 1819 ging es gegen die von Osten anrückenden Truppen Koltschaks, nachdem schon 1918 britische Expeditionstruppen von Murmansk aus vergeblich ins Land einzudringen versucht hatten. Bedrohlicher für die junge Sowjetmacht wurden damals (1919/20) die Vorstöße Denekins von Süden her, die jedoch Ende 1920 mit einem vollen Sieg der Roten Armee und Vertreibung der Gegner aus der Krim endeten. Auch des polnischen Angriffs erwehrte sich die Rote Armee. Schließlich gelang es ihr auch, in Kämpfen, die sich bis Oktober 1922 hinsogen, ihre Macht von Irkutsk bis Fladiwostok im Fernen Osten wiederhergustel-len. Die Rolle Stalins bei der Leitung dieser Unternehmen wird besonders hervorgehoben. Eine auf einem großen Tisch montierte Kartenskizze zeigt z. B. durch Fähnchen und Daten Stalins Fahrten durch das ausgedehnte Operationsgebiet zwischen Nordrußland und Kaukasus.

Der größte Raum wird durch Bilder aus dem letzten Krieg gefüllt. Darunter ist kaum Material, das nicht schon durch Zeitschriften früher bekannt geworden wäre. wieder seigen große Lage- und Bewegungs-Skizzen die Zerschlagung der Hitler-Armeen in groß=

angelegten, fur die Sowjetarmee siegreichen Schlachten.
Han kann sich deutlich vorstellen, wie die Schlachten vor Mos-
kau Dez. 1941, bei Stalingrad Sept.-Dez. 1942, bei Kursk und
Charkow im Sommer 1943 und schließlich im Raum um Berlin sich
abwickelten. Unter einem Bilde von einer sowjetischen Waffen-
fabrik steht: "Die sowjetische Armee errang ihre Erfolge mit
Waffen, die von sowjetischen Konstrukteuren gebaut sind."
In einer Inschrift zu 10 großen strategischen Bewegungen der
Armeen im Jahre 1944 heißt es: "In der so entstandenen Situation
war es klar, daß die Sowjetunion auch ohne Hilfe der Verbündeten
im Stande ist, ganz Deutschland zu besetzen und auch Frankreich
zu befreien".

Auf diese eigentlichen Kriegsbilder folgt eine Serie unter
dem Leitspruch "Befreiung der Völker". Man sieht, wie einrücken-
de sowjetische Truppen in Prag, Budapest, Bukarest und auch im
Fernen Osten von der einheimischen Bevölkerung jubelnd begrüßt
werden, und gewinnt aus Bildern von der Farade im Jahre 1947
vor dem Kreml einen gewissen Eindruck von der heutigen Stärke
und Einsatsbereitschaft der Armee. Bilder von besonders ver=
dienten Militärs finden sich in allen Abteilungen.

In Moskau und in anderen sowjetisvhen Städten gibt es auch
besondere Armee Theater, deren Aufführungen Themen von
Siegen, Feldherren und Heldentaten der sowjetischen Armee vers
herrlichen.

In diesem Rahmen mögen noch swei Filme erwähnt sein, die
kürzlich im Haus der Kultur der S.U. gezeigt wurden.

Der eine behandelt den 2. Teil der Stalingrad-Schlacht. Kein
eigentlicher Kriegs-Dokumentarfilm, d.h. keine im Kriege an der
Front gemachten Aufnahmen, sondern später mit Schauspieler und
Statisten Truppen gestellte filmische Handlung. Die Persönlich-
keit des Generalissimus Stalin steht im Vordergrund der Idee.
Der deutsche Beschauer erfährt, in wie sinnloser Weise der wahn-
sinnige Hitler Hunderttausende deutscher Soldaten in aussichts-
loser Lage dahin opferte. Das Publikum nahm den Film mit Ernst
und ergriffenheit auf.

Ein anderer Film "Die von Kronstadt" heroisiert den erfolg
reichen Widerstand Hoter Marinetruppen im Jahre 1919 vor Lenins
grad im Kampf gegen weißrussische Judenisch-Truppen. Je heftiger
gekämpft und geschossen wird, desto lebhafter reagieren die
sahlreichen Jugendlichen unter den Zuschauern. Der Film läuft in
russischer Sprache mit deutschen Unterzeilen.

SUBJECT: Status of Advanced Accounts (PDQUICK)

1. With reference to advances of money for FIQUICK, referred to in memorandum of 7 June signed by Chief, Staff III, four of those advances, involving participation of Mr. Carmel Offie, are itemized as follows:

$12,000 delivered to Mr. Offie on 25 April 1950 for which a receipt was obtained dated 27 April 1950 from Mr. Jay Lovestone of the Free Trade Union Conference.

$10,000 advanced to L. Glaser on 18 May for which a receipt is on file signed by Jay Lorentona dated 19 May.

$7,500 delivered to Mr. Offie about 20 May for which receipt is on file, this money delivered to National Committee For Free Europe.

2. The first two items referred to above report a duplication. This was called to Mr. Offie's attention on 26 May, again on 31 May, and again on 7 June. On those occasions, Mr. Offie stated that he was aware of the situation (that TUC had received an extra $10,000 for PEUICK) and that he would either have the money returned or would see that it was designated for another project. This adjustment is now in process for handling.

Dedicated to the cause of Peace Through Freedom

– "Peace Through Slavery" – i.e., as citizens both of free countries and of countries suffering Soviet tyranny.

Heartily hail the initiative of the Berlin Congress For Cultural Freedom in joining together intellectual leaders who cherish the freedom of the republics of the West, and seek the freedom of the peoples of the East.

And declare our hope that those nations which now temporarily endure Kremlin-imposed spiritual and physical bondage shall soon, by man's unsurmountable love of liberty, be restored to the fellowship of free men, free thought, and free expressions and that the cultural leaders of those nations will, after their liberation, take upon themselves the responsibility of enlightening their fellow citizens so long held in darkness.

# The Warden of St. Antony's

One bright afternoon in the fall of 1948, a big car made its way through the streets of Oxford, England, bearing a tubby little old man with a scraggly mustache, who had come to take his first look at the university. At that time few Oxonians had ever heard of 70-year-old Antonin Besse. Nor did they know that he was the mysterious, anonymous French millionaire who had just given Oxford one of the biggest gifts in its history—$6,000,000 for a new college (Time, Jan. 31, 1949). But by last week, the whole university was buzzing with preparations for Oxford’s first new college in 13 years.

To house the students of the newest college, Oxford authorities had acquired a small group of buildings once used as an Anglican convent. These they renamed St. Antony’s, in honor of Benefactor Antonin Besse. Then they began laying plans for the curriculum which St. Anthony’s students would follow:

Explosion in Yugoslavia. Antonin Besse had laid down only one stipulation. He wanted both Frenchmen and Englishmen to be admitted, to study in an atmosphere of Anglo-French cooperation. To create that atmosphere, Oxford picked as St. Antony’s first warden just the sort of independent-minded, well-educated Englishman Besse had learned to admire during the years he had traded and trav-

Ho is a German Jew, US citizen, lives in New York, in construction business, makes trips to Germany, knows German industrialists and politicians. About 55.

Offie kept his paper - is having it copied, will send us a copy.

S. was in Germany five or six weeks ago and was commented on critically and unfavorably in HICOG cables. Offie says this is because S. is disgusted with entire State and HICOG handling of German affairs, says people are either uninformed or incompetent or vicious, meaning by vicious the group of German Jews who were disciples of the Morgenthau plan, who hate Germany and Germans. He has let his antipathy to the HICOG crowd be seen and has avoided them. Offie suggested that Kellerman and Rheinstein probably were examples of the type that S. referred to.

He is now straightened out and has agreed that he will advise JL to add Vergin's name to his list and notify Am. Express. Yergin then simply draws his money from Am. Express.

MEMO: PDQUICK

Conversations with Mr. Carpenter (25 May) and with Mr. Richards (31 May) with reference to attendance at Cultural Congress of Mrs. Burnham:

Both Carpenter and Richards agree that Mrs. Burnham may travel to the congress, at the invitation of the Congress, in her own right, drawing money from travel fund for that purpose, without consideration of Burnham's status vis-a-vis CIA. This on the theory that the travel is desirable because of services she may render to the congress (not as a delegate necessarily) and because of the Merchants' cover. The Congress, as ostensibly independent financially, would make any such arrangements without consideration of rules of CIA regarding travel of employees and agents.

Subject: Information From Ar. MELVIN LASKY Concerning the Berlin Congress

1. I attach (a) a copy of the letter received from MELVIN LASKY, (b) a list which he prepared of the expected American delegates at the Congress, (c) together with three additions to the British list.

2. LASKY evidently means the American list to be definite as of this date. However, according to my information, at least two or three of the delegates non he lists are still uncertain; for example, SIONTY HOOK and DAVID LILIENTAL.

3. The Ldea of a strong Soviet delegation, gathered from Western Germany seems to me excellent, and capable of bajor exploitation as we noted yesterday. However, it does not seem to require SHUB's presence in Germany.

4. I don't know exactly what arrangements LAGT has in aind for continuing the payments necessary to maintain the Naw H.k office. One sentence in this letter suggests that he plans to make payment from Berlin. This matter ought to be clarified immediately.

5. You will note in the LASEY letter the address and telephone number of the New York office.

"Dear Jim,

"I have just finished with the press conference here at Freedom House.

I have given Beichman two hundred dollars for now; another two hundred has already gone in phone calls, telegram and the like. Spoke to Upton Sinclair again; can't come. Silone is writing the piece for the Times. look is doing an opening piece in the NL; with Levitas promising a nice spread. Beichman is writing letters, sending out releases.

Copy of letter from Melvin J. Lasky, Tuesday a.m. (5-23-50)

"Tuesday a.m.
Westover Air Field

"Dear Jim:

"I spoke to Prof. GERMAN ARCINIEGAS last night. He is probably the best known South American literary critic - now at Columbia University (N.Y.C.). He has agreed to come - writing a paper on 'Literarian Ideals in South American Literature'. ROMHALDI of the AFL in Washington tells ze he is very sound politically. ARCINIEGAS should be added to the list - giving us at least one non-North American.

"Best

/s/ MELVIN J. LASKY

"P.S.

"ARCINIFGAS is also having a little trouble with summer session committments. Could you ask BRUCE PUTTLES to have 'standard' State Dept. letter go out in ARCINIEGAS' behalf (release for about 10 days a la HOOK) to Prof. I. LEONARD, Romance Languages. Dept., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor..."

To: Colonel LOUIS GLASER

Subject: Information From Mr. MELVIN LASKY Concerning the Berlin Congress

1. I attach (á) a copy of the letter received from KELVIN LASKY, (b) a list which he prepared of the expected American delegates at the Congress, (c) together with three additions to the British list.

2. LASKY evidently means the American list to be definite as of this date. However, according to my information, at least two or three of the delegates whom he lists are still uncertain; for example, SIDNEY HOOK and DAVID LILIENTHAL.

3. The idea of a strong Soviet delegation, gathered from Western Germany seems to mo excellent, and capable of major exploitation as we noted yesterday. However, it does not seem to require SHUB's presence in Germany.

4. I don't know exactly what arrangements LASKY has in mind for continuing the payments necessary to maintain the New York office. One sentence in this letter suggests that he plans to make payment from Berlin. This matter ought to be clarified immediately.

5. You will note in the LASKY letter the address and telephone number of the New York office.

Copy of letter from MELVIN LASKY dated 21 May 1950, New York City

"Dear Jim,

"I have just finished with the press conference here at Freedom House. I think Beichman managed a nice turn-out - Hartrich of the Herald-Tribune, Darid Anderson of the Times, Kenry Beckkett of the Post, et.al. I won't be able to see the clippings tomorrow; doubtless much will be askew. But publicity won't hurt, and may do much much good. I have given Beichman two hundred dollars for now; another two hundred has already gone in phone calls, telegrams and the like. Spoke to Upton Sinclair again; can't come. Silone is writing the piece for the Times. Hook is doing an opening piece in the NL; with Levitas promising a nice spread. Beichman is writing letters, sending out releases. Pearl Kluger is working in the little office, hired out from George Field of Freedom House (20 Vest 40th Street, Tel: Chickering-4-3060). I have instructed him to consult you and refer all problems to you. I think he can do a most üseful job with the press. I have done my best to keep all such expenses down, but in the end this job will be more important than the expensive presence of many of the delegates in Berlin. Do keep in touch with him until your departure.

On the Russian matter, I think it would be an almost criminal waste of opportunities if there weren't the strongest possible Iron-Curtain delegation there on the platform in Berlin. Nicolaevsky and Shub have come up with the proposal to smoke out the professors, deans, scientists, poets now secluded in Western Cermany; five or six of these worthies (Russians, Ukrainians, Asiatics) would indeed be a most appropriate bombshell. If they- Nicolaevsky to give them Russian-political-confidence, Shub to give them American-diplomatic assurances - could have a week together working out from Frankfurt and Munich ten days or so before the Congress begins, this might turn the trick. I think that's the way, and probably the only way to do it. God knows I won't be able to round them up. In any event, - although I have been reluctant to raise the issue for fear that my motives might be misinterpreted - I think that Shub's presence in Berlin would be of immeasurable value, handling the radio and Russian angles; and he's not considered there another "American outsider". Which is important.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 309

- 2 -

* On the book matter, it would be wonderful if we could ge
  ahead with our project of book exhibitions of all works of
  Congress authors. I have asked Fearl Kluger she can be
  reached at the above number in Freedom House to go ahead
  with a limited amount of orders from the publishers. I trust
  there will be money to cover it; although some of the bills will
  go out to me in Berlin.

* I am leaving tonight for Westover Field. It was a big mistake
  not to get commercial air travel on my orders. No planes to
  Londen, none to Paris. First stop tomorrow Frankfurt! And there
  I turn around again. But then sy contract calls for no breakdowns
  until the first of July. See you in the sanitorius at that tins.

* Best regards to you and Marcia, and remember se to your children,
  who fascinated me.

Subject: Report on Distribution of Der Konat through an Exemplary Outlet

While in Berlin I acquired a copy of the repert dated March 13, 1950. I do not know whether it has been made available. The information in it seems to me interesting in itself and valuable for what it suggests in terms of further activities.

# 13 March 1950

Report on Distribution of Der Honat through an Exemplary Cutlet

1.  This describes the distribution activities of a single outlet, with connections primarily but not exclusively to students in the Sorist Zone. Since December 1949 the cutlet has been supplied 1115 sale copies and several hundred separate articles. At first single issues were, supplicä in numbers of 100, but because of rapidly increasing demand was later increased to 150 copies. However, the popularity of Der Monat has spontaneously led to a broader range of possibilities and a total of at least 330 coples fer issue has been requested. To provide a total of so many copies from number 8/2 to 16 inclusive will mein a further delivery of 1575 copies. A few copies of mumbers 5, 6 & 7 have been delivered as well as staplei single copies of George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and other articles taken by breaking un these same issues. Distribution has been free of charge and this has been emphasized to the contacts. It has been decided, however, to permit.contacts to ask a nominal East Mark price when dis- tributing a copy to an employed person. This would help cover the travel expenses of contacts to and from Berlin.

2.  Peactions to Der Monat delivery through this outlet has been overamelmingly encouraging. Each copy is said to change hands "at least" eight or nine times and as many as twenty tire s is considered usual. The result is that Der Monat has become widely known among students in the Eastern Zone. It is reported that it is even read openly in the mess-halls; SED stüdents procure it and read it, although when on their om they are said to be more secretive than the non-communist organized student. Certain articles have become icely knowm, particularly Graell's 14". An explanation of where the magazines come from is given in the following terms: they are bought for SOZON students by the Free University. It is generally accepted in the Soviet Zone that the Free University is the source of "anti- communist stüdent agitations" etc. Persons connected with the Free University who come in contact with East Zone students state that they are being continuously asked for coples of Der Monat, in the sense of "I've been getting it seventh hand; I'd like to get it first hand."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 316

3. Attention was continuously drawn to the popularity of Orwell's "1984". Hence the outlet asks whether it would be possible to make-up from broken minders single stapled copies of "184" recalling that this had been done for them in the case of *Animal Farm* and other articles.

4. The cutlet operates through an apparatus of couriers to all universities of the Soviet Zone. Universities are supplied by as many as four and an average of three different couriers, unknown to one another. Leipzig, Halle, Cera, Greifswald, Dresden and Rusteek are thus covered. There are a large number of delivery contacts at the Hunsoldt University. Also there are contacts to the "Landes Hochschule in Potsdam which is designed especially for training SSD functionaries, teachers, and key occupations. Couriers from other academic institutions and circles are also supplied, as well as to a number of non-academic circles of significant strategic value, as described below.

5. The following examples are cited:

a) At a recent four-zonal meeting of evangelical student-ministers from all zones fifteen copies were distributed to several SZ delegates. More could not be furnished because of lack of supplies at that time. The recipients-subsequently expressed such interest that regular delivery with a large number of copies has been established. The Karl Jaspers article was considered popular in this circle, and strong curiosity was expressed regarding "198" which was being discussed in the zone.

b) A professor of journalism at one Soviet-Zone university approached a contact for the copies, promising to make good use of them. He asked that they be supplied regularly and sent a student from Leipzig to confirm this and pick them up. Both student's and professor were checked upon and the delivery made.

c) A group of liberal and social-democratic students organized in the SED cooperate in a closed working-committee is recognized by the university as an academic activity of the faculty to which these students and professor belong. Monat articles are real and discussed and then translated into non-German languages and passed on as reading matter to trusted students in other sections of the Philosophical Faculty.

d) The CDC executive in a city in Saxony receives the magazine, using it as discussion material regularly at closed educational forums for training party functionaries. Three weeks age the article *Tito contra Stalin* was discussed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 317

e) Until recently a FDJ school for higher functionaries in Kecklenburg near the zonal border was supplied with copies of *Der Monat* which were read officially as the basis for working out counter-arguments. The connection was broken by the arrest of the courier, who was carrying *Telegraf* leaflets.

f) Twenty copies are regularly supplied for distribution to and through a Volkspolizei unit in Thuringia.

6. The outlet expresses great satisfaction with *Monat* distribution, considers it the ideal kind of reading for equipping oppositional students in the Soviet Zone with relatively safer and strategically suitable weapons, e.g. "ideas" and the "spirit of Europe". *Der Monat* is often contrasted with the *Telegraf* in this sense: *Der Monat* is not considered to exaggerate, is not the other pole, "with the truth somewhere between", but is respected and trusted for itself.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION

SUBJECT: CPC Liaison with the Department of State

PARTICIPANTS: CP1, ES-II, Chief ARB, Chief PFB, and FAD

1. Mr. Frank stated that recent cables from the CPC representative in Germany concerning the Berlin rally in May and the Congress in June had raised policy questions which required State Department coordination. He stated that as a result of these cables he had requested Mr. Harrison to discuss these policy questions with Mr. Joyce and had requested Mr. Joyce to arrange for the necessary liaison with the Office of German Affairs.

2. Mr. Harrison stated that Mr. Joyce had arranged a meeting in his office where Mr. Fairbo and Mr. Peter of CPC had discussed these problems with Mr. Kellerman and Mr. Strauss of the Office of German Affairs, together with Mr. Petviak. As a result of this meeting, the Office of German Affairs dispatched a State Department telegram to Nicos indicating that the Department was coordinating with CIA on a program designed to combat the effectiveness of the Berlin rally in May. This telegram received a wide distribution in Washington as well as in the headquarters of Nicop in Frankfurt.

3. Mr. Frank said that although he recognized the insecurity of the Office of German Affairs as evidenced by this telegram, he felt that it was essential for OPC to maintain liaison with the Office of German Affairs on policy matters. He proposed to recommend to Mr. Joyce that either Col. Pyrode or Mr. Geoffrey Lewis be designated as the liaison officer for the Office of German Affairs to deal with OPC on policy matters and subject to clearance in each instance with Mr. Joyce.

4. The undersigned agreed with Mr. Frank's proposal subject to the understanding that such liaison would be exercised under the existing policy laid down by ADEC, namely: that OPC liaison with the Department of State will be conducted only by ADEC, SADO, or CPP, and that if this authority is delegated it will only be done so when the individual authorized is satisfied that it is essential and can be controlled, and subject to the further understanding that such liaison will not involve operational details of OPC plans and operations.

Berlin Congress for Cultural Freedom, June 26-30, 1950.

Professor Sidney Hook, Head, Department of Philosophy, New York University.

Mr. Bruce Buttles, GAI.

GKR - Mr. Henry A. Byroade
S/P - Mr. Robert P. Joyce

The undersigned called upon Professor Hook at his home, 696-A Third Street, Brooklyn 15, N. Y., at 3:00 o'clock on April 22, 1950 to discuss domestic arrangements in support of the Congress, for which Professor Hook has been designated American representative. There were no other persons present.

Professor Hook opened the conversation by emphasizing the need to minimize the Government's interest in the Congress. He felt that it was essential to retain the appearance of a completely private venture. I assured him this was also the Department's view. Referring to the status of Melvin J. Lasky, secretary of the Congress in Berlin, as an employee of HICOG, Professor Hook then said he thought Mr. Lasky should be given a leave of absence in order to carry through the project in a private capacity. I promised to look into this problem, and commented that it could not be done readily without Mr. Lasky's cooperation. I also suggested that since Mr. Lasky to my knowledge was spending some of his personal funds on preparations for the Congress, it would only be fair to look for some other source of income for Mr. Lasky during such time as he might be on leave from Government service.

On continuing the discussion, it was clear that in working alone Professor Hook had as yet been unable to take any considerable progress on behalf of the Congress, and that there was urgent need for (a) a minimum staff to handle the progres in this country and (b) a szall allocation of funds to pay for telephone, stationery, publicity, etc. Until the present time, Professz Eock has been carrying the entire expense and verk hitself, and apparently has had to be extremely careful about such items as long distance telephone calls. For example, he felt he could afford to telephone Faciessar. John Dewey in Florida and ask his to sponsor the Congress (which invitation Professor Dewey accepted,) but he hesitated to put out the larger funds to telephone Upton Sinclair in California. Es would also like to call the Congress headquarters in Berlin, but felt that the transatlantic toil charge isas quite beyond his zeans.

In reply to by query as to what sort of budget would be necessary, Professor Hook suggested that he could need a secretary-typist for two months and a public relations on a part-time basis for the same period. He thought the cecretary could be obteined for $250 a month and the pub 1icity man for less than $500, La actition, $500 would be sufficient for such itens as rertal of typewriters, stationery, telephone calls, postage, etc. This would take a total budget of $2,000. The rental expense could be reduced, he thought, by using the offices of *The New Leader*, a Socialist publication of which he is one of the editors. He did not think it advis- able to have a pretentious office, since obvious affluence would incite suspicion. The activity could be organised by Americans for Intellectual Freedom, of which he is the founder. This group staged the anti-Commmist program in Hew Icrk in March 1949 for 1988 than $25.00

As to the expenses of American representatives going to Berlin, Professor. Fook hoped that it would not be necessary to use military trans- portation, since that would create the impression of Government sponsor- ship. He thought commercial transportation would definitely be preferable, and added that he would like to be in a position to give cash grants to the delegates of about $700, that is, the round-trip fare plus a few dollars over for incidentals. He felt it would be undesirable for too large an American representation to be sezt. Frobably six or seven people sould bo enough. This would mean a tressportation budget of less than $5000.

Several times during the conversation, Professor Lacky étressed that it was not necessary to have a large sus of money. For what was needed, he said, the right people could hardly be paids it was essential, he said, to have *dedicated personnel* who were willing if necessary to make per- soml sacrifices.

On the other hand, he thought it vital to have the right sort of publicity. The press arrangements should to carefully made. He hoped thet someone in washington could ask Mr. Forry Luce of *fire* and *Life* and Mr. A. E. Salsberger of the *Ess York Hess* to arrange the right sort of coverage, that is, the right people, such as Anne O'Hare licCormich of the

of the Times. He would like to invite Luce himself, but doubted if it would be politically desirable. At this point, I suggested inviting Mrs. Clare Booth Luce, and Professor Hook thought that might be the answer to his dilemma.

To handle the publicity Professor Hook thought he might hire Arnold Beichman (20 East 24th Street, New York), who is editor of a trade union paper in New York. Beichman handled press matters successfully for the anti-Communist demonstration last March. Professor Hook could make the first necessary arrangements himself, but would be glad to have any offer of assistance come to him through the offices of the New Leader, at 7 East 15th Street, New York 3. Telephone: Spring 7-8260.

I suggested that there was some indication that the Advertising Council might be able to find some space or other publicity assistance, and Professor Hook said he would be most grateful for that type of help. He hoped that the people concerned would approach him in the near future.

MEMORANDUM FOR: SALO

SUBJECT: Congress for Cultural Freedom

One of the most pressing problems in connection with the proposed Intellectual Freedom Congress to be held in Berlin is the matter of providing funds for transportation of delegates. We have conceived the possibility of two or three organizations overtly financing trips for cultural and intellectual leaders from various countries. The money thus provided will be deposited with the American Express Company with instructions to honor transportation requests from persons holding bona fide invitations to the Congress endorsed by one of the sponsoring organizations.

It is expected that there will be a total of approximately 60 delegates. At this date, the following persons have been invited:

England

Bertrand Russell, Philosopher
Julian Huxley, Biologist
R.H.S. Crossman, M.P. and Author
Victor Gollancz, Publisher
Stephen Spender, Editor

France

Congress for Cultural Freedom

TO:

Jonathan S. Gearing

1. Berlin newspapers have recently carried a dpa announce- ment of a Congress for Cultural Freedom to be held during the last week of June 1950. The notices in DER TAGESSPIEGEL and DER TAG of 2 April and in DIE NEUE ZEITUNG and TELEGRAF of 4 April were all similar and brief - about one inch in length. DAS BERLINER STADTBLATT (Social Democrat) of 2 April, however, carried a large(2"x 7"), front-page article.

2. The dpa text of the former newspapers was generally as follows:

A Congress for Cultural Freedom will be held in Berlin during the last week of June. The Berlin Committee which is preparing the Congress consists of Ernst Reuter, Lord Mayor of Berlin, Professor Edwin Redslob, Rector of the Berlin Free University, and Dr. Otto Suhr, Director of the Berlin Hochschule fuer Politik. Melvin J. Lasky, Editor of the international review DER MONAT, will act as General Secretary to the congress.

3. The article in the Berliner Stadblatt contains the infor- mation of the dpa release and adds the following:

It is believed that a large number of prominent writers and men of learning will attend the Congress. Among others, the following men are expected to parti- cipate: Author Ignazio SILONE (Italy), Professors Julian HUXLEY (England) and Sidney HOOK (USA), Poet Arnulf OVERLAND (Norway) and Ture NERMAN (Sweden) as well as David ROUSSET and Arthur KOESTLER.

1.  I refer to the attached memorandum of 7 April 1950 addressed to you by Mr. Glaser.

2.  I refer particularly to paragraph 4 sentence 2 of the above memorandum and to FRAN 117 paragraph 1, B.

3.  My suggestion in this regard is as follows:

I suggest that we do not desire for FDQUICK a Rhino Circular to Embassies similar to the circular supporting QKIVORY, because a circular of that sort is not essential and would unnecessarily invite attention to the U. S. interest in FDQUICK.

CIRCULAR AIRGRAM
21 June 1949

TO: Certain American Diplomatic Officers

The Formation of National Committee for Free Europe, Inc., with headquarters in New York, was announced on June 1, 1949. This Committee is a private organization concerning itself with democratic leaders and scholars who are exiled from the following countries: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. The Committee will be financed by private contributions.

The following is quoted from a statement issued by Joseph C. Grew, Chairman of the Committee in announcing its formation:

"Our program begins with the tangible fact of the presence here of these exiles and refugees. There is an American tradition of hospitality to political refugees. The promise which we gave at Yalta remains unredeemed. More than that we have a definite self-interest in helping to keep alive, and in full vigor political leaders who share our view of life--leaders who have refused to knuckle under, men who have not hesitated to risk their lives for their democratic faith. As item No. 1 in our immediate program we propose--have in fact already begun--to find suitable occupations for these democratic exiles... we are setting out to find suitable positions for them in colleges and universities. We are proposing to ask others of them to prepare studies on topics for which they are especially equipped... At the same time we are encouraging each national group of exiles to draw together politically--all democratic elements, that is, these other than Fascists or Communists--in order to form in their temporary American haven National Committees which can stand as symbols of democratic hope for their countrymen in Eastern Europe.... We look forward to the day when there will no longer be an Iron Curtain....and these six nations which we helped liberate from the Nazi oppression will be free from the Communist oppression and once more can organize their existence in their own way. When that time comes there will be something close to social chaos and political vacuum, for the first effort of totalitarian regimes is to destroy all constructive elements which might build anything different from themselves. Looking forward to that historic and critical time we have in mind that, if meanwhile democratic leaders have been helped to keep alive and in vigor in the democratic havens to which they have been driven we can hope that, returning, they will have parts in a democratic reconstruction. Our second purpose will be to put the voices of these exiled political leaders on the air, addressed to their own peoples back in Europe, in their own languages, in familiar tones. We shall help them also if we can to get their messages back by the printed word... If course we are not going to compete with the Voice of America. We shall en-"

deavor to supplement the Voice of America, for the Voice is
under restrictions by reason of its official character. It is
our American habit not to leave everything to government. In
the field of the contest of ideas there is much which private
initiative can accomplish best. The third and final point in
our immediate program is to set out at once to bring the exiled
leaders into a broad contact with American life. Our idea
is to enable these proven champions of democracy to see with
their own eyes how freedom and democracy are working out in the
United States ...I have no doubt that as we go along other
activities will be added to our program..."

Members of the Committee, as of 1 June 1942 were: Frank Altochul
(Treasurer), Hamilton Fish Armstrong, A. A. Berle, Frances Biddle,...
Robert Woods Bliss, Hugh A. Drum, Allen W. Dulles, Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Mark Ethridge, James A. Farley, William Green, Joseph
C. Grew (Chairman), Charles R. Hook, Arthur Bliss Lane, Henry R.
Luce, Arthur W. Page, DeWitt C. Poole (Executive Secretary),
Charles H. Spofford, Charles T. Tart, DeWitt Wallace, Matthew Woll.

For your information, the Department has been continually in-
formed of the process of formation of the Committee, although the
Department has no active concern with the Committee's activities;
it has given its unofficial approval to the Committee's objectives.
Because of the implicitly political nature of the Committee's work,
there will be coordination between it and the Department. We expect
that the Committee will cooperate in every way toward the accomplish-
ment of our objectives in Eastern Europe and of the general aims of
our foreign policy.

# CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

6 April 1950

MEMORANDUM FOR: ADPC

VIA:

COP

SUBJECT: CPC Plans for Counter-action against the Deutschlandtreffen.

1. In compliance with your request, there is submitted herewith a report on CC covert operations, in progress or under consideration, to counter the Communist-sponsored Free German Youth rally, (Deutschlandtreffen), scheduled for 27-28-29 May in Berlin.

2. The initial objective of OFC counter-action is to so harass, hinder and frustrate the Deutschlandtreffen that it cannot to used as a weapon to oust the Allied Powers from the Western Sectors of Berlin. If a substantial degree of success is achieved in that phase, major effort could then be directed toward instigating anti-communist demonstrations in the Soviet sector, thus turning the rally entirely to Western advantage.

3. The CPC program for this event is designed to supplement and reinforce overt activities planned by occupation authorities to achieve the same objective. All OFC operations directed against the Deutschlandtreffen either have been or will be cleared with appropriate civilian end military officials, with whom high level liaison is maintained in the field.

4. A major criterion of OFC activities is that they not be directly attributable to the U.S. government. Hence they fall into two classes:

a. Those conducted by entirely clandestine means and not attributable to any actual source, and

b. Those attributable to indigenous individuals and groups, with official U.S. instigation or support concealed.

In view of the strongly pro-Western and anti-Soviet orientation of the Berlin population generally, the second type of activity offers exceptional opportunities to inspire, guide and covertly assist actual German resistance to the rally.

5. Activities


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 349

5. Activities in various stages of planning or implementation by OPC include the following:

## A. Propaganda:

Preparation of 750,000 anti-communist leaflets by the *Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit*, an indigenous German organization sponsored by OPC, to be distributed during the rally;

Staff preparation of at least two counter-rally pamphlets, to be distributed by clandestine networks into the Soviet Zone prior to the event;

Preparation by a controlled German attorney of indictments stressing illegal aspects of the rally, including the matter of parental responsibility for minors;

Instigation of letters of warning from West Berlin students to acquaintances in the Soviet Zone;

Planning for special editions of one or more West Berlin newspapers to be distributed free during the rally;

Subsidizing distribution of 150,000 extra copies of the magazine *Freundschaft*, organ of a West Berlin anti-communist youth group;

Consideration of publishing fake editions of Communist newspapers, containing propaganda of deception and confusion;

Preparation of a letter, addressed to Soviet Zone clergymen, asking them to use their influence to keep young people out of Berlin during the rally;

Inspiring West Berlin newspapers and the U.S.-licensed radio station, RIAS, to carry material favorable to U.S. aims before, during and after the rally.

## b. Harassment and Deception:

Promotion of a rumor campaign to the effect that Communists are eager to have German young people killed and injured during the rally, to provide martyrs for the Moscow cause;

Promotion of another rumor campaign to the effect that Communists plan recruitment of rally participants for labor in Russia:...

Circulation

Copy #2 F1027


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 350

-3-

Circulation of a forged order, indicating that the rally actually is a device for recruitment of German youth into the Soviet Zone People's Police;

Planting a news story to the effect that the rally came about as the result of direct orders issued by Moscow to Walther Ulbricht, German Communist leader, on the occasion of his recent visit to the Russian capital;

Taking offers to provide billetting for rally participants in ruins, unsavory hotels or other undesirable space;

Consideration of disrupting transportation and other rally plans by issuance of false orders and proclamations;

Obtaining FDJ uniforms for possible use by agents of disruption;

**a. Counter-Attractions:**

Sponsorship by the Kampfgruppe of a fireworks display the evening of 29 May:

Covert guidance and encouragement of West Berlin merchants to prepare attractive displays of merchandise, illustrating the relatively high standards of Western living:

Covert sponsoring of free, or low-priced motion picture shows, featuring especially interesting films:

Covert sponsoring of sports events or other mass attractions, designed for the double purpose of maintaining West Berlin morale and distracting rally participants;

Approximately three weeks after the rally, covert sponsorship of a cultural and intellectual congress in Berlin--one of its objectives being to unmask the hypocrisy of communist intellectual appeals to youth.

**d. Counter-Violence:**

If, and only if, high policy considerations require, covert organization, support and guidance of pro-Western indigenous street-fighting units to meet a display of force with greater force.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 351

3. In addition to the foregoing plans, further opportunities unquestionably will arise for OFC direct activities or support to indigenous German groups with plans of their own to counteract the rally.

7. CPC is reinforcing its German staff with all available qualified personnel, and is prepared to set aside such sums of confidential funds as may be required to provide effective financial support for approved activities.

REPORT

SUEJECT: TPPIKER

TO: John E. Faker, Chief, FEB

4 April 1950

1. Eackground

a. The communist youth mass meeting planned for Berlin during the "hitsun holidays, 27, 25, and 29 Bay, has been and is the sulject of a major propaganda offensive by the Russians and by German communists. It has followed the characteristic Soviet pattern of creating confusion and tenseness on the part of the propaganda targets achieving this objective by alternating belligerent threats with peaceful platitudes. The threats have ranged from declarations that the communist youth would drive the Mestern imperialists out of Berlin to outright statements that they would seize the Western Berlin government and restore the city to a unified, peaceful capital of Germany. The peaceful declarations have stated that the demonstration of 500,000 boys and girls (from all over Germany, and from other countries) will chiefly take place in Eastera Berlin and will consist of rally-carching, sports events, fireworks, and huge peace meetings. Permission was requested by the FDJ, of Oberburger-meister Reuter, to march in a body to the Olympic Stadium (in the Fritish Sector) but Reuter briefly and emphatically refused.

b. Turee groups are officially dealing with the situation.

(1) The Ferlin Allied Komandatura

(2) A committee under Oburgermeister Reuter

(3) A special HICOG committea.

These groups have coordinated their plans and according, reasonable pre-cautions shout be taken to protect vital Installations in Fest Ferlin. The police force has been augmented and provided with riot equipment.

c. It is now estirated that it is not the intention of the communists to make a serious effort to drive the Western occupying forces out of Ferlin, or to seize the mest city government. Howover, their campaign has succeeded to this extent, that it is not known whether or not they will attempt an actual putsch, or if they will adopt a policy of opportunisa and probe-and-thrust at Test Ferlin défences with the determination to advence as far as they can; or if they will, in fact, confine themselves to meetings and demonstrations in East Eerlin. The possibility exists that their demonstrations may get out of hand or go beyond the intention of the impressarios of the show. Whether or not they attempt a coup d'etat, they assuredly will press every propaganda advantage.

d. The

d. The situation has been regarded as serious and potentially dangerous. Even as a propaganda triumph it might serve to strengthen communist drives all over Surope, especially in Gersany, and if there was any manifest weakness or temporising on the part of forces in Test Ferlin, the Deutschlandtrefien might serve as a springboard to huge wins.

## 2. Purpose of CPC olan

OrC operations against the Deutschlandtreffen are intended to oppose, harrass and attempt to turn to U.S. advantage the communist FDJ rally; also to render cooperation with other elements of resistance.. To achieve this purpose, it is contemplated that a number of propaganda and psychological warfare activities will be utilized; it may also be necessary to provide specific support for resistance groups prepared to. use physical violence to prevent FDJ demonstrations in West Ferlin.

## 3. Plans

Since January, the German Mission, OrC, has been planning a counter- attack. On 31 January, a field dispatch outlined steps to be taken and this has been amplified considerably in the last two months. At the present time, plans to neutralize or defeat the psychological and physical attack of the communists, contemplate the following:

a. Clandestine propaganda, distributed throughout East Germany, in advance of the Deutschlandtreffen, intended to break down desire to participate and exposing the militaristic and totalitarian character of the affair. Included:

a pastoral letter, addressed to all clergymen in the East Zone, entreating that young people he kept out of Ferlin during the FDJ rally, to prevent damage to their sculs and bodies;

spreading of rumors that large masses of young Germans are to be rounded up and shipped elsewhere for forced labor, and that numbers of them will be killed (with the murders charged to the Americans) in order to create martyrs for the cause;

special editions of Ferlin papers (distributed in East Ger- many) emphasizing the spectacle of Soviet Russia driving German youth into militarism.

b. Organized radio, press and other forms of publicity, during the Deutschlandtreffen, distributed throughout East Ferlin and East Germany, featuring positive achievements of the Test as contrasted to negative achievements of the East.

c. The staging of counter attractions, intended to reveal to large numbers of communist youth the better, unregizented life of Festern

Testern Germany as exemplified in West Ferlin. In connection with this campaign, the illumination of West Ferlin shops with display of luxury merchandise, special theatrical and movie attractions, sports events, possibly an automobile show.

d. Heutralization of possible communist propaganda claims of abuse and martyrdon, by discounting claims in advance and ridiculing the purpose.

e. Preparation to support groups of street fighters organized to resist attempts on the part of the FDJ to seize or damaمن installations in Test Eerlin and to meet any demonstration of force with greater force if high policy approves such defense operations.

f. A plan (subject of project PDQUICK) to hold, shortly after the Deutschlandtreffen, an Intellectual and Cultural Peace Congress in Berlin, bringing together a number of leaders of German, American, Eritish, Frenci, Russian, Czech, Italian, and other nationalities, representing high achievement and international reputation in fielis of labor, philosophy, politics, literature, art, music, education, and science. The Congress, held on the borderline between free and slave Europe, will concern itself with denouncing and exposing the swindle of communist peace propaganda, will beam its message to the satellite states to the effect that only intellectual and cultural slavery is possible in the Soviet system. Arrangements will be effected for broadcasting and publicizing the meetings of the Congress and a large distribution of its deliberations throughout East Germany and satellite Europe. Arrangements also will be made for worldwide publicity and follow-up. It is expected that the Congress will be self-perpetuating and will hold further meetings.

4. Headquarters action

Following dr. Lindsay's memorandum of 25 January and the field dis- patch of 31 January, headquarters action with reference to the Deutsch- landtreffen - and the Cultural Congress, as tied in has taken the following course:

(a) A conference was held in FE-III on 7 February at which the busic idea of PDQUICK was approved by représentatives of Staffs II and III, SADO, and PE-II. Fased on this approval a cable of authorization was sent to field the sane date.

(6) During February a committee was organized consisting of Lessrs. Glaser (Chairman), Chester, Droller, and Denky, to act as an expediting and coordinating group. At this date, the committee ns had two formal and a nunter of informal meetings. Members of the committee have also met twice with Dr. Hilger and four times with Er. Purnham.

(c) Arrangements


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 355

(c) Arrangements were completed to send a 'task force' to the field, consisting of two senior propaganda consultants and four junior assistants. At this date one of the juniors is on duty in Derlin, three others are ready to depart this week; the two senior consultants are expected to be in Berlin during this month.

(d) Approval of initial propaganda oportions, involving mailing of approximately 100,000 pieces to East Germany, was cabled.

(e) Various suggestions have been sent to the field, including recommendation that a complete documentary and photographic record be cade.

(f) A dossier of information, with reference to the Deutschlandtreffen, has been collected, including record of a State Department conference (by teletype) and summary of plans approved by the Allied Kommandatura.

(g) A project has been prepared (SGIIOUND) allotting $35,000 for emergency support of activities in connection with resistance to the Deutschlandtreffen.

(h) Discussions have been held, ideas formulated and support. research accomplished, most of this material held in suspense await-ing reports from the field as to current and planned requirements.

May?

JED: This idea sounded as though it might have/mischief-making potentialities; I have discussed it with Shub and Droller.

The last time a group of Germans mot before the Reichstag (which is 100 yards from the Soviet Sector of Berlin) was the 9th of September 1948 the occasion on which Reuter make his ringing declaration of defiance of the Russians, and ALSO defied the Western Powers, saying: "You cannot buy us ér sell us into slavery" by which he warned them not to make any deals with the Russians that would deliver Berlin to the communists. After that meeting, at which 23 woro shot, cho killed, the British Commandant denied the use of the Reichstag Platz for any future meetings. Gen. Bourne has changed his mind for the 1st of May, will permit a great anti-communist mass meeting (probably several hundred thousand people) which will again be addressed by Reuter. Anything can happen, because West Berlin police and West Allied troops will be on one side of the Brandenburg Thor facing East Berlin police and Russian troops on the other side. The 9th of September 1948 was historical, I have a hunch the 1st of Amil 1950 will be aiso.

Would that be a good time for Reuter to lay the foundation of establishment of the Reichstag as a 'House of European Peace?!' If it is, a cable along the following lines might be sent:

21 March

JEB: Spont an hour and a half this morning at the home of James Burnham; present - Burnham, Denby, myself and Col. Lansdalo from Chester's office.

COVER. Burnham says that the matter of his going over as attached In any way to McCloy was brought up because he wanted to have an opportunity to meet and talk with McCloy. In the meantime, licCloy came over here and Burnham saw him three times (we have one memorandum of conversation.) Ee added that cover has never boan a serious point with him, that he has travelled a number of times in various parts of the world pursuing his profession as a writer and lecturer, furnishing his own cover. The last time he went to Germany he was attached as consultant to ISD. He is willing to go over without any cover at all, or as consultant to Der Monat, if that seems indicatod, I told him I believed something like that was indicated as giving him a base of operation and rationalizing his contacts. Therefore, I shall prepare the momo, for Garland on the 'open' basis I had proviously suggested but with Der Monat in mind.

THING. Burnham is disturbed at the prospect of going to Europe For as long as sixty days and is quite reluctant to consider a longer period. This brought up the entire matter of the Congress and its juxtaposition to the FDJ Deutschland Treffen. All of us evidenced some despair over the fact that obviously we cannot mastermind either project without further advices from the field which seem to have been suspended.

The question was raised as to whether or not the Congress actually could be held in June, considering the kateness of the present dato. Burnham brought up for consideration the possibility of his going to Berlin about the first of May, or the last week in April, staying over the end of Lay, then returning to the United States on the theory that the Congress might not be hold until August or September. He proposed the 23rd of August (date of the Nazi-Russian pact) as an appropriate date. He then would start out again, presumably in the middle of August; in the meantime, he would establish contact with people in England, France and the US who might need pressure brought to bear upon them to attend the Congress,

If the Congress is to be held about the 20th of June, he suggests that he might go to Berlin about the middle of April, accomplish all he can in the way of advice as to the Deutschland Troffon, leave Forlin very early in Hay, travel through Franco and Engla land back to the US, building up acceptances for the Congress, roturning to Berlin on the 25th of May and staying over for the Congress.

CONSIDERATION OF REICHSTAG PROPOSAL.. He does not favor the idea of proposing the Reichstag building as a symbol of European Freedom,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 360

and thinks that the other European nations would shoor away from
the whole concept. He says that even to Germans the wretchod
building is only a symbol of the failure and fatility of the
Weimar Republic.

## LISTS.
Tie again went over lists of proposed delegates.

## BOLESLAW WIERZBIANSKI.
This gentleman has boon in Washington and
will be here again, Burnham thinks họ has been in touch with the
New York Committee. He is head of the International Federation
of Free Journalists of Eastern Europe and Baltic and Balkan
Countries, headquarters: 10 Stanhope Place, London 72. According
to Burnham the outfit represents 1200 journalists scattered over
Western Europe, the USA, Australia and South America. Thoy
are said to be publishing 170 papers of varying degrees of
-importance. Burnham says that the services of the organization
are being offered presumably for propaganda use and that
their first objective is to establish a New York office, for
operation and liaison, and that they need $42,000. Burnham
thinks someone here should explore the potential usefulness of
the group and I suggested that if they had been in contact
with the NY Committee they probably were being explored.

# REICHSTAG PROJECT

(To be broadcast over worldwide radio network in all languages in collaboration with Radio Free Europe, RIAS, the various European networks, BBC, CBS-NBC and the Voice of America).

## I) Purpose

To re-assert the universal fight for freedom in simple dramatic terms which men everywhere will understand.

## II) Occasion

Berlin
The opening session of the Cultural Freedom Congress, now scheduled for late June 1950.

## III) Sponsor

The Congress. Its executive body should include spokesman for all leading countries. Most specifically, it should include at least two outstanding Russians of world reputation and no minor ax to grind. The Russian nobel prize winning novelist Ivan Sumin (living in Paris, I believe), Igor Stravinsky, Serge Koussevitaky are names that suggest themselves. If the Congress itself includes a larger delegation from the leading European countries, then several Russian scholars and scientists now in U.S. or in DP camps should be included. All delegations, from countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, should be made up entirely of men of unimpeachable moral stature and real reputation. Professional politicians, even when they're good democrats, should be restricted to the rock-bottom minimum and must be of the moral stature of Mayor Ernst. Reuter of Berlin. Petty, self-seeking politics must be kept out. Would kill the whole show.

## IV) GENERAL STAGING AND PRODUCTION TECHNIQUE

The general treatment will flow from the moral and political tone of the production. The two are inseparable.

Sincerity and moral conviction must dominate the proceeding. Sincerity and moral must be treated as an organic whole: the rededication of a historic building into a House of European Freedom or House of Free Europe.

Why the Reichstag?

1. It stands on the precise frontier of two worlds, one


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 363

2

free, the other slave. It is within a few foot of the Soviet flag on
Brandenburg Gate and the warlike Soviet momorial within the Britheh
sostor. It is the most dramatic spot for a visible answer to thos
two symbols of despotion and force that exista anywhere in the world.
It is the only place to dedicato a palace of freedom which will be
clearly visible to soldiers and officers of the Soviet army.

2. The Roichstar cerned this redodicatión en September 9, 1948
   whs.1 300,00 Berliners flocked before its stops to defy the Kremilin
   during the grin days of the Borlin bloedcade.

S. It was not on fire by Hermann Goebing and Josef Goebbels, who
then presented the world Comamist novoment with undosorved martyrs and
hereos in the person of Dimitrov and his co-defendants. Its rebirth as
a nooting place for free men of all nations is a more than fitting
historical answer to the Rolchstar firo.

4. As long as the Reichstag stande in its present ruined condition
   it is a cancer feeding on the offended national pride of most Germans.
   This is particularly true because it is within sight of the strident Soviot
   var memorial. Even the best German denoorat cannot pass this building
   without being mad at most of the world. In the normal course of evente,
   the building would probably be restored for sone narrow German puгрове.
   By making it the Houseof Buropean Freedom wo killerds with one
   stone!

a) Wo give normal, healthy German and Berlin pride (as distinguished
fros ite wordid, rosantful and chauvinistic manifestations), a positive
outlet. This is reeducation through dramatic action instead of Sunday school.
moralising which registers with nobody. All Berlin will be tremendously
---and bealthfully---proud of itself on this day.

b) We strike a blow for freedom everywhere.

o) e deal an effective blow to resurgent German nationalism
in Western Germany and in the Soviet sone, by making both its forms seem
low, provintbal, stupid, ared bush leaqua compared to the Reichstag rising
like phoonix out of the ashes in the cause of European freedom.

d) to give West Deriin an engemous moralo boost and forcefully
rewind then that (1) Berlin is a great motropolis (*Weltstadt*) and (11)
that it rains part of the free world-in fact one of the prest bastions
of that fres world.

3) The Stage Sots

No attempt should be made to prottify the Reichstag for the
ceremony. Reconstruction will proceed later, with pernics collected from
people all over the world. (A topa limit should be placed on contributions
to prevent men of wealth and power from contributing more than simple
plain folks everywhere)...

At the unveiling, there should be temporary plaquos or
*nave*
plaster-cist bintex bas-reliefs of the Great Hon of Freedom who will
adorusd the building. Perhaps their names-dogo in big bold strokos


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 364

# 3

in the two leading alphabets of Europe (the Latin and Cyrillic)-
is enough for the opening ceremony. Two names fax and/or busts for
each country will suffice. A great quote from each could go with it.
Examples:

1.  France: Voltaire (I disagree with everything you say but will
    defend to the death your right to say it- words to that effect)
    Danton

2. Germany: Goethe
   Heine (There is a Heine quotation which Mayor Router
   (as the host of the Congress) could well use in his opening remarks. It
   would set the right tone for all that follows. If the Germans
   can be sold on this approach, it is the most devastating answer to
   nationalism, to the resurgent neo-fascist groups who are now flying
   the black white red of Imperial Germany. Heine's words
   offer to the Germans their only chance of return to greatness which
   the non-German world can ever respect. (Note that the black-red-gold
   is the present flag of West German public-without, however, the
   Freeden-loving European content that Heine wanted to give it.

3. Italy-- Garibaldi
   Massini (?)

4. If we want to include the U.S. despite the fact that this
   is house of European freedom, there are two great names that will sell
   without causing any negative reaction anywhere.

a) Jefferson (The most effective answer to the Communist
charge that we are reactionaries are his words on the revolutionary
right to overthrow a bad regime. I see no reason why the dictators of the
Kremlin and the NKVD should steal the revolution from the men of Loxing
ton and Concord, Valley Forge and th Declaration of Independenos. The
fact that a few lost souls in this country are afraid of Jefferson's s
great words, is also no reason not to use them.

b) Lincoln.

5. Russia: The Decembrists. These are the man who returned to
   Russia from the Napoleonic wars imbued with western ideas and attempted
   to challenge the Tsarist autocracy with a revolutionary democratic
   program. They were hanged in 1925. A famous plaque showing the profiles
   of the five leaders has been reproduced very widely in the Soviet Union
   and is known to practically every Russian school child. In fact, the
   Russians know everything about these men, except the ideas and ideals
   they represented. These have been carefully suppressed or rendered false
   through Soviet Newspeak. For the Reichstag unveiling, I'd have this
   plaque reproduced-large enough to be seen across the street in the
   Soviet sector. It should face the Soviet side of the street and have the
   word "DECEMBRISTS" in the Russian language as well as English, German,
   French.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 365

# 5. Russia (continued)

Vera Figner: A great Russian revolutionary and a militant fighter for freedom. Also a woman of extraordinary beauty and moral integrity. She was known in the Tsarist fortress prison where she spent most of her life, as the "Uhionka of the Schlusselburg."

When President Garfield was assassinated, Vera Figner and her prison comrades addressed an open letter of sympathy to the American people in which they condemned this act of terrorism. They said that the use of terror against the elected representative of the people was just as immoral and wrong as absolutism's use of terror against the Russian people. They explained that they were forced--against their will--to combat despotism with force, but intended to discontinue its use as soon as a representative democratic government existed in Russia.

Vera Figner lived to be liberated by the democratic revolution of March 1917. She delivered a great speech in a Petrograd theatre on the meaning of freedom, shortly after the fall of the Tsar. Because of her age and exceptional moral prestige in Russia, the Soviet government let her die in peace. Her name stands for all the noble ideals that the Soviet dictatorship seek to eradicate from the Russian conscience and consciousness. Yet her name as such--robbed of its moral content--is known to most Soviet Russians. Soviet textbooks never speak badly of her--nor do they tell her great story. Here is an opportunity to restore her name to the Russians --alon-side of the Decembrists. Would he difficult indeed to find a better symbol to stand together with such names as Danton, Jefferson, Garibaldi, Heine.

This is not dramatic corn; it is psychological warfare with atomic power. By restoring Vera Figner to the Russians, from the steps of the House of East European Freedom in Berlin, we start the chain reaction. Whether this becomes an atomic explosion of test-tube or of operative intensity, depends on how much is done on other fronts to win the Russian people. But clearly here', a way of reaching them (and the "them" includes high officers of the Soviet army and officials of the Soviet government as well as the rank-and-file) through a POSITIVE APPROACH to which they are acutely susceptible after over 30 years of spiritual and moral starvation.

# C) ACCOMPANYING MUSIC, THEATRE, ETC

1. Music for the Congress should be of two general categories (a) a special concert by the Berlin Philharmonic, if possible with an outstanding internationally conductor. She ideal would be Arturo Toscanini (he practically spit in Mussolini's eye). If Toscanini is not available, the next best would be Serge Koussevitzky or Max Isor Stravinsky. The reason is obvious. I think that of the German conductors, only Bruno Walter would be right for our broader moral purposes. To use Furtwaengler would be a mistake. If we did, we'd no longer be on the side of the angels. I think the Beethoven Ninth with its closing hymn on the brotherhood of man (Schiller's Ode to Joy) is just right. Could be proceeded by the Prometheus or Egmont Overtures, both of which are perfect in political content--and are exciting music to European ears as well. This concert could be given in a hall, broadcast and then portions of the tape recording could be used again at the Reichstag. The concert should precede the Reich stag ceremony.

b) More popular stuff, including the stirring folk songs and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 366

revolutionary music which neither Communism nor Nazism have polluted
(e.g. the Marsellaise, Sorbian chetnik songs, Brüder zur Sonne zur
Freiheit, whose Russian version was sung by generations of revolutionists
and illegal words of which are still disseminated today
among Soviet troops--I've seen an actual leaflet). These songs need
not be in the least provocative or an incitement to anything-except to
a deep feeling that freedom is one and indivisible. These songs can
be recorded in RIAS or Free Europe studios well in advance of
meeting, and can be piped over loudspeakers at Reichstag meeting, with
the crowds joining in. This technique was successfully used with the
last of the abovementioned songs at the Reich tag rally of
September 9, 1943. It is very simple and effective. Radio listeners
got the impression that several hundred thousand people are singing, if
the acoustics are handled right. No songs should be used to which exception
can be taken on the ground that it is aimed against any particular existing
regime. There is no reason to do so. The good
stuff applies by implication- and it is an implication which the adversary
cannot admit. Can only shut its ears.
The right use of music at the Reichstag is essential to
the success of the whole. It is a vital part of the over-all production. Its
importance for broadcasting purposes can scarcely be overestimated. Gives
the whole show the lift and the universal lilt that is needed.

V) THE POLITICAL LINE

1. Freedom is one and indivisible. It concerns all men everywhere.
   EVERYBODY DESERVES IT. THERE ARE NO CHOSEN PEOPLES, NATIONS OR CONTINENTS.
   THERE IS ONLY MAN.

2. This is NOT Europe defying Russia. On the contrary, it is Europe
   reaching out north, south, east and west to all its children, including
   the Russians, and summoning them in the great crusade which must go on
   until all are free. If the Soviet rulers want to turn their backs
   on Europe, that's their business. The Freedom Congress and Mayor
   of Berlin will assume that the Russians want very much to be a part
   and parcel of Free Europe. This is the only approach which divides the
   Politburo not only from the common people, but from a decisive segment
   of the upper party, intellectual and army command of Russia.

3. Free Europe Versus Slave Russia is the/road to
   World War III. Let's play away from this at all times

4. Free Europe, including the Russians, versus the Politburo
   and the Cominform, is the only way to make the Burnham thesis work--or
   at least give it a fighting chance. It is at last worth
   a good test run from the Reichstag steps in connection with this
   project. Involves no risk, except the use of a little imagination, and
   its cost is very slight indeed.

VI) SECURITY AND SURPRISE.

Most of the impact will be lost if the approach
leaks out through press conferences or other channels. There should
be no press conferences until the actual curtain goes up in Berlin. In
no event should the Russians be tipped off as to the approach. Let them


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 367

6

assume that the Congress intends to conduct a Europe versus Soviet Union Congress. Let then wear their propaganda accordingly. All their broadcasts, etc. with vituperation aimed at the wrong targets that will make this show doubly effective. Therefore, the working details should be made known to as few people as possible. The National Committee for Free Europe should assist in all technical preparations, furnish the necessary language announcers for broadcasts of the proceedings in the appropriate languages. But it is essential that the contents remain secret until the show goes on the air. This is not only security in the ordinary sense; it is also a matter of delivering the blow with maximum effect.

2. Adequate/guards should be posted at all broadcasting and transmitter facilities in Berlin. I am thinking particularly of the transmitter in the Brits section of Berlin, which is far too close to the Soviet line for comfort. While I am convinced that the Russians would make no attempt to start a disturbance at the Reichstag (If we take normal security precautions), I think they may well attempt to sabotage some of the radio installations. I would not trust any except proper American and/ or British public safety officers and guards to protect these.

Alternate transmitting and broadcasting units should be held in readiness in case of sabotage against Brits installations or elsewhere. I believe RIAS has two transmitters, but I dont know whether they are both in Brits or not.

3. The number of persons at the Berlin end to be informed of the project should be kept as small as possible and transmitted at last possible date consistent with an effective production job. Everything which can be recorded at the New York and should be taken along on unbreakable platters and put on German tape at the Berlin end when operation is in final phase. This is a simple matter. It is done regularly with 101 transcriptions sent to Germany.

4. No one in RIAS should know of this operation until final preparatory stage.

5. All policy considerations must be cleared in such fashion as to prevent any form of bureaucratic sabotage or buck-passing at the Berlin end of the operation.

6. One American, thoroughly familiar with the aims, large and small, of this project, should maintain close personal liaison with "Major Ernst Reuter of Berlin. That is in agreement with the general aims and objectives formulated above--and that he is precisely the man to present these aims in terms which all Berliners, decent Germans, and the rest of the world will understand and admire, I know is the case. He is the perfect host and master of ceremonies. He speaks German, English, French, Russian, Turkish --and believes that freedom is indivisible.

Please excuse excess wordage.

ADDENDUM: AFTER THE CONGRESS IS OVER

On pp. 1-6 supra, I indicated the general lines that would make the Reichstag dedication as a House of European Freedom effective. This ceremony, together with the other events of the *ad hoc* Berlin cultural Congress of June 1950, will be broadcast--as indicated supra--over a world-wide network. That is the dramatic spectacle where everything worth saying on the subject of freedom and the dignity of man will be compressed into a few poor days. (Another event might during Congress week could be a special performance of Buechner's play *Dantons Tod* at the Hebbel Theatre. If possible get Vladimir Sokoloff from Hollywood for the Robespierre role. He did it for Max Reinhardt. I trust he's still alive). Assuming that the show is a success, that only discharges half the mission. The other half is to gradually build up the Reichstag structure, stone by stone, in line with the political and moral ideals indicated above. The Reichstag as House of European Freedom.

THE HOUSE OF EUROPEAN FREEDOM (or Free Europe).

1.  The general spirit has already been indicated above. The great names and words should be presented in simple dramatic terms, designed by an artist with the talent and moral fibre to understand what this is all about. The aesthetic problem is a rather tricky one. The Reichstag is hardly the most beautiful structure in the world, yet it would be a mistake to depart from its basic style in the course of reconstruction. To reconcile these two problems--the greatness of simplicity, with the stuffiness of the existing structure, is a problem for some contemporary Michelangelo or a pint-sized version of same, to solve. It can be done.

The exterior should not contain more than a dozen or so names of the calibre indicated on pp 2-4 supra: Jefferson, Danton, Voltaire, Vera Figner, Garibaldi). But we should never lose sight of one objective without which the rest is largely wasted efforts the Russians. If we leave them out, the whole thing is a boomerang and nothing more, which will undermime and counter furnish grist for the anti-American, anti-western propaganda mill. It is also essential that the Russian names and busts or bas reliefs face the Russian side of the city--where the Russians can gaze on them with wonder and admiration--end go home to think about the meaning of things in the present world.

Inside the building, there could be an international hall of fame--in the same spirit -- selected by peoples throughout the world. Here we could have the great scientists, writers, philosophers, etc. of Europe and perhaps the rest of the world, placed in simple niches. The busts should avoid the hollow heroic style that the Nazis and Soviets perfected. They should do in exactly the opposite spirit, presenting the great as they were--human beings with all the weaknesses and contradictions of the human race. The sculptors or sculptors for this job should be selected by an international board, including French, German, Russian, Italian, etc experts who are fully cognizant of the spirit of the thing.

2.  Substantial Contributions should come from people all over the world, with the emphasis on pennies not dollars. The longer it takes to complete the job--within limits of course--the better for political purposes. Enough if one segment is finished soon fairly soon, with an auditorium and/or exhibition hall. The prolonged fund-raising drive will supply Radio Free Europe, the Voice of America, BBC and lots of other agencies with a steady flow of good, positive copy with the theme


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 369

of freedom running through it all the time. Contributions coming from DPs individually, and from special fund- raising events in DP corps, would have an obvious dramatic value.

5. As the structure begins to become usable, it should feature all the type activities that make Europe and European civilization worth saving. The emphasis should be on things of lasting value rather than refrigerators, Coca Cola and such. In other words, the best in European films-whether these be French, German, Italian, etc. Some of the old Soviet films, since withdrawl from circulation because they dont fit to the time, should also be shown. The best (repeat best) in American pictures could also be shown. By best is meant that which the Europeans would respect for its artistic or spiritual content, not those which make the most money-they can be seen elsewhere in Berlin.

Exhibitions of painting, lectures on current trends in literature, lectures in political science, history and contemporary politics, by outstanding artists, scholars, etc., should be part of the feature of the use of European Freedom, insofar as possible. The building should include a library, and even if it isnt very large, it should include the Great Books in the leading languages, as well as current periodicals, etc to keep the intellectuals of Berlin-and any other civilians-on their toes. There is no such library in Berlin today.

Symposia, Town-Hall-Meeting of the ‘air, etc events should could also be held here from time to time. The important thing is to keep the whole building, its reconstruction, and the events it presents, as close to the spirit of the opening ceremonies as possible.

4. All of the above is far simpler than it sounds. Europeans love to be given such projects. And I rather suspect that Americans could take to it too, if the broadcast account of the Congress proceedings properly presents the issue to them.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CEE

ATTN: Mr. Garland

SUBJECT: James Burnham

REFERENCE: Project POBJICE

1. The project is a proposal to hold an Intellectual and Cultural Congress in Berlin, Germany, to be sponsored by leading German Intellectuals, notably Dr. Nololob of the Free University of Berlin. The object is to establish a base of freedom in political, cultural and social thought, established where it may serve as a springboard for propaganda infiltration into the Iron Curtain countries including East Germany. At the same time, and various events of even greater importance, the Congress will be held either immediately preceding or immediately following the Communist Youth Rally to be held in Berlin the last three days of May - serving to offset considerably the influence of the Communist rally and as a basis for counter propaganda and counter action.

2. The Berlin ORD field office has urged the sending of two propaganda experts to the field as special consultants. James Burnham fits the requirement, is under contract, and we have proposed in a cablegram to send him during the month of April for a period of from 30 to 60 days. While in the field he will serve in approximately the same capacity and perform the same functions as when on duty in Washington. The second propaganda expert is a staff employee.

Reference is made to your memorandus dated 15 February 1950 concern-
ing the subject.

This memorandum requested change in status for the subject from an operational clearance to that of a covert consultant for the purposes as outlined in the memorandum of 16 February 1950.

In accordance with the provisions set forth in the Director's menor- andum of. 14 February 1949, entitled "Security and Operational Clearances", a covert security clearance as requested in the memorandum of 15 February 1950 is granted for the use of the subject.

This covert clearance as granted does not always constitute complete compliance with the provisions of Al 10-2. Therefore, if you should desire at a later date to change the status or use of this individual, please advise Inspection and Security sufficiently in advance so that no delay is caused in the transition.

This Office would further appreciate being advised when the contem- plated use as set forth in your memorandum of 15 February 1950 for the sub- ject has been completed, so that the files of this Office may be kept up to date.

MEMORANDUM TO: CPB 11

SUBJECT: Meeting with Kenneth 3. HAMBLEY and Messrs. Williams, Droller, Glaser, and Stitch re Berlin. Conference

1. Direct action is imperative in Berlin.

a. Organize groups to beat the Commie opposition in street fighting.

b. Carry the counterattack into the Soviet Sector.

c. It is not undesirable to have Soviet's fire on German citizens.

2. Fighting, against the background of the Peace Conference, with the general populatice and the conference, participants in the streets, would have tremendous and desirable effect.

a. To be beaten in the streets would be defeat complete.

b. A fight is important. A successful fight is imperative. It would cause good publicity, instill confidence in the Berlin population and insure major victories for our side.

c. If no Commie fighting group plans to start the fight, create one and beat it up.

3. A head-on challenge - rioting and perhaps shooting - is inherent in the streets as it is now conceived.

4. HAMBLEY thinks that the Soviet authorities plan control of the streets.

5. What would mass effect be of a background of American tanks?

a. If it is necessary to prevent defeat - do it.

b. It would be far better, however, to have force exercised by the Berlin population with no Azerican military force in sight.

Suggestions for Mr. Baker

Re: Project Memorandum No. 35.

1. I would suggest that the foliowing person and organizations be invited to attend and participate in the May meeting:

a. Dr. Reinhold NIEBUHR (USA) presently at the Union Theological School, Columbia University he is a member of the Commission on the Occupied Areas and past chairman of the General Committee of world Student Service Fund.

b. International Student Service (ISS) an outstanding international cultural exchange medium of the university community (ie. both professors and students are included) with headquarters in Geneva. This organization was formed after the first world war and in addition to its conference and tour activities it has been primarily responsible for the relief work done throughout the world in the colleges and universities. This organization is the most prominent existing opponent of the International Union of Students (IUS) in which the FDJ holds membership.

c. World Assembly of Youth (WAY) organized recently (1948) in London this is an international youth organization formed to counter the influence and activities of the world Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) The WFDY is communist dominated and controlled. The FDJ is a member of the WFDY.

2. with reference to the Project Memorandum dated 31 January 1950.

6. a. The facilities of the world Radio University (WRUL) a non-governmental short-wave radio station in NYC and Boston might be used in connection with pre-publicizing the May meeting. USA participants could be interviewed and the day-to-day activities of the meeting presented via the air waves.

b. c.d. This should be encouraged.

8. d. An anonymous publication of COLLOQUIUM might be useful here. This student magazine at the University of Berlin (as opposed to the Free University) prior to april 1948 acted as a spokesman of the student opposition to the Soviet.

9. why are we apprehensive? Is there a possibility that the west German youth would follow the cp line?

11. Considering (9) in the light of (11) I would think that it would serve US interests to fly into Berlin students now in the western zones who have fled their former eastern German nomes. These students, oriented towards the hest, signt best serve our propaganda interests. Dialect speaking to dialect, etc.

Conference at home of Jim Burnham (Williams, Droller, Smith, Burnham, Glaser.

At this meeting Mr. Burnham, in response to questions, stated his enthusiasm for the idea. He proposed that Sidney Hook be sent over to Germany for a few weeks on an exploratory mission and to render what assistance he may in connection with planning. He expressed his willingness to go over to Berlin sometime in advance of the congress (under cover of an invitation he has received from the Free University) to actively assist in planning the agenda and other details. He is making up a list of proposed delegates to be invited; thinks it important someone from S.America be included. He is particularly opposed to the inclusion of Sarto in the list of delegates; is not sure of Plievier but not opposed. Arrangements made to continue conferring, probably next week.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 402

see Baudouin with some of this question.

1. The whole question of the title of the Congress has been giving him some concern. Held at any other time than in immediate juxtaposition to the Communist Youth Rally, it would be OK. Hold at that time it is inevitably going to be regarded as a counter attack and in those terms a 'Congress of Culture' is not adequate. He wants to broaden the base - perhaps label it a political Congress. (by own idea, at the moment, is opposed to a political label; but I agree that a Congress for Intellectual Freedom - which could take in political aspects - might be better than restricting it to culture.)

2. He suggests June as a date - unless we can turn out this affair in a BIG and SIGNIFICANT enough fashion to really offset the communist convention. I don't know his arguments for June but I can imagine that they would take the line that instead of being lost in the world wide attention and publicity for the communist deal, it would come as the last shot, after the communists had exposed themselves as slaves of Moscow, and might make a ringing effect. Also June would be the right time for college people to get away from their universities, might be very difficult in May.

3. He is anxious to have labor represented and suggested a big representation from labor groups, including Dubinsky. Also certain leading political figures.

Am. Ex. will accept money (check, draft or cash) in one place N.Y. office - or in several places (Paris, for instance) provided one central office knows details and can coordinate.

Will then write to all offices involved, authorizing transportation, etc., for list of persons (which may be added to at last moment). We specify what credentials persons must present. We also specify whether transportation is to be by air, steamship, rail, etc.; first class or otherwise; whether or not expenses are to be allowed in this connection they suggest that travelling expenses be allowed (for meals, etc.) not to exceed 10% of transportation. They suggest that we act as soon as practicable because of rush for travel to Europe but Lr. Gilmore says they can be reasonable cortain of providing air transportation.

They will render a complete accounting of transportation and expense money provided, and remit unexpended balances.

Samples of material so far issued.

They are working on the matter of satellite repressatation. Examples: Ceidrovich and Chapski from Poland; Porutka fron Czechoslovakia; Hocolievsky and Yakofleff from Russia. Several others.

Eleanor Roosevelt had accepted, but after appearance of NY Times story she was seen by a reporter and was said to have stated that she had changed her mind. Hook is also doubtful because of his commitment to U of Cal. However, a personal letter is going to these three, from McCloy, urgently asking them to attend. Eelen Douglas! and Robt. Kontgomery are both regarded as excellent prospects.

Skeggs expressed dim view of Buttles' activities and is anxious US interest and US releases be played down. However, he is anxious that there should be great deal of publicity as time approaches. Furthermore, I got impression that he had inspired Buttles, to some extent at least, to take the action in approaching Hook. For instance, Skeggs is anricus that we consider suggestion that about the 1st or 2nd of June an advertisement appear in NY Times and Wash, Post, signed by large number of organizations and persons, calling attention to Congress. He suggested this could be organized by Sidney Hook which gave me idea that he may have suggested some such activity to Buttles, which may have resulted in Buttles' trip.

Details in Berlin are being crefully worked out. Delegates will stop either at the Steinplatz or Amzoo hotel - obvicus reasons for having them all together. They will have official taxis for their use, corridors and entrances will be guarded by plain clothes German and US personnel, some of them will be inconspicuously guarded personally. Meeting place Taberna Academica - will be well guarded.

Matter of interpreters being worked upon, repert later.

There will be press delegates from all countries, in addition radio RIAS will tape the entire proceedings and will furnishi cuttings to individual radio stations, for instance - if the Vienna radio wants the speech of one of the Austrian dalogates, it can be provided. Rias also will be on air with reports of proceedings, but they may need some pressure later on.

He will doler the $200 to Hook and thinks that will be sufficient. He and Hook and Burnham will try to work out methods of definitely signing up certain doubtful prospects. He will roport to Marian Saunders and when he comes to Washington, to Kollerman. on my advice, ho will play it straight with both - as though he had no contact with us, says ho will listen rathor than talk, but I regard that as impossiblo. Will assure State that overything is going well, is completely in hands of comitboo and that all action should sten from Berlin in order to have contral control and full coordination,

Was delighted at plans for financing travel of delegatos.

than $40,000, but that an allocation of $50,000 should be
made to insure fully adequate financial support:

c. That approval of the French and British High Com-
missioners for Germany should be obtained to insure tri-partite
support of the Congress, and that French and British material
aid should be forthcoming, at least to the extent of pro-
viding transportation for delegates from their countries.

3. It was agreed also that an effort should be made to
   arrange the attendance at the congress of representative refugee
   intellectuals from curtain countries, but that these should not

include members of the various national committees.

4. The question of using NYLON funds for this project was not discussed, but will be considered in due course.

Memo by L.G.: Kroller could be of extreme value, not as contributing anything substantive to the Congress (which he is qualified to do, and which would not be necessary) but because the follow-up will call for intensive PW planning - and securing and hearing the Congress and discussions will benefit proper men there, which would make P3II follow ups much, much more efficient and effective.

What started out to si heap was thpt
of the general idla
gasts of the genisa
of a Cristo ty, he is Sity mp of
February 1950
MEMORANDUM FOR Mr. Baker hure Glen hilik the

1. I first heard of thisyou spr of a de-briefing Huth Fischer,
   which took place accut three months ago. I first tock a hegative view of
   the proposal, which seemed to be in danger of loose and ineffective han-
   dling; however, I have an entirely different opinion of such a conference
   as outlined by Jesselson and under his guidance. It could, if very well
   handled, furnish an opportunity for creation of morale, basis for propa-
   ganda and a spring-bcard for continuing effort.

2. Berlin est only is the obvious place for the conference, it is
   the only place wh.re the impact could immediately be feit ir Satellite
   countries. (Berlin radio, press and personal contact with East Germany,
   Foland and Czechoslovakia.)

3. Should the sponsoring committee include a woman? Fossibly louise
   Schroeder of Frau von Bahn-arnack or Jeanette wolf? I also suggest Karl
   Arnold. And would like you to consider the inclusion of a known anti-n
   Soviet intellectual who also is anti-u.5.

4. I think the budget should be expanied to cover the possibility that
   the City of Berlin say not, or perhaps should not, provide the various halls
   ani opera houses free of charge; also a "convention in Germany involves
   more flowers, and music (usually a 100-piece symphony orchestra) than a
   Vanderbilt Wedding. I think the over-all Berlin expense of 1 10,000 should
   have a reserve of at least an additional 120,000

5. I think this proposal should, in the interest of speed, be imple-
   mented as follows:

a. & conference of representatives of CCF, CFF, SAC for cuick 10.
(24-hour) agreement in principle, so that a cable may be sent to the
field.

b. Freparation of a roject Flan and procurerent of special
assistants.

c. Freparation of a subsidiary propaganda plan to insure
adequate reporting of the conference and adequate circulation of its
deliberations, in several languages, behind the curtain.......

6. Even with the method proposed in paragrach 5, unless a cable of
   basic approval can go out of here before the 9th of February and the Project
   can be prepared, cocriirated and fully approved prior to 21 February,- I
   do not believe we can count on the ning suggested by Like which, inci-
   dentally, is excellent coming as it does prior to the big presumptive explo-
   sions of 1 Kay and the Commune uth Conference. I, therefore, propose
   that the suggestion in 5 (a)ed on é Februay.

MEMORANDUM TO: BAKER
MILLER
HARRISON
BRYAN

SUBJECT: Berlin Intellectual Conference

1. A proposal for the support of an Intellectuals' Conference in Berlin has been pouched in by Gearing. He asks that this be given urgent consideration and that a decision should be made as quickly as possible. If the operation is undertaken, Josselson wili need the assistance of two or three people in Berlin. Those people might be the same as those mentioned in relation to the Communist Youth meeting in Berlin this Spring.

2. Arrangements for the organization of a political and psycho- logical coordinating group in HICOG have been completed and are awaiting McCloy's approval. The purpose of this group is to coordinate the activities of the various staff sections in McCloy's office in these fields, and to develop a more intensive program of action.

3. Gearing will sit as a member of the Committee representing SHUTE. This will give him the opportunity of being acquainted with all overt action planned in Germany so that covert operations can be properly coordinated with them.

January 11, 1950.

Your letter of December 29 was late in arriving and I am replying by hand to save delay.

(a) The idea of a "MORAL" Congress is an excellent one! But should it be a "MORAL" Congress or something undertaken under the auspices of a non-government, especially a non-occupying government group. Perhaps the Free University can be nominal sponsor or some Europeen Fed for Cultural Freedom ed hoc.

(b) Spring is too soon to organize such a conference properly. Suggest lete summer or fall.

(c) To be effective conference must be tied in with some concrete issue of a cultural character in which all delegates con agree despite their difference on other things. What specific issue positive or negative is shaping up in Germany today in which leading intellectuals can take s position? The differences among the participants, if not as great as at Peris, will certainly be considerable, and this is not at all a bad thing if things don't end up as they did in Paris. The main thing, however, is to see that there is at least one major practical issue on which everyone can agree independently of differences in fighting Stalinism.

(d) I assume you can arrence to cover expenses for Reise and Unterkunft of ell delocates..

(e) Suggest the following de united from this count:
Edmund Hilson, Dos Passos, Sinclair Lewis, Upton sinclair,
Faulkner, Reinhole Nierunr, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Philip Pahy.
Willien Phillips, Lionel Trilling, Farrell, perhaps me. If you can get 5 am the U.S. to and it would be enough.

(f) Koestler was planning something similar to this. My surjestion woulibe to get in touch with him at once to see whether anything has come of his plans. He would also be a good man to draft the statement of the cell which should be signed by one person from England (Comille or Russell), Frence, Netherland, Germany, Italy, Belgium and US, perhaps some Spanish extio.

The suggestion to set up an International Committee for Cultural Freedom may serve as the least common denominate of the various interests. Careful proportion, of course, is necessary but if you can get 50 to 60 people together or outstanding artists, we can do the trick.

In conclusion, stating is important and the few people in this part of the world can get away the

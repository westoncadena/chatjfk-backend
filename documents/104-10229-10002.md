   THE ACCOUNT SHOWING THE AMOUNT IN THE BANK WHICH IS SHOUN
   IN PARAGRAPH I B.ABOVE, THE AMOUNT PAID TO THE ORIGINAL TRUSTEE
   WHICH IS $2,925.00 AND THE AMOUNT DUE MRS. CLARA MOLINA.
   SINCE MRS. MOLINA'S HUSBAND DIED PRIOR TO AMT IKI-1 TAKING

AMTRIGON-8 (201-283995), AMBUD Case #97

Reference: UFGW-7040, 29 April 1968

1.  AMTRIGON-8 was a member of the VILLARO crew. During May 1962 he clandestinely and without authorization boarded an infiltration craft moments before its departure on an operational mission. His absence was not discovered until the team had infiltrated and moved into its first position.

2.  On 8 or 9 June 1962 the infiltration team, including AMTRIGON-8, became engaged in a firefight with a militia patrol. AMTRIGON-2, the team leader, reported that AMTRIGON-8 had been wounded and that he assumed AMTRIGON-8 was killed or perhaps captured. However, no further word has been heard from AMTRIGON-8 and he is presumed to be dead.

3.  Taking into consideration that the disposition of this case could have an affect on the morale of the other crew members and their attitude toward WOFIRM, it was decided to advise the widow of AMTRIGON-8 that he died a hero's death--while fighting for the liberation of his country and to continue monthly payments to the widow and children for an indefinite period. Inclusion of Subject's name on AMBUD Hero & Martyr rolls was deemed to be the most suitable and expeditious manner in which to handle such payments.

4.  The response to paragraph 2 of reference will be the subject of a separate dispatch.

AMBUD Trust Accounts

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES: FYI

Reference: UFGW-7020, 11 April 1968

1. ANTIKI-1 has advised that he does not envisage any problems in closing out the trust accounts. However, since the bank holding the deposits is relatively small, it was agreed to accomplish the closing out of accounts over a period of several months. To this end, the accounts pertaining to cases #116 (Justo MONTES DE OCA Ceballos) and #114 (Francisco FERNANDEZ Cabrera) have already been closed out and the funds will be transferred to Headquarters in the near future.

2. Being forwarded under separate cover is the background information on the ten trust accounts as requested in reference.

SUBJECT TYPIC/Operational/AMBUD

Request for Additional Information on Two AMBUD Dependency Cases

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required: See Paragraph 1

1. It is requested that Raymond K. PANUSES rocheck the file of Miguel Los Santos DELGADO Martinez (Case No. 97) in an effort to determine the cause and actual date of his death. Headquarters file does not reflect this information nor the reason why his dependents are paid under the AMBUD program. In those few coses of former active assets whose dependents are paid by AMTIKI, the exact date and circumstance of death is necessary for documentation.

2. It is also requested that ANTIKI be queried regarding certain vital documents which should be in the file of Benito BLANCO Cruz (Case No. 3). A copy of a letter from the widow, dated 11 January 1962, indicated that her marriage certificate and the birth cortificates of her children were enclosed with the letter. It is possible, but unlikely, these documents were over- looked when the file was recently reviewed. In any event, the work chock sheet used by the documentation team indicates these documents were missing from the file.

Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

FROM:
Chief of Station, JMWAVE F.J..

SUBJECT:
TYPIC/AMBUD/Operational
Adjustment of Dependency Payments - Third Quarter FY 1968

1. The following financial adjustments to AMBUD
   dependency cases were made during the period covered by
   this report:

Caso #90: Guillermo GUIM Gutierrez (no 201 nr.)
Payee: Horminia CANTERO (widow)

Effective 1 March 1968 the monthly payment
for this case was reduced to $225.00 inasmuch as
the son, Guillermo GUIM Cantoro, reached 21 years
of ago.

Case #42: Ramon MOREJON Hernandez (201-289511)
Payee: Carmelina AENELLE (grandmother)

The payee's daughter returned the January 1968
payment to AMTIKI-1 with a note advising that the
payee passed away in December 1967. Since the
payee was the sole dependent designated by the
Subject, no further payments will be made in
connection with this case.

2. Subsistence payments made to Rafael ORTEGA Hernandez
   (201-299101), AMBUD medical case, were terminated with the
   January 1968 payment. ORTEGA was advised that this would not
   affect medical treatment expenses and that medical expenses
   will continue to be paid as in the past until further notice.

3. Per Headquarters instructions, the monthly payment to
   the Brigade office was reduced from $800.00 to $500.00

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

FROM: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: TYPIC/AMBUD

C AHELD Trustee Accounts

ACTION REQUIRED: REFERENCES

Reference: UFGT-21580, dated 25 March 1968

1. Headquarters recommends that all reference accounts, with the possible exception of the PASTRANA account (Case #118), be closed immediately and the proceeds transferred to Headquarters.

2. It is suggested that AMTIKI be queried concerning any possible embarrassment he might suffer in his personal relationship with the bank if he summarily closes all the accounts, since there is no wish to place him in an untenable position. Headquarters is aware that these so-called trust accounts are actually savings accounts and wore so designated on the 1967 bank statements filed in the AMTIKI files. Under the circumstances, it is highly possible that an IRS inquiry may be initiated after the accounts are withdrawn and AMTIKI should be assured of Headquarters intercession in his behalf if he is questioned by IRS. However, in the event of such an inquiry, Headquarters must be prepared to submit a full accounting of those cases including dates and amounts of deposits and withdrawals and WOFIRM authorization for transactions which JMWAVE should be able to provide. It is recommended that ANTIKI immediately prepare a full background history relating to the opening of each account, all financial transactions since the accounts were opened, and references to JMWAVE authorization for any deposits and withdrawals. These accountings should be forwarded for Headquarters files as soon as they are completed. When ANTIKI is authorized to close the accounts, a memorandum covering the authorization should be prepared by JMWAVE and a copy forwarded to Headquarters.

3. In the event above recommendations tend to create any insurmountable problems JMWAVE, is requested to advise the nature of the problems and submit alternate recommendations.

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: TYPIC/AMBUD/Operational AMBUD Dependency Case #64, Ovidio CAMEJO Lopez

ACTION REQUIRED/REFERENCE: FYI

1.  The monthly payment made to the dependents of Ovidio CAMEJO Lopez was reduced by $25.00 effective 1 April 1968 inasmuch as Station and AMTIKI-1 files indicated that Subject's son, Miguel Angel CAMEJO Rojas, had reached 21 years of age on 11 March 1968.

2.  Upon being informed of the payment reduction, Subject's widow, Blanca ROJAS, advised ANTIKI-1 by letter that the correct birth date of her son is 11 March 1948 and not 11 March 1947.. Subsequently, the widow provided a photostatic copy of her son's INS-issued residence card (copy attached) which records his birth date as 11 March 1948.

3.  Accordingly, ANTIKI-1 has been instructed to reinstate the $25.00 sum retroactive to 1 April 1968.

PROCESSING
MARKED FOR INDEXING

1.  AMTIKI-1 has contacted the bank regarding the Social Security numbers requested and has been advised that, although the bank is not obligated to insist upon Social Security or other identifying numbers for these accounts, it does feel that ANTIKI-1 may ultimately be subjected to an inquiry from the Internal Revenue Service. Their reasoning is based primarily upon the fact that the accounts, while trust accounts for our purposes, are not true trust accounts in that no trust agreements are of record at the bank. (Trust agreements could not be signed, of course, since the individuals were not and are not available to sign.)

2.  In order to protect AMTIKI-1 from any possible IRS investigation and, rather than pursue the matter further with the bank, for which we have no cleared contact, it is suggested that these accounts be closed out over a two or three month period and re-éstablished at Headquarters through the appropriate DTEARN channels. If the accounts remain here, it will be necessary to prepare new signature cards for each account removing Humphrey 0. TIMANUS as a signatory and adding a JMCOBRA asset as an "inside" trustee for control purposes, or to remove ANTIKI-1 entirely and establish the JMCOBRA asset as the sole trustee.

3.  Please advise.

IN THE EVENT BEC AGREES TO HANDLE THESE PAYMENTS, EACH DEPENDENCY CASE MUST BE DOCUMENTED BY BEC TO DETERMINE IF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED QUALIFY FOR COMPENSATION UNDER BEC CRITERIA.

2. ACCORDING TO PARAGRAPH 4 /B/ OF REFERENCE, THE AMACTION FILES ARE THOSE ORIGINALLY PREPARED BY APOTIN/1 WHICH WERE TURNED OVER TO AMACTION BY AMTIKI. IT SHOULD BE DETERMINED IF SUBJECT FILES CONTAIN ANY VITAL DOCUMENTS SUCH AS MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES, BIRTH CERTIFICATES, ETC., AND PERSONALITY DATA ON AMBUD DEPENDENTS, WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL IN DOCUMENTING THESE CASES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE AMACTION FILES ARE MERELY DUPLICATES OF THOSE HELD BY AMTIKI. HEADQUARTERS CONSIDERS IT PREFERABLE AT THIS TIME TO EXPLORE THE CONTENTS OF THESE FILES THROUGH AMOTIN/1.

Union City, N.J. 07087

January 25th, 1968

In the name of the Mothers, wives and sons Pig's Day nine Prisio-noro, I beg you to make your biggest effort to get in touch with the Commission or Department in ere, to confectionate the list of names in the possible trading between Presidente Bar-rientos of Bolivia and Fidel Castro of Cuba in order they include the names of the 9 Prisioners Pig's Day Invasion left in Cuba on the 1962 Trading because at that opportunity Castro did not want to trade them. As you know on this trading are involved prisio-noro alonging to the N.Y. Department and others: that the Pentagon can include in the Trading's List.

I know always the CIA Department, the Pentagon and the Government of the United States of America have their names in mind, of course they want to bring these nine Prisioners to freedom, in this oppor-tunity there is a very good chance, because Castro agreed with Fra-dante Barrientos to change all Comandante Prisioners and the Body of Ernesto (Che) Guevara for the Prisioners he has in Cuba that will be stated on the Trading's List.

We are sure you will do your best in order to include the nine Pig's Day Prisioners left on Cuba on the 1962 in the Trading's List. Please let me know something about it. Also we are enclosed copy of the letter we are sending to Senator Robert F. Kennedy ask-ing the same thing.

Thank you very much in advance for your attention in this matter,
I remain,

Very truly yours,

Senator:

As President of the Mothers, Wives and Sons of the 9 Prisioners Pig's Day Association, beg to you and pray to God, it could be possible for you to do something in this particular case. I don't want to make a long letter, because I know how busy you are, but this is a very good opportunity to bring home my husband RICARDO MONTERO DUQUE, and the others 8 prisioners left on Cuba on the 1962 trading. At that time when all others prisioners belonging to Pig's Day Invasion came in trading, Castro did not want to include them in the list.

The last timo I tried to be in touch with you, was on the 1964 at your Office, in this opportunity you were out the City, but your Secretary Mr. Nolan was very nice with us, and he told us ho was sure you were going to do everything possible to bring thom home, it was impossible and they stay at CUBA.

Now, you know there is a possible trading of prisioners between Presidente Barrientos of Bolivia and Fidel Castro of Cuba, in it are involved pricioners belonging to the CIA Department and others that the Pentagon can include in the Trading's List. We are sure you will not hesitate to do anything to bring them home, but it is our obligation and duty to try for their freedom.

The possible trading between Presidente Barrientos and Castro is because Castro wants all Communist Prisioners and the Body of Ernesto ( Che ) Guevara now in Bolivia; that's why he agree to accept all names that the CIA Department, Pentagon and Presidente Barrientos put in the Trading's List.

At the same time I'm writting a letter to the CIA Department from which you will find an attached copy. Please let me know anything about this and of course if this letter got your hands.

Thank you very much in advance for your attention in this matter, I remain,

Very truly yours,

FROM:
Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT:
Query Regarding Termination of Dependency Payments (Case #89)

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Action Required: See para 3.

1.  AMTIKI-1 received a letter dated 19 September 1967 from a lawyer representing Miguelena Teurbe FRITZ requesting information as to why "payments to the specifically named beneficiaries in your policy if you have one, or those who would normally receive the proceeds of a death benefit if you do not have a policy" had been terminated.

2.  A review of this caso reveals the following:

a. Miguelona Teurbe FRITZ was advised by a letter dated 31 December 1966 that it had been ascertained that she was not entitled to monthly payments as the widow of Roberto PEREZ Cruzata since she had never married PEREZ. The letter also advised that payments heretofore sent to Mrs. FRITZ for her daughter and the parents of PEREZ were likewise being terminated because it had been learned that her daughter, Kathleen FRITZ, is not related to PEREZ in any manner, that the mother had died, and that there is not evidence that the father in Cuba had received any of the funds intended for him.

b. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. FRITZ requested that the matter be reconsidered since she had not been given advance notice of the termination and because the abrupt halt in payments created a severe economic hardship for her.

c. She was then advised by letter that the payment enclosed with the termination notice was for January 1967 and was intended to provide a one-month notice of the payment termination.

She was also informed that in view of the apparent hardship resulting from her misunderstanding of the procedures, a gratuity payment of $275.00 was enclosed and that no further payments will be made.

3. The Station proposes sending a letter to the lawyer advising him that the assistance in question was in the nature of a gratuity and was in no way based on a contract of insurange and that when it was learned that Mrs. FRITZ was not PEREZ' widow it became necessary to discontinue the payments. Attached herowith is a copy of the proposed draft response, which was coordinated with Louis K. STORSELL from OGC while on TDY at JMWAVE. Prompt Headquarters concurrence is requested.

Re: Miguelina Teurbe Fritz

Dear Mr. Avant,

Please be advised that I have been requested by Mrs. Miguelina Fritz, to write to you, with respect to her insurance benefits by reason of the death of Roberto Perez Cruzata.

I have in my possession copies of your letter to Mrs. Fritz, dated January 31, 1967, and a letter to her from John L. McKercher, of your office, dated December 31, 1966.

I am interested in knowing your reasons for not paying the specifically named beneficiaries in your policy if you have one, or those who would normally receive the proceeds of a death benefit if you do not have a formal policy.

There is no doubt that the decedent must have wished that any proceeds be paid as he directed, and before proceeding in this matter, I would appreciate your advice.

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation,

Very truly yours,

STANLEY D. FRIEDMAN

January 5, 1967

Distinguished Sirs:

I was surprised when I read your letter notifying me of the permanent suspension of the pension I received as a result of the wish of Roberto Feres, evidence before his death.

I am very surprised because I had not been advised prior to the end of the month. I have incurred the normal expenses such as rent, light, telephone, gas, etc., and now find myself in a very difficult situation since this means that I am going to lose my credit.

When you suspend the checks or pensions of Brigade members or their families you always notify them of the suspension with their last payment so that they could make the necessary arrangements for the future.

I now am without money to cover me expenses. The month of January is a hard time to find employment here, not to mention that my parents who are old, my daughter, and my sister recently arrived from Cuba and do not receive economic aide from the Refugee Center.

Awaiting your response. I think that you should reconsider my situation at this time with the understanding and generosity os the "great nation" which the Cubans will never forget.

Attentively,

/s/ Miguelina Teurbe

Miami Beach, Florida

Dear Mrs. Tourbe:

Effective January 1, 1967 the adjustment of certain payments, including those applicable in your case, is being placed in effect.

Concerning the case of Roberto Perez Cruzata, a review of records and the results of an investigation indicate that although Roberto Perez Cruzata may have planned to marry Miguelina Tourbe following his return from Cuba, the marriage did not take place. Therefore, Miguelina Tourbe is not entitled to payments as his widow, and no further payments will be forthcoming.

The following additional payments which have been made to Miguelina Tourbe are also being terminated effective January 1, 1967 for the reasons given.

The mother of Roberto Perez Cruzata is now deceased.

The father of Roberto Perez Cruzata resides in Cuba; no evidence has been presented to show that he has received any of the funds intended for him.

The child, Kathleen Fritz, is the daughter of Mr. Harry Fritz and is not related to Roberto Perez Cruzata; thus, she is not entitled to benefits as a dependent of Roberto Perez Cruzata.

Sincerely yours,

John L. McKerscher

Dear Mr. Friedman:

This is in regard to your letter of September 19, 1967 requesting to be advised of the reason for the discontinuance of payments heretofore made to Mrs. Miguelina Tourbe Fritz.

Financial assistance had been made available to Mrs. Fritz with the mistaken understanding that she was the surviving widow of Roberto PEREZ Cruzata. That assistance was in the nature of a gratuity and was in no way based on a contract of insurance.

As indicated in my letter of December 31, 1966, a review of this matter showed that Mrs. Fritz had never been married to Roberto PEREZ Cruzata and, therefore, was not his widow. Upon finding that she lacked the requisite status, it became necessary to discontinue financial aid.

While your interest in this matter is understandable, I must advise that no further payments can be made.

Sincerely yours,

John L. McKercher

References: A. UFCW-6607, 13 July 1967
B. UFGA-27805, 14 June 1967

1. As suggested in Reference B, ANTIKI-1 advised the widow that the only legal means for purchasing passage from Cuba to Spain with US dollars was by purchasing the passage at Iberia Airlines* Madrid office. In a letter dated 11 September 1967, the widow acknowledged receipt of the letter from ANTIKI-1 and stated that she had contacted the Iberia office in Havana and had been told that this procedure is no longe allowed. The widow then went to the National Bank of Cuba whore she was advised that the only way she could purchase passage would be to receive funds in Canadian currency through the Cuban bank. The bank suggested that the fastest way to effect the transaction would be to have the money sent by telegraphic transfer through a Canadian bank to the National Bank of Cuba.

2. A check with the Iberia Airlines representative in the JHWAVE area confirmed that the procedure suggested by Headquarters' is not permissible. The representative stated that the procedure suggested by the National Bank of Cuba was correct, adding that a Spanish bank and Spanish currency could be utilized instead of Canadian if so desired.

3. Headquarters guidance regarding the adviseability of effecting such a transfer of funds to Cuba through Canada or Spain is requested. Attached are copies of recent correspondence concerning this case.

Attention: Mr. Administrator

Sir:

I am writing to you to ask you to do me the favor of informing Mr. John Paulbath that I urgently need him to contact me because I want him to send the passages to me to go (to the U.S.) via Spain.

The reason I have taken the liberty of writing is that in November of last year, I wrote to Mr. Paulbath at PO Box 427, Tamiami Station in that city and after almost six months the letter was returned to me with the notation that the address was not registered. Since that time a friend of mine who lives in Los Angeles has been trying to locate him and to date has had no success.

Mr. Paulbath sent me a notice informing that the monthly stipend due me (as a result of the death of my husband) per dotal policy 1023, was being deposited in that bank, enclosed is that notice. The last news I had from Mr. Paulbath was in February 1966 when he informed me that on that date the account showed a balance of US $12,518.21.

I appeal to your kindness for help, since I have been trying for more than six years since my husband died R.I.P. to leave (Cuba). I almost had all my papers in order to leave when the American Embassy was closed that was two months after my husband had departed (Cuba), later in April of that same year came the Bay of Pigs Invasion and my husband was killed. On 1 June my daughter was born and it was at this time that they began to grant visa waivers but even though I had the visas I could not leave because I had not been able to get a passport for my daughter since to obtain it they demanded my husband's death certificate and his death was not recorded in any court, I went to all the places it could have been recorded. Then I began to visit lawyers and government offices to find out how I could obtain a passport for my daughter. After much fighting, it was delivered to me at the end of November of last year. I immediately wrote to Mr. Paulbath to ask that he send me the money for passages right away and that was the letter that was returned to me.

Since letters from there to here take so long, I request that you tell Mr. Paulbath to send me the money for passages for those indicated below:

Concepcion PASTRANA Cernuda (US $154.00)
Serafin CERNUDA Garcia (US $308.00)
Graciela CERNUDA Fernandez (US $308.00)
Maria CERNUDA Fernandez (US $308.00)

and also tell him that the money for all should be sent to the following address:

Colina #33, Jesus del Monte, Habana, Cuba.

Tell Mr. Paulbath that if there is anything I can resolve call
me at telephone number 99-2187 or send me a night letter since хеднах

Dear Ur, Paulbath:

I acknowledge receipt of your letter of agust 7 ic which you inforo me that it is possible for you to place funds to cover the mount of pasanges at the Iberia Airlines in Madrid, Iberia then notifying their Havana Office that the tickets have been pre- paid and are therefore available for issuance, but I am sorry to say that this procedure is no longer allowed.

I found it out by calling personally on Iberia Airlines Acre, in Havana, efter which I went to the Cuban National Bank where I was told that the only way the tickets could be purchased was upon my receiving the funds through the Cuban National Bank in Canadian currency. They also suggested that the fastest way to carry out the transaction was that the money be sent by telegraphic transfer through a Canadian bank to the National Bank of Cuba, the cost of passage for an adult bel: $370.00 and $185.00 for a misor.

1. Adjustments during the fourth quarter FY 1967 of AMBUD monthly dependency payments are reported herewith in accordance with Reference A:

Case #29: ALEMAN Aleman, Eufrasio (201-290-479)
Payee: ALEMAN, Laureana C. (mother)

Effective with the May payment, the amount of the monthly payment was reduced from $225.00 to $175.00 because of the death of the father, Angel ALEMAN Perez.

Case #127: CAMPO Gutierrez, Rafael (201-292-430)
Payee: CAMPO Ojoda, Pablo (father)

Effective with the Juno payment, the monthly amount formerly paid to the trustee will be paid to the father who arrived in the United States in February and currently resides at 1115 Medina Street, Opa Locka, Florida. In addition, the monthly payment was reduced from $225.00 to $175.00 effective with the Juno payment as a result of the death of the mother, Catalina GUTIERREZ.

2. The following concerns the remaining two cases for which payments were temporarily suspended pending replies from the payees as reported in Reference C:

Case #142: GUTIERREZ Izaguirre, Jorge (201-278754)

Case #143: KIM Yun, Jorge (201-298852)
Payee: SANTOVENIA, Raul (trustee)

Monthly payments for this case were temporarily suspended effective with the January 1967 payment pending a reply to a request for biographic data on the parents. Based on the fact that Subject had been executed for a crime committed prior to his participation at the Bay of Pigs and also on the probability that the father, Pedro KIM, is identical with a person with the same name who ANTIKI-1 alleges to be an active Communist in Cuba (Station traces describe one Pedro KIM as an active Communist), the Station recommended that payments be terminated for this case and the recommendation was approved by Headquarters. The trustee has been informed of the suspension of payments and has also been advised that should one or both parents come to the United States, a review of the case will be made in accordance with procedures in effect at that time.

3. The following changes in payees are being reported for Headquarters records:

Case #3: BLANCO Cruz, Benito (201-283944)

In accordance with written instructions from the widow, Verania TORRES Tellez, the trusteeship for this case has been transferred from Olga LINAN to Juana BLANCO, Subject's daughter, who resides at 4061 NW 4th Terrace, Miami, Florida.

Case #74: ORIA Finales, Luis (201-283201)

The monthly payment for the mother, Pastora FINALES Hernandez, which was formerly sent to trustee Eladio GONZALEZ Finales is now sent directly to the mother who arrived in the United States a short time ago and is residing in California with a son.

Your re.: Allotment HM

Dear Mr. ---

As per your request, I tried to obtain copy of my marriage certificate from Cuba. Despite my efforts I have been unable to secure one.

However, copies of my husband's and my daughter's birth certificates, issued some time ago, were forwarded to me.

Marginal note on my husband's certificate shows entry of our marriage and our daughter's also mentions the fact of said marriage.

I am enclosing photocopies of both documents. Should you require the originals, I will be happy to forward them to you as long as they are returned to me since these are the only copies in my possessioh.

I will continue to try to secure copy of my marriage cer- tificate which I will forward to you, should I obtain it.

Trusting these documents will be of help to you, I am.

Very truly yours

Marina Mardones Vivanco

C. UFGA-25261, dated 3 June 1966

1. Headquarters concurs in JMWAVE's proposed action refusing payment of additional funds to Subject of reference. Apparently Subject had not advised AMBIDDY of the regular support payments paid by AMTIKI at the time reference B requested data concerning the case. Neither is there any indication on the HEW form forwarded in reference C that additional income was being received by Subject from AMBIDDY. It would, therefore, appear that AMBIDDY may have indicated there was some connection between the source of AMTIKI and AMBIDDY funds and suggested Subject approach ANTIKI for the terminated AMBIDDY income.

2. In any event, subject letter did provide copies of the type of vital documents JNWAVE is attempting to obtain in order to document Heroes and Martyrs for possible future payments by BEC.

Chicago, May 8, 1967

Dear Mr.

In your letter of 1 May 1967 you asked me for my marriage certificate and my son's birth certificate, I do not have them because my home was immediately intervened by the so-called Comandante Felix Torres who burned my family passport and wouldn't even let me get my son's clothing. My cousin (?), Porfirio's brother Rodolfo RAMIREZ AMG clandestinely went to the coasts of Cuba to get me. I am sending you photostatic copies of our parolee cards. I believe they will suffice but at the same time I will write to Porfirio's mother who is still in Cuba since she has not been given permission to leave and come to this country and I will ask her to get copies of the marriage certificate. I will send them to you as soon as I receive them.

Thanks again,
/s/ Clara DELGADO

Mr.

The only paper that I have in my possession is my daughter's birth certificate. My marriage certificate is in Cuba. I cannot send anyone to get it because the person who xxxesxis goes to get it would be persecuted because the name of my husband is on it. Attached is the child's certificate. I would appreciate your letting me know if this is sufficient since trying to obtain mine would be difficult.

Attentively,

Investigation of Trust Account for Case #142, GUTIERREZ Izaguirre, Jorge

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCED
Reference: UFGW-6306, 8 December 1966

1. The information requested by Headquarters in paragraph two of Reference concerning the funds held in trust for Jorge GUTIERREZ Izaguirre (prisoner) has been obtained from the trustee, Mr. Orlando FERNANDEZ and is forwarded herewith.

2. According to Mr. FERNANDEZ, an arrangement with the family of Subject provides that Mr. FERNANDEZ (who now resides in Tampa) receive the monthly payment of $225.00 and forward it to an uncle of Subject, Evelio CORZO (in Miami), who is responsible for the forwarding of assistance to the Subject and his parents in Cuba. Mr. FERNANDEZ further stated that there are actually two bank accounts which he described as follows:

a. Dade Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Miami, Florida, account number 04-439677. January 1967 balance: $6,748.36. The account is in the name of Subject's uncle and aunt, Evelio and Lillian CORZO.

b. The Exchange Bank of Temple Terrace, Tampa, Florida, account number 3627. January 1967 balance: $675.00. The account is in the name of the trustee, Mr. Orlando FERNANDEZ.

Mr. FERNANDEZ explained the reason for two bank accounts as follows: During the time that the trustee resided in Miami, the check was deposited by Mr. CORZO in the CORZO account. When the trustee moved to Tampa (date unknown) Mr. CORZO told the trustee that in view of the ample funds on deposit ir Miami, the trustee should open a savings account in Tampa for the deposit of future payments.

3. For Headquarters further information, the trustee provided documentation from the family in Cuba, dated 25 February 1967, which designates Evolio CORZO Izaguirre as the representative for Subject. JUWAVE traces on CORZO are as follows:

### GENERAL CONTENTS

"MILITARY SECTION"

December 1 to 31, 1960

In the Statements and Annexes attached, appeared the analysis and sub-analysis of each of the incomes and expenses during the month of December.

The receipts, bills, deposit sheets, checks returned by the bank, and other justificatory certificates of the operations of the month, are in our records. In the cases that the justificatory certificates were not given, there are in our records the memorandums on account of which the checks were made.

In December 31, 1960, there are still Reimbursements to collect in the amount of $350.00 that correspond to the check No.21 of October 4, in the name of Mr. A. Fernández Corell, from the Military Section.

The increase of the Revolving Fund of the Military Section was reimbursed to the Comptroller by the Military Coordinator, but same were not deposited in the bank, since we have learned in practice the necessity of disposal of cash with urgent need, in more than one time, and to solve these cases we decided to maintain this Fund in our hands, but at the Military Coordinator's disposition.

RESUME OF THE INCOME AND EXPENSES OPERATIONS
"PAULA AND SOSA"
October 1 to 31, 1960

In the financial statements and annex the analysis and sub-analysis of each one of the income and liabilities during the month of October are shown.

Receipts, invoices, deposit slips and other papers are kept in our files. As shown on Annex "I-D", a Revolving Fund has been created for the Military Section, amounting to the sume of $10,000.00, divided into two parts of $5,000.00 each, the amount of $3,387.81, was reinbursed to this Revolving Fund, as per Annex "I-D".

The amount of $50,000.00 which appears as "Transferences" in Annex "I-M" corresponds to the transfered amount from the account of "Paula and Sosa" to "Rasco and Paula" account.

From this amount, we have paid in advance the November payment of the military dependants.

In relation to "Checks to Justify", amounting to $69,288.52, as per Annex "I-P", these could be classified in two groups; one formed by those corresponding to amounts advanced accouding to budget to the different Committees and Delegations and the other, formed by certain expenses to be made, but specifically determined, with receipts dully signed. The later could have been distributed to those accounts within the cassification, thus eliminating them from the title "to justify", but have been kept as so, to be sure of the making of this expense for the purpose to which the checks were drown for, or its actual classification, if these expense were made for other purposes than those originally aimed to. This is due to the fact that some checks were drawn for a specific purpose; they could also have been applied to acquire some other asset, thus appearing at the end of the month a false balance, since it would appear as an expense, what it actually is an asset.

Section designated as "Transferences" $50,000.00 is compensated with an income for the same amount, when making a transference of funds to the "Rasco and Paula" account to pay through it the payroll of the Military Dependants, but through a mistake it was deposited again in the same account.

"PAULA AND SUSA"
RESUMEN DE LAS OPERACIONES DE INGRESOS Y EGRESOS
Octubre 1 al 31 de 1960

En los Estados y Anexos que se adjuntan aparecen los análisis y sub---
análisis de cada una de las partidas de ingresos y egresos habidas durante el mes de Octubre de 1960.

Los recibos, facturas, hojas de depósitos y demás comprobantes justificativos de las operaciones del mes, obran en nuestro poder.

Como podrá observarse en el Anexo "I-D" se ha creado un -Fondo Fijo-- para el Sector Militar, ascendente a $10,000.00 (en dos partidas de - $5,000.00), habiéndose procedido a reintegraradicho Fondo Fijo, durante el mes de Octubre, la cantidad de $3,357.61, según puede verse en el Anexo "I-L".

La partida de $50,000.00 que aparece como "TRANSFERENCIAS" en el Anexo "I-I", corresponde a la cantidad transferida de la cuenta "PAULA AND SOSA" a la cuenta "RASCC AND FAULA", a través de la cual se ha pagado- la asignación adelantada del mes de Noviembre de los familiares de los hombres que se encuentran en el Campo.

En relación con los "CHECKS A JUSTIFICAR", que importan $69,288.52, según Anexo "I-P", los mismos pudieran clasificarse en dos grupos: uno - formado por aquellos que corresponden a cantidades adelantadas de acuerdo con presupuestos a las distintas Comisiones o Delegaciones, y otro - que lo integran algunas partidas consignadas a un tipo de gasto a realizar, pero específicamente determinado, con sus correspondientes recibos debidamente firmados. Estos últimos pudieron haberse distribuído- a las cuentas que responden dentro de la clasificación, con lo que hubieran sido eliminados del concepto "A JUSTIFICAR", pero se han mantenido como tales, a los efectos de tener la seguridad de la realización del gasto para el concepto que fueron extendidos los checks, o su verdadera clasificación si esas cantidades fueron utilizadas en erogaciones distintas a aquellas para que fueron originalmente consignadas. Esto es debido a que algunos checks extendidos para un concepto determinado, pudieran, inclusive, aplicarse a la adquisición de algún activo.

RESUMEN DE LAS OPERACIONES DE INGRESOS Y EGRESOS

Hoja No. 2

con lo cual aparecería en la fecha de cierre del mes, un balance que -no sería fiel a la verdad, pues aparecería como un gasto, lo que en realidad es un activo.

La partida denominada "TRANSFERENCIAS" ($50,000.00) está compensada con un ingreso por la misma cantidad, y se originó al querer hacerse una transferencia de fondos a la cuenta "RASCO AND PAULA", para pagar a través de ella la nómina de asistencia social, pero por error se hizo el depósito del check No. 255 por $50,000.00 en la misma cuenta de "PAULA AND SOSA".

# GASTOS DE VIAJES

En el anexo-l podrán observar a quines fuerón extendidos los distintos cheques, asi como la cuantía ascendente de cada egreso.

Aunque la partida # 1 aparece cargada al Dr. Luis Aguilar Leba según informe verbal, solamente correspondió a dicho señor $200.00 y los $400.00 restantes al Dr. Aureliano Sanchez Arango.

La partida #8 a nombre del Dr. Manuel Antonio de Varona por --


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 368

Dr. Aureliano Sanchez Arango.

Entry 3 in the name of Dr. Manuel Antonio de Varona in the amount of $931.49, according to a "statement" in our possession does not consist totally of 'Traveling Expenses", however due to the fact that the Department of Finances claimed the vouchers for the month of July, the analysis of this entry was not possible in spite of having carried out the corresponding measures for obtaining a copy of the statement submitted by Dr. Varona.

Entry #12 in the name of Dr. Manuel Artime for $100.00 is not the result of a check made out in his name but was an amount delivered by Dr. Justo Carrillo in Mexico City according to a "statement for reimbursement" in the amount of $834.20 submitted to the Front during the month of July.

Entry 14 in the amount of $211.05 in the name of Dr. Justo Carril10 corresponda to the reimbursement made to him in the amount of $834.20. The difference between $834.20 and $211.05 corresponds to other types of expenses which are given in detail below.

The remaining entries are self-explanatory in Attachment-1.

The "Traveling Expenses" for the past month of June are excluded.

PROPAGANDA

In Attachment-2 all expenses under this account are given in detail.

Entry #105 in the amount of $500.00 corresponds to the payment for advertisements made in Mexico by Dr. Justo Carrillo, according to a statement for reimbursement in the amount of $834.20 submitted by him.

PERSONNEL

In Attachment-3 the personnel are listed with their monthly, weekly
Charges
or incidental salaries with/to the office of the Front in the Congress Building.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 369

$931.49, según "estado" que estuvo en nuestro poder, no es totalrente de "Gastos de Viajes", pero debido a que el Departamento de Pinanzas reclamó los comprobantes del mes de Julio, no fué posible el analisis de dicha partida, no obstante haber realizado las gestiones correspondientes para obtener una copia del estado presentado por el Dr. Varona.

La partida # 12 a nombre del Dr. Manuel Artime por $100.00, no es producto de un cheque girado a su nombre, sino que fue una cantidad entregada por el Dr. Justo Carrillo en la ciudad de México, según el "estado de reintegro por $834.20, presentado en el mes de Julio al Frente.

La partida # 14 por $211.05, a nombre del Dr. Justo Carrillo, corresponde al reintegro que se le hizo de $834.20. La diferencia entre los $834.20 y $211.05, corresponde a otros tipos de gastos, que más adelante se detallan.

Las otras partidas se explican por si sola en el anexo-1.

Estan excluidos los "Gastos de Viajes del mes de Junio próximo pasado.

PROPAGANDA

En el anexo-2 están detallados todos los gastos realizados bajo ésta cuenta.

La partida # 105 por $500.00, corresponde al pago por anuncios efectuado en México por el Dr. Justo Carrillo, según estado de reintegro por $834.20 por el presentado.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 370

## SUSTENANCS AND RENTS

In Attachment-4 the various entries under this title are explained.

Entry #400 of 2 July 1960, check 22, was for the payment of rent for the office of the DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRONT at 1001 Congress Building, Miami.

Entry #402 of 27 July, check 64, in the name of Abel Varona vas used to give food, from 27 July to 2 August 1960, both dates inclusive, to the following persons: Miguel Penton, Hugo Zamora, Martin Torres, Giraldo Serafin Penton, Orlando Garcia, Claudio Orozco, Benigno Perez, Humberto Cordero, and Felix Sosa.

As you may note the expenses under this title will necessarily increase, therefore an ample estimate destined to cover future needs is advisable.

Check 67 of 27 July 1960 in the name of the jabor leader Fascasio Linera was made void.

## COMMUNICATIONS

The expenses of this title are listed in Attachment-5. The principal entries are 500 and 501 in the amounts of $400.00 and $300.00 for postage stamps. If we were to render account of the magnitude which propaganda must have of the Front sent by maily, these costs are ridiculous.

The costs of long distance calls charged to Dr. Justo Carrillo for $23.15 appear in the "statement for reimbursement" for $334.20 which he submitted for the month of July.

The long distance calls (:) of Dr. Jose I. Rasco were paid by the Fixed Fund which exists in the Front's office.

Como ustedes observarán los gastos de éste epigrafe, necesariamente irá aumentando, por lo que es aconsejable un amplio estimado destinado a cubrir sus necesidades futuras.

## OFFICE SUPPLIES

COMUNICACIONES

Los gastos de éste titulo están relacionados en el anexo-5. Las partidas principales son la 500 y 501, por $400.00 y $300.00 en sellos de correo. Si nos damos cuenta de la magnitud que debe tener la propaganda enviada por correo del Prente, éstos gastos resultan irrisorios.

# GENERAL

In compliance with what has been established, of evimitting to you a report at the close of each month, I am attaching herewith a STATEMENT OF PECEIPTS AND EXPENDITUNES corresponding to the month of July 1960.

In spite of the fact that all expenditures were rade by check in the name of the respective pereons, there was an oversight in not requiring detailed receipts or vouchers of payment for furls drawn from the persons concerned.

On the trip to New York, suggested by you, a series of control measures were imposed upon me which I am also sending separately in order for you to deliberate the same. In addition to those written measures there are other verbal suggestions which are of importance.

Once you have read the control measure you will makerstand that the management of the funds of the DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY PHONT is lacking from what is required, for which reason a true relationship between the Precutive (Committee) and the Comptroller would be convenient in order to provide you with better efficiency.

I understand that it is troublesome, in accordance with the rank of the renbers of the Executive Committee, to render accounts of the cash received, best in accepting the conditions suggested by the Department of Pinances,

I find myself forced to inform you that it is the obligation of all those receiving funds to render accounts unless exceptions are made or established for the Executive Committee.

I understand that the reason why the measures required by the Department of Financen in the manager:ent of the funds of the FRONT were not established has beon due to the fact that the suggested controls were not known at the clcse of the month of July.

# GENERAL

Cumpliendo con lo establecido, de rendirles un informe al cierre de cada mes, les estoy adjuntando un ESTADO DE INGRESOS Y GASTOS correspondiente al mes de Julio de 1960.

No obstante haberse efectuado todos los egresos por cheques a nombre de las respectivas personas, se incurrió en el descuido de no pedir recibos detallados o comprobantes de pagos, por quien corresponda, del efectivo girado.

En el viaje a New York, por ustedes indicado, fui impuesto de una serie de medidas de control, las cuales tambien remito aparte, para que deliberen sobre las mismas, existiendo además de las escritas, otras indicaciones verbales de importancia.

Una vez leídas las medidas de control, comprenderán que el manejo de los fondos del FRENTE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO, dista algo de lo requerido, razón por la cual seria conveniente una verdadera inter-relación entre el Ejecutivo y la persona del Comptroller, para que pueda asta brindarles eficiencia.

Comprendo que es enojoso, de acuerdo con la jerarquia de los integrantes del Comité Ejecutivo, el estar rindiendo cuenta del efectivo recibido, pero de aceptar las condiciones sugeridas por el Departamento de Finanzas, me veo compelido a informarles que es obligación de todos los que reciban efectivo, rendir cuenta, salvo que logren o establescan excepciones para el Ejecutivo.

Comprendo que la razón de no haberse establecido las medidas requeridas por el Departamento de Finanzas en el mane-

I would appreciate it, with the same frankis:se with which I have written these lines, if you would inform me if there is the slightest disagreement among any of the members of the Executive (Committee) and the person who is to fill the post of Comptroller so that in this manner I will not present an obstacle and can decline in favor of another person. If this is to the contrary it is a pleasure for me to be at the disposal of that worthy organization.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 397

jo de los fondos del FRENTE, se debió a no conocer el control sugerido, llegado al final del mes de Julio.

Les agradecería, con la misma franqueza que expongo estas líneas, que me manifiesten si existe la mas ligera discrepancia entre alguno de los integrantes del Ejecutivo y el que va a ocupar el cargo de Comptroller, para de esta forma no obstasulisar y declinar en favor de otra persona. De lo contrario, de muy buen agrado estoy a la disposición de ese digno organismo.

paid by the bank and we are in doubt as to whether
is was cancelled since the receipt or the invoice which
covered it is not in our possession, in which case the
cash available in the bank would be increased to $113.54
(One hundred thirteen pesos and fifty-nine cents) on
31 August. There is in addition a Fixed Fund amounting
to $100.00 (one hundred pesos).

TRIPS (ATTACHMENT "I-E")

Trips have been grouped, with those made by the executives of the Front being considered independently, and in a general manner, under the title of miscellaneous (traveling expenses), such as they appear in Attachment "I-E", all other traveling expenses. Traveling expenses corresponding to checks 89,123, 129, 131 and 132 have no other justification except the duly signed receipts, but not the vouchers justifying the manner in which the expenses were incurred in each case.

SUSTENANCE AND RENTS (ATTACHMENT "I-F")

These expenses are classified in two groups in Attachment "I-F": Rents ($2,954.86) and Allowances and Other Expenses ($9,297.45). Many of the rents do not have the corresponding receipt but they do have a receipt signed by the person who it is supposed received the money to pay these rents as can be seen in the files of receipts, invoices, etc.

The vouchers for allowances, food (meals), etc., are not presented as clearly as they should have been with regard to clarity and the organization of the same, however, instructions have been issued for the purpose of obtaining a better presentation of the same. Check # 82 includes two entries of $300.00 each, the receipts of which are in the names of Messrs. Roberto Varona and Rolando Rojas as well as another entry of $125.00 in the name of the latter. The receipts are not signed and these gentlemen are out of the country.

In compliance with the instructions received, we have attempted to render a report on the operations for the month of August which will agree as much as possible with the needs required and which will include the greatest amount of information possible for the purpose of having a quick and precise understanding of the month's operations.

Together with this report we are sending, as we have been requested to do, all vouchers in correlative order following the numbering of the chocks issued. Due to certain confusion regarding: the sulcision of receipts, invoices, etc., which has already been overcome since precise instructions have been issued, we have had soma difficulties in the perfect classification of expenditures.

## COMISIONES O DELEGACIONES (AFEXO "I-I")

Se extendieron durante el mes tres Checks que corresponden a lo siguientes

a) Parte del Check No. 82 a nombre de Marmel A. Verona, por $1,917.68, del que se enviaren a la Delegacion de Mexice $200.00 mas los gastes del d-ra que ascendieren a $1.20%

b) Parte del Check No. 83 a nombre de Manuel A. Varona, per $928.13 del que se temaren $100.00 que fueron entregados al Er. R. Otero Berlaff para la Comision Obrera,

c) Total del Check No. 88 per $600.00 a nombre del Sr. Jose M. Hernandes para atender gastos de la Comisien Obrera, digo, Juridica.

## VARIOS (ANEIO "I-J")

Bajo este concepto se han agrupade aquellas partidas de gastos que per su naturaleza ne ha sido facil clasificarlas especificamente dentro de las clasificaciones anteriores. Su importe total asciende a $1,332049, y en el Anexe "I-J" aparece analizado este totale

## CHECKS A JUSTIFICAR (AMEXO )

Baje esta denominacion se han clasificado aquell-os checks extendides da-rante el mes, y que sun en Agosto 31 no se habian justificado los gastos incurrides con cargo a cada uno de elles. Les recibes estan firmados, y tan pranto se reciban los justificantes de los mismos, dichos gastos seran clasificados y elevados inmediatamente.

## GENERAL

Hemos tratado, cumpliendo las instrucciones recibidas, de rendir un inferme de las operaciones del mes de Agoste, que se ajuste lo mas posible a las necesidades requeridas, y que abarque la mayor cantidad posible de informacion a les efectos de tener un enfoque rapido y preciso de las operaciones del mes.

Tal como se nos ha pedido, estanes enviande, conjuntamente con este informe todes los comprobantes, por orden correlativo, siguiendo la numeracion de les Checks extendidos. Debido a cierta desorganizacion en cuante a la presentacion de los recibos, facturas, etc., que ya se esta superando, pues se han dado instrucciones precisaa, hemos tenido dificultadas para la perfecta clasificacion de los egreses.

De la revision de les mencionades comprobantes podran observarse ciertas normalidades, mas bien en la forma que en el fonds. For ejemplo, el Check No. 12h no ha sido justificado con los recites, facturas, etc. correspondientes, si no con una relacion de gastos que aparece firmada por el Sr. Manuel Artime. El Check No. 126 tiene los comprobantes justificativos, pero en algunos casos no aparecen firmados por las personas que recibieren les cantidades consignadas y si por el Sr. Jose Arriola. Tantien se dieron instrucciones para evitar esto en el future.

Continuation

In reviewing the above-centioned vouchers one can observe certain irregularities rore în form than in furde. For example, check # 124 has not teen justified with the corresponding receipts, inveicus, etc., but with a list of emerces signed by Mr. Manuel Artime. Check 126 does have the justifying receipts, but in some cases they are not signed by the persons who received the amounts sienod but were signed by dr. Jose Arriola. Instructions were also issued to prevent this in the future.

Included in the receipts files are the bark deposit slips which correspond to all amornts deposited during the month of August to the "PASCO AND PAULA" account in the Florida National Pank and Trust Company.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
J. Walton Moore

THROUGH:
Head of Career Service

SUBJECT:
Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their even- tual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each employee well in advance of the date he is scheduled for retirement. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to advise you that you are scheduled to retire on 5 October 1979.

2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To assist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You will, in the near future, be invited by the Retirement Counselor for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling session, or more than one if you wish. This phase of retirement planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement system under which you will retire. The individual counseling sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits, life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, relocation and movement of household effects and assistance in obtaining other employment. In addition, you will be invited to attend a Retirement Information Seminar that will be offered in the autumn of 1974.

3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the scheduled date and who wish to commence their planning as early as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe you would benefit from such an earlier start on your personal planning, you are entitled to contact the Retirement Counselor responsible for your Directorate at the Retirement Affairs Division, 212 Magazine Building, on telephone extension 3328.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. J. Walton Moore

THROUGH: Head of IT Career Service

SUBJECT: Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomination is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board who recommends final action to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board. This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the system may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a participant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your record it appears that the decision of your career Service was based upon the fact that you have 15 years or more of agency service, but have not as yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees".

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligible to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to discuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 08-1329 Feadsquarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any question you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP
in the CAREER STAFF of the
CENTRALINTELLIGENCE AGENCY

To the Director of Central Intelligence
Sir:

I submit herewith my application for membership in the Career Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency as defined below:

"The Career Staff of the Centrál Intelligence Agency is a group of carefully selected and trained individuals who accept an obligation to devote themselves to the needs of the Agency, and who intend to make a career with the Agency."

In accordance with this definition, I desire to devote myself to the faithful performance of duty in the Central Intelligence Agency, and I accept the obligations and conditions of that service which are determined to be essential to the furtherance of its mission.

FROM : Chief, FDZ

SUBJECT: Evaluation of James W. MOORE

1. Mr. James W. Moore entered on duty with SSU in December 1945 in a military capacity, and entered on civilian employment on 29 August 1946. During this period he served as commanding officer in Tsing-tao and was later assigned as Vice Consul to Dairen. Mr. Moore was never able to reach Dairen and so was attached for temporary duty to Tsing-tao and Shanghai until April 1948, when he assumed the duties of Chief of Station, Calcutta, India. On or about 7 December Mr. Moore was transferred from OSO to Contact's Division, CO.

2. Mr. Moore's performance as Chief of Station, Calcutta, has been excellent. He has been given an *Excellent* efficiency rating by the Consul General and also received a special commendation for some of his biographic reporting. Mr. Moore was well liked by Consulate personnel, the British, and the natives with whom he came in contact. He is a man of good judgment and commonsense and has carried on OSO operations in a secure and efficient manner.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DEPUTY, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

Subject: Administrative Instruction No. 30-1

1.  Administrative Instruction No. 30-1, dated October 31, 1946, makes provision for Group II classification for civilian employees who are chiefs of missions or principal officers directly subordinate to Washington, D.C. The order specifies that these officials will fall in Grades CAF-13 or F-6 or above, unless otherwise approved by the Director.

2.  I recommend the Group II classification for Mr. James Moore who will be a Chief of Station and directly subordinate to Washington, but whose Grade is below the CAF-13 or F-6 level. It is believed that the fulfillment of the obligation at the Station concerned justifies the Group II classification.

3.  Therefore, there is attached a proposed letter of authorization for the Director's signature. The Director's approval of this proposed letter will permit Special Funds to pay the Group II classification to the individual concerned.

4.  It is recommended that the payment under the Group II classification be made effective as of the date of his assumption of duties at the overseas post.

FROM: Mr. J. Walter Koore J. Walton Moore

SUBJECT: Transportation of Car to China

1. In view of my recent appointment in Shanghai, China to head up SI operations in that area, it is respectively requested that I be allowed to take my car to this port.

2. It is anticipated that a considerable part of my work will of necessity be done at night when office transportation would not be available. The poor transportation system in Shanghai will also make going to and from work very difficult without an automobile.

3. Am willing to reimburse the government funds for all charges in the delivery of my car from the United States to my station.

1st Ind. 23 January 1947

To: ADSO

Through: Asst. Executive for Personnel

1. Basic communication requesting the transportation of privately owed auto is forwarded with a recommendation for approval.

2. It is felt that since Mr. Moore will reimburse this Agency for all expenses connected with the transportation of his private auto, there is no objection to such an arrangement. It will indeed materially aid Mr. Moore in his work to have a car at his disposal. It is understood by Mr. Moore that he will not rent or lease this vehicle to the Government for official use. Should it become necessary for the personnel of the station to use this car for official travel, Mr. Moore will be reimbursed at only the rates allowed by regulations which govern the use of privately owned autos in Government Travel.

I concur in Mr. Watts' evaluation. Mr. Moore is a very good administrator and his office has performed its collection mission very well and provided excellent operational services and support. They have not been tested in our emigre program because of a lack of potential but I am confident they will do the job well as required. I rate Mr. Moore superior in his ability to represent CIA and the Intelligence Community on the outside and he does a very good job in representing DCD within CIA and the Community. In a pinch I feel that I could depend on Mr. Moore more than almost any other DCD field chief of his grade.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Mr. J. Walton Moore

10 February 1977

1. During the period under review, Mr. Moore continued in his assignment as Chief of the DCD Field Office in Dallas, with responsibility for the supervision of a Resident Office in Tulsa and a Residency in Austin. The Houston Resident Office was raised to Field Office status on 1 September 1976, and the New Orleans Resident Office was placed under the newly formed Houston Field Office. Both of these offices were formerly subordinate to the Dallas Field Office.

2. Under Mr. Moore's able direction, the Dallas Field Office has continued to perform the full range of collection and support tasks exceptionally well. The office produces well prepared reports on subjects of priority intelligence interest. Mr. Moore is a quiet and efficient manager with high personal and professional standards. He is well liked and respected.

3. During this rating period, Mr. Moore and the Dallas Field Office were formally commended by the Office of Strategic Research for timely reporting of information which resulted in substantial improvement of an estimate on Soviet military medical staffing. The information supplied by Mr. Moore"...resulted in a reduction of over 500,000 in the Community's estimate of the total number of Soviet military personnel."

4. Extraordinarily fine work has been done under Mr. Moore's direction during this rating period supporting the activities of the FR Base. The FR Base is relatively new and has depended heavily on Mr. Moore's readiness to support it in the early stages of development. In November 1976, Mr. Moore was formally commended by the FR Base Chief "...for his outstanding support to the new Dallas Base during the period October 1975 to October 1976. ... The level of overall support from DCD Dallas was consistently outstanding." Under Mr. Moore's management, the Dallas Office support of FR objectives is among the most effective and comprehensive in DCD.

5. Mr. Moore is a strong supporter of the Emigre Task Force Program, and the Dallas Office is responsive to cases and requests assigned by this project. The potential in the Dallas area is not as great as in other major cities of equivalent size, but the office has performed very well against those targets available.

6. Mr. Moore is an experienced and effective officer; the Dallas Field Office under his careful and tactful management is a productive and smooth functioning office.

Waltonllore.

Mr. Moore's long and unique experience in the FBI, OSS, and CIA coupled with his background in China and his admirable personal qualities make him a very valuable asset to DCD. When he recommends something to me, I know he will be correct; when he is asked to represent the Agency in some highly important contact, I know he will do it well and rake an excellent, professional impression, and I can count on him to run a very good office with a high level of productive activity.

I feel very comfortable and very confident with Jim Moore in Dallas.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Mr. James Walton Moore

1. Mr. Moore continued in his assignment as Chief of the DCD Field Office in Dallas, during the period under review, with responsibility for the supervision of the Resident Offices in Houston, New Orleans and Tulsa and a Residency in Austin. His Letter of Instruction remains current.

2. The Dallas Field Office, under Mr. Moore's perceptive and competent direction, produces a good volume of quality foreign intelligence reporting. DCD headquarters officers consider the Dallas Field Office performance to be of high caliber. The office is highly responsive to headquarters direction, and there is a strong commitment to quality performance. Mr. Moore has the Dallas Field Office fitting smoothly into the DCD organizational framework. Morale is high and Dallas field personnel, both professional and clerical, feel a sense of importance in their mission. This spirit and pride in their work stems directly from the positive tone set by Mr. Moore.

3. Mr. Moore has extended the hand of cooperation unstintingly to the FR Base which is in an embryonic phase of development. Base officers are enthusiastic about the cooperation received from the Dailas office and the willingness of Mr. Moore to be of assistance. Cooperation between the Dallas office and FR is among the very best in DCD. In addition to the fine support supplied to FR, Dallas had made an important contribution, during the period under review, to the cost-analysis program of Format. Support to operations, through the Operations Services Group, is excellent and a good variety of operational leads and operational reporting is received from the Dallas office.

4. Mr. Moore is a capable and efficient manager. The Dallas office structure presents a complex and difficult management challenge. Through his experience and mature judgment, Mr. Mocre has directed the activities of the office smoothly and effectively.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur in this evaluation. My principal interaction with Jim Moore during the year has been the result of our mutual concern for the well-being of a capable officer who performs well and has growth potential but who is difficult to work with and has, on occasions, apparently been on the brink of a physical breakdown brought on by tension, overwork and other factors. In his approach to this problem, Jim has been concerned, compassionate, responsible, and thoroughly professional.

Under Jim's direction, the Dallas complex has achieved a high ranking among DCD offices and is holding it.

While Jim Moore is a long-time DCD officer, he seems to have lost none of his enthusiasm and drive. He is a valued and respected colleague.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: MOORE, J. Walton

1. Jim Moore continued in his assignment as Chief of the DCD Field Office in Dallas during the period under review, with responsibility for the supervision of Resident Offices in Houston, New Orleans and Tulsa, and a new Residency in Austin. His Letter of Instruction dated 7 November 1973 remains current.

2. The Dallas Field office with its four satellite offices represents the most complicated field office structure in DCD. While Mr. Moore's staff consists of only nine officers and seven secretaries, more than half are located outside the field office. The Dallas Office requires a chief who is experienced in resident office operations, is able to motivate and manage people from a distance, and who can keep personally familiar with a wide variety of activities. Mr. Moore is admirably qualified. He has been able to, coordinate these essentially independent activities most efficiently. His entire organization performs in a responsive and highly effective manner and produces timely, well balanced reporting.

3. Although Mr. Moore's staff was relatively stable during 1974, two of his key officers were incapacitated for extended periods, both at times when the work load was especially heavy. The operating procedures which he has established enabled the office involved to continue to handle priority matters effectively in each instance.

4. On at least two occasions in 1974 Mr. Moore had to intercede in complicated and difficult situations, and in each instance his judgment and highly professional approach resulted in successful solutions.

5. Mr. Moore is a calm, mature, respected and popular officer who handles his complicated job with the easy assurance that comes only from experience and past success. I believe that It is largely due to Mr. Moore's personal reputation that so many of our junior officers want to work in Dallas.

6. During 1974 Mr. Moore recommended the establishment of a one-man residency in Austin as a more efficient way to handle our responsibilities in that part of Texas. We agreed, and the Residency was established in mid-1974. Although it has been in operation only a few months, the wisdom of Mr. Moore's recommendation is already apparent, and I am confident that the success of the Residency will continue.

7. Rating: Strong.

8. A copy of this memorandum, with reviewer's comments, will be forwarded to Mr. Moore.

Career Appointment

Annual Report

Due: 28 February 1974

Reporting Period: 1 January 1973 -

31 December 1973

1. Mr. Moore became Chief of the DCD Field Office in Dallas in June 1973 and was promoted to grade GS-15 in the same month. He had been selected for this position approximately one year earlier, and spent the interim in DCD headquarters as Acting Deputy Chief of the then Soviet Bloc Division. He now supervises one of our most complicated Field Office organizations, with people located in four cities (Dallas, Tulsa, Houston and New Orleans). More than half of the people under his supervision are located outside of Dallas. Perhaps because of his long service as one of our most successful Resident Officers, Mr. Moore excels in supervising this type of operation as a Field Chief. His three-Resident Offices are among thie most responsive and productive in DCD. He delegates duties well and permits his staff the freedom to exercise individual judgment and responsibility. He is both liked and respected by his staff, which shows excellent morale and esprit de corps.

2. Mr. Moore maintains excellent relationships with other Government agencies in his territory, as appropriate, and also with other components of CIA. He manages his many responsibilities efficiently and effectively, and with proper attention to security. He is quick to identify members of his staff who have potential for greater professional advancement, and to give them the necessary encouragement and guidance.

Mr. Moore is the prospective Chief of the Dallas Field Office. He was assigned to DCS headquarters in July 1972 for a familiarization and training tour prior to assuming that post. For approximately six months he served as Acting Deputy Chief of the Soviet Bloc Division, during which he was required to fulfill that role as though it were a permanent assignment. Although he had never been active in headquarters before, he quietly and efficiently familiarized himself with the operations of the division. Through his friendly personality, experience and interested approach he quickly and effectively made what was basically a training role into one of real contribution on a daily basis.

TRAINING REPORT

Advanced Intelligence Seminar No. 4
(100 hours, full-time) (3 - 19 March 1971)

Student: Moore, James W.

Year of Birth: 1919 Grade: GS-14

EOD: July 1947 Service Designation: IT

Office: DCS Number of Students: 28

## COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHODS

The basic objectives of the Advanced Intelligence Seminar (AIS) are to increase the awareness of experienced Agency personnel to: major international and domestic trends affecting US foreign policy and intelligence; key problems and possible organizational changes, facing the intelligence community; recent and projected developments within CIA to meet current and future Agency responsibilities; and major problems of collection, production, coordination and support of intelligence.

Methods of instruction include formal presentations by academic experts, government officials, senior Agency and intelligence community officers, and substantive experts from the Agency. Students are encouraged to participate actively in follow-up discussions both with the speakers and within the class itself. Emphasis is also placed on in-class discussions, using the talents and experiences of the students as a primary resource. For purposes of encouraging open, meaningful exchange, sections of the course are held at Warrenton and ISOLATION, where a more relaxed seminar atmosphere can be developed. Finally, attempts are made to provide provocative-type readings to the students both prior to, and during, the course itself.

## ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only; no attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in this course.

Mr. Moore has demonstrated his outstanding capabilities in handling operational support matters during the forced phase out of certain funding activities which required exceptionally good judgment and much tact.

During this period he has also become responsible for the activities of an Air Force officer from the 1127th Field Activities Group. Through his guidance and effective direction he has been able to integrate this new officer into the production of the Dallas RA in an efficient manner.

3. COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Although Jim Moore is an above average employee I would not rate him Outstanding in specific duties 1, 2 and 6. Duties 1 and 2 because it is difficult to compare his performance with anyone else as he has always held this position. Duty 6 because supervision of 2 other people should not be much of a chore. We are studying the possibility of moving Jim to another assignment to determine how he can perform in a more demanding job.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of distinctions if you so desire. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual: Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the person.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

Section C

Mr. James Walton Moore is hereby nominated for a Career Intelligence Medal in recognition of his substantial contributions to the missions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Strategic Services, the Strategic Services Unit and the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 37 years.

J. Walton (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27, 1930-36) in Shantung Province, China with his missionary parents. Following graduation from Hardin-Simmons University in 1940, Jim joined the FBI and served as a Special Agent in both Chicago and San Francisco. During the latter assignment he reported on pro-Communist elements in Chinatown and directed a US Government panel to interview aliens and US citizens returning home to ensure that enemy agents were not slipping into the US as refugees or foreign businessmen.

Jim joined OSS in November 1944 and was commissioned as an Ensign, USNR. His first assignment was in Kunming where he recruited and trained Chinese agents to infiltrate Japanese lines. While in Kunming he took parachute training and on August 17, 1945 jumped into the Japanese internment camp at Weihsein. Following evacuation of refugees he became Chief of Mission in Tsingtao. Returning to the US in December 1946, he was reassigned as Vice Consul and Chief of Station in Dairen. Soviet intransigence prevented his reaching Dairen so he remained in Tsingtao for an additional year until transferred as Chief of Station in Calcutta, arriving there in April, 1948.

Jim returned to the United States in October 1949 and joined the Contact Division, Office of Operations, CIA. CD/00 policy favored continuity and Jim was no exception. Fron 1949 to 1954 he served in the Houston Field Office and from 1954-1977 as the Resident Officer in Dallas. The Contact Division evolved into the Domestic Contact Service and a reallocation of resources raised the Dallas Resident Office to Field Office status. Jim was the obvious choice for the job. After nine months training and preparation in Washington (where he performed admirably) he was assigned as Chief of the new office with responsibility also for Resident Offices in Tulsa, Houston, New Orleans and, eventually, Austin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 261

Section C (continued)

CONFIDENTIAL

Jim's work in Dallas has been consistently excellent. Under his leadership the Dallas complex has provided timely foreign intelligence in response to worldwide priorities and requirements. As an example, in April 1975 the Acting Director, Stratetic Research commended Jim for "outstanding performance" for urgent special efforts to obtain information which resulted in a reduction of over 500,000 in the Intelligence Community's estimate of the total number of Soviet military personnel.

Similarly, the Dallas Office has provided excellent support to the Clandestine Service. In November, 1976 the Chief, FR Division commended Jim and his staff for "outstanding support" from October 1975-October 1976 in efforts which were "indispensable" to the establishment of FR assets in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in identifying and assessing prospective targets for recruitment.

There are very few persons of potential consequence to the Intelligence Community in Texas who Jim Moore does not know and little that he cannot accomplish there on behalf of Community and Agency requesters.

The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in November 1963, the subsequent allegations against CIA and Jim Moore's long association with Agency interests and programs in Texas have made him a repeated target for media attention and scurrilous innuendo. Although under various forms of severe external pressure as a result, Jim Moore never lost his calm, cool demeanor and has been absolutely dependable in adversity.

An experienced professional, a true gentleman, a delight--ful person, and an example to be emulated, Jim Moore has been a real credit to the intelligence profession. As he approaches retirement, he richly deserves recognition in the form of the Career Intelligence Medal.

Mr. James Walton Moore is hereby awarded the Career Intelligence Medal in recognition of his exceptional achievement with the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 30 years. A charter member of the Agency, Mr. Moore held a series of increasingly responsible positions in which he consistently used his many talents in advancing foreign intelligence objectives. His strong leadership, professionalism and dedication to duty not only enabled his office to provide timely and effective support to worldwide priorities and requirements but also earned for him the admiration and respect of all with whom he worked. Mr. Moore's overall career contributions to the mission of the Agency were substantial and reflect credit on him and the Federal service.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Domestic Collection Division,
DDO
SUBJECT
: Appreciation for Outstanding DCD
Performance

1. I want to express the appreciation of the Office of Strategic Research for the special effort recently made for us by J. Walton Moore of your Dallas field office. Mr. Moore responded quickly to our urgent request to obtain information on Soviet military medical services from DS-2172 and provided it to us on very short notice.

2. Let me give you some background. The subject of Soviet medical personnel emerged as an important issue in a recent community-wide effort to reassess total Soviet military manpower. The community reassessment was stimulated by DIA reporting of several months ago that existing estimates of total Soviet military manpower were low by almost one million men. If correct, the DIA appraisal had potentially serious implications for the ongoing MBFR negotiations as well as a host of intelligence judgments about the dimensions of the Soviet military threat.

3. During the ensuing interagency review of the individual estimates contributed by various agencies in the Washington area, we came to the conclusion that the number of Soviet medical manpower estimated by an Army intelligence group was much too high. A rapid search of headquarters' files turned up barely enough intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion of the medical services, but no direct evidence on total medical manpower. At this point it became clear to us that an improved estimate might be made with information from DS-2172. As we had to present our case to the manpower study Steering Group early in the week of March 24, speed in contacting the Soviet source was essential.

CONFIDENTIAL
27972


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 265

4. The data submitted by the Dallas field office as a result of a specially arranged debriefing provided us with the basis for a much improved estimate of Soviet military medical staffing. Furthermore, Mr. Moore's questions clicited some new information of value to future work. Most important, the results of DCD's efforts contributed significantly to convincing the working group that the original Army estimate was far too high. Eventually the estimate we submitted based upon the information supplied by DS-2172 was accepted by the manpower Steering Group and resulted in a reduction of over 500,000 men in the intelligence community's estimate of the total number of Soviet military personnel.

5. The efforts of your people struck a mighty blow for good intelligence. Many thanks.

To: Chief, SFB. PPD
Subject: Mr. J. Welton Moore, Agent, Contact Office, Dallas, Texas

I should like to call attention to the outstanding cooperation given our activities in Dallas by J. Walton Moore, resident representative in Dallas, Texas.

Mr. Moore has not only extended the normal hospitality of his offices, but has gone out of his way to nominate and talk with exceptional people who come to his attention as potential employes for the Agency. Mr. Moore has contacted me from time to time with names and comments on individuals, and in every way attempted to serve as an active personnel scout in his area. I feel his efforts and time consumed in interviewing people have gone a good deal beyond the normal expectations of our agency, and that this attitude best represents the unified type of teamwork which our organization subscribes to in this work.

While my experiences with the resident offices in my area have been uniformly a pleasant experience, it is a matter of real satisfaction to find a man who is thinking in terms of the Agency as a whole and not of one sharply defined activity. I believe the spirit that Mr. Moore shows should be brought to the attention of his superiors as a prime example of teamwork in the field. It is not only a personal satisfaction to do business with Mr. Moore, but it greatly contributes to the morale of our, efforts by knowing that other offices are as concerned as we are in producing results.

Sincerely,

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in agreement with the Civil Service Act, applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations and an Act of Congress pertaining to appointment.

This form should be reviewed for holding of office, pension, suitability in connection with any record of recent discharge or arrest, and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of Appointee - The appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application and other pertinent papers. The physical appearance may be checked against the medical certificate. The appointee may also be questioned on his personal history for agreement with his previous statements.

(2) Age - If minimum age limits have been established for the position, it should be determined that the appointee is not outside the age range for appointment. Until such determination is made, the appointment may not be consummated.

(3) Citizenship - The appointing officer is responsible for observing the citizenship provisions of (1) the Civil Service Rules and (2) appropriation acts. Form 61 constitutes an affidavit for both purposes and is acceptable proof of citizenship status in the absence of conflicting evidence. In doubtful cases the appointment should not be consummated until clearance has been secured from the certifying office of the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family - Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that whenever there are already two or more members of a family serving under probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service, no other member of such family is eligible for probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service. The appointments of persons entitled to veteran preference are not subject to this requirement. The members-of-family provision does not apply to temporary appointments. Doubtful cases may be referred to the appropriate office of the Civil Service Commission for decision. 10-43180-1

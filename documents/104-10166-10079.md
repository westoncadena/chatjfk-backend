# DISPATCH

Chief of statex. JMAVE

FROM

Chief, Special Affairs Staff

SUBJECT
Letters Received by ANCORE-E

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

REFS: As stated below

REF: UFOT 3613, 3 January 1963

1. Headquarters appreciates receiving the enclosures to UFOT 2737 and the reference. The usefulness of this material, however, could be enhanced considerably if ANCORE-2's source were guided as to the items to be diverted. Also, headquarters envisions an excellent possibility for placing or exchanging items, were it possible to communicate with AMCORE-2's source. Could this be achieved, a profitable relationship with the source might develop, gradually dropping ANCORE-2 out of the picture.

2. JMAVE is requested to try to get the identity of ANCORE-2's source and/or to consider ways to establish contact.

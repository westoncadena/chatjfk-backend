OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30, 1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations /Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5412 Augmented by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress." (00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro. The plan itself-at-pages-00183-through-00187, included establishing intelligence-agents-inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and negotiating for British help in contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. "The British want to know, 'how serious are you?', before risking their assets to help the U.S.". "..(00180-00187)

"CIA has initiated action to contaminate POL supplies for Cuba, although visible results (stopage of some Cuban transports) is not expected until mid-1962. CIA is introducing *lubzol*, a corrosive additive to Cuban locomotive diesel fuel oil through commercial suppliers in Beligium. A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.

Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which will permit-provocative actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks are for each of the entitities involved then follows in Lansdale's memo. The memorandum notes that the President directed that the Chief of Operations conduct the project through the appropriate organizations and departments of the government. In this regard the memo notes "Also, CIA apparently believes that its role should be to create and expand a popular

In regard to Task #7 of General Lansdale's review this memo notes, "Moreover, the development of a resisitence movement will not remain controllable, so that operational time tables produced during the next four weeks can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of actions." (00107)

The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for inside Cuba have been assessed in depth. Fifteen locations have been selected-as-suitable-centers for resistence. It was also noted that in support of State's efforts, CIA has conducted pro- paganda operations including a number of mass demonstrations in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil Chile, Columbia Costa Rica Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

OCCURRENCE: The planning for Operation MONGOOSE was prepared on a format of separate planning for each department and agency involved. Revised planning along that line was submitted with this memorandum. Activities already approved were marked with an asterisk. Approved were dispatching one intelligence agent operation to a key area selected by the CIA, ("Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained for paramilitary skills as well as intelligence collection,...However, CIA has noted that, once the agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort will be made to attempt such control.")

The CIA has agreed as a matter of priority to reach a stage in the interrogation of Pedro Roig where he can be surfaced (to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin American nations). For operational effectiveness, the CIA has selected a new area in Cuba for its initial radio broadcasts from a submarine for "Voice of Cuba." The Navy states that the new area is feasible and State has concurred in the theme and content of the broadcast. They will take place around the end of the month. No proposals for actions by the Department of State have been submitted since the appointment of State's special representative, Mr. Hurwitch. They are expected on June 22, 1962.

OCCURRENCE: As to Phase I, CIA staff personnel up to 477 are devoting full time to this effort. "A very large number of additional personnel are devoting part time efforts to Operation MONGOOSE." Hard intelligence coverage of Cuba has been developed. Fifty-nine controlled agents inside of Cuba exist. Not so successful on infiltrating intelligence reporting in resistence cadre teams. Failure to meet the original schedule of team in-filtrations primarily-was-due-to-two-factors: "(a)-Lack-of-policy-approval-by-higher authority to make any extensive utilization of Department of Defense personnel and support." "Had we been permitted to mount a more intensive and agressive, the original infilitration schedule probably would have been met, possibly exceeded." The speed and extent of future infiltration teams for resisitence purposes into Cuba "will of course depend upon policy approvals by higher authority and the amount of support we can count on thereunder." "It is our opinion that there is an excellent chance such a revolt could be incited

OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning (NSA) cover. The memo alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about NSA cover for the Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority. It indicated that this was not possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence Board. The problem seemed to be to be able to decide how much of NSA (National Security Agency) assets were needed to provide cover for the Cuban project.

These broadcasts were to be attributed "such that Cubans would be talking to Cubans" and the broadcasting equipment would not be adequate to reach other parts of Latin America. However, DULLES pointed out "we are using the capability to place unattributed propaganda and publications throughout the area..."

"It was recognized that any radio broadcasting from Venezuela would undoubtedly be used by DR to further his fight with TRUJILLO, but the group agreed that this was not necessarily a drawback."

The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of July.

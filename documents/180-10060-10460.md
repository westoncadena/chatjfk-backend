Congressman Robert Edgar

Washington, D.C.

Dear Congressman Edgar:

On your recent trip to Canada, Mel Kreidman did not realize that under the House Rules, we cannot reimburse him for expenses paid for another.

Consequently, we prepared a voucher for $75.00 in your name for the expenses paid by Kreidman.

When you receive the check, you should endorse it over to Kreidman so that he will be reimbursed.

Have your office give me a call if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

![Signature of Thomas Howarth]

10 December 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group

SUBJECT: Promotion of Mr. Calvin W. Hicks

1. I would solicit Career Management Group and the Promotion Panel to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the current cycle of promotions from GS-13 to GS-14.

2. After Mr. Hicks EOD in 1950, he advanced rapidly in three years to GS-11. He was promoted to GS-12 in 1956, six years later to GS-13 in 1962, and since then has been almost 12 years in grade. He has had overseas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served as a training instructor, on a PM task force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in WII. In these assignments he consistently received Strong ratings. Despite a largely paramilitary background, in 1967 he adjusted to the intelligence production cycle and developed the skills of an operations officer doing operations-oriented reports work in the Intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest continuity in' the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful Individual who exercises excellent professional judgment. He was recommended for promotion from GS-13 to GS-14 in April 1968 and in April 1969. In 1970 he was recommended for a QSI by FI Chief, Peer deSilva. He was again recommended for promotion in March 1971, In November 1972, and in November 1973.

3. Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are relative and must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of his career would seem to argue the equity of granting the often recommended promotion to Mr. Calvin Hicks as he nears the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is 49 years old and has a family of five children. He has a medical hold which will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contemplates retirement at age 50 (in late 1974). He is and will be until then a valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.

4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

L. A. Campbell
Chief, Operations Staff

13 November 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Career Management Group

Mid-Career Officer Branch

SUBJECT : Recommendation for the Promotion of Calvin W. Hicks (056361)
to 6S-14

1. I would again like to recommend the promotion of subject officer from
   GS-13 to GS-14. Mr. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967
   and his performance has been characterized consistently by exceptional proficiency.
   He serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers doing identical work,
   some of whom are currently in GS-14.

2. A medical hold has precluded any further overseas assignments and for
   this reason his stay in IW has been extended until November 1974, when he will
   be 50-years-old at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement
   system.

3. Mr. Hicks' resourcefulness and ability to apply the multitude of
   reporting instructions and techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in
   crisis situations such as the recent Chilean coup and the Middle-Eastern crisis.
   He has consistently displayed initiative and good judgment in meeting unforeseen
   crisis with rapid and effective action and has clearly demonstrated his ability
   to continuously adjust to rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.

4. For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received
   a quality step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which
   he is held by his superiors. He occupies a GS-14 slot. His promotion is again
   recommended in recognition of his long years of Agency service.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Operations Staff

SUBJECT: Appreciation of IW Performance During Chilean Upheaval

1. The officers of the Intelligence Watch (IW) performed admirably in swiftly processing the heavy flow of intelligence engendered by the recent political upheaval in Chile. In many instances, reports were in the hands of customers in the intelligence community within minutes of being filed in Santiago.

2. Please extend to the IW officers concerned the appreciation of this Division for their fine performance. I suggest that a copy of this memorandum be placed in the personnel folder of each of the officers concerned.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence Staff

SUBJECT: Intelligence Watch Assistance to European Division

1. As I am preparing to leave the European Division, a note of appréciation is in order for the services rendered to us for the four years of my tenure here by the officers of the Intelligence Watch.

2. At a time of increasingly complicated intelligence collection and reporting problems, our Agency has come of age. We have recognized that information often cannot be allowed to wait for attention until sunrise, and that we must be able to respond to national needs and world events rround the clock. The Intelligence Watch, more than any other single institution, has made it possible for us to do this. We have benefited from its cooperation particularly under strained reporting conditions -- during Presidential. trips abroad, for instance -- but have also found IW's presence and judgment helpful at other times. I know that my staff relied on IW extensively.

3. I am making a point of recognizing this because the Intelligence Watch -- a bit like our Agency as a whole -- is apt to get more attention with an occasional slip than with a record of continuing accomplishment and success in coping with problems. From what I have been able to observe, the job has been well done.

4. I hope you will bring this memorandum to the attention of those concerned.

MEMORANDUM FOR: SECRETARY, CSPS/SECTION A

SUBJECT: RECOMMENDATION FOR THE PROMOTION OF CALVIN W. HICKS (056361) TO GS-14

1.  I RECOMMEND THE PROMOTION OF SUBJECT OFFICER FROM GS-13 TO GS-14. MR. HICKS HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH/FI STAFF SINCE JUNE 1967 AND SERVES ON A ROTATING SCHEDULE WITH SEVEN OTHER OFFICERS DOING IDENTICAL WORK, FOUR OF WHOM ARE CURRENTLY IN GRADE GS-14.

2.  MR. HICKS HAS BEEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH (IW) FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS AND HIS WORK, BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY, HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY OF A VERY HIGH CALIBER.

3.  HIS KEENLY DEVELOPED SENSE OF OPERATIONAL SECURITY RESULTING FROM HIS EXTENSIVE PARAMILITARY EXPERIENCE, COUPLED WITH HIS CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE, HAS MADE HIM A VERY FINE OFFICER AND A VALUABLE ASSET TO IW. HE HAS BEEN UNDER MY SU-PLRVISION FOR 18 MONTHS AND I HAVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE HIS PERFORMANCE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS. HE VERY ABLY APPLIES A MULTITUDE OF DETAIL AND GENERAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS MANIFEST IN EACH INCOMING REPORT AND DISPLAYS INITIATIVE IN MEETING UN-FORESEEN CRISES WITH RAPID AND EFFECTIVE ACTION. SINCE THE INTELLIGENCE .NFORMATION IS THE FACE THAT THE CLANDESTINE SERVICE PUTS OUT TO THE IN-TELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WATCH OFFICERS IS OF GREAT ¡MPORTANCE. THIS FACTOR BECOMES APPARENT WHEN IT IS NOTED THAT OVER 75 PERCENT OF ALL CABLED INTELLIGENCE REPORTS ARE DISSEMINATED BY IW.

4.  MR. HICKS HAS AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS BOTH IN THE FIELD AND AT HEADQUARTERS. ALL OF HIS FITNESS REPORTS FOR THE SIX YEARS PRECEDING HIS ASSIGNMENT TO IW HAVE BORNE THE OVERALL RATING OF "STRONG." HE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "HIGHLY MOTIVATED, SINCERE, AND, CAPABLE. ALSO, "HE WORKS WELL WITH OTHERS AND HIS KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY ARE RESPECTED." OTHER SUPERVISORS DURING THE YEARS PRIOR TO THIS ASSIGN-FMENT HAVE DESCRIBED HIM AS "SERIOUS, HARD-WORKING AND DEPENDABLE." HIS PERFORMANCE IN HIS PRESENT ASSIGNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THESE SAME QUALI-TIES.

5.  MR. HICKS IS A DISTINCT ASSET TO IW AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIS FOR PROMOTION TO GS-14.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDP QSI and Honor and Merit Awards Panel

SUBJECT: Request for Quality Step Increase
Mr. Calvin W. HICKS, GS-13 (056361)

1. I recommend that a Quality Step Increase be awarded to Mr. Calvin W. Hicks.

2. Mr. Hicks is one of three officers in the Intelligence Watch, FI Staff, on whom identical recommendations are being submitted. These officers, all in grade GS-13, have for several years done responsible and demanding work, identical to that done in the same office by five other officers, GS-14 and 15, and all three have been rated "Strong."

3. The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence dissemination office of the Clandestine Service. Its output of over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product of CS collection operations. Watch Officers serve on a rotating schedule. When an officer draws the night shift he serves alone. He must make quick, independent dissemination décisions. Mr. Hicks has done well at this work. He is alert and conscientious and has a sharp operational sense which is extremely useful in the handling of CS intelligence information. He has been recommended several times for promotion to GS-14.

4. The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has continued for more than two years. There is no reason to expect any decline in it. His enthusiasm continues, and his tour has recently been extended for another two years.

5. Consideration has been given to recommending him for an Honor and Merit Award, but on balance I believe that a Quality Step Increase would be more appropriate.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI Staff

SUBJECT: Performance of the Intelligence Watch During the President's Trip to Europe

1. Now that the President's trip to Europe has been concluded, I feel that a special commendation for the Intelligence Watch (IW) is in order.

2. The contribution that is being made by the officers in the Intelligence Watch is often taken for granted. Thus it was natural for us, when we formed our task force for the President's trip, to build our arrangements for positive intelligence dissemination around the IW's twenty-four-hour-a-day availability. We were not disappointed. The system worked smoothly and efficiently.

3. In addition to that, it became clear that the Intelligence Watch officers were willing and able to go beyond the simple call of duty. We came to admire their competence, courtesy, and cooperation, without which effective intelligence coverage would have been immeasurably more difficult. Since the IW's were working under an unusual strain, caused by the simultaneous outbreak of crises in different parts of the world, their performance is that much more to be commended.

4. Please convey our appreciation to all officers who had a part in this fine effort.

9 April 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSPS/Section A

SUBJECT: Recommendation for the promotion of Calvin W. Hicks (056361) to GS-14

1. I recommend the promotion of subject officer from GS-13 to GS-14. Mr. Hicks has been assigned to the Intelligence Watch/FI Staff since June 1967, and serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers doing identical work, five of whom are currently in Grade GS-14.

2. Mr. Hicks has been with IW for almost two years and his work, both quantitatively and qualitatively has been consistently of a very high caliber. Normally six months are required before an officer newly assigned to the Intelligence Watch is able to handle a shift by himself. At least a year is required before a Watch Officer can perform at a high level of proficiency. However, in the case of this officer, in a little more than a year he had earned the rating of "Strong" and has maintained it ever since. Although most of his Agency experience had been in para- military operations, he adapted quickly to the demands of his new assign- ment. His keenly developed sense of operational security, coupled with his clear understanding of the relationship between operations and intelligence, has made him a very fine officer and a valuable asset to IW. He has been under my supervision for 16 months and I have had ample opportunity to observe his performance under conditions of stress. He is even tempered and level headed. His mistakes are few and infrequent and these are usually of the clerical variety, not in matters of judgment. I continue to be impressed with his thoroughness in handling information; with the evidence of his coordination when the interests of more than one division are involved. Since operations have to be submerged and the intelligence is the portion of the iceberg which shows to the intelligence community, the performance of the Watch Officers is of great importance. This factor becomes apparent when it is noted that about 80% of all cabled intelligence reports are disseminated by the Intelligence Watch. Recently the Watch Officers were commended by the Chief, FI Staff and the Chief, Europe Division for their performance during the President's trip to Western Europe. The simultaneous outbreak of crises in different parts of the world further added to the burdens of the Watch Office at that time. Mr. Hicks made a real contribution during that period and deserves the commendation personally in a high degree.

3. Prior to his assignment to the Intelligence Watch, Mr. Hicks served with WH Division and with the Cuban Operation. He has an extensive background in paremilitary operations both in the field and at headquarters. All of his Fitness Reports for the six years preceding his assignment to the Intelligence Watch have borne the overall rating of "strong." He has been described as "highly motivated" "sincere and capable." lie has been further complimented as "working well with others .. and his knowledgo and ability are respected." Other supervisors. have described him as "serious, hard-working and dependable." His performance in his present assignment has demonstrated these same qualities. He has managed the transition from active operations to the life of a desk bound intelligence officer with ease. I recommend him with enthusiasm for promotion to GS-14.

1. I RECOMMEND THE PROMOTION OF SUBJECT OFFICER FROM GS-13 TO GS-14. MR. HICKS HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH/ FI STAFF SINCE JUNE 1967, WHERE HE SERVES ON A ROTATING SCHEDULE WITH SEVEN OTHER OFFICERS DOING IDENTICAL WORK; FIVE OF WHOM ARE CURRENTLY IN GRADE GS-14.

2. MR. HICKS HAS BEEN WITH IW FOR ABOUT 16 MONTHS AND HIS WORK, BOTH QUANTITAVELY AND QUALITATIVELY, HAS SEEN CONSISTENTLY OF VERY HIGH CALIBER. NORMALLY SIX MONTHS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE AN OFFICER NEWLY ASSIGNED TO THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH IS ABLE TO HANDLE A SHIFT BY HIMSELF. AT LEAST A YEAR IS USUALLY REQUIRED BEFORE A MAN CAN ADVANCE FROM "ADEQUATE" TO "PROFICIENT." AT PRESENT, MR. HICKS HAS ALREADY PROGRESSED TO THE RATING OF "STRONG." HE IS ALERT AND CONSCIENTIOUS AND HAS AN OPERATIONAL SENSE WHICH IS IN- VALUABLE IN THE HANDLING OF INTELLIGENCE.. WITH HIS EXTENSIVE OPERATIONAL AND PARAMILITARY BACKGROUND, MR. HICKS HAS A FINE SENSE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPERATIONS AND ITS PRIMARY PRODUCT, THE CLANDESTINE SERVICES INTELLIGENCE REPORT. THIS OF- FICER HAS BEEN UNDER MY SUPERVISION FOR 11 MONTHS AND DURING THAT PERIOD I HAVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE HIS CONDUCT UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS. HE IS EVEN TEMPERED AND LEVEL HEADED. HIS MISTAKES ARE FEW AND INFREQUENT. I AM PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH HIS THOROUGHNESS IN HANDLING INFORMATION; WITH THE EVIDENCE OF THE COORDINATION WHICH HE SO OFTEN ATTEMPTS WITH SEVERAL AREA DIVISIONS WHEN NECESSARY BEFORE DISSEMINATING A REPORT TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. SINCE THE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION RE- PORT IS THE FACE THAT THE CLANDESTINE SERVICES SHOWS TO THE IN- TELLIGENCE ANALYST AND THE POLICY OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WATCH OFFICERS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. TH.S FACTOR BECOMES APPARENT WHEN ONE NOTES THAT ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF ALL CABLED INTELLIGENCE REPORTS ARE DISSEMINATED BY THE INTELLI- GENCE WATCH.

I heartily endorse this recommendation that Mr. Hicks be
promoted to GS-14. As his supervisor points out, Mr. Hicks,
when he came to the Intelligence Watch, was essentially a
querrilla warfare field operational officer. Positive intelli-
gence information reporting and the handling of reports were
new to him, and called for professional skills and other
qualities radically different from those which most of his
previous experience had brought into play. Yet in a relatively
short time, Mr. Hicks has developed the skills required of a
Watch Officer, and thanks to this and to other strengths has
become one of the most valuable officers in the unit.

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-13
- Mr. Calvin W. Hicks

1. It is recommended that Calvin W. Hicks be promoted from Grade GS-12 to Grade GS-13 in recognition of his outstanding performance as a member of JMATE Project.

2. Mr. Hicks was assigned to JMATE Project in October 1960 as an operations officer in the Paramilitary Section. His years of Agency experience and varied operational assignments enabled him to immediately take hold and perform the many functions required in the Paramilitary Operations Section in a most outstanding wanner. This included recruitment, training, briefing, debriefing and in-exfiltration of agents; supervision of the infiltration of supplies and bodies by air for the Paramilitary Operations Section; case officer for certain high level agents and their W/T operators inside the target area. Mr. Hicks' maturity, common sense and varied experience enabled him to operate with the minimum of supervision. He trained certain agents in trade-craft, air and maritime reception, mapping, and guerrilla warfare with the result that these agents received the only completely successful air drops. In addition, some of these agents handled and trained by Mr. Hicks became our most trusted and important. agenta, and a large measure of their willingness to go on after continued frustrations was due to their respect for, and trust and confidence in, Mr: Hicks.

3. Mr. Hicks has continuously demonstrated the ability to perform duties in a higher grade. He has the leadership, maturity, common sense, stability, and ability to wake decisions and to operate with minimum supervision so necessary to senior officers in the Agency. He is aggressive and capable of fighting for his views; at the same time he will listen to advice and once a decision has been handed down, will give it his full support even though he might have opposed it before the decision was made.

Ir. Cete significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated intent position-keeping in proper perspective their overall performance. State suggestions on foreign for improvement of employee performance. Give recommendations for training.

explain training given in Section to provide basis for determining future personnel action.

Attach o separate sheet of paper.

Mr. Hicks continues to perform with exceptional proficiency. In April 1972 he was granted a Quality Step Increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which he is held by his supervisor in the Glandestine Service.

Mr. Hicks' services have been particularly valuable during this reporting period because of DDP's increased concern regarding the strict maintenance of operational security in the dissemination of its intelligence information. Mr. Hicks has been instrumental in referring many reports when in the opinion of Ill officers, the authentication statement and the manner in which the report is written would help to pinpoint the source of the information if the report fell in unauthorized hands. Mr. Hicks notations on the IW log cards which record the action taken on each report indicate the seriousness in which Mr. Hicks approaches his daily tasks and his contributions in reminding Divisional personnel about the essential elements of good reporting and the need to comply with the prescribed format.

The exercise of good judgment in referring or consulting on an Intel Cable prior to its dissemination to the Intelligence Community is an essential element in the proper functioning of this office and upon which depends to a certain extent the Agency's reputation.

With the retirement and reassignment of several IW officers during this reporting period, Mr. Hicks is now the IW officer with the most experience and continuity on the job. This together with his maturity of judgment and ability to withstand the rigors and pressures inherent in an around-the-clock activity, make Mr. Hicks a distinct asset in the unit.

The assignment carries no supervisory responsibilities and does not require any demonstration-of-cost-consciousness.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

SUBJECT: Credit Reference for Mr. Calvin W. Hicks

1. Mr. Calvin W. Hicks has had the following history of employment with the Agency:

a. August 1950- EOD Headquarters

b. December 1950-April 1952 - FE Division, stationed overseas

c. April 1952-March 1954 - OTR, Headquarters.

d. March 1954-May 1955 - OTR, ISOLATION

During his time at Headquarters he was a student and did not establish credit. While overseas, his cover was that of a Department of the Army civilian, although he told casual friends that he had been recalled to active duty. From April 1952 to March 1954, he used a nominal cover of a Department of Defense civilian. He used the Commanding Officer of ISOLATION (as locally known) to establish credit there.

2. Mr. Hicks will abide by the above story. Therefore, he should admit no affiliation with the Agency, and his employment with the Agency will be denied.

During this reporting period Mr. Hicks' performance has continued to be characterized by exceptional proficiency. The record is already replete of laudatory comments regarding his performance not only in IW but in previous assignments. Mr. Hicks is retiring from the Agency at the end of this year on a medical disability. Since his assignment to IW, 7 1/2 years ago, he has had a medical hold and because of his deep roted motivation and strong belief in the Agency's mission, he has held on tenaciously until he reached the age of 50. In addition to being a very effective IW officer throughout these years, Mr. Hicks has also performed in a superior manner as a paramilitary officer during the early years of his career, overseas and in Headquarters. We wish him Godspeed, and our best wishes for good health throughout the coming years.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section C to provide best basis for determining future personnel action: Manner, of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment, and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section D, attach a separate sheet of paper.

There has been no change in Mr. Hicks' performance from the last reporting period. It is still characterized by exceptional proficiency. He continues to display initiative, resourcefulness and good judgment in the performance of the duties assigned to an IW officer.

Mr. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967. A medical hold has precluded any further overseas assignments and for this reason his tour in IW has been extended until he reaches age 50 (November 1974) at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement system. Throughout this period he has continuously applied himself with diligence and enthusiasm. Even after some protracted sick leave periods he has returned ready to step in and pick up where he left off which is the best proof of his mastery of details and the mechanics of dissemination, as well as his ability to adjust to the stresses, and strains resulting from this type of assignment.

Since the inception of his IW assignment he has borne the same responsibilities and carried the same burdens as his colleagues in the GS-14 category and continues to perform at this level. For this sustained high-level of performance in 1972 he received a quality step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which he is held by his superiors.

Mr. Hicks' resourcefulness and ability to apply the myriad of reporting skills and techniques has been clearly demonstrated in crisis situations such as the recent Chilean political upheaval and the current Near Eastern crisis. The presence of IW officers such as Mr. Hicks enables the DDO to effect electrical dissemination of the high precedence traffic to the Intelligence Community in a matter of minutes on a 24-hour-day basis. He carries no supervisory responsibilities he gives all indications of being cost conscious.

Mr. Hicks continues to perform with exceptional proficiency. In April 1972 he was granted a Quality Step Increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which he is held by his supervisor in the Clandestine Service.

Mr. Hicks' services have been particularly valuable during this reporting period because of DDP's increased concern regarding the strict maintenance of operational security in the dissemination of its intelligence information. Mr. Hicks has been instrumental in referring many reports when in the opinion of IW officers, the authentication statement and the manner in which the report is written would help to pinpoint the source of the information if the report fell in unauthorized hands. Mr. Hicks notations on the IW log cards which record the action taken on each report indicate the seriousness, in which Mr. Hicks, approaches his daily tasks and his contributions in reminding Divisional personnel about the essential elements of good reporting and the need to comply with the prescribed format.

The exercise of good judgment in referring or consulting on an Intel Cable prior to its dissemination to the Intelligence Community is an essential element in the proper functioning of this office and upon which depends to a certain extent the Agency's reputation.

With the retirement and reassignment of several IW officers during this reporting period, Mr. Hicks is now the IW officer with the most experience and continuity on the job. This together with his maturity of judgment and ability to withstand the rigors and pressures inherent in an around-the-clock activity, make Mr. Hicks a distinct asset in the unit.

The assignment carries no supervisory responsibilities and does not require any significant demonstration of cost consciousness.

MR. HICKS' PERFORMANCE DURING THE 35 MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION HAS CONTINUED AT THE SAME HIGH LEVEL NOTED IN HIS LAST FITNESS REPORT. HE EXERCISES GREAT CARE AND ATTENTION TO THE MULTITUDE OF DETAILS DETAILED IN THE PROCESSING OF INTEL CABLES. HE WORKS WELL UNDER PRESSURE AND IS CONGENIAL AND TACTFUL IN DEALING WITH DIVISIONAL PERSONNEL.

HIS TOUR IN IW WILL BE EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. HIS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN IW WILL BE OF INESTIMABLE VALUE TO NEW OFFICERS WHO WILL BE JOINING THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH AS OTHERS ARE REASSIGNED OR RETIRE.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT HE BE RECONSIDERED FOR PROMOTION TO GS-14, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT HE HAS BEEN PERFORMING AT THIS LEVEL FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME.

There has been frequent consultation with Mr. Hicks concerning his performance of his duties. He has no supervisory duties and is cost-conscious.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I do not know Mr. Hicks well having been assigned to the FI staff only a relatively short period of time, plus the fact that direct contacts with officers of the Intelligence Watch are not always frequent owing to their schedules. I would concur however in the rating and narrative comments above in view of my knowledge of the supervisors.

MR. HICKS HAS BEEN A WATCH OFFICER IN IW FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND IS A DEPENDABLE AND THOROUGHLY RELIABLE MEMBER OF THE TEAM. HE HAS A FINE OPERATIONAL BACKGROUND AND A KEEN SENSE OF SECURITY. HIS JUDGMENT IS VERY SOUND AND HE FAR EXCEEDS THE DEMANDS OF HIS POSITION IN THE EXTENT OF HIS COORDINATION WITH THE AREA DIVISIONS ON MATTERS WHERE HE FEELS THAT DIVISION JUDGMENT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON AN INTELL CABLE. HE IS METICULOUSLY CORRECT IN HIS APPROACH TO HIS DUTIES AND KNOWS HOW TO BALANCE CUSTOMER NEED FOR ENLIGHTENMENT ON SOURCES TO THE AGENCY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCE PROTECTION. HE STANDS UP WELL UNDER PRESSURE, IS COOPERATIVE AND CONGENIAL. HE HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION TO GS-14 THREE TIMES DURING HIS TOUR IN IW AND IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO PROMOTE HIM. HIS PERFORMANCE IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF HIS COLLEAGUES WHO ARE IN GRADE GS-14. NEITHER COST CONSCIOUSNESS NOR SUPERVISION IS A FACTOR IN HIS PERFORMANCE.

Mr. Hicks has been with In for almost 2 years and is a dependable and thoroughly reliable member of the team. He brings to his work a fine operational background and a sense of operational security which is of great assistence in the exercise of sound judgment on dissemination matters. He has an instinct for prompt recognition of problem cases and is imaginative in his approach to problems of under-enlightenment of the reader and the opposite extreme of lax source protection.

He is careful and meticulous in his work, level headed and sound in his judgments. He knows how to balance the customer demand for speed and enlightenment against the equally important demands for source protection. He stands up well under pressure, is cooperative and congenial with his colleagues and with the divisional personnel with whom he is in contact.

Neither cost consciousness nor supervision is a factor in his performance.

I concur in this report primarily on the basis of my confidence in the judgment of the supervisor, as I have had no opportunity to evaluate closely the performance of individual officers in the Intelligence Watch. Such direct contacts as I have had with Mr. Hicks have tended to confirm the overall rating of "Strong." I am satisfied that he is performing at the GS-14 level.

State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action.

If extra space is needed to complete Section C attach a separate sheet of paper. MR. HICKS CONTINUES TO TURN IN AN EXCELLENT ALL-AROUND PERFORMANCE. HE EXERCISES A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN CARRYING OUT HIS DUTIES. HE IS ALERT, CONSCIENTIOUS, STRONG-WILLED, AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT VERY PLEASANT IN DEALING WITH PEOPLE OF ALL LEVELS.

BECAUSE OF HIS CONSTANT AWARENESS THAT CS REPORTS MAY FALL IN UNAUTHORIZED HANDS, MR. HICKS HAS BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE IN MAINTAINING SECURITY DISCIPLINE IN THE REVIEW OF THE INTEL CABLES, PARTICULARLY THE AUTHENTICATION STATEMENTS TO INSURE THAT ANY DATA WHICH MAY PRESENT A SECURITY HAZARD TO THE SOURCE IS OMITTED FROM THE DISSEMINATION OF THE INFORMATION.

MR. HICKS HAS BEEN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH SINCE JUNE 1967. HIS OVERALL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY CHARACTERIZED BY EXCEPTIONAL PROFICIENCY. HE HAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEEN PERFORMING DUTIES COMMENSURATE WITH A GRADE HIGHER THAN HIS PRESENT ONE. A CONCERTED EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO PROMOTE HIM TO A GS-14. HE HAS BEEN PUT IN FOR PROMOTION AS AN INTELLIGENCE WATCH OFFICER SINCE 1968.

WITH THE RETIREMENT AND REASSIGNMENT OF SEVERAL IW OFFICERS, BY NEXT YEAR, HE WILL BE THE IW OFFICER WITH THE MOST CONTINUITY ON THE JOB. THIS WILL BE A GREAT ASSET TO IW AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE NEWER OFFICERS WHO WILL PROFIT FROM HIS EXPERIENCE.

ATTACHED TO THIS FITNESS REPORT IS A RECENTLY PREPARED POSITION DESCRIPTION OF AN IW OFFICER WHICH CHARACTERIZES MR. HICKS IN EVERY RESPECT. THIS DESCRIPTION SHOULD HELP TO BETTER APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE THAT THE DDP ATTACHES TO THE FUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF IW OFFICERS AS WELL AS THE SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE WORK.

IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND SUITABLE OFFICERS TO SERVE IN IW. IT CALLS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED, WITH MATURITY OF JUDGMENT, TEMPERAMENT, MANNER AND BEARING TO WITHSTAND THE RIGORS OF SHIFT WORK, AND ABOVE ALL TO MAINTAIN CORDIAL RELATIONS.

MR. HICKS' TENURE IN IW HAS BEEN TOWARD A REAL EVALUATION OF HIS PERFORMANCE. NORMALLY, AN EXPERIENCED OFFICER REQUIRES THREE MONTHS ON-THE-JOB TRAINING PLUS ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME ON SHIFT BEFORE HE IS READY TO COPE, WITHOUT STRONG SUPPORT OR SUPERVISION, WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT. MR. HICKS JOINED THE UNIT ON 5 JUNE, COMPLETED A SHORTENED OJT PERIOD AND HAS BEEN ON SHIFT ONLY SINCE LATE SUMMER. HE HAS APPLIED HIMSELF WITH DILIGENCE TO LEARNING THE PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES OF TD DISSEMINATIONS FROM CABLED FIELD INFORMATION REPORTS. ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCED OPERATIONALLY, HE HAS QUITE NATURALLY LACKED THE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS JOB REQUIRES. HE HAS MADE VERY GRATIFYING PROGRESS, BUT HE STILL MUST MASTER KNOWLEDGE IN DEPTH PECULIAR TO THE IW FUNCTION; WHILE I HAVE NO DOUBTS THAT HE CAN HANDLE ROUTINE DISSEMINATION MATTERS WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY, AND SOME "PROBLEM" DISSEMINATION CASES, HE HAS YET TO MEET A REAL CRISIS SITUATION WHEN HE IS ON DUTY BY HIMSELF. I THINK HE HAS MOVED FROM ADEQUACY OF PERFORMANCE TO PROFICIENCY--IT BEING VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE TWO--AND HE IS LARGELY BEYOND THE POINT WHERE HE NEEDS CLOSE SUPERVISION. HE WILL PROBABLY BE A STRONG OFFICER GIVEN TIME. HE HAS ADAPTED WELL TO THE PRESSURES OF THIS ASSIGNMENT AND APPEARS TO HAVE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STAMINA TO WITHSTAND ITS RIGORS. HE IS EXTREMELY CONSCIENTIOUS AND VERY ACCOMMODATING IN ACCEPTING SCHEDULE CHANGES NECESSITATED BY THE ILLNESS OR ABSENCE OF HIS FELLOW OFFICERS. HE GETS ALONG WELL WITH CABLE SECRETARIAT PERSONNEL, WITH WHOM IW MUST WORK VERY CLOSELY, BECAUSE OF AN OUTGOING AND FRIENDLY PERSONALITY. HE RESPONDS WELL TO DIRECTION. I AM SURE THAT HIS COOPERATIVE ATTITUDE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMOOTH OPERATION OF THE OFFICE. THIS ASSIGNMENT CARRIES NO SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY SIGNIFICANT DEMONSTRATION OF COST CONSCIOUSNESS.

TRAINING REPORT

(3-69)
MANAGERIAL GRID SEMINAR (50 hours) DATES: 2-7 February 1969
Student : Calvin W. Hicks Cffice : FI
Year of Birth: 1924 Service Designation: D
Grade : GS-13 No. of Students : 43
ECD Date : July 1958

COURSE CBJECTIVES AND METHOD

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Custure and Development.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense. In Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly assessed, Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.

Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might change his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves.

About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in this course.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

NOTE: This report covers the period from 10 August 1966 to 15 January 1967 during which time Mr. Hicks worked of the Colombia Desk. This report is being submitted because of reassignment of the rating officer.

Although Mr. Hicks is an experienced officer with strong qualifications and abilities, it should be noted that some aspects of his present job were a new experience for him, since his past experience has been entirely in the PM field. However, Mr. Hicks adapted well and quickly to the new environment, showed a great deal of initiative and resourcefulness in familiarizing himself with the work, and by bringing sound operational and administrative experience to bear, carried out his duties in a thoroughly competent manner. He demonstrated uncommon ability to organize his work, anticipate problems or requirements, and take effective action promptly. In dealings with his associates he exércisod a good balance of persuasiveness and friendliness which paid dividends in terms of getting a job done. He can be relied on absolutely to carry out a given task promptly and well.

I would welcome any occasion which permitted Mr. Hicks to work with me again.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Mr. Hicks is a mature and thoughtful individual who made the switch from PM to FI activities at his own volition. He was originally scheduled for a field assignment to a WH Station in the fall of 1966, but for medical reasons will probably be staying at Headquarters for some time. While this restriction may limit his ability to get that feel for FI field operations which a Headquarters desk officer should have, he has previous field experience in a PM capacity to compensate for this.

LANGUAGE TRAINING OBJECTIVES AND METHODS

The general aims of language training are attainment of proficiency in speaking, understanding, reading and writing. The specific objectives are (1) ability to produce and distinguish the sounds of the language; (2) ability to use a stock of basic sentences and expressions; (3) ability to recombine the elements of basic sentences and expressions and to apply them to new situations; (4) ability to comprehend the language spoken at normal speed in various situations; (5) ability to write and read the language commensurate with ability to speak.

Methods used in all courses stress oral drills and free conversation based at first on memorized material and, at a later stage, on varied reading materials. written and oral tests are given at intervals. Listening to and recording on tapes in the Language Lab is essential for class preparation.

He strives hard to do a good job and is most anxious to please his superiors. He is aggressive and conscientious in carrying out his functions; strong-willed and persistent in seeking to achieve his goals; Straightforward but pleasant in dealing with colleagues and other Government officials: determined in resisting encroachments in his area of authority: and finally he is motivated by strong patriotic ideals.

He is well-informed and competent in paramilitary operations with a particular gift for ferreting out technical improvements and innovations, and bringing them to bear on operations. Finally, Subject adapts smoothly and efficiently to operational and policy changes affecting his programs.

Mr. Hicks' primary responsibility has been to provide Headquarters support and guidance for the PM activities directed by the Miami Station against the Cuban target. Mr. Hicks has shown a high degree of professional judgment in carrying out his duties, and his judgment is respected by senior officials who are required to submit the PM programs for high-level approval. During operational phases of the PM programs, Mr. Hicks is frequently required to be on call to act on emergency situations on a 24-hour basis. He has accepted this responsibility willingly. He has consistently taken the initiative in investigating technical developments which might provide assistance to the Station in the conduct of PM operations. He now supervises two professional and two clerical employees in his Section and runs his unit smoothly with no discernible friction. He does a good job of briefing and indoctrinating junior officers. While his experience has been predominantly in the PM field, he has acquired FI experience in the last two years because of the unique nature of Cuban PM (FI) operations. In his consideration of budgetary matters, he has demonstrated an understanding of the need to curtail expenses, where feasible. I would be glad to have Mr. Hicks work with me at any future time.

SECTION C

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Mr. Hicks has an exceptional knowledge of and experience with the problems involved in the conduct and support of covert PM operations. He has shown a high degree of initiative in providing the training and other support required and in preparing material for staff presentation to higher echelons. His attention to detail is a strength in accomplishing his duties but he must try harder to overcome a tendency for too much detail in his staff communications, oral and written. His written work in particular shows a weakness in synthesizing which it is believed could be overcome by available courses of training. Mr. Hicks has also reached the point where he must broaden his outlook as to the wider political and operational implications of PM operations. To this end, it is intended that Mr. Hicks will attend the Inter-Agency Counterinsurgency Course in the near future. Under an experienced Chief of Operations, Mr. Hicks could handle PM operations at most Field Stations; in a major operation such as Viet Nam or Cuba, he could adequately handle a large segment such as PM Training, the handling of a large indigenous group, or the duties of Chief/PM Operations or Deputy Chief, PM. He would be a definite asset, in the field or at Hqs., in any type of task force operations.

COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHODS.

This course aims to develop in the Clandestine Services officers and others recently returned from the field an up-to-date awareness of the role of CIA in the United States intelligence community, the relations of the DDI and DDR areas with the CS, and the support available from the offices of the DDS.

The course is presented by lectures given by CIA officials who are directly responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services discussed. Each lecture is usually followed by a short question period. Approximately 10 per cent of the students' time is scheduled for reading pertinent up-to-date regulations and background summaries.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only; no attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in the course.

SECTION E

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position: Indicate suggestions made to employ for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Subject is one of the most practical, hard-headed, persistent, and competent operations and operations staff officers this supervisor has ever been in our organization. He fights tenaciously and resourcefully in support of his staff advice to the time his chief makes a decision; from that time on he gives 100% loyalty to his country, his organization, and his chief. His approach to plans and ops of the clandestine program has always been practical, and with the long-range requirements solidly in view. He is forceful and firm in dealing with Allied opposite numbers, at the same time earning and retaining their respect. He is skillful and persistent in eliciting intelligence information. His development of contacts in the country assigned has been surprisingly good, even though outside his assigned responsibilities; in other words, he has constantly exercised initiative to place himself in a position to collect intelligence information should the requirement be placed on him. Altogether an outstandingly fine operations and staff officer whom I shall always welcome on my staff. His training, experience, and demonstrated ability in the field all well demonstrate his qualification to fill assignments in the next higher grade.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

It is probably because of the isolated location of the base and the "togetherness" of its personnel but this rating officer as well as his predecessors have all rated on the high side. While my contacts with subject officer have been infrequent and any evaluation would largely be based on paper-work subject has originated my assessment is that subject is an average officer for his age, grade, and experience in his rather specialized field. In comparison with other officers I have known in this area.

Dear Mr. Hicks:

For your information and convenience, an Annuity Statement has been forwarded to you. That statement relates basically to the payment for the period 28 December 1974 through 28 February 1975.

Enclosed is a retiree identification card. Before using the document, please sign your name in ink on the reverse side of the card.

This office is in receipt of your signed statement wherein you elected to receive payment under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) in lieu of a retirement annuity under the CIA Retirement and Disability System. Accordingly, your annuity ceased as of 28 February 1975 and you will henceforth receive benefits under FECA. An adjustment will be made in the payment issued by FECA retroactive to 28 December 1974. If, at a later date, the determination is made that you are not permanently nor totally disabled, your FECA payments might by reduced or stopped, at which time you may request the initiation of your retirement annuity.

If you elect to receive an annuity instead of benefits under FECA, you must so advise the Office of Federal Employees' Compensation, indicating the date of this election. In addition, you should send a copy of your corre- spondence with that office to the Agency.

Sincerely yours,

Ronald Gage

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

VIA : DDP/OP

SUBJECT : Request for Quality Step Increase.
Mr. Calvin W. Hicks

1.  The GS-13 Evaluation Board for FY 1972, having carefully reviewed the performance or all officers in grade GS-13 according to the standards of HR 20-31a(3)(b), recommends Mr. Calvin W. Hicks for a Quality Step Increase.

2.  Mr. Hicks performed in a superior manner as a paramilitary officer during the early years of his career, overseas and in Headquarters. A medical hold on overseas duty led to his assignment in 1967 to the Intelligence Watch/FI Staff where he has remained up to the present. Mr. Hicks has received overall ratings of "Strong" from 1968 through 1971, with his performance characterized as exceptionally proficient. Of the seven officers with whom he serves on a rotating basis, four are GS-14's. The FI Staff has recommended Mr. Hicks for promotion in 1968, 1969, 1971 and 1972, with a recommendation for QSI in 1970. None of these recommendations were approved.

3.  The Board has noted that Mr. Hicks plans to retire in 1974 at the age of 50. In view of the very high regard in which he is held by the FI Staff; his record of sustained superior performance and his high dedication to the Agency, the Board recommends recognition in the form of a Quality Step Increase for Mr. Hicks.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Expression of Appreciation and Commendation for the Intelligence Watch.

1. I wish to express my appreciation and personal praise for the performance of the FI/Intelligence Watch during the height of the recent Middle East crisis. I am informed that the Arab-Israeli War and its aftermath were primary factors which resulted in the Watch processing for the month of June the highest number of disseminations since its establishment. The Watch was particularly helpful to this Division in ensuring that the dissemination of the reporting on the Middle East situation was not only rapidly disseminated locally to the Intelligence Community but also promptly relayed to interested overseas military commands and CIA field stations.

2. The judgment shown by Watch officers, often under trying circumstances, was invariably sound and helpful. The worth of the Watch, particularly during the crisis situation, was once more demonstrated to all of us in NE Division.

9 November 1960

1. This is a letter of commendation for Calvin W. Hicks for the period of 7 January - 25 August 1960. During this time he served under my command on the staff of ACLPVE. Project. His assignment was Operations Officer on the ACLFVea staff, and Chief Operations Officer for the United States clement of the Joint Operations Staff, serving oposite a like officer from the Allied service.

2. Hicks at all times was an outstanding member of the staff. He was zealous in his efforts to improve operational techniques to increase operational assets, and to insure that these assets were of trustworthy nature and were highly trained and qualified. His forerost thoughts were always centered on what was best for the interests of the United States. He was practical, unremitting in his efforts, and hard-headed in his analysis of how best to deal with the Allied partners for the best interests of the United States. He was a sound staff officer, offering sound operational advice to his commander, and always submitting staff work in completed form. After giving strong support to the courses of action recommended by him, he never failed to give complete support to his commander after a decision was made, even though it contravened the course he favored.

3. Mr. Hicks has been a GS-12 since November 1956. He has amply demonstrated his complete qualifications to perform the duties of the nest higher grade, and it is my conviction he has earned the right to early consideration for promotion.

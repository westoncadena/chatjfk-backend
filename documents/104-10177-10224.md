REF: LONDON 81224 IN 2003461 4

1. OBYEDKOV ACTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY, ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED TO BE BETTER EDUCATED THAN HIS DUTIES AS A GUARD WOULD DEMAND. AMONG HIS MAIN DUTIES, HE TENDED THE SOVIET EMBASSY TELEPHONE, STOOD GUARD DUTY AT THE GATE, TOOK MESSAGES FOR OTHER SOVIETS, NOTIFIED THEM OF MEETINGS, AND ARRANGED APPOINTMENTS. HE ALSO OCCASIONALLY DROVE ONE OF THE EMBASSY CARS ON ERRANDS. DURING HIS TEHRAN TOUR, HE WAS ALSO LISTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY. HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE VERY SECURITY CONSCIOUS. Y

2. ON BOTH PRECEDING TOURS OBYEDKOV APPEARED TO FUNCTION AS A LEGITIMATE GUARD AND WAS NEVER OBSERVED IN THE ACT OF PERFORMING ANY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE A SOVIET IS LISTED AS A GUARD AT A SOVIET EMBASSY, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE IS NECESSARILY A KGB OFFICER. SINCE WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION WE WILL NO LONGER CARRY HIM AS SUSPECT RIS, PROBABLY KGB.

MICROFILM

1. For your information, we no longer carry Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV (201-779495), guard at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, as PCS. He was not listed on ROGWEN's April 1971 Presence List nor their December 1971 list. We assume he has departed PCS.

2. During OBYEDKOV's tour in Tehran his wife, Yelena, served as principal at the Soviet school. His son was apparently in Moscow living with Yelena's mother. On 23 October 1969, ROARC reported the grandmother calling to check with OBYEDKOV regarding a tutor for the child. They discussed the possibility of the tutor coming for three times a week, at five rubles per hour, but OBYEDKOV, after checking with his wife, decided on two times a week. OBYEDKOV seemed to be very fond of his mother-in-law. According to our AESCREEN transcriber, she was the only one that could tell OBYEDKOV what to do.

3. The following are comments made by our AESCREEN transcriber on OBYEDKOV on 8 July 1970:

He is very security conscious, especially in dealing with "official people" or superiors. He mentions his name to his friends freely, but refuses to say his name when he knows that one of the superiors is calling, "this is the duty officer" OBYEDKOV would say several times. He often lectures people when they violate security regulations when talking on the telephone. OBYEDKOV has to be persuaded several times or even

begged if someone needs help (getting a vehicle or when asking for a favor), but when he decides to help, OBYEDKOV will stay with the problem until he gets results. Although OBYEDKOVA seems to be more cultured and better educated than her husband, it is certain that only OBYEDKOV makes the final decisions. OBYEDKOV could be very pleasant, helpful and even kind, but it usually depended on his mood.

5. The only Soviet we noted as being friendly with OBYEDKOV during his tour here was Rafik Nazhaf-Ogly ABDULLAYEV (201-808524), Third Secretary, suspect RIS, probable KGB. When speaking to one another they used the familiar "ty". We do not know the extent of their relationship.

4. Forwarded herewith is a photograph, date unknown, received from ROGWEN. We have destroyed the Station file.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1. Request traces on:

Ivan Dmitriyevicen OBYEDKOV (201-779415)
born 27 August 1927, Ryazan
passport: S-105042 issued 26 May 1967
wife: Yelena born 1923, Moscow
passport: S-105043 issued 26 May 1967
occupation: guard, Soviet Embassy, Tehran
arrived: 15 August 1967.

Photocopies of the OBYEDKOVS' passports are attached.

2. According to the 1963 and 1964 Checklists of Soviet Officials Abroad, one Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV (201-121531); born 14 July 1912; wire Yelena; A number 04377, was present in Mexico City since August 1962 as an employee of the Soviet Embassy. The. Checklist for 1965, lists one Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV (201-779495); born 14 July 1912; wife Yelena; A number 41970, as an employee of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City since August 1962. Apparently these two OBYEDKOVS are one in the same and although Subject's birthdate is different we believe he is identical with the OBYEDKOV who served in Mexico City. Recently a conversation was recorded on ROARC during waich Subject used several Spanish words and expressions. It is possible Subject acquired a knowledge of Spanish during a previous tour in a Spanish speaking country such as Mexico. Please compare the attached photo of Subject with that of the OBYEDKOV who was assigned to Mexico City to determine if they are identical.

1. Forwarded herewith are Suamary Traces in SPA format on Ivan Dmitriyevich DGYBUKOV (201-779495) who is suspect KIS. Paragraph 20 of the Summary is for passage to liaison.

2. Subject is not identical to Ivan Ivanovich OBYLDKOV (201-121531). When Subject first arrived in Mexico in August 1962, he was reported as Ivan Ivanovica and this orror was not corrected until May 1905; therefore, two Checklists carried the wrong an PCS in Mexico. When the records were corrected, the Subject's birthdate was not, and the same date was listed for both parties. Headquarters records do not list a wife or other dependents for Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV and, as far as is known, he has not been assigned abroad PCS prior to the date of this dispatch.

10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, AND HABITS:

Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, he appeared to be fairly well educated and was not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV. (201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy Stepanovich VISKO with her arithmetic homework. On another, Subject was asked about methods of producing metal wire, a subject on which Subject was well informed as a result of his having once worked for a wire factory.

Subject had a tape recorder at home which he liked to listen to. lle also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets..

Subject told "Boris" in Moscow to build a large garage, because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also asked whether Boris had bought a refrigerator and TV for the apartment. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can of paint to take back to Moscow with him to repaint "the Moskvich". Subject and his wife were both buying watches just before leaving Mexico. From the above it appears that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

SECRET

12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:

Mexico City Station considers Subject suspect RIS because he appears better educated that his duties as a guard would demand, because he seems financially better off than other Soviet guards and because of his apparent association on equal footing with Soviet RIS officers. DERYABIN in 1955 advised LNERGO that the surname OBYEDKOV was familiar to him as the name of a person who was in the Guards Directorate of the MVD in 1951.

In September 1967 DERYABIN and RASTVOROV said that they neither recognized the face nor the name of the Subject. (Both Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Dmitriyevich were seen by the defectors and they did not recognize either of them.)

13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:

There was no intelligence activity noted on the Subject's part while he was stationed in Mexico.

14. NON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:

Subject primarily handled the main Soviet telephone and took guard duty at the gate. Subject took messages for other Soviets, notified them of meetings, and contacted them for appointments with each other. He occasionally drove one of

2.  Aleksandr Mikhaylovich DENISOV (201-726491), Second Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico from August 1962 to April 1967, known GRU. Subject appeared not to like DENISOV. It also appeared that DENISOV was responsible for reimbursing Subject for the gas Subject used in- KUKHARENKO's car.

7. Vladimir Aleksandrovich ROMANCHENKO (201-727109),
   Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico from August 1963 to July 1967, no known RIS affiliation. When ROMANCHENKO was in Moscow on leave in May 1964, Subject told "Boris" (believed to be Subject's brother-in-law) to send letters to him through ROMANCHENKO when he came back to Mexico.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

REFERENCES: A. HMMA-26824, 10 August 1965

B. MEXI-4485, 19 August 1965

1.  Reference A reported the departure of Subject from Mexico on 4 August 1965. The Station now believes that Subject departed PCS, and that he has possibly been replaced by Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN, whose arrival on 14 August 1965 was reported in Reference B.

2.  According to LIENVOY, KARCHIN has been answering the telephone at the Soviet Embassy, a duty for which Subject was previously responsible. According to LICALLA, KARCHIN has also been taking guard duty at the entrance gate to the Soviet Embassy, which Subject also had as one of his duties.

3.  In addition, LIENVOY reported that on 17 August 1965 that "a new school director" had arrived at the Soviet Embassy. OBYEDKOVA had previously been the director of the Soviet school in Mexico, and the fact that she had been replaced indicates that she will not return to Mexico. The identity of the new school director has not been established, although it may be KARCHINA.

4.  The attached Soviet Personality Report (SPR) on Subject represents a summary of Station information on him. It is noted that Subject is listed as suspect RIS, service unknown. his previous designation as suspect KGB was based primarily on his presumed identity with the subject of 201-121531, which has now been established as incorrect.

10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, HABITS:

Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, he appeared to be fairly well educated and was not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV (201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy Stepanovich VISKO with her arithmetic homework. On another, Subject was asked about methods of producing metal wire, a subject on which Subject was well informed as a result of his having once worked for a wire factory (1).

Subject had a tape recorder at home which he likedto listen to. He also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets (1).

Subject told "Boris" /paragraph 7c above/ in Moscow to build a large garage, because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also asked whether "Boris" had bought a refrigerator and TV for the apartment. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can of paint to take back to Moscow with him to repaint "the Moskvich." Subject and his wife were both buying watches just before leaving Mexico. (1). / From the above it appears that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard/.

11. CURRICULUM VITAE:

(date unknown)

Subject reportedly had worked at the *Serp i Molot* wire factory in Leningrad (1).

28 August 1962

Subject, accompanied by his wife and son, arrived in Mexico as employee of the Soviet Embassy. Subject replaced Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich YEGOROV (201-273431, /suspect GRU/. (2) Iu Mexico City Subject and his family lived at Tacambaro 4, reportedly in Apartment 5 in January 1963 and in Apartment 4 in July 1965. (1).

22 July 1965

Subject's wife and son departed Mexico for the USSR (5).

4 August 1965

Subject departed Mexico for the USSR (3). Subject is believed to have been replaced by Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN (no Station traces.)

12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION: Suspect RIS.

The Station has no real evidence of Subject's intelligence affiliation; however, because Subject appears better educated than his duties as a guard would demand, because he seems financially better off than other Soviet guards, and because of his apparent association on an equal footing with Soviet officers, he is considered suspect RIS. It is further noted that Subject's predecessor was suspect GRU.

13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY: Unknown.

14. NON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:

In Mexico City Subject primarily handled the main Soviet Embassy telephone (1) and also took guard duty at the gate (3), Subject took messages for other Soviets, notified then of meetings, and contacted them for appointments with each other. He also occasionally drove one of the Embassy cars on errands. He kept a ledger of the telegrams sent out by the Embassy and notified other Soviets when cables came in for them (1).

KMMA - 27030

On 17 August 1963 Subject stated that he had just returned from a trip with Valentin Vasilyevich BAKULIN (231-261813) (1). /BAKULIN is an identified GRU officer. The Station has no further information on the nature of this trip, nor any reports of other trips taken by Subject./

From 6 to 19 November 1962 Subject was in the hospital (Sanitorio Reforma) in Mexico City. On 11 November he underwent a three-hour operation of an unspecified nature. The other Soviets had to take guard duty with him in the hospital, and it was stressed that one of the Soviet men should be with him after he came out of the operation. (1).

15. CONTACTS:

Subject is not known to have had any contact with non-Soviets during his tour in Mexico, with the exception of an occasional visit to one of the doctors regularly consulted by the Soviets. Subject's closest Soviet contacts appeared to be the following:

a. Valeriy Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV (201-293945), employee in the Soviet Commercial Office in Mexico from February 1961 to May 1964, suspect RIS. When the ANDRIANOVS left Mexico they were planning to get in touch with Subject's family in Moscow (1).

b. Aleksandr Mikhaylovich DENISOV (201-726491), Second Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico since August 1962, known GRU. Subject appeared not to like DENISOV. It also appeared that DENISOV was responsible for reimbursing Subject for the gas Subject used in KUKHARENKO's (see below) car (1).

c. Aleksey Nikolayevich GANIN (201-757775), known GRU officer who visited Mexico 31 July - 14 August 1964. Subject, along with other Soviets who were known GRU officers, met GANIN on his visit to Mexico (6).

d. Sergey Semenovich KUKHARENKO (201-260831), chief of the Soviet information Bulletin in Mexico from October 1962 to August 1964, suspect KGB. Subject and KUKHARENKO were the best of friends for a time, but then KUKHARENKO began drinking too much and getting into various scrapes. Subject frequently commiserated with KUKHARENKO's wife over her husband's drinking, automobile accidents, money problems. Subject occasionally used KUKHARENKO's car. (1).

e. Oleg Pavlovich MOSKVICHEV (201-285090), employee in the Soviet Commercial Office in Mexico from March 1961 to July 1964, known KGB. Subject gave MOSKVICHEV his home address in Moscow (1)........

f. Vladimir Nikolayevich RADVANSKIY (201-298171), code clerk at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico since September 1964, known KGB. Subject is not known to have associated with RADVANSKIY; however, Subject's wife and RADVANSKAYA worked together in the school and children's camp, and RADVANSKAYA took over the camp after Subject's wife left Mexico. RADVANSKAYA asked Subject's wife to tell her (RADVANSKAYA's) daughter to enter the institute when she saw her in Moscow (1).

g. Vladimir Aleksandrovich ROMANCHENKO (201-727109), Second Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico since August 1963, no known RIS affiliation. When ROMANCHENKO was in Moscow on loave in May 1964, Subject told "Boris" (believed to be Subject's brother-in-law) to send letters to him through ROMANCHENKO when he came back to Mexico. Subject said that ROMANCHENKO could be reached through (Enu) MURAVYEV at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1).

SUBJECT

Ivan Dmitriyevich OSTROV

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

REFERENCE: IMMA 2017, 25 May 1965

1. Headquarters agrees that Subject is probably not identical with
   Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV (201-121531) as was earlier believed, and has
   accordingly assigned Ivan Dmitriyevich 201-779495. A full Headquarters
   trace under that name turned up no information other than that originating
   from Mexico City Station, which has now been re-classified into the new
   file. We are puzzled by the fact that MEXI-1850, dated 1 September 1962, the
   first piece of correspondence from Mexico City Station on Subject, reported
   him as Ivan Ivanovich.

2. A photo comparison of the two individuals in this case is not
   satisfactory proof that they az in fact two people because of the difference
   in years and exposure in the photographs. The pre-Mexico City traces on
   Ivan Ivanovich reflect only a date and place of birth as identifying data.
   It is hoped that Mexico City Station can obtain soon identifying biographic
   data on Ivan Dmitriyevich in order to firmly resolve the matter.

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: REDWOOD / Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV

SECURITY: SECRETE

PROCESSING ACTION: MARKED FOR INDEXING

REFERENCE: XXX NO INDEXING REQD

ORIGIN: CCC A Mexico City, Mexico

1. Douglas J. FEINGLASS has reported that the OBYEDKOV who is in Mexico City is definitely Ivan Dmitriyevich, not Ivan Ivanovich as previously recorded. (Source: LIENVOY tapes.) It is impossible to check the original flight manifest listing OBYEDKOV's arrival in 1962, since this has been destroyed.

2. OBYEDKOV also appear's to be much younger than the Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV (201-121531) who was born 14 July 1912 and with whom Subject was assumed to be identical. No date of birth is available for the OBYEDKOV in Mexico City.

3. Subject's wife is Yelena Lvovna OBYEDKOVA. They have a son Vladimir, born roughly in 1953. LICALLA photographs of Subject and his wife are enclosed. According to LIENVOY, Subject's home address in Moscow is Moscow E-143. Metrogorodok, Otkrytoye Shosse 26, Buliding 7, Apt. 69, telephone G3-72-34. In 1964 the apartment was occupied by Boris Lvovich DMITRIYEV and Mariya Borisovna DMITRIYEVA..

4. Headquarters is requested to retrace Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV and assign a new 201 number if Headquarters agrees that he is not identical with the Subject of 201-121531.

1. Iraq

a. The new 21-man cabinet appears to be a coalition of Arab nationalist elements including four members of the moderate wing of the Baath Party. The regime is still dominated by the military, with eight cabinet posts.

b. The new prime minister, Tahir Yahya, is sympathetic to the Baath Party, and both the Baathists and the Egyptians feel they can trust him.

c. The political affiliation of eight of the new ministers is not known, but the key interior post is in the hands of an anti-Baathist nationalist.

2. Indonesia

a. Defense Minister Nasution has been ordered by Sukarno to make conciliatory statements on Malaysia while on his trip abroad.

b. The Dutch chargé who reported this explained that Nasution was chosen for this job because Sukarno was irritated with the ultra-tough line the defense minister has taken.

3. Congo

c. The chargé has no information on the motives behind this switch. Our embassy thinks it may be a move to pave the way for exploratory talks by Foreign Minister Subandrio at Bangkok with his Thai and Philippine counterparts. It may also be meant to provide a more receptive attitude for Nasution's visit here.

d. Our embassy thinks Nasution went in for his Malaysia sabre rattling on Sukarno's orders, or at the very least, with the president's tacit support. Sukarno may feel Nasution has stolen some of his thunder.

a. Adoula still did not get around to announcing the expulsion of all Soviet and Czech embassy personnel yesterday. However, people managed on Tuesday afternoon to corral and hog-tie the Soviet counselor and press attaché before they could eat-up all the incriminating papers in their possession.

b. The Russians are now being held at Ndolo prison. The Congolese surete says the seized papers include, (among other things, minutes of a "liberation committee" meeting of opposition politicians in Brazzaville, and a document showing Soviet payments to this group.

4. Ethiopia-
   Congo

c. The Belgian ambassador thinks these papers are probably genuine. He says the Russians have made the mistake of underrating the Congolese and have stumbled into a surete trap.

d. The Congolese also picked up two Czech diplomats but have since released them. This morning they arrested the correspondent of the Soviet news agency.

a. Haile Selassie is planning to withdraw all Ethiopian troops from the Congo in January, according to the commander of his ground forces.

b. The two battalions of Ethiopians provide the guts of the UN operation. They had been slated to stay until June and are likely to be very difficult to replace.

c. The Emperor reportedly ordered the withdrawal on grounds that the troops are urgently needed in Ethiopia, particularly in view of the Soviet military accord with Somalia.

d. Our ambassador has asked to see the Emperor, as well as the prime minister and foreign minister, to press for reconsideration.

5. Yemen

   a. Military activity has slackened but the stalemate continues.

   b. Egypt still has about 32,000 troops in Yemen, and Saudi Crown Prince Faysal believes Nasir will not withdraw any significant number of them before 4 January when the extension of the disengagement agreement expires.

   c. Faysal is preparing to resume aid to the royalists at that time; he is stockpiling quantities of arms and ammunition along the border.
   (Includes INTERCEPTS)

6. Turkey

   a. The opposition Justice Party, heir of the old Menderes regime, appears to have won a victory in Sunday's nationwide local elections on the basis of incomplete returns.

   b. The collapse of Prime Minister Inonu's coalition government appears increasingly likely. Though a new coalition may be formed, there will be considerable resistance to the retention of Inonu as prime minister.

(Cont'd)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 7

c. Justice Party members will be putting on pressure for early national parliamentary elections. However their party leaders do not believe the Turkish military, which ousted Menderes in 1960, would permit them to take over if they won new elections.

d. They will probably try to work out some rapprochement with the armed forces.

# NOTES

A. Cuba The U-2 which flew yesterday's mission over Cuba crashed while returning, about 40 miles north of Key West. Air and sea rescue craft were sent to the scene. An air rescue unit sighted an unopened parachute, a life raft, and oil slick in the crash area. The pilot is presumed lost. There is no indication that the plane was attacked.

B. Berlin Local East German troops acting without higher authority appear to have been responsible for turning high powered searchlights on pilots taking off from West Berlin's Tempelhof airfield on 14-16 November. There were five such incidents. A message of 16 November instructed border guard elements to discontinue such acts. There have been no further incidents reported since.

C. Albania-USSR A Radio Tirana broadcast has accused Khrushchev of personally releasing Barghoorn for fear that Moscow's wheat deal with the US might collapse. The Albanians are on record as preferring to eat grass rather than to kowtow to the West, but they are not above eating Chinese wheat acquired from Western sources.

D. Iran-USSR The Soviet Union's timing seems to be off in Iran. Government sources have reported that a twin engined plane was shot down in Iranian territory yesterday by Soviet jet fighters who violated Iranian air space. The Iranians say that the plane was on a photographic mission in connection with the

(Cont'd)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

government's land reform drive. The pilot was injured and his two passengers were killed. The incident comes at a time when Soviet President Brezhnev is visiting Tehran. He addressed a joint session of parliament today. NBR

E. Venezuela Police seem to have restored order in downtown-Caracas, but terrorism continues elsewhere. The slum district of Caracas to which the terrorists retreated is under virtual martial law. Among other things, the Dupont paint warehouse at Maracaibo was set afire and totally destroyed. NBR

F. World Peace Council The WPC meeting in Warsaw next Thursday may wind up in another free-for-all. The Chinese Communist delegation, although not intent on disrupting the conference, plans to attack the WPC president's report given to a committee meeting in Vienna last September. The Japanese delegates plan to give general support to the Chinese and will try to forestall a vote on the Moscow test ban treaty. NBR

   Although sporadic gunfire continued through the night in Baghdad, the army is in control.

   b. Arif has plans to announce the make-up of his cabinet today. It will probably contain some "mild" Baathists.

   c. He permitted Syrian strongman Hafiz and Michel Aflaq, the founder of the Baath Party, who were caught in Baghdad by the coup, to fly back to Damascus yesterday after the Syrian radio suddenly stopped vilifying the newest Iraqi regime.

   d. Arif and his colleagues obviously hope to reach an understanding with the Syrian regime. We doubt very much if they are interested, however, in the meaningful political and military unity the previous regime was aiming for.

   e. An intercepted message indicates that Syrian army units, now in Iraq, are getting ready to go home.

   f. The retention of Baathists in positions of power in Baghdad also tends to ease the threat to the party in Syria.

2. Venezuela

a. The Communist effort to frustrate the presidential election (1 December) continues.

b. An illegal transmitter was heard yesterday in Caracas calling for a 48-hour general strike and urging listeners to arm themselves against the Betancourt government.

c. Roving bands of Communist-led terrorists sought to enforce the generally unsuccessful strike with gunfire. There were at least nine deaths (some reports go as high as 19). Guerrilla activity in rural areas is also being stepped up.

d. The government has jailed an added 200 extremists in the wake of yesterday's violence and plans are afoot to detain 1,500 more.

e. The army is being held in reserve in the Caracas area. (includes Intercepts)

3. South Vietnam

a. Ton That Dinh, whom we had earlier identified as the least reliable of the generals' group, is trying to use his position as security minister to build himself an independent political base.

b. He has been visiting provin- cial cities to "explain" the military takeover and receive expressions of loyalty. He has continued to spread the idea that the coup was largely his own doing.

c. Dinh has directed provincial chiefs to submit to him daily reports on local politics. (INTERCEPTS)

d. This is going on while other members of the regime are squabbling about who should be in the "council of sages" and what it should do.

a. We have picked up further details on the surface-to-surface missile system which a French firm is developing for the Israelis.

b. The firm, Marcel Dassault, is to produce and test fire 25 missiles between July 1964 and July 1965. An actual production contract for perhaps 250 missiles will be drawn up late in the period if all goes well.

c. Design requirements call for the delivery of a 1,600-pound warhead to a maximum range of 300 miles with a CEP slightly in excess of half a mile. A conventional warhead would not make military sense under these specifications.

a. Pamphlets and posters bitterly lampooning Nasir, especially for his involvement in Yemen and Algeria, have appeared on the streets of Cairo and Suez.

b. Such public expression of anti-Nasir sentiment is highly unusual.

c. It is still in a very low key, however, and there is no sign of organized opposition.

d. We do not consider Nasir to be in any immediate danger of overthrow, though he could be forced to modify unpopular policies if the discontent spreads.

b. The city has already witnessed four minor demonstrations which Embassy La Paz attributes to left-wingers encouraged by Lechin's presence.

c. Lechin, who has ambitions to replace President Paz, intends to tour the country to rally his political forces, now in disarray as a result of some astute moves by Paz.

d. If Lechin decides after these soundings to come out openly against the president, he will try to arrange a series of strikes early next year to point up his strength.

# NOTES

A. Congo A clandestine source tells us that Adoula will finally announce this morning the expulsion of all personnel of the Soviet and Czech embassies. This move has been hanging fire ever since security officials turned up evidence several weeks ago implicating personnel of these embassies in antigovernment activities. The Congolese ambassador in Moscow has been directed to destroy his classified files.

B. USSR A new series of extended range missile tests seems to be upcoming. Three Soviet range instrumentation ships left Petropavlovsk nine days ago and are apparently headed for the more distant Pacific impact area, 6,500 miles from Tyuratam. There has so far been no announcement closing the area. (INTERCEPTS)

C. Sino-Soviet Peiping has been quick to exploit the opening provided by Barghoorn's release. To the Chinese this affair is an object lesson in how Khrushchev knuckles under to US pressure without getting a thing in return.

D. USSR-Cuba The five passenger ships we mentioned in last Thursday's Checklist have docked and departed. Some of them brought in rotational troops and all of them took out Soviet personnel. We cannot strike a firm balance on the basis of the evidence we now have, but it is possible that as many Soviets went out as came in. (INTERCEPTS)

E. Czechoslovakia-Mali We have an intercepted message
from the Malian ambassador in Prague reporting in-
cidents between Czechs and Malians a week ago Sunday.
There were, the ambassador notes, "only six wounded
on the Malian side." (INTERCEPT)

F. Japan Ikeda does not appear to be in any particular
trouble in tomorrow's elections. The long-range trend
toward the left in popular vote will probably be ap-
parent, but Ikeda's Liberal Democratic Party should
retain a safe majority in the next Diet. The leftists
have tried to turn rising prices and last week's twin
disasters into election ammunition, but without
marked success.

G. Indonesia Djakarta is trying to round up support
for making Sukarno's little Olympics, the "Games of
the New Emerging Forces," a permanent thing. In
making a pitch along these lines to the Philippine
ambassador, a high Indonesian official candidly ad-
mitted that Djakarta views this sort of athletic
competition as a means of achieving political ends.
(INTERCEPTS)

H. Israel The Israeli foreign office says Ben Gurion
is denying the Sulzberger account in last Saturday's
New York Times of Ben Gurion's "hints" about experi-
ments in "military atomics" at Dimona. Ambassador
Barbour is not entirely convinced of this, however,
and recalls Ben Gurion's oft-expressed opinion that
it does no harm to let Nasir worry about Dimona.

I. Brazil A new round of army promotions and shifts
in command are due to be announced Monday. Anti-
Goulart elements fear, probably with good reason,
that their ranks will be further thinned. Congeni-tal plotters on the far right are talking coup yet
again.

Note from Ed Hauck

CIB

a. Vietnamese Communist efforts to discredit the new Saigon regime stayed in high gear this week.

b. The number of armed attacks was off from the high of the previous week but still some 50% above the year's weekly average.

c. These attacks have been, for the most part, small-scale efforts directed against the government's paramilitary forces in the villages. They have been designed more for their psychological impact than for immediate military gain.

d. A high volume of messages on Viet Cong military and political communications nets indicates a probable continuation of this effort.

e. The new government is responding by stepping up its own military operations. It is also setting about the hard job of revamping the Diem government apparatus and harnessing broader popular support for the war effort.

f. The generals have been dealing fairly effectively with

their new responsibilities. There are, however, a few signs of dissen- sion within this group and between it and civilian politicians.

g. One of the more ambitious and troublesome figures is the able but opportunistic General Ton That Dinh, the new Minister of Security. He has been travelling about the country spreading the idea that the coup was largely his doing and seems bent on developing his own independ- ent base of power. He is a man to watch.

h. The new regime has also embarked on a purge of high military officers who sided with Diem during the Buddhist crisis and failed to get on the right side soon enough. (INTERCEPTS)

2. Venezuela

a. The death toll from the terrorist outburst in Caracas last Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at about 30.

b. This is the high water mark thus far in the campaign of the Castro-supported Communist extremists to disrupt the national elections a week from tomorrow.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

c. The Betancourt government has struck back hard. Its new unified command over the security forces, set up at US urging, passed this initial test with flying colors.

d. At least 500 extremists were arrested and the round-up is still going on. Their removal will hamper the Communist drive against elections in major cities like Caracas.

e. We now expect the elections to be held on schedule, a considerable achievement under the circumstances. The elections will be followed, however, by a Communist effort to prevent the March inauguration of the victor.

f. The rub here is that none of the presidential candidates commands President Betancourt's considerable assets for dealing successfully with the harsh realities of Venezuelan politics. The constitution prevents Betancourt from succeeding himself.

g. In the background, as always, looms the military, which could intervene if the president-elect shows signs of being soft on communism.

3. USSR-Cuba

a. In the past week we intercepted Cuban military messages which show that Cuban interpreters are now posted at several surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites on the island.

b. We think this means that on-site training of Cubans has begun on schedule. Field training is to last six months, after which the SAM system may be turned over to Castro.

c. In the past month some 1,500 Soviets arrived in Cuba. Most of these were probably SAM experts, sent to monitor the training.

d. Prior to their coming, we had detected no more than a few hundred Soviet military personnel entering Cuba since the October crisis last year.

e. We estimate that at least 15,000, and probably closer to 18,000, have been withdrawn in the intervening 13 months, leaving, very roughly, 4,000 to 7,000. Those remaining are for the most part advisors whose main functions are to train and supervise Cubans in the use of weapons turned over to them.

a. We have had an indication that Soviet harassment of Allied access routes to West Berlin will shift this weekend to the air corridors.

b. The Soviet man at the Berlin air traffic control center told the Allied representatives yesterday that Soviet transports would be using the air corridors for brief flights during the next five weekends.

c. Moscow has tried on a number of past occasions to assert its right to restrict Allied use of the air corridors. In early 1962, the Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks" of air space for their own use. They have since demanded that Western flights stay between stipulated altitudes, that we file flight plans in advance and provide prior notice of border-crossing times.

d. This sort of harassment stopped in the spring of 1962 when Soviet leaders became convinced that the US was interested in a serious discussion of a Berlin settlement. Moscow may hope that the threat of more of this sort of harassment will jog the US into talks on Berlin.

a. It now appears that President Arif's role in last Monday's coup in Baghdad may have been virtually that of a bystander.

b. According to our latest information, Arif was wakened early that morning and given five minutes to join up. Tahir Yahya, now prime minister, was reportedly the organizer.

c. Whatever Arif's role may have been, the coup was primarily an effort by the Iraqi Army to curtail the activities of the extreme wing of the Baath Party. The Baath is an Arab nationalist political organization, active throughout the Arab world, which has been ruling Iraq and Syria.

d. The coup group has not thrown all Baathists out of the government; there are party members in the new cabinet.

e. Syrian Baathists have welcomed this retention of their Iraqi brothers. Their attitude springs from the recognition that the Baath in Syria cannot stay afloat without support from Iraq. Even so, we hear talk of coup plotting in Damascus.

f. The reaction of Nasir's Egypt, which passionately desires to see the Baath go under, has been exactly the opposite. Cairo has been backing off its all-out support for the coup ever since the new cabinet was announced.

after the Congolese turned up good documentary evi-
dence of their complicity in anti-government plots.
One of the items taken off a Soviet diplomat the
other day was a letter from an anti-Adoula leader
now in Brazzaville asking for funds and arms to over
throw the Leopoldville government.

C. Britain The Labor Party scored again in the Dundee
West by-election Thursday, increasing its 1959
majority of 719 to a thumping 4,955. Heartened by
this, Labor is now pushing for general elections at
once. Prime Minister Home is not likely to accede.

D. Ecuador The military junta which has run Ecuador
since July may be about to come unstuck. We have a
report that one of the less savory members of the
group, air force Colonel Freiles, will try to take
over full control this weekend. We are not sure
of the reliability of this report, but Freiles is
known to have been making motions in this direction.

E. Thailand Prime Minister Sarit, who suffers from an incurable liver disease, is failing. Doctors attending him, including one of our own, give him no more than six months more. Sarit has attempted to arrange for an orderly succession when he does go. The chances of this are not good; Thai politicians and military figures are already jostling one another for position.

F. USSR Cosmos 22, launched a week ago, was recovered yesterday. It is the eleventh unmanned satellite to be recovered. All recoverable satellites have been launched from Tyuratam, the main Soviet missile test center, and recovered after three to ten days aloft. A series of non-recoverable satellites has been fired from Kapustin Yar.

1. North Vietnam -
   South Vietnam

a. North Vietnamese leaders are pressing their campaign for neutralization of South Vietnam.

b. They can count on Cambodia's support. Prince Sihanouk has said he believes neutralization of South Vietnam to be the only way to keep his country and the rest of the area from falling eventually into Communist hands.

c. The French feel the same way. Indeed, Souvanna Phouma reportedly told a closed session of the Laotian National Assembly that the French were urging him to support Hanoi in this.

d. Moreover, according to one of our clandestine sources, the North Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into backing the neutralization proposition in the UN.

e. The troublesome Polish ICC delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who will be going home soon), has just returned to Vientiane from Hanoi and is trying, with somewhat less success, to enlist British support too.

f. As part of the same campaign, the North Vietnamese have told the French they believe sentiment is growing in the US for withdrawal of US forces. They reportedly plan to keep the heat on to encourage it.

g. Hanoi is at the same time trying quietly to encourage the belief that it is ready to be reasonable.

h. To hear Thee tell it, North Vietnamese leaders feel that neutrality for South Vietnam and eventual reunification is the only way they, too, can escape from Peiping's clutches.

a. As is usual in Laos, the tentative agreement for a cease-fire reached last week between Kong Le and Pathet Lao commander Singkapo came to naught.

b. Each side accuses the other of planning to use a cease-fire to screen preparations for larger attacks.

c. There is scattered fighting in the Plaine des Jarres. Lao Army, neutralist, and Meo guerrilla elements are jointly engaged in a limited offensive in the Vang Vieng

> d. We have been anticipating an expansion of the fighting with the recent advent of the dry season.

> a. Sihanouk knows his actions against us have increased his vulnerability to the Communist bloc, and he is looking to the French to bail him out.

> b. He has intimated that aid from France would be most welcome, and he has asked that French advisors stay on.

> c. He apparently hopes that the availability of French aid will enable him to keep his balance with the Communists and fend off their pressure.

> d. The French have told our Embassy in Paris that plans are afoot for French Defense Minister Messmer to go to Cambodia in January.

e. Sihanouk's actions toward the US have not been universally popular. This is particularly true among government officials, the business community (who have reason to fear stepped-up nationalization), and the military, where the US retains a considerable reservoir of goodwill.

f. Indications are that Sihanouk will try to win fuller support by creating new feuds with neighboring South Vietnam and Thailand. This is a gambit he has used to advantage in past difficulties.

a. A number of Yemeni leaders have told us they want the Egyptians to get out of the Yemen. They want to be left alone to solve their own problems.

b. This is especially true of those Sheikhs with large tribal followings.

c. A general uprising against the Egyptians is not likely at the moment, but the longer they remain, the greater the possibility of major pro-government tribes deserting to the royalists.

# PARTY COMPOSITION OF THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT OCTOBER 1963

> [Figure] This pie chart illustrates the party composition of the Italian Parliament in October 1963. It presents two pie charts, one each for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, showing the distribution of seats among various political parties.

## CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES

![Pie chart of party composition of the Chamber of Deputies] The total number of seats is 630. The Christian Democrats hold the largest share with 260 seats, followed by the Communists with 155 seats, and the Socialists with 87 seats. The Liberals have 39 seats, the Social Democrats have 33 seats, and the Republicans have 6 seats. Other parties include 4 seats for 'Others,' 8 seats for Monarchists, and 27 seats for Neo-Fascists.

## SENATE

![Pie chart of party composition of the Senate] The total number of seats is 315. The Christian Democrats also hold the largest share in the Senate with 133 seats, followed by the Communists with 85 seats, and the Socialists with 44 seats. The Liberals have 19 seats, and the Social Democrats have 14 seats. Other parties include 3 seats for 'Others,' 2 seats for Monarchists, and 15 seats for Neo-Fascists.

d. Nasir, with some 30,000 troops in the Yemen, has grudgingly promised to pull out 5,000 before the end of the year. So far there has been no sign he is preparing to do so.

e. So far as we can tell, Faysal has kept to his promise not to supply the Royalists before the latest extension of the UN observation mission runs out on 4 January.

f. But he has made plain his intention to resume supplying them thereafter. There has been a substantial build up of Saudi supply points north of the border.

a. The Christian Democrats and Socialists have finally reached an' agreement on cabinet assignments and a program for a "centerleft" coalition government.

b. Negotiations were especially tough, but apparently President Kennedy's death acted as a catalyst to bring the two together.

NOTES

A. India-USSR The Indian military attache in Moscow
feels that the Russians are dragging their feet in
the matter of military assistance for India. Mean-
while, we have a report (not yet confirmed) from
New Delhi that Defense Minister Chavan has decided
to look to us hereafter for fighter aircraft.

B. USSR Our Embassy in Moscow has gotten word of
strikes recently at Ryazan, near Moscow, and in
Leningrad. The cause of the Ryazan incident is not
clear, but bread shortages apparently were behind
the Leningrad strikes. Similar disturbances were
reported last month from several points in southern
Russia.

1. South Vietnam

a. Vietnamese Communist forces kept up their high post-coup level of activity over the weekend.

b. The most significant action was an attack early yesterday morning against a US special forces training camp some 30 miles from Saigon.

c. When the smoke cleared after a sharp fight, four US soldiers were missing and at least 35 South Vietnamese were dead.

d. Late yesterday morning, the Viet Cong shot down two aircraft supporting a government operation in the extreme south, and damaged twelve more. Two more Americans are missing in this action.

e. Back in Saigon, the new regime's troubles with the ambitious General Ton That Dinh continue.

f. He is still angling to get control of the important strategic hamlet program and has yet to give up command of the Third Corps, which the generals assigned to another of their number earlier in the month. This corps is of particular significance in that it surrounds Saigon.

4. Iraq

   a. The air of tension in Baghdad dissipated somewhat after the government lifted the curfew and once again permitted private vehicles on the streets.

   b. Neither the city nor its new rulers are, however, at ease. Troops are still very much in evidence.

   c. The new regime apparently is not convinced that the hard core of the Baath Party and its paramilitary supporters have been put down for good.

5. Syria

   a. We have information that a showdown between the moderate and extremist factions of the ruling Baath Party in Syria is fast approaching.

   c. The Betancourt government has scheduled a press conference tomorrow to break the story that a three-ton cache of Cuban arms has been unearthed. A formal accusation against Cuba is to be made before the Organization of American States a week from today. (Includes INTERCEPTS)

   b. A clandestine source identifies Prime Minister Hafiz as the leading figure on the side of moderation. General Umran heads the doctrinaire extremists.

   c. It was a split along the same lines that brought about the Baath Party's fall from power in Iraq.

   a. Premier-designate Moro expects that the program for a "center-left" coalition government will be approved today by the four parties involved.

   b. Details of the foreign policy planks are not yet available, but they were drafted with the thought that the death of President Kennedy makes it more important for Italy to play an active role within the Western alliance.

   c. After the program has been approved, the final selection of a cabinet can be undertaken. This could take the rest of the week.

c. As in the previous cases, the Saudis have lodged a formal complaint with the UN Observation Mission.

NOTES

A. Oswald Press stories to the effect that Lee Harvey
Oswald recently visited Mexico City are true, accord-
ing to our information. Oswald visited both the
Cuban and the Soviet embassies on 28 September. He
was trying, we are told, to arrange for visas so
that he could travel to the USSR via Havana. He
returned to the US on 3 October.

B. Brazil A new round of military promotions and re-
assignments will be made public today. The present
instability of the Brazilian political scene is re-
flected in the numerous reports of coup plots which
this event has precipitated.

C. USSR At last report the three Soviet range in-
strumentation ships were dead in the water 500 miles
south of Johnston Island, roughly the same position
they occupied for last year's extended range ICBM
shots. No announcement closing this area of the
Pacific to shipping has been made and there is no
activity as yet at the Tyuratam missile test center,
but we look for some action in the next few days.
(INTERCEPTS)

D. Algeria We have a report from a good clandestine
source that a group of army officers is plotting
with Defense Minister Boumedienne to overthrow Ben
Bella. A growing estrangement between the two has
been apparent for some time, but this is the first
good indication that Boumedienne is making common
cause with those who wish to turn Ben Bella out of
office.

E. Australia - Communist China Peiping has signed contracts for just over one million tons of Australian grain to be delivered early next year. We had been expecting the Chinese Communists to enter the market, since they had another mediocre grain crop this year. Peiping has been buying close to five million tons of grain for the past several years.

F. Congo We hear that the Soviet Embassy in Leopoldville had booked 75 places on a flight to Brussels last Saturday. There is still no information on whether any Soviet Embassy officials have actually departed, however.

G. Berlin There was no new harassment of Allied access routes to Berlin over the weekend. A total of 16 flares were fired last evening near Tempelhof Airfield, but we connect these with Communist efforts to prevent escapes from East Berlin. East German police were observed stringing barbed wire in the same area a short time later.

H. Laos The neutralists claim to have made significant gains in their limited offensive in the Vang Vieng area. They have not, however, been able to dislodge the Pathet Lao from positions within artillery range of the town's airport.

1. Iraq-Syria

a. The shaky new accommodation between the two countries following the recent coup in Iraq has been threatened by Syria's action in granting asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the exiled leader of the extremist wing of the Iraqi Baath.

b. Saadi had arrived in Syria unannounced following a brief stay in Madrid. On Friday, Iraq sent a message asking Syria to expel him on grounds that sheltering him was a breach of agreement.

c. Both regimes continue to be troubled with internal dissension with affairs in one deeply tangled with those in the other.

d. In Syria, as we mentioned yesterday, the Baathist regime is split between moderates who desire a broadening of the government's power base, and a doctrinaire faction which wants to keep all control of the government in Baathist hands.

e. In Iraq, the pull is more away from the Baathists. Two ministers have threatened to resign unless the government adopts an openly pro-Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the government feels secure enough to ease up on curfew and transport restrictions imposed since the coup.

a. Intercepted neutralist messages on Sunday reported that government forces had finally secured Vang Vieng and its airfield, long held by the Pathet Lao. They also told of the capture of Ban Namone farther south on Route 13.

b. The neutralist, rightist Lao Army, and Meo tribal guerrilla forces hope to sustain their coordinated clearing action until remaining Pathet Lao pockets in this area north of Vientiane are cleared.

c. Such operations in Laos have often been followed by a Communist riposte. We have a few indicators that something could be up on the Communist side, but these are so far very tenuous indeed.

d. One such indicator is a stand down in the last two weeks on the Hanoi-controlled military communications net in Laos which could

a. According to press reports, Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped out two of the government's strategic hamlets in the central highlands about 250 miles north of Saigon.

b. More than 1,000 inhabitants in the hamlets--who are minority tribesmen--are missing and possibly have fled into the mountains. They abandoned a significant quantity of weapons to the Viet Cong.

c. These attacks not only suggest continued erosion of the government's programs to win over tribal support, but also signal that stepped-up Viet Cong pressure against the new regime is spreading to the north.

d. This Communist effort is aimed at discrediting the post-Diem regime before the new leadership is able to get its feet on the ground and capture the loyalty and respect of people in the provinces.

e. Although the Viet Cong still continues to draw its main strength from local recruiting, a steady stream of cadre and training personnel continues to make its way to the south from North Vietnam along the Laotian border.

f. We are now reasonably sure that at least 784 persons infiltrated from the north during 1963 and the actual total may be much higher.

a. There have been no further developments in Soviet preparations for a series of extended range ICBM shots to the Pacific.

b. We probably should have had by now an announcement closing an area roughly 500 miles south of Johnston Island to shipping. We suspect the Soviets may have delayed it in order not to appear to be rattling rockets immediately after President Kennedy's death.

5. USSR-Berlin

c. The USSR may repeat last year's performance of multiple fir- ings from a prototype operational complex at Tyuratam. Three such launchings were attempted at five- minute intervals in May 1963; two succeeded.

d. We also do not rule out the possibility of firings from opera- tional sites as opposed to the test center at Tyuratam. We observed the first such firing on 22 October from the Plesetsk site, roughly 400 miles northeast of Moscow. (Includes INTERCEPTS)

a. Embassy Bonn feels that the Soviet Union may be seeking at least a temporary modus vivendi on the autobahn without prejudicing its juridical position, which can be used to cause difficulties there in the future.

b. The embassy bases this on the Soviet replies to the Western notification to the USSR on 29 October regarding harmonized convoy procedures--two oral statements on 16 November and a note of 21 Novem- ber.

c. The Soviet note was designed to make a record, showing that the USSR exercises "control" of the autobahn and that the recent incidents resulted from US refusal to comply with "existing procedures."

d. On the other hand, the Soviet procedures described in the oral replies seem to reflect actual Allied practices, though there is enough ambiguity to afford the USSR flexibility in any future actions.

a. The danger of an immediate coup against the Goulart regime has receded with the reported decision of Second Army Commander General Bevilaqua not to join the coup plotters.

b. Bevilaqua, who has been something of a storm center, may have been asked to hand over his command today as part of a series of reassignments made by President Goulart to keep the military off balance.

c. On the other side of the coin, there is widespread belief that Goulart himself will at some time resort to a coup to establish an authoritarian regime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

d. As one example Raneiri Mazzilli, President of the Chamber of Deputies and next in line for the presidency, told Ambassador Gordon on Saturday that he profoundly mistrusts Goulart's intentions and intends to maintain the strictest congressional vigilance.

e. Our station in Brazil believes that Goulart is living in a dream world. He seems either out of touch with reality or very poorly informed. Public opinion is not with him and the tradition that political power should only be transferred constitutionally is very strong in the army, coup reports notwithstanding.

f. The biggest danger from this quarter is that the opposition may resort to some illegal act, giving Goulart the excuse to take over.

## NOTES

A. Ethiopia-Congo Haile Selassie has acceded to our ambassador's request and is rescinding his earlier decision to withdraw the 1,743-man Ethiopian contingent from the UN force in the Congo.

B. Communist China - Africa The Guinean ambassador in Peiping has it unofficially that Premier Chou En-lai will leave in mid-December for a tour of some Afro-Asian countries. He is to stop first in Egypt and then visit several other African countries including Guinea, Ghana, and Mali, Chou would be the highest ranking Chinese leader ever to visit Africa. (INTERCEPTS)

C. Indonesia-Philippines Two good sources have reported that President Sukarno plans to go to Manila this Thursday to confer with Philippine President Macapagal. No reasons have been advanced for the visit. Our charge guesses that it is an Indonesian move to head off Philippine recognition of Malaysia.

D. Venezuela The terrorists have struck again, this time firing six US-owned oil and gas pipelines near the northeastern city of Puerto la Cruz. The elections are still on for Sunday, and we look for a maximum effort from the pro-Castro terrorist organization.

E. Congo We now have word that 49 members of the Soviet Embassy, including dependents, left Leopoldville on Saturday aboard a Sabena flight for Brussels. They are expected to book onward passage for Moscow. It is reported that the Congolese will allow one Russian without diplomatic status to stay to look after Soviet property.

a. Cuban tents are now begin-

SAM sites--further evidence that
training of Cubans in operation of
SAM equipment has begun as scheduled.

b. High-altitude photography
taken this past weekend shows these
tents at six SAM sites in western
Cuba. These sites are in addition
to those at which we noted the pres-
ence of Cuban interpreters as we
reported on Saturday.

c. This training should be com-
pleted by next May or June.

d. Just before the training
started, we noted a series of moves
involving the relocation of eight of
the SAM sites.

e. The purpose, it appears,
was to shift the mission of the sys-
tem from an area defense of the
island as a whole to point defense
of specific targets, particularly
Havana. (Includes INTERCEPTS)

b. This is an earnest of the
desire of moderate Baathist leaders
in Damascus to preserve workable re-
lations with Iraq, partly as a
counterbalance to Cairo and partly
to preserve what remains of Baathist
influence in Baghdad.

c. Intercepts show at least
some Syrian troops will remain in
Iraq at the request of Iraqi offi-

d. Preparations had been under
way for these forces to withdraw;
retention of at least some in Iraq
is another sign that both regimes
hope to preserve something of the

a. Prime Minister Inonu's

c. Now the Peasant Party, one of the three in the coalition, has voted to pull out, and probably will do so as soon as Inonu gets back from Washington. Another partner, the Turkey Party, has wanted to pull out, and apparently has stayed in only because of pressure from the military.

d. A new coalition is at least a theoretical possibility, with a number of independents taking the place of the Peasant Party, but Inonu probably would not be prime minister.

e. The military are working for an all-party coalition. This way, they feel, they could keep tabs on the Justice Party, but the Justice Party is not likely to buy this arrangement.

f. As matters now stand, the military would take over the government itself before it would let the Justice Party form one.

4. USSR wheat

a. Soviet President Brezhnev has told the Iranian prime minister that the decision to buy wheat abroad was taken to avoid lowering reserves, which he has described as ample for one or two years. We think the situation is more serious than that.

b. This year's harvest was clearly very bad. The weight of evidence suggests that Soviet grain stockpiles have been far drawn down this year and are not sufficient to protect the country from another poor harvest.

c. Our estimate is that total grain production each year since 1958 has been well below that year's level of 125 million tons, while the population has continued to grow.

d. We have seen from intercepts signs of extensive slaughtering in anticipation of fodder shortages during the winter. This runs counter to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to build up the livestock industry.

e. We have also noted that the extensive wheat purchases weaken the USSR's gold reserves at a time when it hopes to expand its imports of machinery for a huge chemical fertilizer program.

f. In addition, we have seen signs of stringent measures to protect the grain supply, accompanied by public discontent in some areas over the absence of bread.

5. Communist China - Argentina

a. Peiping last week contracted for some 300,000 tons of wheat (cost about $20,000,000) from Argentina.

b. This adds to the 1,000,000 tons just contracted for with Australia, but is still far below the 5,000,000 tons the Chinese have normally imported in recent years. Additional suppliers will be hard to find.

c. A large sale, apparently involving some $56,000,000 worth of meat, is apparently also being arranged. This is interesting, not only for the sizeable foreign exchange outlay, but also for the concern it shows for improving the diet of the mainland's urban population.

d. The same caloric value could be obtained from grains at a fraction of this cost. (INTERCEPTS throughout)

6. Czechoslovakia-
   USSR

a. Czech President and party boss Novotny has gone to Moscow, evidently for economic talks, judging by the composition of his delegation.

b. Novotny's background of Stalinist excesses have put him on the wrong side of Khrushchev. They also have given rise to control problems, particularly in the fractious Slovak party where pressures for liberalization have made their mark.

c. Party problems and Novotny's leadership may thus also come under review.

d. A curious sign of the times is the fact that, although President Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential flag has remained up at the official residence. It might simply have been an oversight, but the symbolism will not be lost to the people in Prague.

7. Cambodia

a. Cambodia, as expected, has asked the Geneva co-chairman to call the Geneva conference participants together (in Djakarta) to discuss measures "to ensure the internationally guaranteed and controlled neutralization of Cambodia."

a. An Egyptain military message reporting to Cairo on operations in Yemen this past weekend indicated that poison gas (referred to as "ghurab" in Egyptian military traffic) was used against royalist tribesmen.in the northwest.

b. This is the first time we have noted its employment since last summer, although another intercept shows that the Egyptian command has continued to authorize its use.

b. Last year when this came up, the French were inclined to go along with some such idea.

c. They have indicated to us that they still feel Sihanouk should not be turned down, and Sihanouk is obviously hopeful that they will exert pressure on us and the British.

e. It operates fairly freely in the loose circumstances which now obtain in Brazzaville. Its activities may soon become a serious source of friction between the two countries.

F. Cambodia Cambodia is cutting its diplomatic representation abroad to a bare minimum as an austerity measure following curtailment of US aid. Sihanouk announced last week that this would be done, saying that missions in Communist countries would not be affected since those countries "protect" Cambodia. Curiously enough, among the missions being closed down are those in New Delhi and Rangoon. (Includes (INTERCEPTS)

# 1. Venezuela

a. The country's six presidential candidates have swung into the home stretch of their campaigns. So have the terrorists, who are still trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's vote.

b. There is little doubt that the terrorist effort has all-out Cuban support. Castro looks on Venezuela as his prime target in Latin America and would do everything in his power to prevent President Betancourt from finishing his term.

c. So far, the terrorists have tried to intimidate the candidates by harassing political rallies, bombing their party headquarters in various cities, and threatening them with assassination. They have tried to scare voters from the polls by creating a general atmosphere of lawlessness. Kidnappings, like the one yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault, are part of the pattern.

d. The government counterattack is under the personal direction of Betancourt, who is as determined to finish out his term and turn over power to a freely-elected successor as Castro is to prevent this.

2. South Vietnam

   a. We now have a fuller account from official US sources of the Viet Cong attack on two mountain villages mentioned in Tuesday's Checklist.

   b. This account makes it clear that the earlier press versions, which spoke of 1,000 missing villagers, were highly colored.

   c. Our present information is that the attack, in company strength, was successfully repulsed. The Viet Cong suffered some 30 casualties; government losses were six killed, three wounded and 39 missing.

   e. Yesterday it was announced that the carrying of firearms by anyone outside the security forces was forbidden until the elections are over.

   f. Some 3,000 reservists have been called up to protect the polls. Leaves are being cancelled and all security forces are maintaining a high state of alert.

3. Israel

d. As is usual in these cases, the villagers began to trickle back once the Viet Cong left.

e. This episode aside, we see a number of indications that the Communists will try to sustain the higher level of military activity they have kept up since the coup.

f. The Communist radio has called for more attacks in an effort to destroy strategic hamlets and "develop" Viet Cong forces. In support of this, Viet Cong communications traffic has been unusually heavy and has involved a large volume of high priority traffic and special alert patterns. (Includes INTERCEPTS)

a. We have some reason to believe that the Israelis are developing a surface-to-surface missile of their own.

b. A reliable clandestine source says that an Israeli representative is trying to buy US stable platforms for the inertial guidance system of a missile with a range of 300-350 miles. He wanted delivery in six to twelve months. There have been several earlier reports that

Israel is buying missile components in the US and England.

c. We think this missile program is independent of another Israeli venture: Tel Aviv's contract with a French firm, Marcel Dassault, for the development of a system which will be able to deliver a 1,600-pound warhead to a maximum range of 300 miles.

4. USSR-India

a. Moscow has promised the Indians to ship the equipment for one surface-to-air (SAM) training site early next month.

b. The Soviets had agreed to provide eight SAM sites. The rest will probably not be sent until the Indians have learned to handle the equipment about a year from now.

c. As we noted last Sunday, there are some Indians who have doubts about the Soviet willingness to live up to the letter of their military aid agreements with New Delhi.

d. They call into question especially the contract for the Soviets to set up in India a facility to assemble MIG fighters--an enterprise which has appeared somewhat impractical from the beginning.

e. We do note, however, that Soviet aircraft specialists working on the project were still in New Delhi in early November. (INTERCEPTS)

a. Ne Win has followed up his action in breaking off talks with the Burmese Communists by arresting over 700 of their number.

b. Ne Win had been trying to lure the faction-ridden Communists into a "national front." However, he found the demands of the Communist negotiators, some of whom had only just returned from long exile in Peiping, to be impossible.

c. This will probably lead to renewed fighting between the army and Communist guerrillas in the hills.

d. More trouble can also be expected from the rebellious ethnic minorities like the Karens and the

e. US officials on the spot doubt that the army, hobbled by poor leadership and its many political responsibilities, will be any more effective in dealing with the problem this time than in past anti-insurgency campaigns.

6. Cambodia

a. Sihanouk has signed an accord setting up regular air service between Cambodia and Communist China. A similar agreement with Hanoi is in the works.

b. These lines are significant largely as gestures by Peiping and Hanoi to bolster Sihanouk's sense of importance. Neither would be a paying proposition commercially and both could flounder before the first paying passenger enplanes unless rights to overfly Laos can be obtained. (Includes INTERCEPTS)

7. Greece

a. It looks more and more as if Papandreou, who squeaked through to a narrow upset victory over ex-premier Karamanlis in the 3 November elections, will not be able to form a government.

b. His party does not have a parliamentary majority, so he needs support from either Karamanlis' party on the right or from the Communists. The military has apparently been pressing Karamanlis to withhold that support. He does not need much urging.

c. The military has also let it be known that it would consider Papandreou's acceptance of Communist support as sufficient reason for a coup d'etat.

d. In addition to this military string-pulling, the royal family is also meddling--not for the first time. Should Papandreou fail to form a government, the palace intends to pass the mandate to Karamanlis, believing that he too would fail.

e. This would then open the way, the palace calculates, for a compromise premier more amenable to palace influence.

a. President Goulart and his opponents are keeping political tensions in Brazil high.

b. Comments by Goulart, that "social disaster" is sure if his program is not passed soon, have drawn sharp rejoinders from moderate and conservative figures and have fed rightist coup plotting.

NOTES

A. USSR Simultaneous activity this morning on the
Tyuratam missile test range, satellite tracking nets
and Soviet space support ships in the Atlantic prob-
ably represented an attempt to launch an unmanned
earth satellite. The launch apparently failed on
the pad or was cancelled at the last moment. It
may be tried again soon. (INTERCEPTS)

B. Rumania-US Rumanian officials are about to award
a US firm, Ferguson and Company of Cleveland, Ohio,
a $32 million contract to help build the huge Galati
steel plant. The Rumanians are pressing ahead with
this project in the face of Soviet efforts to dis-
courage it in various ways, most importantly by re-
fusing to underwrite the scheme to any substantial
degree.

C. Turkey The New Turkey Party has followed the
Peasant Party in withdrawing from the present three-
party coalition government. This means that the
coalition has to all intents and purposes collapsed,
even though no formal action will be taken until
Prime Minister Inonu returns from Washington this
weekend.

D. Thailand The Thai doctors attending Sarit now ad-
mit for the first time that the Prime Minister is in
critical condition. Our doctor agrees with this
prognosis. US officials in Bangkok believe that the
most likely successor would be Thanom Kittikachorn,
now deputy prime minister and minister of defense.
Thanom is not likely to last long, however, since he
is neither a strong personality nor a figure of great
weight in the military hierarchy.

1. USSR

a. TASS has finally announced that the USSR will conduct another series of ICBM firings to the Pacific during the period 2 December to 25 January.

b. Since our last mention of this subject, we have picked up indications that some of the firings this time may be made from operational launchers rather than from the Ty-uratam rangehead.

c. There has been unusual traffic on the strategic rocket forces communications link between the operational site at Plesetsk and Moscow similar to that which preceded the firing last October from Plesetsk to Kamchatka.

d. In addition, some intercepted telephone conversations have implied that the firing ranges would be different this time.

e. We also have some fragmentary evidence that the forthcoming firings may be the ooject of a special tracking or detection project. (Includes INTERCEPTS)

of National Liberation (FALN) will probably increase their efforts to disrupt the constitutional succession, which would be the first in Venezuela's history.

f. Meanwhile, in the wings are the military leaders who may well intervene if they find Betancourt's successor not to their liking.

g. Though President Betancourt has taken personal charge of the search to locate Colonel Chenault and those responsible for his kidnapping, his efforts so far have come to nought. The only news has been from a Caracas editor who had a call yesterday morning from a woman saying the colonel was safe.

3. Cuba-
   Venezuela

a. The discovery of a large cache of weapons of Cuban origin, announced by Venezuelan authorities yesterday, provides the best evidence to date of major Cuban support for Latin American subversives.

b. There is definite proof to support the Venezuelan claim. The three tons of weapons found include light automatic rifles and

(Cont'd)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

submachine guns identified as among those shipped to Cuba from Belgium in 1959 and 1960. There were also mortars, bazookas, recoilless rifles, and ammunition of US manufacture.

c. Communist documents seized by Venezuelan authorities earlier this month reveal that the equipment was destined for the Venezuelan Communists' paramilitary arm, the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN).

d. The cache was found on 1 November on a beach in Falcon State in the north, scene of the most active guerrilla effort. The Venezuelan government assumes that the weapons were sent from Cuba by sea.

e. Caracas will lay formal charges concerning the arms cache before a special meeting of Latin América Foreign Ministers scheduled for December. After that it will ask that the Council of the Organization of American States be convoked for consultation on the matter.

4. Communist China - Afro-Asia

a. More information on Chinese Premier Chou En-lai's Afro-Asian swing is beginning to leak out.

b. The Egyptians are expecting him on 8 December, according to the Algerian ambassador to Cairo.

c. The press in Mali says Chou, accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Yi, will visit Algeria, Mali, Ghana, Guinea, Somalia, Tanganyika, and Albania.

d. The Pakistanis have just informed our ambassador that they have agreed to a state visit by the two Chinese in mid-February at the conclusion of their two month tour.

5. Cuba

a. Another London shipping firm says it is willing to abandon its Cuban trade.

b. Embassy London has been advised by Papadakis and Co., Ltd. that it is prepared to keep its two ships involved in the trade from calling at Cuban ports when their charters run out next January.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 119

c. Papadakis is probably ask- ing the same price for its action as Basil Mavrolean did recently--removal of its ships from the US blacklist. Papadakis operates 19 ships totalling more than 200,000 tons.

d. Mavrolean's vessels account for almost half the present British tonnage calling at Cuban ports and are the largest single element of free world shipping to Cuba.

e. The outcome of Mavrolean's offer is not yet clear.

## NOTES

A. South Korea President-elect Pak Chong-hui's success in winning control of the unicameral legislature in Tuesday's elections improves prospects for smooth operation of the new constitutional government. However, political stability will still depend on Pak's willingness to rule with moderation. If he interprets this victory as a popular mandate to pursue an aggressive authoritarian program, he could provoke serious unrest.

B. Indonesia-Philippines President Sukarno's visit to Manila is on again for 4 December, according to the Indian ambassador to Djakarta. He assumes its purpose is to head off Philippine recognition of Malaysia.

C. Thailand Prime Minister Sarit appears to have taken a further turn for the worst. Our station reported yesterday that he was flown by helicopter to a Bangkok hospital from his seaside villa. Police escorts described his condition as critical and rumors that he had died spread through the city.

D. Rwanda-Burundi Prompt action by Burundi security forces appears to have halted the march of tribal refugees on Rwanda that we reported yesterday. There is little doubt that the refugees, who carried only a handful of modern arms and were poorly organized, would have been badly mauled by Rwandan troops if they had crossed the frontier.

1. Venezuela

a. Election campaigning ended at midnight, but boosters for the several candidates continued to mill about streets of Caracas in defiance of terrorist threats to shoot anyone who ventured out for the next three days.

b. The terrorists, it seems, were all but drowned out by the carnival air.

c. The FALN, meanwhile, is trying to bargain off Colonel Chenault for as high a price as it can, demanding variously release of all its comrades, of all women detained by the government, and of the six hijackers who have been returned from Trinidad to custody in Venezuela.

2. Sino-Soviet dispute

a. The Chinese Communists will have nothing to do with the idea of bilateral talks with the Soviets under present circumstances.

b. Chinese party Secretary General Teng Hsiao-ping, one of the select few in Peiping's ruling circle, recently told a group of visiting Latin Americans that such a meeting could accomplish nothing.

(Cont'd)

For The President Only - Top Secret


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 125

c. Teng put the issue of another meeting of world Communist parties even deeper into limbo by saying that Peiping would be in favor only when assured of the support of a majority of the world parties.

d. Moscow, for its part, has apparently stopped thinking about another gathering of world Communist party representatives.

e. The feelers it put out after the conclusion of the test-ban treaty were received coldly by some of the fraternal parties. They felt such a meeting could only make matters worse with the Chinese.

f. Indeed, Peiping saw this to be Moscow's purpose, and when the idea failed to take hold, the Chinese took it to be a setback for Khrushchev personally.

g. Their reaction to Khrushchev's subsequent call for a cessation of open argument was to press the offensive, and this they have been doing in roundly abusive terms since.

3. USSR

h. The forthcoming Afro-Asian visits by Chou En-lai and Chen Yi have awakened suspicions that the Chinese are in hot pursuit of a second Bandung-type conference--a more rewarding enterprise from their point of view.

a. Yesterday and on Thursday, we detected what we believe to have been operational training launches of standard 350 nautical mile submarine-based ballistic missiles.

b. Two and possibly four missiles were fired from submarines based in the Petropavlovsk area to the impact area at Klyuchi.

c. Seven similar instances have been detected previously this year, and there may have been others. (INTERCEPTS)

achieves independence on 12 December. This will fall under the jurisdiction of communications minister Oneko, who has well developed contacts within the Soviet Bloc.

c. TASS has already agreed to equip the new agency, and Kenyan requests for further financial and techincal help are being discussed in Prague and Moscow.

d. Kenyan journalists have been training in Prague and, on return, will find ready employment in the new agency.

a. Czech President Novotny returned from Moscow on Thursday after signing a renewal (for another 20 years) of the treaty of friendship and mutual assistance.

b. He apparently got little else out of Khrushchev. The final communique was conspicuously cool.

c. There were no Soviet concessions, nor were there the usual references to Czech "progress" or to public support for Novotny's leadership.

6. South Vietnam

a. The first suicide by burning to occur under the new regime was witnessed today by bystanders at a crowded intersection in Saigon where a young girl went up in flames.

b. A note she left behind said she was protesting the war of Vietnamese against Vietnamese. At the intersection are three villas which house the ICC delegations.

c. There were no Buddhist overtones.

d. Some think the Viet Cong encouraged her, but if they did, they did not write her script. They would have said it is the Americans who are fighting the Vietnamese.

NOTES

A. South Vietnam Plans are now afoot to shuffle
South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General
Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best
of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV
Corps) area. General Dinh, the ambitious Minister
of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin-
quish command of the III Corps area, and is not in-
volved in the current shuffle.

B. Cuba-USSR There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,
5,000 of these military, according to a bloc offi-
cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana. The
figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to
7,000. Some withdrawals continue.

C. Cambodia-Vietnam Sihanouk seems to feel that cut-
ting off his nose to spite his face was not enough.
Now he says he will formally recognize North Vietnam
if the US does not silence the Khmer Serei radio.
South Vietnam will cut Cambodia's primary access to
international markets via the Mekong river if he
does. (INTERCEPT)

D. Indonesia-Cambodia Sukarno apparently plans to go
to Cambodia on an official visit following his trip
to Manila. The Cambodian ambassador in Djakarta has
advised Phnom Penh that Sukarno plans to leave for
Manila on 6 December and directly from there for
Phnom Penh on the 10th. He will stay three days.

E. Coal and Steel Community Coal and Steel community
members at their next meeting on Monday will prob-
ably vote to raise community steel tariffs by an
average of nine percent. This would bring the tar-
iffs of each member into line with Italy's, the
highest in the community. Only the Dutch oppose the
idea.

F. British Guiana - Cuba GIMPEX, trading arm and
source of funds for Jagan's party, has worked out a
deal to supply the country's major electric utility
next year with fuel oil from Cuba. Texaco and Esso
have been the traditional suppliers.

G. Brazil-US A press report from Rio cites "well in-
formed sources" to the affect that Goulart plans
soon to invite Mrs. Kennedy to visit Brazil so that
Brazil can pay her the honors which it had planned
to render the late President.

H. Cuba-Morocco A three-man Cuban delegation is on
its way to Morocco to try to patch up relations
broken by Morocco because of Cuba's assistance to
the Algerians in their border war. (INTERCEPTS)

position. [HERBERT](3)(4) expressed the opinion that the US

who have already drawn up programs for social reform
within the countries.

MALONE also wrote in his memorandum that [HERBERT] (

should attempt to discuss the Cuban question with Attorney
General ROBERT F. KENNEDY as he believes the Attorney
General was a very strong minded individual and if he
made a decision, would carry it out [HERBERT] also stated
that he believed MALONE and his associates should also
talk with Senators HUMPHREY and MC CARTHY, both members
of the "New Frontier", who are also individuals who can
make a tremendous impression on President KENNEDY. [HERBERT](u)
stated that he would furnish MALONE some ideas relative

would not act in Cuba or commit US troops in Cuba, and

MALONE stated that [MAECHIN]^(5) indicated that there was a [CIA] plan in the formative stage relative to Cuba, and that he was hopeful that they would have something to work on soon which would give [CIA]^(4) more authority on which to operate. [MAECHIN]^(5) also indicated to MALONE that a military build-up can be expected in the Florida area, and that a minor one is already taking place at the present time at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo, Oriente Province, Cuba. [MAECHIN]^(5) stressed that out of necessity future operations against Cuba would have to take place from an off-shore area because of security of the operation. MALONE also wrote in his memo that [MAECHIN]^(5) told him to tell ALBERTO FERNANDEZ of Key Biscayne, Florida, to be patient and that before long, [CIA]^(4) would fully utilize his abilities and equipment.

MALONE also furnished on 3/30/62, a copy of his memo to ROBERT KLEBERG relative to MALONE's conversation on 3/15/62, with SERAFINO ROMUALDI of the Latin American Section of the AFL-CIO. In this memo to KLEBERG, MALONE wrote that ROMUALDI stated that President KENNEDY was still being pushed and pulled by the "Intelligentia," who were identified as ARTHUR SCHLESINGER and ADLAI STEVENSON, toward following a soft line relative to Cuba. ROMUALDI told MALONE that RICHARD N. GOODWIN of the US Department of State apparently was waking up to the fact that the future of President KENNEDY depends upon a strong, firm policy and the elimination of CASTRO and Communism in Cuba immediately. ROMUALDI told MALONE that his opinion of GOODWIN's present thinking was gathered from individuals who dealt directly with GOODWIN concerning Cuba.

MALONE wrote to KLEBERG that ROMUALDI also recommended that he, MALONE, and his associates attempt to get an appointment with Attorney General ROBERT F. KENNEDY relative to Cuba as ROBERT KENNEDY is the strong influence on the President and has been pressuring the President to get rid of what he calls the "featherheads"

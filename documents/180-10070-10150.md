Dick:

While the attached resume of Ms. Miriam Rudder does not reflect experience related to office duties, I know her well and certainly trust her. Therefore, I strongly recommend that she be hired for me to train as a mail clerk working along with Patricia Price. Again, as I indicated above, the most important thing to me in this instance is that I have the utmost trust in Miriam.

Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.

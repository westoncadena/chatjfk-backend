MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Activities of Dale SMITH

1. Attached is a newspaper interview with American Black Power advocate Dale SMITH, which was published in SÃ¸ndags Aktuelt, 7 July 1968, and which gives a fair description of SMITH's views as they have been expressed on other occasions.

2. SMITH mentions a television program which had been filmed but not shown by Danish TV. The program was, in fact, shown on the week the interview appeared; the title was "The Negro in Denmark" and a group of five American Negroes had a fine time sitting around a table in a dark, smoke-filled set meant to appear as a cafe, damning white America, capitalism, Russian communism, and most emphatically - Denmark, all with a fine disdain for logio or sequence of thought.

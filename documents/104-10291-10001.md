MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

VIA: Deputy Director for Administration

FROM: F. W. M. Janney
Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith

1.  (U) Action Requested: None; this memorandum is in response to your request of 15 May 1978 to provide you with a very brief rundown on Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith.

2.  (C) Mr. Smith was born in 1921, holds B.A. and M.A. degrees in History and has studied at the Ph.D. level in this field. He served as a Corporal in the U.S. Army (1943-46) and from 1946-51 he was an Assistant Professor of History at Dickinson College. He entered on duty with the Agency in September 1951 as a GS-09 and reached the GS-14 level before his retirement in June 1973. At the time of his retirement, he was assigned to the DIO/Western Hemisphere Division. He received the Career Intelligence Medal. Overseas assignments included Singapore 1954-56; Manila 1958-60; Buenos Aires 1962-66; and his last assignment, Mexico City 1969-73.

3.  (S) Apparently after retirement, he wrote a book, Portrait of a Cold Warrior, which he did not submit for security review or for DCI approval. His book was already printed in advance uncorrected proofs when the Agency first learned of its publication. It contained classified information; however, the Office of General Counsel advised us that it was the final decision of this Agency and the Department of Justice that we would not pursue civil action against Mr. Smith. In this sort of action you must prove damages. The Operations Directorate was reluctant for security and sensitivity reasons to point up those areas wherein we had been damaged.

4.  (U) In the event you wish to read further on this subject, we have attached papers furnished us by Mr. John Greaney of the Office of General Counsel.

# How CIA Agents Suffer From Secrecy

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 5

# By Joseph Burkholder Smith

WENTY-FIFTII college reunions are great occasions for letting the world know how well you've done, and mine was no exception. All my old classmates, it seemed, had become assistant secretaries of state or vice presidents of General Motors or had acquired some equally impressive titles. So it was a little embarrassing when they'd ask me what i was up to:

Not that I hadn't done well myself - I was at the time fairly high up in the Central Intelligence Agency. But I wasn't allowed to say that, 30 when they asked, I had to mumble something vague about being a civilian employee at Patrick Air Force base, an excuse that I could tell, conjured up images of genteel failure (too much drinking perhaps) in the people who heard it.

Not being able to impress my old classmates was a small wound, but it symbolizes an important problem for CIA agents. We live in a society where lots of people plan their lives so as to accumulate the greatest possible number of credentials of the sort that will wow their peers at reunions and similar moments. These credentials give many Americans a sense of identity and of security: CIA people are by no means immune to the desire to impress people with credentials, but their jobs are directly at odds with that urge. In that way and several others, we in the CIA have been deprived of the normal ego supports of the American life of our time, and how we dealt with (and didn't deal with) their absence from our lives has had something to do with how our agency has (and hasn't doned its job.

It wasn't just our status among our peers that suffered as a result of our work. Normal family life was a victim too. The CIA's Clandestine Services division has for years had the highest divorce rate of any organization in the government Part of the reason is that recruits of my generation of clandestine operators were instructed never to tell their wives what they were really doing. "Just say R's a question of national security," they told us when we had to take one of our frequent absences from home.

Of course, many men also discovered quickly what an improvement that ling was over the old "working late at the office" routine and took advantage of it. Still most of the marital problems came not from philandering but from the unspectacular, bitter toll that living under cover takes on people. OfNcers with good marriages might tell their wives in general terms what kind of work keeps them out at night but they have to insist that the wives give to hint The first things a CIA wife learns is never to ask another woman what her husband does, for fear she will be asked the same question.

CIA wives also have to join their husbands in keeping their children in the dark. When schools have programs in which the kids' fathers tell their classes about their father's Ing work, she has to help invent reasons why her child can't volunteer his father's participation When the men wants to visit his father's office, the way his friends date must try to ease his terrible feeling of rejection when his father tells him no. This kind of travail makes many women wonder if it's worth the effort.

## Talking to Yourselves

FACIA AGENT is stationed to Washington, he has to get used to being asked at every party, by every stranger he meets "What do you do? Personal qualities like kindness, good temper, or intelligence - even good looks and money - mean nothing in the nation's capital compared with where one stands in the pecking order. A CIA couple who maintain their cover are quickly selected out of any party they go to and end up in a corner talking to themselves.

CIA wives, particularly, feel this instant social failure deeply and resent it. Until the women's movement, most women were raised to channel their ambitions toward the areas of party-giving and cooking. When married to a CIA agent, they felt they were denied these things because of their husbands work, and their marriages got into trouble.

When CIA families go abroad they find their lives even more disrupted by status anxieties. The American official community, centered at the embassy, spends more time and effort than the Soviet AGD trying to discover who are the CIA families if a CIA officer is assigned to the embassy under the guise of being in the Foreign Service, the U.S. Information Service, or the Agency for International Development, the real employees of those organizations ferret the CIA agents out and then take pains to treat them as second-class citizens. The government employees who are "legitimate" embassy personnel don't speak to them at all. If they arrive at the embassy under deep cover, with no false identity, then not even the other CIA personnel speak to them.

The game of uncovering the CIA people is made simple for the "legitimate" embassy personnel by a number of means The State Department won't let CIA agents call themselves as a cover, Foreign Service Officers they have to say they're "Foreign Service Reserve" or "Foreign Service Staff officers. Real FSSA, as they're called, are fairly low-level and real FSRs are never in political jobs, so that CIA's people - listed as. FSS or FSR "political officers" are obvious to one and all.

In the same status-preserving spirit, the State Department used to publish an annual Biographical Register a who's who of the Foreign Service that included information on degrees, jets, and rourky pasty it warat ! 1973 and the murders of several CIA agents that Stato made the Register a classified document.

## Envy, Jealousy, and Distrust

HERE ARE several ways to deal with the problem of credentials One is to rise above the world of status anxiety. Another is to learn to laugh them off, even if they are painful Unfortunately, however, a more common way of handling the tradeoff between your cover and your status is to give up more of the first to get more ef the second In foreign capitals CIA agents often have been anxious for the matters and the diplomatic community to consider them


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 6

# 14-00000

Important that they've made their secret jote obvious-
which has not only douet hom cary, Jealousy, and distrust, but has made it very hard for them to do their job of intelligence gathering property.

"Do you know that CLA people are pald double salari to serve abroad?" the new polical over in Stageporn sald to me when I showed أحد قلة to family around the Singapore Swimming Club of the Sunday after he arttred. "They got paid twice as much as you or I do They get paid for their cover jobs and then paid again for their banky panky worl That's why they live better tasa we da"

I felt flattered that I was holding my cover well enough to be told his secret, and I only wished what he was saying were trita.

But it was an Impression that was understandable, if erroneous CIA officers did serre la covers that were lower In rank than their real jobs, and both on the job and off, they didn't live lives consistent with the rank they were pretending to have. For reasons of their jote, agents cultivate contacta la the local government and other diplomatte mbetons In circles far higher than people of their cover rank ever have a chance to meet And they least on reating the kind of houses to which their CLA rank entities them, as well as demanding and receiving a lot of speelal perqubi

ly new friend was wrong about the double salaries, but all the CLA officers he had seen abroad would certainly have given him the impression that he had about that a of compensation

In particular, most CIA staden chiefs are not content to Uve la quarters much less and than the ambasador's offlclal residence. In many countries, this makes sense - the CIA bas liaison responsibilities that are officially recognized by the ambassador and the State Department Butthis is not appreciated by the lowerlevel employees of the embassy, it it's told to them at all. Resentment of the chief of station's Maryle bubbles up

La the past, many chlets of state made no attempt to hide thetr preference for dealing with the CLA station chiet rather than the ambasador sometices bamuse Vigy owed a great deo to : CL mich nay have stolen the election for them or financed the coup that hat put then in pajover. In any case, CIA starton chiets have always felt they could tot entertain Were rera in hovels. It would be dett menul to we prestige and tursu of the United States, they arque, if they did not have the rank and accoutrements accolt of the forelmes with whom they deal One station chieft knew In the 13309 80 to prada promotions by tits gambit It has rerved many a CLA thread well la regard to the hous לבבות Sapa Lab Dewat laterval gives a virid account of the permites y personal enjoyed in Vietnam They had their own hotel clas, swimming pool, and cara la the 1500 14 Ana it da it was customary for CIA eff cers to baro chauffeurs tones the rationale that you incedel somebody around to guard CLA care agalast looting Since the cars were gorprenent property, the gar and oll and maintenance costs, as well as the chauffeur, were paid for out of the station's housekeeping funds People who were listed as lowly attaches were often seen drivingi around in die unmarked, chauffeured cars, which drove the Foreign Service Officers tato freadies of envy.

## "We'll Entertain Ourselves"

EVEN WORSE, perhaps, than using perquisites to fend off the pangs of status anniety is CLA people's tendency to huddle together. If the rest of the world thought we were nondescript Army officers and the like, well, we knew who was and want who and could play the game with each other. The other.embassy personnes won't invite us to their parties? We're too low on the diplomatic list to get lovited to the Important functions given by other embassies and by officials of the local government! Well entertain oursedres.

Conscientious CLA officers try hard to curb this practice, which after all is a breach of nearty overy tenet of good security, but they fall more often than they succeed.

In the days when our national purpose was more clearty delmed, when we would, la the words of John F. Kennedy, pay any price and bear any burden la defense of the free world, it dida't matter so mach if the cover of CIA personnel was a littlo in la some countries, the prestige of tho agency was even higher than h i was at home, enormously higher than it has been at home for the last three years In the Philippines in the late 1909, the CLA was so well regarded that members of the Army Counter Intelligence Corps used to try to recruit Filipinos by passing themselves oftas CIA agents. Today, the open life style of a station chief can lead to his death, as it did for Hichard Welch in Athens

Welch was killed by the gun of an anti-American assasala but the giua was put into the main's band by all the defenses against the dilerama of covert life that fra described Welch lived in a house inherited from past station chiets everyone in the embassy kure his true position علظلمة blography appeared in the Biographic Register, which could be found la any library.

Alee Wetch died the robster was crercinlly clasified but that doesn't mean mean an end to the problem CLA personnel will always feed a strain from having to pretend to be nucb Jess succester than they really are even if they love their work and believe in it deeply, they'll still feet pangs That's human nature, and wille we ought to curb the obviousness of CIA agententides, to some extent we're just got to deal with it

On way to de a de that is to treat CIA agents sympathetically. Those are obviously people who have sacrificed something to work for the agency, and who depend to an inordinate extent on having stable relationships with their co workers, since they can't have stable relationship with anyone else The main thing is sa agenta ile - practally the caly thing, for many how he's treated at Langley, whare de stands there.

CIA Director Adm. Stansfield Turner.

So when Adm. Stansfield Turner quickly tired 820 Clandestine Services officers last year, my initial approval (some of those fired, I thought, must have been the people who make zou decide to leave tas CLA in 11173) gave way to misgivings. It's true that the greaust physical hazard many spooks have ever faced is the danger of cho'ting on the pit of the olive in their martinis. Itut the greatest hazard we all face in life te pot physmal danger, it's having something eat away at our soul. No one bas to be a clandestine operator, of course, but once ha 11, he is deprived of the normal means of sustaining his sofinagathit prevails in our society.

I don't can Turner should have kept on Licompetents! I'm sure that after those 820 firings everybody elza at Lanelay feit bitter and frightened. These are not, after all, people who have anything else to fall back on, and they need a lot of rapport from their organization. Turner has to use these people, and if he wants to use them effectively to ought to find a way of lofting some go while making the rest feel secure.

Mr. Joseph B. Smith has made an outstanding contribution to CIA opera-
tions for the past 21 years. He has consistently received strong/outstand-
ing efficiency reports in a wide variety of assignments, including two in
the Far East (Singapore/Malaya and Manila) and two in Latin America (Buenos
Aires and Mexico City). At Headquarters he served as Chief of the Malaya/
Australia Branch in FE Division, on the CA. Staff, in WIl Division on the Ven
ezuelan Desk and the Division CA Staff, and in OTR on a rotational tour.

Mr. Smith is a recognized authority on Covert Action. While with OTR
he was commended for his efforts in completely revamping the CA curriculum.
In close coordination with the CA Staff he organized two totally new CA
seminars, both of which evoked a very positive response. He also received
praise for organizing and conducting a training course for military officers
destined for Saigon where they were to conduct psychological warfare opera-
tions. s. In Argentina he worked in liaison with local services on Covert Ac-
tion operations. This work with liaison was rated as outstanding. He de-
veloped a long-time agent in one of the services to a point where the pro-
duct was considerably improved. Political contacts at all levels developed
by Mr. Smith in Mexico City have been instrumental in developing dissemin-
able intelligence. In all his assignments his rating officers have consis-
tely pral praised his imagination, flexibility, enthusiasm, perception and
professionalism.

Mr. Smith's career has been one of exceptional achievement and he has
made an outstanding contribution to the Agency's Covert Action program and
to Agency training. His record of commendations and sustained superior per
formance of duty of value to the Agency throughout his career make it fitting
that he he awarded the Career Intelligence Medal upon erit TACHO SHEET

17 June 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services Career
Service Board (Panel A)

SUBJECT : Joseph B. Smith - Recommendation for
Promotion from GS-14 to GS-15

1. Mr. Smith joined the Headquarters Training Branch of the OTR Operations School in October 1966 specifically to assume responsibility for Covert Action training. He spent the first few months in a thorough study and review of all CA courses previously given in OTR. This was a long and complicated job, compounded in part by the public compromise of a wide range of Agency CA activities. In closest coordination with the CA Staff, Mr. Smith devised a totally new and different CA curriculum, consisting of two short seminars for middle and senior grade officers - one called a Covert Action Operations Seminar and one a Politics Workshop. These seminars, emphasizing the integrated nature of CS operations, have evoked a very positive response, confirming the soundness of Mr. Smith's creative efforts in revamping CA training in this fashion.

2. As a corollary to the main duties cited above, Mr. Smith has also successfully run, in conjunction with FE Division, a Psychological Warfare Operations Course for military officers being assigned to MACV/SOG in Saigon. Finally, in the CA field, Mr. Smith has provided tutorials, as requested by various area Divisions, to a number of Staff and Contract Agents and to foreign liaison representatives in such fields as black radio, youth and student operations, veterans organizations, and methods of countering Communist propaganda.

3. In February 1968 Mr. Smith was asked to assume responsibility as Tradecraft Advisor and Coordinator for the Operations Support Course, a critical block of instruction for (primarily young

and inexperienced) CS clericals headed for overseas assignments where they may be called upon to assist case officers in operational support tasks. Although, strictly speaking, this teaching and coordination task was outside Mr. Srnith's normal purview and main area of expertise, he accepted this additional responsibility with exemplary willingness, and then proceeded to discharge it smoothly, energetically, and effectively. In addition to managing an extensive live problem, the Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that presentations by a number of instructors result in a balanced and coherent coverage of all operational subjects in the course. This entails the coordination of efforts of several senior and experienced instructors, all under the nominal aegis of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thus, demands a great deal of finesse and tact. Mr. Smith has not only fulfilled this difficult role in a highly efficient manner but has also drawn on his own long field experience for pertinent and meaningful contributions to the course.

4. During Mr. Smith's tour with OTR, he was requested to participate as a member of a Survey Team in a review of the effectiveness of the Propaganda Group of the CA Staff. In a 30 June 1967 memorandum of appreciation to the Director of Training, Chief, CA Staff commented as follows on Mr. Smith's work:

> "Throughout Mr. Smith participated in a most effective professional manner bringing to bear his extensive background in the Clandestine Services. His direct and objective approach to the problems considered in the course of the survey made his contribution to the overall Team effort invaluable. The Team report, which I am still in the process of discussing within the Staff, will be of considerable value not only to this Staff in our future planning but also, I feel, to the future posture of the covert propaganda mission of the Clandestine Services; thus, I heartily commend Mr. Smith for his effective participation with the Survey Team in this effort,"

5. In his last two fitness reports Mr. Smith has received a "Strong" rating and the Chief of the Operations School as reviewing official has added his opinion that Mr. Smith has done his job with distinction and with credit to himself and his career service, citing the assignment to OTR as a first-rate example of quality in rotational tours. While Mr. Smith passed on his expertise through the training process, he also enhanced his own versatility through involvement in the various training activities cited above.

6. In recognition of the foregoing, it is felt that Mr. Smith is qualified to carry out the duties of the GS-15 grade for which he is recommended. Mr. Smith has been in grade 5 1/2 years.

Smith has worked under my supervision on two occasions, once in the Philippines and most recently in the Office of Training. Both jobs were in the CA field where Smith is, I believe, one of the Agency's most experienced officers. My own view is that Smith made an outstanding contribution to Agency training, particularly in CA, during his recent tour with OTR.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Training

SUBJECT: Statement of Appreciation - Mr. Joseph B. Smith

1. We wish to take this means and opportunity to express formally and for the record the appreciation of the Covert Action Staff for the work of ur. Joseph B. Smith as Chief Instructor for Covert Action of the Headquarters Operations School in the Office of Training during the past two years.

2. As you know, Mr. Smith worked closely with the Covert Action Staff in totally revamping the Headquarters covert action training program. It was through his efforts that the new intensive Covert Action Operations Seminar was introduced as a technique of instruction to replace the outdated Covert Action Operations (Familiarization) Course. He carried his basic concept one good step further in introducing the Political Action Workshop as an advanced forum for studying and applying covert action operational and planning techniques. Mr. Smith's work has also laid the groundwork for more specialized follow-up in covert action training.

3. The enthusiastic reception and endorsement of these two courses, the quality attendance by Division officers, and the participation by senior Division officers as speakers, attest to the need for new courses and the success of these endeavors.

4. Those of us who had the opportunity to work closely with "Little Joc" learned to appreciate his vitality, flexibility and personal commitment to the success of these training innovations. The contribution they have already mado, and will continue to make, to the Agency's training program are testimony to the role that he played in dovising and implementing them.

1. In response to my request of 2 May 1967 your Office did an extremely fine job in organizing and conducting the training course for the military officers who will be going to Saigon to work with Agency personnel in psychological warfare. Special note should be taken of the efforts of Mr. Joseph Smith, of your Office, who organized the course and provided not only the impotus for the program but also the catalysis for a very enthusiastic response from the students.

2. The group of trainees have been requested to provide a critique of the course after they have settled into their jobs in Salgon in order to determine how well the course material fitted their assignments. We will forward copies of these critiques as they become available.

3. Again let me express my appreciation for your very effective support.

Subject is a mature soundcofficer who has an excellent grasp and undörstanding of local politics and its ever changing profile. Most of his career Subject has specialized in the CA activity and this experience has proven very useful to the Station. During this reporting period he was given added responsibility in supervision and a change of pace with operational duties in the subversivo, leftist and oxile field. He accepted the new challenge and performed well. Just rocontly the Station has completed major reorganizational changes which rosulted in Subject once more concentrating his attention on CA and Moxican government matters. He has done exceptionally well at developing contacts in Government circles and we are taking advantage of his ability to do this to develop long lasting and meaningful relationships. (This beyond official liaison contacts.)

Subject is responsive to guidance and direction and is one of our more imaginative officers. Most recently he has indicatod a desire to rotire, after completion of his present tour in August 1973. Subject has performed well at this Station for over three years and his departure will be most felt in the area of his specialization.

I am personally sorry to see this friend leave the Agency and I know further that it will be hard to replace his abilities in various operational fields, including that of good contacts in the community hare. He has served the Agency well hore and in many other posts and his leaving is a loss to us.

Subject is now well into his second tour at this station and has not lost any of his momentum. He charges into his work daily as if it were all a new challengesand new experience. His past fitness reports from this station have all reflected his professional approach to the job and he continues to merit those plaudits. He is conscientious, dedicated and a team worker. He takes direction well and takes great pride in meeting deadlines. One of our more imaginative officers who is effective.

Yet, with all of this, he has not progressed in the organization as he should have. It has been recommended that he be considered for promotion and/or a chance in a command job. The station is presently considering some reorganization which will give Subject an opportunity to manage and direct activity which will be diversified and a change from the specialized jobs ho has held in the past. This will be another excellent test for him and we are optimistic in that he will handle this new assignment with the same degree of expertise that we have learned to expect from him.

Our pending re-organization would find him with considerably increased responsibility, which is a good indicator of how wo feel about him.

Subject, a senior officer in respects, has been at this station for the past 20 months as the responsible CA and Political officer. His past fitness report covered very thoroughly and accurately his ability to meet, develop and recruit assets that are important to station's objective. He enjoys his work and the challenge of being on the spot. He is a thoroughly experienced officer in his field and although forced to specialize for years, we must start thinking of more responsible and more diversified employment for this fine officer.

He is conscientious, dedicated and a team worker. He takes direction well and takes great pride in completing his obligations on schedule. One of the more imaginative officers of the station who is aggressive and effective. He handles his financial responsibilities well and has a good appreciation for the expenditure of official funds.

I was particularly impressed with Subject during his recent activity re the MAR disclosures. Subject cannot be credited for the disclosures but he can be given full credit for exploiting these events. He quickly put to use all of his assets. He personally prepared material for passage to the press. He supplied information for coverage in other papers in the hemisphere. He coordinated and furnished guidance to other Latin American stations on this subject. In all, he worked -continued

He has a good sense of politics, and we have a few operations which are devoted to finding out what the COM won't tell us and what the political section probably can't get at. He has a good way with people and has made some interesting acquaintances which, in themselves, greatly increase the sensitivity of the station.

alluded to above, means that Subjoct is not able fully to

flair in this field. What we have here to do is dono well
under his able management.

For one reason or another, I think largely because of
his having been in more or less specialized jobs, although/
sonior ones, rather than having been in a command position,
Subject has lost ground in promotions, having been in grade
since December, 1962. I should like to see him promoted
in this position or, if this is difficult, to see him given
a chance in a command job which might qualify him for
promotion.

Subject has his goals clearly in mind and has proceeded about his business with full confidence and perseverance. He is conscientious, dedicated and a team worker. Subject has gained the confidence of his supervisors and his subordinates have accepted him as one of the group. He has recently experienced some unusual operation problems where he was required to handle the termination of some very delicate assets. He organized, planned and handled the terminations personally in a very professional and successful manner. He was commended for this work by both Headquarters and Station management.

He has developed political contacts at all levels and has been very instrumental in developing disseminable information in this manner. He has quickly moved to replace assets which were terminated and by his efforts will fill in the void in a minimum amount of time. Subject enjoys meeting people and conducting operations. In the future, he will be forced to spend more time in managing his section due to administrative changes now taking place in the Station. He takes directions well and can be depended upon to fulfill all his obligations on schedule. He has an excellent command of the Spanish language and he is definitely cost conscious in the projects which he handles.

Of special note is that Subject was one of the first officers to quickly retool his section when given a new requirement to fulfill. He responded immediately and in so doing once more indicated his desire -continued

3. COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Concur fully with above and would add that Subject is one of the Station's most aggressive and effective development/contact officers. In what has been an almost complete reorganization of the Station and the termination or redirection of most of its assets, Subject has probably moved faster and more effectively than any other section. Perhaps even more notable, his development of new assets and potential assets has more than kept pace with the termination of those who have outlived their usefulness. While he is very thorough and effective in all of his undertakings, a tendency to go off on tangents has a slight effect on his overall efficiency. This is probably due in large -continued

Mr. Smith lives covertaction -- his imaginative and disciplined/ mind comes forth with many operational concepts and ideas ranging from simple, quite routine matters to complicated and carefully shaded activities. It is to be expected that within this enthusiastic outpouring, practical details of implementation are sometimes buried, In these instances, Mr. Smith quickly trims his sails and comes forth with the needed realistic approach. In short, he is a fine operations officer, more competent and at ease in real as against planning or policy situations.

As indicated in the last Fitness Report, Mr. Smith assumed responsibility for Covert Action training presented by this Branch in the wake of comptomise of a wide range of Agency CA activities. Quite apart from all the operational consequences of these public disclosures, there were also, of course, concomitant ramifications in the training field. Following careful study and examination of the new situation, Mr. Smith devised, in closest coordination with the CA Staff, a radically new and different Covert Action curriculum. The existing comprehensive courses on youth and labor operations were discontinued for obvious reasons. In place of these and the part-time Covert Action Operations Course, Mr. Smith developed a new, full-time, three-day Covert Action Operations Seminar for middle and senior grade officers. This inten- sive seminar, stressing the integrated nature of CS operations, was designed as a basic core around which skills-oriented seminars or workshops could be built to deal with such topics as propaganda operations, election operations, use of agents of influence, etc. To date, in line with this concept, a Politics Workshop has been created to provide training in the assessment, recruitment, and handling of assets among key interest groups, including political parties.

The resonance which these new courses has evoked confirms the soundness of Mr. Smith's creative efforts in completely revamping Covert Action training in the (cont.)

Concur. Mr. Smith has done his job with distinction and with credit to himself and his career service. His assignment to OTR is a first-rate example of quality in rotational tours. At the same time he has given a good deal to the training mission, I think it also fair to say he has gained professionally from the rather wide exposure to disciplines other than CA which he has handled extremely well.

Agency. In design and content the new courses reflect thoughtfulness, imagination, and realism--a combination of traits only too seldom encountered.

As a corollary to the main duties cited above, Mr. Smith has also successfully run, in conjunction with FE Division, a Psychological Warfare Operation's Course for military officers being assigned to MACV/SOG in Saigon. Finally, in the CA field, Mr. Smith has provided tutorials, as requested by various area Divisions, to a number of Staff and Contract Agents and to foreign liaison representatives in such fields as black radio, youth and student operations, veterans organizations, and methods of countering Communist propaganda.

In February 1968 Mr. Smith was asked to assume responsibility as Tradecraft Advisor and Coordinator for the Operations Support Course; a critical block of instruction for (primarily young and inexperienced) CS clericals headed for overseas assignments where they may be called upon to assist case officers in operational support tasks. Although, strictly speaking, this teaching and coordination task was outside Mr. Smith's normal purview and main area of expertise, he accepted this additional responsibility with exemplary willingness, and then proceeded to discharge it smoothly, energetically, and effectively. In addition to managing an extensive live problem, the Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that prosen- tations by a number of instructors résult in a balanced and coherent coverage of all operational subjects in the course. This entails the coordination of efforts of several senior and experienced instructors, all under the norminal aegis of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thus, demands a great deal of finesse and tact. Mr. Sraith has not only fulfilled this difficult role in a highly efficient manner but has also drawn on his own long Field experience for pertinent and meaningful contributions to the course.

Mr. Smith occasionally handles Branch-wide administrative tasks and in my absence functions as Acting Chief, Headquarters Training Branch, to my complete satisfaction. At such times he has exercised supervisory responsibilities well. He is cost conscious and makes effective use of personnel, space, equipment, and funds.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

SECRET

In summary, Mr. Smith is a mature and responsible officer, keeps things nicely in perspective, and has a good sense of priorities. In tackling problems he strives to make molehills out of mountains, which is a refreshing change; in short, a dedicated and intelligent officer and, withal, unfailingly cordial and cooperative.

AFR 21 9 27 AM '67.

Since his assignment to Headquarters Training Branch of the Operations School, Mr. Smith has been principally engaged in a thorough study and review of all courses in Covert Action previously given in OTR. This has been a long and complicated job, the difficulty of which has been compounded by the necessity, at least in part through public events, to plan and project a total revision of instruction in the CA field. As a result, Mr. Smith has not yet had the opportunity to teach. This will come shortly, however, when a new course begins on 8 May. The "Strong" rating given him here is based on the excellent work and thoroughly professional approach he has taken in all of the preparatory work he has undertaken. He has been eminently successful in establishing useful new relationships and in maintaining his old contacts in the Clandestine Services for the purpose of laying a solid groundwork for high quality training. In addition to his responsibilities in OTR he has been regularly consulted by the CA Staff in a survey of one of its activities. This is fine testimony for the regard in which he is held outside the confines of his present job. The prognosis for a very effective performance in all of his teaching assignments is excellent. He has no supervisory responsibilities and is average in cost consciousness.

Subject has been under the direct supervision of this rating officer for a period of 14 months. This report is being submitted because of the transfer of the employee. For the last 6 weeks of the period covered by this report Subject was under the direct supervision of the COS because of the absence from the Station of this rating officer. Any differences of opinion with respect to the caliber of Subject's performance during the last six weeks will be reflected in the reviewing officer's comments.

During this period, as in the preceding period, Subject carried out all of his assigned duties and responsibilities in a highly professional and thoroughly competent manner. He continued to show a good deal of initiative and imagination in dealing with the liaison services on day to day matters. He demonstrated a keen sense of the internal political situation and he made maximum use of his contacts to elicit a large amount of disseminable information. Subject took over one new operational project during this period and he was able, because of his deep knowledge and understanding of the operational techniques employed in the CA field, to improve on the quality of the agent's product. Subject is an able and fully qualified officer who acquired a good deal of expertise about local operating conditions and then proceeded to apply his specialized knowledge and past experience to the Station's advantage. He has a great capacity for creative.

During the period under review, I had the opportunity to follow this employee's activities closely and can attest to his professional and imaginative handling of key assets. He corrected an earlier occupational fault found in many CA officers of a lack of cost consciousness, by cutting back on costs without adverse results to the operations concerned. During the one year under my observation, this employee performed highly satisfactorily.

He is both imaginative and resourceful and he uses his extensive knowledge of the internal political scene and his fluency in Spanish to the best operational advantage. He has initiative and he is persistent in carrying things through to a conclusion. He has an excellent facility for written communication. His operational and positive reports are clear, concise and well presented. He requires a minimum of guidance and direction. He responds very well to supervision and he accepts comments, suggestions and criticism in the constructive light in which they are presented. As a supervisor he has been able to obtain satisfactory results.

Subject's only weakness is that he tends to be less cost conscious than is desirable and unless his activities are circumscribed he is apt to allow his fertile mind and enthusiasm to get out of hand. Summed up, Subject is a highly professional and experienced officer who has all of the necessary operational and intellectual abilities to meet the requirements of the job.

I would have rated Subject officer approximately the same. In the past eight months that I have observed him in action, he has demonstrated an ability to get things done in a professional manner. He is, without doubt, the most professional and effective senior case officer at this Station. It was a pleasure to work with this officer and he will be sorely missed after his departure in August.

Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

This report is submitted due to the reassignment of the supervisor. Subject's performance remains as before. The Rating Letter of Specific Duty No. 1 was lowered from "0" to "S" for the simple reason that the goal in large measure has been achieved," i.e., a substantial reduction in costs but with a concurrent improvement in the net product-- a not inconsiderable achievement in that this is a joint undertaking with the local service. Specific Duty No. 2 lists three unilateral CA projects rather than four as described in the last report. This is due to the termination (on Subject's recommendation) of one of these projects.

There is little change over the previous report. Subject remains eager and aggressive and his enthusiasm for his assignment has not been dulled by the everyday frustrations and difficulties of doing business and living in Argentina. Subject's political action project was reactivated during this period with the return to Buenos Aires of the principal agent. This activity shows promise of making an important contribution to understanding the political tides at work in Argentina. Subject has developed a long-time agent in the liaison service (and recruited his wife) to a point where the "take" has been considerably improved. Subject's project management remains good and his reporting is both timely and in depth.

Subject supervises an American Staff Agent under deep cover in which effort Subject exhibits a high degree of competence. This officer continues to show an admirable cost consciousness which can be demonstrated in his management of a large and important CA liaison project; the costs to the Agency of this project have been reduced about 65% since subject assumed direction while at the same time improving the end result. Subject's Spanish continues to improve and he has no difficulty in understanding and in speaking with Argentines who have no English.

Subject has obviously established effective rapport with his agents and his Argentine colleagues and friends. This is in part due to a genuine interest on Subject's part in these people, their country's problems, and their culture. Subject remains responsive to guidance

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

From fairly close observation of his work I agree generally with ratings and comments of supervisor. The rating of "outstanding" on his work with liaison was justified in his last report because of the exceptional job he had done in developing this relationship. While he has continued to maintain it at a high level, there is some question in my mind whether a rating of "outstanding" is still justified. He is definitely a strong and active officer, handling a heavy load of liaison and independent operations. A well-rounded judgement of this officer should, however, include the statement that he sometimes rushs ahead a bit too precipitously and enthusiastically, and is inclined to gloss over operational details which can be important. He is effective

in his written work, more so than in his oral presentations which tend
to be somewhat rambling. He is a cheerful and outgoing person who has

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action.

Subject remains the eager, aggressive, and intelligent individual described in his last Fitness Report. During the year under review, Subject was assigned case-officership of two agents taken over from an officer who departed PCS. One of these agents is in an area new to Subject--economic action and economic reporting. In total, Subject is case officer of four active projects plus one that is temporarily inactive as the agent is absent from Argentina. Also, Subject is the supervisor of one American Staff Agent under deep cover. Subject handles these varied assignments with a high degree of competence and indicates a versatility of high degree. Subject's project management is good and his formal reporting to both his supervisor and Headquarters is kept current and done in depth.

This officer has consistently shown a cost consciousness during the period he has been at this Station (24 months). In addition he has an ability to relate cost to production which has resulted in almost halving funds spent for his CA liaison project while at the same time improving the product--and with the cooperation of the local service.

Subject's language competence (Spanish) is sufficiently fluent to permit him to engage in extended professional conversations with agents and others who have no English.

Subject in an aggressive, eager, and intelligent person who knows what he wants to do with and where to take his projects. In the case of the project with the local service, Subject inherited an expensive project over which little control had been exercised in either effective utilization of funds or the actual operations. After analyzing the project to determine the state of assets, capabilities, etc., Subject ingratiated himself in a highly commendatory way with the Argentines concerned to the end that Subject's ideas and positive cooperation are now sought on a daily basis. This has resulted in greatly improved project management and, better, more demonstrable results for the money spent.

Also, during this period Subject developed and recruited one new agent, a leading political scientist with access to important political leaders. In addition Subject inherited a project in the motion picture field which he has developed into an effective mechanism which now promises to reach into the newspaper field.

In addition to the above three projects, Subject is case officer for two staff agents who between them handle four projects. Subject has had these responsibilities for less than three months and during this period he has handled these assignments proficiently.

Subject's language competence (Spanish) is proficient; he is able to converse meaningfully in Spanish with persons of intelligence interest who have no English.

I am in general agreement with the supervisor's assessment of this individual, whom I have seen fairly frequently. He is extremely active and aggressive and has moved ahead rapidly into new activities in both the liaison and unilateral field. He has only recently taken over the direction and supervision of two other case officers so it is too early to know what his abilities in this area are, but it is in this direction that he should work for broadening his career potential.

Subject has no important weaknesses. His aggressiveness and eagerness have at times led to hasty action that might have resulted in professionally embarrassing results. On the other hand, these very qualities resulted in a recent and important recruitment. Subject is responsive to guidance and direction. He reports fully and within time limite.

Mr. Smith was head of the Venezuela Desk at the beginning of the reporting period. He left this position shortly thereafter in preparation for an overseas assignment, with another branch of WHID. During his duty with WH/1, Mr. Smith was a strong asset. With his previous operational experience and his innate good sense, he supervised the Venezuela Desk in a most effective fashion. This was particularly evident during the Presidential visit to Venezuela and Colombia in December 1961. The effective management of the Headquarters aspects of the visit called for a well-coordinated, efficient and intensive effort by all concerned. Mr. Smith and the personnel under his supervision measured up quite well in this situation.

This employee was new to Wi and served only about three months under the supervision of the undersigned. He brought wide experience and background in CA work to the Branch due to his past experience in other components of KURARK. He was applying himself industriously to the task of learning about the WH area and specifically Venezuela, for which country he was the desk officer responsible for FI as well as CA work. His performance was excellent and can be expected to improve with more familiarization with the area.

Daring the period from the rating officer's departure in Oct 1961 until Mr. Smith wo resssigned to another Branch in Feb 1962 in preparation for an overseas assigament, he demonstrated high competence in all of his duties, thereby confirzing the rating officer's expectations in the last centence of Section E.

# TRADING REPORT

Spanish Basic Reading, Speaking, Writing I

-100- hours, part time , 16 January 1961 - 24 March 1961 -6 students

Student : Joseph B. Smith Year of Birth: 1921

SOD Date: September 1951 Grade: 08-15 Office : CA Staff

COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHODS

This is the first phase in a three-phase basic sequence of 30 weeks, each phase lasting 10 weeks.

The general aim of the course is to enable the student to use the spoken language with moderate facility and accuracy in a large number of everyday situa- tions while providing a basis for further learning of the language either by actual use in the area or by further formal study. The three major objectives of this phase of the course are to develop an ability: (1) to adequately dis- tinguish and pronounce the sounds of the language; (2) to use appropriately a small quantity of Spanish sentences and expressions; (3) to comprehend normal speed spoken Spanish in a limited number of everyday, non-technical situations.

Classes are held 2 hours per day, 5 days a week, requiring a minimum of 10 hours of preparation per week. To receive the maximum benefit from this course each student should plan to devote at least two-thirds of the class preparation time doing drill in the language laboratory.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

Student progress is evaluated primarily on oral recitation in the form of drills and free conversation based on memorized material. In addition, several tests are given during the course. This student's rating is indicated by the asterisk.

| Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory | Excellent | Incomplete |
| - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - |
| | | 30 | 3 |

It is regrettable that Mr. Smith will not be able to continue in the course at this time but increased office duties do not permit it. Mr. Smith had made a very profitable start in Spanish in this course.

# FOREIGN LANGUAGE APTITUDE AND EXPERIENCE REPORT

DATE OF TESTING

The category checked below is an interpretation of the scores made by the person named above on a battery of foreign language aptitude tests. The relationships between test performance and subsequent training performance of trainees in Agency language training courses are indicated by the graphs next to the aptitude categories. The graphs to the left are for women and the graphs to the right are for men. From these graphs you can read for each aptitude category the probability that a person in that category will perform in an Agency foreign language training course at an average or better-than-average level. For example, 22 percent of the women who obtain an aptitude rating of "8" can be expected to be average or better in course performance, while 5 percent of the men with ratings of "8" can be expected to be average or better in course performance. A man needs an aptitude rating of "8" to have about the same expectation of success in language training as a woman with a rating of "8." At the other end of the scale, 80 percent of either men or women who obtain aptitude ratings of "2" can be expected to do average or better-than-average work in training. The differences in relationship are due to differences between men and women in both training performance and test scores. On the average women are somewhat higher on both.

Since many things other than aptitudes enter into the determination of training course performance, in any class of students there will usually be some whose performance will be better than would be expected from their test scores, just as there will likely be some whose performance is poorer than expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION, PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, and other factors should be considered in selecting people for language training and in interpreting language training results. For example, the number of languages previously studied or learned and the amount of academic and nonacademic language-learning experience are factors not measured by the tests but are indicative of probable success in learning a foreign language. Whether such experience was in the same language as the one to be studied or in a different one is, of course, an additional relevant factor.

Mr. Smith has demonstrated both competence and versatility since his assignment to CA/PROP. With no prior experience in the area, he was assigned to WH affairs and has quickly developed both a surprising knowledge of the problems of that volatile group of countries and an excellent rapport with members of the Division (which, on several occasions has indicated a strong interest in securing his services when his release from the staff can be arranged). Assignments are completed with dispatch and in good order.

The rating of 3 with regard to the proposed campaign on Neutralism-Nationalism reflects only that we have not yet got underway in this admittedly difficult and controversial field. The sum of research which Mr. Smith has done in this field leads him to the present conclusion (in which undersigned concurs) that unlike most of our other campaigns this will have to be conducted on a selected country basis and differently tailored for each.

During the absence of the rating official Mr. Smith has acted as Branch Chief.

SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. A-vity or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Subject is an exceptionally able political action officer. His capacity for grasping a rapidly developing political situation quickly and for making on-the-spot decisions is quite unique, and he would be a powerful addition to any station with a challenging political program. He is not always able to separate the significant from the insignificant and therefore tends to over-report. He is also inclined to operate more as a singleton than as an integrated member of an operations team. He has been quite successful in exploiting PP contacts for FI by-product. Additional training does not appear necessary at this time.

In preparing this report, careful consideration was given to the guidance in FS Field Dispatch No. 20-40 which recognizes the principle of rating the individual against the group, and establishes an "average" rating as being an entirely satisfactory performance. The supervisor, however, considers this fitness report to be in keeping with that guidance.

Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

He is a capable handler of agents, and has particular potential in the political action field. He has proven especially effective in a special election project in which he handled and developed numerous high level contacts. No particular weaknesses were observed. Subject is well qualified for senior operational assignments, in either PP or FI, and is recommended for promotion.

COMMENT OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

HALSEY, ROCHON and I have carefully reviewed this Fitness Report in order to comply with division policy of avoiding overrating. We are satisfied that TCOHILL, who has been given a high rating with respect to specific performance characteristics, fully merits such rating. During the fourteen years I have been with the Agency, I have had the opportunity to observe personally a good number of political action operation officers. Additionally, I have worked closely with TCOHILL during the current 1959 Philippine election. I have no hesitation in stating that I regard him as an unusually qualified officer for political action in the field. I believe also that he should be promoted as soon as practicable from GS-13 to GS-14.

SECTION I7

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

SUBJECT: Training Evaluation
Security Information
Communist Party Operations Course, Advanced Training Division

Student's Name SMITH, Joseph B.
Course No. 19

Division and Branch FB-5/PP
Grade GS-12
Age 32

The Communist Party Operations Course is a specialized two-weeks' course designed to provide adequate background and understanding of the World Communist Movement, and to increase the effectiveness of staff personnel charged with the planning and conduct of operations against these movements. The emphasis is on essentials, the generally valid aspects of Party policy, tactics, administration, organization, and action.

A combination of lectures, seminars, and written assignments is utilized, and the evaluation is based on the observation of the instructional staff. The supervisor is cautioned that this evaluation should be considered subjective in nature and applies only to the two weeks' period of the course. In those cases where no comment is given for one phase of activity, it does not imply that the student is deficient but only that the instructors do not feel that they have sufficient basis upon which to place a meaningful evaluation.

1. Student Performance in the Classroom:

Mature comprehension of the World Communist Movement and the varied aspects of its theory and practice. A developed feeling for current relationships between "national" Communist Parties' practices and the World Communist Movement; including its organization, strategy, tactics, and operations.

Superior comprehension -- in his area of assignment he was especially effective in his group of CP operations and tactics.

2. Willingness to Share Own Experiences or Thinking.

Freely expressed ideas when appropriate to the subject.

3. Ease of assimilation in the group - Pleasant, cooperative relationship:

Pleasant but reserved.

The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth existing policies of concern to you while integrated and to reiterate certain rights and obligations which derive from your true status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:

1. An-an-employee of this organization, at the present graule and salary of 08-14 $19,771.00 per annum, you will accept cover employment with another instrumentality of the Covernment (hereinafter referred to as "your cover facility") effective of of 21 May 1969. You will, insofar as consistent with your basic responsibility to this organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies of your cover fucility, in order to appear as a conventional member of that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being effected as a FER-4/7 at a calary of $17,209.00per annum.

Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the conventence of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of your cover facility. If you request termination of of your overseas assign-went solely for your own conventence, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organt to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your oversean poet of duty, you will not be entitled to re-turn travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expение. If you request termination of your overseas8 assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by thie organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for coune copier the regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of ita expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependente, from the continental United States to such overseaé post of duty.

regulations of your cover facility except when you are directed for operational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations of this organization.

4. Salary and allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the extent that they do not exceed the salary and allowance payment due you on the basis of your grase level with this organization. If such cover payments are less than the scount due you, the difference will be paid to you by this organization. if such cover payments exceed the amount due you, the excess amounts will be remitted to this organization at intervals to be designated by the Office of Finance. Computations hereunder will be based on the aggregate gross amounts due and received. That portion of retirement contributions withheld by your cover facility which exceeds the retirement contributions applicable to your organization salary will be deducted from the gross amount of the overpayment. Upon integration, the payroll office of this organization will establish the date on which you would normativ receive a regular step increase from your cover facility. Failure to resort a grade promotion received from a a cover facility does cause errors processing regular step Increases. Regular step increases, incorrectly processed in such manner, should be reported immediately to this organization. To eliminate this problem, any grade promotion received from a cover facility will be re-ported immediately by you to this organization's payroll office through channels showing both the old and the new rate and the effective date. All salary difference payments and adjustments will be reflected on earn-ings statements.

5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments of such status.

Additionally, while serving in the United States, withholdings shall also be made for District of Columbia or State income tax, when applicable. You may claim reimbursement for excess income taxes paid on overt tax returns by reason of taxable income from your cover facility exceeding the taxable income due you as an employee of this organization.

c. All annual and sick leave which is accrued to your credit at the time of integration will be transferred to your cover facility. While integrated you will be permitted annual leave, sick leave, home leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organization. Upon termination of your integration, your unused annual leave, sick leave, and home leave will be transferred to your credit with this organization and your leave record wiil be reconstructed as of the beginning of the leave year in which you return to this organization, as explained in the Handbook on Leave for Special Situations. Serving in an integrated capacity does not permit the carryover from one leave year to another of an annual leave balance which exceeds the ceilings authorized by regulations of this organization and the Federal leave law. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave, upon your "resignation" you will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization, including any income taxes withheld by your cover facility in order to receive credit for such annual leave.

6. You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all information which you may obtain by reason hereof, unless you are released in writing by this organization from this obligation. Violation of such secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the espionage laws, as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Training

SUBJECT: Appreciation: Joseph Smith

1.  With your approval Mr. Joseph Smith, of OTR parti-
    pated as a member of the Survey Team which during January - March 1967 reviewed the effectiveness of the Propaganda Group of the CA Staff. This involved 30 full Team meetings, inter- views with 57 CS officers, various specific inquiries, and numerous drafting sessions.

2.  Throughout, Mr. Smith participated in a most effective professional manner bringing to bear his extensive background in the Clandestine Services. His direct and objective approach to the problems considered in the course of the survey made his contribution to the overall Team effort invaluable. The Team report, which I am still in process of discussing within the Staff will be of considerable value not only to this Staff in our future planning but also, I feel, to the future posture of the covert propaganda mission of the Clandestine Services; thus I heartily commend Mr. Smith for his effective participation with the Survey Team in this effort.

3.  I would appreciate your conveying my thanks to Mr. Smith.

MEMORANDI FOR: D/FE/PC

SUBJECT: Covert Psychological Warfare Conferences Attended by Mr. Joseph Smith

1. Between 18 January and 26 May 1952 your consultant held a group of sixteen Secret conferences on specialized techniques in covert psychological warfare with particular reference to the Far Eastern area. These conferences amounted to a series of reorientation and developmental meetings in which persons actually on the job at CIA in OFC capacities could review their own doctrine, talents, and opportunities for serving the Government and the Agency in this field.

2. The topics covered included: a survey of the goals sought through covert activities of the U.S. Government; the basic bibliography on covert operations; the action response of target groups; media vehicles and the cultural terrain; specific covert psychological warfare techniques; the intelligence need for CPW; the operational vocabulary of Marxism; psychiatry and CPW; propaganda analysis; content analysis; press techniques of the Chinese Communists; covert economic warfare and CPW; personality problems in covert operations; basic doctrine on passive resistance; and a review meeting.

3. In difficulty and in seriousness of approach, this series of conferences corresponded to an advanced praduate course in an American university. It was a mixture of the seminar and lecture techniques.

4. Mr. Joseph Smith immediately made himself one of the outstanding participants of the group. He brought the capacity of a reflective and richly educated mind to this new field and demonstrated a real talent for seeing the opportunities presented by novel and unconventional methods of attack upon Communism. Not only did Mr. Smith learn a great deal himself; he contributed substantially to the intellectual participation of the other members of the conferences in the common tasks.

SUBJECT: PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE

1.  The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate data on all personnel. The new system will aid in implementing Agency policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel with desired education and experience for vacancies which may occur. It is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics for planning and management purposes.

2.  The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those factors in which the Agency is interested. Although the information is, in a large measure, already reflected in previous forms submitted by you, it is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves to bring your education and qualifications record up to date.

3.  Your cooperation is requested in completing the questionnaire as thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative Officer within the time allotted.

In writing a comment on his Fitness Report in January 1973, I spoke of what a loss he will be to the Station. Because of overlap problems, he will have retired soon after the new COS arrives and before the new DCOS has come. It is typical of him that lie has offered to perform introductions to some of his contacts even after retirement. He will be in Mexico and, while the Station must be careful to protect him in his new status, he probably will think of the Station first when he runs on to things of interest.

C. Graduate Study (continued)
Work Iroject #1

A. Project Synopsis

1.  The strength and vulnerability of Korea as an independent nation.

2.  Location - Johns Hopkins University, Paltimore, Md.

3.  I was the sole worker employed

4.  The political peography seminar was concerned in 1847-48 with areas of maximum change. Hembers of the seminar conducted studies of india,loland, Mewfoundland, Ceylon, Sinkiang, Korea.
    a. cach member made a deep-level study of the area of his choice. I chose Korea.

5.  Principal sources used by me were: USAMG Reports, all avail- atle background studies, interviews with Koreans stationed at Carlisle, (Carlisle Furracks ANG School) and with Miss Phyllis Johnson, reporter who was in Korea 1945-46.

6.  Te material covered mostly the years 1945-46-47, and was fairly complete for South Korea. I was unable to get informa- tion on North Korsa, nor would the Army give me political in- formation other than that officially published.

7.  Nethods used were historical and political because of my Previous training, Statistica were used wherever tonsible.

8.  Length of study-Sept. 1947-00cpt. 1948.

9.  Findingo and concluzions

a I made an analysis of Korean physiographic features; in- cluding edaphic as well as usual climatic and topographical factors.

1) I attempted to find the physical potential for the suc- cessful maintaining of Korean independent national existence,

2) Conclusions such cbviously favorable factors as Korean Zeninsular situation were nullified by other space relationz which made Korse vulnerable to Ruscian and Chinese attack.
   I found also that the soil was not adaptable through qut Korea for the practise of the nation's most thoroughly learned economie technique-rice culture.

b. Secondly, I was a complete check on the resources of the Zorean economy, as far as I could. The limitations imposed by censorship made it inossible for de to correlate Horth Korean industrial activity with South Korean agricultural activity as completely as I could have otherwise done.

1)Conclusions: The country would have to be industrialized to overcome the problem of overjogulation.

The Moront people ina not shown in the past any sieni- ficant evidence of the ability to operate a democratie govern rent.

10. Ky study was not used by any government agency.

11. My study was published, in part, under the title "The Koreans and their Living Prace", in the Korean Review, Korean-America Cultural Association, Sejt.1549.

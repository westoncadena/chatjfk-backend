Reference: DIR 38898, 8 October 1957

Action Required: None, information only.

1. In accordance with reference, there follow details of Subject's case. Attachment A is a memorandum furnished to the local COACID which reviewed the derogatory information in Station files on Subject. Attachment B is a paraphrased copy of the ODACID cable to Washington recommending a favorable decision in his non-immigrant visa case.

2. By virtue of Subject's youth, his record to date, and his promising future, he was listed as a JIKEEL target in June 1957. Contact was established with him in about August 1957 as a consequence of his non-immigrant visa application, and about six meetings have been held with him since that time, ostensibly for the purpose of fully clarifying his visa status. When and if Subject obtains his visa, PRQ Part I will be forwarded according to established JIKEEL procedure.

3. For Headquarters information, the fabricated information mentioned in paragraph 2B of Attachment A is that reported in HKH-954, 5 January 1955, and HKH-943, 28 December 1954. AMPUTEE admitted to Humphrey I. EBEREIN on 26 August 1957 that this information was fabricated.

2. A. On 26 August 1957, a source within SIN, considered usually reliable, when queried concerning the reports from official sources of Ortodoxo-Communist collaboration and specifically concerning the past with the Communists involving Subject and others mentioned in paragraph 2A above, said that these reports were false (inexacte) and had been fabricated to denigrate the most active and realistic opponents of the BATISTA regime. Subject denied that the Ortodoxos ever cooperated with the Communists. He claimed that he had never met Carlos Rafael RODRIGUEZ sr. for that matter, any of the top Communist leaders except Lazaro Pena, who was once pointed out to him in Marianao 0107.

3. A. An un-evaluated report dated 16 July 1951 from a source whose reliability was described as fair stated that Max LESNICK is a Communist sympathizer and a very good friend of Lionel SOTO, editor of Vanguardia Cubana and Communist leader in the University of Habana. The report concerned LESNICK's candidacy for the office of Secretary General of Arventino Ordoñez.

B. Subject, when asked if he knew Lionel SOTO, said that he knew him but that he did not share his views. It is noted that the same report mentioned that it was very doubtful if the Juventud Ortodoxa was going to send a delegation to the Youth Congress (Communist) in Berlin, a statement hard to reconcile with the presence of a Communist sympathizer as a candidate for Secretary General of that organization.

4. A. An article in Hoy of 17 September 1952 reported a protest against a SIM raid on the Casa de la Cultura. Included in the list of persons signing the protest were names of many prominent Communists as well as that of Subject.

B. Subject admitted signing this protest and stated for the record that he signed in good faith as an anti-franquist and not as a Communist sympathizer.

5. A. An article in Prensa Libre of 12 March 1954 reported declarations of the Cuban Committee for Guatemala against the aggression against that country. Subject's name was listed among the signers of the declaration as a member of the Committee.

B. Subject stated that he signed the declaration in the sincere belief that Guatemala was a democratic country and that democratic forces had to defend that country against forces which would maintain it in economic subjection and political backwardness. He said that many non-Communists of like belief also signed the declaration. He added that when ARBENZ went behind the Iron Curtain it became clear that Guatemala really had been in danger of becoming a Communist beachhead.

6. A. An article in Hoy of 28 January 1953 reported that Subject was a member for the Juventud Ortodoss of the presidium of the Conpresa Hartlamo por los Derechos de la Juventud and published a photograph showing subject at the spaziora' tablet. Another article in Hoy of March 1953 reported that Subject and several other youth leaders appeared at Hoy offices with a declaration signed by the Consejo Permanente of the Congreso Martiam. The Congreso was described as Communtetedozinated by the writer of the near andum to the Visa Section dated 9 November 1955.

B.. Subject described the Congreso as an opposition maneuver against the Government in which many Cuban youth institutions participated, including the Comaninists. He said that he, himself, participated in the Congreso strictly as a representative of the Juventud Ortodoxo in opposition to the Government in no sense as a collaborator or ayapathiser ith the Comaririste. Regarding the visit to Hoy offices, Subject said that the group in question visited many newspaper offices, not fust that of Hoy.

7. Subject prefaced his remarks by stating that he had recognised tha Communist danger as early as 1950. He brought several documente purporting to show his attacks on Corsunisa. The consente are attached, and pertinant extracts therefrom are set forth below in translation. Subject requested that the documents be returned when need tre tham no longer existed.

A. Extracts from "El Pensamiento Politico e Ideologico De La Juventud Cubana", dated 1 July 1950, signed by Max LESHICK Nenendes, Ciro PUNARTECA Diss, Oscar CRUZ Mir, Salvador LEW, Omar FORGES, Jose SALAZAR and Josquin SALOMONI

(1) (page 13, criticising BATISTA's collaboration with the Communists) "Around the middle of 1937, the Communist Party, alleging as a public pretext that BATISTA has ceased to be the center of the most reactionary feroes not only is returning to legality but also is lending to the regtes in power all ite political beeking and is mobilising the working masses in his support."

(2) (page 14, more critician of BATISTA and his collaboration with the Courantsts) "The Arst raneral olections held following the promulgation of the new Constitution, to which BATISTA vent as presidential candidate of the old political foross and of the Cossmanist Party, served only to 'civilise in its exterior asperts the power which that man had been exercising over the country for more than five years....."

Specific information from Cuban Government sources regarding Ortodoxo-Communist pacts were later, admitted to the local CAS as fabrications. LESNICK states that he signed the Pro-Guater:ala declaration against big foreign business domination of Latin American affairs as did many other Cubans. He states that he is only acquainted with student Communist leaders at the University of Habana. He denies that he collaborated with the Communists during the past or present and brings published articles dating back to 1950 which indicate his anti-Communist stand. His name appears in the Soundex for questioning.

SUBJECT: Mario Daniel RIVADULLA y Carcedo

Comments: (Dr.) Jose Antonio VELALX Aguilera arranged an introduction to RIVADULLA on 8 July, and he has since been seen by Palinger on several occasions.

The 5 January 1955 report was from AMPLECT (HKI-954); the 6 November 1952 report from AELU (HKK-27); both were appraised as 3. RIVADULLA, who was denied a visitor's visa in November, 1955 largely on the strength of those two reports from the Station, is still interested in obtaining the visa and willing to clarify his status *vis-a-vis* the JB and POP with the local ORICID.

It is believed this report will assist in answering that portion of the latest periodic requirements-list, forwarded under HKI-W-2379, concerning RIVADULLA.

PLACE & DATE ACQ: Habana, prior to 8 July 1957

SOURCE: Qualified American Observer (5). Appraisal of Content: 2.

1. In a private conversation on 8 July 1957, Mario Daniel RIVAVILLA y Carcedo, a national leader in the youth sector of the Inscribed Orthodox Party, made the following comments:

   There is no Communist penetration of the Orthodox Party youth organization even although there are probably a few "fellow travelers" or Communist-oriented persons in that organization; if so, however, they have no influence. No split or agreement between the Orthodox youth organization and the Juventud Socialista (JS, Cuban Communist Youth Organization) now exists or ever existed. Relations with the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP, Cuban Communist Party) and the JS were outlawed in Cuba; however, all of the opposition parties and their youth sectors participated with Communist representatives in opposition meetings and shared a platform with them. This procedure on the part of the other oppositionists had nothing to do with the Cuban Communists themselves, but was carried on for a strictly tactical maneuver used by each opposition group. It is a Communist practice to use vilification of the names of members of other opposition groups in their manifestos and declarations at times. In fact, RIVAVILLA's name was so used by the Communists on a number of occasions without his knowledge; and he had repeatedly to clarify this to the press to clarify that he is not a Communist, and never has been active in Orthodox Party affairs since 1952. He believes that Communist ideology and economic theory is not applicable to the Cuban situation and that it holds nothing of value for Cuban politicians.

2. At the time of the 1954 general elections, the combined numerical strength of the Orthodox Party youth was between 70,000 and 100,000. Since that time, however, the Partido Autentico Revolucionario (the Authentic Revolutionary Party) led by Sergio ILLAda, and the 26 of July Movement under the leadership of Fidel CASTRO Ruz, have drawn to them a considerable number of Orthodox youth, so that the 26th July group is at present considerably stronger. RIVAVILLA will shortly resign from the Orthodox youth organization and affiliate himself with the Fidel CASTRO Ruz forces. On the other hand, Rolando (William) DROZ Oches, a national leader of the Inscribed Orthodox Party, does not have the revolutionary qualities needed for the latter's appeal to Cuban youth. It is reported to RIVAVILLA that the several independent sectors of the Autentico...

Field Corments:

1.  Several previous reports from this office, dated 6 November 1952, and 5 January 1955, from independent sources, and whose contents were considered as possibly true, said that a pact had been made between certain leaders of the PSP and 33 on one hand, and the Orthodox youth on the other hand, whose purpose was support of PSP activities. (RIVADAVILLA and HEROS state Ones, national leaders of the Orthodox youth, were named as being either Communists or sympathizers of the PSP within the Orthodox youth who met. This office has not been able to confirm the existence of the reported pact.

2.  The newspaper *El Mundo*, 13 December 1956, carries a statement to the press made by RIVADAVILLA and Cesar Ouros 102003, in the capacity of Orthodox youth leaders, in which they deny authorization to the 33 to use their names upon a document signed by Cuban Communists, that asked for guarantees for 26 of July Movement personnel in the Sierra Maestra and a *foco*--Rivas. RIVADAVILLA and HEROS state that while they fully support the message of the document, they refuse to join in signing it with those (i.e., the Cuban Communists) who do not make the same petition for the Hungarian revolutionaries who died by the thousands in Budapest. They conclude by saying that their press-statement clarifies their support of guarantees for the 26 of July Movement, their desire for a just solution to Cuba's political problem, and their sentiments against those (i.e., Cuban Communists) who still have not satisfactorily explained the Soviet crime committed in Hungary.

3.  The newspaper *Avance*, 30 April 1957, and *Informacion*, 5 May 1957, contain a statement to the press from RIVADAVILLA, in which he says that during a recent television round-table program his name was included with others in remarks made by a member of the Autentico Party, as being accused as Communists by the MAC. The labor leader Eusebio Mujal Barniol, a participant in the round-table, replied that he didn't know about the others mentioned, but he did not believe RIVADAVILLA was a Communist, but would investigate the matter. After ridiculing MUJAL in the role of private detective, RIVADAVILLA says that he doesn't have to reiterate his democratic convictions or his anti-BATISTA stand, nor repeat that he is not, nor has ever been, a Communist or anything like one. He concludes by challenging MUJAL to find any Communist antecedent in his record.

4.  RIVADAVILLA announced his new PRP affiliation in the local press during the last week of July 1957.

MARTINEZ stated he left Cuba by air for the United States, where he remained
for several days visiting a number of universities; he departed from the
United States for France via SAS and, upon his arrival in France, took a
train direct to Warsaw. While attending the Festival, he was invited by
members of the Chinese delegation present to visit Communist China. MARTINEZ
accepted, traveling across the USSR to China, where he remained for a short
period of time. He returned to Cuba via Czechoslovakia, Austria, France, and
Spain. His complete trip lasted approximately six months.

Field Comments:

1.  Office files reflect that MARTINEZ-was one of three Cuban delegates of
    the Cuban University Students' Federation to the Fifth National Student
    Congress of the U.S. National Student Association (UCSA) held in Bloomington,
    Indiana, in August 1952. The Cuban delegates denounced dictatorship in
    general and succeeded in having the Congress pass a resolution condemning
    the BATISTA dictatorship specifically. For, 3 March 1953, contains an
    article showing Subject active with Ramiro VALDES Vivo, and
    Aramis TABLADA, among others, in organizing a "Congreso Martiano por los
    Derechos de la Juventud.,10 June 1954, contains an invitation

    a source whose reliability had not been determined, indicated MARTINEZ
    was an active Cuban Communist Party leader who had traveled to Communist
    China and the USSR.

FIELD INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: Cuba

SUBJECT: Views of Rafael GARCIA Bárcena on Cuban Political Situation

REPORT NO. HXH-1477-

DATE OF INFO: 6 May 1957

PLACE ACQUIRED: Habana

DATE ACQUIRED: 6 May 1957

DATE OF REPORT: 6 May 1957

SOURCE, SOURCE EVALUATION, APPRAISAL OF CONTENT:

Sources Qualified American Observer (A) from an Opposition Political Leader (F).

Appraisal of Contents: 3

1. Rafael GARCIA Bárcena said that recently he had been in conference with Robert GRANONTE, leader of one of the three factions of the Partido-del Pueblo Cubano (Ortodoxo) and that he had been asked to try to bring together the three factions of the Ortodoxo Party: the groups of AGRAMONTE, OCHOA, and Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling.

2. GARCIA Bárcena would like to maneuver himself into the position of being the Ortodoxo candidate for President of Cuba in the 1958 elections. He said that it is too soon to attempt a reconciliation in the Party and that his own tactic is to maintain contact with all the opposition political leaders in the hope that at a propitious time he will be the one person about whom no faction would have any strong objections. Subject said there was no first-class political party in Cuba but that the Ortodoxos were the least objectionable and the name of the party had not been tarnished as was true of the Autenticos, nor was it a party of petty politicians seeking power. Of the three factions in the Ortodoxos, OCHOA controls the party political machinery, AGRAMONTE controls the excitable and revolutionary group in which youth and students are prominent, and MARQUEZ Sterling leads only a small segment of the party. He said that the "Ortodoxo Youth" will not present a difficult problem within the party once they can be convinced that the way to power is not through violence but through participation in the 1958 elections. The Youth are strong enough to veto a presidential candidate but probably will not take a leading part in selecting one. He did not feel that MASNICK or Francisco Carons had a great deal of influence among the Youth at present and said that Mario IVA TULLA was the most respected of the Youth leaders. This group eschews violent revolutionary action.

3. GARCIA Bárcena pictures himself as the person who can influence the Ortodoxo Youth to abandon revolutionary methods, and toward this end he is writing a series of articles for such widely-read magazines as Potencialin which he points out to the Youth that times have changed since he (GARCIA Bárcena) led the Youth in the assault on Camp Columbia. He said that his complete reversal of policy is going to confuse Cuban youth, but he feels it is the only way to bring unity to the party and prepare for the elections of 1958. He fears that May will be a month of increased violence in Habana but, once the revolutionaries realize that they have

not accomplished anything, they will be more amenable to suggestions to prepare for the elections in 1958.

4. GARCIA Barcena feels that the Ortodoxo Party has only about a 25 per cent chance of winning a Presidential election -- not because it could not command enough votes, but because the current regime of terrorism would not dare permit an opposition party to come into power. They have gone too far on the road to government by assassination, imprisonment, and robbery to give up their power, he said. Nevertheless, in his opinion there is no alternative to an election. He feels that, even if the Ortodoxos cannot elect a President, they may elect a number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. He will propose that Ramon BARQUIN be run as a candidate for the Senate even if BARQUIN is still in prison at the time of the elections. He did not believe that there were any legal obstacles.

5. Regarding Fidel CASTRO Rus, he said that CASTRO was an impetuous and perhaps even an irresponsible leader, but one who could not be ignored in any new government because to the youth of the country he represents an ideal and for this reason no stable government could be formed without him. He said he differed with CASTRO on the matter of military principles. He does not believe that CASTRO will be able to attract any significant defections or support from the Army. He said that CASTRO originally believed that, if he could only establish a beachhead in Oriente, show strength in that area, whilst at the same time show the Army that he had supporters in Habana by agitating here, he would be able to find support in the Army itself, particularly in Camp Columbia. This was CASTRO's big mistake, according to GARCIA Bárcena. Since CASTRO cannot take Camp Columbia, he is isolated. GARCIA Barcena did not believe that CASTRO was ultra-nationalistic but that apparently some of his followers were from the tone of some of the propaganda of the 26th of July Movement. GARCIA Bárcena, because of his previous influence among Cuban youth, apparently sees himself as the person to offset or balance the impulsiveness of CASTRO if his group ever comes to power.

Field Comments

Rafacl GARCIA Bárcena was one of the founders of the Partido del Pueblo Cubano (Ortodoxo) but separated from it because of differences of opinion with the leaders Roberto AGRANONTS and Jose PARDO Llada. He had been a University professor and instructor of military psychology at the Cabaña Fortress and at one time had considerable following among Cuban youth and many friends in the Cuban Army. In Ar11 1953 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for conspiracy against the BATISTA Government but was released by amnesty in June 1954. Since then he has refrained from revolutionary activities and has been occupied with writing mildly anti-Government articles for various publications and maintaining contact with the principal leaders of the opposition parties.. In a forthcoming article to appear in Bohemia, he will exhort the youth of Cuba to give up their violent revolutionary activities and to seek power through elections in 1958.

"The loader appears to be Fidel CASTRO, who from abroad is directing over 50,000 youths throughout the island. Other leaders are:

*ECHEVERRÍA of the Federación Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU; University Students Federation).

*Ampare CHAPLE Trujillo, FEU leader, national director of the Juventud Socialister (IS, Communist Youth group), tho has just been elected president byrne School of Philosophy and Letters.

*Gustaro MARIN of the Morialento de la Naciba, who is closely connected with the Communists of the University.

*OBA BORGES

*Max ASNIC of the Juventud Ortodoxa Insurreccional.

*Or Bardo CORONA, long-time Marxist but proudo Orthodon direstor of insurrectional line.

As a prelude to the commemoration of the fall of student BATISTA, they will again mobiliss national opinion, this time in a mited front of struggle with the sugar, port, and transportation workero, whom they say they have on their side.

"Communist and oppositionist youths are spreading defeatist rumors to the effect that the year 1956 vill be tragio in national history, the political situation is very dangerous, a feeling of insecurity reigns.

On the walls of houses Marxist mottoes such as 'Abajo BATISTA' and '26 de Julio' and waging a campaign of proselytism in favor of the so-called Revolutionary Emigres,' this is, the mobilization of Fidel CASTRO.

2. The source of a previous report on plans for a revolutionry coup on 26 February 1956 has furnished the following additional information:

"The conspiracy is continuing to develop feverishly, and there is a danger that the revolution may break out any time before 26 February."

"Among the revolutionary leaders are Juan FURTAS Yero and Roberto YLEON Lemus. Also involved is Eufemio FERRERA Cri. who has returned to Cuba. Almost all the revolutionary leaders who were in exile are now in Cuba. It is possible that (or) Aurelio SANCHEZ Arango may also be back here."

"The meetings held at the farm of Fidel CASTRO's cousin near Olira de Molana have been attended by officers and enlisted men of the Army and the National Police. Last week important meetings were held on Thursday and Saturday, attended by Fidel CASTRO, his brother, and his sister."

"The preparation for the revolution has started with the placing of bombs and petards.. The person who placed the petard in the National Capitol last Friday was Juan RODRIGUES."

"The revolutionary plotters include in their violent plans the elimination of different persons connected with the BATISTA regime. One of the first to be eliminated is (General) Rafael SALAS Canisaros, Chief of the National Police, who it is expected will be eliminated by police officers connected with the conspiracy. Another possible victim in Eusebio MIJAL."

"Since 1. February a group of revolutionaries from Habana have been in Camaguey, including one man from Calabazar, Habana Province, who is to eliminate three persons from Camaguey. The revolutionary leader in Camaguey is Midelino ALVAREZ, who suffered imprisonment and torture during the dictatorship of MACHADO."

"Groups of revolutionaries from Habana are in all the capitals of the provinces, working with the local groups. The revolutionaries predict that there will be much bloodshed."

Field Comments

1.  "The confidential letter to the Cuban DI is considered to be an obvious attempt to put the major blame on Communist elements for recent anti-Government demonstrations as evidenced by the reference to paintings on the walls of houses such as 'Abajo Batista' and '26 de Julio' as Marxist mottoes. Recent reports also indicate that the ID is opposed to the acceptance of Communist support in its demonstrations and refused permission to Camilo Cienfuegos and other 23 members to participate in the 10 January event honoring Mella. The contents of the confidential letter are therefore evaluated as 'confidential.'"

2.  No information is available to confirm the reported presence in Cuba of Bernardo FERNANDEZ, Ortega, Fidel CASTRO or Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango.

Appraisal of Contents 3.

The following report was received from an active member of the political oppositions

As a result of differences which arose between Carlos PRIO Socarras and Ramon GRAU San Martin after PRIO succeeded GRAU as President in 1948, the PC(3) is now split into two groups, one headed by PRIO known as "Autenticos Autenticistas" and the other headed by GRAU known as "Autenticos Doctoralistas". After the break between PRIO and GRAU, GRAU endeavoured to form the "Partido de la Cubantdad" to enter the 1952 elections. However, with BATISTA's coup d'état on 10 March 1952 and PRIO's exile in the U.S., GRAU remained in Cuba speaking in the name of the Autenticos. When BATISTA announced elections for November 1954, GRAU reorganised and registered the Partido Autentico, of which he was actually no longer a member, and declared that he would oppose BATISTA as presidential candidate in the national election. GRAU's move left PRIO's group represented in Cuba by the official party cadres under the direction of Autol Catel, without legality.

PRIO, VARONA and other PRIO leaders therefore declared themselves against and his supporters and refused to support them during the elections and have since refused to recognise any of the Autenticos elected to public office in the November 1954 election.

PRIO's principal supporters are the following:

Still another group of Urtaloxe armbers of that are favorable or sympathatto to the insurrectional thesto introduced by Mdentin and his followers.

"a. Probably the most politically active and strongest segment of the Ortodoxo party is the youth branch, the Juventud Ortodoxo (JO). It has representation in just about every town in the Republic and 's particularly active at the University of Habana. Dr, Francisco, University professor and member of the Directiva Council of the Ortodoxo Party, 's adviser of the JO. CARVE is well known for his leftist leanings. Actually, when the Partido Ortodoxo was in the original stages of organisation, Communists at Habana University prepared and assisted in organising the JO. The JO frequently attacks the U.S. with slogans that dictatorships exist in Latin America because their anti-communism pleases the U.S. On 27 September, for example, Dr. Pelayo, a well-known Ortodoxo prominent in JO activities, stated on a television question-and-answer program that the dictatorship of BATISTA subsists because the Department of State 's flattered BATISTA's anti-communism, which is not anti-communist but anti-democratic. The following are some of the more prominent pro-Communists who influence the Juventud Ortodoxo:

Omar Borges, director of the Juventud Ortodoxo, wa, Secretary of the Congreso Derechos de la Juventud, organized by the Comin'sts, and has signed numerous Parxist manifests,

Máx Dunic, who was an active Comain'st propagandist in the University, has signed all Marxist manifestoes issued at the University and has been seen on different occasions with Alfredo VAPA and Raul VALDES Vivo, (well-known Commintate), close friends of his.

Salvador, Juventud director, has a Communist background and is a member of the same University group.

Mario Rivadalla, pro-Corantat, has signed manifestoes in favor of Guatemala and against the 1953 anti-Count ut legislation. He is a member of the same University group.

"d. The Movimiento de Liberación Radical is a move to form public opinion and not a political party, built around the worldwide movement of "Catholic Socia Doctrine" with branches in Cuba in the Juventude Lacion Católica, Juventud Estudantil Católico, Juventud Obrera Católica, and Juventud Universitaria Católica. These organisations are forbidden by the Church to take part in such in national politics. However, Amalio ALIO and Andrés Suálvespiid and other members of the organisations have gotten together with other intellectuals and formed the Movimiento de Liberación Radical to oppose the present regime. This movement, which is purely ideological, has no Communist influence up to the present time.

The Movimiento de la Nación, which is also not a political party but rather a movement to arouse public interest, had gained little strength to date. Its chief spokesman, José Llada, manages to keep it alive with propaganda, but there is little likelihood that it by itself will reach a position of any importance on the local political scene.

As independent movements, neither the Movimiento de Liberación Radical nor the Movimiento de la Nación has little or any change of becoming strong

1. A one page mimeographed sheet entitled "A Que Viene Mr. Nixon" was written and edited in the offices of the Federacion Estudiantil-Universitaria at the University of Habana. At least several hundred copies were run off on the mimeograph machine owned by the Faculty of Comercial Sciences and were distributed throughout the university grounds by Arando MIRANDA.
   There was no street distribution in the near vicinity of the University. This sheet was about the only real result of the full planning which took place during the week preceding the Nixon visit. These abortive plans included a street demonstration against the visit.

2. The mimeographed sheet asks the question, "Why did you come Mr. Nixon...? To build the usurpation of power by Batista?...To expend the official action of giving away our natural resources to United States monopolists?...To approve the treason of Batista against Guatemala and proclaim him one of the Caribbean dictators?..." It refers to the above, the undersigned states protest this visit which interferes in our internal affairs and which insults our dignity even more than the defiling of the statues of our heroes by the Yankee sellers and of Cuban women.

Alvaro Torba Machado Valentin Flerido Bravo
Jose Nidalgo Peraza Eduardo Esquivel Pedro Santes
R. Santiesteban Rafael Ortiz Temistocles Fuentes
Raul Soto Vivó Henry Reyes etc..

The sheet then concludes with the note: "The press, radio and television under the orders of Batista and the North American Embassy have repressed these declarations."

Field Comments:

1. The clandestine communist publication Carta Semanal of 16 February 1955 asserts 7000 copies of the sheet were distributed.

2. The clandestine communist mimeographed newsletter Prensa Continental of 15 February 1955 quotes in extenso the FBI sheet.

# Subject: Communist Influence in the FEU, University of Habana

Report No: HXH-981

Date of Information: 10-20 January 1955

Place Acquired: Habana, Cuba

Evaluation: 8-3

Date of Report: 2 February 1955

Source: Controlled American

1. Communist activities in the University, particularly in connection with Federacion Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU, Federation of University Students) affairs, have increased during the last few weeks. Almost daily informal meetings are being held by Raul VALDES Vivo, Carlos SANCHEZ, Leonar SANCHEZ, AYMATICHENA, and Late BONNE Ramirez. Usually these conversations concern election campaigns in the various student organizations, and facilities for the preparation and distribution of propaganda.

2. Indicative of FEU attitude toward the communists, students Roberto PUENTE and Federico SAINZ de la Maza commented, "the present and former regimes of the FEU have been obliged to work with the red elements since those elements were better disciplined for combat against the government".

3. On 10 January 1955 a crowd of a hundred or so students took part in a ceremony on the campus in honor of the Twenty Sixth Anniversary of the death of Communist youth leader Julio Antonio Mella. Prominent in the ceremony were: Jesus DUARTE, Andres LNU, Lecnel ALONSO, Alberto POLAND, Raul VALDES Vivo, Rene ANILLO, Jose A XECHAVARRIA, and Max Laspick.

4. At the ceremony there was distributed a 19 page pamphlet entitled, "Trinchera de Ideas", purportedly written by Julio Antonio Mella. Although mildly against the Batista government, the bulk of the articles in the pamphlet are anti-United States, and anti-capitalist, and in short typical communist propaganda.

5. Source Comment. Paragraph 2 is more true than the FEU leaders themselves would like to believe. The FEU, unflavored with the "red sauce" has long been notorious for empty, loud-mouthed sessions and propaganda. The reds simply inject a little more organization and intellectual reality and thus create more student appeal. All Latin students have a streak (large or small) of anti-U.S. sentiment, but not all will follow any empty-headed jerk who gets up to scream about "imperialists". A large percentage will respond to a subtle intellectual "realism", particularly where if pinned down for their participation they can easily squirm but with the "intellectual autonomy" explanation.

6. Mission Comment: El Mundo Editorial on 11 January 1955 contains a photograph of the ceremony mentioned in paragraph 3.

1. On 9 December 1954 the Servicio de Lateligencia Militar (SIM, Cuban Military Intelligence Service) received information that the Fartido Socialista Popular (PP, Cuban Communist Party) had plans to launch a strong anti-Government campaign based on the subject of th the proposed "Via Cuba" canal. The PSP planned tomaromain behind the scenes and to use as many cicmonts of the opposition as it could to sponsor its propagand line that the present Covernment had cold out to the United States and that the proposed canal was merely an extension of the Panama Canal. Groups from the Ortodoxo Party (Firtido del pueblo Cubano (Ortodoxe)), by ΜαλλIK, reportedly collaborated with the PSP in the planning of tho protest crmpalm against the canal. Cuban intellectuals and professional me sympathetic to Communism or connected in one way or another with the PSP, were to bỏ thổ ôngs who would launch the campaign, stressing the selling-out-of-sovereignty theme and the need for a milar referendum before any Cuben goverment made any treaty or agreement affecting the territorial integrity of the nation.

2. On 14 December 1954 the Cuban press published an article concerning a call mado by Max LESMIK in the name of the national executive committee of the Ortodoxo Youth, to all youta organizations, including the Juventud Socialista (JS, Cuban Coinist with organization) and other organized centers of public opinion to attend a-resting at radio station CO.C.O. on 16 December 1954 in order to jo in the protest against the Goverment's plan to build the "Via Cuba canal. On 16 Dece-bar 1954, at nine o'clock in the evening, approximately 85 persons met at radio station 0.0.0.0. in answer to LESNIK's call or in accordance with Join miting structions from the PSP About 75 of these porcons were Communists, reprosci "barrion (ward) committees of the Pip or the JS in Habene er Communist labor Syndicates, and the remainder, were Ortodoxo members, many of when had had close ties with the communists in the past.

3.  The evening's program included speeches by four persons, representing the Ortodoxo party and Cuban youth, who attacked the economic, labor, and social policies of the Government, the absorption of Cuban soil by "Yankee imperialists," the interference of the United States Government in the affairs of the Latin American nations and its support of those which were dictatorships, as well as the proposed plan of the Cuban government to build a canal which would involve the ceding of core Cuban territory to foreign interests (i.e., the United States).
    The meeting closed with the creation of committees charged with fomenting public protest throughout Cuba against the present regime and against "Yankee imperialism."

4.  In addition to the role it played in organising the meeting at radio station C.O.C.O. on 16 December 1954, the PSP has also succeeded in arousing popular contingent against the proposed canal among the university students, members of labor unions, and members of educational, cultural, and civic institutions. It has been stressing in its propaganda that the canal will constitute a principal military threat and place the country in the danger zone of atomic-nuclear bomb warfare. The PSP leaders consider this anti-canal movement as a rallying point for all anti-Batista elements which can possibly be converted into the long-sought "National Democratic Front." Jose Pardo Lliada who championed the "Voto Negativo" (vote against BATISTA) prior to the general elections of 1958 has also seized on the matter of the proposed canal to attack the present government by calling for a "total union of the masses in defense of the national integrity and the complete liquidation of the present regime" during his television program on 17 December 1954. Another vehicle being used by the PSP to spread its anti-canal propaganda is the Asociación Latino-America Libre, a cultural organization reported to be a Communist front, whose board of officers includes a Communist leader and a Communist youth leader of national standing, Jare PAYAL and Gregorio M. ORTEGA Suarez, respectively.

Field Comments:

1.  *Carta Semanal* (clandestine Communist publication), No. 69, dated 8 December 1954, contained an article which denounced, in very strong language, the plan to build the "Via Cuba Canal." Approximately a week later the overt Cuban press took up this subject, presenting the pros as well as the cons, and was still carrying articles on it as late as 26 December 1954.

2.  President-elect Fulgencio BATISTA and the present chief of the Cuban Navy, Contralmirante Jose FUENTES Rodriguez Calderon, have issued public statements defending the plan to build the canal and blaming the Communists for launching "an insidious campaign against a project as nationalist as the 'Canal Via Cuba' would be" and censuring the opposition elements who have taken advantage of that campaign to attack the present government. Despite these statements and others by other government officials, the defense of the proposed project has been too weak, both technically and politically, that public sentiment against the project has apparently increased considerably since mid-December 1954.

1. AMPUTEE advised GROWERY on 7 March 1954 that he had been instructed by his chief to prepare a *paquete* (frans-pp) of subject, and as directed, he had prepared a false report emphasizing subject's communist connections and activities. He made available the original draft of h's memorandum which is identical to a memorandum received by Ambassador GARDNER from the head of the Cuban Army on 8 March. Also included with the memorandum to the Ambassador was a copy of a letter allegedly sent from Paris by subject to Fidel CASTRO, leader of the attempted uprising in Santiago de Cuba in July 1953, and presently serving a sentence at the Isle of Pines penitentiary.

2. It is not known at this time whether the letter included with the memorandum sent to Ambassador GARDNER is a copy of a legitimate piece of correspondence, or whether this also has been fabricated by the SIX to give added strength to their character assassination effort. We will endeavor to clarify this point at a future meeting with AMPUTEE. Copies of the letter to CASTRO are forwarded herewith to. Headquarters and Paris.

Subject: Dr. Ramiro ARANGO Alsina Report No: HCL-737

Place Acquired: Habana, Cuba Date of Information: 1950-date

Evaluation: As indicated Date Acquired: 8 March 1954

Source: Controlled American Date of Report: 9 March 1954

1. The Cuban Government, to further discredit subject, has prepared a memorandum containing a series of false charges concerning his communist connections and activities. The memorandum was prepared by the Cuban Servicio de Inteligencia Militar for forwarding to the United States Government with the intention that action would then be taken by the United States to remove subject's wife from her present employment with the United States Army in Paris.

2. There follows an English translation of the points covered by the SIM in the memorandum of false accusations:

Dr. Ramiro ARANGO Alsina, an attorney, is a relative of ex-President Ramón GRAU San Martin. During GRAU's regime, ARANGO was appointed Counsellor of the Cuban Embassy in Oslo, Norway, but was relieved of this post after he was detained by the Norwegian authorities for possession of a shipment of contraband nylon hose. Upon his return to Cuba, he was detained by the Bureau of Investigations when a sample case of precious stones was found among his personal effects.

ARANGO is an affiliate of the Partido del Pueblo Cubano (Ortodoxo), and a member of the Committee of Attorneys for that party.

ARANGO is a member of the revolutionary group which includes (fnu) Palayo, (fnu) PALACIO, M. LEDNICK, Francisco CARCER, Eluy ROCA, and Anibal ESCALANTE and was under indictment for participation in the attack at Cuartel Moncada, Santiago de Cuba, in the summer of 1953. He is a close friend of Fidel CASTRO (long-time militant of the Juventud Socialista) and his brother, Raúl CASTRO, also a communist, both of whom are presently in prison for participation in the communist-sponsored Santiago uprising. ARANGO attended the meeting of Cuban oppositionists in Montreal in July 1953, and along with Isidro MORELL Banterpo, a Corrientist, and José Pardo Llada, who was a writer of the communist party in the barrio of Puilivar

ARANGO represented the Frente Unico de los Partidos Comunista-Ortodoxo-Prifista. ARANGO is reported to have represented the communist interests, although he was charged with defense of the Ortodoxo policy, and was known to have been in contact with communist leaders. He has been cited on several occasions as a "communist de fachada file", and as such has permitted the Cuban communist party to infiltrate various elements which were formerly

hortile to the communists. ARAUCO is believed to belong to the secret cadres of the Partido Socialista Popular, although his activities have been carried on behind an Ortodoxe front, such as in the case of Max LESNICE, Vicentina ARTURA, et al.

At present, ARANCO and his wife are in Paris having left Cuba on 10 December 1953 in the company of Lines Perez, who had sought asylum in the Haitian Embassy in Habana and both individuals are reported to be in contact with the revolutionary Ortodoxo-Communist Prifsta elements, through a clandestine world-wide communist communications system. The wife of ARAUCO, who is reported to, be a member of the Swedish royal family, is presently employed in the offices of the United States Army in Paris.

Files of this office indicate the following concerning subject, in addition to the information set out in our memorandum of 19 May 1953.

A Legal Attaché report of 3 April 1947 states that Ramiro ARAUCO Alsina was appointed Chancellor of the Cuban Leation in Moscow at the age of 27, on the recommendation of Juan JUARDILLO, President of the Partido Socialista Popular (Dr) Rafael P GONZALEZ Munos, and Dr Oscar CALA. He was not known to have engaged in communist activities, but was reported as "inclined toward socialist theories". At the time of this appointment, ARAUCO had no diplomatic experience.

In August 1952 subject was arrested by the SIM for activities against the regime.

On 16 September 1953, subject was arrested for activities against the government, and taken to la Colada. At this time a considerable number of known oppositionists were arrested, including the PRP leaders Lasaro Pena and Joaquin Ordoqui.

SPECIFICS Report of Revolutionary Preparations in Central
America Against Cuban Government

REF: HKH-W-525

1. No additional information concerning alleged plans of the Caribbean Legion to attack the Batista government has been received by the Mission. The latest available information regarding revolutionary activities against that government is contained in HKH-678.

2. Reports received in the past concerning the Caribbean Legion s attempts to enlist BATISTA s support for Legion revolutionary activities have been given a low evaluation (as to content), as indicated in the pertinent portions of HKH-467 and HKH-397. To date the Mission has received no information which would warrant changing such an evaluation.

3. Indications here are that the Batista regime is too preoccupied with a possible revolt attempt originating within the country to permit planning for any offensive action against any other country in the Caribbean. Recent friendly overtures by BATISTA, in the form of decorations bestowed on Hector TRUJILLO of the Dominican Republic and PERE: Jimenes of Venezuela, also serve to indicate that the present Cuban government is not contemplating any action against those countries.

4. As to a possible attack on the Batista regime from outside Cuba, the Cuban Armed Forces and security agencies have long been alerted to a possible air attack on key installations in Habana as well as multiple assults from the sea. Mexico, Costa Rica, and Guatemala have been mentioned as possible take-off points for the planes to be used in the air attack.

DISPATCH NO. PLA-278

TO: Chief, KO

DATE: 21 January 1954

FROM: Acting Chief of Station, Lima, Peru

SUBJECT: GENERAL

SPECIFIC: Douglas Hedden ALLEN

Action required by Headquarters: For information and such action as is deemed necessary.

1. Douglas Hedden ALLEN is President of the Astoria Importing & Manufacturing Company, Inc. in Iquitos, Peru, and a director of the Cerro de Pasco Corporation. He is personally acquainted with Ambassador Harold H. TITTMANN.

2. On 18 September 1953, Subject called at this Station to see Anthrop T. HECMAN, who was out of Lima at that time. He talked with Jane C. BURBEAT and at her suggestion that he talk with the Chief of the Political Section stated that he wanted to talk only with HECMAN, that he had confidential information on Rafael PAVLETICH Trujillo, Prefect of Iquitos (and brother of former Communist functionary EstebanyFALETICH Trujillo) and some Communist literature which had come into his possession. Subject returned to the United States on 2 October 1953 without trying to contact HECMAN again.

3. Former agent DUFTERDAR, who has made a nuisance of himself by calling sporadically at this Station, told HECMAN on 1 October 1953 that he was planning to apply for an immigration visa to the United States and that Subject had tried to contact HECMAN on DUFTERDAR's behalf in connection with the anticipated application. DUFTERDAR further claimed that Subject has a close friend who is a senior official of ODESSA from whom he had gotten DUFTERDAR's name, and that Subject had shown DUFTERDAR a picture of a Peruvian Communist which DUFTERDAR remembered having submitted to this Station five or six years ago. It seems quite likely that DUFTERDAR gave Subject HECMAN's name.

4. In connection with another matter (LIMA-0340), HECMAN contacted the subject of EPIN-949, who, in the course of conversation, told of having received a letter (encl. 1.) through.

Mr. New York office from Subject. This letter forwarded a report (believed to be encl. 2.) to Ernesto NICOLINI. Subject of HPLA-949 also told of having cocktails on several occasions in New York City several months ago with Subject and Ambassador TITTMAN. During one of these get-togethers Subject stated that a report (believed to be encl. 2) had been made available to KUARK.

5. On 18 January 1954 DUFTERDAR volunteered a copy of enclosure 2 with the explanation that NICOLINI had sent it by him especially for HEGMAN but that NICOLINI wanted it back. When questioned as to the source of the document DUFTERDAR said that he did not know. the identity of the source but that it had come from an English aviator. The document provided by DUFTERDAR has not been shown to Subject of HPLM-929.

EPLA-28 and references, and LIKA-0240 suggest that Augusto ROMERO Lovo, Minister of Government and Police; Mariano TUR Aljoven, a confidential investigator on President ODria's staff; Ernesto NICOLINI, a prominent and wealthy Peruvian businessman; DUFTERDAR, employee of Ernesto NICOLINI; and Luis QUEIROLO Nicolini, nephew and employee of Ernesto NICOLINI, are associated in some sort of intelligence work, which is separate from the intelligence activities of Alejandro SPARZA Zanartu, Director of Government and Municipalities, who is immediately inferior to ROMERO Lovo in the Ministry of Government. On the basis of the foregoing data and references, it appears that Subject is involved with intelligence operatives of the Peruvian Government on one hand, and is in contact with KUARK and other U.S. Government officials on the other hand.

Early in April of 1952, about a month after the Coup de Etat of General Fulgencio Batista, the deposed president, Dr. Carlo Prio Socarras entrusted to his ex-minister of Education and State, Dr. Aureliano Sanches Arango with the responsibility of organising a vast subversive movement, created to depose in turn Batista, and return to power the Cuban Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Cubano) if this were at all possible. The first stage taken by Dr. Sanches Arango were to give a political form to the movement, and to create favorable conditions for an uprising (putsch) at the precisely opportune moment, to be called "the zero hour." Immediately after Batista took over, the P.C found itself destitute of any kind of influence, since all former officials were dismissed by Batista. Hence Dr. Sanches Arango began to reconstruct the P.C, placing in the positions of comand some of the most sincere members of the party, most of whom had formerly been in secondary status in party affairs, and in Government affairs.

While Dr. Antonio de Varona was again made President, men such as Fr. Arrocolio Acui, Dr. Armando Hernander and a few others, became the most prominent figures of the Party. Immediately, the P.C began a campaign of passive legal opposition to the administration of the Batista Government, whose every step received the condemnation and adverse criticies of the Propaganda Committee of the Party. In addition, three tires a week in the newspaper, Free Press (Prensa Libre), articles by Dr. Arrocolio Acui and Dr. Fondiallo pictured the present Government as a "do nothing" one, with policies, of lack of policies, contrary to the public interest. At the same time the articles were designed to restore to the party the faith which formerly it had enjoyed from the Cuban masses.

In the meantime, Dr. Sanches Arango initiated the opposition by force in the Central American countries. Almost immediately he found out that the re-constructed FC was gaining no ground with the people and that he would have to create a new political formula to draw to the side of the opposition of insurrection, the general populace, by now disgusted not only with the Batista Government, but with the F.C as well. It was proposed that Dr. Roberto Agramonte, head of the Peoples Party (Partido del Pueblo Cubano), have an interview with Dr. Prio in Miami, but the former declined on the ground that his party wanted to remain neutral in the whole affair. However, Emilio M. Ochoa opposed openly the ideas of his chief (Dr. Agramonte) advocating an alliance of the two parties to make the opposition more effective. To this end he went to Guatemala to see Dr. Sanches Arango. While there, conferences were held in the home of Dr. Thul Caoguode, then Ambassador of Guatemala in Cuba, and nor Foreign Minister of the Government of Colonel Arbens. There warlike aspects of the movement wore discussed, also the merging of the two parties. On the return of Sr. Ochoa to Cuba, eventually the amalgamation was effected with equal administration on the part of both of the parties. This end was hastened by a surreptitious visit of Dr. Arango (Sanches) to his native soil (he was then a political refuge in Guatemala).

From the moment Batista took over the power in Cuba, Guatemala placed itself unconditionally on the side of Dr. Prio and served as a base for the military preparation of the conspiracy. Immediately the Caribbean League (legion) at the time reduced to impotency, began to function again, to take a preponderant

part in latin American relations. In the latter part of 1952, the military
plan was drawn up by Sanches Arango with the aid of Foreign Minister Raul
Ceeguida and often in the conferences the presidential candidate (Costa Rica)
Jose Figueres took an active part, promising the support of Costa Rica should
be elected president. Dr. Juan Jose Arevalo participated as well, to the
extent of using his influence with the Guatemalan Grey officials that they
might join the movement later. On the Caribbean coast of Guatemala is a place
called Livingston. To the West, there is a road which leads to a little native
village (indigera), name for the moment forgotten by this agent. To the south-
west of this place, there is a very bad road which ends in a little valley at
the end of which there is a series of low hills. Back of those hills is sit-
uated a camp of the Caribbean Legion. Here is established the General Head-
quarters of Aureliano Sanches Arango. There exists here a force of 4,000 men
regularly trained, quartered and fed. Their practice is held daily under the
direction of General Abelardo Cuadra, veteran of the Spanish Civil War and one
of the organizers of the movement of Cayo Confitres.

The force situated here is divided into two battalions, one named Battalion
f4, PABLO ES LA FUENTE BRAU, the other Battalion,5, IGOTO AGUIRRE.
The force is divided into small groups and taught to use machine guns (tripod
type), also hand-type Garand Rifles, automatic repeating rifles 1-1. Nearly
all the officers are veterans of the Spanish Civil War. In addition to the
military practice, the officers get together once a week for conferences over
historical and political matters as expounded by Juan Jose Arevalo, Romulo
Betancourt, Aureliano Sanches Arango, etc.

Near Livingston there is a little gulf on which is situated Puerto Barrios.
South of this port, there is a tiny port not marked on the map, named Montagua.
In this place with landing craft, practice is held with the idea of disembark-
ing in Cuba. From Montagua, several shipments of arms have been made to Cuba.
The other large concentration of men and arms is in Costa Rica.

Northwest of Puerto Limon on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, there is
a place known as la Virgen. Back of this reached by a small country road, back
of some low hills, is found the camp. Here are 2,000 men or more divided into
three battalions, f1 Augusto Cesar Sandino, f2 Horasan, f3 Antonio Mateo. A
little north of this camp, there is a kind of landing field which contains four
(English) Lancaster Bombers, acquired from Canada by Ingeniero Carlos Hevia in
Canada. The men in this camp carry English Repeating rifles, but they also
have Thompson machine guns and Mendoza machine guns with plenty of ammunition.
The men in Guatemala also have this additional arm.

The plan is that on landing in Cuba of the "patriots" those arms will be
given to all the civilians who are sympathetic with the cause. Cubans generally
are more familiar with this type of arm than the English repeating rifle, who
use is not easy to learn in a few minutes. The crews of the planes are English.
The leader of the outfit is a Canadian named Chisholm who was a Captain FAF
during the war, flying Lancaster Bombers. He is a personal friend of Carlos
Prio Socarras. This camp did not amount to much when Tillo Ulate was President
of Costa Rica, but the minute Figueres came to power, the arms and men began to

flow in, in quantity, from Guatemala, which has been the great center for the accumulation of arms. From a place in British Honduras named Middlesex, many rifles were secured with the connivance of British officers stationed there, then passed across the border.

The plan of invasion is as follows: When the zero hour comes, planes from Costa Rica and Guatemala will arrive at Habana prepared to drop bombs over the most important military posts in Cuba. As stated before, the crews of these planes are "English mercenaries" who, for money have agreed to take part in this adventure, regardless of their politics. Coincidentally, the men from the camps in Central America will be landed in various parts of the Island. At the same time there will appear in the streets members of both parties, well-armed, to battle the local police, capture them, take over the civilian authority. While all this fighting is going on, leaders of the political parties under the direction of Eufemio Fernandez and Jesus Gonzalez Cartas will capture the personages most prominent of the actual administration, who, once the revolution is successful, will be put in jail under the charge of murder. With this action, it is expected that most of the citizens will come over to the side of the conspirators. Judging from things heard by this agent in an interview held in a Mexico Hotel between Juan Jose Arevalo and Ex-Colonel Elons, the battle is set to take place before the general sale of the next sugar crop, about January of next year. While not within the province of this agent, he has learned that General Foron is favorable to the conspiracy, sending arms of Argentine manufacture, to the Central American camps.

On various occasions, cargoes of arms of different makes and kinds have been introduced into the island, a procedure now made very difficult because of the vigilance of the Cuban airforce, who constantly patrol the space between Cuba and Central America. This agent knows about the following concentrations in the hands of "Cuban orthodox youth," headed by Jose Iglesias, [illegible] and Bernardo Blanca Goudin; there are more than 600 machine guns [illegible], 10,000 grenades (hand type) all of Mexican manufacture. The arms are hidden in the "finca" of the son of Jose Manuel Cortina, in Pino del Rio. In the hands of Pedro Duran, head of the youth movement in Iriamno, are about 100 machine guns, 50 grenades and 10 or 12 rifles M-1. The arms are hidden in a house situated near the "Central Toledo" property of the secretary general of the workers of that central.

## Comments

The fact that the Communist Party of Cuba would take the measures described in the attached report is not considered surprising. It can be seen from a study of Embassy dispatches and from our past reports on this subject, the PSP is finding itself in an increasingly worse position, politically, financially, and psychologically. The greatest strength of the PSP comes from ignorant laborers who are, by US standards, at least, exploited.

It is only logical, therefore, that communist strength remains, at present, in the field where Marxist ideology has always been used to the best advantage; that of the ignorant workers. It is probable that the PSP, as a political party, will no longer carry the weight and respect it has in the past, at least until economic conditions in Cuba grow much worse, or until the present East-West tension diminishes considerably. Until recently, two possible solutions to the POP's present predicament lay in its uniting with the Ortodoxo Party or with the PAU. Concerning the Ortodoxo Party it is known that the leftist groups within that party (Vicentina, FLADA, RAKICHIK and others) are militating for a phone with the communists (See copy of memorandum from E. T. CRAIN to the Ambassador, dated January 28, 1952, copy of which is attached), but, so far, have been checked by the anti-communist elements within the Ortodoxo Party. Until recently, conservative anti-BATISTA elements in Cuba stated with conviction that BATISTA would join with the communists in a selfish attempt to gain the Presidency. However, BATISTA, in two articles appearing in (December 2 and 13, 1951, closed the door on rumors of this kind by stating that only way the POP and the PLU could unite would be if the PSP would publicly state that, in case of an international conflict, the FSP would aide with the United Nations, and against Russia. An interesting sequel to this statement, and possibly connected with it, was a leaflet distributed in the streets of Habana in early January entitled, "To the Workers of the PAU and to the People of Cuba", signed by Cbdullo AMEZ VELIZ (Payari), leader of Hloqua Obrero del PAU, which is known for its leftist and pro-communist sympathies. In the leaflet, AMEZ VELIZ claimed that BATISTA had tried to destroy him and expell him from the Bloque Chrero, purportedly, because NUNEZ had tried to defend the interest of the working classes end of the Bloque Chrero within the FAV, a real and decided opposition line to the government, and is determined that a united oppositionist front be formed to defend.

the government in the next elections". The pamphlet went on to say that "the action of BATISTA is a direct aid to the very government we are fighting, a government which uses the fascist system to destroy the leaders of the workers by putting gangsters and thieves at the hand of the syndicates, attacking the union halls and serving the ends of the exploiting, vagranton and oppressing and pursuing the true workers".

It is felt that the value of the attached information is primarily to point out a possible new force in the Cuban political scene, composed of labor groups, within the PAU and the Ortodoxo Party, who are dissatisfied with their own rational party leadership and who can and probably will join with similar groups in the PSP in an attempt to get power for themselves.

1. The two main centers of communist penetration and sympathy in the Cuban syndical movement are found in the *Bloque Obrero del Partido Accion Unitaria* and in the *Confederacion Obrera Ortodoxa of the Partido del Pueblo Cubano (Ortodoxo)*. These groups have shown dislike for anti-communist labor leaders who have tried to join them despite the fact that these labor leaders are well-known for their honesty, ability and good intentions in furthering the labor movement in Cuba. In the past few months, and more particularly within the past few weeks, the collaboration between those groups and the *Partido Socialista Popular* syndical elements has become so close that it has alarmed the anti-communist *Confederacion de Trabajadores de Cuba*.

COMMENT: As has been previously reported, the present political, as well as financial condition of the Cuban Communist Party is extremely serious. It would appear that the stigma of a past with the communists is sure political death for other political parties in the coming elections of June 1952. This has forced the PSP into an isolated position from which there does not appear to be any escape through aligning itself with another political party.

2. The communists have been and are now carrying on a campaign in these syndicates to penetrate and undermine the anti-government labor factions in an effort to gain control of those groups at a later date. This campaign was waged in three stages.

a. The first stage was the communists' penetration of the anti-communist syndicates, paying up their union dues and using their voice and vote in the union meetings to propose and elect their candidates for committee positions.

b. The second stage was to sow seeds of doubt among the members of those groups in joining with any of the anti-communist labor federations or with the government CTO by accusing the CTO leaders of having sold themselves out to the employers and to the government which are depicted as the enemies of the laboring class.

c. The communists have always tried to exploit the anti-government feeling in these labor groups particularly within the *Bloque Obrero del PAU* in an effort to destroy the anti-communist labor leaders in the various syndicates.

SOURCE COMMENT: Tho owners of the Crusellas plant are in the process of reducing the labor force by 50-60% and hope to maintain the same production rate as before. The dismissed workers will be transferred to a new plant in the process of construction where the detergent, "FAB", is to be manufactured. The workers are discouraged because they claim that the work performed in the Crusellas plant requires all of the present labor force and the company should hire additional men to work in the FAB plant. The attempt of the Crusellas owners to reduce the labor force in this manner is against standing labor laws of the country, but the Crusellas syndicate led by the Ortodox labor leaders who are being advised by their communist friends, is taking advantage of the present situation in furthering their own interests.

MEMORANDUM

January 28, 1952

To: The Ambassador

From: E.T. Crain

Subject: Dr. Portell Vila warns Embassy that Ortodoro left-wingers are trying to bring Communists into the party.

Dr. Portell Vila called today at the Embassy and, during the course of the conversation spoke of his grave preoccupation regarding the efforts of Ortodoro left-wingers to bring Communists into the party.

He stated that Pardo Llada, Eduardo Corona, Vicentina Antuna, Max Lesnik and others were trying to get communists into the Ortodoro party. He said that, specifically, they were trying to get the notorious Communist, Salvador Garcia Aguero, not only into the Ortodoro party but to run as an Ortodoro candidate for senator. He said that a group of Ortodoro approached him on the matter to learn his views and he told then he would resist such a move with all his strength.

Portell Vila said he considered the matter so urgent that he at once wrote an article entitled "Timbre-Ministerial" which he was going to try to get into *El Mundo* of January 29 instead of Wednesday the 30th which is the day of the week when his column usually appears. He said this would be an extension of his article published January 20 in *El Mundo*.

I told Portell Vila that while the Embassy maintained a strict neutral attitude in the matter of Cuban politics, it would have a very deep interest in anything pertaining to the Communists when we considered an enemy common to all free countries and free national political parties. I congratulated him on his efforts to keep Communists out of his own Ortodoro party and wished him every success in this undertaking. I said I assumed that if the party announced notorious Communists as Ortodoro candidates for office that the party would presumably lose a lot of support from persons who did not wish to be associated with Communists. I added that I hoped my assumption was not mere wishful thinking. He stated that it was definitely not wishful thinking. He stated that it was definitely not wishful thinking and that is exactly what would happen. He said that he would nevertheless oppose the efforts of Pardo Llada and company with all the strength at his command, regardless of whether an association with Communists won or lost votes for the Ortodoxo party.

1. The PSP (Partido Socialista Popular Cuban Comunist Party) high command maintains continued interest to a very large degree in the Juventud Socialista organization. One of the principal tasks of the communist party is to maintain the direction of a strong communist youth movement which will respond only to the ideological foundation of the communist party. In the PSP: the most insistent voice of this communist principle is that of BLAS ROCK who takes a personal interest in the direction of the Juventud Socialista and constantly watches over its activities through trusted lieutenants. Many of the present leaders of the PSP were formerly leaders of the Juventud Comu- nista, the former Juventud Socialista. Men of this type are Severo AGUERE, Agger SUAREZ, and Osvaldo SANCHEZ, prominent PSP member in Camagüey Province. On its own part, the Juventud Socialista maintains a close liaison with the National Executive Committee of the PSP through its leader, Flavio BRAVO, who attends the weekly meetings of the National Committee.

2. The caliber of the Juventud Socialista direction is high. Its leaders are militant communists and many members of the Juventud Socialista National, and Provincial Committees have been political candidates for various government offices in past elections. Second to Flavió BRAVO in the leadership of the group is Luis ARTIN; both of these men were political candidates in recent elections and have attended various con- ferences abroad. Other leaders of note are: Lionel Soro, President of the School of Philosophy, Habana University; Bienvenigo and his wife, Yolanda LOPEZ PEREZ; Federico Rita and Georgina VILAR, all cildren of the well-known communist leader César VILAR, who were educated in Russia; Julio ACHADO; Bientenido Suarez, RedALDES VIVO; Ramón CALCINES, Juventud Socialista member from Las Villas Province; Fidel DOMENECH of Oriente Province; and PAEZ (fnu) of the printing section of the Juventud Socialista. Other youth leaders not members of the Juventud Socialista but closely tied up with their activities are: Alfredo GUEVARA; Enrique OVARES; Aramis ABOADA, ax SHICK of the Ortodoxo Perty, and Humberto L. ACADO, Pesicen of the Juventud of the PAU (Partido Acción Unitaria and Director of the newspaper, Vancuanila Unitaria.

3. The structure of the Juventud Socialista is like that of the PSP. It has committees in all the districts (barrios) of the City of Habana and in the larger cities of the interior. Up until now the Juventud Socialista has not had, according to source, clandestine leaders to take the place of the present overt leaders in case the party is outlawed, nor does it now have these clandestine leasers. However, source feels that there are many secondary and less well-krom leaders within the Juventud. Socialista who would be able to assure the direction of of a clandestine communist puth organization if the PSP decided such an organizatio should be set up. Source supplies the following cares ares a a possibie clandestine lenders of such an organization, Juli ACHADO, responsasie juvenile (youth representative) of the C (Confederació de Trabajadores de Cuba) (Communis )(Communist) a few years agoj Bienvenido SUAREZ, is the responsable Juvenil" of the CTC (Corrawist) at presentr Federico, Rita, and Georgina VILAR; Walterio CARBOIELL, lav school student, Hasana University; and Hector/CARBOL, communist youth leader at the Ariguanabo textile plant, in Eauta, Habana Province.

4. The PRIO Administrative's anti-communist attitude over the past six ronthains not visibly affected unfavorably the unity of the Juventuä Socialista, according to source. Source gives as a reason for this the fact that the ranks of the Juventud Socialista are composed of proven con:unist militant youths. Source claims he nous of only one case of defection from the Juventud Socialista ranks, that of a youth named ElioXCAPESTANY, Juventud Socialista leader in the Escuela de Artes y Oficios, who has joined the Juventud del PAU.

Comment: As is well known, in other communist parties under similar circumstances and as we have previously re- ported, sone communists have been instructed to in filtrate other political parties. It is difficult to understand how source can conclude positively that the CAPESTALY case was one of defection from the Juventud Socialista.

5. It is true, however, that the PSP has examined very carefully- the ranks of the Juventud Socialista Dor signs of bourgeois weakness. The barrio committees of the PSP established simi lar committees of the Juventud Socialista with the purpose

in mind of gaining new members for the party as a whole. The methods by which they tried to attract new members for the.... Juventud Socialista were made up of sewing clubs for girls, English classes, parlor cames, and, from time to time, dances. This method had good results és far as getting the youth to draw closer to the Juventud Gocialista; however, racial feel-ing zilitated against the complete success of this method for anywhite girls found that they were expected to nix and dance with negroes, which was against their personalcon-victions. As a result of this racial prejudice, the majority of netro girls among the Juventud Socialista ranks is noticeable. The PSP has now managed to purify the ranks of the Juventud..... Socialista in preparation for a harder life ahead. The former sewing cireles, paflor ganes, and dances have disappeared and in their lace entertaiment less conducive to stirring up racial prejudice, such as excursions into the country, etc., are taking place. Today, the Juventud Socialista rants can hore or less be colunted nted upon to act inca united fashion for the good be PSP and to follow the orders of their leaders.

6. Although there are no official figures on the membership of the Juventud Socialista, source: uses as a yardstick the fact that on one occasion Flavio BRAVO stated that there were more thân 15,000 socialist youths in the nation and that of these more than 10,000 were in the City of Cabana. Sourae believes that there is probably an overlar betieen a member of the Juventud Socialista who is of voting age and also affiliates with the PSP Gering elections. Talking into account this duplication of membership, source believes that the 15,000 figure is correct,

7. The present activities of the Juventud Socialista are listed as, follows:

A. The cost important job of the Juventud Socialista is its support of the peace partisans rovement. Tais consists of street demonstrations, making signs for various parades, collecting signatures, etc.

B. The Juventui Socialista constant tries to maintain good relations with other politel youth organizations, such as the Juventud del PAU, of the Ortodoxos, and of the Autén-ticas libres. The Juventud Socialista also tries to influence

and keep friends with the FEC (Federación Estudiantil Uni-versitaria) of Habana University, the Casonic youth inom the AJP, are various schools, and universities throughout the island.

They carried out certain demonstrations or propaganda in support of the communist "Plan Cubano contra la Crisis" and the "Conferencia en Defensa de la cononia Nacional,"

8. In a national committee meeting of the PSP in June 1950 the directors of the party recommended that the Juventud Socialista spend its energy on the following assignments:

A. To work through peasant associations or organize such associations where they did not exist in an effort to gét such groups to support the partisans of peace movement.

does not supply any indication that BRAVO carries on clandestine liaison with or penetration activities into other youth groups.

11. The Comisión Juvenil of the CIC (Communist) is the same type of organization as the Juventud Socialista but with a different name. The only difference between these two is that the Juventud Socialista is a well-organized unit with a definite membership, whereas the Comisión Juvenil is under the direction of the Org (Communist) and its membership is mainly made up of Juventud Socialista members with non-communist youths forming the balance. The head of the Comisión Juvenil of the CTC (Communist) is Bienvenido SUAREZ, negro, with his deputies, Hector CARBONELL and Julio MACHADO, also negroes. The official statements and acts of these men are guided and directed by Carlos FERNANDEZ R., one of the communist leaders of the CTC. The activities of the Comisión Juvenil are limited mainly to parades and demonstrations of the CTC itself and they do not have an organized existence in the same manner as the Juventud Socialista. Membership of the Comisión Juvenil is on a much more reduced scale than that of the Juventud Socialista.

TO Chief, WH Division

FROM Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT Technical Surveillance Soviet/Satellite Agents

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES HMMW-10893

1.  Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City. The Station in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail- able for assignment to these targets. As lieadquarters is aware, this Station can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high enough priority to cover.

2.  For example, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957, 1960 and 1961; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue the coverage.

3.  Presently, Elena VASQUEZ Gomez, one of the persons referred to in reference, works for General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio, pro- Communist former President of Mexico. Coverage of CARDENAS by LIENVOY means a certain amount of coverage of VASUEZ Gomes.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director, Plans

SUBJECT: Project LIFEAT (Renewal)

WH - Mexico City

:3592

1. The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented for renewal for the period 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963. The project supports a unilateral telephone tap operation which provides daily information on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico City and personnel thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and groups.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $300,000 from the DD/P-WH Division budget in fiscal year 1963, subject to the availability of funds. Of this amount $118,800 is estimated for administrative salaries; $43,411 for field agent salaries; $20,928 for basehouse rentals; $35,000 for equipment; $2,100 for local transportation; and $19,761 for miscellaneous operational expenses.

3. The Field Project Outline and review which are forwarded by the Division with a covering memorandum, give a clear description of the project activity and accomplishments. The project has been in continuous operation since 1961, starting with a single tap against the Soviet station in Mexico City and now covering as many as thirty lines in a given month. The project is staffed by an "outside" case officer (Career Agent David M. WILSTAD (p) of Project LPIICG), four contract agents who do administrative work, and twenty-one field agents including monitors and linesmen. During the past year the project provided coverage of the home phones of three Soviet Intelligence officers, the Polish Embassy, the Yugoslav Embassy, major firms dealing in the transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba, American Communists in Mexico, and exile and revolutionary groups in Mexico. CI information was obtained and additional security was provided Station operations. Although coverage of the official Soviet and Czech installations remains a joint operation with the Mexican Government in LIEMVOY, Project LIFEAT remains available to resume coverage of these installations should a change in the local government or its attitude to CIA participation necessitate such change.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 4

For the future, the Station has hopes of employing LIFEAT assets in "hot mike" operations which will require access to telephone centrals and cables. It is the opinion of the Station that the support provided the Station operations, the CI/CE Information, and the ability to cover sensitive targets without revealing our interest to liaison services justifies the expenditure of funds, time, and personnel under this project. The overall performance of all agents in the complex continued to be good; no security problems were encountered which were not solved by the personnel involved.

4. Appropriate Special Staff components recommend renewal. The FI Staff notes that the project continues to be a most useful operational asset of the Station and in addition has produced thirty-seven positive intelligence disseminations, six of which were of particular interest concerning the illegal transhipment of goods to Cuba. FI/D comments that one item of direct interest to FI/D was received from Project LIFEAT and that the technical coverage of the diplomatic installations would afford valuable assistance to the planning and conduct of any FI/D endeavor to mount operations. The CI Staff reiterates that the facilities of this project sustained and used for the coverage of known or highly suspected agents of the Soviet/satellite/Cuban intelligence services in Mexico. CI notes that some twenty of these agents have been documented in detailed target studies which were forwarded to the Station.

5. I recommend renewal of Project LIFEAT and invite the Division's attention to the recommendations of CI Staff in paragraph 4 above.

SUBJECT: Project LIFEAT Renewal

FI Staff recommenda reneval of Project LIFEAT. This unilateral audio effort continues to be a most useful operational asset of the station as indicated by the specific examples furnished in the renewal request. In addition, it produced 37 positive intelligence disseminations, six of which were of particular interest concerning illegal transhirment of 1.8. goods to Cuba.

Project LIFEAT WH/Mexico
(Audio Operation)

1.  FI/INT files contain 37 positive information disseminations attributed wholly or in part to Project LIFEAT during the year 1 July 1961 through June 1962. They were concerned principally with contacts between Mexican Communists or leftists and Cubans or individuals of the Soviet Bloc, and with the travel of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of particular interest consisted of information on Transcontinental S.A., a company allegedly engaged in the illegal transshipment of US goods to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Barmeja, now living in Mexico. There was reporting on Nicaraguan and Spanish exile activity in Mexico and on the revolutionary sentiment and expectations of other Latin American nationals.

2.  LIFEAT has provided positive intelligence of value and of relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO. It has been pointed out in the renewal request that the production of positive information is incidental to the projects primary function as a support and CI/CE operation.

3.  RENEWAL IS RECOMMENDED.

LIFEAT Project Renewal Request

1. It is requested that the attached LIFEAT Renewal Request be approved for the period of 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00, all of which falls within FY 1963. $99,000.00 was programmed for FY 1963 in the WHD allocation.

2. This Project provides the Mexico City Station with a unilateral telephone tap operation which has been in existence for the past 11 years.

3. While the primary object of this Project is not the production of positive intelligence, it was in whole or in part the source of 30 positive information disseminations. In addition to this production and support of other Station operations, it provides ODENVY with information concerning the American Communist Group in Mexico.

4. Emergency recontact instructions have not been established for the agents of this Project since it is believed the operation would cease in case a situation should arise where they would be applicable.

5. No training programs for any LIFEAT personnel are anticipated during the renewal period.

6. WH Division recommends renewal of the LIFEAT Project based on the attached field request. WH Division has cut the field request from $102,193.00 to $99,000.00.

# PROJECT LIFEAT
PROJECT REVIEW

I. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Coverage

As noted in last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage of the official Soviet installation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the parallel liaison project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In early January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the most active Soviet Intelligence officers. This was in response to the continuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Soviet contacts, and the guidance received from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT renewal. As of this date, this coverage has not been active for sufficient time to fully evaluate its usefulness. However, It is believed that such coverage has the potential to add materially to the Station's effort in the CI field. Although not designed to provide positive intelligence, some by-product of this type has been obtained. Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist by Soviet Embassy)
HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)
HMM-6376, 11 May 1962 (Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut TITOV will visit Mexico)

B. Polish Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the only successful, continuing penetration of the target. The information provided to the Interested Case Officer has in the past been described as "unique" and "invaluable". This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as well as the past. Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro- duct of this coverage are:

HMMA-17448, 28 July 1961 (Henryk POTASZ)

C. Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was abie to provide coverage of major firms dealing in U.S. goods transshipment via Mexico to Cuba. This technical operation not only pro- vided initial leads witch alerted the Station to these companies, but also was able to provide continuing Information on the daily activities of the com- pantes Involved. Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for illegal transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their con- tacts and general activities. Samples of the positive intelligence production from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:

D. American Communists in Mexico

As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the 'request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been partially processed by them. During the period July 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of take were passed to local ODENVY for their processing. The most valuable information gleaned from the targets in this field continues to deal with con- tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM).

E. Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and not available from other sources. The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more recently Spanish Republican exiles. The product has been most rewarding in this coverage. Examples of productivity in this past project year:

F. Counter-Intelligence Information

By its latest Related Mission Directive, Mexico City Station's major responsibilities continue to lie in the field of CI/CE matters. LIFEAT was able to provide a valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives. In this field. Coverage included that on Carlos Humberto ILLESCAS, who is acting in a covert liaison capacity between the CP and the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Besides the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field, the following informational reporting was provided:

G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and generally providing other Station operations the secure support only available through a unilateral telephone tap operation. The following is a selected list, together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support and leads provided through LIFEAT:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 16

- 5 -

LIFEAT/Cuban: The most noteworthy LIFEAT contribution to Station efforts in the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the activities of Transcontinental, S. A. in the illegal transshipment of U. S. materials to Cuba via Mexico, LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities of this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican business community by changing the name it operated under to Inversiones Mexicanas, S. A. and changing its location and telephone number. Valuable information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime, methods and contacts used in their procurement, and information on the contacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained.

LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech Intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more importantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when one of their CIS officers, Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempt. Through LIFEAT "livemonitoring" of both the original and followup defection attempts, the KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible attempts by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapment of the KUBARK personnel involved.

LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the mos: "classic" example of the use of a telephone tap in providing a lead which could develop into a vital penetration of the Polish Intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT provided the initial leads which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's development of the operation. It is the Station's opinion that this one instance of service by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year. (Full information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEXI 0463). Also of great interest to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ, Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which had been stolen in the U.S. and driven to Mexico. In this operation, in which a defection attempt was considered, LIFEAT provided not only the initial leads, but also daily operational information vital to the Station's efforts in this case,

LIFEAT/Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this target, Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much vital data on personalities, contacts, and services obtained by the target establishment must be provided. It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this coverage progresses. The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and will


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

- 6 -

continue to provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting of any operations against the Yugoslav target.

LIFEAT/Soviet/Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed supporting information in backing Station double agent operations. In this area the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the agent. LIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case officer to determine the veracity of the agent involved. LIFEAT also provides a needed check upon the activities of the double agent.

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the senior ODACID official in Mexico. LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile factions both involved in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage of targets in this area also enables the Station to keep abreast of the plans and activities of the various groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile community in Mexico City.

LIFEAT/CI-CE Coverage: LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the reporting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S. citizens, especially Communists and Leftists, to Cuba. Through coverage of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who reside in the U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted "Hollywood Ten" to regain their former status in the U.S. film industry.

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has been enhanced through LIFEAT periodic coverage of former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1 and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or personnel. Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations.

H. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the ability of the unilateral LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

-7-

to the liaison forces, well justify the expenditure of funds, time, personnel, and security risk. As it has been noted in the past, that even with the Station's envolvement in the parallel, but liaison, LIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by the present local government administration or a change in government administrations could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project. For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy coverage, must be available to once again undertake coverage of the official Soviet and Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore, LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily available for recall into the Soviet-Czech coverage. It is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT project provides a sübstantial and vital contribution in fulfilling the several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

I. Thère is attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project's prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations.

II. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time. For this reason percentage figures as to completion of project objectives cannot be drawn. However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted in that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced in the period July 1961 through May 1962. LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered.

III. Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of a great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target... such as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so. Until such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of its assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish to reveal its interest or operations to the liaison forces involved in the LIENVOY operation.

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing LIFEAT assets in "hot mike operations which require access to telephone


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

-8-

centrals and cables. The feasibility of using LIFEAT in this type of operation has already been proven, in a recent operation with the LIERODE installation as a target. Seven reels of "hot mike" take were obtained in test runs on checking both the operation (including installation of the "miked" instrument in the office of the head of the LIERODE official installation) and the equipment which was of radical design and conceived and built by the KURIOT technician assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover. Unfortunately, before continuous operation could get underway, the LIERODE installation decided upon complete renovation of its telephone system, including the Installation of a switchboard. This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against this particular target, unless a direct line is installed there. However, it is the intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of interest. In these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in installation, line and series cross maintenance, basehouse procurement and maintenance, and processing of take. From the brief test runs via the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed that "hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly aid the Station in its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Mission Directive.

IV. Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex continued to be good during the period of the project review, with security being stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encountered which were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the success of the LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Headquarters clearances and evaluation of new personnel will continue to be sought on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment.

V. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 'September 1961 for FY 1962 in the amount of $98, 973.03. The proposed budget for FY 1953 is broken down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request, Part II, and totals $102, 168.00.98.943.00!! 94.000.00

VI. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline submitted herewith and in the individuals contracts and oral agreements (memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the various LIFEAT personnel.

Even now with the shift of operational emphasis to Station operations support, it is thought significant to include a list of HMM's produced through April 1962 (10 months of the project year) as a *by-product* in the LIFEAT operation.

# PROJECT LIFEAT

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

1. Area of Operations

This operation is run from México City Station and is concerned with targets located within Mexico City.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, daily Information on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests. Presently, LIFEAT stresses flexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and CI/CE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis.

3. Background

Project LIFEAT was originated on 3 October 1950 as a unilateral telephone tap operation. Actual initiation of operations under this authority occurred on 18 January 1951, and the operation has run continuou.. ly from that date. The pro- Ject was opened with the installation of a single tap and has grown in the past eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in a given month.

The LIFEAT Project is a unilateral operation completely independent from any liaison arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the ma jority of personnel being Indigenous controlled agents.

During the past eleven years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than 83,500 (estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed matertally to the in- telligence gathering activities connected with the Sovlet-Satellite Bloc and more recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition, LIFEAT has been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM), as well as the activities of the exile groups and local Communists.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

- 11 -

With the LIENVOY's assumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovakian official installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continuous coverage of these two targets. These assets were then employed in direct support of Statlon operations--a role ideally suited for a unilateral operation such as LIFEAT, and extremely important to the security and success of Station operations, LIFEAT, after spending much of Project Year 1961 - 1962 programing to this new role and redirecting its assets, has now adjusted to this role and is fully employed in this vital assignment.

f. Maintain supervisior: over baschouses, equipment, and training of personnel assigned to the LIFEAT operations.

## 8. Coordination

a. Information produced by LIFEAT, primarily a Station operational support asset, is closely coordinated with other operations of the Mexico City Station. No operational coordination is required with any other geographical area, but they are advised of any information produced by LIFEAT which may be of interest to them.

b. Project LINOG which supports the principal "outside" Case Officer, David M. WILSTED, is effected in coordination with Project LIFEAT.

c. Coordination with the parallel, but liaison project - LIENVOY, Is closely coordinated between the responsible Case Officers of both projects, particularly relating to the division of coverage between the two operations, thereby assuring that the unilateral LIFEAT operation will not be endangered by the indigenous personnel of the LIENVOY operation.

## 9. Personnel

a. Career and Contract Agents

1.  David M. WILSTED (201-009195), principal "outside" Case Officer.
2.  Wayne C. DRABAND (201-255095), outside assistant to David M. WILSTED, DRABAND was introduced into the LIFEAT operation in November 1961 as a replacement for Ralph B. RAFANELLI who was transferred from Mexico PCS in the fall of 1961. His OA was amended 14 November 1961 to cover his use in the LIFEAT Project. Although DRABAND possessed only limited knowledge of clandestine activity when first employed, under WILSTED's instruction and Case Officer guidance, plus his own willingness and capacity for work, it appears he will prove a valuable addition to the LIFEAT complex.

c. During the past project year the following personnel were dropped from Project LIFEAT:

(1) Ralph B. RAFANELLI (201-176295), staff agent, was reassigned PCS after completing his second tour in Mexico on 8 October 1961.

(2) Olivia N. GLADMON (201-117751), LIFEAT processor, has given notice that due to her planned return to the United States for necessary eye surgery during June 1962, her employment with LIFEAT must be terminated. Agent quit-claim and secrecy agreement have been executed,

(3) Leona C. GANDARA (201-225710), employed by LIFEAT only for standby support during the past year and one half, now is employed for support and clerical work for MKCHARITY.

(4) LIFEUD-20, (formerly LIMITATION-5), (201-102308), and LIFEUD-21, formerly LIMΙΓΑ ΤΙΟΝ-6 (201-117981) will be terminated as of the end of the present LIFEAT project year (30 June 1962). Plans for use of this couple as housekeepers were cancelled when LIFEUD-22 and LIFEUD-23, who are more desirable cholces, became available for LIFEAT use. Termination has been discussed fully with these indigenous agents, and termination arrangements were accomplished on a friendly and mutually agreeable basis (as in all LIFEAT terminations, separation is made on the basis of Mexican custom and/or law).

10. Operational Clearances

See Section 9 above.

11. Cover

There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously employed in the LIFEAT operation. With the new agents employed since the last project renewal, cover is as follows:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

- 16-

a. Wayne C. DRABAND has natural cover of a retired U. S. civil servant presently in Mexico with his wife, an employee of a U. S. government agency.

b. LIEMBRACE-8 has natural cover of a retired U.S. businessman of many years residence in Mexico City.

c. LIFEUD-22 has natural cover of a Cuban exile employed by a Mexican firm in Mexico City. He works regular hours at his cover employment and partakes in LIFEAT activities before and after work and during lunch hours.

d. LIFEUD-23, the mother of LIFEUD-22, has natural cover of housekeeper for her son and performs her LIFEAT dut les only in their home,

12. Contact and Communications

Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officer and the agents employed in the project. These contacts are made in a clandestine manner with varying patterns established for car pickups, foot contacte, and emergency meetings, Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings, When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, meetings are held at night. Entrance to the basehouses by other than the basehousekeepers is made only on the basis of strict necessity; such as need for equipment repair, installation for new line coverages, or line coverage cut off,

Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents is kept to a min- Imum. Pre-arranged open code is used for phone conversations between Case Officers and agents. Alternate and emergency communications have been arranged and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them.

These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints. Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequently to decrease the possibility of arousing the suspicions of the residents of areas in which meet- ings are held.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

## 13. Control and Motivation

- 17 -

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: ideology and financial gain. A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the local police should discovery occur.

## 14. Security

During the past project year there were no incidents which were beyond the capability of the personnel Iminediately involved to isolate and remedy Im- mediately. In contrast to previous years, there was no instance of telephone work crews approaching a basehouse to check or remove the tap lines running to that basehouse. Some of the "crosses" made in the telephone centrals have been removed by the central's workinen, but these are of no danger to the operation unless a full investigation is made of one of these unusual con- nections. During the past project years no such investigation has been under- taken, and no suspicion of the LIFEAT linemen has been revealed to date.

As for the past few years the telephone company is continuing its efforts toward modernization of the Mexico City telephone system. This effort includes changing from overhead lines to underground cables, cleaning off of the unused overhead "dead lines" and Installation of new equipment throughout the city. These innovations will continue to cause security problems for the LIFEAT complex, but it is believed that these problems are not insurmountable. To meet this challange to LIFEAT security and to prepare for the day when access to telephone distribution lines is further reduced by their placement in underground cables, LIFEAT has recently succeeded in having one of its linemen (LIFEUD-2) selected to artend a four month special course in cable work. When he completes this course (in July 1962), LIFEUD-2 will have working access to all cableways and cable termination boards in Mexico City. This access will be invaluable from both the present security and operational standpoints as well as for the future when LIFEAT will be forced to tap directly from the underground telephone cables. As a standard procedure the LIFEAT personnel continuously work to devise new methods to increase security, as well as train in security procedures, so as to continue the high level of security enjoyed by LIFEAT in the past.

## 15. Training

Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for the ex- perienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outside" case officer, David M. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 29

16. Equipment and Support

As noted in last year's renewal request, LIFEAT equipment is generally old and much of it is now obsolete. With funds provided in last year's renewal, LIFEAT (within the past month) has begun to acquire some new equipment, particularly audio recorders. A review of the equipment situation in the LIFEAT setup has convinced both WILSTED and the responsible Case Officer that a near-complete modernization program of the equipment used in LIFEAT must be undertaken during the coming project year. The local KURIOT technician has on a number of ocassions expressed his amazement at the superior product produced by LIFEAT with the outmoded and anctent equipment (In terms of use hours) which the LIFEAT complex had to rely on. Therefore, with the funds requested in Part II of this renewal request. LIFEAT should be completely equipped with adequate gear, particularly audio and dial tape recorders, by the expiration of FY 1953, Admittedly, there is Involved large, one-time expenses in complete replacement of such expensive items during a single project year. However, it is a necessary move, due entirely to great wear borne by the equipment. This wear is now causing such a rash of breakdowns that the outside principal agent must spend a disproportionate amount of his time in maintenance work.

17. Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its Inception In January 1951, and as a vital Station operational support asset, it is planned to continue it Indefinitely.

## PROJECT OUTLINE, PART II

18. Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1962. All figures are U.S. dollars per year ($US 1.00 equals 12.50 Mexican pesos). Changes in estimated costs for particular items will be noted. These reflect not only the continued Inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also the shift in operational emphasis from prime coverage of Soviet/Satellite activities to support of Station operations. In this latter case particular line coverage is of shorter duration, causing greater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and crosses. In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries has been reduced somewhat, due primarily to dropping certain contract agents, while expenses for field agent category has risen, due to the granting during past project year of long overdue salary raises to all but three LIFEAT field agents.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Station, Mexico City

FROM: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: LIFEAT Project Renewal

ACTION REQUIRED: For your information only

REFERENCE: HHO4-A-17199, 12 June 1961

1. The LIFEAT Project was renewed on 8 September 1961.

2. LIFEAT Project was approved for $98,973. Please note that this means a cut of $12,700 from the Station's original request for $111,673. The cut at Headquarters was made for several reasons: 1) to fall within the approved programmed figure of $99,000; 2) during FY 1961 only approximately $81,000 was obligated and since no expansion was planned, an increase of almost $30,000 could not be justified; 3) to keep the approving authority within KUDOVE.

The cuts were made in the following places:

|                    | Station request | Approved |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------- |
| Equipment:         |                 |          |
| Local purchase     | $ 2,500         | $1,800   |
| New equipment      | 4,500           | 2,500    |
| Other Ops expenses | 15,000          | 5,000    |

3. KUTUBE and KUDESK Staffs concurred in recommending renewal. KUTUBE/D remarked that the project included coverage of highly selective KUTUBE/D interests through technical means and stated that the project provided several items of operational interest not otherwise obtainable, as well as operational leads and background data useful in target assessment. KUDESK Staff reiterated that coverage should continue to be given to carefully selected known or suspect Soviet/Satellite agents in support of the Station's intensified KUDESK type program.

# SUBJECT: Request for Approval of Project LIFEAT

1.  It is requested that the LIFEAT Froject be renewed for the period 1 July 1961 through 30 June 1962 for a total of $98,974. This project has been programmed for $99,000 and funds are available in WH Division for FY 1962. During the last fiscal year approximately $81,000 was obligated.

2.  No training programs for any LIFEAT personnel are anticipated for the renewal period.

3.  Any number of emergency conditions could be listed which might affect the smooth running of this operation. Among then would be the break in diplomatic relations or hot war between Mexico and the United States or the discovery of this unilateral asset by the Mexican Government. Emergency recontact instructions have not been established for the agents of this project since it seems likely that the operation would cease in case of such conditions and the agents would be of no further value.

4.  This project was the source of 128 intelligence reports during the past year, 85 of which were disseminated, The remainder were used for Headquarters background only since the information was either partially previously reportad, overt, or of no interest to customer agencies. The following evaluations were received:

"Mexican Technicians Going to Work in Cuba" - State Department said this report was of moderate importance and that the information was new and useful.

"Nicaraguan Revolutionary Activities in Mexico" - State Department said that this report was of moderate importance and that the information was new and useful.

"Propaganda Activities of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico" - State Department said that this report was of moderate importance and useful as new information. USIA commented that the same report was of major importance.

"Mexican Government Purchase of Soviet Radioisotopes" - 081 reported that this dissemination was of little importance and that the information was already sufficiently known. ORR said that it was of moderate importance and wore details were required.

PROJECT LIFFAT

PROJECT REVIEW

I. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Embassy

LIFFAT technical surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and Commercial Office telephone lines was discontinued on 22 June 1960 for security reasons, The withdrawal of LIMAT from coverage of this target hinged on the 20 June 1960 suggestion by LITENSOR to Chief of Station, Mexico City, that the liaison tap operation LIENVOY undertake operations against the Soviet/Satellite targets located in Mexico City. In order not to reveal to LITENSOR that a unilateral tap operation was already providing coverage of these targets, it was necessary for the Chief of Station to agree to LIENVOY extending its coverage to include Soviet/Satellite operations. LIFEAT Immediately severed its coverage of both Soviet and Polish phones so as not to jeopardize the continuing unilateral LIMEAT operation and the personnel involved therein. No security breach resulted from the switch from LIFFAT to LIENVOY coverage due largely to the thoroughness and speed of the LIHAT personnel. LIFEAT security and compartmentation was not harten to any degree what-ever. (Note: LIFMAT again resumed coverage of the Polish Legation--now Embassy--when it developed that LIENVOY did not have the ready capacity to provide "take" from both the Czechoslovakian and Polish official installations.)

B. Polish Embassy

During the past project year, LIVAT remained the primary source of information on this target and the only successful, continuing penetration of the target, technical or otherwise. The interested Case Officer has described the LIFEAT contribution as "unique" and "invaluable". Examples of the positive intelligence product of the LIFEAT/Polish coverage are:

H0MA-15431, 3 August 1960 (Aleksander SEXIER)

HM-5133, 22 August 1960 (Promotion of Polish Minister in Mexico to Rank of Ambassador)

## C. Cuban Embassy

The emphasis of the LIFEAT operation during the past year has been placed on coverage of Cuban official, intelligence and propaganda activities. Direct support of Station operations in the JNZIP area has rendered immeasurable assistance to the responsible Case Officers. On various occasions LIFFAT suppert has involved extended periods of live-monitoring target telephones, thereby providing excellent security for Station assets taking part in sensitive operations, LIFFAT/Cuban coverage has also enabled the Station officers to check the veracity and activities of various penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy, again providing increased operational security and increased exploitation of these agent assets. Although LIFEAT has been employed primarily as an operational support asset in the Cuban area, the following are examples of the valuable and abundant positive intelligence production furnished LLITAT:

HM-5044, 9 July 1960 (0il From Nexico For Cuba)

HITA-15499, 17 August 1900 (ANSEAD-1)

## D. American Communists In Nexico

As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the request of ODENVY, and the production has been partially processed

by them. During the period July 1960 through May 1961, approximately
280 reels of raw "take" were passed to local ODENVY for their processing.
The most valuable information gleaned from coverage of the targets in
this field continues to deal with contacts, travel, and activities of the
American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM). The following is a sample
of the reporting based on the LIFFAT coverage provided in this area
during the past project year:

HEFA-15467, 10 August 1960 (Travel of Noah SEHORER and Family)
HEFA-15481, 12 August 1960 (Marianne de PERALTA (nee YAMPOLSKY)

HNA-16747, 29 March 1961 (Enos and Maria WICHER)
HMA-16802, 7 April 1961 (Noah and Anna SEHORER)

E. Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continues to provide data on the exile and revolutionary groups
active in Mexico. The bulk of the LIFFAT effort in this field was
directed toward the coverage of the Nicaraguan exiles, and the results
were most rewarding in this area. Examples of productivity:

1021-5264, 2 November 1960 (Nicaraguan Exile Activities in Mexico)
HI7-5192, 27 November 1960 (Edelberto YOMEZ Espinoza)
107-5275, 30 December 1960 (Travel of Honduran Leonel Roberto

Channel for Messages to Cuba)
100-A-17025, 17 May 1961 (Travel of Guatemalans)

P. Counter-Intelligence Information

Mexico City Station's major responsibilities continued to lie in the
field of CI/CE matters during the past year, and LIFEAT was able to
provide a substantial contribution toward the attainment of the Station's
objectives in this field. In particular, coverage of the following known

Comminists added much to the Station's efforts: Xavier GUEPRERO Saucedo and his wife, Clara Porcel de Gommo Carmen PRUFAU Civit; and Juản Lits CAPOS Villalobos. Besides the operational support in the CI/CE field, the following-informational reporting was provided by LIFEAT:

HP-5154, 31 August 1960 (Activities of Vicente LOMBARDO Toledano, Méxican Marxist Leader)

10-5333, 9 December 1960. (Clara Porcet de GUERRERO)

HT-5652, 19 Hay 1961 (Communist Support of Student Demonstration at Puebla)

1-5655, 19 May 1961 (Meeting of Luis MARTINEZ Nenocal wi Communists in Nexico)

## G. Operational Leads and Support Frovided Other Station Operations

During the past project year, LIFFAT continued to support Mexico City Station through the timely production of useful leads, notably in the Cleld of Cuban operations, and provision of continuing support to other Station operations. The following is a selective list of the use made of leads provided by LIFFAT:

LIFTAT/Cuban: In this phase of the LIFEAT operation the most important operational function has been the use of LIFEAT leads in checi.ing the veracity and activities of the KUPARK agents in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. LIFEAT live-monitoring was employed in the case of Guillermo ERNANDEZ Vera to de ermine the suchers of this suspected Cuban ecetration of the ANIRON proram in contacting Cuban officials or fro-Cuban Mexican officials while he was kela in custod, by fexican ammoristen Station assess. In another care LIHAT roviden leads which enabled Station assets or clandestine rrect between a caster of the Cuban Emuassy staff and one Manuel ROJAS Villa (akt. James Bradford STEWART), a fugitive from ODYOKE and a potential CASTRO agent, and ultimately return ROJAS to ODYOKE Jurisdiction. LIFAT was also able to determine the whereabouts of another suspected CASTRO agent, Oscar RODRIGUEZ Koruna, LIFEAT leads and suport provided Increased security for Station assets involved during the defection of Jose FARIDO Llada, CASTRO "propaganda" minister, and provided leads for KUCAGE play on the reaction to the defection within the Cuben Erbassy in Mexico.

LIMAT/Pelich: LIFEAT provided vital support in the RECOR: Recruitment attempt which increased the security of the operation and gave a quick and secure means of evaluating the chances of success of the operation. In this effort, LIFFAT support included len;, periods of live-monitoring three separate telephone lines. LISWAT leads aiso pointed out a local care which is a frons for much Polish intelligence activity in the

Mexico City area. It has been determined throud: LIFEAT leads that this case is headquarters for a suspected Polish technical operation directed against an official U.S. Installation in Mexico City. LIFEAT also provided support for a Station counter audio operation against the Polish Embassy in Mexico City. Through LIFEAT leads proper support for the operation was arranged.

Coverage of a CI/CE nature was explcited in covering travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba, and the travel of U.S. citizens, especially Communists and lettists, to Cupe, Travel plans of American Cormmunists were provided to ODOMY well in avance of the actual travel. Activities of local Commmists and their participation in demonstrations and CASTRO-support projects was shown through LIFFAT information.

H. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station operations, the CI/CE Information, and in particular the audity of the unilateral LIMEAT operation to cover sensitive targets kithout revealing Station Interest to lluison forces, well justity the expenifure of fumis, time, personnel, eni security risk. It is to be noted that even though the Station is involved in the parallel LIENVOY liaison operation, a change in the attitude of the local coverment or the change in local government administration could well end KUBARK participation in that liaison project. For that reason LIFEAT must be available to resume the coverare of the Soviet/Satellite targets which !orovioural provided. It is recolzat the Station that the LIFEAT complex, if allowed to distrate, could set be readily reorganized if need for its cervices in the Soviet Satellite field was required at a future date. Therefore, LIFFA's present ortentation, nou,d. toward

of Soviet/Satellite operations. Of necessit, LIFEAT operations in certain areas have been curtalled to acre extent and total coverage reduced during the trial period when cutie lines were being formed in riation to operating with a parallel bar Hatson operation (1.c.,

LIVOY). However, it is the Station's o, infon that even with the temporarily reduced coverage provided by LINA, this project still provides a substantial and essential corortalen in fulfilling the several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

II. Promess of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFTA Project are of a contfauing nature and are therefore not considered for Aifillment during any given period of time. For this reason percentage fihures as to completion of project objectives cannot be drawn. However, an indication of the coverage provided in sorking

toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted in that 12,00 pares of
raw text were produced in the period July 1960 through May 1961. LIFFAT
has been in daily operation during the review period with the average number
of lines covered being 12. Generally, this coverage can be broken down
as follows:

Cuban Embassy and related lines 4
Folish Embassy and related lines 3
American Comminists 2
Targets of Opportunity 3

12 TOTAL

III. Planning for the Future

Following the surgestion provided by Headquarters in renewing Project LIFAT
for FY 1961 (FY and project year coincide), the Station is expending every
effort to maintein LIFFAT as a secure, compartmented, mailateral operation
even though on the presently reduced seale, so as to have readily available
for service this flexible support asset with its proven capacity for coverage
of almost any target in Nexico City. Also in line with Headquarters
suggestion LIFEAT will attempt to increase its coverage of those individuals
suspected of maintaining clandestine contact with the AIS.

In the future, the unilateral II:FAT operation, with the removal from its
responsibility the coverage of the Soviet and Czech lines, will send to be
more flexible, with treater percentage of its capacity available for chift
ing to new targets as they are presentea, and able to atta ing to
nen situacions. It is noted that this may result in a lower leg of
positive intelligence production, init will increase the CI/CE prometion.
which has always been taste to the LIFFAT: roject.

Γ.. Performance of Afenta

A.e overall performance of all agents employed in the LINAT complex
continued to be good during the period of the project review, with security
being stressed in all panses of the operation. No security prouleas were
encountered which were not colved by the personnel Involvet. Since the
success of ie LIMAT oneration depends larvely on the security of its
personnel, Headquarters clearances and evaluation of new personnel will
continue to be sought on dhore new additions who pass a Fortet ficla
nasessment.

V. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFFAT was granted to Augurt 100 for the
FY 1961 in the amount of SONI.01.00. The propose i Puage: for FY 1962 is
broken down in the attached Field Project Outline, Part II, and totals
$98,973.00..

PROJECT LIFEAT
PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

1. Area of Operations

This operation is run from the Mexico City Station and is concerned with targets located in Mexico City.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, daily information on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests. Presently, coverage of the official Cuban and Polish installations have top priority in the LIFEAT operation.

3. Background

Project LIFEAT was originally approved on 3-October 1950 as a unilateral telephone tap operation. Actual initiation of operations under this authority occurred on 18 January 1951, and the operation has run continuously from that date. The project was opened with the installation of one tap and has grown in the past ten years to continuous coverage of from 12 to 20 lines.

The LIFEAT project is a unilateral operation completely independent from any liaison arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK staff and contract employees with the greater majority of personnel being, in fact, enous controlled agents.

During the past ten years, Project LIFFAT has produced more than 76,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and has contributed materially to the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet and Satellite Bloc and more recently with the activities of the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition, LIFFAT has been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACG), as well as the activities of exile groups and local Communists.

For objective g:

f. Telephone conversations originating from residences or offices of prominent exile leaders in Mexico City.

For objective h:

g. Telephone conversations which can be monitored from targets of opportunity.

7. Tasks

Case Officer - Edward F. SECHEN
Assistant Case Officer - Jeremy L. NIARCOS

a. Supervise the operational and administrative activities of all LIFEAT personnel; staff, contract and indigenous.

b. Maintain awareness of and provide direction in all operational matters pertaining to the management of the LIFEAT Project.

c. Provide guidance and day-to-day supervision of the operational phases of LIFEAT coverages in the field of Polish, Cuban, and American Communists operations.

d. Coordinate information received from the LIFEAT coverage with other Station operations, and coordinate as necessary with the Station personnel responsible for the parallel LIFINVOY operation.

e. Maintain LINEAT capabilities for mounting operations against targets of opportunity.

f. Maintain supervision over warehouses, equipment, and training of personnel assigned to the LINEAT operation.

8. Coordination

a. Information produced by LIFEAT, primarily a Station operational support asset, is closely coordinated with other operations of the Mexico City Station. No operational coordination is required with any other geographical area, but they are advised of any information produced by LIFEAT which may be of interest to them.

b. Project LINOG which supports the principal "outside" Case Officer, David M. WILSTED, is effected in coordination with Project LIFEAT.

c. Coordination with the parallel, but liaison project, LIENVOY is closely organized within the Station in two fields: (1) the daily checking


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

SECRET/KAPOK

-12-

between Case Officers of both projects, particularly relating to the division of coverage between the two operations, to assure that the unilateral LIFEAT operation will not be endangered by the indigenous personnel of the LIENVOY operation; and, (2) the daily processing of LIENVOY/Soviet "icke" by the LIFFAT processor and basehousekeeper Carol K. ZDISEISTER. The Station believes this latter point does not "cross" operations unnecessarily since ZINSELSTER's long and discrete cervice within the LIFEAT complex gives her both the sense of security and the background necessary for secure processing of the Soviet "take". (Note: The processed Soviet material is not returned to the liaison forces after receipt from ZDISEISTER, but is returned to the Station where it is summarized by Station personnel and then passed to liaisen as having come from KURARK Headquarters.) ZEISICISTAR is equally valuable, and indeed essential, in her LIFEAT caschoucekeeper assignement because of her experience in dealing with the security problems arising from conducting a technical basehouse, as well as her ideal natural cover as wife of one of Mexico's foremost medical doctors.

9. Personnel

a. Staff agents

Ralph B. RAFANELLI (201-176295), who for the past four years has functioned as the assistant to c "outside" Case Officer for the LIFEAT operation, completes his second tour in June 1961 and will return to Headquarters PCS during the fall or early winter of 1961. It is plened to replace nim with a locally recrm.ited person, ODYOE citizen if possible, ino possesses natural commercial cover. Several candluntes are presently ocing considered for this position. As soon as the Station is able to determine the nest qualified individual, full PR I and II and clearance request will be forwarded for Headquarters processing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

SECRET/KAPOK

-14-

(2) Woodrow D. GABBOTT (201-14465) is now employed exclusively as an outside contact for the Station's Satellite Case Officer and should no longer be considered as a member of the LIFEAT complex.

(3) Wallace L. KAWOHL (201-033959) was terminated as an active agent in June 1960 at his own request and with the concurrance of the Station. Agent quit-claim and secrecy agreement were obtained. No security problems are considered likely to occur since FAWOHL's parents continue to be employed as basehousekeepers for LIFEAT and are dependent upon continued LIFFAT salary for their livelihood. At the time of the termination, it was realized that he would continue to enter the basehouse which his parents controlled, and therefore his clearance was amended to reflect this situation. (Reference: HCA-15246).

10. Operational Clearances

See Section 9 above.

11. Cover

There are no changes in the cover of the personnel presently employed in Project LIFEAT from that noted in previous project renewals.

12. Contact and Communications

Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officersand the agents employed in the project. These contacts are made in a clandestine manner wilu. varying patterns established for ear pickups, fool contacts, an emergency meetings. Fre-arranged simats are employed in metoing accorgishing the meetings. When heavy or bulky raterial is to be passed, peetings are held at night. All movement in and out of the basehouses by Case Officers is done in cars ostensibly owned by the agents residing in those barehouses. Entrance to the basehouses on foot by other than the baschousekeepers is made only in emergency cituations.

Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents is kept to a minimum. Pre-arranged open code is used for phone conversations between Case Officers and agents.

Alternate and emergency communications have been arranged and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them.

These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints. Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changea frequently to decrease the possibility of arousing the suspicions of the residents of areas in which meetings are held.

SECRET/KAPOK


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

### 13. Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: ideology and financial gain. A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the local police should discovery occur.

### 14. Security

During the past project year there were no incidents which were beyond the capability of the personnel imediately involved to isolate and remedy imediately. One basehouse was closed for "cooling off" after a telephone company work party care to the basehouse to check the lines running to it. This party was stalled long enough to cut back the "tap" lines at the roof level and the house cleared of all compromising equipment and material. Later the work party entered and checked the lines which proved to be "dead" lines. The extra lines were then removed and the work party left the premises and there was no further trouble. (Note: In Mexico City there is much "dead line" running throughout the city which causes no end of difficulty for the telephone company in installation and repair work. Therefore, the phone company assigns work parties to various areas to clean up the extra unused "dead lines" In order to bring a degree of organization to the telephone system. This work is now being pursued vigorously and is approaching completion in large areas of the city.) The basehouse involved in the above incident has now been moved to a different location and is back in operation.

At the present time the telephone company is making a general effort to modernize the Mexico City telephone system. This effort includes changing from overhead lines to underground cables, cleaning off the unused overhead "dead lines", and installation of new equipment throughout the city. These innovations will cause increasing security problems for the LIFEAT complex, but it is believed that the problems are not Insurmountable. Part of the solution will of necessity involve the use of a greater number of base-houses to diversify the coverage and to reduce the number of lines running to any one basehouse. This will cause an increase in expense for the project, but is considered desirable and necessary. It may eventually be necessary for LIFEAT to enter the underground cables in order to provide access to selected targets and maintain the security of the basehouses. The LIFEAT personnel are continually working to device new methods as well as maintaining training in security so as to continue the high level of security enjoyed by LIFEAT in the past.

### 15. Training

Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for experienced agents is handled primarily by the "outside" Case Officer, David H. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

16. Equipment and Support

As has been mentioned in last year's renewal request, much of the LIFEAT equipment, upon whose reliability the success of the information collection is based, will require replacement in the near future. The great percentage of the equipment has been in long and continuous service, while much of the special equipment is no longer being manufactured. When present diminishing commercial stocks of replacement parts are exhausted, new units will be required for LIFEAT with the attendant large, one-time purchase expense.

17. Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception in January 1951, and it is planned to continue it indefinitely.

1.  The LIFEAT Project was approved on 26 August 1960 for a total of $98,901. Headquarters reduced the original request from the field to bring the total Project budget more in line with the programmed figure of $90,000 and the actual obligations of the previous year, which were only $73,884. The following changes were made on the field's request:

|                                                                 | Field Request | Approved  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Salaries: Ralph B. RAFANELLI (to reflect legislative pay raise) | $ 6,505.00    | $6,995.00 |
| Miscellaneous Operating Expenses                                | 25,000.00     | 9,000.00  |

2.  Staff comments on the Project renewal request were:

a) KUTURE/OPS said that the Station is to be commended on its handling of the requested Bloc coverage by LIENVOY while maintaining LIFEAT capability and limiting coverage to those lines most profitable. KUTURE noted the increased emphasis on exploitation of operational information. In order to continue this aspect of the operation, the Station is faced with the difficult problem of selectivity in targeting and processing take from these two large projects. Every possible effort should be made to increase the efficiency of processing to maintain LIFEAT at its present high level. In KUTUBE/OPS's opinion, LIFEAT personnel and capability must be carefully maintained in face of the easier but less secure LIENVOY.

b) KUDESK stated that this unilateral asset should be continued despite the fact that we are running a similar operation with the local government. It is hoped that the Station will soon be able to use this asset in the investigation of individuals known to be in clandestine contact with the RIS, for the purpose of determining whether or not they may be recruited.

c) KUTUBE/D notes that the project has been of high value.

DATE: 22 JULY 1960

1. It is requested that the LIPUT Project be renewed for the period 1 July 1960 through 30 June 1961 for a total of $98,901.00. Last fiscal year the project was approved for $123,830 of which $73,884 was obligated. The approved progresand figure was $90,000 for Fiscal Year 1961. The extra $9,000 required would come from the following programed projecten

```
LIMTER - $2,000
LIVERY - $1,000
LIENVOY -$6,000.-
```

2. Subsequent to the preparation by the Station of the attached Project review and renewal request for LIFT, the following situstion developed in Mexico tich has directly affected the entire LIPSAT Project. At a meeting with the Chief of station on 25 June 1960, LITESR asked the Station and LIANT to iradistely begin covering the Soviet, Polish and Czech Pabassy under LEWOY. LIT suggested that the Mexicans trans- late the Spanish and that the Station forvard the tapes to hashingtos for translation of the Russtan, Folish and Czech portions. The Chief of Station had no alternative but to express great interest in the coverage of targeta of such importancs. In order to protect the security of the LIMAT opere- tions, the Station stopped the LDTRICK and LITAS (LIVERY had not been in operation for the past six months for sscurity reasons) coverage on 22 June, prior to the LOI activation. It was determined that LIENCY would cover 5 Soviet and 2 Crach lines. The take continue to be processed by 16415- TAR and LIEINEN. The LERTON sonitors extract from the Spanish only the most Laportant points for the daily reswans which are passed to LINKS. LELTEM has been toll we will infora hin of pertinent information ob- tained (ostensibly from licadquartern processing) of the Soviet and Crech text for passing to LITROSOR. LIFEAT will contimss its unilateral covarap of Folish and other targets of interest.

3. The Station does not anticipate any problsa connected with the exploitation of leads since LR has evinced no interest in this sa ter. In view of the lack of language capabilities by the Mexicans and ar ability to control what is passed (ostensibly frea sadquarters), the Sto- tion sees no problems arising frma the present arrangement.

4. The Station does not intend to cut down on independent LIFEAT operations since there are plenty of targets to keep both LINDIOY and LI-FOAT occupied.

5. The LIFEAT Project was the source of 99 positive intelligence reports, 72 of which were disseminated. Those not disseminated were considered by Headquarters to be of value for operational background or were outdated. KR made the following evaluations of LIFEAT reports:

"Mexican Interest in Procurement of Naphthalene from Czechoslovakia," of value, probably true, and of importance to receive further reports.

"Soviet Commercial Activities," of value, probably true, and of importance to receive further reports.

"Soviet Plans to Sell Newsprint to Mexican Government Agency," of little importance.

"Soviet Negotiations for Mexican Cotton," of average value, useful as new information.

The Department of State made the following evaluations of LIFEAT reports:

"Mexican Efforts to Sell Sugar to the USSR," of value, possibly true, and of importance to receive further reports.

"Purchase of Soviet Tractors by Mexican Government," of slight value.

"Soviet Negotiations for Mexican Cotton," of average value, useful in confirming other reports.

6. The Station used LIFEAT information in the preparation of memoranda directed to the Embassy and FBI representatives in Mexico in reply to local requests for information. During the period July 1959 through May 1960, 151 memoranda were furnished the Embassy and 69 memoranda were furnished the FBI based on LIPAT information.

7. WH Division feels that the positive and CK information received from LIFEAT is invaluable. Most of the information is not available from other Station assets. Reports on travel and the identification of target personalities often serve to confirm information previously received. LIFEAT assets also have been used effectively to check on recently-terminated agents to ascertain that the termination was secure. LIFEAT also has been used to check on reports by double agents that they have contacted or been contacted by their respective Soviet or Satellite contacts.

8. Information received from LEROTE is passed to WH/4 and any operations undertaken on the basis of such information are closely coordinated with that Branch.

9. Information received free the LITAS, LIVEKI, and LIMERICK phases is supplied the ES and SR Case Officers at the Station for exploitation of leads and extracting of pertinent background information. At Headquarters there is close coordination between ES, SR and WH on the dissemination of positive reports and the operational exploitation of CE/CI leads. C/EE/O stated on 18 July 1960 that the Czech desk fully endorses the renewal of the LIFTAT Project and that they have found the information obtained from this project to be especially useful in following the movements of persons of interest and the activity and identification of target personnel. Please see attached memoranda from EX/P and SR which express their support of this project renewal.

10. Project BESMOOTH, which supports Woodrow D. CALDOT, who processes the LITMUS take, is coordinated with Project LIFEAT.

11. Emergency recontact instructions will be arranged with the agents under this project if a situation which might require such instructions threatens Mexico.

12. It is requested that the LIENVOT Project be renewed on the basis of this memorandum and the attached revises and renewal request prepared by the Mexico City Station.

# PROJECT REVIEW - PROJECT LIFEAT

1. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Embassy

1) Soviet Commercial Activities:

During the past project year, the LIMERICK phase of Project LIFEAT has provided detailed and continuing reports on the increased Soviet efforts to participate in Mexican commercial markets. The following is a partial but representative list of the reports submitted on this subject.

HMM-4322, 12 June 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico.
HMM-4567, 6 November 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico,
HMM-4355, 1 April 1960, Soviet Purchase of Mexican Cotton,
HMM-4857, 6 April 1960, Soviet Purchase of Mexican Pineapple,
HMM-4358, 6 April 1960, Soviet Plan to Sell Newsprint to Mexican Government Agency,

2) Soviet Diplomatic Activities:

Project LIFEAT provided coverage of many of the Soviet Diplomatic activities in Mexico. It was able to show the relation- ships maintained between the Soviet and Satellite missions in Mexico, as well as the increased official contact between the Cuban and Soviet governments,

MEXI-4304, 21 August 1959, Meeting os Soviet and Cuban Ambassadors to Mexico.
HMM-4618, 20 November 1959, Increased Relations of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico with the Latin American Diplomatic Missions.
HMM-4768, 8 February 1960, Preparation of Soviet Propaganda in Mexico for Shipment to Cuba.

3) Soviet Cultural Activities:

LIFEAT has provided detailed information concerning the Soviet cultural activities in Mexico. Examples of such reports are:

HMM-4415, 5 August 1959, Soviet Plans to Bring Soviet Exposition to Mexico.

HMM-4449, 28 August 1959, Soviet Pians to Bring Pyatnitskiy
Chorus to Mexico from Canada.

HMMA-14677, 16 March 1960, Soviet Cultural Activities.

4) Background Information on, and Movement of, Soviet Officials:

Through LIFEAT information, the Station has been able to maintain
a current roster of the Soviet Embassy personnel assigned to Mexico.
LIFEAT has been further utilized to give information on job assignments
within the Soviet Embassy, and to determine in advance departures, arrivals,
and replacements of Embassy personnel. Large quantities of background
personality Information concerning the official and private lives of members
of the Soviet staff were also provided.

HMM-4323, 11 June 1959, Scheduled Travel of Soviet Officials.
HMMA-14065, 6 November 1959, Activities of Soviet Ambassador
Vladimir Ivanovich BAZYΚΙΝ.
HMMA-13614, 24 August 1959, Retirement System for Soviet
Diplomats.

5) Goods and Services:

Throughout the past year, LIFEAT information has been of use to
Project LIMESA. Of particular note have been leads concerning varlous
properties in which the Soviets were interested.

6) Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy:

LIFEAT material which does not fall into any one category but which
deals with the Soviets and their association and related activities has been
reported as necessary.

B. Czech Legation*[^1]

Information obtained on the Czech Legation during the period under
review was essentially the same as that obtained from the Soviet Embassy.
Although this target was covered only from July 1959 to January 1960 (due
to the security problem posed by extensive telephone company cable
renovation work in the vicinity of the basehouse serving the target), valuable
intelligence was gained during the period of actual coverage. Examples

C. The Polish Legation

The type of LIFEAT information gathered on the Polish Legation closely parallels that gathered from the Soviet and Czech targets, LIFEAT remains the primary source of information on this target.

HMM-4458, August 1959, Proposed Mexican Art Exhibit in Poland,
ΗΜΜΑ-13713, 11 September 1959, Influence of Polish Minister on Mexican U. N. Voting.

ΗΜΜΑ-15055, 27 May 1960, Activities of Alexander BEKIER.

D. American Communists in Mexico

Most of the targets in this group have been covered at the request of ODENVY, and the production has been partially processed by them. Approximately 370 reels were passed to ODENVY for their processing during the period June 1959 April 1960. The most valuable type of information obtained on these targets deals with travel, contacts, and activities of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM). The following is a sample of the reports furnished through coverage of this target group.

ΗΜΜΑ-13792, 25 September 1959, Albert and Margaret MALTZ.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

## E. Cuban Embassy

LIFEAT has provided timely information on the activities and personalities of the Cuban Embassy. Of particular interest has been the indications provided by LIFEAT of closer relations and increasing contact between the Cuban and Soviet officials in Mexico. LIFEAT was also able to provide a firm indication of the Soviet-Cuban announcement of resumption of diplomatic relations two weeks in advance of the actual event. Examples of LIFEAT Cuban coverage are:

HMM-4489, 24 September 1959, Recall of Cuban Military Attaches in Mexico.

HMM-4649, 4 December 1959, Pro-Cuba Publication in Mexico.

HMM-4907, 27 April 1960, Projected Joint Announcement by Cuban and Soviet Governments.

HMM-4919, 29 April 1960, Travel to Cuba of Soviet Ambassador in Mexico.

## F. Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continued to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups active in Mexico. Coverage of the Nicaraguan Communist exiles was particularly rewarding for the operational information provided.

HMM-4317, 12 June 1959, Letter from a Guatemalan Communist Concerning the Seventh World Festival of Youth.

MEXI-4271, 13 August 1959, Travel of Nicaraguan Communists.

MEXI-4488, October 1959, Travel of Dra. Concepcion PALACIOS Herrera, Nicaraguan Communist.

HMM-4967, 25 May 1960, Acivities of Rafael RAMIREZ Delgado.

## G. LAURICLE Information

During the period of the project review, LIFEAT, as in the past, continued to contribute materially to several matters of LAURICLE interest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 71

SECRET/KADOK

-5-

## H. Counter-Intelligence Information

CI/CE matters continued to constitute a major portion of the Mexico City Station's priority objectives during the review period, Project LIFEAT was able to provide a substantial contribution to the attainment of these objectives. Of particular note in this respect has been coverage provided on known Communist Party members, especially valuable being that provided on Juan Luis CAMPOS Villalobos.

## I. Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Station Operations

During the period covered by this project review, LIFEAT.continued to support the Mexico City Station through its timely production of leads which were especially useful, and in most cases essential, in assuring the success of other Station operations. The following is a list, necessarily selective, of the use made of leads from, and support of other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT.

*   LIFEAT/LIMERICK: 1) Of special note is the support provided to the Station's AEIMPULSE operation, Leads and information rendered by LIFEAT enabled the responsible Case Officer to prepare adequately for this recruitment attempt of an officer of the Soviet Embassy. Following the actual attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERICK was used as a security device to protect the Station assets employed in the operation. 2) As noted in I A. (5) above, Project LIMESA was provided with continuing support by Project LIFEAT. Notable among the Information and leads provided were those concerning specific properties which the Soviets were interested in renting and/or buying. 3) LIFEAT has provided a check on double-agent LITARDY-1, giving verification of his activities and contacts. A similar check has also been provided on the activities of informant LIPAGAN-1.

LIFEAT/LIVERY: 1) This phase of LIFEAT closely supported the projected LITACIT physical penetration operation aimed at the LIVERY establishment in Mexico City. LIFEAT provided essential information on the rosters of night duty officers as well as background information on the target. 2) LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the installation of technical surveillance against LITACH. Without the information provided by LIFEAT, this operation would have been extremely hazardous at best, and probably would have been entirely impossible.

SECRET/KADOK


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

SECRET / KADOK

-6-

LIFEAT/LITMUS: 1) LIFEAT provided information which lead to the successful recruitment of agent BEYAN who was in a position to provide information on BESOOT. 2) LITMUS leads also lead to the attempted, but unsuccessful, recruitment of one Una WARREN, believed to have been a contact of Polish officials in Mexico. 3) LIFEAT leads also lead to the surveillance of a clandestine meeting of Alexander BEKIER, Polish Counselor of Legation in Mexico. Due to the advance notice of the meeting given by LIFEAT, MKCHARITY was given time to plan technical coverage of the meeting and prepare especially fabricated equipment for this coverage. 4) LIFEAT was also responsible for the discovery of the location of a Polish Intelligence basehouse. This information was operationally important to the responsible Case Officer.

LIFEAT/LIERODE: In this phase of the LIFEAT project leads have been most rewarding in terms of agents actually recruited and operations supported by LIFEAT provided information. 1) LIERODE produced leads which were directly responsible for the recruitment of agents LITANGO-1 and LITAMIL-3, while providing security check and information which have increased the value of agent LITANGO. 2) The defections of LITAINT-1 and LITAG-1 were greatly aided by LIFEAT leads and information. The internal reaction to the defections in the target establishment were also readily available through LIFEAT. 3) At present LIERODE is providing coverage, both from a security and informational standpoint, of the attempt to place a recruited agent as Mexico-based advisor to a high official of the Cuban Intelligence. This operation is largely dependent upon LIFEAT leads and support for security coverage of the agent's activities. 4) LIFEAT/LIERODE has been unusually successful in providing information which has enabled the Station to identify nearly all the Cuban agents operating in Mexico. Due to the increasing importance of the Cuban target, these revelations are of utmost importance.

Coverage of a CI/CE nature was provided by LIFEAT targeted against a recruited member of the Mexican Communist Party, and has produced leads on semi-clandestine travel of party members behind the Iron Curtain, as well as providing a check on the veracity of the agent.

Project LIFEAT has been employed also in support of the highly sensitive LIEMIT operation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

J. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided to other Station operations, the CE information obtained, and the positive intelligence gathered by Project LIFEAT well justify the expenditure of KUBARK assets in terms of funds, personnel, time and security risk. The information produced by this operation has materially contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

K. There is attached herewith a complete list of HMMS produced from LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1959 through May 1960. (See attached sheet.)

II. Progress of the Operation

Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are unique in that they are of a continuing nature and not designed to be fulfilled within a given period, no statistics can be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each objective can be calculated. A general indication can be given of the coverage provided by the project when it is noted that approximately 15,000 pages of raw text were provided in the July 1959 to May 1960 period. LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the number of lines covered varying from 12 to 18. Generally, these can be broken down as follows:

Soviet Embassy 5 lines
Polish Legation and Polish
Counselor 3 lines
Czech Legation (Embassy) 2 lines (Coverage suspended January '60 for reason given in I. B above)
American Communists 2 lines
Cuban Embassy 3 lines
Targets of Opportunity 3 lines

III. Planning for the Future

Following the suggestion and guidance provided by Headquarters when renewing Project LIFEAT for FY 1960, the Station plans to limit its coverage to no more than twenty lines at any given time, with the possible exception of targets of opportunity which could be covered for short periods


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

SECRET/KADOK

-3-

in addition to the normal coverage. The coverage of Soviet and Satellite installations will remain basic to LIFEAT and will be exploited to the maximum degree possible. Due to the increased importance of information on Cuban activities, coverage of the Cuban Embassy and personnel staffing the Embassy will be increased during the coming project year. Targets of Opportunity will continue to be explolted as permitted by personnel, equipment, and access-limitations.

IV. Performance of Agents

The general overall performance of the agents employed under LIFEAT continued to be good with security being stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encountered which were not readily solved by the personnel concerned, Since a high degree of security is required for the operation of LIFEAT, it is planned that any possible agent candidates will be thoroughly screened and Headquarters clearance obtained before they are in any way approached for operational use.

V. Expenditures During the Period Under Review

Approval for the renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted on 16 July 1959, for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960, in the amount of $123,830. In ito continuing attempt to provide practical economy without deereasing operational efficiency, Station Mexico submits the itemized-proposed LIFEAT budget for FY 1961 (contained in the attached Field Project Outline, Part II) in the amount of $114, 411, a reduction of approx -imately $19,000 from the previous year's approved budget.

VI. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those provided for in the project outline submitted herewith and the individual contracts of several LIFEAT personnel.

PROJECT OUTLINE

PART I

1. Area of Operations

   This project is run from the Mexico City Station, and is concerned with targets located in Mexico City.

2. Purpose

   The purpose of this project is to determine Soviet and Satellite plans, activities and connections with other Communist elements through the use of technical surveillance. This purpose is in consonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico, dated 20 November 1959, Priority A, Objective one.

3. Background

   Project LIFEAT was originally approved on 3 October 1950 as a unilateral telephone tap operation. Actual initiation of operations was on 18 January 1951, and the project has run continuously from that date. The project was begun with the installation of one telephone tap, and has been expanded to the present average coverage of 18 lines.

   Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation completely independent from any liaison arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK staff and contract employees with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents.

   During the past nine years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than 64,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically, and has contributed materially to the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet and Satellite Bloc. In addition, Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in monitoring the activities of the American Communist community residing in Mexico City as well as activities of Cubans and exiles in Mexico.

d. No personnel were dropped from the project during the past project year.

10. Operational Clearances:

See section 9 above.

11. Cover

The cover of personnel employed in Project LIFEAT remains the same as noted in the last project renewal.

12. Contact and Communications

a. Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officers and the agents in this project. These contacts are made in a clandestine manner with varing patterns established for car pickups, foot contacts, and emergency meetings. Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings. When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, meetings are held at night. All movement in and out of the basehouses by the Case Officers and Principle Agents is done in cars ostensibly owned by agents, except in the case of LIVERY basehouse where the agents are too old to drive. One of the indigenou's agents is used to contact LIVERY base. Entrance to basehouses on foot by other than the residents of the house is

SECRET/KADOC


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 81

SECRET/KAPOK

-15-

made only in great emergencies.

b. Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents is kept to a minimum. Pre-arranged open code is used for phone conversations between Case Officers and agents.

c. Alternate and emergency signals have been arranged and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them.

d. These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project and function adequately from a security viewpoint. Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequently to decrease the possibility of discovery.

13. Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: Ideology and financial gain. A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the local police should discovery occur.

14. Training

Initial training of new personnel and refresher training for experienced agents is handled primarily by the outside case officer, David M. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintainance of equipment as well as emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents.

15. Equipment and Support

It is believed that much of the technical equipment upon which the continued successful collection of LIFEAT material depends will require replacement in the near future. The largest percentage of this equipment has been in nearly continuous operation from the initiation of the project in January 1951 and much of this equipment is no longer being manufactured. When present limited commercial stocks of replacement parts are exhausted, new units will be required for LIFEAT.

16. Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception in January 1951 and it is planned to continue it indefinitely.

PROJECT: LIFEAT

17. Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for FY 1961. All figures are U. S. dollars per year. ($1.00 dollar U.S. equals 12.50 Mexican pesos) Due to the continued rise in the cost of living, and especially to the expected increase in rental costs that is a chronic feature of the Mexico City scene, a moderate increase in some LIFEAT costs will be noted, even though the overall total requested is $16, 410 under that approved for FY 1960.

LIFEAT Project Renewal

RE 43-3 (CHECK X ONE)
MARKED FOR INDEXING

X NO INDEXING REQUIRED

INDEXING CAN BE JUDGED
BY QUALIFIED HQ DESK ONLY

**ACTION REQUIRED**:
Exploitation of LIFEAT leads

**REFERENCE(S)**:

1.  The LIFEAT Froject renewal submitted in MMA-12936 was approved on 16 July 1959 for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960 for a total of $123,830 for fiscal year 1950. The Station will note that monies requested for the support of Woodrow D. GABBOTT (PR) were subtracted from the request made by the Station for project funds. GAB OTT is supported by the BESHOOTH Project, an EE support project.

2.  The following staff comments were made when the iruject was submitted for approval:

a. "ROM has continued its rating of "C" on the disseminated positive information from the Froject, noting a slight increase in the disseminations, and commenting that it provides interesting information to customers on the nature and extent of Bloc commercial activities in Maxico, data useful in economic analyses, and reports on exile activities in Haxico.

b. KUTUBE/D recommended renewal of LIFEAT observing that the leads produced by the operation have been of operational value to LAURICLE activities conducted in Mexico City in the rast year. KUTUBE/D comments also that the Project has afforded and can be expected to continue to afford C's nrotection from time to time for activities of particular LAURICLE interest.

c. "KUTUDE/OPS has observed that Project IIFAT has been a most useful operational asset in the Mexico City Station for the past nine years, continuously providing KURARK with a window into important targets. KUTUBE/OPS requests that the next project renewal point out what agent recruitments by the Station have resulted from or been supported by the operational information secured by the project.

d. KUDESK commented that it well known that Mexico is being used by the RIS as a base for third country operations directed against the United States. Over a period of years LIFEAT has supplied valuable leads which have resulted in the identification of a large number of persons in clandestine contact with RIS officers; further investigation in several cases produced information which strongly indicated that the persons involved were actively assisting the RIS, while such information is, of itself, of interest and importance, cur responsibility in the CI field imposes the obligation to determine what these persons are doing for the RIS and this can be done only by recruiting, and doubling them. it is therefore suggested that LIFEAT leads and reports of investigations based on them be reviewed for the purpose of selecting a limited number of the more promising targets. Thereafter, Station assets including LIFAT should be used to obtain the operational data necessary to determine that a target is recruitable, and then a pitch should be made. Much time and effort will be required for such a program, but the potential rewards fully justify it, and the value of LIFEAT, as a CI asset, will be materially increased.

3.  Chief, KUTURE, in recomending the Project for renewal to Deputy Director, KUBARK, requested that at the time of the next Project renewal, the Division should review the relationshin and coordination of Project LIFTAT operations with those active and proposed under Project LIENVOI.

4. In addition to the formal comments cited above, during the process of obtaining approval for LIFEAT, the Project was subject to various and sundry criticisms in its present form. Therefore, Headquarters suggests that the Station bear this in mind and during the coming year make every effort to increase the operational value of this Project. If the LIENVOY Project is a success operationally and the leads are followed up and developed, WH Division anticipates that it will encounter difficulty in obtaining approval of a similar Project as large and as expensive as LIF-AT unless it is demonstrated to the complete satisfaction of Headquarters that the expense involved in the LIFEAT Project is justified and that the results of the exploitation of project developed leads prove useful in attaining the Station CS objectives. Among the comments received are:

a. Although the purpose and objectives of the project as stated in the FPO call for the collection of information, the operational intent is to make use of this information for an eventual recruitment of Sino-Soviet and Satellite diplomats and/or their contacts. It is realized that diplomats who are susceptible to defection or recruitment in place are few and far between and that the Station is always alert for such targets and is conscientious in their development. However, the Case Officer should keep in mind the more easily accessible and more vulnerable (though secondary) targets, i.e. the many contacts, friends, employees, etc. whose development could well lead to the primary targets. Headquarters feels it is this secondary category where more emphasis can be made. The recruitment in place of such individuals could be extremely valuable for the entire CI/CE program of the Station.

b. The lack of development and exploitation of leads from LIFEAT operations has been raised many times. In view of the limited reporting to Headquarters on the exploitation of operational leads, it has been difficult to state whether the leads are being followed up, who the targets are, and whether consideration is being given to recruitment approaches. Headquarters requests that in each monthly summary the Station supply more info under the section labeled "Exploitation of Leads". The statement "leads resulting from LIFEAT information are followed up by other Station assets" is meaningless without some explanation of the lead follow ups. Headquarters would like to know the names and some operational information concerning the persons who seem to be of most interest and who have been under investigation during the period covered by the monthly summary.

5. On page 6 of your covering memorandum on the FPO (HMMA-12936), you indicate that during the coming year the Station expects to expand its coverage to approximately 24 lines. Headquarters would like to suggest that consideration be given to limiting coverage to a number of lines which can be effectively exploited.

6. It is requested that Headquarters be informed in more detail in all cases where information obtained through LIFEAT has been used to support other important Station operations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

SUBJECT : Project LIFEAT Renewal

HEADQUARTERS CASE OFFICER:
Name: J. B. Brady
Room: 2114 arlington hall
Ext.: 2545 or 3152
Date: 15 June 1959

1. It is requested that the LIFEAT Project be renewed for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960 for a total of $135,415.00.

2. Attached is the Field's Project Review, together with a revised Project Outline, which clearly set forth the present status of the Project. It is believed that the activity described herein continues to justify the time and expense involved, and hence merits renewal for the forthcoming year.

3. In March 1959 we asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their evaluation of the usefulness of information on American Communists which originated from LIFEAT and whether they wished to continue receiving such information. On 2 April 1959, the Federal Bureau of Investigation replied that the information has been of value to them from intelligence and investigative viewpoints and they wish to continue receiving such information.

4. LIFEAT was the source of information concerning the plans of Albert HALPER and his wife for their trip to Europe and behind the Iron Curtain in May, June and July 1959. Through LIFEAT we learned that they were planning to try to contact Alfred Kaufman STARK and his wife Martha Dodd STERN and *Maurice* and Edith HALDEMAN, American Communists who fled behind the Iron Curtain during the past two years. Based on information made available through LIFEAT, Headquarters has made arrangements for the HALPERs to receive baggage searches and discreet surveillances at various points on their trip.

5. The Czech and Polish Desks in SR Division and the appropriate Desk in. SR Division were asked to comment on the value of LIFEAT to them. All desks agreed that LIFEAT was a very valuable source of general background information on the Soviet, Czech and Polish diplomats and often provided information which could be obtained through no other source. The Czech Desk commented that LIFEAT was of most value as a support asset to the Station, providing leads which might be developed into operational assets by the Station personnel. In May 1959 the Polish Desk sent

PROJECT REVIEW - LIFEAT

1. Product of the Project

The Soviet Embassy

a. Soviet Commercial Activities:

During the past year reports submitted from screening the LIFEAT/LIMERICK case of the two established Soviet commercial offices have provided a great amount of detail concerning Soviet efforts to sell in the Latin American market. Following is a list of a few of the reports submitted as a result of the intelligence gained from this source:

HA-3888, 27 Aug. 1958 - Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico

HIM-3852, 21 Jan. 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico

MEXI-3253, 2 Feb. 1959, Identity of Soviet Technician

HIM-4032, 18 Feb. 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico

HIM-4229, 18 Mar. 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico

HIM-4279, 10 Apr. 1959, Commercial Contact of USSR and Poland in Mexico

HIM-4277, 17 Apr. 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico.

b. Soviet Diplomatic Activities:

This project has provided coverage and details of some of the diplomatic activities of the Soviets in Mexico. It has served to show the relationships maintained, culturally, socially and diplomatically between the Soviets and the members of the Satellite establishments in Mexico.

c. Soviet Cultural Activities:

Information produced by LIFEAT has given details of Soviet activities in connection with cultural activities. Examples of such reports are:

HMF-A-11594, 26 Nov. 1958, Soviet Representative at World Film Festival held in Mexico City, 10-28 Oct. 1958 - Ivan A. PYRYEV

HMF-A-12225, 25 Feb. 1959, Soviet participants in Pablo CASALS International Competition Held in Jalapa 18 Jan. - 1 Feb. 1959

HMF-4004, 2 Feb. 1959, Pablo CASALS Competition Participants

MEXI-3634, 2 Apr. 1959, Contact with Chinese Ballet Troupe

d. Movement of Soviet officials;

Through LIFEAT coverage a roster of Soviet personnel currently in Mexico has been maintained by Station Mexico. This has been the primary source of such information. LIFEAT has enabled the station to determine in advance when departures can be expected and has also been a factor in determining job assignments and replacements for departing personnel.

e. Soviet Embassy Contacts:

Contact reports of the Soviets are compiled and provided for Headquarters as necessary. These reports are of considerable operational value in identifying regular and/or occasional local and foreign contacts of the Soviets. Following are examples of this type of coverage:

HMF-A-12295, 4 Mar. 1959, Soviet Contacts in Mexico - Haile ATSBEHA, Ethiopian

HMF-A-11838, 7 Jan. 1959- Orville M. MULLIKIN

f. Personality Reports on Soviet officials;

LIFEAT has provided the Station with the most productive source of information concerning the private and official lives of the Soviets assigned to Mexico. These reports have been submitted on individuals, e.g., -11163; 5 Nov. 1958, Activities of revgeniy M. POPOV, Third Secretary, Soviet Embassy, Mexico City, June 1957 - October 1958; HM-A-11569, 10 Dec. 1958, Boris G. PUTILIN, Employee, Military Attache office, Mexico City; HM-A-12755, 30 April 1959, Boris M. STRELTSOV, and F10-A-12000, 28 Jan. 1959, Aleksandr M. BROVKIN.

g. Goods and Services;

Information on Goods and Services obtained from LIFEAT was used in Project LIKESA.

H. Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy;

LIFEAT material which does not fall into any one category but which deals with the Soviets and their associates and related activities has been reported as necessary.

The Czech Legation

The information obtained on the Czech legation during the period under review is essentially the same as that from the Soviet Embassy. Representative of the reports submitted from this information are the following personnel reports;

НЫМ-А-12069, 4 Feb. 1959, Alois LICEK

HL-A-12067, 4 Feb. 1959, Jaroslav KREJZA

HO-A-12091, 4 Feb. 1959, Bedrich PISTORA and

HI-A-12128, 11 Feb. 1959, Oldrich SPORCR.

The Polish Legation

Information on this installation parallels that on the Czech and Soviet installations. The largest amount of information concerning


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 100

HID-A-12936
KAPOK-1631
Page 4

the polish Legation has been procured from LIFEAT. Following are examples of reports from this source;

HMM-A-12420, 18 Mar. 1959, Contacts of Aleksandr BEKIER, Polish Counselor

HMM-A-10883, 20 Aug. 1958, Mieczyslaw WLODAREK, Polish Minister

HMM-A-12376, 11 Mar. 1959, Antonio O. MARCEYNSKY

HMM-A-12393, 11 Mar. 1959, polish Legation publication.

Mexican Communist Party and Communist Fronts

A significant amount of information concerning the Communist party in Mexico and the Communist front organizations in Mexico was obtained from LIFEAT. Information from LIFEAT has been invaluable in supplementing agent coverage of the front-organizations which exist here. Examples of this type reporting include;

HMM-A-11411, The Narciso BASSOLS Family and polish Legation

HMM-A-11412, 5 Nov. 1958, Travel of Narciso BASSOLS.

American Communists in Mexico

Most of these targets have been covered at the request of ODEVY and the production has been partially processed by them. A total of 572 reels was provided them for processing during a 10-month period ending 30 April 1959. Samples of the reporting done from this source include;

HMM-A-12719, 24 April 1959, Noah and Anna SEBORER

HMM-A-12013, 28 Jan. 1959, Anna and Noah SEBORER

HMM-A-12460, 20 Mar. 1959, Albert MALTZ

HMM-A-11851, 7 Jan. 1959, Albert MALTZ.

Foreign Dissident Groups in Mexico

LIFEAT provided partial coverage of Cuban exile groups and gave current information on the status of the "26 July Movement" prior to its overthrow of the BATISTA government in Cuba and has continued to

provide information on the current status of the Cubang in Mexico.

LAURICIE Information

LIFEAT has contributed materially to several matters having
LAURICLE interest.

Counter-Intelligence Imformation

CI/CE matters constitute a major portion of the lexico City
Stationis priority cojectives. Project LIFEAT has contributed to
the attainment of these cojectives. The two BGMORNING installations
have provided valuable information for the responsible Case Officer
on the matters involved therein.

Conclusion

The Mexico City station believes that the product of the LIFEAT
Project measured against the expenditure of KUBARK assets in terms
of personnel, time, security risks and funds well justifies its
renewal. The information produced by this operation has materially
contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related
Mission Directive.

2. Progress of the Operation

Definite progress has been made in reporting on the objectives of the
LIFEAT Project. However, since LIFEAT objectives are of a continuing nature
and are not designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the
porcentage of coverage on each objective. A general indication of the
coverage can be derived when it is realized that some 10,000 pages of raw
text in 10 months are the direct result of the operation from which the
statistics cited above were derived Except for a period in July and
August 1958, following the termination of members of the James 0. AYCALL
family, LIFEAT has been in daily operation with some 12-16 lines being
covered. These may be broken dom as follows;

Soviot Embassy 5 lines
Czech Legation 2 lines(moved during this period and only in
operation for approximately 2 months)
Polish Legation 3 lines (third installed in April 1959)
American Communists 3 lines
Remainder 5 lines.

3. Planning for the Future

During the coming year station capabilities will be expanded to permit monitoring of approximately 24 lines. Basic coverage of Soviet, Czech and Polish activities will be continued to the maximum extent possible and assets and capabilities will be maintained for exploiting important targets of opportunity. At the present time and with the new system effected for LIFEAT lines, Station believes that 24 will be the maximum number of lines which can be properly handled and handled securely by the personnel currently available for LIFEAT.

4. Performance of Agents

In general the performance of the LIFEAT agents has been good and secure during the past year. The personnel from the AYCALL group were terminated during this period and compartmentation has been employed in the re-assignment of tasks among LIFEAT chain. In view of the high degree of security necessary for the personnel involved in this operation, it is planned to screen very carefully any possible candidates before they are approached for use in this operation after prior approval has been procured from Headquarters for an approach.

5. Expenditures during period under Review

Approval was granted for the period under review, 1 July 1958 - 30 June 1959 to spend $159,590.00. The proposed LIFAT budget for FY 1960 is contained in the attached Field Project Outline Part II.

6. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those provided for in the outline and the individual contracts of several LIFKAT personnel.

PROJECT OUTLINE

PROJECT: LIFEAT

PART I

1. Area of Operations

This project is run from the Mexico City Station. It is concerned with targets located in Mexico City.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to determine Sino-Soviet and Satellite plans, activities and connections with other Communist elements through the use of technical surveillance. This purpose is in consonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico, Priority A, Objective one.

3. Background

Project LIFEAT was initially approved on 3 October 1950. Actual operations began 18 January 1951 and have run continuously since that time. The LIFEAT Project was begun with the installation of one telephone tap and has been exparded since that time to where the present coverage averages 18 lines.

Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation. It is completely independent from any liaison arrangement and is staffed by KUBARK staff and contract employees with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents.

During the past eight years Project LIFEAT has produced more than 55,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically and has contributed materially to the intelligonce gathering activities connected with the Sino-Soviet and Satellite Bloc. In addition, Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in monitoring the activities of Amricans residing in Mexico City in which ODENVY has major interest.

11. Cover

Woodrow D. GABBOT enjoys fictional cover as Researcher for a POPKIME Research Council.

Other cover remains the same as that submitted in HM-A-7063 except for David M. WILSTED who is engaged in insurance business since he has procured his "Immigrado" status.

12. Contact and Communications

a. Daily contact and communications between the Case Officer and the agents and undercover personnel in this Project is maintained in a clandestine manner. Various patterns have been established by which the agents and case officers follow pre-arranged signals for meetings. When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, pre-arranged

meetings are held at night. All movement in and out of bases by the Case officers and Principal Agents is done in cars ostensibly owned by agents except in the case of LIVERY where agents are too old to drive. One of the indigenous agents is used to contact LIVERY base. Entrance to bases on foot is made only in great emergencies.

b. Telephone contact concerning the Project and with agents is kept to a minimum and code is used for phone conversations between Case Officers and agents.

c. Alternate and emergency signals have been arranged.

d. In general these systems of contact and communication appear to be suitable for the Project and function adequately from a security viewpoint. Locations and times of meetings are changed frequently to prevent discovery.

13. Control and Motivation

Control and motivation seem to be based on two factors primarily: ideological and monetary. A third controlling factor would be fear of reprisal from local police should discovery occur.

14. Equipment and Support

It is believed probable that a great deal of replacement equipment will be required by the Project during FY 1960 since much of the current equipment installed and working has been in use for the length of the project and since this equipment is no longer being manufactured, replacement parts will be unobtainable soon and new units will be required.

15. Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception in January 1951 and it is planned to continue it indefinitely.

DATE: 19 September 1958

1.  Project LIF AT was renewed on 9 September 1958 for the period 1 July 1958 through 30 June 1959 for a total of $159,590.

2.  KUTUBE/OPS recommended that the Station make an increased effort to reduce the amount of paper work for the case officer to allow his sufficient time to go beyond the surveillance-investigative phase of handling the many operational leads and be in a position for more agent recruitment efforts. KUTUBE suggested that several of the lines which are of marginal value be deactivated, temporarily at least, to assist in this effort.

3.  The project review forwarded with HMMA-10198 was submitted for approval as prepared in the field with the exception of Part II which had to be retyped in view of the number of changes and additions required. The only changes made in the Project review - LIFEAT section was the deletion of several examples of reports originating from several LIF-AT sources. These deletions (such as the last five examples of reports on Soviet Commercial Activities) were made because the reports did not originate with LIFEAT eventhough they did concern the Subject being discussed. Part I of the Project Outline excerpts submitted by the field was also submitted for approval-the only change made was the omission of the field's request for a change in paragraph 6 of the Project Outline on Objectives. Headquarters did not think subparagraph "f" should be deleted.

4.  Attached for our information and records is a complete copy of the Renewal Request. It is requested that you review the memorandum, "WH Division's Comments on the LIFEAT Project Renewal", and the new Part II, paying particular attention to the personnel included therein. This request is being made in view of the conflicting information Headquarters received from the Station Case Officer who was on TDY in Headquarters (DIR 31900-16 July 1958) and from the field (MEXI-2031) in reply to HMW-6555.

SUBJECT: Project LIFTAT/LIMETICK

REFERENCE: Memorandum for Chief, SR from Chief, WH/III dated 2 July 1958

According to a telephone call from Herb Manell of SR/10 on 23 July 1958 SR Division believes that information produced by Project LIFTAT on the RIS and the Soviets is most valuable. He stated that this project is the chief source of information other than physical surveillance.

The only recommendation that SR Division would make is that the field be more selective in the reporting that is transmitted to Headquarters. (This recommendation has already been passed to the field)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/III

SUBJECT: LITMUS Phase of LIFEAT Project

REFERENCE: WH/III Memorandum dated 2 July 1958

1. Due to a period of dormancy, the LITMUS phase of the LIFEAT Project has furnished a relatively small amount of reporting, during the past year, concerning BEDOX officials and their activities in Mexico. While small in quantity, the information furnished has been of considerable operational value because of the nature of the operation and the fact that it serves as a major source of data on the BEDOX target. The LITMUS operation has furnished accurate travel data, information on the function and scope of activity engaged in by the BEDOX personalities we are interested in and has helped us determine the number of contacts the BEDOX installation maintains with the local citizenry in the course of its activities. In the last case, the LITMUS operation has linked a local citizen, long suspected of Soviet Bloc intelligence activity, with one known and one suspected BEDOX intelligence officer serving under diplomatic cover in Mexico. This local citizen is now the subject of an extensive effort to prove his Soviet Bloc intelligence role and to determine the extent of his activity. Finally, the LITMUS operation has begun to furnish valuable operational data on a BEDOX personality who has recently arrived to assume a consular post. This particular BEDOX official was recommended to the field as a target of interest because of his past intelligence background. We feel confident that the LITMUS operation will aid considerably in our effort to monitor the activities of this individual.

2. Now that the LITMUS phase of the LIFEAT operation has, once again, begun to function, we believe that the information obtained therefrom will show a steady increase in operational value during the coming year.

Before its suspension in January 1958, the LIVERY phase of Project LIFEAT provided biographic data on the members of the Czech Legation in Mexico City which ER/C found useful in the evaluation of these individuals as possible targets. If the LIVERY phase of the project is resumed, it is anticipated that it would continue to provide similarly useful information. For this reason ER/C is interested in seeing Project LIFEAT renewed.

## WH Division Comments on LIFEAT Project Renewal

1.  At the end of January 1958, telephone linemen discovered our tap on the LIVERY installation leading into one of our base houses. As a result of this all LIFEAT operations were suspended as of 31 January and 1 February 1958 pending the outcome of what appeared to be an involved investigation by the Mexican Telephone Company. The EIWATER's disclosed that the telephone company was not investigating the situation and the operation was secure.

The first line from the BIMKICK group was put in again on 17 March 1958. During the same month coverage of one American Communist was also re-stated.

As of the end of April, the Station had coverage on the following lines:

3 LIRICK, 1 LITOSPHERE, 1 LITMIS, 1 American Communist, 1 Target of Opportunity, and 1 Mexican Soviet Contact. Since the partial re-instatement of LIFEAT coverage there has been no indication that suspicion of the activity exists on the part of the Mexican Telephone Company or security services. In order to provide more secure LIFEAT coverage, a new system of installation of technical surveillance is now in effect. This system prohibits the opposition from detecting any LIFEAT lines with a voltage meter.

2. The following new personnel have been included in this Project renewal requests:

a.  LISTY (Leona C. GANDARA - ps), a U. S. citizen and wife of a Staff Agent, was issued CSA on 24 June 1958 as a LIFEAT processor. The field is preparing a contract for her. (C-61557)

b. LIMANU-1 (Janet N. DELACUR - ps), a U. S. citizen, was issued an Operational Approval on 31 January 1958 for use as a LIFEAT processor. She is motivated by patriotic loyalty. Financial remuneration will provide additional control. The field has been requested to prepare a formal contract for her. (C-393)

c. LIVEWATER-6 is an employee of the Mexican Telephone Company and is LIMEWATER's assistant. His motivation at this time is believed to be financial. A POA was granted LIVEWATER-6 on 14 May 1958. An Operational Approval has been requested. (C-70322)

d. LIQUATION-1, wife of LICCATION-1, occupies a basehouse with her husband. She received an OA on 2 October 1957. She will receive no remuneration.

3. LIMESTONE-9, LIMESTONE-10, LEUCATION-2, LIPSTICK-35, LIPSTICK-37 and LIMITATION-7 are still active under Project LIFEAT. They receive no remuneration. Therefore, their names do not appear on the list of LIFEAT agents on the attached Part II of the Project Outline.

# Product of the Project

## The Soviet Embassy

### Soviet Commercial Activities:

During the past year reports submitted from screening the traffic of the two established Soviet Commercial Offices in Mexico have provided a great amount of detail concerning Soviet efforts to sell in the Latin American market, both heavy industrial merchandise and movies and literature. Knowledge of their methods of transshipping and attempts at concealment of point of origin of products has been gleaned from this take. As a result of this knowledge, reports on the firms with whom they are doing business have been procured and provided for background information. Following are a list of the reports submitted as a result of intelligence procured from this source:

*   IRM-3085 Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico
*   IRM-3165, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico
*   IRM-3286 Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico, December 1957
*   IRM-3253 - Soviet Commercial Contacto in Mexico-Michoacana del Deslconio, S. de R.L.
*   IRM-3064 Soviet Comercial Contacto in Mexico - Serviolo Agricola, S.A.
*   IRM 3139 Anilinas y Productos Quimicos S. de R.L.
*   IRM-3404 Imports into Mexico from Soviet Union
*   CIA-9529 American Cyanid Co., Valco Chemical Division

### Soviet Diplomatic Activities:

This project has provided coverage and details of some of the diplomatic activities of the Soviets in Mexico. It has served to show the relationships maintained, culturally, socially and diplomatically, between the Soviets and the members of the Satellite establishments in Mexico.

*   IRM-3215, Soviet Attendance at Yugoslav Reception
*   IRM-3351 - Reception at Soviet Embassy.
*   IRM-2992 - Diplomatic Activities of Soviet Embassy, Mexico City.
*   IRM-2649 - Diplomatic Activities of Soviet Embassy, Mexico City

### Soviet Cultural Activities:

Information produced by LIFEAT has given details of Soviet activities in connection with publications, cultural institutes, and related activities. Examples of such reports are:

*   IRM-2670 - Soviet Embassy Reception for Mexican Musicians
*   IRM-2047 - Cultural & Propaganda Activities of Soviet Embassy
*   IRM-3080, Cultural & Propaganda Activities of Soviet Embassy

d. Soviet Military Activities:

Monthly reports on the activities of Soriot litary persamel, knowledge of which vas olitained from LIPAT, and their contacts in military circles in Maxico have proved to be of especial interest to WICK service attaches in Maxtoo.

e. Movements of Soviet Officials:

Through LIFEAT coverage a roster of Soviet personnel presently in Maxico has been maintained by Station Nexico. This has been the primary source of such Inforaation. LIFEAT has enabled the Station to determine in advance when departures can be expected for the Soviets, prior to their permanent departure, normally stock up on clothing and occasionally other items throught to be in short supply in the USSR.

f. Soviet Embassy Contacts:

Contacts reports of the Soviets are compiled and provided İbadquarters es necessary. These reports are of considerable operation value in identifying local and foreign Communists with whom the Soviets are in regular contact. Following ere examples of this type of coverage:

121-2841- MONTES Y ER'DLEY (fon)
1881-3199 - Farciso BASOCLS Contacte with the Soviet Embassy.

g. Personality Reports on Soviet Officials:

LIFEAT has provided the Station with the most productive source of infor- mation concerning the private and official lives of the Soviets assigned hess. These reports have been submitted on dindividuals, e.g. H84-1-9504, Aleksey B. CIERKASOV, and also under one cover, 11-A-985%, January 1958 Report of Personnel Activities.

h. Goods and Services:

Periodic reports of the persons and institutions knom to be providing goods and services to the Soviet Dabassy have been of considerable value in developing and mounting & LAURICLE operation. Information of this type has also been of con siderable value to the Station in the LIMESA operation.

i. Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy:

LIFEAT material which does not fall into my one category but which deals with the Soviets and their associates and related activities has been reported os necessary

The Czech Legation

The information obtained on the Czech Legation during the period under reviov is essentially the same as that from the Soviet Embassy. To avoid repetition, only a brief summary of the information submitted will be given here.

KAPOX-1401

a. Czech Personnel Reports:

HMI-3169, Activities of *denek KITA* and EI1-3236, *Travel of Czech* Legation personnel, are examples of the type of reports made from the personality and activity inform acquired from LIFEAT coverage of his installation. BII-3262, *Cocktail Party at Czech Residence*, is any example of the reports from this source on diplomatic activities of this installation.

b. Spot Reports on Czech Legation Activities:

Reports on a spot basis which were of interest included:

Polish Legation

Information on this installation closely parallels that obtained on the Czech Legation and the Soviet installations. The largest amount of information concerning the Polish installation has been procured from LIFEAT. An example of reports from this source is IFF-3161, Leon KILARSKI, Polish Commercial Attache. Another is 1844-3130, Suspicious Contact of Edward RUDSKI, Josef Isaak GANSCHAFT.

Mexican Communist Party and Communist Fronts

A significant amount of information concerning the Communist Party in Mexico and the Communist front organizations in Mexico was obtained from LIFEAT. Information from LIFEAT has been invaluable in supplementing agent coverage of the front- organizations which exist here. Examples of this type of reporting are as follows:

IHH-3193 - Narciso BASSOLS and Family
1844-3176 - Travel of Pro-Communists

American Communists in Mexico:

One of the most extensive and productive coverages maintained through LIFEAT during this past year was directed against American Communists in Mexico. Hast of these targets have been covered at the request of ODERNY and the production has been partially processed by them for the Justification of one of their dots in their local establishment. A total of jel reels have been the result of the coverage since 1 July 1957 until 25 April 1958.

Foreign Communists in Mexico and Mexican Communists:

LIFEAT continued to provide partial coverage of Eduardo MACHADO Morales, Venezuelan Communist, until the time of his departure for return to Venezuela. LIFEAT also provided some 50 reels of coverage on Diego RIVERA, well-known Communist Mexican painter, until his dealth in November 1957. From this coverage it was determined that RIVERA was sufficiently concerned over the departure of the former Soviet Cultural Attache, Yuriy PAPOROV, that he arose from his sick bed in order to make the trip to Verecrus by car so insure that PAPOROV's departure was without incident.

## LA/RIC/LZ Information:

LIFEAR has contributed materially to several matters having LA/RIC/LZ interest.

## Counter Intelligence Information:

S/CI matters constitute a major portion of the Mexico City Station's priority objectives. Project LI/FEAT has contributed more leads and general information on the Soviet aspect of this subject then all other Station sources. A few representative samples of this type of information are the following:

HR-A-9121, Suspicious Soviet Contact
HRA-9135- Sergio KIREY Rassvetaet
HRA-8552, Vladimir SOKOLOV; Col. Jesus de LEXI Toral, 6 November 1957
LOHAYPOHL

## Jewish Communist Activities:

Coverage of the Jewish Communist leader, Samuel MAGIDIH Magidin, has confirmed the continuing decline of the local Jewish Communist movement. It has also provided the Station with information on those former members who continue to meet at irregular intervals on an informal basis.

## Conclusion:

The Mexico City Station believes that the produce of the LI/FEAT Project measured against the expenditure of KUBARK ascote in terms of personnel, time, security risks and funds well justifies its removal. The information produced by this operation has materially contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

## 2. Progress of the Operation:

Definite progress has been made in reporting on the objectives of the LI/PEAT Project. However, since LI/VSAT objectives are of a continuing nature and are not designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the percentage of coverage on each objective. A general indication of the coverage can be derived when it is realized that some 15,000 pages of raw text are the direct result of the operation from which the statistics cited above were derived. Except for a period from 1 February - 11 April 1958 LI/VSAT has been in daily operation with some 18 to 23 lines being covered. Generally, these may be broken down as follows:

Soviet Embassy - 7 lines

Czech Legation - 2 lines

Polish Legation - 2 lines

American Communists - 5 lines

Remainder - 7 lines

IUOC-1401

3. Planning for the Future

During the coming year station capabilities will be expanded to permit greater flexibility of approximately 20 lines. Basic coverage of Soviet, Czech and Polish activities will be continued to the maximum extent possible and assets and capabilities will be maintained for exploiting 1 recent targets of opportunity. At the present, the mechanism being used for LIFAAT. It is understood, Station believes that 28 will be the maximum number of lines which can be handled properly and securely by the personal resources and assets here for LIFAAT.

4. Maintenance of Agents

In general the performance of the LIFAAT agents has been good and secure during the past year. It is hoped that within the coming year the remainder of the ICALL group will be securely and permanently removed from the project and replaced by well-indoctrinated personnel. In view of the high degree of security necessary for the personnel involved in this operation, it is planned to screen very carefully any possible candidates before they are approached for use in this operation after prior approval for an approach has been secured from Headquarters.

Additional comments concerning the protection, security and cover of individual agents will be found in the attached commitment to the field outline which was submitted with RC-A-5708.

5. Expenditures During Period under Review

Approval was granted for the period under review, 1 July 1957 - 30 June 1958, to expend $196,047. The proposed LIFAAT budget for FY 1959 is contained in the attached field project outline Part II.

6. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those provided for in the outline and the individual commitments of several LIFAAT personnel.

PROJECT OUTLIDES
(Excerpts)

## 3. Background

Project LIFEAT was initially approved 5 October 1950. Actual operations began on 10 January 1951 and have run almost continuously since that time. The LIFEAT operation was begun with the installation of one telephone tap and has since expanded to an average of 23 telephone lines.

Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation. It is completely independent from any liaison arrangement and it is staffed by KUBARK personnel, both staff and contract, together with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents.

During the time of its operation Project LIFEAT has produced more than 50,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically and has contributed materially to the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Otto Soviet bloc. In addition, Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in monitoring the activities of Americans residing in Mexico City in which ODENVY has an interest and also has, at the direction of Headquarters, installed special taps on targets of opportunity.

e. Maintain LIFEAT capabilities for mounting operations against targets of opportunity.

f. Maintain supervision over basehouses and training of the personnel therein.

9. Personnel

The following are changes from FY 1958 for FY 1959:

Daniel K. BROMUND arrived at Station Mexico to assume duties as translator of LIFEAT/LIMUS material and relief translator on LIFT/LDERICK.

10. Equipment and Support

It is considered essential that new equipment be provided for LIFEAT for FY 1959 in view of the fact that such of the equipment in current use has been steadily in operation since the inception of the project in 1951. Also, in view of expected expansion of the project and the possibilities of live monitoring, additional equipment in first-class condition will be necessary. A backlog of 10 new recorders and 300 reels along with repair parts is considered a minimum for efficient continuance of the project.

(Due to recent increases in the cost of living, it is expected that an over-all rate of 10% will be made to agents during FY 1959. In April 1958 a new import tax of 40-60% was imposed by the government with the resultant increase in commodities in general use. Adjustments will be made in peso amounts should the devaluation of the peso occur during this FY.

# DISPATCH

TO : Chief of Station, Mexico City

FROM: Chief, MED

SUBJECT: LIFEAT Project Renewal

ACTION REQUIRED: Cable Reply, Submit Agent Termination Reports

REFERENCE(S): HDJA-10198

It is requested that you reply by cable to the following questions so that the request for renewal of the LIFEAT Project can be submitted.

1. Approval to insert the following persons at the salaries indicated. Please correct salaries listed below if they are wrong.

LIEDDI - $4,000
LIMENU/1 - $4,000
Nadine M. CHAROUSRK - $3,640

2. The following have been cleared for use under LIFEAT since the last Project renewal. Since they were not mentioned in your request for renewal, have they been activated under Project LIFEAT and should they be included in our request for renewal? Are any funds required to cover their use?

LIQUATION/4
Subject of HHM-5906

3. The following agents were included under the LIFEAT Project renewal of last year. Since none of them receive pay their names did not appear on Part II of the Project Outline attached to reference. Therefore, Headquarters does not know whether they are still active under the Project. In our request for renewal we must indicate the names of all agents who have been dropped from the project during the past project year and the present use being made of each agent. Please indicate those agents who are no longer under Project LIFEAT and what use is being made of each. If they are not active, please submit agent service records on them. If they are being used for other work please submit new PRQ II's and requests to amend their Operational Approvals. Unless advised to the contrary, Headquarters will assume the following are still active under Project LIFEAT.

LIMESTONE-9
LIMESTONE-10
LIQUATION-2

LIPSTICK-35
LIPSTICK-37
LIMITATION-7

4. The covering dispatch to your request for LIFEAT Project renewal stated that LICOOL and the provision for Harvey C. MULFORD had been removed from LIFEAT. Since MULFORD is covered by Project MKCHARITY, Headquarters assumes you intend to carry out LICOOL operations under Project MKCHARITY. In view of the fact Project MKCHARITY is a KURIOT Project which supports KURIOT Staff Agents Harvey C. MULFORD and Alice N. HADZKLLI and provides for technical equipment and technical services, Headquarters does not believe LICOOL belongs under MKCHARITY. If LICOOL were included under MKCHARITY, the latter project would have to be amended to provide for such operational activity and to provide funds for base houses, base house-keepers, and processors of LICOOL take.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

## SECRET

## RT-W-6555

PRIORITY

We believe LICOOL is best placed under LIF AT,where it has been included in the past. The only alternative would be a new project to cover LICOOL operations. Therefore, it is requested that you comment by cable on the above by indicating a new Project Outline will be forthcoming, or requesting us to include LICOOL in our LIFEAT Project Renewal. If the latter is the case, please indicate the number of LICOOL base houses, rent per year for each, names and salary of any LICOOL base housekeepers and processors not already included in your request for LIF AT Project Renewal request, and any additional expenses which should be included. Also indicate how many LICOOL operations are active at the present in addition to the one proposed in LI-1877, dated 30 June 1958.

5. With reference to LI-1816 (20 June 1958), Headquarters plans to leave LIFSTONE'S 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 in the LIFEAT Project when it is submitted for renewal, we will indicate that LIFSTONE'S 1, 2 and 7 are not active under the Project but funds for continued payments to them are included because of security reasons emanating from their past use and knowledge acquired under Project LIFEAT. If it is decided to terminate any or all of them the money can be used for that purpose.

PROJECT REVIEW - LIFEAT

1. Product of the Project
   The Soviet Embassy-

a. Soviet Commercial Activities:

During the past year reports submitted from screening the traffic of the two established Soviet Commercial Offices in Mexico have provided a great amount of detail concerning Soviet efforts to sell in the Latin Ameri can market, both heavy industrial merchandise and movies and literature. Knowledge of their methods of transshipping and attempts at concealment of point of origin of products has been gleaned from this take. As a result of this knowledge, reports on the firms with whom they are doing business have been procured and provided for background information. Following are a list of the reports submitted as a result of intelligence procured from this source:

#mm-2033 Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico
HMM-3165, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico
HMM-3286- Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico, December 1957
1801-3253-6ovies Commercial Contacto in Horteo Menoacana dol
Occidente, Gr de R.L.
HM-3264-Goviet Commercial Contacte in Mexico - Servicio Agricola, &.A.
1801-3139-Anilinas y Productos Quimicos S. de RE
HMM-3404 - Importe inte Mexico from Soviet Union
HMM-A-9519-American Cyanid Co, Calco Chemical Division

b. Soviet Diplomatic Activities:

This project has provided coverage and details of some of the diplomatic activities of the Soviets in Mexico. It has served to show the relationships maintained, culturally, socially and diplomatically, between the Soviets and the members of the Satellite establishments in Mexico.

HMM-3215, Soviet Attendance at Yugoslav Reception
HMM-3351- Reception at Sovièt Embassy.
HMM-2992- Diplomatic Activities of Soviet Embassy, Mexico City
HMM-2849- Diplomatic Activities of Soviet Embassy, Mexico City

c. Soviet Cultural Activities:

Informatim produced by LIFEAThas given details of Soviet activities in connection with publications, cultural institutes, and related activities. Examples of such reports are:

HMM-2870 - Soviet Embassy Reception for Mexican Musicians
HMM-2847- Cultural & Propaganda Activities of Soviet Embassy
HMM-3080, Cultural & Propaganda Activities of. Soviet Embassy

# Project Review

Attachment to EN-A-10198
KAPOK-1401

d. Soviet Military Activities:

Monthly reports on the activities of Soviet military personnel, knowledge of which was obtained from LIFEAT, and their contacts in military circles in Mexico have proved to be of especial interest to ODYOKE service attaches in Mexico.

e. Movements of Soviet Officials:

Through LIFEAT coverage a roster of Soviet personnel presently in Mexico has been maintained by Station Mexico. This has been the primary source of such information. LIFEAT has enabled the Station to determine in advance when departures can be expected for the Soviets, prior to their permanent departure, normally stock up on clothing and occasionally other items throught to be in short supply in the USSR.

f. Soviet Embassy Contacts:

Contact reports of the Soviets are compiled and provided Headquarters as necessary. These reports are of considerable operation value in identifying local and foreign Communists with whom the Soviets are in regular contact. Following are examples of this type of coverage:

HMM-2841- MONTES Y BRADLEY (fnu)
HMM-3199 - Narciso BASSOLS Contacts with the Soviet Enbassy.

g. Personality Reports on Soviet Officials:

ILFEAT has provided the Station with the most productive source of infor mation concerning the private and official lives of the Soviets assigned here. These reports have been submitted on individuals, e.g. HMM-A-9504, Aleksey N. CHERKASOV, and also under one cover, HMM-A-9856, January 1958 Report of Personnel Activities.

h. Goods and Services:

Periodic reports of the persons and institutions known to be providing goods and services to the Soviet Embassy have been of considerable value in developing and mounting a LAURICLS operation. Information of this type has also been of con- siderable value to the Station in the LIMESA operation.

i. Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy:

LIFEAT material which does not fall into any one category but which deals with the Soviets and their associates and related activities has been reported as necessary

The Czech Legation

The information obtained on the Czech Legation during the period under review is essentially the same as that from the Soviet Embassy. To avoid repetition, only a brief smmary of the information submitted will be be given here.

КАРОК-1401

## Czech Personnel Reports:

HMM-3164, Activities of Edenek KVITA and HMM-3238, Travel of Croch Legation personnel, are examples of the type of reports made f from the personality and activity information acquired from LIFAAT coverage of this installation. HM14-3262, Cocktail Party at Czech Residence, is an example of the reports this source on diplomatic activities of this installation.

## Spot Reports on Czech Legation Activities:

Reports on a spot basis which were of interest included:

1801-3054, Coccoh Concern over Possible Expulsion from Nontoo.

![LaoF LIEN LEGATION MURAL CPP.C JALDA EXPOST CNV A DE image]

## Polish Legation

Information on this installation closely paralles that obtained on the Czech Legation and the Soviet installations. The largest amount of information concern- ing the Polish installation has been procured from LIFEAT. An example of reports from this source is HMM-3161, Leon KILARSKI, Polish Commercial Attache. Another is HMM-3130, Suspicious Contact of Edward RUDSKI, Josef Isaak GENSCHAFT.

## Mexican Communist Farty and Communist Fronts

A significant amount of information concerning the Communist Party in Mexico and the Communist front organizations in Mexico vas obtained from LIFEAT. Informa- tion from LIFEAT has been invaluable in supplementing agert coverage of the front- organizations which exist here. Examples of this type of reporting are as follows:

HMM-3193- Narciso BASSOLS and Family;
HMM-3176 - Travel of Pro-Communists

## American Communists in Mexico:

One of the most extensive and productive coverages maintained through LIFEAT during this past year was directed against American Communists in Mexico. Most of these targets have been covered at the request of ODENVY and the production has been partially processed by them for the justification of one of their slots in their local establishment. A total of 381 reels have been the result of the coverage since 1 July 1957 until 25 April 1958.

## Foreign Communists in Mexico and Mexican Communists:

LIFEAT continued to provide partial coverage of Eduardo MACHADO Morales, Venezuelan Communist, until the time of his departure for return to Venezuela. LIFEAT also provided some 50 reels of coverage on Diego RIVERA, well-known Communist Mexican painter, until his death in November 1957. From this coverage it was determined that RIVERA was sufficiently concerned over the departure of the former Soviet Cultural Attache, Yuriy PAPOROV, that he arose from his sick bed in order to make the trip to Veracruz by car to insure that FAFGROW's departure was without incident.

КАГОК-1401

## LAURICLE Information:

LIFEAT has contributed materially to several matters having LAURICLE interest.

## Counter Intelligence Information:

CI/CE matters constitute a major portion of the Mexico City Station's priority objectives. Project LIFEAT has contributed more leads and general information on the Soviet aspect of this subject than all other Station sources. A few representative samples of this type of information are the following:

*   HM-A-9121, Suspicious Soviet Contact
*   HM-A-9135 - Sergio KIREEV Rassvetaef
*   HMM-A-8552, Vladimir SOKOLOV; Col. Jesus de LEON Toral, 6 November 1957
*   LCMAYPOWL

## Jewish Communist Activities:

Coverage of the Jewish Communist leader, Samuel MAGIDIN Magidin, has confirmed the continuing decline of the local Jewish Communist movement. It has also provided the Station with information on those former members who continue to meet at irregular intervals on an informal basis.

## Conclusion:

The Mexico City Station believes that the produce of the LIFEAT Project measured against the expenditure of KUBARK assets in terms of personnel, time, security risks and funds well justifies its renewal. The information produced by this operation has materially contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

2.  Progress of the Operation -

Definite progress has been made in reporting on the objectives of the LIFEAT Project. However, since LIFEAT objectives are of a continuing rature and are not designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the percentage of coverage on each objective. A general indication of the coverage can be derived when it is realized that some 15,000 pages of raw text are the direct result of the operation from which the statistics cited above were derived. Except for a period from 1 February - 11 April 1958 LIFEAT has been in daily operation with some 18 to 23 lines being covered. Generally, these may be broken down as follows:

Soviet Embassy - 7 lines
Czech Legation - 2 lines
Polish Legation - 2 lines
American Communists - 5 lines
Remainder - 7 lines


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

Project Reviev

Attachment to HW-A-10198
KAPOK-1401

3. Planning for the Future

During the coming year Station capabilities will be expanded to permit monitor-ing of approximately 20 lines. Basic coverage of Soviet, Czech and Polish activities will be continued to the maximum extent possible and assets and capabilities will be maintained for *expliting important* targets of opportunity. At the present time and with the new system being used for LIFEAT lines, Station believes that 28 will be the maximum number of lines which can be handled properly and securely by the personnel presently assigned here for LIFEAT.

4. Performance of Agents

In general the performance of the LIFEAT agents has been good and secure during the past year. It is hoped that within the coming year the remainder of the AYCALL group will be securely and permanently removed from the Project and replaced by well-compartmented personnel. In view of the high degree of security necessary for the personnel involved in this operation, it is planned to screen very carefully any possible candidates before they are approached for use in this operation after prior approval for an approach has been secured from Headquarters.

Additional comments concerning the production, security and cover of individual agents will be found in the attached amendment to the field outline which was submitted with HMM-W-5708.

5. Expenditures during Period under Review

Approval was granted for the period under review, 1 July 1957 - 30 June 1958, to expend $156,647. The proposed LIFEAT budget for FY 1959 is contained in the attached field project outline Part II.

6. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those provided for in the outline and the individual contracts of several LIFEAT personnel.

PROJECT OUTLINE
(Excerpts)

PROJECT LIFEAT

## 3. Background

Project LIFEAT was initially approved 3 October 1950. Actual operations began on 18 January 1951 and have run almost continuously since that time. The LIFEAT operation was begun with the installation of one telephone tap and has since expanded to an average of 23 telephone lines.

Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation. It is completely independent from any liaison arrangement and it is staffed by KUBARK personnel, both staff and contract, together with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents.

During the time of its operation Project LIFEAT has produced more than 50,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically and has contributed, materially to the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Sino-Soviet bloc. In addition, Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in monitoring the activities of Americans residing in Mexico City in which ODENVY has an interest and also has, at the direction of Headquarters, installed special taps on targets of opportunity.

a. Supervise the operational and administrative activities of all staff, contract and indigenous personnel.

b. Maintain awareness and provide direction in all operational matters pertaining to the management of the LIFEAT Project.

c. Provide guidance and day-to-day supervision of the operational phases LIFEAT/LIMERICK, LITHOSPHERE, LITMUS, LIVERY and American Communist Group in Mexico activities.

d. Coordinate information received from LIMERICK with other Station operations.

e. Maintain LIFEAT capabilities for mounting operations against targets of opportunity.

f. Maintain supervision over basehouses and training of the personnel therein.

9. Personnel

The following are changes from FY 1958 for FY 1959:

Daniel K. BROMUND arrived at Station Mexico to assume duties as translator of LIFEAT/LIIMUS material and relief translator on LIFEAT/LIMERICK.

14. Equipment and Support

It is considered essential that new equipment be provided for LIFEAT for FY 1959 in view of the fact that much of the equipment in current use has been steadily in operation since the inception of the project in 1951. Also, in view of expected expansion of the project and the possibilities of live monitoring, additional equipment in first-class condition will be necessary. A backlog of 10 new recorders and 300 reels along with repair parts is considered a minimum for efficient continuance of the project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

THROUGH: Chief of Operations, DD/P

SUBJECT: Project LIFLAT (Amendment)

1. The attached project, originating in WH Division, is designed to determine Sino/Soviet/Satellite plans, activities, and connections with other communist elements through independent audio-surveillance operations in Mexico. It is presented for your approval of two amendments: the first, to permit the utilization of Roland K. WINGSMISS (p) as an additional Staff Agent in the project, and the second, to establish for cover purposes a $20,000 U. S. bank account for Staff Agent Daniel A. BROMUND (p) in order that he may obtain Rentista status in Mexico.

2. Authority is requested to obligate an additional $26,493 from the DD/P-WH Division budget for fiscal year 1958. Sufficient funds are available in the WH Division budget. If approved, these two amendments will raise the total amount authorized for the present project year, 1 July 1957 through 30 June 1958, to $156,647. Project LIFLAT was renewed by the DDCI on 30 October 1957 in the amount of $130,154.

3. Attached is the LIFLAT Project Outline, which sets forth the important factors involved in the operation; a WH Division memorandum, dated 31 October 1957, which explains the proposal for securing Rentista status for BROMUND; and a WH Division memorandum, dated 13 November 1957, which requests authority to incorporate WINGSMISS into the project as a Staff agent.

4. CCB/MC comments that according to Finance Division, establishing a bank account for BROMUND is the only means of satisfying the requirements of the Mexican government. The Letter of Credit must be irrevocable and allow a stated withdrawal per period (as in this case, per quarter) in order that the full amount cannot be liquidated before the expiration of the Rentista. CCB/MC recommends approval in this connection. In addition CCB/RC recommends approval of the proposed use of WINGSMISS, provided that his cover, which has not been determined as yet, be coordinated with CCB/MC sufficiently in advance to allow CCB/MC to state any objections deemed necessary and to take effective action toward establishing sound cover.

AREA DIVISION: Western Hemisphere Room: 2112 Artsch SI!

STATION: Mexico City  Ext.: 2555 or 562

Date: 21 October 1957

1.  It is requested that the LIFTAT project be amended to include authorization to open a bank account of $20,000 for Daniel K. BROMUND (Staff Agent).
    Project LIFTAT was approved for renewal for the period 1 July 1957 to 30 June 1958.

2.  Subsequent to the renewal of Project LIFFAT, it was determined that the cover appropriate for Daniel K. BROMUND would be that of a dentist. In order to obtain *Rentista* status from the Mexican Government, it is necessary to show documents which prove that the applicant has an income of approximately $350 per month for a period of five years. On approval of this amendment, it is planned to open an account for Daniel K. BROMUND for the amount of $20,000 against which the bank will issue him a Letter of Credit which will permit him to draw against this account at the rate of $1,000 quarterly. This Letter of Credit will then be used to obtain *Rentista* status for BROMUND. This letter of Credit will be held by the Station and will be passed to BROMUND for use once every three months. BROMUND will use this Letter of Credit, withdrawing his $1,000 quarterly, and will immediately deposit this money and the Letter of Credit with the Finance Officer at the Station. These deposits will be accounted for in the Station's accountings.

3.  To protect the United States Government's interest, the necessary Declarations of Trust and/or Assignment of Interest as determined by the Finance Division will be executed and filed with the Monetary Branch, Finance Division.

SUBJECT Administrative/LIFEAT
Procurement of Recorders

References: H91A-8143 (KAPOK 1106), 2 October 1957

ACTION REQUIRED: Clarification of request for recorders.

1.  Paragraph four, e, of reference contains a request for ten used EKOTAPE recorders. However, it is not clear whether this request is in addition to or in place of the request ocntained in MEXI 918, dated 9 August 1957. The recorders requested in MEXI 918 vare forwarded to the Station under cargo numbers 20369 and 20370 on 16 and 17 September 1957 (see DIR 35369 and DIR 35748), and probably arrived at the Station after the referenced dispatch was witten.

2.  There are no used EXOTAPE recorder's available at Headquarters for ship-sent to the Station. Hoyover, KURIOT has advised the Desk that should any used recorders becgée available at Headquarters or at other field stations, thay will make every effort to send them to Mexico City. As the Station probably anque, EAUTAPE recorders are no longer manufactured.

3.  KURIOT requested that the Station be informed that KURIOT appreciates the technical report contained in the reference. They will investigate further the tephrical probleme Experienced by the Stationg the Station will be adviced of any danificant developments. KURIOT considers that six months vee from the Revere heads, under LIFEAT operating conditions, is quite good.

4.  In view of the unavailability of used KKOTAPE recorders and the recent shipment of ten med REVERE recorders, Headquarters will take no further action on the referenced request unless requested to do se by the Station.

# Product of the Project

The Soviet Embassy

## Soviet Commercial Activities

Reports submitted during the past year have conveyed a substantial amount of detail concerning Soviet economic and commercial policy in Mexico, and to a lesser extent, in adjacent areas. This information has reflected the types of products the Soviets are selling and purchasing in Mexico, the number of their intermediaries, details on prices, procedures used for arranging sales and purchases and the manner of effecting shipments. This information has been screened from extensive and prolonged coverage of Soviet embassy commercial traffic and appears to be accurate and detailed. Within the past year traffic concerning the Soviet commercial office in Mexico has increased considerably and remains the Station's primary source for information on Soviet commercial activities. Pertinent examples of this type of information may be found in:

> HPT-2176, dated 1 March 1957 "Tentative Deal for Ecuadorian Coffee"

> HPT-1973, dated 15 October 1956 "Mexican Exports to the USSR"

> HPT-1760, dated 19 October 1956, "sale of Soviet Ferrous Metal in the U.S."

## Soviet Diplomatic Activities

Project LIFAT coverage of Soviet diplomatic activities appears to have been quite thorough and enlightening during the past year. Reports submitted on these activities have indicated some relationships the Soviets are developing with the Mexican Government, with other Latin American governments, and with other foreign diplomatic representatives. LIFAT operations have also established some facts concerning the relations among the Soviets, Poles and Czechs in Mexico City. Some indication has been received on the relations between the Soviets and the Yugoslavs. Reports of this type provide some evidence as to when the Soviets appear to be engaged in a drive to establish contacts in various departments of the Mexican

## d. Soviet Military Activities

Monthly reports are prepared from LIFAT information on contacts between Soviet and Mexican military personnel. They reflect the identities of the local military figures with whom the Soviets maintain contact and in most cases contain some data on the reasons for the contact. These reports are of particular interest to the U.S. service attaches in Mexico.

## e. Movements of Soviet Officials

The arrivals and departures of Soviet officials have been reported in almost every instance during the past five years through LIFAT coverage. Frequently the Station has determined forthcoming departures long before they took place by careful study and interpretation of LIFAT materials indicating Soviet contacts with local clothiers and other merchants selling luxury items - it is the habit of Soviets, prior to departure from Mexico, to stock up on items which are not available in the USSR. This type of coverage is of particular interest to OLEVI.

## f. Soviet Embassy Contacts

Monthly reports of contacts by members of the Soviet diplomatic corps are compiled and submitted to Headquarters. These reports are of considerable value in planning agent operations against the Soviets. They are also of operational assistance in identifying local and foreign Communists with whom the Soviets maintain regular contact. The following reports are examples of this type of coverage:

14-2376, dated 31 January 1957, "Contacts CS-3-53,712 of Soviet Embassy, Mexico City, December 1956."

14-2459, dated 27 February 1957, "Contacts CS-3-53,521 of Soviet Embassy, Mexico City, January 1957."

## g. Personality Reports on Soviet Officials

LIFAT has been a very productive source for collecting personality information on Soviets. Such data as Soviet contacts, marital situations, official duties, etc., are of value in determining which officials may be susceptible to recruitment


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

and/or defection. A case in point 1 be the present Soviet Naval Attache, Grigorl WIKIPOR. A recent study of his background and habits indicated that his wife might be vulnerable to recruitment because she may have improper relations with one of her male subordinates. A summary of the personality report dated 1 May 1957, subject: "Loris Pavlovich 1 A.K.A.".

h. Goods and Services Provided to the Soviet Embassy

Periodic reports of the persons and Institutions providing goods and services to the Soviet Embassy have been of considerable value in developing and mounting a limited operation. This type of information is valuable in determining the identity of individuals having access to the Soviet Embassy who can later be recruited by the Station as controlled agents. Ref: C-2, dated 27 February 1957, subject: "Goods and Services Paid by the Soviet Embassy, Mexico City, counter 1956 - January 1957", is an example of the Station's reporting of this type of operational information.

i. Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy

LIITAT material relating to the Soviet Embassy, which does not fit into any general category, is set forth each month in a series of reports on miscellaneous activities. These reports include such random information as banking transactions, landscaping activities, evidences of internal construction, etc. The following reports are cited as examples of this type of information:

Mi-2375, dated 30 January 1957, "Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy, Mexico City, December 1956."

RE-2448, dated 27 February 1957, "Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy, Mexico City, January 1957."

The French Legation

The information obtained on the (Czech Legation during the past year is basically the same as the information obtained on the Soviet Embassy; consequently, to avoid repetition in this review, only the highlights of (Czech Legation coverage are mentioned.

a. Data Pertaining to (Czech Personnel

The LIIT/AI collection effort in this connection has been productive. Reports have reflected personality data, official functions and domestic matters pertaining to Czech staff members and information suitable for use in planning defection approaches.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

The following reports are cited as examples of this type of information:

HR-1896, dated 23 September 1956, "Czech Legation Personnel."

HR-1959, dated 17 October 1956, "Czech Legation Personnel."

HR-2330, dated 15 January 1957, "Czech Legation Personnel."

b. Spot Reports on Czech Legation Activities

Spot reports are submitted periodically on matters of interest which pertain to the Czech Legation. Examples of these reports are:

HR-1779, dated 10 September 1956, "Proposed Czech-Mexican Barter Transaction."

HR-1814, dated 19 September 1956, "Travel of Czech Commercial Representatives."

HR-1877, dated 9 October 1956, "Travel of Enrique CASTRO Garcia."

HR-1987, dated 24 October 1956, "Czech Delegates to the IX International Congress of Geology."

Polish Legation

As with the Czech Legation, information pertaining to the Polish Legation parallels closely the type of information reported about the Soviet Embassy. By far the largest amount of information obtained on the Polish Legation during the past year has resulted from LIFEAT coverage. Biographic information on Polish staff members has been forwarded to Headquarters. The following examples of spot reports were forwarded for Headquarters' dissemination:

HR-1714, dated 29 August 1956, "Polish Legation Reception Commemorating 11th Anniversary of Day of Liberation."

HR-1748, dated 31 August 1956, "Polish Legation Contacts with Polish Delegates to the Eighth International Radiology Congress."

## Mexican Communist Party and Concunt-t Fronts

A significant amount of information was received from LIPAT during the past year concerning the Mexican Communist Party and Communist Party front organizations. The latter includes information on the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos, the Morican Peace Movement, the Society of Friends of Chinm and various art fronts. This information has been of value in supplementing agent coverage of those organizations. The following reports are examples of this type of information:

HAK-1657, dated 18 July 1956, "Narciso SO SOLS."

H-2285, dated 29 November 1956, "Xavior
2S- CUBERO Saucedo and Clara orast
de GULBRIFO."

## American Communists in Mexico

One of the most extensive and productive coverages initiated through LIFT during the past year was directed against American Comunists in Mexico. Most of these targets were covered at the request of COENVY and the production was processed in part by OLENVY. A total of 342 reels of information were recorded on three separate cases. A fourth case, LOMAYFOIL, was mounted at the suggestion of ODETTY just 15 hours after the station received the request from Headquarters. The Station has received three commodations from Headquarters on the LIPAT Age of this case and Edward P. SFCHEN received a personal commendation from the DCI for his work on this operation. Over 90 reels of valuable information have been produced since the beginning of this operation on 9 February 1957.

## Mexican Government

During the early part of 1957 LIFEAT Coverage provided the means for the Station to assess reports from another source concerning the hardening of the Mexican Government's attitude toward foreign Communists. LIFAT coverage of various individual targets provided reliable information on the arrests of the foreign omniste Mario BOSA Navarro, Josquin ORLUI, Jacobo

ITZ Zender and Come and tented to confirm data on the same matters of tained throch other station sources. LIFEAT also aided details which were not available to other station sources, such as the names of the persons we sought to help those imprisoned; for example, LIFE established that the Venezuelan was the person holding the passport of Carquin, the time of his arrest; this fact, among others, makes appear to be one of the most important foreign Communists in Mexico. The below listed reports contain information of this type:

HA-6210, dated 6 March 1957

HA-6212, dated 6 March 1957

HM-1769, page four, dated 12 September 1976, is cited as containing an apparently reliable report to the effect that in 1936 the Mexican president told the editor of one of Mexico's leading newspapers that he should play down or omit anti-U.S. articles and opinions.

LIBEL Information

LIFEAT has contributed materially to several matters having LABICIE interest.

Counter Intelligence Information

(I/CR matters constitute a major portion of the Mexico City Station's priority objectives. Project LIFEAT has contributed more leads and general information on the Soviet aspect of this subject than all other station sources combined. A few representative samples of this type of information are listed below:

![scribbled circle]HM-1958, dated 9 October 1956, and HM-2206, dated (23-1296)/ 2 January 1957 describe contacts between Narciso EASALES, leading mexican pro-Communist, and Viktor H. GOFFOV, his Soviet case officer.

HM-2420, dated 8 February 1957, sets forth arrangements for clandestine contact between Colonel Jesus de LEON Toral, of the Mexican General Staff College, with his Soviet case officer.

HM-2270, dated 19 December 1976, sets forth contacts between Nikolay PIZHIV, Soviet intelligence officer, and Jesus RAZO Lemero, Mexican naval officer.

Coverage of the Jevian Correnist leader, Fensel ETH hagidin, confirmed the decline of the local Jewish Corruaist noverment and the final liquidation of its headquartere. It also produced the names of the few active members wio continue to moet informally. It was of value in covering the arrest of Chone SIETHEA meriter of the Jewish Coranist croup, and the deportation of Jacobo Z Zender, known (omunist acont.

Further, LIFLAT has established that the Lica l'opular Israelita, a Jewish Countst front organisation, is slrost defunct and quite inactive.

## Hidden Microphone Operation

Conclusion

The exico City Station and the leade arters Mexico est agree that the product t of the LTAT Project measured aral st the onendi ture of rency sassets in terms of pan foon ol, the, security tyrisks and funds well justifies its recual. The inforation prochiced by this operation has contributed raterfalls and substantially to several priorit objectives of the exico City Station's Poleted Mission Directive.

2. Progress of the eration

Definite progress has been ado in reporting on the objectives of the LIFEAT project; however, all objectives are of a continuing nature and are not cosigned to be fully achieved. For this reason, no statistics can be cited as to the percentage of coverage on each objective. A general indication can be derived of the scope of the project by realizing that approximately 15,000 pares of Fursary text have been obtained from LIFEAT during the past year. An averaro of 23 siltaneous coverajce on a 24 hour por day basis has been maintained during this review pertod. Generally, thoce coverages may be trozen con as follows:

Soviet Embassy 8 linee
Czech Legation 2-11708
Polish legation 2.lines
Amorican :
Corrruntats 3 lines
Pemainder 8 lines

3. Planning for the Future

During the coming year Station capabilities will be expanded to permit monitoring approximately 30 lines. Basic coverage of Soviet, (sech and Polish activitice will be continued to the nuxdmun extent possible and assets and capabilities will be pain yained for exploiting Laportant targets of opportunity. At the present the the Station Pelieves that 30 lines are about the maxis load the technical agents corimed to A can properly handle and protect. The station is currently preparing plane for submission to ondquarters which call for the establishment of a sinilar but separato and compertientes pe operation. Such a project would have now arents not previously associated with or knowlodgeable about LITAT.

# PROJECT OUTLINE

## PART I

1. Area of operations

This project will be run from the Mexico City Station. It will be concerned with targets located in Mexico City.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to determine Sino-Soviet plans, activities and connections with other communist elements through the use of technical surveillance. This purpose appears to be in consonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico (dated 7 May 1957), Priority A, Objective One.

3. Background

Project LIFEAT was approved initially on 3 October 1950. Actual operations began on 18 January 1951 and have run continuously since that time. The LIFEAT operation was begun with the installation of one telephone tap and has expanded since that time to an average daily monitoring of 23 telephone lines and from one to four hidden microphone installations (the microphone operations were originally under a separate project-LIGOL).

Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation. It is completely independent from any liaison arrangement and is staffed by Agency staff and contract employees together with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents.

During the past six years Project LIFEAT has produced more than 40,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically and has contributed materially to the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Sino-Soviet bloc. In addition, Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in monitoring the activities of Americans residing in Mexico City in which JMWAVE has major interest.

## 12. Contact and Communications

a. Contact and communications between the case officer and the agents and undercover personnel in this operation is maintained in a clandestine manner. Various patterns have lean established by which the aronte and the case officers follow prearranged signals for the meetings. When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, the meetings are always held at nights. All movement in and out of bases by the Case Dicere and Principal Apente is done in cars ostensiblyoned by the base apente, exrept in the case of LIVERY, vhare the agents are too ald to drive. One of the local arents is usually used to contact the LIVE! here. Entrance to the bases by foot is made only in great merrencies.

b. Telephonte contact concerning the Project is kept to a minimum and a code system of cipite and cryptonyms has been devised for use by the agents and case officers for phone conversations.

c. Alternate and emergency signals have been worked out.

d. In general these systems of contact and communication have been in practice for over six years and appear to have been suitable to the work. In detail, locations and tines of seetings have been changed frequently.

## 13. Control and Motivation

The indigenous arente on this project project are motivated by t


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

following factores:

a. The LI DAMER group: Motivated by high salaries and present studying there. They are further controlled by fear of police action.

b. The LIVESTOCK group: Motivated by family loyalty, good salaries and pro-PP Outlook. They are further controlled by fear of police action.

c. The LIMITATION group: Motivated by pro-PPP sentiments, LIMITATT being a POPENE citizens and LIMITATT having resided there for many years.

d. The LIPSTICK group: Motivated by family loyalties, good salaries and personal loyalty to LOST.

e. The LIQUIDATION group: Motivated by family loyalty and good salary. LI, himself, is anti-communist, control is ideological and monetary.

14. Equipment and Support

It is believed that the supply of equipment for LIFEAT currently at the Station is sufficient to carry the operation through the calendar year 1957, but it is possible that simultaneous breakdown of quantities of the older equipment, dating from 1951 and in constant use since then, would necessitate the placing of separate orders for replacements.

15. Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception in January 1951 and it is planned to continue it indefinitely.

DOCUMENT ANCROFILM SERVICE

The following report is keyed to the headings required in FN 52-670 sec 3c2.

a. Processing of information: No change. The LCMAYFOWL phase of the operation was live monitored all day and during the early evening hours. A large number of ZOHAR abstract sheets, made out by Olivia Gladmon and Alice Gailleteau, were forwarded to Headquarters. Gladion was also used on the processing of the Maurice HALPERIN target. During June the new system of making numerous carbon copies of the traffic was further developed and hence more copies were made available for clipping and putting into "P" (201) files. Routine reporting on monthly developments, particularly pertaining to the LEGERICK phase, was continued on the same basis as in the past.

b. Exploitation of leads: Leads connected with the visit of the alleged Communist agent Jacobo UCHNIK, from Argentina were followed through the Manrice HALPERIN line and were coordinated with other activities on the case. From LIFT coverage it was also ascertained that LCWAYFONE was in contact with Boris PDRYAKOV, RIS case officer stationed at the Soviet Embassy. This knowledge, obtained by voice recognition of KOLORYAKOV in a single contact with the LCMAYFOWL target, resulted in the mounting of a physical surveillance of the LOMAYFOEL target which confirmed the existence of the contact and enable the station to derive further information of importance. In a third instance, LIFEAT contact between a Mexican Army officer and an RIS officer enabled the station to make plans to cover a meeting between them scheduled for 3 July 1957. Finally, coverage of LIMERICK targets commercial lines enabled the station to direct various investigations which resulted in the identification of several commercial contacts of that establishment.

c. Liaison: Not applicable..

d. Security: Security on the project remained without substantial change. Nothing further has developed from the alleged blackmail plot of April 1957. On the other hand, the activities of the local telephone company, which is now more solvent than in many years because of a new financial setup, continued to cause problems and temporary suspensions of work. LITHUS was not run during the entire month and the Maurice HALPERIN phase was suspended after about a week's operation owing to the presence of telephone crews in the same block as the base house as well as at other points along the LITMUS segment of the net. It was observed


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 189

that the telephone crew had the habit of putting a high ladder up to the roof of any house upon which they wished to work, whereas in the past it had been their custom to ring the doornell, ask permission to go to the roof and do so through the house where they wished to work. This new custom brought about the need to study emergency procedures and redraw them. A limited experiment was made on one line with some success. This experiment consisted of leaving the hot stub of one line on the base roof as usual, but instead of leading it directly into the opera-tions rcom, as previously, it was attached loosely to a lead-in made of sorter wire of the type used for interior installations. In the moment of need, the base operator had merely to haul on the soft lead, which therewith parted from the out-side wire. Upon reaching the roof, therefore, the telephone men found only a stub ending in random fashion. This emergency method is considered better than none but is satisfactory for ro more than one line at a time. It is the further dis-advantage in that the outside wire stub is "hot" and could be checked by the telephone crew who, as they have done in the past on a few occasions, might call tre target on that hot stub to see where he was located. In general, the station continues to recommend that when telephone crews are working near a base or along its net, crosses should be pulled and the operation suspended till the crews have left the neighborhood.. An exception was made in the Halperin case because it was hoped the line would shed light on LCHAYFOWL.

e. Technical: No technical problems were encountered in June 1957.

f. Personnel and Administrative: No problems of a personnel or administra-tivë nature were noted.

g. Miscellaneous: LIFLAT Annex IV was rented early in June and is being readied for use on three to five targets during July. LIMERICK Annex II is still out of service owing to the absence of LIGATION and the continuance of work in the zone by the telephone company. LIVERY is out of service owing to the retire-ment of LIMESTONES 1 and 2 from active duty on account of the alleged blackmail plot of April 1957. LEDERICK Annex III is out of service and will not be recon-missioned. One of its LIM RICK target lines was changed over to LIMERICK main base on 28 June. The other two lines from Anriex III should be installed at LIMERICK main base during July.

During June 1957 the following lines were monitored part or full times

7 - LIMERICK office lines out of 8 existing. Two were suspended for some two weeks because of the telephone company activity in their sone.
2- LITHOSPH RE lines
1 - LCMAYFOWL line
1- Maurice HALPERLEN line (for about a week only)

During June the following cables, H's and informational HMAS were based entirely or in part on LIFEAT:

MEMORANDUM FOR: WH/3 Mexico

SUBJECT: Project LIVRAT

REFERENCE: Memorandum for Chief, EE/Czechoslovakia from Chief, WH, subject as above, dated 3 July 1957

The LIVERY phase of Project LIFEAT continues to provide considerable biographic data on the members of the Czech Legation in Mexico City, which EE/Czechoslovakia finds most useful in the evaluation of these individuals as possible targets for recruitment, either in Mexico City or upon their assignment to another overseas post. For this reason EE/Czechoslovakia is interested in seeing Project LIFEAT renewed.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WI

SUBJECT: Project LIFEAT/LITHUS

1. Reference is made to your memorandum of 3 July 1957 concerning the renewal of Project LIFEAT for the period 1 July 1957 through 30 June 1958. The LITHUS portion of this project is of primary interest to the Polish Branch, and as part of the increasing priority of KUBARK interest in Poland and Polish targets, it is strongly recommended that the project be continued.

2. This reaffirmation of our interest in LITHUS is based on the coverage it afforded up to December 1956 at which time the case officer/monitor handling LITHUS departed Mexico. This coverage was mainly of operational value in providing the following types of information:

(a) Indications of Legation plans to move which lead to the station's investigating the possibilities of installing microphores in strategic places which would have immeasurably improved our knowledge of Polish activities in Mexico.

(b) Legation security practices which are useful in predicting or interpreting changes elsewhere.

(c) Repatriation effort which has been of interest in itself and is of potential value in determining what part of this effort is connected with the PIS activity in Mexico.

(d) Travel and other information concerning the TDY presence in Mexico of important PIS personalities which assists in the world wide coverage of these individuals.

(e) Some information about the PIS representatives assigned to the Legation.

(f) Confirmatory information concerning some basic aspects of developmental activities such as LIMETRIC.

(g) Biographic and personality information in varying degrees of completeness about each of the individuals


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 193

assigned to the Legation and some intication as to their
activities and contacts. This data is most useful in
assisting in the assessment and selection of these indi-
viduals as potential recruitment targets.

(h) Positive intelligence concerning commercial,
cultural/proaganda, and diplomatic activities of the
Legation personnel. The fact that the disseminations have
been relatively few, is due to the usual limitations in-
herent in this type of audio operation.

3. The method of reporting information from LITHUS (sepa-
   rate reports on Legation officials and on the various subjects
   of interest) has been extremely well done and most useful to
   EE/P in assessing any specific personality, or an operational
   situation. It is hoped that with this basic information from
   LITNUS now available in each case, the station will be able to
   put the operational leads to use. Our recomendation for the
   continuance of LITMUS is based on the assumption that KUBARK.
   operations in Mexico against the Poles will now be ained pri-
   marily at the clarification of the status of the PIS in Mexico,
   the recruitment of Polish officials within the Legation, and
   answering the basic question of what the Fales are doing in
   Mexico. It is believed that LITNUS is essential to the support
   of this effort.

4. As an example of our interest in Nexico and LITHUS, it
   is pointed out that a Satellite case officer from the EE Division:
   is currently preparing to depart for Mexies. It is also planned
   thet a Polish speaking contract agent, experienced in Polish
   operations 1roluding monitoring audio efforts, will be sent to
   Mexico in the near future to work on LITHOS and to assist this
   case officer.

Not present

STATION Mexico City

CHIEF OF STATION Willard C. CURTIS

1. The attached Field Project outline is submitted for approval for the Fiscal Year 1958. In accordance with field instruction No. 236-1, 7(d), (dated 23 October 1953), the following information is submitted.

Product of the basic project.

During the current fiscal year production from LIFEAT has been quite voluminous. The Soviet phase alone has accounted for sore 5,000 pages of summary text and constitutes somewhat less than half the coverage yielded by the total project. The following general categories of information have been developed through LIFEAT and are cited below with a few examples of production(see references to specific reports and dispatches in the following paragraphs).

2. The Soviet Embassy.

Information on the Soviet Embassy derived from LIFEAT has been voluminous and extensive reports have been furnished on the following matters:

a. Soviet Comercial Activities.

Reports such as H-2198, 3 March 1957; H-2054, 6 November 1956; and H.-1975, 19 October 1956 have conveyed a substantial amount of month-to-month detail concerning Soviet economic and commercial policy and actions in Mexico and to a lesser extent in adjacent areas. This information reflects the types of products the Soviets are selling or purchasing in the area, the names of their intermediaries, details on prices, manner of arranging deals, and manner of effecting shipments. This information was screened out and briefed from extensive and prolonged coverage of Soviet Embassy commercial traffic and appears to be fully authentic as well as rich in detail. Reference is also made to H-2476, 1 March 1957 (Tentative Deal for Ecuadorian Coffee); H.-1973, 18 October 1956(Mexican exports to the USA); and H-1760, 18 October 1956 (Sale of Soviet Ferrous Metal in the US) as examples of specific spot reports based on information derived from the same source. During the past year traffic concerning the Soviet commercial office in Mexico has increased a great deal and remains this Station's primary source on all such matters.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 201

b. Soviet Diplomatic Activities

Reference is made to HI-2327, HI-2395 and HI-2405 as examples of the type of monthly reports now being submitted relative to the diplomatic activities of the Soviet Embassy. These reports, based almost entirely on LIFEAT, indicate some relationships the Soviets are developing with the Mexican Government, with other Latin American governments, and with other foreign diplomatic representatives. They also shed some light on the relations between the Soviets, Poles and Czechs in Mexico City; and even on the relationships between the Soviets and the Yugoslavs. Reports of this type show when the Soviets seem to be engages in a drive to establish contacts in various departments of the Mexican Government and when they appear to be conducting a drive to cultivate Latin American diplomats. The reactions of both the Mexicans and the Latin Americans to these advances are often shown in the corresponding traffic. The Soviets, in general, do not seem to get a very good reception from the Latin Americans, but on the other hand, LIFEAT shows that they are well received by the diplomatic representatives of India and Indonesia. The diplomatic reports have also shown an improvement of relations with the Yugoslavs (which were non-existent for several years here). The traffic and reports further show that the Soviets, Poles and Czechs have frequent interchange and other join in days of sport or other entertainment.

c. Cultural and Propaganda Activities

HI-2329, HI-2377 and HI-2460 are cited as examples of the monthly summaries of Soviet cultural activities based on LIFEAT materials. They reflect in detail Soviet activities in connection with publication, cultural institutes, travel of Mexicans to the USSR for cultural purposes, visits of Soviet cultural figures to Mexico and data concerning how their local arrangements are made. HI-2326 is cited as an example of a separate report on the visit of some Soviet musicians to Mexico.

d. Contacts of the Soviet Embassy

HI-2376 and HI-2459 are examples of monthly summaries of contacts of the Soviet Embassy. These are of value in planning agent operations against the Soviets since they list various contacts known to be maintained by them. This type of report also lists the local and foreign Communists with whom the Soviets are in contact each month, together with a description of the nature of the contact when known.

e. Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy

LIFEAT material relating to the Soviet Embassy, which does not fit into any general category, is set forth each month in a series of reports on miscellaneous activities. These reports include such random information

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

# Military Activities of the Soviet Embassy

MI-2391 and MI-2450 are examples of monthly reports of Soviet contacts with Mexican military circles and are derived almost entirely from LIFLAT materials, reflecting the identities of the local military figures with whom the Soviets maintain contact and most cases contain at least some data on the reasons for the contact. These reports are of considerable interest to American service attaches in Mexico.

C. Goods and Services of the Soviet Embassy

MI-2452 is an example of periodic reporting on the persons and institutions providing goods and services to the Soviet Embassy. These reports have been of particular interest in developing the LINCS Project and resulted in the making of a contact in the cleaning business through which this Station obtained entry for one of its agents into the Embassy. (Cf HI-A-6372).

h. Personality Reports on Soviet Officials

HI-A-6051 is a sample of a series of personality reports on Soviet officers prepared mainly from LIFLAT materials. LIFLAT reflects varying amounts of information on the Soviets. Some are frequently heard and much data accumulated on their contacts, marital situations, official duties, etc. These data have been used on occasion for studying possible defection pitches and will probably be used more in the future. In the case of the current Soviet Naval Attache, Grigori MIKHAILOV, his habits were studied mainly through LIFLAT and note was made that his wife might be vulnerable because she was having amorous relations with one of her husband's subordinates. (LEXI 524; LIXI 495; LIXI 447).

i. Movements of Soviet Officials

The arrivals and departures of Soviet officials have more often been ascertained through LIFLAT than through any other source. The Station has been able to advise of movements out of Mexico through LIFLAT in almost every case where such travel took place in the past five(5) years. Frequently the Station has received notice of movement long before it took place by studying contacts of the Soviets with local clothiers, etc. since it has been the Soviet custom to stock up on clothing and various luxuries prior to leaving Mexico. The arrivals of many Soviets have been learned of only through LIFLAT, even in a number of cases when the Soviets travelled

through the U.S. EAI-853, 4 Parch 1957, is an example of this type of coverage. Kotice of Lis arrival first appeared in the traffic on 26 February 1957. 1514-6842 is referred to as an exalo ofis Station's ction's coverage of unusual Soviet courier travel, in part based on LIAT.

J. Various Spotmeports

2001, describing the Soviet Embassy reception of 7 November 1956, is cited as an example of numerous spot reports on Soviet massy activites on which information was oftained mainly or on tirely trou LIDT These reports are also put out to cover the trawl of Soviets in the country of Next co (Xi-907, travel of Pavel LA ISROV, Soviet consul, to uevo Laredo on 11 Farch 1957).

3. Czech Legation

LIFEXT has provided consideretle incormation on the Czech Legation during the past year. The information thus octained is rou hly parallel to that obtained on the Soviet. Embassy, and periodic general aumaries have been forwarded in 1-1505, -1632, H-1693, -1997, 12-1747, IC-2349 arid others.

a. Personnel data

Personnel data on staff members of the Czech Lezation have been forwarded in such reports as K-1896, H-1959, 0-2330 and others.. This date has been of use not only in reflecting perscrality data, official functions and domestic matters pertaining to Czech staff members cut also in planning defection approaches.

b. Spot Reports

From time to time sot reports on matters of especial interest in connection with the Czech Legation have teen forwarded, ajong which referance is made to the following entirely or partially tased on LICEAT:

-1779, Froposed Barter Transaction;
11-1814, Travel of Czech Commercial depresentatives;
-1935, Vera arie PASILOVA;
1-1977, Travel of Enrique CASTRO Garcia; and
1331-1937, Czech Delegation to scological Congress.

c. LIFEAT. Coverage

During most of the year LIFEAT coverage of the Czech Legation was confined to the two phones in the main Legation building but early in 1957 one of the two lines of the Commercial Ofice was crossed and very high production received. It is projected that this basic coverage will te continued to the extent circunstances permit.

4. Polish Legation

H2-1789, entitled "Soviet Bloc Economic Penetration in Mexico" is an example of a report of a general nature based on LISSAT coverage of Poles, Czechs and Soviets.

6. Counter-intelligence retters

Counter-intelligence matters constitute the major I portions of this of this Station's melated Mission Directive and it has contributes more leads and general information on the Sovict aspect of this subject than all other Station sources contined. The following reports arc cited as examples of many of this type of reports and information developed in this category:

a. 111:-1953, HMM-2266, describing contacts between arciso DASOLS, leading Mexican pro-Communist, a.d Viktor GLOTOV, his Soviet case officer who appears in LIST under the name of "LOEZ."

b. 0-2218, H.-2262 and 11: 1336, dealing with the contacts between the leading Venezuelan Comunist, Carlos Auston and his Soviet case officer, Doris ?. KOLORYAKOV. A comparison of recwings from LIFAT/LDERICK wita coverage on the Venezuelan Comunistarty Officer duardo ACEDO Morales indicates that is probably the intermediary between the Soviets and the Venezuelan exiles.

c. HK-2120, setting forth arrangements for clandestinc contact between Colonel Jesus de LCD Toral, of the Mexican General Starr College, with his Soviet case officer,

and i. Many others.

7. Double Agent Checking

During the past year, as in previous jears, a number of this Station's double agents have been moritored through LIFAT in contact with the Soviet Embass, thus enabling the Station to verify certain portions of weir reports and hence leading to a letter chance to evaluate the agento. Anong those heard in the past year wore LIBEL FE, Lil's son, LILEYOKADE LEACE and LINSTOCK-1. In each case LAT tended to confirm the Station's zexi opinion of the agent. on the other hand, several recent contacts former Statior agent LIVELOCK-3 and the Soviets indicate that LIVESTOCK-3 may be "plajing" with the Soviete or endeavoring to do so.

8. LAUKICLE

Peference is made to 125923(0-843) which sets forth data on Soviet LAbr.ICLE matters, derived mainly from LIA.. rersonality date LAICLE figures, especially in the rolisn and Czech establishments, has been accumulated and studied as a major Station osjective.

9. Intentions and Activities of the lexican Loverment

During the early part of 1957 LIFFAT erabled the Station to assess reports it was receiving from another source concerning the changing and hardening of the Mexican government's attitude towards foreign Communists. LIFEAT coverage of various individual targets gave solid information on the arrests of the foreign Communists Mario SUSA Havarro, Joaquin 0,

01.-1769(2.4) is cited as containing a seemingly reliable report to the effect that in 1956 the Hexican presiucnt told the editor of one of Mexico's leaking newspapers that he should play down or omit anti-US articles and opinions.

## 10. Infomation on the lexican Communist arts and Communist Fonts

During the past year considerable day to day detail was received from LILAT concerning the Fexican Communist Party and its fronts. The latter included the Circulo de Estudios ilexicanos (the intellectual author of which was covered in LEAT) and the Mexicar Fence Movement, society of friends of China and various art fronts (through coverage of an officer of those movements.) This information was of value in supplementing agent coverage of those orgmisations and occasionally provided information unknown to the agents. (C: 101-1657 and HMK-2285)

## 11. Arcrican Communists in Mexico

One of the most extensive and productive coverages through LIFEAT in the past year was directed against American communists in Mexico. In this period several american targets were covertu at the request of OU VYard the production processed in part by then and in part by this Station. O assured the task of reporting most of the information on these subjects but provided the station with carton copies of their summaries of the pertinent reels and of the reports based thereon. The subjects thus covered for ODENVY were as follows, with a listing of the mumber of reels passed on each:

a. Noah S30RR, possible American espionage agent for the Soviets (2) reels)
b. Frederich Vanderbilt IED, Azerican Comunist, and his wife, Anita Boyer STLD (254 reels)
c. Asa Colinski, American Communist agent(55 reels.)

## 12. Of particular inportance in the coverage by LIFEAT was the Alfred Kaufmann ich was of particular interest not only to LAK but

and Hartha Dodd STLR, case

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 207

also to ODENVY. This case was a part of the Jack S___es case; and LILEAT coverage of the STELIS has been outstandingly excellent. In fact, the Station has had three(3) commendations from Headquarters on the LILEAT coverage of this case and Edward P. SSSolm had a personal commendation from ASC.A on his work(LIFAT) on the case. Over ninety (90) reels have been produced by LILEAT on the STELIS between 9 February and 27 April 1957. Another interesting facet of this coverage is that on 6 February 1957 a cable from headquarters asked that the Station attempt to institute LILEAT coverage on the STELIS. At 1000 hours on 9 February 1957 LILEAT coverage had been completed and was producing.

13. Miscellaneous Coverages

During the past year the following individual targets have been covered for periods of time varying from one month to a full year:

a. Aaron Jose PSZISHA Margules, Jewish Communist leader. The coverage reflected the decline of the Jewish Communist movement and the relative inactivity of PSZISHA and was suspended.

b. Noah SEBOKER, American Communist. He and his wife work for a travel agency and their traffic has reflected many details concerning the movements of Americans in and out of Mexico, many of them Communists.

c. Samuel NAGID: Nagidin, Jewish Communist leader. This coverage confirmed the decline of the local Jewish Communist movement and the final liquidation of its headquarters. It reflected the names of the few active members who continue to meet informally. It was of especial value in covering the arrest of Chone SHEINRAUK, member of the Jewish Communist group, and in covering the deportation of Jacobo HURWITZ Zender, known Communist agent. From this coverage details were learned concerning the names of the lawyers used by the defendants, together with a considerable view of the methods and secondary contacts.

d. Alfred K. (and Martha Dodd) SILK (see para 12), which was probably the most outstanding technical surveillance operation ever mounted by this Station and which is still continuing.

e. Eduardo FACIO Morales, Venezuelan Communist. This coverage conveyed a host of details on the machinations and activities of the Venezuelan Communists in Mexico and to a lesser degree provided information on their contacts with the Soviets and Mexican Communists.

f. Xavier GUERRERO. This coverage contained considerable detail on the Communist party, Society of Friends of China, Peace Front and other organizations of which GUERRERO was a member. It also contained details of great interest on various Latin American Communists and Americans with whom the GUERREROS were in contact. Information derived from this line

Attachment to [redacted]--7053
[redacted]-986
5 June 1957


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

was used in inducing the Mexican Government to deport Mario Sosa Lavarro and thus provided the Station with the means to test one of its more potent sources as well as check the accuracy of his progress reports.

6. Narciso LASSOLS BASSOLS is a leading collaborator of the Soviets in Mexico. Coverage of his traffic showed him in contact with his Soviet case officer and gave details of interest on Mexican political matters and one important Communist front, the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos, of which BASSOLS was the intellectual author though not a member.

h. Asa ZAIZ Dolinska, American Communist mentioned above.

i. Headquarters of the Liga Popular Israelita, Jewish Communist front. This coverage reflected that the Liga was almost defunct.

j. Fernando Alberto KILLA, Argentino Naval Attache, who was covered briefly in connection with the proposed defection of a Soviet official with whom he was in contact.

14. Microphone Phase

LIFEAT Project also includes the LICOOL phase. Reference is made to REMI 005 which describes a current BIOOL installation directed against a Soviet official.

15. Summary

In summary, LIFEAT constitutes one of Mexico City Station's chief assets; and it is the belief of COS Mexico that this operation(which is wholly BARA's and has no liaison or other service involved) is by far the best operation of its kind BARA has in the world.

a. Accomplishments

On a general average over the past year LIFEAT has consisted of twenty-two(22) to twenty-three(23) simultaneous coverages, each of 24 hours per day. The targets covered have included major coverage of all those which rank highest in the Station's FND(Soviets, Poles and Czechs) as well as a large number of selected targets of opportunity. Approximately 15,000 pages of summary text have been obtained from the project. This information, though fragmentary at times and at times difficult to understand, is nevertheless documentary in nature. In detail, average coverage of the targets at the Station has been as follows:

Soviets 8 Lines American Communists 3 lines
Czeans 2 lines Remainder 8 lines
Poles 2 lines

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

# 14-00000

## b. Planning for the Future

Current planning calls for the continuation of about 24 lines of coverage with bases and personnel being assembled to permit an increase to about 30 lines, local circumstances permitting. Basic coverage will be continued to the fullest extent possible on the Soviets, Poles and Czechs, which coverage of individual and targets of opportunity will be shifted so as to produce the greatest possible amounts of important information. At present it is believed that 30 lines is about the maximum the technical agents on this one operation. can mount and protect properly. In order to get more coverage, the Station will likely establish(if headquarters approves) a separate, independent LIFEAT-type operation, with new principals.

## c. Performance of Agents

While in general the performance of the LIFEAT agents has been good in the past year, some of those connected with the group based on the family of former head agent James O. AYCALL have not been acting in a satisfactory manner. These are gradually being weeded out and new, more effective and fully compartmented base operators are being substituted for them. The Station's problem in this. connection is difficult since it is hard to recruit persons who combine the following qualifications necessary for base house operations:

1.  absolute discretion;
2.  willingness to cover the base 24 hours daily, year after year;
3.  suitable cover;
4.  willingness to obey complex orders to the letter year after year;
5.  willingness to live in a situation of constant potential danger.

## d. Status of Approved Commitments

LIFEAT Project(as approved in HI--3740) contains most of the elements which will be necessary in Fiscal 1956. The main difference that will be noted in the attached Field Project Outline is that costs will be higher and one more base house will be added to the current list.

CHIEF OF STATION

Willard C. CUTTIS

2. Purpose

To mount various types of technical surveillance operations, mainly telephonic, against the Soviet, Caech and olish diplomatic missions in Mexico; against important contacts of those instalations; and against leading Hexican and non-Mexican Communists and Communist sympathizers.

3. Dackground

This project was first approved 3 October 1950 and has been extended each year thereafter. Actual operations began 18 January 1951 and have been continuous, with small breaks for security or other operational reasons from that date. The project was last approved in H--3740, 19 November 1956.

LIFEAT has been run since its inception without liaison and no plans now exist to change this arrangement.

Over the past 6 years and 3 months LIFEAT has expanded from coverage of one (1) line to average of an average of atout twenty-four (24) lines, each being covered 24 hours per day. In all, over 40,000 pages of documentary information-on-prime-station targets has thus been obtained from this operation.

4. Reference

H-3740 19 Hoverber 1956, contains the last renewal of this project.

a. This project has been one of the outstanding KUARK operations in the world. Certain elements at Headquarters recognize this. Chief, SR/CE states to this station during his visit in January 1957 that this was the only "LIFLAT-type" operation which was wholly KUBARK's and he said it vas

the best such operation. From Mexico has, it is shown that (unless something has developed very recently) is the best operation of its kind which KUSA has.

b. Headquarters has stated:

1. In DIR-03195 of 18 Feb. 1957, WIHS commands Station prompt and effective coverage and handling this case;
2. In DIR-09958 of 29 March 1957, "Good work";
3. In DIR-11936 of 12 April 1957, "ODULVI and we(as) are most gratified by initiative and success your coverage".

All of these referred to LIFEAT coverages.

c. The Director has personally commended the Station officer for his work in one line's coverage in this operation; and has orally stated to COS, Mexico that this is an excellent operation.

5. Objectives

To carry out this Station's obligations in conformity with its Related Mission Directive, through technical surveillance operations. The product from this operation is coordinated with other Station operations, with especial attention to Soviet, Polish and Czech activities.

6. Targets

Primary targets covered in this operation are:

*   Soviet Embassy and residences of Soviet officials;
*   Czech Legation;
*   Polish Legation; and
*   Alfred Kaufmann.(and Martha Dodd) STIU.

Secondary targets are:

*   Soviet, Polish and Czech agents;
*   Mexican and foreign Communists; and

c. To recruit, train and administer such agents as the project requires;

d. To issue such reports as are deemed necessary, based on material acquired from the project;

e. To coordinate information obtained from the project with other Station operations;

and f. To provide EUIOT with operational information and reports on experience obtained from the project.

8. Coordination

LIFEAT information is very closely coordinated with all other operations at this Station but does not require operational coordination with any other area. However, when the project yields information of interest to other areas, these areas are informed.

10. Operational Clearances.

Of Item 9.

11. Cover

a. Cover for the case officers noted in 9a, diplomatic or comercial (unofficial) see 9 a.

b. Set forth below is a discussion of the cover of the non-diplomatic personnel in the operation.

1. David L. WESIED: Partner in small family-run machinery business. His Mexican documentation is complete and legitimate.

2. Ralph RAFAELI: Fully documented employee of LIFROCK, who has in the past provided similar cover for undercover agents.

3. LIEMATER: His natural cover is of employee of the local telephone company, which he has been for a number of years.

4. LIEMATER-1: Enjoys natural cover as a telephone company employee.

5. LIEMATER-2: Enjoys natural cover as telephone employee.

6. LIMESTONE-1: She is an elderly person and hence can logically have income from family estate. Does not attract attention.

7. LIMESTONE-2: Brother of LIMESTONE-1 and resides with her. Is elderly and can pass as a poor relative and retainer.

8. LIMESTONE-3: Has been engaged in obtaining small government contracts and moves in and out of various government offices. Unfortunately his cover is not really good and steps must be taken to improve it if he is to remain in our employ.

9. LIMESTONE-4: Elderly woman who has had large business enterprises in the past and who does not need to explain her source of income for this reason.

10. LIMESTONE-5: Father-in-law of LIMESTONE-3 and ostensibly dependent on him.

11. LIMESTONE-7: Widow of James O. McCALL, who was widely regarded as a man of means. Hence she ostensibly lives on his estate. This woman has a tendency to live beyond her means, however, and is a cause for anxiety.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 216

12. LD3S-C: Relative of LD3S-1. They reside together. This agent is a widew and ostensill lives on an inheritance.

13. LESTONE-9: Housewife.

14. LESTE-10: Housewife.

15. LEESTE-11: Housewife.

16. LETTIO: He is an architect and follows an alrost full time career in that business while his relatives manage the base.

17. LOITATO-3: Very elderly retired person who formerly had a large business and whose income therefore is not open to question.

18. LITATIO-7: Housewife.

19. LETTATIO-5: Accountant with a large fim. His wife (LEIT.TIG-6) handles most of the routine work he has core for the Station ir. the past.

20. LIQUATION: Businessman with office in the city. He spends a good deal of time on selling machinery while LIQUATIC -2 and LIQUATII-3 wind the base.

21. LIQUATION-1: Has been out of town working on a contract. Previously was a student and had adequate cover for part-tire work. When he returns to LITAT his cover will be similar to that of LIQUATION.

22. LIQUATTON-2: Housewife.

23. LIQUATICL-3: Elderly widow who resides part time with her children, hence not likely to arouse suspicion.

24. LIPSTICK-18: This agent's cover, that of plumber and electrician, is not satisfactory. It appears, however, that he may be put into another type of operation sometice this year.

25. LIPSTICK-35: Housewife.

26. LIPSTIC-37: Dependent relative of LIPSTICK-18.

27. Carol K. ZESEISTER: Housewife.

28. LILACE: Housewife

29. Alice N. CAILLETLAU: Housewife

30. Frances H. : Housewife.

31. Olivia H. : Retired woman residing with daughter and known to have independent income from retirement from former job.

12. Contact and Communication

Contact and communication between the case officers and the agents and undercover personnel in this operation is maintained in a clandestine manner in generally the same form as in previous years. Reference is made to CIA-4503, 9 May 1956, for a general description of this system, which appears to have been successful.

13. Control and Motivation

Reference is made to CIA-4503 under this heading.

14. Equipment and Other Support

It is believed that supplies of equipment for LIFEAT currently at the Station are sufficient to carry the operation through the calendar year 1957, but it is possible that simultaneous breakdown in quantities of the older equipment, dating from 1951 and in constant use since then, would necessitate the placing of separate orders for replacements.

15. Coordination

LIFEAT is coordinated with all other projects at this Station.

16. Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception in January 1951 and it is planned to continue it indefinitely.

MEMORANDUM FOR: FI/CPS - Projects Branch

SUBJECT: Amendment to Project LIFEAT

1. It is requested that project LIFEAT be amended to include the purchase of a LIFEAT/LIMERICK basehouse in the amount of $20,000. The lease on the present LIFEAT/LIMERICK base expires in April.

2. The LIFEAT/LIMERICK base is the principal base of operations covering Mexico City's number one priority targets. The location of this base must be moved since the lease on the present base cannot be renewed. Furthermore, a decision has been reached whereby new operational techniques will be initiated which will necessitate round-the-clock operations in the base by station cleared personnel in order to satisfactorily cover the targets. This will undoubtedly necessitate the acquisition of a more securely controlled base of operations. The station does not believe such a base can be acquired other than by purchasing the property indicated. However, every effort will be made to lease this property providing leasing arrangements can be made to meet the security requirements of the operation.

3. At present additional funds are not needed in the LIFEAT project to cover the purchase of a new basehouse. Should more funds be needed before the project expires, they will be requested at a later date.

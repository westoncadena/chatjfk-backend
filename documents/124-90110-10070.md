NOTE:

Subject is a commercial representative from Yugoslavia. Information was received from CIA that an individual with the same last name was a member of Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS). However, another source of CIA advised subject was not a member of YIS. CIA has learned that an individual believed to be the subject is being recalled to Yugoslavia, but this individual wishes to remain in the U. S. CIA desires verification of this information because if it is true CIA may wish to consider contacting subject in an effort to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia under control of CIA. Subject is supposed to return to Yugoslavia at end of April, 1963. Approach to subject by FBI is not recommended because New York informants said in March, 1963, subject is not engaged in intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance for approach in similar case.

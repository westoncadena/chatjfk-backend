1. DUSKIRT-2 HAS ASKED IF WE COULD OBTAIN FOR HIM THE CURRENT
   ADDRESS OF MANUEL ARTIME. D-2 WAS FRIEND AND COLLABORATOR OF
   ARTIME FROM 1959 UNTIL THEY LOST CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER IN 1968.
   WHEN D-2 FIRST CAME TO PERU HE CARRIED LETTER SIGNED BY ARTIME
   IDENTIFYING HIM AS ARTIME PERSONAL REP IN PERU.

2. D-2 WANTS TO CONTACT ARTIME TO ASK HIS HELP IN OBTAINING
   NICARAGUAN PASSPORT. HE CLAIMS ARTIME RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMOZA
   IS SUCH THAT ARTIME COULD OBTAIN FOR D-2 NICARAGUAN PASSPORT AND
   PERHAPS SOME TYPE OF HONORARY CONCUL DESIGNATION, D-2 WILL WRITE
   LETTER TO ARTIME EXPLAINING HIS SITUATION AND WILL ASK STATION
   TO POUCH LETTER TO MIAMI FOR MAILING THERE EITHER DIRECTLY TO
   ARTIME OR TO D-2 SISTER FOR HER TO DELIVER PERSONALLY TO ARTIME.

3. AS ABOVE INDICATES, D-2 REMAINS PREOCCUPIED WITH FACT HE
   DOES NOT POSSESS VALID PASSPORT. HE HAS TRIED NUMEROUS SCHEMES
   TO OBTAIN SAME WITHOUT SUCCESS. HE STRONGLY FEELS HE MUST HAVE
   DOCUMENTATION TO LEAVE PERU IF NECESSARY. HE WORRIES ABOUT

POSSIBILITY OF ONE DAY BEING ARRESTED, PERHAPS AS RESULT HIS BKHERALD ACTIVITY, AND DEPJATED TO CUBA BY LEFTIST PERUVIAN GOVT. HE ADMITS THAT HIS EXPERIENCES IN CUBA AFTER CASTRO'S TAKEOVER COLOR HIS PERCEPTION OF THE DANGER IN HIS CURRENT SITUATION BUT HE IS NOT WILLING TO REMAIN VULNERABLE TO SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT IN PERU. EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL OF COURSE NOT REASSURE HIM RE THE SITUATION HERE.

4. OTHER THAN ARTIME GAMBIT, ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES FOR OBTAINING PASSPORT WHICH REMAIN OPEN TU D-2 ARE PERUVIAN CITIZEN-SHIP OR GOING TO CUBAN EMBASSY AND ASKING THAT THEY RENEW HIS EXPIRED CUBAN PASSPORT. HE REJECTS IDEA PERUVIAN CITIZENSHIP, CLAIMING HE STILL PLANS EVENTUALLY RETURN TO LIVE IN UNITED STATES BUT ALSO BECAUSE HIS FEARS ABOUT ULTIMATE DESTINATION PERUVIAN REVOLUTION AND POSSIBILITY MARXIST DICTATORSHIP COMING TO PONER HERE. HE AND STATION ARE NATURALLY RELUCTANT HAVE HIM APPROACH CURS. THERE PROBABLY THICK FILE ON HIM IN HAVANA AND HE WOULD NOT HISH CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS PRESENCE HERE. HOWEVER THIS OPTION MUST BE EXAMINED AND THEREFORE WOULD BE HELPFUL IF HOS COULD PROVIDE INFO UN EXPERIENCE OTHER'S SUCH AS D-2, FORMERLY ACTIVE CASTRO OPPONENTS NOW IN EXILE IN COUNTRIES WHICH MAINTAIN

4. AMBIDDY-1 CONTACTED JAMES D. ZABOTH 4 MARCH, SAID HE CLOSING OUT ALL HIS STATIONKEEPERS IN NICARAGUA, DID NOT WANT TO ABANDON WEAPONS TO FALL INTO WRONG HANDS, NOR TO GIVE THEM TO NIC GOVT. GENERAL SOMOZA KNEW AMWORLD WAS LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESERVE EQUIPMENT AND WOULD KEEP ENOUGH WEAPONS FOR LOCAL SECURITY. HE DID NOT KNOW NUMBERS AND TYPES REMAINING. AMBIDDY-I ASKED IF WOFACT WISHED TO RECOVER WEAPONS, OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THEM IN OCEAN. ZABOTH, AMBIDDY-1 AND AMJAVA-4, WHO IN MANAGUA ON OTHER BUSINESS, VISITED BLUFF ISLAND 6 MARCH TO CHECK SITUATION. IF HQS WISHES RECOVER WEAPONS, MOST FEASIBLE METHOD IS BY AIR. A CARIBOU OR C-123 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD LAND ON BLUFF STRIP, LOAD WEAPONS AT NIGHT AND FLY THEM OUT NEXT MORNING. IF HQS DOES NOT WISH RECOVER WEAPONS, AMBIDDY-1 COULD BE TOLD TO MAKE OWN ARRANGEMENTS TO DUMP WEAPONS AT SEA.

5. DESPITE AMBIDDY-1 DESIRE NOT INFORM SOMOZA ABOUT ARMS CACHE, COS FEELS THAT SOMOZA SHOULD BE INFORMED IF

HQS DECISION IS THAT ARMS SHOULD BE RECOVERED. SOMOZA
COULD BE TOLD THAT "SOME EQUIPMENT" LEFT BEHIND BY AMWORLD.
GROUP NOW STORED AT BLUFF AND LNHARP WISHES RECOVER. BELIEVE
HE WOULD AGREE TO AIRCRAFT PICKUP AS PROPOSED ABOVE. IN
STATION OPINION BLACK RECOVERY WITHOUT SOMOZA KNOWLEDGE
TOO RISKY. STATION ALSO FEELS THESE WEAPONS SHOULD BE
REMOVED FROM CENTRAL AMERICA LEST THEY FALL INTO WRONG HANDS.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT : Eduardo SUAREZ-Rivas y Morales

Eduardo SUAREZ-Rivas Morales, born 8 January 1935, is a Cuban national and a son of former Cuban ex-Senator Eduardo SUAREZ Rivas. SUAREZ was arrested for counterrevolutionary activities in Cuba in the early 1960's and was released from prison and allowed to come to exile in the U. S. in 1962 with return of the ransomed 2506 Brigade members. He was involved in public relations for Manuel Artime's exile group, the Revolutionary Recovery Movement, in the mid-sixties. He did not work for CIA, and there is no record of any attempt by CIA to recruit him.

The formal Agency relation- ship with ARTIME was severed in January 1967. ARTIME"S Deputy in the MRR was Rafael Aurelio QUINTERO Ibarbia and the MRR Treasurer was Sixto R. MESA-Aloma.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manuel Artime

1. Artime was an INRA official in the Castro regime in 1959 but broke with it in late 1959 or early 1960 over a communist issue and was exfiltrated by CIA. He was the political representative for Brigade 2506 and was captured during the Bay of Pigs. He was sentenced to be executed but this was later commuted by Castro to life imprisonment. In 1962 Artime was released to the U.S. as part of a prisoner exchange.

2. From June 1963 through April 1965 Artine conducted paramilitary operations (Project AMWORLD) against Cuba under the political banner of his exiled group, Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR). The Project expenses during this period were approximately $7 million. The support was terminated effective 1 May 1965 but support for political operations was restored in June 1965 at the rate of $15,000 per month. This was scaled down to $5,000 a month in September 1965, to $3,000 a month in June 1966, and terminated on 31 December 1966. Artime accepted this termination gracefully in a meeting on 13 January 1967. That ended the formal operational relationship with Artime, although he maintained informal contact with CIA, most recently with Robert Shaw when Shaw was COS, Managua.

Those visits have stopped since early spring 1972.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : Dr. Manuel Artine Ruess

1. Dr. Manuel Artine Bucsa has been a close friend of mine since we first met in Nicaragua in late 1966 or early 1967. It was as a result of Artime's revelations at that time that we recovered several tons of ASORLD aras and munitions which had been secretly buried at El Bluff. I last saw Artime in Tegucigalpa in July or the first days of August 1972.

2. Artine's business activity has narrowed down pretty much to exporting neat from Central America and arranging its importation into the United States at "iani. Ilis principal partner abroad is General Anastasio Sonoza Debayle of Nicaragua. I am not sure with whom he deals in the U.S. although he has mentioned on a couple of occasions a business connection with Superstarted in with "Bebe have also heard Edgard Buttarri (not sure of this spelling) who, in turn, is Artime mention the Imited States Meat Company" or the "American Meat Company" (not sure which) as an importer of his Nicaraguan meats.

3. Artime was quite active during the past year trying to get a meat export business going in ilonduras. Acting in concert with Somoza, and using to sore extent the Honduran connections of Teofilo Omar Babun Franco (another close friend of mine), Artime was attempting to refurbish an idle neat pack- ing facility at Puerto Arturo on the north coast of Ilonduras near Tela. The principai motivating force in this Honduran venture was to have been General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano. After repeated attempts to per the business rolling, Artime threw מט his hands in disgust about July 1972 owing to Lopez' failure to carry through on the londuran end. Artime told me that Lopez was "crazy" and "abnormal" (Artime is a psychiatrist) and that

SECRET

he was going to advise his associates in Nicaragua and the Miami area to forget about doing business in Honduras.

4. Artime lives in Miami and commutes often to Managua, always flying on Lanica Airlines (owned by Soroza). Then in Managua he usually stays at the home of Jose Fernandez de la Torre (still another close friend of mine).

5. Artime said he would keep me supplied with Nicaraguan steaks during our stay in the U.S. and made me promise to get in touch with him after we got settled in. I have not yet done so. If you wish, using this pretext I can contact him and elicit more up-to-date information on his commercial activities.

6. It might also be added that Artime is a long-time friend of Howard Hunt.

A. SOMOZA SAID THAT ARTINE COULD TALK WITH SCHICK, BUT SCHOZA WISHED TO EXPLAIN HE CONSIDERS SCHICK AN INDEPENDENT AGENT AND NOT AN EXTENSION OF HIS (BONOZA'S) RULE. HE SAID SCHICK BY HIS OWN RIGHT HAS PRESTIGE, AND WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO BE A "PUPPET RULER". AS FAR AS SCHICK'S FUTURE PROGRAMS WERE CONCERNED, SOMOZA SAID SCHICK HIMSELF WOULD DISCUSS THIS WITH ARTIME;

B. SONOZA SAID NICARAGUA HAS GREAT INTEREST IN BETTERING ITS RELATIONS WITH LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS, AND AS AN EXAMPLE SINOLER: OUT VENEZUELAS

C. SOMOZA COMMENTED ON THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND MADE IT CLEAR HE HAS LITTLE USE FOR JUAN BOSCH Y, GAVING, HE SAID HE IS FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT BOSCH HAS MADE A PACT WITH THE COMUNISTS.

4. ON 23 MARCH ARTINE MET WITH PRESIDENT RENE SCHICK FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT TWO HOURS, SCHICK MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:

A. THE IMPORTANT TASK FOR NICARAGUA IS TO RID ITSELF OF THE "DICTATOR" TAG, SCHICK SAID THAT BY BRINGING THE OPPOSITION INTO THE GOVERNMENT, AND LETTING THE OPPOSITION SHR IN THE GOVERNMENT, HE IS CONVINCED THAT NICARAGUA CAN PROGRESS TOWARD A DEMOCRATIC LOVERSACENT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 84

C. SCHICK WISHES TO IMPROVE RELATIONS BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND COSTA RICA AS WELL AS WITH VENEZUELA. HE SAID HE WANTS TO CONCENTRATE HIS EFFORTS ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND THUS HELP ESTABLISH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMON MARKET.

D. SCHICK IS CERTAIN IN HIS OWN MIND THAT LUIS SOMOZA HAS NO INTENT OF RETURNING TO POLITICS, AND ADCED THAT HE, SCHICK, ASKED GENERAL "TACHO" SOMOZA TO STAY ON AS CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. HE EXPLAINED THIS AS GOOD POLITICS, SAYING SOMOZA'S PRESENCE WOULD KEEP THE MILITARY IN CHECK AND ALLOW TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING REFORMS. HE HOPED THAT ON THE EXPIRATION OF HIS, SCHICK'S, TERM OF OFFICE, NICARAGUA WILL HAVE PROGRESSED TO THE POINT WHERE SOMOZA'S PRESENCE WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY IN THE ARMED FORCES;

E. NICARAGUA, LIKE ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA IS DISPOSED TO HELP THE ANTI-CASTRO CAUSE CLANDESTINELY, BUT SCHICK ADDED THAT SUCH HELP IS CONDITIONED UPON THE IMPLIED APPROVAL OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. IF SUCH APPROVAL IS GIVEN ARTIME CAN COUNT ON NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT.

5. SUBSEQUENTLY, AS AN ADDITIONAL CONDITION, SCHICK SAID THAT IF PRESIDENT KENNEDY APPROVES, AN AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE MUST BE SENT TO CENTRAL AMERICA TO COORDINATE THIS EFFORT.

FROM:
Chief of Station, Managua

SUBJECT:
Information Received from AMBIDDY-1

REFERENCE: (A) HNMA-4315, 17 April 1969

(B) HNMA-4324, 1 May 1969

1. Attached (USC) for the information of Headquarters is a copy of a memorandum prepared for the LNPURE Chief on 12 May 1969. This memorandum sets forth information received that day by the COS from AMBIDDY-1 who is considering going into a dry dock venture in Corinto with Jose Maria ZELAYA, private secretary to President Somoza. ZELAYA has cabinet rank. He is believed by many to be pro-Communist although, as in the case of similar reports about Francisco J. LAINEZ, no real proof of these allegations seems to be produced.

2. When shown this memorandum, the LNPURE Chief said he thought it quite likely that ZELAYA is strongly anti-American as reported by AMBIDDY.

3. AMBIDDY says that for the first time he recently heard Somoza utter unfavorable words about the United States and AMBIDDY "wondered" to the COS if ZELAYA could be exerting some evil influence on Somoza.

4. The Station will seek to draw AMBIDDY out at length on this matter at an opportune time.

The Ambassador 12 May 1969

Political Attaché

Statements of Jose Maria "Chema" ZELAYA

1. On 12 May I was contacted by a close friend of mine who is engaged in negotiations with "Chema" ZELAYA which may lead to the two forming a business partnership. While my source is not normally a source of intelligence information, I have found him to be a good observer and to be reliable. He told me that ZELAYA told him the following at a meeting on 9 May.

2. The ROCKEFELLER visit is merely a political maneuver on the part of President NIXON to furnish an excuse if anything goes wrong in Latin America. It is preposterous to expect Governor ROCKEFELLER to learn anything about a country in twenty four hours. ROCKEFELLER will go back to the United States, make his report to NIXON, and then go about his normal duties. NIXON will adopt those recommendations regarding U.S. policy for Latin America that are agreeable to him, paying no attention to the rest. If anything goes wrong, NIXON can pin the blame on ROCKEFELLER. In this way he has a scapegoat and also has an opportunity to lessen the prestige of a potential political rival. do possible good can come from this mission.

3. ZELAYA said that he has managed to obtain the blessing (bendición) of the Catholic Church. Now he is working on the blessing of the American Ambassador. In this respect he has proposed setting up youth centers around the country-- places where youngsters can go to read good books, play ping pong, etc. -- and the American Ambassador is interested.

4. My friend is of the opinion that ZELAYA is strongly anti-American.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa

1. On 18 April I saw Subject again briefly and told him that I would appreciate an opportunity to talk to him alone. As he was about to leave town, he promised to contact me again on his next trip to Managua. He phoned me on 28 April. I picked him up that night and drove him up to my house where we had a long conversa-:tion over a couple of steaks and a good bottle of wine.

2. I told Subject that I had heard his name mentioned in connection with such unsavory activity as fomenting revolution in Panama and narcotics trafficking--from people who don't know him. My reply to any such dirty-mouthing is that Subject is a hyperactive type who keeps in contact with all sorts of people, some of whom may be involved in unsavory activity. This does not mean Subject is involved. Indeed, I was sure he was not.

3. The provocation yielded desired results and in the ensuing conversation Subject gave me a detailed explanation of his present activities and financial situation.

4. His business dealings are carried on under his company, known as Central South International, Inc. He is president and his wife is secretary. His business activity In Nicaragua consists of :

a. Sales of equipment to the National Guard

b. Sales of livestock (cows) to Nicaragua. These dealings are handled through Colonel Guillermo NOGUERA, the buyer at this end, Subject expects to expand this business to include sales to INFONAC--the National Development Commission.

Subject obtains the livestock from the Montura Ranch of Florida.

c. Sales of Florida real estate.
Subject is not licensed to make such sales in the U.S. but can sell to persons abroad. (About two years ago he was selling lots west of Miami near where a new airport is to be built.)

5. Subject is now involved--on this trip--in a deal with President SOMOZA to furnish well drilling and pumping equipment for an agricultural irrigation system. SOMOZA was approached by a British firm which somehow wangled a U.S.-guaranteed 5 1/2 percent loan to underwrite the same scheme. This low interest was better than Subject's contacts could obtain initially and it appeared that the contract would go to the British outfit. However, Subject's stateside partner, a South Carolina legislator (state level), who operates a business known as INTERGROW, managed to swing the same deal and was due in town on 29 April to talk with SOMOZA. SOMOZA told Subject he would give the business to Subject if he and his INTERGROW friend could equal the British offer. As of 28 April prospects for consumation of a deal locked good.

6. Subject is also trying to work out a deal with SOMOZA regarding export of Nicaraguan meat. Previous dealings with a man from S&W fell through when this chap tried to "go around" Subject by dealing direct with Nicaraguan meat exporters. At present Subject is dealing with SOMOZA to buy meat from CARNIC and IFAGAN to sell in Miami to the Northwestern Meat Company, owned by Elpidio NUNEZ. In return for his cooperation in the meat business, SOMOZA is to be given a 38% slice of the profits. The remainder would be split up as follows: 16% to Edgarde BUTTARI, 13% to Frank CONDOM, and 33% to Subject. SOMOZA is trying to figure out some way to get his bite without paying U.S. income taxes so the matter of spreading the profits is still up in the air. Central South International Inc. has an account at the Capital National Bank of Miami, Subject showed me an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $48,000 issued by this bank to be used for the meat export deal.

7. As for possible sales of cattle to INFONAC, Subject is working on a deal with SOMOZA which may involve as much as a million and a half dollars.

8. Subject lives on commissions. He is now in debt to the tune of $9,500 of which he owes $1,600 το American Express and $3,900 to SOMOZA. When he has been down and out three persons have helped him with handouts of money to tide him over. These are Sixto MESA, in the construction business in Miami; Jose Luis GONZALEZ, in the lumber business; and "Tacho" SOMOZA. Subject plans to pay back all three every cent they have given him. He considers these handouts as loans. He is now trying to consolidate his debts through a loan from Diners Club. He is paying on his home mortgage at a rate of 5 3/4 percent, quite low by present-day standards. Two Cuban Negro friends of many-years standing live with him at his home. They are taxi drivers and each pays $25 a week to help defray" household costs. One of these loyal retainers fired the first shot during the Pilon sugar mill raid pulled off by Subject's followers several years ago.

9. Contrary to popular belief, Subject does not own a piece of the Vizcaya restaurant in Miami although he could have been a partner had he made a $500 investment when the enterprise began. The owners are Oscar VILA, Aramis PIÑON, and the cook, named Tomás (lnu). VILA and PIÑON were with Subject in the Bay of Pigs invasion and both are old friends. VILA has been rumored involved in narcotics but Subject doesn't think he is. Some time ago the Miami Herald sent its lady gourmet reporter to do a story on the Vizcaya. She found it to her liking and wrote a favorable story but some unidentified character at the Herald told her that narcotics were pushed at the Vizcaya and that Subject was one of the owners. Publisher KNIGHT of the Herald had an investigation run before allowing the gourmet reporter's story to be printed. The restaurani was given a clean bill of health and the story was run.

10. One of the persons most prominently involved in blackening Subject's name is Rolando MASFERRER. Subject classifies him as the scum of Batista's Cuba. One gets the impression that Subject would be unhappy if MASFERRER, who Subject says has been involved in narcotics trafficking, were to say anything good about him.

11. Subject's only other possible connection with narcotics involves a report he gave to Mr. DREW of the FBI. This was as follows: Subject has a friend named Carlos ARMAS who is skipper of a shrimp boat the "Sea Cat". ARMAS lives at 1800 NW 34th Street, Miami. At sea in British waters (around some British island or cay in the Caribbean). ARMAS has "fraternized" with a Cuban shrimper "El Costero" captained by Antonio LOPEZ. LOPEZ has told ARMAS that his boat, "El Costero", often carries aboard a small, very fast speedboat. While anchored in British waters this speedboat, with a crew of 3, is put overboard with a "package" on board. It disappears only to return sometime later minus the package but with large quantities of money. It then refuels from "El Costero" and heads for Cuba on its own power. Subject and ARMAS think it probable that the package contains narcotics and that Fidel CASTRO is raising money this way. Mr. DREW of the FBI told Subject to tell his story to the Coast Guard. Subject did but the CG said they were not interested because the smuggling was taking place in British waters. As far as Subject knows nothing has ever been done about this matter.

12. Subject says that "politically" his program breaks down to:

a. Keeping about 200 men ("my action men") ready for action in case of a sudden change in Cuba or a "go ahead" on raids against Cuba.

b. Keeping on good terms with Edgardo BUTTARI and Frank CONDOM who are both on good terms with "Bebe" REBOZO who is in turn, an intimate friend of President NIXON. (Subject asked me not to discuss or report this owing to its political sensitivity. It would seem prudent not to accentuate this matter).

c. Keeping good relations with Nicaragua and Haiti for possible future operations against Cuba.

13. I asked Subject if he had any dealings with Colonel Angel ARAUZ of Panama in connection with efforts to cverthrow the government of Panama. He said that ARAUZ had tried to get him, Subject, to furnish arms, support, and influential

friends in the Miami area. Subject successfully avoided ARAUZ when he showed up in Miami. ARAUZ is now in Venezuela where his wife's family is well connected with the COPEI Party. Subject is not in contact with ARAUZ.

14. Throughout our conversation Subject appeared sincere and anxious to make the facts known. He repeatedly stressed his respect for our organization as he has in the past. I believe he was being forthright and honest. He promised to keep in touch.

REFERENCE: FBI Report of 30 January 1969

The Station has seen a copy of an FBI report of 30 January 1969, concerning AMBIDDY-1, which indicates, among other things, that AMBIDDY reportedly claimed to have arranged an interview With Mr. Richard NIXON at the time the latter was a presidential candidate. Since the content and tone of this FBI report differ somewhat from what the COS, Managua, has learned in direct talks with AMBIDDY-1, there is attached (USC) a memorandum from the COS setting forth observations resulting from meetings with AMBIDDY in Managua.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa

1. ARTIME comes to Managua frequently, always using LANICA Airlines and frequently flying over Cuba. He is aware of the possibility of a highjacking and says that he would never make it out of the Havana airport alive if the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him.

2. He explains his trips as legitimate business. One of his enterprises lies in obtaining fatigue uniforms, canteens, web gear, and similar equipment and supplies for the Nicaraguan National Guard. Another enterprise, in which he was involved a year or so ago, involved lumber and cabinet woods which he hoped to export from Nicaragua to the States. He dealt with a Nicaraguan businessman named MOLINA in this matter. It seems to have fallen through. At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME was trying to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in Germany here. I have heard no more about this. A more recent line is Nicaraguan beef for export to the States. He says that he has made contact with the top man of the S & W restaurants in the States. This man, after checking samples of Nicaraguan beef, says he will buy all he can get. The supplier at this end would be CARNIC, a meat packing enterprise owned by President SOMOZA. (There is no doubt ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may be stymied by the import quotas, especially since Nicaragua over-exported to the States in 1968 and had troubles as a result.)

3. ARTIME drops by to see me at my home often although not on every trip. His vidite to me have been less frequent of late. We have easy rapport. He knows who I represent.

He is usually accompanied by Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre,
Manager of Distribuidora Inter-Americana, S. A. "Pepe"
is a Cuban and a close friend of mine. He is ARTIME'S
closest friend in Nicaragua. ARTIME often stays at his
home. On a couple of occasions ARTIME has been by to
see me with another mutual Cuban friend, Primitivo
ABLANEDO, who used to live at El Bluff on the East Coast.
"El Gallego" ABLANEDO now lives in Managua and makes his
living renting out dump trucks and construction and hauling
equipment. On one occasion ARTIME came by with a Cuban I
believe was named VILA. Mirta PADRON, another mutual
Cuban friend (she teaches Spanish at the American Embassy)
tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in Miami but that
ARTIME has no connection with this enterprise. A couple
of times ARTIME has come by with Frank CONDOM, a short,
quiet, red-faced Cuban who owns some jewelry stores in
Miami. CONDOM is now pretty well-off financially and is
a good friend and business associate of "Bebe" REBOZO,
who, in turn, is a close friend of President NIXON. I
believe CONDOM and, perhaps REBOZO, may be involved in the
meat deal.

4. ARTIME always comes with sor-sone when he visits
   me--not because he feels need for a bodyguard as some
   suspect, but simply because he still doesn't know how to
   drive a car and I live some distance out of town. Our
   visits are pleasant, involve a scotch or two at most.
   The last two times ARTIME has not had anything to drink.
   We talk no operations or other such business. My personal
   views on dealing with CASTRO, especially on howwe should
   have dealt with him in the past, are rather hawkish and I
   think ARTIME finds these views pleasant to his ear although
   he is well aware that they are not "policy."

5. ARTIME told me some months ago--before the elections--
   of meeting with "Bebe" REBOZO. The meeting was arranged
   through CONDOM. ARTIME has not claimed to me to have met with
   Mr. NIXON either before or after he assumed the presidency.
   He has made it known, as is already well known, that REBOZO
   is close to the President. He has also speculated that
   REBOZO might have considerable say in formulation of the new

administration's Cuban policy. He expects this policy to be more hard-line out has not specifically said that RE3OZO has said this would be so. He recently told me that some of my ideas on enforcing the economic blockade had been passed on to REBOZO.

6. In response to my queries as to what direction the new Cuba policy might take, ARTIME said in March 1969 that he did not expect the NIXON administration to address itself to the Cuban problem before May of this year. Then he expects a concerted effort to make the economic blockade work. If that does not yield results, he expects that a go-ahead will be given for the resumption of Cuban exile raids against Cuba from non-U.S. bases. He hopes to be the man chosen to lead in this endeavor. Again, in response to my questions, he said that exiles could be trained in Nicaragua. He favors using Haiti as the actual base of operations, i.e., the raiding parties would leave from there. He mentioned having talked with President DUVALIER and indicated that he has DUVALIER's approval for such operations.

7. ARTIME said that operations against Cuba would be designed to knock out shipping and port facilities. He has not recently referred to his earlier invasion plan as outlined in MANAGUA 6752 of 23 October 1968.

8. ARTIME is still as charming as ever, lot's of fun to be around socially--full of jokes, anecdotes, etc. He has not lost faith, is one of the few of what have been termed elsewhere "the old exile hacks" who have not given up. He really does seem determined to play a leading role in unseating CASTRO. he is beginning to go to fat a bit. I saw him in a bathing suit not long ago and thought that he would do well to get into trim if he hopes to lead in any military operation.

9. ARTIME has never made any discernable efforts to pry secrets from me; indeed, he seems to have taken special pains not to do so. He is mature and quite objective--can see various facets to just about any problem. I believe it is well worthwhile maintaining encasional contact with him.

# DISPATCH

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET

TO: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

FROM: Chief of Station, WH/Miami

SUBJECT: Current Rumors in PBRMEN Exile Community

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:

1. As usual the first month of 1969 featured a large number of rumors making the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile community. While we normally tend to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they relate to GPVALIANT.

2. The first of these rumors deals with a new group which has presumably been formed for the purpose of trying to deal through GPVALIANT. Among those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos, Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari. This group reportedly meets every Thursday at different houses. The last meeting in January was held at the home of Lincoln Rodon. At this meeting Prio presumably stated that Butari was a better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando. The general consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT. The rumor mill has it that the group intends to pretend that it favors political and democratic solutions to the PBRUMEN problem but that they really seek armed intervention. In this same connection Father O'Farril has recently told AMPALM-4 that AMBIDDY-1 is once more connected with WOFIRM and that AMCORE-2 has joined him. The rumor mill says further that AMBIDDY-1 and AMCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit encouragement of the above group. According to AMPALM-4 O'Farril himself does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-1 and AMCORE-2 wanting to establish training camps. O'Farril feels that the solution AMBIDDY-1 is looking for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.

3. NIBALDA has picked up information quite similar to that learned through AMPALM-4. He also has reported the existence of this group and said that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy arms and equipment to overthrow AMTHUG-1. According to WIBALDA important members of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor, and Ortodoxos are involved even though these organizations themselves are not participating as groups in the movent.

4. Another rumor has it that AMOTEX-59 is also conspiring in plans for future arned action against PBRUMEN.

5. The above information is being forwarded strictly as unfounded and unconfirmed rumors. We are passing it along only because it represents another indication of what the exiles are expecting from GPVALIANT. We find the rumor concerning AMBIDDY-1 particularly interesting and suspect that it may be an outgrowth of the recent report we have received from ANCHALK-1 that AMBIDDY-1 has been contacted by ACSI.

# 26 - LA PRENSA 28 DE AGOSTO DE 1967

## Artime Invita a Revolución Cristiana

Hablando con intensa emoción ante un grupo de empresarios, empleados y obreros, el Dr. Manuel Artime hizo el martes por la noche una rápida revisión del drama de Cuba, invitando a evitar que la sociedad cristiana de Nicaragua enfrente el materialismo dialéctico del comunismo, con el "Materialismo práctico", igualmente destructor.

"No nos dejemos quitar la palabra revolución", proclamó Artime.

El jefe de la invasión de Bahía de Cochinos, que llegó a Nicaragua por décima vez desde el fracaso de la invasión, habló de manera independiente y si manifestó su liga con ningún movimiento, con ninguna agrupación.

Sin embargo, por la insistencia que hizo en citar constantemente las frases de Cristo como doctrina opuesta a la penetración comunista, el persistente cubano pareció estar hablando como uno de los seglares que la Iglesia Católica utiliza ahora, conforme las nuevas modas, para difundir su doctrina.

> Lo Eiso de manera, hormo

vitó a los cristianos a militar "no con tibleza", porque a los tibios es a los que Cristo dijo arrojar por la boca, prefiriendo a los fríos, o los calientes, en los casos extremos.

Después de exponer el pensamiento cristiano y los pasajes más hermosos e imperecederos de los Evangelios, el Dr. Artime expuso por qué en su opinión una sociedad está amenazada de la penetración comunista, cuando la afligen los siguientes males:

-Los religiosos "puros", que nunca entran en la política, porque dicen que la política es sucia y pueden contaminar su alma.

-Los demagogos que ofrecen al obrero sus derechos únicamente, y no sus deberes y al capitalista el derecho arrollador de su capital, pero no sus obligaciones.

-Los mercaderes que usan el templo, es decir, la Iglesia, exclusivamente para su propio beneficio y crean una religión de puertas para adentro, sin predicar la verdadera esencia del cristianismo ni ponerla en práctica.

Otros males que, según el Dr. Artime, predisponen para la instalación del comunismo, son:

-Los indiferentes, que rezan que cuando el peligro, auxíli dão putrircó con ellos.

-Los cristianos de caridad farisaica, que regalan 1.000 pesos, cargados de joyas, para salir en primera página en los periódicos.

-Los que están con Dios y con el diablo y predican una moral pública, pero tienen otra moral privada, que deja que desear.

-Los estériles, como la higuera bíblica, que no producen nada.

EL FRACASO Y EL FUTURO

Bajo continuas preguntas, el Dr. Artime analizó el fracaso de Bahía de Cochinos y explicó como un pueblo encarcelado horas antes por centenares de miles, no pudo responder al llamado de la revolución anti-comunista y la brigada de 1.100 hombres que atacaba tuvo que enfrentarse con 60.000 soldados protegidos por tanques y artillería.

"Y la protección aérea que hubiera dado el barco en nuestro favor, como la suplida", comentó Artime.

El combatiente de Cuba nos insistió en que "en la Cuba, exclusivamente se verá a derramarse sangre para liberar a Cuba", y que el ha sufrido lo que un sacerdote le predijo a él una vez como parte de su residencia después de haberse olvidado de Dios.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief, WH Division

FROM: Chief of Station, Managua

SUBJECT: Traces on Persons Mentioned in Letters from AMBIDDY-1

REFERENCE: HNMW-2005, 5 June 1967

ACTION: None, For Your Information

1. In reply to the request for traces in Paragraph 2 of reference, James D. ZABOTH personally conducted name checks at SAC and OSN records and offices. There were no SAC traces on any of the persons listed. OSN traces follow:

a. Rodolfo JEREZ Suarez
DOB: 7 September 1917
Owner of Venus Shirt Company in Managua;
brother of Julio JEREZ Suarez, a Cuban-oriented
Communist who has been active in the FSLN and
has been in exile in Costa Rica. Rodolfo
JEREZ was found guilty by a board of investi-
gation on 30 July 1959 of promoting and direct-
ing the subversive movement "Accion Civica"
in support of armed invasion against the Govern-
ment of Nicaragua. (Managua Station records
indicate he was arrested 29 May and released
on 17 July 1959.) OSN maintained a record of
his travel to Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador,
and the United States between 1959 and 1963.
On 27 January 1960 he was reported to be second
in command of terrorism in Managua for "Accion
Civica", the internal front of a revolutionary
group. On 10 November 1960 he was reported to
be hiding arms in Managua, along with others in
a revolutionary group. On 13 November 1960,

continued.....


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 157

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

he was reported to be trying to organize a commercial strike in Leon and Managua. He was arrested in November 1960 as a known conspirator in an attempted revolution and for having been involved in the clandestine movement of revolutionaries across the Costa Rican border.

b. Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre

On 2 March 1962 a report said he was a Cuban refugee who talks anti-Communist but was actually sent to Nicaragua to make Communist propaganda. On 8 May 1965 he vouched for the entry into Nicaragua of Jesus FERNANDEZ Suarez, a Cuban (no OSN or Station traces). (Note: FERNANDEZ is known personally to ZABOTH and to the Chief of Station, whose opinions about him are that he is a Cuban businessman who is both anti-Communist and anti-Castro because of the loss of his business interests in Cuba. His principal business in Cuba involved distribution of the products of Procter and Gamble, the soap and chemical company. He is now manager of Distribuidora Inter-Americana S.A., an import/export and distribution firm in Managua.) On 18 January 1967 the Guatemalan Security Service requested traces on the subject, along with a list of other Cubans. No reason for the request was given to OSN.

c. Orlando CASTRILLO S., Bachiller

On 20 November 1965 he wrote a letter to La Prensa, the opposition newspaper in Managua, asking them for 30,000 copies of an anti-SOMOZA caricature in order to sell them and raise funds for university student grants.

d. German ARELLANO

On 17 January 1967 a report said he had bought $5,000 worth of arms in Miami for illegal shipment to Nicaragua, and they had been confiscated by authorities at Miami. (Station card shows subject's name as German ARELLANO Morales. See JMWAVE-5188, 20 January 1967 and JMWAVE-5247, 24 January 1967 for further details of this report.)

2. There are no OSN, SAC or Station traces on the other persons mentioned in letter number 2 of the reference.

3. Both ZABOTH and the Chief of Station have discussed with AMBIDDY-1 the "intelligence net" mentioned by the reference. The stated Station position was "we are happy to maintain contact with you and to discuss this matter from time to time on an informal and personal basis, but the policy of our organization is that we do not engage in intelligence activities in a friendly country except in coordination with the local government. Therefore, even though you assure us that General SOMOZA knows and approves this activity, we would have to have a direct request from him before we could cooperate with you in any kind of an official capacity." This appears to have sufficied to keep our lines open to those involved without committing us to do anything more than listen.

2. Incidentally, my secretary Eugenio Claude spoke with a friend named Pedro Pino who lives at 1132 W 71 St., Hialeah, Florida, 33012. PINO told him that his friend, Lourdes BELLO, who lives at 1124 West 71 Pl., Hialeah, Florida and who has lived there for only a short while, has received correspondence which must have been for the previous tenant at that address. This correspondence came from Cuba and consisted of subversive propaganda. All the correspondence is addressed to:

![address of cuban propaganda]

The sender of this correspondence appears as:

![sender of correspondence of propaganda to Carlos Gonzalez]

Being tht I was out and that my secretary knows Rafael LLANEZ who works for Sangenis who works for you, gave him this correspondence so that he might sent it to you, I have sent you the propaganda which so far has arrived,

3. I have received from my father, in Cuba, a note with a pédéage in which he tells me that he intends to leave Cuba under a false name. His message is very clear:

I am trying to arrange that the "nucleus" of Gonzalito Penaranda leaves soon. NUMBER IS 117838,

Of course, he is referring to the Airlift from Habana to Miami. I ask you to inform me if you can do anything in this regard as I think it is the last chance my parents have of leaving.

4. Please tell me if it is certain that Fidel intends to go to EXPO 67 in Canada for the 26 of July as it has been rumored. If he is going, I would like to know if Commander Vallejo will go with him as his chief doctor. When I was imprisoned, I received nany messages from Vallejo telling me that he was not a Communist and never would change.

Letters from AMBIDDY-1

Action: See Para. 2.

1. Forwarded in split transmission are two letters from AMBIDDY-1 to his Headquarters Case Officer, which contain a number of interesting items concerning Nicaragua, some of which probably have already been discussed with Station officers. Paragraph 6 of HNMW-2010 of 29 May 1967 also contains pertinent extracts from another of AMBIDDY-l's letters.

2. We are initiating Headquarters traces on the individuals mentioned as comprising the intelligence net of letter No. 2. You will be advised of the results. We would appreciate Station traces on these persons.

Miami, 23 May 1967

Dear Jim:

I have delayed the trip to Nicaragua until Wednesday the 24th or Thursday the 25th, because the Nat Harrison Company, which is financing my trip, wants me to take some documents to Managua.

I am sending you the signed reciept herewith.

It looks like Roberto (our friend over there) wants Ablanedo to stay on for a complete month in Nicaragua. If it is going to be that way then I will need the money for this month also. If he stays it is because Roberto orders him, and if Roberto orders him to stay, then Roberto should pay.'

I inform you of the following:

1.  The manner used to focus the case of Felipe Rivero is absurd. They are converting him into a hero and a martyr. In order "Not to be a slave of Yankee Imperialism!" even I had to make declarations protesting the inprisonment of Felipe Rivero, although I clearly stated ay discrepancy against his ideology and rincipals.

Boch, the one from VIRR, is taking the anti-North American campaign and turning his hate toward the United States on this problem.

They could have taken Felipe Rivero out of the Waited States without informing anyone, and then they could have informed the people that he was already in another country. Or they could


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

-2-

have started a campaign to discredit him, like the one the Miami Herald started against me at first. But they should never have done/like they did. Another mistake is the public judgement which they are going to give him. Because of that judgement he is going to win more popularity and is going to rut the United States in a bad situation.

2. On this trip I am going to see if I can do something about the solidarity of the Central American countries with Venezuela in order to see if anything concrete comes up.

3. I have gotten reports from Cuba that in Bahia Honda they are constructing a subterranean rocket base. I am going to get more reports.

4. In Nicaragua there is a man, Allan Gross Quiros, (chemistry professor at the University of Leon and recently named to be a professor in Managua also, who was in East Germany and Russia for ten months) He returned to Nicaragua 1 - 15 April, passing through New York. He spoke with a man named "dayo" for a long time on the telephone. In his conversation with this man he told him (Rayo) that he had "taken a flight" from New York to Chicago where he spoke with "the person whom he had to speak to."

Allan Gross Quiros was in Leon and Masaya on the days in which the markets of Leon and Masaya were burned.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 185

-3-

He (Allan Gross Quiros) has written two letters to this address:

Herr Hubert Torres

75 Karlsonhe

Stephanienstrasse 29, Federal Republic of Germany

I am trying to investigate several addresses in the Uited States where he writes. These are reports from "Pepe" Fernandez.

5. In Honduras there is a young man whose surname is KEANEVER, who is from Honduras and the nephew of Ricardo Zuniga, the Presidential Counsellor. WEANEVER was in Cuba taking training, and in conversations with other young men he said that he hoped to go through Nicaragua. Presently he is in Honduras.

6. It is suspected that guerrilla training is taking place in Chinandega. I will go to that zone on this trip.

Ignacio

(read the back)

P.S. I forgot to tell you that Allan Gross Quiros always carries an "executive bag" which he will not 1st loose for one moment. He is an inseparable companion of ARAGON and Lillian Garcia, who are both Communists at the University of Leon.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 186

Some money from the University of Leon supports the subversion. There are "Phantom job positions"; that is to say duties which no one carries out and which receive high salaries. This money goes to the ranks of subversion.

Dear Manolo,

Enclosed you will find a check. Please date and sign the receipt and return it to me.

I have found your recent correspondence very interesting and hope you will continue to write me whenever you have an opportunity.

If you run across any information of interest concerning officials at Expo 67 or those planning to attend the Pan American games in Winnipeg, I would appreciate receiving it.

I hope we can get together one of these days--in the meantime good luck in all of your endeavors.

Support for Dependents of Operational Personnel

FOR YOUR INFORMATION

REFERENCE: HHMA 3798, dated 28 March 1967

1. When Wallace A. GROWERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January 1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation. AMBIDDY/1 discussed in detail reference dependents who had been receiving financial assistance from AMWORLD funds and requested that GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial assistance following termination of their AMWORLD monthly support payments. An investigation was conducted by both JEHAVE and Headquarters to determine if the agents named by AMBIDDY/1 have been employed by WOFACT in order to determine what, if any, obligation might exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents. The results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to reference dependents, are summarised below for Station Managua information.

(IDEN A) Subject was a WOFACT agent under prior contract. His MC provided payment of his $350 monthly salary to his dependent parents for two years following possible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission. After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received his regular monthly salary until 28 June 1963. At that time Headquarters decided to liquidate the remaining balance of $6400 and paid this amount in a lump sum to the parents. Headquarters considers that all legal and moral obligations have been discharged and is not inclined to assume any further financial obligations to the parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently unaware that the parents have received approximately $10,000 from WOFACT.

(IDEN B) Although IDEM C, the husband of IDEN B, vas never directly caployed by SOFACT, IDEN B receives $175 per wenth as a copendont ARROES/BARTYES widow under the ANBUD program and has been paid a total of $10,850 from March 1962 to date through the JUFAYE/ANDUD cover mechanisa. resumably AMBIDDY/1 is unavare that this dependent has been receiving regular ANBUD assistance in addition to the $123 por month received from AMORLD funds.

(IDEN D) ANBIDDY/1 provided GROWERY with the complete name and details of the activities of IDEM D's busta prior to his arrest and subsequent 6-30 year pri- son sentence. With this information traces vore run on Subject with negative results. Since neither JIWAVE mor Bendquarters records produced any evidence Subject had ever boen & VORACT employee, no obligation exists to provide financial assistance to IDE в.

2. Although reference indicates the discussion between Janes D. RABOTH and Ernest A. LUSBY took place after AMBIDDY/1's conver- sation with GROWERY in January, it is not clear when, or by whon, the subject was originally brought to ZABOTH's attention. If AMBIDDY/1 vas the source of ZABOTH's information it is noteworthy that he apparently neglected to mention his prior detailed dis- cussion with GROWERY.

3. Under the circumstances, it is not possible for Bead- quarters to the any action to provide support to these individuals.

MIAMI, 24 April 1967

Dear Jim,

Pardon my lateness in writing to you but I have had to face many problems and I wanted to be calm when I wrote to you.

I was at Luis Somoza's funeral and I think that I made a good impression. I am at present more worried than I was before, but not for my future, because Tacho is a very good friend of mine and Luis was not. I am worried about Nicaragua's destiny. Let us not forget that Nicaragua is the most solid pillar of Central America.

1-Lainos grew closer to Tacho during the funeral. Laines took practically all the load of the funeral arrangements upon himself.

2-Many of the good men who gave the Somoza's advice were intimate friends of Luis and they are afraid of coming to Tacho in order to give him advice.

3-The Communists are aware of this and they are also aware of the fact that Tacho is even more violent than Luis, therefore, they take advantage of the situation to provoke Tacho, thereby hoping that without Luis's advisors and possibly with the "bad advice" of "an infiltrator" in Tacho's circle of friends/to rule his government with an iron hand, which is just what the Communists want from him.

4-I think that Tacho has grown much closer to me and I will try to do everything possible to see that he keeps calm.

5-There is no doubt about the fact that the Communists have brought in a great quantity of weapons into Nicaragua. The weapons have not been found, in spite of the investigations by the Security Corps; even General Montiel recognizes this.

6-I think that there is discontent in the young officer's ranks because of the low salaries which the officials, sub-officials and enlisted men receive. This is not a problem at the present


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 195

but it could develop into a problem, if the Communists exploit it skillfully.

7-I also think that the Security Corps which continues to function under the orders of Montiel, who is also chief of Staff and also a merchant, loses all its efficiency because of the fact that Montiel cannot dedicate sufficient time to the Corps and as a result leaves its direction to Captain Willop, who I think is entirely incompetent for the job.

8-I think that the only good thing that panorama has is the loyalty of General Somoza's military troops, for I honestly do not trust some of the high officials.

9-Jose Fernandes made the contact with the Nicaraguan girl who received the proposition to study on a scholarship in Russia, at the Patricio Lumumba University, and she is willing to collaborate with us. I gave the contact to Carlos.

10-According to reports from Pepe Fernandes the "comrades" are going to try to intensify their "infiltrative job" in the Nicaraguan departmentsEXX of Education and Agrarian reform.

The following is expected after 2 May, the day on which Tacho is sworn in: sabotage, terrorism, and kidnappings. Provocations!

11-I sincerely think, and excuse me, that the United States should now, due to the psychological state in which Tacho is in, demonstrate that they have confidence in him XXHN and in the success of his Government. He is grateful to the United States for the help which the United States sent to his so that he could save his brother, therefore take advantage of this.

12-According to the comments which I heard in Tacho's close circles (Col. Sanchez from Lanica, Gen. Camilo Gonzalez, etc), Sevilla Sacasa is not in very good standing with Tacho. I think that Washington should become friendly with Tacho in a direct manner.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 196

13-Camilo Gonzalez's son spoke to me and told me that he had to see me later (I do not know when) in order to inform me about a group of Guatemalan Officials who are planning a coup d'etat against Mendez Montenegro and they want my help. When I know something concrete about this I will tell you. I have also heard rumors from Teo Carrasco (a painter, who is the brother XXX of General Peralta's paramour) that Peralta is "in something also." When I find out something concrete about these reports I will send it to XXN you and let you know.

14-I am going to Nicaragua for the swearing in ceremonies. I am trying to get free tickets to fly on Lanica. As soon as I see something of interest I will let you know.

P.S. Do not forget about Don Manuel Guillot.

Querido Jim:

Perdona la demora en la carta, pero he tenido muchos problemas a los cuales hacerles frente, y quería tener tranquilidad para escribirte.

Estuve en los funerales de Luis Somoza, y creo que causé buena impresión. Pero ahora est, más preocupado que antes pesar de que mi gran amigo es Tacho y no Luis,pero mi preocupación no es por mi futuro, sino por el destino de Nicaragua. No olvidemos que Nicaragua es el puntal más sólido de Centro-América.

1-Lainez logró hacercarse más a Tacho durante este proceso Practicamen- te fué el hombre que llevó todo el peso de los funerales.

2-Muchos de los buenos consejeros que tenían los Somoza, estaban intimamente ligados a Luis, y le temen scarcarse al Tacho Para darle consejos.

3-Los Comunistas son conscientes de ésto y de que Tacho es un hombre más violento que Luis, por lo tanto se aprestan a provocar al Tacho para que éste, sin los consejeros de Luis y posiblemente con los "malos consejos" de "algún infiltrado" en el circulo de Tacho, unido al caracter violento del Tacho, lleve su gobierno a una mano dura que los comunistas desean en Nicaragua.

4-Creo que Tacho se ha acercado mucho más a mi después de éste proceso y yo trataré de hacer todo lo humanamente posible para que vaya por camincs de tranquilidad.

5-No hay dudas de que los comunistas han logrado meter en Nicaragua una gran cantidad de armas, que no han aparecido a pesar de las pesquisas de los Cuerpos de Seguridadzésto lo reconoce el mismo Geral Montiel.

6-Creo que hay un leve desagrado en las filas de los oficiales jóvenes, por el salario tan bajo que reciben los oficiales, sub-oficiales y clases. Por el momento esto no es problema pero puede ser problema si el comunismo lo explotabilmente.

7-Creo además quez el Cuerpo de Seguridad, al seguir bajo el Mando de Montiel, que además es efe de Estado Mayor y además es Comarciante, pierde toda su eficacia, ya que Montiel no puede dedicarle el tiempo necesario y el Cuerpo es dirigido por el Capitán Willop,al cual considero completamente inepto para el cargo.

8-Creo que la única cosa buena que tiene el panorama,es la lealtad de la tropa militar al General Somoza, pues, honestamente desconfío hasta de algunos altos oficiales.

9-José Fernández logró el contacto con una muchacha nicaragüense que he recibido una proposición de estudio (becada) en Rusia, en la Universidad Patricio Lumumba, y está dispuesta a colaborar con nosotros. Yo le di el contacto a Carlos.

10-Según informes de Pepe Fernández, los "camarades" van a tratar de aumentar su intensidad de "trabejo infiltrativo" en los departamentos nicaragüenses de EDUCACIÓN Y REFORMA AGRARIA.

También se esperan:sabotage, terrorismo y secuestros después del día 2 do Mayo, toma de posesión de Tacho. Provocacionesl

11-Creo sinceramente, y perdónenme, que los Estados Unidos deben shore, dado el estado psicológico del Tacho, demostrarle que tienen confianza en 61 y en los logros de su Gobierno. Aprovechen que él es-tá agradecido por todos los recursos que Estados Unidos mandó para salvar al hermano.

12-Según comentarios que oí en circulos muy allegados al Tacho(Coronel Sánchez el de Lanica, General Camilo González etc) Sevilla Sacasa no está muy bien parado con el Tacho Creo que Washington debe intimar más directamente con Tacho.

13-El. hijo de Camilo González me habló de que tenía que verme luego (no sé cuando) pa. a informarme de un grupo d Oficiales Guatemaltecos, que están preparando un golpe de Estado contra Mendez Monte-negro y quieren mi ayuda. Cuando sepa algo concreto se los mandaré a decir. También he oido rumores de Teo Carrasco (pintor hermano de la querida del General Peralta) de que Peralta está "en algo también". Cuando concrete más los informes se los enviaré.

14-Voy a Nicaragua para la toma de posesión, estoy consiguiendo boletos gratis para volar en Lanica. Tan pronto vea algo de interés se los comunicaré.

MIAMI, 3 April 1967

Dear Jim,

Pardon my lateness in writing, but I have had to run around a lot. The fundamental subjects which I wished to discuss are:

1.  I was displeased when our Nicaraguan friend discussed the subject of the implements which we had in Blueffield with General Somoza before I had discussed anything with him (Genral Somoza); above all without even consulting with me before he went ahead and did it, this put me in a difficult position with the Government. This is what I discussed with: Carlos:

(a) The company will help me get him out (b) I will tell Somoza that he belongs to me (c) I move them to another place which is less accessible. He agreed with me on consulting with the company, and the answer he gave to (b) was that he planted the "other friend" in with Somoza, and nothing else was said. Thank God that I did well on that job, and I did pass some unpleasant moments.

2. During Somozas' stay in the USA I have seen him frequently and I have taken American investors, who wish to put their capital to work in Nicaragua, to see him. We have conversed copiously about his projects. He wants to do the following: Turn over his power when his mandate is terminated. Raise the standard of living for the Nicaraguans. Give the

farmers the chance to take their products to big markets, through the construction of highways, silos to store grains and favorable legislation for the small farmers. The only thing that worries me is the extraordinary influence that "Che Lainez" has on him in economics. There are diverse comentaries about this individual on whether he is a member of the Communist Party or not; but the truth is (I know him personally) that he is a social outcast, bitter, very intelligent and very ambitious. Furthermore, when he tries to please someone he acts like their servant. If he is not a Communist then he is easy material for the Communists.

3. Somoza has promised me to continue to move the subject of Cuba in the international spheres, and in his appearance in "Meet the Press" he has already done it.

There is a "GARCIA" who is a syndicate leader of the ?wharfs? of New York, who through Adolfo Jimenez told me about a new invasion that was planned for Haiti, directed by me and leaving from Nicaragua. I responded negatively. It seems that they spoke with others about the project and a rumor started which said that I was preparing an invasion of Haiti from Nicaragua; I then went to see the Haitian consul in Miami to make it clear to him and his Government that I was not an adventurer, and that neither I nor the Nicaraguan Government had the slightest intention of interfering with Duvalier.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

-3-

The consul has now told is that Duvalier wishes to speak with me. I told him that I would be glad to speak with him when he wished and when the interview would be kept secret. I think that this interview could be useful, for I have found that the Haitian Government has a grudge against the U.S. I do not know what we will speak about but I think that I can get some good information for you (plural).

5. I think that we can expect violent revolts in Nicaragua, in Panama, in Guatemala, and in Honduras (the opposition is in possession of many arms that have not been found yet). This breakout of guerrilla warfare in Bolivia and Brasil demonstrates Fidel's desperate strategy in trying to start other Vietnams in America whether or not Russia is in agreement.

I think that the dismissal of Raul Castro and Vilma Espin from the key posts in Cuban Communism can cause an internal revolt in disagreement between Cuban Communist elements and we have to be on alert in order to take advantage of the event so that it will not surprise as the "bloody rebellion and cultural revolution of China" surprised us.

I believe that propaganda for CUBA should be centered on planting distrust in the Armed Forces and on making Fidel Castro appear unstable as a person. If he has not even been faithful to his own "brother," then what can the rest of them expect if they are not even his relatives? I think that we should emphasize the fundamental part that Roul and Vilma had in consolidation of Castroism and its rise to power.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 203

I do not think that Almeida has the control nor the influence over the Army that Raul had, and therefore a conspiracy and revolt of the Armed Forces is easier. There is no doubt that Fidel is assigning key posts to men and women who are his personal friends, without regard to whether they are good or bad Communists. This is going to bring about problems with the old guard of the Communist Party and with the people in the new guard who have been hastily taught Fidel's doctrine but have received Communist indoctrination (many of them sympathize with Raul).

It seems that Russia is very displeased with Fidel and it would not surprise me if Russia would try to cause an attack on him; we should insinuate this in the propaganda against Castro for we know that his paranoic mentality and his disgust for Russia would most emphatically make him start to purify and take reprisals against Moscow's unconditional demands; an atmosphere of tension would then be created between Russia and Fidel.

The divorce of the Latin American Communist Parties from their obedience to Moscow, seems to be a feeling of disgust for Russia.

I have 200 men ready, who upon receiving weapons, can be taken to Cuba in caly 48 hours, in case of a revolt. Their mission would be to overtake a town with a radio station in order to take advantage of the chaos of the revelt and establish a military Government that would be immediately recognized by a number of Latin American Governments and

some European Country.

6. Ablanedo tells me in a letter that ROBERTO, the *friend" from Nicaragua, has told him that he cannot go to Blueffield until **everything** is taken out. That will take part of this month which means that apart from the subsidy that I have given him for last month I will have to give him this month's also. Could the company help me with that? The subsidy comes to $275.00 monthly. That is what I give to his family in Miami. This does not include what he is spending in Blueffield.

7. Tell me if at last you know anything about the request that I made for Mr. Manuel Guillot, for the Fundora widow and for the poor, deaf lady whose husband is in prison.

That's all for now, if there is anything new to tell you I will inform you of it.

Querido Jin:

Perdona la demora en escribir,pero he tenido que correr mucho. Los temas fundamentales que quería tratarles son:

1-Me disgusté cuando vuestro amigo de Nicaragua le trató el tema al General Somoza antes que yo, de los" implementos" que teníamos en Blueffield; sobre todo, sin haberlo consultado antes conmigo ya que eso me colocaba en una posición difícil con el Gobierno. Lo que yo traté con Carlos fué: a)La compañía me ayuda a sacarlo b)Yo se lo planteo a Somoza como cosa mia c) Los mudo de lugar a otro más inaccesible. El quedó conmigo en consultar con la Comapañía y la respuesta fué que el otro "amigo" se.. planted a Somoza sin habiar nada más. Gracias a Dios pude salir bien del asunto, pero pasé mi momento desagradable.

2-Durante la estancia de Somoza en USA le he visto frecuentemente y le he llevado inversionistas americanos que desean poner a trabajar su capital en Nicaragua. Hemos conversado largamente de sus proyectos. Piensa: Entregar el poder cuando termine su mandato. Elevar el nivel de vida del pueblo nicaragüense, Hacer asequible al campesino el sacar sus productos a los grandes mercados, mediante la construcción de carreteres, silos para almacenar gres y una legislación favorable a los pequeños productores.

Lo único que me preocupa,es la extraordinaria influencia que en materia económica, tiene sobre él el "Che Lainez",Sobre este individuo hay comentarios muy diversos sobre si pertenece al partido comunista o no; pero lo cierto es (lo conozco personalmente) que se trata de un recentido social, amargado muy inteligente y muy ambicioso. Además, cuando trata de agradar a alguien,llera hasta al" servilismo". Si no es comunise be,es materia fácil para el comunismo.

3- Somoza me ha prometido continuar moviendo el asunto Juba en les esferasa internacionales,y en la comparescencia en "meet the press" ya lo hizo.

4- Hay un tal"GARCIA"que es lider sindical de los muelles de New York, que a través de Adolfo Jiménez, me planted el asunto de una nueva invasión

a Haiti, dirigida por mi y saliendo desde Nicaragua. Yo respondí que nó.

Como parece que ellos hablaron a otra gente del proyecto y se empezó a rumorar en Miami que yo preparaba una invasión a Haiti desde Nicaragua; fui a ver al cónsulde Haiti en Miami para que le aclarara a su Gobierno que yo no era un aventurero, y que ni yo,ni el Gobierno Nicaraguense teníamos la más leve intención de meternos con Duvalier.

El Consul, después de eso me ha dicho que Duvalier quiere hablar conmigo.

Yo le dije que yo estaba dispuesto a hablar con él siempre y cuando la entrevista fuera secreta.

Creo que esta entrevista puede ser útil, pues he descubierto en el Gobierno Haitiano, un resentimiento contra los Estados Unidos. No sé cual será el tema que iremos a tratar, pero creo que puedo sacar buena información para Ustedes.

5-Creo que hay que erar revueltas violentas e Nicaragua (hay muchas armas en poder de la oposición que no han sido encontradas); en Panamá, en Guatemala y en Honduras.

Este brote guerrillero en Bolivia y Brasil, luce una estrategia desesperada de Fidel, de conseguir en América varios "Viet-Nam", quiera o no quiera Rusia.

Creo que la separación de Raúl Castro y Vilma Espín de los cuadros claves del comunismo cubano, puede traer como consecuencia una revuelta interna por pugna entre factores comunistas cubanos, y tenemos que estar alerta para aprovechar al máximum los scontecimientos y que no nos agarre de sorpresa somo la "sangrienta revolución cultural china y la rebelión".

Creo que la propaganda para CUBA debe basarse en sembrar dentro de les Fuerzas Armadas la desconfianza y la vacilasión hacia Fidel Castro en persona, que no le ha sido leal ni a su "hermeno", luego Qué pueden esperar los demás que ni siquiera son familiares de ál? Crec que se debia recalcar el papel fundamental qu Reul y Vilma tuvieron en le consolidación del Gastrismo y en su llegada al poder.

vuelta de las Puerzes Armadas.

No hay duda de que Fidel está poniendo en los puestos claves a hombres y mujeres, que buenos o malos comunistas, son amigos personales de él, y és- to le va a traer problemas con la vieja guardia del Partido Comunista y con la nueva guardia que por encima de Fidelista, ha recibido un indoe- trinamiento COMUNISTA (muchos de ellos simpatizan con Raul).

Parece ser que Rusia está muy descontenta con Fidel y no me extrañaría que intentara un golpe de mano contra ólido todas formas, hay que insi- nuar ésto en la propaganda contra Castro, ya que con su mentalidad paranoi- de y el disgusto que tiene con Rusia, es capaz de creerlo a pié juntillas y comensar a depurar a tomar represalias contra los incondicionales de Moscúslo cual crearía un ambiente de tensión entre Rusia y ól.

El. repudio de los Partidos Comunistas Latino-Americanos obedientes a Mos- cúme parece un bue sintoma de disgusto de Ru

Yo tengo listos unos 200 hombres, que con solo recibir las armas, pueden ser colocados en Cuba en solo 48 horas, en caso de una revuelta. La misión sería tomar un pueblo con emisora de radio para aprovechar el caos de la revuelta y establecer un Gobierno en armas, que sería reconocido de inmediato por uma cantidad de Gobiernos Latino-Americanos y algún país Europeo.

6-Ablanedo me dice en una carta, que ROBERTO, el "amigo" de Nicaragua, le ha dicho que él no se puede ir de Blueffield hasta que todo no se saque. Eso se llevará parte de este mes, lo cual significa que además del sub- sidio familiar del mes pasado que ya le entregué, le voy a tener que en- tregar el de Abril. Podía la Compañía ayudarme en eso?Son $275.00 mensua- las.Es lo que yo le dos a su familia en Miami. Ahi no está incluido lo que él está gastando en Blueffield.

Dear Jin:

Just a few lines to report the following:

1.  I believe that Communism will concentrate on Nicaragua as a point of attack.

2.  The men who have returned to Nicaragua after receiving training in Cuba only acted indirectly in the bloody events of the 22nd, because according to information gathered in Nicaragua through "Pepe Fernandez," the "Sandinistas" communists (who follow the Castro line) were awaiting the assassination of the Somoza in Leon and this was never realized (carried out). These men were expecting an outbreak before Tacho Somoza took over the Presidency of the Republic.

3.  I an structuring (building) an anticommunist intelligence net in Nicaragua, which I have begun to instruct (train). This net is composed of: Jose Fernández ("Pepe" Fernández) Manager of Casa Hook. Rodolfo Jerez, Owner of casa "Vent." Capitalist of various enterprises.

Orlando Castrillo - Studies law, 5th year (5?) year of age He has a grocery (foodstuffs) business.

Duilio Cabrera - Studies law, 4th year. Works in the Ministry of Agriculture, in the Department of Live Stock. He is 25 years old.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

-2-

Roberto Arellano - Studies law, 5th year. He works in the National Palace. Department of (Providad?). It is a position related to employees and workers. He is 28 years of age.

Roberto Arias - Studies law, 6th year. Owner of an auto- mobile spare parts business.

These individuals are going to create an anticommunist intelligence net. I have already given them one week of conferences.

4. According to reports received by Pepe, a Nicaraguan named Gustavo Gomez Mesa, acquired through various subjects (persons), about $5,000.00 in arms in Miami, from the Tamiami Gun Shop. The money was contributed by Aguirre, the owner of "Diario de las Americas" (and director), through an individual named Germán Arellano. These arms were going to be infiltrated into Nicaragua in small quantities at a time.

5. Today I received from Adolfo Jiménez (old chief of the Camp "Francisco" of communications, of Costa Rica) the pro- position to ask Nicaragua for permision to launch the invasion from there to Haiti. Accoring to him there is a group of Capitalists in New York who are willing to send from Europe about $80,000.00 in arms, to any designated location in Nicaragua. I am attempting to find out the names of these capitalists so that I can report it. I have replied that I will think the proposition over very cautiously before pre- senting it to Nicaragua. Of course, I will not get involved in this adventure unless you desire the contrary.

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Termination of Manuel Artime Buesa

1. On the night of 13 January 1967 the writer using the operational alias James E. Wilson met with Artime in a room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida. The purpose of the meeting was to formally terminate Artime's association with the Agency. This involved the obtaining of termination Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover the final periodical payment through 31 December 1966 and obtaining outstanding receipts.

2. The meeting was cordial and all paper work involved in the proceedings was accomplished without incident. There was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had done (or tried to do) for the Agency in the past and an un- doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that he was ready and willing for any task he might be called upon to do in the future.

3. Artime made only one request--a rather passionate one--for financial assistance for the immediate family members of two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR) members who were executed as the result of operational missions to Cuba and the wife of another who is serving a 30-year sentence. (It will be recalled that Artime has been furnishing receipts for the $3,000 he has been receiving in recent months claiming that the money goes to the families of MRR members who have lost their lives or been imprisoned while on MRR missions.) We are examining these three cases and if worthy will arrange for financial benefits under the "survivors and martyrs" section of the AMBUD activity.

4. Artime has a sterile Headquarters telephone number and a P.O. box address in Washington, D.C. He was not scouraged in maintaining a loose contact by telephone or correspondence if he had any items of interest to pass along and was assured that if he ever had any "new" ideas, if he put them in writing, they would be studied. It was, however, made very clear to him that his formal association with the Agency was terminated and that there was no prospect of any financial assistance in the foreseeable future.

5. Mr. Robert Stevenson, Coordinator of Cuban Affairs for the Department of State, and Mr. William Bowdler, Staff Member National Security Council (White House Assistant), were notified prior to Artime's termination and voiced no objections.

I, *Manuel Artima Buesa*, am about to terminate my asociation with the Organization. I realize that, by virtue of my duties with the perfeccion, I have been the recipient of information and intelligence .hich concerns the present and future. security of the United States. I am aware that the unauthorized dis- closure of such information is prohibited by the espionage laws of the United States Government which specifically requires the protection of intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR, WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS, AS FOLLOWS:

1.  I will never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct, or otherwise, any information relating to the national defense and security and particularly information of this nature relating to intel ligence sources, methods, personnel, fiscal data, or security measures to anyone, including, but not limited to, any future governmental or private employer, private citizen, or government employee or official without the express written consent of the Chief of the Organization or his authorized representative.

2.  I acknowledge that should I again be affiliated with another government agency or department, I will preserve the secrecy of Intelligence operations, sources, and methods of the Organization from other persons in such government agencies and departments, even though such persons are fully cleared, or are in possession of any type of security clearance, within their own departments.

3.  I further affirm that I will not discuss with or disclose to any government employed, foreign service officer, or other official with whow I may later be associated, any information relating directly to clandestine operations, sources or methods, personnel or fiscal figures of the Organization, or to special operations, security measures, or other matters which may have been acquired by reason of my assignment with the Organization unless by permission of the Chief of the Organisation or his authorized representative.

4.  I certify that I have no monetary claims against the Organization, nor does any organization I now direct or have directed during my association with the Organization. My signature as affixed hereto represents a quit claim absolving the Organization of any financial or other responsibility for myself and above-described organizations and members thereof. Should there be any future claims, I have been advised to subait in writing to the Organization any such claims I or any organization I now direct or have directed during my association

# TERMINATION SECRECY OATH

1. Manuel F. Artime Buesa, am about to terminate my association with the Organization. I realize that, by virtue of my duties with the Organization, I have been the recipient of information and intelligence which concerns the present and future security of the United States. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited by the espionage laws of the United States Government which specifically requires the protection of intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR, WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS, AS FOLLOWS:

1.  I will never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct, or otherwise, any information relating to the national defense and security and particularly information of this nature relating to intelligence sources, methods, personnel, fiscal data, or security measures to anyone, including, but not limited to, any future governmental or private employer, private citizen, or government employee or official without the express written consent of the Chief of the Organization or his authorized representative.

2.  I acknowledge that should I again be affiliated with another government agency or department, I will preserve the secrecy of intelligence operations, sources, and methods of the Organization from other persons in such government agencies and departments, even though such persons are fully cleared, or are in possession of any type of security clearance, within their own departments.

3.  I further affirm that I will not discuss with or disclose to any government employee, foreign service officer, or other official with whom I may later be associated, any information relating directly to clandestine operations, sources or methods, personnel or fiscal figures of the Organization, or to special operations, security measures, or other matters which may have been acquired by reason of my assignment with the Organization unless by permission of the Chief of the Organization or his authorized representative.

4.  I certify that I have no monetary claims against the Organization, nor does any organization I now direct or have directed during my association with the Organization. My signature as affixed hereto represents a quit claim absolving the Organization of any financial or other responsibility for myself and above-described organizations and members thereof. Should there be any future claims, I have been advised to submit in writing to the Organization any such claims I or any organization I now direct or have directed during my association

with the Organization may have against the Organization or the United
States Government which may in any way necessitate the disclosure of
information described herein. I have been advised that any such claims
will receive legal consideration. In the event, however, that the
decisions of the Organization concerning such claims are not satisfactory,
no other action will be taken to obtain satisfaction without prior written
notice to the Organization, and then only in accordance with such legal
and security advice as the Organization will promptly furnish me.

5. I do not have any documents or materials in my possession, classified
   or unclassified, which are the property of, or in custodial responsibility.
   of the Organization, having come into my possession as a result of my
   duties with the Organization or otherwise.

6. During my exit processing and during my period of association with
   the Organization I have been given an opportunity to report all infor-
   mation about the organization, its personnel, and its operations which
   I consider should receive official cognizance. Hence, I am not aware
   of any information which it is my duty, in the national interest, to
   disclose to the Organization, nor am I aware of any violations or
   breaches of security which I have not officially reported, except as
   set forth below.

7. I have been advised that, in the event I am called upon by the
   properly constituted authorities to testify or provide information
   which I an pledged hereby not to disclose, I will notify the Organi-
   zation immediately; I will also advise said authorities of my secrecy
   commitments and will request that my right or need to testify be
   established before I am required to do so.

8. I am aware of the provisions and penalties of the espionage laws
   of the United States Government and am fully aware that any violation
   on my part of certain matters sworn to by me under this oath may
   subject me to prosecution under the terms of these laws, and that
   violation of other portions of this oath are subject to appropriate
   action, including such dissemination of the violation as the circum-
   stances warrant.

I have read and understand the contents of this oath and voluntarily
affix my signature hereto with the full knowledge that this oath was
executed for the mutual benefit of myself and the United States Govern-
ment, and that it will be retained in the files of the Organization for
its future use or for reference by me at any time in the future that I
may be requested or ordered to testify or disclose any of the matters
included within the scope of this oath.

# DR. MANUEL F. ARTIME

Enero 13 de 1967

Estimado Jims

Adjunto te envío el Memorandum sobre los tres casos de que te hable hoy personalmentes

## MANUEL GUILLOT:

Este señor es el padre de Manuel Guillot Castellanos, fundador del Movimiento, que trabajo para el MRR y para la "Compañía" durante los años de 1959, 1560 y1961, hasta el 30 de Agosto de 1962, en que fue fusilado por la Tiranía Roja en Cuba.

Fue torturado y murió sin decir el nombre de los rectores del Clandestinaje Cubano que el conocla. Fue infiltrado en Cuba por la "Compañia" varias veces, una de ellas, su ultimo viaje en que fue fusilado.

Manuel Guillot padre tiene 65 años de edad y su esposa, que vive,es paraiſtice y sólo se mueve con aparatos ortopedicos. Este pobre viejo no puede hacer trabajo físico y su mujer es Invalida. sotros le estabamos pasando $300.00 mensuales. No veo forma en que este hombre pueda hacer otro trabajo que el que hace, de oficinista. Su esposa ha sido sometida a tres operaciones quirúrgicas y el médico dice que necesita una más.

## SILVIA HEREDIA:

es la viuda de Jorge Fundora,el que descubrió el punto de entrada de la mayor parte de armas y "Teams de infiltracion" que fueron a Cuba antes y despues de Bahia de Cochinos. Esta pobre mujer esta sola en el mundo con dos hijos. Ella esta recibiendo tratamiento Psiquiatr. Costel MAR le pasa 125 dolares mensuales. Ella no puede abandonar su hogar con los dos hijos para ir a trabajar. ou esposo fue fusilado el 12 de Octubre de 1961 y murió sin decir el punto por donde entraban las armas y los hombres de la "Compañia" en Cuba.

## ROSA RABASA

es la esposa de Francisco Echeverria Texier, condenado hace 6 años a 30 años de Presidio por los esbirros rojos. Esta mujer es sorda, solo puede coser en su casa para mantener-se ella y los dos hijos que tiene. No le es suficiente y el MRR le pasa $75.00 dolares mensuales. Este hombre (su esposo) trabajo intensamente con la gente de Francisco, transportando las armas que la "Compañia" metía en Cuba.

En todos estos casos, que son desesperados,ei MRR ha costeado hasta los tratamientos médicos.

DR. MANUEL F. ARTIME

(2)

Para la mayor tranquilidad de los hombres que hantrabajado y trabajan con la "Compañia", seria conveniente que esta gente no pasaran hambre y miseria, ya que han sido sus parientes muertos o presos, hombres que han servido lealmente a la COMPAÑIa y han dado ejemplo de valor y de abnegacióngbien distinto de los "héroes" de hoy que van a la Television cubana cuando son capturados para hablar mal de la causa anti-communista, de los EEUU y de la "COMPANIA".

Es lo único que me preocupa de la nueva situación crada a partir de

Enero de 1967.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Station, San Jose

FROM: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY-1 Discussions with Frank MARSHALL and Daniel ODUBER

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

REFERENCES: A. HRS-3845, 12 December 1966

B. HNMW-1930, 19 December 1966

1. AMBIDDY-1 gave the following information to James D. ZABOTIl in Managua on 15 December 1966 and was told to pass it on to his leadquarters contact for proper handling and distribution. This report is forwarded as a follow-up in case the information failed to get into proper channels, as it has a direct connection with Reference A and is a sequel to Reference B.

2. Between 7 and 13 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked three times with Frank MARSHALL, at the latter's request. HARSHALL first called AMBIDDY-1 and asked if they could meet at MARSIIALL's office to talk about the possibility of MARSHALL investing in the business proposition in which AMBIDDY-1 was involved. (A concession for a commercial record player with a television type screen on which scenes are displayed which are supposed to be synchronized with the music.) After two such meetings, which AMHIDDY-1 described as "get-acquainted" and "feeling-out" sessions (the two men had never met in person previously), MARSHALL asked if he could visit AMBIDDY-1 privately in his hotel room. They met on 12 December 1966 at AMBIDDY-1's suite in the Gran Hotel in San Jose.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

3. MARSHALL said he knew AMBIDDY-1 had some weapons. AMBIDDY-1 replied that the weapons in Nicaraguan had been given to the Nicaraguan Government, but MARSHALL continued to press the point, saying he knew there were others. AMBIDDY-1 at last reluctantly admitted that he did have a few more scattered around under tight security (he says this is not true, in fact), but indicated that he had other plans for their use. MARSHALL said he did not care where they were or what they cost, he would buy them. AMBIDDY-1 asked him why he wanted weapons so badly, and MARSHALL replied that he was always in the market for weapons. AMBIDDY-1 said he was aware of that fact, but this did not sound like just another routine business deal. He went on to say that he would not even consider releasing any of his arms without knowing where they were going and for what use, and that he had heard that MARSHALL had sold weapons previously to the Communists. He would have nothing to do with such an operation, regardless of any possible profit in it. He tried to elicit as much information as possible, but got very little. MARSHALL said they had a common friend in General SOMOZA, to which AMBIDDY-1 replied that this was fairly recent as SOMOZA and MARSHALL had been bitter enemies up until about the last three years. AMBIDDY-1 said he had to know how many arms were wanted, when, where, and for what purpose. MARSHALL said he wanted all he could get, as soon as possible, in Costa Rica, and the reason was that he knew a coup was being prepared and he wanted to get his own people ready in time. AMBIDDY-1 said he would have to think about the proposition and would give him an answer in about three weeks. (He intends to stall and make no commitments, hoping to draw out more information. He will not agree to sell any arms.)

4. On 7 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked with Daniel ODUBER at the latter's office. ODUBER said he was worried about all the talk of coup plotting, weapons and other indicators of possible violence. ODUBER again mentioned to AMBIDDY-1 that he had a finca on the Pacific Coast near the Nicaraguan border which has an airstrip adequate for a C-46 or C-47 type aircraft, and made an effort to feel out AMBIDDY-1 about the possibility of landing arms on that airstrip. AMBIDDY-1 was noncommital and ODUBER did not press the point.

5. AMBIDDY-1 said (as his opinion) that he had gotten the impression from talking with MARSHALL and ODUBER that ODUBER is pushing MARSHALL to stage a coup attempt in the hope that he, ODUBER, can step in at the right time and claim the Presidency. ODUBER considers Jose "Pepe" FIGUERES to be his main rival in such a plan, however. He seems to think the TREJOS administration is doomed in a matter of time.

Miami 10 de Enero de 1967

Estimado Jima

El Dr. Alvarez Tormo estuvo el domingo y el lunes y el martes en Miami.

El motivo de su visitas

1-Contacto con amigo de Carlos en Mejico deficiente. Solo puede hablar con el contacto cuando este lo llama por telefono, y esto lo hace muy de tarde en tarde. Hay cosas urgentes que el espia de la embajada cubana le plantea, que el no puede decidir sin hablar primero con el amigo de Carlos.Por ejemplosle plante ron un viaje clandestino a Venezuela.

Seria conveniente que Alvarez Tormo pudiera llamar un telefono cada vez que necesite ver al amigo.

2-Los agences de la Embajada cubana temieron una ruptura con Mejico hace dos semanas y le comunicaron a Alvarez Tormo un sistema de comunicaciones de emergencia, que te envio adjunto en la propia letra de Alvare: Tormo.Antes de venir Alvarez Tormo, el cubano le dijo que la situacion critica con Mejico habia pasado, pero que guardara el sistema de emergencia hasta despues de la "Reunion de Presidentes Americanos"

3-Como vez,le ensenaror a Alvarez Tormo hasta un lugar donde el podia recibir "material" (es decira Propaganda, materiales de sabotaje, armas etc.)

3-Creo que esto bien trabajado puede dar un resultado formidable,pero creo que si el contacto en Mejico no funciona, Alvarez Tormo va a terminar por evadir lo que para el significa un peligr para sus familiares en Cuba.

4-Ya en Cuba trasladaron al hermano de Alvarez Torme de la Prision para una granja donde la vida es mas comoda y la familia lo puede ver.Le han traido noticias de su hermano.

Abrazoss

MEMORANDUM:

SUBJECT : Subversive and Political Activities in Central America

Source of the following information is a prominent Cuban exile who is a fairly reliable reporter. He has a large number of direct and indirect contacts with influential Latin American nationals. Source acquired the information from discussions held with the individuals mentioned, during the month of December 1966.

During a conversation with Frank Marshall in early December 1966, source learned that Marshall wanted to buy arms and asked source to supply them. Marshall said that he needed then for what he called "an expected revolutionary outburst from one moment to the next in Costa Rica", and he did not want his "private arsenal" to be smaller than the arsenals of the Calderon Guardia group, Pepe Figueres' group, Oduber's group and the Communist group. Source asked Marshall when he needed the arms and Marshall answered NOW. Source replied that he would need at least three weeks to think about Marshall's request and then he would give Marshall an answer. After considering what source had said, Marshall replied, "okay, I can give you one month to give me an answer but no more." Source believes Marshall is in a plot to cverthrow the Costa Rican Government. In source's opinion "the situation in Costa Rica is very bad because the president does not have a definite political group to support him and therefore is in the hands of diverse groups; Calderon Guardia, Ulate. Zohandi, Frank Marshall etc., who respond to their own sectarian interests and not to Costa Rica, and who respond buch less to President Trejos, the Partido Liberacion Nacional, (PLN) is expecting a coup d'etat and plan to counter-attack and stay in power."

In a conversation with Daniel Oduber in early December 1966, source states that Oduber "spoke badly poort Don Pepe Figueres and "Chico Orlich". Oduber said that "they wanted to eliminate his presidential aspirations for the coming campaign and postulate Don Fope again." Oduber said that "they (Don Pepe and Orlich) were the

Johnsons of Costa Rica and he (Oduber) was the Kennedy. I'm lucky that they are stupid and that they are not avare of the fact that an attack is being created and they are not prepared for that emergency. I am prepared." Oduber then told source of an airfield on his farm close to the Nicaraguan border where at the determined moment he could receive arms.

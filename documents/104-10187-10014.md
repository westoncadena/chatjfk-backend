MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director for Operations

THROUGH: MPS/BG

SUBJECT: Amendment and Termination of Project KDFACTOR

1. Project KDFACTOR supported a visual and photographic surveillance operation in Mexico City targetted against the Soviet Embassy. Assets included five agents and two basehouse surveillance sites. Termination of this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of a security review which revealed that the VWBLANKET principal knew the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations.

2. Agent termination was accomplished without any immediate difficulties; however, continued security will depend on the terminated agents' silence. In the event there is a compromise, the risk of damage to the Station's relations with the Mexican Government should be minimized because of the compatible nature of KDFACTOR'S operations.

3. The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the project in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 occurred as the result of miscalculation of termination costs. This project action requests this additional sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses.

4. The FI Staff recommends approval of this amendment/termination request.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director
For Operations

SUBJECT : Project KDFACTOR - Amendment
and Termination Request.

1. The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted
   as the LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in
   1958 to provide financial and material support for
   visual and photographic surveillance operations
   targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
   City. In June 1972 the project supported five
   agents and two basehouse surveillance sites.

2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
   ADDC in the amount of $19,000 for FY 72 and
   $20,000 for FY 73. Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated
   30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment No. 1
   to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
   for FY 72 to provide for costs of agent
   terminations.

3. The decision to terminate all agents and
   facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
   on a security review of the project activities
   which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew
   the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
   including the target, the location of the surveillance
   sites, and probably the true names and former
   cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.

4. The cost of terminating the agents under the
   KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
   closing down the two basehouses under the project
   was $1,412. The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR
   Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
   the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
   was incurred in terminating the agents and
   facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project.
   Although Amendment No. 1 to the project was
   approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the
   cost of terminating the agents in the

project, the actual payments made by Mexico City Station per the terms of each Memorandum of Oral Commitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment was requested. Termination payments made to each agent are as follows:

KDFACTOR-2 (Recruited 1956) $8,160
KDFACTOR-5 (Recruited 1956) 2,366
KDFACTOR-6 (Recruited 1956) 2,830
KDFACTOR-8 (Recruited 1965) 649
KDFACTOR-9 (Recruited 1966) 1,568

The long tenure of three of the terminated agents, the relatively high monthly salary of KPFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the termination payments in accordance with Mexican law and custom were the primary reasons that the final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

5. All agent terminations were accomplished in an amicable manner. No visible security risks were apparent at the time of the terminations although any one, or all, of the terminated agents may at some future date decide to divulge to an interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project operations. KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-5, and KDFACTOR-6 have worked in photo surveillance operations for the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously have considerable knowledge of targets, former safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the Station. However, since the KDFACTOR Project was not concerned with incompatible operations or targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station relations with the Mexican Government in the event of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY - 72 to cover the costs of terminating five agents and two basehouse surveillance sites under this project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director
For Operations
SUBJECT : Project KDFACTOR - Amendment and
Termination Request.

1. The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted as the LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in 1958 to provide financial and materiel support for visual and photographic surveillance operations targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. In June 1972 the project supported five agents and two basehouse surveillance sites.

2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the ADDO in the amount of $19,000 for FY-72 and $20,000 for FY-73. Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated 30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844 for FY-72 to provide for costs of agent terminations.

3. The decision to terminate all agents and facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based on a security review of the project activities which indicated that the WWBLANKET principal knew the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations, including the target, the location of the surveillance sites, and probably the true names and former cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.

4. The costs of terminating all the agents in the KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573.00 which was considerably more than had been initially estimated when Amendment No. 1 for FY-72 was requested and approved. The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR Project in FY-72 was $36,000 which is $7,246 over the project's authorization of $28,844. The overage was incurred in terminating agents and facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project; the effective date of all termi- nations was 30 June 1972.

5. All agent terminations were accomplished in an amicable manner. No visible security risks were apparent at the time of the terminations although any one, or all of the terminationed agents may at some future date decide to divulge to an interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project operations. KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5 have worked in photo surveillance operations for the Station since 1957 and, therefore, obviously have considerable knowledge of targets, former safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the Station. However, since the KDFACTOR Project was not concerned with incompatible operations or targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station relations with the Mexican Government in the event of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY-72 to cover the costs of terminating five agents and two basehouse surveillance sites covered by this project.

7. It is also requested that the termination of the KDFACTOR Project be approved effective 30 June 1972.

KDFACTOR - Mexico City, Mexico -- Photographic Surveillance
Team Support -- FY 1972, Cost $19,000 and FY 1973,
Cost $20,000

| Fiscal Year | Approved | Obligated |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1971        | $23,635  | $27,586   |

Changes:

1.  The processing of photographs obtained through this
    project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
    formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
    terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
    ciency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-1 was
    terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
    during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

2.  Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
    project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
    reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP
    Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
    administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
    over to the outside case officer Bruce R. FERNALD. When
    ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
    assumed responsibility for this project, including agent
    meetings.

Accomplishments:

1.  This project has provided continuous daily photo-,
    graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
    or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
    were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens,
    visitors, and DY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
    tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
    well as drivers and their commpanions are identified under this
    project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
    establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

These photographs and reports have contributed operational support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets change all their license numbers the Station is able to compile a new, complete roster within a matter of weeks.

Costs:

1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and $20,000 is requested for FY 1973. It is also requested that the Project be amended for FY 1971 in the amount of $4,260 to provide for the termination of KDFACTOR-1 and KDFACTOR-7.

2. Source of Funds: Project KDFACTOR is included in the Western Hemisphere Division's Operational Program in the amount of $23,735 for FY 1972 and $24,182 for FY 1973.

8 DEC 1971

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: MPS/BG

SUBJECT: Renewal of Project KDFACTOR
in 1972 for $19,000
in 1973 for $20,000

1. This project covers photo and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. One observation post covers the front gate of the building, and another covers the rear gate and walled compound. Five salaried agents man the sites, four in front and one in back. An official cover case officer collects the take (rolls of film and logs of visitors) once a week by car meetings with the OP keepers. The films are developed and printed inside the Station.

2. The production from this operation has consistently been rated high by the Bureau (which is the principal customer in the field), by other Government agencies and by SB Division. Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy might not be a high priority target in some countries. But the fact that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico is a large and active one and the fact that its primary target is operations against the United States make our effort important and valuable. This is the operation that produced the photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald visiting the Soviet Embassy in 1962.

3. This seemingly straightforward operation has not always been so uncomplicated. Both sites have been in operation and served by the same OP keepers for more than a dozen years. At one of the sites the OP keeper's wife and children take turns manning the equipment. A now-terminated principal agent was divorced several years ago from a wife who knew a lot about the operation. Some desk officers believe that the medical doctor who for years was supposed to be developing the films was simply too busy to do so and that the work was probably done by his uncleared secretary. Family relationships keep cropping up among supposedly compartmented agents. All of this is in the files but not in any one place. We


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

believe it is time for the Station to make an updated security review of the operation with particular attention to the knowledgeability of terminated agents and their families. We also believe that the Station should now address itself to the contingency that the present sites or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative means of continuing their valuable coverage.

4. The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970 with the condition that termination payments to the principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a monthly basis. This condition has been met.

5. The budgets requested for the next two years are simple and straightforward. Salaries and the traditional bonuses for the five paid agents come to about $13,000. Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to $5,600. The small balance is for operational expenses. This project action also requests amendment of the FY 1971 budget by $4,260 to cover that part of the cost of termination bonuses to the principal agent and his di- vorced wife which could not be absorbed by the project. The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.

6. This is a valuable and productive project which helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement. The FI Staff recommends approval.

KDFACTOR - Mexico City, Mexico -- Photographic Surveillance
Team Support -- FY 1972, Cost $19,000 and FY 1973,
Cost $20,000

| Fiscal Year | Approved | Obligated |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1971        | $23,635  | $27,586   |

Changes:

1.  The processing of photographs obtained through this project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and efficiency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-7 was terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

2.  Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this project to early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD. When ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS assumed responsibility for this project, including agent meetings.

Accomplishments:

1.  This project has provided continuous daily photographic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens, visitors, and TDY personnel are given special attention. Identifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as well as drivers and their companions are identified under this project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

# SECRET

These photographs, and reports have contributed operational support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets change all their license numbers the Station is able to compile a new, complete roster within a matter of weeks.

Costs:

1.  General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and $20,000 is requested for FY 1973. It is also requested that the Project be amended for FY 1971 in the amount of $4,260 to provide for the termination of KDFACTOR-1 and KDFACTOR-7.

2.  Source of Funds: Project KDFACTOR is included in the Western Hemisphere Division's Operational Program in the amount of $23,735 for FY 1972 and $24,182 for FY 1973.

| 1970        | 38,970   | 49,468 (Projected) |

Purpose:

Project LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. The aim is to identify and cover the movements of persons entering and leaving the Embassy, including Soviets and visitors. The intelligence collected through such activity contributes to the Station's overall Soviet operations program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to some extent, Priority A-4, of the Operating Directive for Mexico.

Description:

1.  The Project operates through two fixed basehouse surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a principal agent, and six sub-agents. A team of four sub- agents, operating from a basehouse, maintains visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front entrance. One sub-agent, operating from a second base- house, covers an area in back of the Embassy, where Soviet officials meet, play and work. These units photograph all persons moving in or out of the specific target areas. They also maintain logs and provide written reports on observed activity. All of this material is passed to the principal agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process- ing at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the film is processed and printed, the principal agent passes the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the Station case officer. A brief description of each unit, each agent and his role in the operation follows.

2. LILYRIC (MEXI-132) is a basehouse located near the front of the Soviet Embassy. This house has been in operation since October 1966. It is rented through LIMOUSINE (201-5762), a cleared American businessman. He is the ostensible owner of record and, as the landlord, collects rent from the tenants and then passes it to the Station case officer. LIEMPTY-13 and his family (seo paragraph 3 below) live in the LILYRIC house and conduct their surveillance operation from it during daylight hours (0800-1800).

3. LIEMPTY-13 (201-119961) is the key member of the LILYRIC baschouse team. He maintains contact with tho principal agent and does some photographic work. Howover, because LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside as an industrial engineer, he is unable to spend much time operating the LILYRIC photographic equipmont, and most of this work is done by his wife, LIEMPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26 and LIEMPTY-27 (see paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 bolow).

4. LIEMPTY-14 (201-167567) is the main photographer and observer at the LILYRIC basehouse. She works closely with her husband, LIEMPTY-13, in running the operation, including the preparation of observation reports and logs. She also does the LILYRIC housekeeping, as any housewife would do.

5. LIEMPTY-26 (201-762111), the son of LIEMPTY-13 and LIEMPTY-14, has been a student at the Mexican Technological Institute. In his spare time he operates the LILYRIC photo- graphic equipment, and helps LIEMPTY-14 in maintaining the arrival and departure logs of target personalities.

6. LIEMPTY-27 (201-762112), another son of LIEMPTY-13 and LIEMPTY-14, has been a prep school student. Ho assists in operating the LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran- scribes notes into a finished typewritten log of events.

7. LICALLA (MEXI-03) is a basehouse located behind the Soviet Embassy. It has been in operation since 1957. The building, a four-unit affair, collectively known as LIMUST, is Agency owned. It was purchased through LIMOUSINE in September 1957, and the property is in his name. The LICALLA site is occupied by LIEMPTY-9 (see paragraph 8 below) and he runs the surveillance operation from it.

8. LIEMPTY-9 (201-136454) is the only agent operating from the LICALLA site. He does all the photography, maintains logs and prepares observation reports. He also maintains contact with the principal agent. LIEMPTY-9 is a part-time insurance salesman and is self-employed in the accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.

9. Raymond H. GERENDE (201-119523) has been the principal agent for this project. He is a Mexican national contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer. GERENDE has been mainly responsible for maintaining contact with the LIEMPTY agents, passing instructions to them, and collecting the product for passing to the Station case officer. He has also paid them and handled all other administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end of FY 1970 for security reasons (see Problems, paragraph 1).

10. Bruce H. FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced GERENDE (see paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal agent in early December 1969. FERNALD, a U.S. citizen born in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired immigrant. He is responsible for maintaining contact with the LIEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing to the Station case officer. He also handles administrative matters, including agent salary payments. FERNALD is financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.

11. The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (MEXI-137) is located in a room at GERENDE's residence. It is equipped to process the photographs taken by the LIEMPTY surveillance units. The work is done by LIEMPTY-4. (See paragraph 12 below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new LIEMPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.

12. LIEMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photographic film taken by the LIEMPTY photographers and makes the number of prints required. He does this work at night in the LIEMPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed as a medical doctor, and he is a brother-in-law of GERENDE, in whose home the laboratory is located.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 41

Changes:

1.  The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIEMPTY-10 and LIEMPTY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet a growing demand for operational surveillance support from the various Station operating sections. The transfer w111 become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial aspects of the change.

2.  Raymond H. GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security problem (sec Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on 9. December 1969 by Bruce H. FERNALD, a career agent oper- ating under cover as a retired immigrant. The change has caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not significantly reduced by this delay. The key issue is that security and reliability of the principal agent have improved considerably.

Accomplishments:

1.  Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday) of the front entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. All Soviet personnel and their visitors entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed. In addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper- ations program.

2.  Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico. The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One 902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo- graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Similarly, an AF/OSI
controlled agent scheduled to meet a Soviet contact was
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed
another person who appeared at the meeting site and this
person is believed to be the agent's Soviet case officer.
Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and
the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations
against the Soviets in Mexico.

3. Within one week after a biannual change of license
   plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a
   complete list of the new tag numbers, along with a complete
   identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this
   enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
   Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during his
   last few days in Moxico.

4. LIEMPTY has also determined that newcomers to the
   Soviet Embassy frequently gravitate to groupings with their
   RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the Embassy backyard.
   This fact enabled the Station to make certain tentative
   KGB and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers
   have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
   to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.

5. In the field of Soviet patterns of activity and
   associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate
   changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
   that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
   activity pattern following the defection of Raisa
   Yerofeyevna KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
   Mission in Mexico. The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,
   a Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officer.
   LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
   associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
   officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, a known GRU
   officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
   suspect KGB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a
   "restricted area" at the Soviet Embassy and also established
   who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg
   Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Mexico City
   from Caracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was able to observe
   IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav
   Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of
   the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Embassy

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 43

several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known Soviet intelligence officers
while visiting. This kind of information is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible
recruitment or defection.

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
   LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
   Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
   nection with defector cases. The LIEMPTY material also
   keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
   Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have
   been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact
   with whom; and other similar information useful in the
   conduct of Soviet operations.

Problems:

1. A security problem has developed involving
   Raymond II. GERENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife wants
   a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of
   personalities. The problem basically is that both want
   custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute
   that has become more bitter and violent daily. In addition,
   the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problem is
   compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in some
   considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behalf of
   the Agency. Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
   lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and
   possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.
   Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
   expose him as an Agency employee. Since late 1969, Mexico
   City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his
   wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
   the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of
   court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the
   project. After weighing all factors, it has been decided
   that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable
   risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him
   by the end of FY 1979. GERENDE will be paid a termination
   bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
   than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure
   that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve

project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her
from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is being amended to cover this amount..

2. Other aspects of security continue relatively
   unchanged. All the agents still have jobs to backstop
   their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from
   the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the
   sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
   retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
   LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
   once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
   from the target area. Occasionally emergency meetings are
   called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
   also meets LIEMPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
   meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
   FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4
   directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been
   given a special extension in the Station through which he
   may call as "Dr. Carios" to leave a message for "Victor"
   (FERNALD). The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
   destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-
   ation and collect the product.

Coordination:

Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY.

Future Plans:

1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to
   produce valuable information in the form of photographic
   coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
   movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
   persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
   officials. Operational procedures and the project mecha-
   nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
   H. FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
   operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).

2. The Project does not include an up-dated plan for
   emergency contact during violent action or government over-
   throw. The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
   dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters
   in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.

Purpose:

Project LIEGT supports a visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. The aim is to identify and cover the movements of persons entering and leaving the Embassy, including Soviets and visitors. The intelligence collected through such activity contributos to the Station's overall Soviet operations program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to some extent, Priority A-4, of the Operating Directive for Mexico.

Description:

1.  The Project operates through two fixed basehouse surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a principal agent, and six sub-agents. A team of four sub- agents, operating from a basehouse, maintains visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front entrance. Ono sub-agent, operating from a second base- house, covers an area in back of the Embassy, where Soviet officials meet, play and work. These units photograph all persons moving in or out of the specific target areas. They also maintain logs and provide written reports on observed activity. All of this material is passed to the principal agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for proces- ing at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the film is processed and printed, the principal agent passen the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the Station case officer. A brief description of each unit, each agent and his role in the operation follo৬৪.

2. LILYRIC (MEXI-132) is a basehouse located near the front of the Soviet Embassy. This house has been in operation since October 1966. It is rented through LIMOUSINE (201-5762), a cleared American businessaan. Ho is the ostensible owner of record and, as the landlord, collects rent from the tenants and then passes it to the Station case officer. LIEMPTY-13 and his family (see paragraph 3 below) live in the LILYRIC house and conduct their surveillance operation from it during daylight hours (0800-1800).

3. LIEMPTY-13 (201--119961) is the key member of the LILYRIC basehouse team.. He maintains contact with the principal agent and does sone photographic work. However, becauso LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside as an industrial engineer, he is unable to spend much time operating the LILYRIC photographic oquipment, and most of this work is done by his wife, LIEMPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26 and LIEMPTY-27 (see paragraphs 4, 5 and 8 bolow).

4. LIEMPTY-14 (201-167567) is the main photographer and observer at the LILYRIC basehouse. She works closely with her husband, LIEMPTY-13, 1n running the operation, including the preparation of observation reports and logs. She also does the LILYRIC housekeeping, as any housewife would do.

5. LIEMPTY-26 (201-7652111), the son of LIEMPTY-13 and LIEMPTY-14, has been a student at the Mexican Technological Institute. In his spare time ho operates the LILYRIC photo- graphic equipment, and helps LIEMPTY-14 13 maintaining the arrival and departure logs of target personalities.

6. LIEMPTY-37 (201-762112), another son of LIEMITY-13 and LIEMPTY-14, has been a prep school student. He assists in operating the LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran- scribes notes into a finished typewritten log of events.

7. LICALLA (MEXI-03) is a basehouse located behind the Soviet Embassy. It has been in operation since 1957. The building, a four-unit affair, collectively known as LIMUST, is Agency owned. It was purchased through LINOUSINE in September 1957, and the property is in his name. The LICALLA site is occupied by LIEMPTY-9 (see paragraph 8 below) and he runs the surveillance operation from it.

8. LIEMPTY-9 (201-136454) is the only agent operating from the LICALLA site. He does all the photography, maintains logs and prepares observation reports. He also maintains contact with the principal agent. LIEMPTY-9 is a part-time insurance salesman and is self-employed in the accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.

9. Raymond H. GERENDE (201-119523) has been the principal agent for this project. He is a Mexican national contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer. GERENDE has been mainly responsible for maintaining contact with the LIEMPTY agents, paesing instructions to them, and collecting the product for passing to the Station case officer. He has also paid then and handled all other administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end of FY 1970 for security reasons (see Problems, paragraph 1).

10. Bruce II. FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced GERENDE (see paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal agent in early December 1969. FERNALD, a U.8. Citizen born in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired immigrant. He is responsible for maintaining contact with the LIEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing to the Station case officer. He also handles administrative matters, including agent salary payments. FERNALD is financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.

11. The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (MEXI-137) is located in a room at GERENDE's residence. It is equipped to process the photographs taken by the LIEMPTY surveillance units. The work is done by LIEMPTY-4. (See paragraph 12 below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new LIEMPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.

12. LIEMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photographic film taken by the LIEMPTY photographers and makes the number of prints required. He does this work at night in the LIEMPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed as a medical doctor, and he is a brother-in-law of GERENDE, in whose home the laboratory is located.

# Changes:

1.  The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIEMPTY-10
    and LIEMPTY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
    placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
    physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is
    to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
    a growing demand for operational surveillance support from
    the various Station operating sections. The transfer wil1
    become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both
    FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial
    aspects of the change.

2.  Raymond H. GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY
    principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
    problem (see Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on
    9 December 1969 by Bruce H. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
    ating under cover as a retired immigrant. The change has
    caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
    FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
    GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not
    significantly reduced by this delay. The key issue is that
    security and reliability of the principal agent have improved
    considerably.

# Accomplishments:

1.  Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
    photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
    of the front entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy
    in Mexico City. All Soviet personnel and their visitors
    entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed. In
    addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
    appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed
    essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper-
    ations program.

2.  Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
    to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
    The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd
    Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing
    their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
    operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
    902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
    graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

-3-

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Similarly, an AF/OSI controlled agent scheduled to meet a Soviet contact was unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed another person who appeared at the meeting site and this person is believed to be the agent's Soviet case officer. Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations against the Soviets in Mexico.

3. Within one week after a biannual change of license plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a complete list of the now tag numbers, along with a complete identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during his last few days in Mexico.

4. LIEMPTY has also determined that newcomers to the Soviet Embassy frequently gravitato to groupings with their RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the Kabassy backyard. This fact enabled the Station to make certain tentative KGB and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers have been linked up with their escort officers and clues to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.

5. In the field of Soviet patterns of activity and associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate changes in certain specific cавев. LIEMPTY Coverage showed that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his activity pattern following the defection of Raisa Yerofeyevna KISELNIKOVA, formor secretary in the Commercial Mission in Mexico. The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO, a Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officor. LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, & known GRU officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a suspect KGB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a "restricted arca" at the Soviet Embassy and also established who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Hexico City from Caracas, Venezuela, LIKMPTY was able to observe IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Embassy

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

several other times during his stay in Lexico City and had contact with other known Soviet inteiligence officers while visiting. This kind of information is a basic contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to identify and assess certain Soviets for possible recruitment or defection.

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet Embassy officials, for identification purposes in connection with defector cases. The LISMPTY material also keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which Soviet officers have been in the Sabassy, which ones bave been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact with whom; and other similar information useful in the conduct of Soviet operations.

Problems:

1. A security problem has developed involving Raymond H. GERENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife wants a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of personalities. The problem basically is that both want custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute that has become more bitter and violent daily. In addition, the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problem is compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in some considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behalf of the Agency. Thus, if the case does go to court, it could lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP. Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could expose hin as an Agency employee. Since late 1969, Mexico City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the project. After weighing all factors, it has been decided that continued employment of GERINDE is not an acceptable risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him by the end of FY 1970. GERENDE will be paid a termination bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her from revealing what she knows about project operations. The FY 1970 budget is being amended to cover this amount.

2. Other aspects of security continue relatively unchanged. All the agents still have jobs to backstop their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away from the target area. Occasionally emergency meetings are called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD also meets LIEMPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places. FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4 directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been given a special extension in the Station through which he may call as "Dr. Carlos" to leave a message for "Victor" (FERNALD). The Station case officer maintains weekly clandestine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the operation and collect the product.

Coordination:

Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project LIEMPTY.

Future Plans:

1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to produce valuable information in the form of photographic coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet officials. Operational procedures and the project mechanism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce H. FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).

2. The Project does not include an up-dated plan for emergency contact during violent action or government overthrow. The Station has been requested to prepare an up-dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

Costs:

1.  General: $23,635 are requested for FY 1971. It
    is requested that the project be amended for FY 1970 in the
    amount of $10,498 (from $38,970 to $49,468) in order to
    cover termination payments to Raymond H. GERENDE and his
    wife, LIEMPTY-19.

2.  Source of Funds: Project LIEMPTY is included in
    the Western Hemisphere Division's FY 1971 Operating Program
    in the amount of $40,000. Funds for the FY 1970 amendment
    will be absorbed in the current WH Division's finance
    allocation.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH : MPS/BG

SUBJECT : Renewal of Project LIEMPTY

1. WH Division requests renewal of Mexico City Station's Operational Support Project, LIEMPTY, for $23,635 for Fiscal Year 1971 and a $10,498 amendment for FY 1970 to cover termination payments to a former Principal Agent and his wife. Last year LIEMPTY was approved for $38,970. One agent termination and the transfer of the cost of a mobile surveillance unit to another project are responsible for the reduced FY 1971 request.

2. LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It includes a Principal Agent, Raymond H. GERENDE (P), and 6 subagents who maintain two separate safehouses, one in front and one in the rear of the Soviet Embassy, from which anyone entering or leaving the Embassy can be observed and photographed. The various members of the team handle and service the photographic equipment, develop and print photographs, keep observation reports, and logs, including the arrival and departure of target persons, and maintain the two safehouses mentioned above.

3. This project does not provide positive intelligence, except incidentally. It is designed to furnish a running account, both photographic and in writing, of all Soviet Embassy personnel and their visitors arriving at, or leaving, the Embassy. Photographs taken by LIEMPTY personnel were used to produce an updated "mugbook" on Soviet officials in Mexico which has been loaned to other US security agencies for operational use in activities targeted against Soviet services in Mexico City. LIEMPTY agents also provided information which enabled the Station to identify the companions of known KGB officials, to identify the habit patterns of new arrivals at the Soviet Embassy and provided a wealth of other information of operational value concerning Soviet Embassy activities.

4. A security problem, resulting in a Station decision to restrict the activities of GERENDE, place him on half pay, and replace him with a career agent (a valuable asset who

also handles SB operations) arose during the project year. GERENDE has been having marital difficulties which may end in divorce. Along with other incompatible features of the marriage, which have resulted in numerous family fights, there have been long, bitter and violent arguments as to who will have custody of their 4 children and concerning a monetary settlement. The Station has become involved in these altercations because GERENDE's wife is knowledgeable of his CIA relationship and could, if she chose to do so, expose him as an agency employee. She has promised to keep quiet but there is no assurance that she will do so. In view of the risk involved, should GERENDE's wife expose his agency relationship and in view of the fact that, despite his 15 years of service and his undisputed ability and experience, other unfavorable qualities militate against his retention, the Station is considering terminating GERENDE. It is proposed to pay him a termination bonus of $10,000 for 15 years of service in accordance with Mexican law and his wife $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her quiet. After discussion with the desk, FI Staff believes that, if GERENDE is paid the $10,000 termination money, it should not be given to him in one lump sum but should be paid on a monthly basis, the amount per month to be determined by the Station, thus eliminating the possibility of his squandering it all at once and possibly coming back for more of the same. The same procedure should be followed in the $2,500 payment to his wife. In both cases at least an element of control is assured in that both GERENDE and his wife will know that continued receipt of their monthly payments will depend upon their continued loyalty to the agency. In the meantime, we feel this man, whose morale, and ability have been seriously affected by his marital strife, given time, can perhaps be rehabilitated and once again become a valuable Station asset. This would ensure his continued loyalty and give him an income out of which to pay his alimony. Aside from the foregoing there were no other problems, security or otherwise. All meetings between the case officer and the new Principal Agent are held under secure conditions, or more often if necessary, at prearranged dates, times and places. Meetings between the P/A and the subagents are held under similar conditions. The Station has been requested to submit an updated emergency re- contact plan to be included in the first FY 1971 quarterly program report for this project.

5. Agents' salaries, safehouse rentals, motor vehicle maintenance and travel, property maintenance and Christmas bonuses will total $23,635. Despite the security aspects related to the marital difficulties of the erstwhile P/A,

this is an excellent operation which has been described by the Station as representing a highly effective and highly useful support mechanism. SB Division has stated that, although relatively inexpensive, it is a very worthwhile and valuable project. FI Staff recommends approval with the stipulation that the recommendation with respect to payment of termination bonuses to GERENDE and his wife be carried out.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH : MPS/BG

SUBJECT : FY 1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970

1. Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican Station's operation which provides visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance and back of the building, as well as from a mobile unit. All Soviet personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed. From 1 November 1967 to 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photographs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were completed by personnel in this project. SB Division is pleased with the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds them useful for operational purposes against the SB target. During the past year several U.S. citizens entered the Soviet installation in Mexico City and their photographs were identified by the FBI. There is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City and appropriately sterilized photographs are passed locally.

2. There have been no significant security problems.

3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and termination of the agent who attended it. No real loss resulted from this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse. The agent who serviced the facility was getting too old to do an efficient job and was terminated amicably. Also during the past year a new agent was added to the project.

4. Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse rental and maintenance amounts to $6,188; maintenance of two vehicles, $1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,500. FY 1969 approval was for $43,520 and estimated obligations for this period are $43,500. A new, $5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year.

5. Project LIEMPTY contributes substantially to the Mexican Station's SB effort. The occasional identification of U.S. nationals in contact with the Soviets could have an important bearing on National Security. The operation is handled by an experienced and capable, outside contract agent under the direction of a Station officer which provides good security and personnel economy. It is a well managed and productive operational support mechanism necessary to Station operations. FI Staff recommends approval.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal (FY 1970)

1. Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for the period 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) in the amount of $38,970. Funds are available in WH Division. $45,000 was programmed for FY 1970.

2. LIEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operations of the Mexico City Station. It provides for two basehouses, a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy. Presently, two fixed surveillance points near the Embassy provide the location from which the photographs are taken and observers arė stationed. One basehouse is adjacent to the rear of the Embassy, where Soviet officials meet, play and work. The other basehouse is across the street from the front of the Embassy and gives a direct view of every person entering or leaving. There is also a mobile photographic unit (a VW van) which is now used in support of all Mexico City Station operations and in conjunction with the LIEMBRACE surveillance team (used primarily against Soviet targets). Raymond H. GERENDE, an indigenous contract agent, is the principal agent of the operation and meets daily with the basehouse keepers and subagents.

3. LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's Soviet operations program and is considered an essential element of the Station's support apparatus. During the period 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photographs were taken. In response to a request to SB Division for an evaluation of the project, the following comment was received: "There are few such sources of high resolution photographs of Soviets, especially giving good side views. These photos are welcomed by SB Division since they furnish a steady flow of up-to-date identity data..." The photos are useful to the Station in confirming the identities of Soviet personnel and visitors to the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 71

SECRET

Embassy, some of whom are U. S. citizens. During the past year, several of these U. S. citizens were identified with the help of the photos (which were passed to the FBI). Furthermore, the movements and habits of the Soviets are studied, and more knowledge is acquired on their friends and associates, especially Mexican nationals. This information is useful in target studies. For example, the senior TASS representative, a known KGB officer, is a recruitment target. He is under intensive operational scrutiny for leads developed from knowledge of his activities and contacts. LIEMPTY support is an integral part of this current developmental activity.

4. During the past year, one of the three basehouses was closed, leaving two, and the agent attending it was terminated. This was done because the agent was becoming less effective with age, and because there was some overlap between the photos taken from this basehouse and those of another. The termination was amicable, and the working hours of the personnel of the other basehouse were extended slightly. Another agent was also hired to help. This new agent is of the same family as the rest of the personnel occupying the basehouse, and no additional security risks are anticipated from this addition.

5. There have been no security or administrative problems. The Station and GERENDE are constantly on the alert for any sign that the Soviets are aware of the surveillance activities. While it is quite possible that the Soviets are aware of the surveillance, so far indications are that they are at least not fully aware, since no effort is made by them to avoid being photographed, even when having meetings with contacts in the rear of the Embassy.

6. Approval is recommended of this valuable operational support project.

COMMENT FOR INTERNAL STAFF USE (Not to go forward to the Division)

COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (To go forward to the Division)

The CI Staff concurs in the renewal of this extremely valuable project. The Staff strongly urges that the Station continue to be constantly alert for any Sov. interest in the project's agents and installations and in particular any Sov. investigation or activities against same--also, Station contingency plans should be formulated to cope with such Sov. interest or activities.

PROJECT BRIEFING
MPS/BG/FI
8 May 68

PROJECT: LIEMPTY
WII - Mexico
ACTION: ADD/P approval of renewal (19 mos.)
1 Dec 67 - 30 Jun 69

PURPOSE: An operational support project providing three basehouses and a mobile surveillance unit to monitor primarily the Soviet Embassy, its personnel and its visitors, by physical and photographic surveillance.

BACKGROUND: The project covers three properties near the Soviet Embassy (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried out. It also covers a darkroom and a mobile photographic truck. Some of the project personnel are used at times for miscellaneous support tasks such as servicing postal boxes and for counter-surveillance and other protective services.

PROGRESS: During the past year the project provided nearly all of the operational photographs and physical surveillance reports used in the Station's operations against the Soviet Embassy and its personnel. SB Division says, "This rather unique operation has unquestionably made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet Operations program of the Mexico Station."

The project produces primarily operational data and counterintelligence information. It provides leads, evidence of which Soviet officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away, who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out of the building with whom. (One photograph from this project was used in the Warren Commission Report.)

FUNDS: $69,725 (19 mos.) (Programmed FY 69 $46,000)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: MPS/BG

SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY

1. WH Division requests renewal of LIEMPTY for the 19-month period 1 December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in the amount of $69,725. While this represents a slight reduction on a pro rata basis from the $45,000 for which LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting 1 December 1966, it reflects a proportionately modest increase in cost for the 19-month renewal period over the estimated total disbursement of $40,130 for the past project year. This will provide for small salary increases to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents involved in the project who have not received raises in some time as well as for slightly higher rental fees for the various basehouses. The project, now in its tenth year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection of operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, including the identification and movements of its personnel and visitors. To this end, LIEMPTY provides for the maintenance and exploitation of three basehouses for fixed visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and a mobile basehouse in the form of a. panel truck used for mobile photography against the Polish Embassy, leaders and meeting sites of local communist parties, and other targets of opportunity. An important corollary objective of LIEMPTY is operational support in the form of countersurveillance for Agency personnel and operations, including those of other bases and stations as the needs and requirements of the Mexico Station permit. The funds requested include $43,520 for the period 1 December 1967 through 30 November 1968 and an additional $26,205 to cover the period 1 December 1968 through 30 June 1969. The latter funds are asked for in a supple- mental request to put the project on a fiscal year basis.

2. A long-term contract agent and eight other support agents are involved in the management and operation of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

LIEMPTY facilities and in surveillance activities directed
at the primary Soviet target. Some of these agents are
used also in dark room photographic processing, letter
drop, and, on occasion, moving surveillance activities.

3. This project is only part of the complex of
   Mexico City Station instruments for meeting requirements
   from a number of U.S. agencies, including the FBI. It
   is clearly an effective, well-managed support operation
   serving important needs.

4. No major or significant changes in LIEMPTY
   personnel or operational techniques have been introduced
   nor have there been any known incidents adversely
   affecting the security of the project or its personnel
   since the previous project renewal period. As a uni-
   lateral operational support effort, LIEMPTY continues to
   be a most useful station asset supporting a number of
   station activities. In spite of small increases in costs
   as discussed above, the project is considered to be holding
   the line on cost and personnel.

5. The objectives of project LIEMPTY are in direct
   support of priority A objectives 1, 2, and 4 of the current
   Operating Directive for Mexico. It is considered by SB
   Division to have made significant contributions to the
   Station's well developed, high priority Soviet Operations
   Program. During the past year the various LIEMPTY base-
   house installations produced valuable information in the
   form of photographic coverage and physical surveillance
   reports on the daily movements, personal associations and
   habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.
   In numerous instances this coverage confirmed the specific
   intelligence service connections of Soviet officers in the
   Embassy. Often the identities of Mexicans and nationals of
   other countries in contact with the Soviets were estab-
   lished. The mobile panel truck unit was exploited regu-
   larly to provide information on not only the Soviets but
   also the Cuban target as well as local Communist Party
   targets.

## PROJECT: LIEMPTY

ACTION: ADD/P approval of renewal

WH - Mexico City
1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 67

PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy and a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders.

PROGRESS: Three basehouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) provide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy. Throughout the past renewal period each operational component contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the operational tasks levied on the Station. In the first nine-month period approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1,000 individual photographs. Of particular value were photographs of local and exile Communist leaders. Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY. His overall operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project case officer.

PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/1, who owns a small store near the Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached him and asked him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly the Soviet named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC. However, in view of LICOW L's previous history of lying, it is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just what LICOWL/1 may have told them. The Station is still looking into this development.

STAFF COMMENTS: FI and CI Staffs concur in renewal.

CI STAFF: Strongly urges the Station to continue its close monitoring of Soviet interest in the installation buildings and attempts to obtain information on sensitive project personalities. The Station should devise necessary contingency plans of action to eliminate any security hazards if it is determined that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be getting "too close" to the project installations, personalities and activities.

8 JAN 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: NFS/BG

SUBJECT: Project LIEMITY

1. This action seeks renewal of Project LIEMITY covering Mexico City Station's stationary surveillance basehouses aimed against the Soviet Embassy. The activity will cost $45,000 for the period 1 December 1966 to 30 November 1967. Approval is recommended.

2. Project LIEMITY has been in being for six years. At present it supports three stationary basehouses near the Soviet Embassy and a mobile photographic basehouse. These are used to obtain photographic coverage and logs of Soviet movements and visitors to the Soviet Embassy. The mobile basehouse is used also to cover meeting sites of the local communist parties and targets of opportunity.

3. A principal agent and eight agents are used in the LIEMITY activity. The agents are variously employed as basehouse keepers, photo lab technicians and surveillance operators.

4. Security has been generally good although one incident occurred in mid 1966 which may have some impact on the future security of the operation. An approach was made to an agent of the Station, who owns a small store near the Soviet Embassy, to report on his neighbors among whom are some of the LIEMITY agents. One, LIEMITY-9-6, was mentioned by name. The Station is watching this development carefully.

5. The LIEMITY activity proved its worth during the past year when check was made on conflicting stories told by two Station agents. The LIEMITY surveillance reports proved that one of the agents was lying about his contacts with the Soviets. LIEMITY is well managed and continues to serve an important Mexico City Station need.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1. It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be renewed for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for a total of $45,000: $29,020 for FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968. The Project is included in the FY 1967 Operational Program for $45,000. Funds are available within WIH Division.

2. LIEMPTY covers stationary surveillance basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy. These basehouses provide photographic coverage and logs. Two of the basehouses (LIMITED and LILYRIC) cover the activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides coverage of the back courtyard area. The LIEMPTY project also covers a mobile photographic basehouse in the form of a panel truck which is used against the Polish Embassy where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and against other targets of opportunity.

3. The value of Soviet Embassy photographic coverage during the past year was proven when the logs maintained by LILYRIC were used to double check on an operation involving LIRUSTIC-1 and LICOWL-1 who had told conflicting stories of certain events concerning the activity of some Soviets. Through the surveillance reports of the LIEMPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy, it was proven without a doubt that LICOWL-1 (who had just taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying about his contacts with the Soviets.

4. The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was targeted against leaders and meeting sites of the local Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity, particularly exile Communist leaders now residing in Mexico. LIENTRAP provided up-dated identification

photographs of Communist officers which are of value to both the JMTIGER program and the Station's recruitment/penetration program. The LIENTRAP personnel also regularly service twenty-one postal accommodation addresses used by the Mexico City Station.

5. One development which may affect the security of the LIEMPTY basehouses of LIMITED and LILYRIC occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-1 (who owns a small store near the Soviet Embassy) reported that a Soviet official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and requested him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly the Soviet named LIEMPTY-6 (of the LIMITED basehouse) by name and also indicated all the tenants (unnamed) of the new building which now houses LILYRIC. The Soviet pinpointed the building by saying the one being built by a person who fit perfectly the description of LIMOUSINE. LICOWL-1 did not indicate that the Soviet reflected any interest in LIMOUSINE. The occupants of the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned. LICOWL-1 indicated to his Station contact that the only person he really suspected in the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6 (of LIMITED) who doesn't go to work, is always typing, lives comfortably, and owns a car, He claims to have heard it rumored that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the Americans. (Since LIMITED is equipped with a radio and tips off the Station's surveillance team when it is used against Soviet targets, Headquarters has already assumed that the Soviets have identified this basehouse.) LICOWL-1 also listed several persons named by the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever with CIA.

6. The Station instructed LICOWL-1 not to become an informant on his neighbors. According to LICOWL-1, he therefore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to collect the information the Soviet wanted. However, in view of the lies LICOWL-1 has been caught in, it is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked of LICOWL-1 and just what LICOWL-1 may have told the Soviets.. The Station is still looking into this development.

7. WHD recommends renewal of this Project.

PROJECT BRIEFING

PROJECT: LIEMPTY WH - Mexico

ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal 1 Dec 65 - 30 Nov 66

PURPOSE: To provide support for mobile and stationary photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and a dispatching base for a physical surveillance team.

PROGRESS: Assets included under the project include three base- houses which provide front and rear views of the Soviet Embassy, and a panel truck equipped for spot photo coverage. Raymond H. GERENDE (p), principal agent, meets the basehouse keepers regularly, maintains regular contact with the mobile photo unit and with the develop- ing and processing base. He also performs many other support functions.

The photographs from all these operations have been of value to the Station in operational planning, for identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, and for Headquarters permanent files. The Station believes that this operation is essential to the fulfillment of the overall operational program levied on the Station by the RMD.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: DDP/PG

SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY Renewal

*.4 FEB 1965

1. FI Staff recommends approval of the renewal of Project LIEMPTY. This project, costed at $41,500., supports the following Mexico City assets: a panel truck used for mobile photography, three base houses for fixed photographic surveillance, a contract agent manager and eight support agents. One of the base homes is used as a control point to dispatch a surveillance team. (The latter is not a part of the project, however.)

2. The LIEMPTY target is the Soviet Embassy and Soviet activities in Mexico City. LIEMPTY is part of the complex of station instruments by means of which requirements from a variety of U.S. agencies are met. One of the sites provided pictures later used in the Warren Comission Report, and the publication of the report created a security hazard. The Station moved the site and it is now back in operation.

3. The possibility of Soviet intercept of radio commo to the surveillance team has been carefully weighed recently by SR, the desk, O/C and TSD. The decision to accept the risk appears to have been taken with due deliberation.

4. This is clearly an effective, well-managed operation serving an important need. We recommend renewal without hesitation.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY Renewal Request

1. Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966 for a total of $41,500; of this amount, $25,520 should be alloted for FY 1966 and $15,980 for FY 1967. This Project has been programmed in FY 1966 for $50,000. The last Project Renewal was approved at $45,300. Funds are available within WIH Division.

2. The security of this Project appears to be good. The LIENTRAP photo truck was repainted a different color in January 1965 to preserve the security of this vehicle which operates extensively in the same general areas. There have been no apparent ramifications from the publication of the LIMITED Photograph in the Warren Commission Report in September 1964.

3. LIENTRAP is one of two mobile photo surveillance units at the Station, both of which are used extensively because of the many requirements for spot photo coverage of diplomatic installations, agent meetings, and current identification photos of targets among others.

4. Although there are three stationary photo baschouses under this Project all targeted against the Soviet Embassy, there is very little duplication of effort, and the coverage of this Embassy would be weakened through the termination of any of them. LICALLA covers the rear of the Embassy (garden and parking lot) and is in a unique position to observe informal meetings and activity there. In May 1965 a thorough assessment was made of this basehouse to determine whether an audio installation could be based here, directed against these garden conversations. It was determined that due to the high incidence of street and other noises, this was not practical. TSD and SR Divisions are conscious of this requirement, however, and if any new equipment is developed which might make this operation more feasible it will be tested. LIMITED and LILYRIC which both cover the front entrance, provide coverage during different parts of the day, and LIMITED also serves as a fixed radio

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

dispatching base for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team.

5. The photographs from all these operations are of value to the Station in their operational planning, for identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, which are often used by surveillance teams and singleton agents in identifying Soviets, and for lleadquarter's permanent files.

6. With reference to the FI Staff comment made last year at the time of the Project renewal that the radio dis- patching from the LIMITED installation might have made this base a target for the RIS, the problem was discussed in depth with the. Office of Communications, TSD, and SR Divisions. The Station has been alert to the Soviet's monitoring capability and they have developed a signaling system and inter- car communications system that will leave the LIEMBRACE surveillance cars on the air for a minimum of time, and with limited open conversation. The result of Headquarters and the. Station's research on this problem resulted in the conclusion that, if a surveillance team is to operate with automobiles, radios must be used if there is to be efficient surveillance, and regardless of what presently available type of scrambling or coding is used, radio is susceptible to monitoring by the opposition. It was therefore concluded that if the Station is to use the LIEMBRACE tean against members of the Soviet installation, LIMITED must continue to be used as the radio dispatching center and the risk factor must be accepted until some new, more secure yet efficient commo system is devised.

7. The reporting on the administration of this Project is handled through regular quarterly progress reports. The appropriate Soviet, CP, or other Case Officers handle the reporting and exploitation of the product. During the past year there were no positive intelligence reports from this Project.

8. Both SR and Wll Divisions recommend renewal of this Project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief of Operations, DD/P

SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY (Renewal)

WH - Mexico City

1.  The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1960 through 30 November 1961. The project provides for physical and photographic surveillance operations in support and exploitation of other Mexico City Station operations, particularly those targetted at Soviet personnel and installations.

2.  Authority is requested to obligate $53,000 from the DD/P-WH Division budget: $31,900 in fiscal year 1961, and $21,100 in fiscal year 1962, subject to the availability of funds. The amount includes $38,000 compensation for two principal agents, one clerical support agent on an hourly basis, and eleven surveillance and support agents; $7,000 operational expenses (safehouse procurement, post office boxes, rented automobiles, purchase of information, vehicle maintenance, and operational travel); $2,500 replacement, repair and maintenance of photographic equipment; and $5,500 basehouse rental, utilities, and maintenance.

3.  The field's renewal request, supported by a covering memorandum of the Division, sets forth accomplishments of the project in the past year in terms of objectives and estimates effectiveness. It is noted that one principal agent, Simon D. CLACKETT (p), resigned in October 1960, and the four-man surveillance team previously handled by him will be transferred to project LITEMPO, consequently being omitted from LIEMPTY in this renewal. Three basehouses continue to be operated under the project: (a) LIMITED, which compiles daily logs on arrivals and departures from the LIMERICK installation, together with attendance lists of LIMERICK employees, and handles the radio dispatch of the LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets

of opportunity. This basehouse also provides photographic coverage, concentrated on visitors. (b) LILYRIC which provides clandestine photographs particularly of visitors to, as well as employees of, the LIMERICK installation, prepares weekly reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, and reports on license numbers of all cars visiting the installation. (c) LICALLA, which concentrates on photographic coverage of LIMERICK employees and their families, as well as providing observation on the apparent positions and jobs of the target employees, and as well as personnel changes. Additional photographic coverage is provided by the mobile LIENTRAP vehicle. Principal agent Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continues to coordinate basehouse activities; principal agent Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) continues to be an independent asset used to follow-up and exploit operational information on target personnel and installations, to case various installations of interest, to acquire property, etc. SCANTLING has managed the surveillance team being transferred to LITEMPO in the interim following the resignation of CLACKETT. The Station notes that activities at the LICALLA basehouse were suspended in September 1960 as the result of the arrest of a knowledgeable TSD technician in another area and it is not known precisely when it will be possible to resume these operations. The Station believes that the GERENDE segment is now operating under optimum arrangements and SCANTLING will soon be relieved from his interim responsibility for the surveillance team being transferred to LITEMPO and can concentrate more on his investigative and casing activities. It is not planned in the coming year to expand project activities.

4. Appropriate Special Stafr components concur in recommending renewal. FI Staff notes the Division's assurance that the transfer of the unilateral surveillance team to LITEMPO will not affect its independent status, and remarks that the current project review presents a clearer picture of the usefulness of the several segments than the previous one.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief of Operations, DD/P

SUBJECT : Project LIMFTY (Renewal)

Wil - Mexico

1. The attached project, originating in Wil Division, is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1959 through 31 November 1960. The project provides for physical and photo- graphic surveillance operations in support and exploitation of other Mexico City operations, particularly those targetted at Soviet personnel and installations.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $34,910 from the DD/P-Wil Division operating budget: $49,430 for fiscal year 1960 and $36,425 for fiscal 1961, subject to the availability of funds. These sums include $31,210 compensation for five contract agents (three of whom serve as principal agents for segments of the project), and sixteen support agents; $3,500 for vehicle maintenance and commercial carrier travel; $7,500 for operational equipment: $5,000 for maintenance of three safehouses; $2,000 for additional safehouse, post office box, and vehicle rental; $1,000 exchange commodities; $2,000 key money, broken contracts, etc.; and $2,000 for the purchase of information, documents, payment of bribes, etc.

3. The attached renewal request, prepared in the Division and supported by a project review prepared in the Field, reviews the activities of the project during the past year and present a detailed breakdown the funds requested. The project operates in three segments: (a) Contract agent Oliver G. SCANTLING is an independent asset who is used to follow-up and exploit operational information on target personnel and installa- tions, to ease various installations of interest, acquire pro- perty, etc.; (b) a photographic surveillance team, under prin- cipal agent Raymond H. GENEROS, utilizing three houses or apart- ments and one photo truck; and (c) a physical surveillance team under principal agent Simon D. BLACKETT, consisting of three trained members at the present time. The attached renewal request reviews the activities and accomplishments of the pro- ject in terms of these three segments and in relation to pro- ject objectives. SCANTLING's contribution to the collection of operational information pertaining to Soviet personnel and installations is regarded by the Station as unique. He also

trained CLACKETT in radio controlled mobile surveillance. SCANTLING also has rendered valuable support to the LITACIT operation having gained entr; to the target under a rabri- cated cover. He has also esses and prepared reports on the LITABEY target in preparation ser future eperations and per- formed investigations of numerous other ১tation targets of opportunity. lic investigated many leads from other audio- surveillance operations chabling the station to maintain current data on various series contacts and resulting in a recruitment attempt whten, wie unsuccessful, is believed to indicate future potentiel along this line. He has rur- ther been used to develop rate procedures for the mobile teams and to rent various properties in support of other Station operations. The Gregment, using three base houses for photography, produces upwards of 12,000 photo- graphs during the car. One base has recently begun taking motion pictures of Soviet personnel in the course of conver- sation which have been terversed to FI/D ror possible exploita- tion by lip reading analysis. This segment cise operates the mobile radio surveillance vehteles. A mobile photography sur- veillance truck has been uses during the project sear for coverage of various Station targets which do net warrant the establishment of permanent photographic bases. GERENDE has also served to rent post office boves, hotel rooms, etc., in support of other Station operations. During the past project year CLACKETT, who returned to Fexico in early April 1959 after Headquarters training, spent the following two months being trained by SCARTLING in mobile surveillance techniques. He then undertook training or a four member team which was Judged ready for operational use toward the end of the project year. Two additional contrast agents, Wilma J. FIORDALISI and Louise J. MACRIKO, performed translation and support functions.

4.  Appropriate staff components concur in recommending renewal.

(a) CI Staff notes that the CI value of the project is difficult to judre since it appears that much of the material produced remains in the Station for exploita- tion. Ilowever, CI Stact remarks that the value of the project should be increased when the CACKETT surveil- lance team enters into scrive operation. Gi Staff sug- gests that the Station be queried as to the pretext or circumstances under which SoANTLING frequently visits Inez Porada de Koreno, the occupant of the property adjacent to the Soviet Installation.

(b) FI/OPS notes that while the project review presents a clear picture of the aims and objectives of the various segments, it does not provide, except in the case of SCANTLING, detailed indication of the value or usefulness of the other segments, particularly the photographic activity. FI/OPS requests that the Station provide such an appraisal during the first quarter of 1960. FI/OPS recommends strongly that the photo coverage be reviewed from the standpoint of value and usefulness with a view to determining whether the LILYRIC activity could not be safely eliminated and the additional photographic coverage conducted on a more selective basis, without materially affecting overall usefulness. FI/OPS notes that, in the absence of further proof of usefulness, the color photography and moving pictures appear to be an unnecessary luxury. FI/OPS commends the careful handling of the CLACKETT segment and requests that the next project action include examples of the team's progress.

5. I recommend renewal of Project LIEMPTY as presented with attention to the staff comments in paragraph 4 above.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY Amendment

HEADQUARTERS CASE OFFICER:
Name: J. B. Brady
Room: 2114 Barton all
Ext.: 2555
Date: 23 June 1959

1. It is requested that approval be granted to amend Raymond H. GERENDE's contract to provide him with a termination settlement of one month's salary for each full year that he works for KUBARK and to raise his salary effective July 1959 from $4,030 to $4,560.00 per year. His last salary increase was granted on 1 September 1957. The date, 18 March 1955, has been suggested by the Station as the beginning date for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits. The Station believes that this benefit will provide GERENDE with the necessary incentive to make KUBARK a career and at the same time will give the Station an additional element of control.

2. As pointed out in the LIEMPTY Project Approval, GERENDE, an indigenous agent, is one of the Station's most valuable assets. He has a responsible full time job as the LIEPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA base houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and translation service and all the agents participating in these activities. He performs his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent abilities are showing continued improvement.

3. Money was already allocated in the LIEPTY Project approval for the salary increase. With the effective date of 13 March 1955, for the termination clause, GERECS will already have accrued $1,520 (his salary is $4,560 per year) if he should resign today. The LIEMPTY Project, as approved, has sufficient funds to cover this cost if it is necessary to obligate this amount during the present Project year. Therefore, no additional funds are requested.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief of Foreign Intelligence

SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY (Amendment)
WH - Mexico City

1. The attached project, originating in the WH Division, provides the services of a surveillance activity to support Mexico City operations and is approved for the period 1 December 1958 through 30 November 1959. It is presented for your approval of amendment to include the addition of a contract agent, Louise J. MACRINO, to furnish administrative support, and also to formalize a special commitment made to one of the two principal agents, Oliver G. SCANTLING. A contract prepared in the Field and signed by the agent permits the payment of one year's salary to him or his assigned heirs in event of loss of life or total disability if incurred in the performance of duty. This has not previously been included in the project.

2. The LISMPTY project has authorization for the expenditure of $95,380. No additional funds are required for the amendment. Sufficient funds remain in the project to absorb the salary expenses for MACRINO and funds to cover the extra year's salary for SCANTLING will not be requested until such time as they are needed.

3. Memoranda prepared in the WH Division supporting the request for amendment are attached, summarizing the important factors involved. These detail SCANTLING's performance and provide a resume of MACRINO's past activities in behalf of the Agency.

4. Staff Components have concurred in amendment to Project LIEMPTY.

5. I recommend approval of amendment of Project LIMPTY as presented.

Special Benefit for Oliver G.
SCANTLING (ps) and to Include
Louise J. MACHIDO (ps)

HEADQUARTERS CASE OFFICER:

NAME J. E. Frady
ROOM 211h Barton Hall
EXT. 2555 or 3152
DATE 5 March 1959

1. It is requested that approval be granted to give Oliver G. SCANTLING a special benefit of one year's salary to him or his assigned heirs in the event of loss of life or total disability if incurred in the performance of duty. This benefit was included in a contract prepared in the field and signed by Subject on 15 February 1957. The contract was not submitted to Headquarters for approval until December 1958. The Station and WH Division do not want to delete this benefit from Subject's contract at this time and we feel Subject deserves this benefit.

2. SCANTLING, a civil engineer, is a Mexican citizen, who is 40 years old. He was granted an Operational Approval on 2 December 1954. SCANTLING began his employment with MUSARK as a footman on the LIPSTICK physical surveillance team and gradually became a driver of a surveillance automobile, then team leader. As team leader he was responsible for the operational deployment and administrative direction of the entire LIPSTICK team, three automobiles, four photographic and radio dispatching basehouses and the attendant mobile and stationary radio equipment. He collated the fragmentary surveillance reports into finished intelligence reports for study by the Case Officer. SCANTLING developed into a fine investigator and has obtained information where other Station investigative ascets have failed.

3. Almost all of SCANTLING's time now is spent following up leads obtained from telephone intercepts and photographic surveillances. From July through December 1958 he made approaches to individuals performing services for the Soviet Embassy and he made a detailed casing report of the West German Embassy. In addition, ha conducted mary routine investigations and surveillances. The Station plans to have SCA TLING attempt to recruit the landlord of the proposed basehouse for a LINIMENT (FI/D) operation. SCANTLING no longer nandles the surveillance team and the Station plans to continue to use him as an independent asset. SCANTLING has in his possession official credentials of the Federal Security Police (DES). He has used these credentials in making contacts with targets of various sensitive Headquarters' operations (i.e., LCMAYFOWL).

4. As a graduate engineer who has spent at least ten years in house construction in Mexico, ha nas been invaluable to the Station in submitting detailed casing reports, including detailed and professional plans of technical targets. He has been commended by TSS for the support role he has played for them. He has submitted several casing reports on the Soviet Embassy and is an unparalleled source of information to the Station for information about the Embassy's construction activities, modifications and reasons for save.

5. For your information there is attached the Station's review of SCANTLING for the period July through December 1958. It is believed you will find this report of interest and further support the justification outlined above for the granting to SCANTLING of the special death and disability benefit. This agent assessment states "Oliver O. SCANTLING has continued to perform his assigned tasks in an outstanding manner. SCANTLING's poise, common sense, education, ideology, and native ability for the pursuit of clandestine activities make him one of the most valuable support assets available to the Mexico City Station. The fact that SCANTLING has a full time overt occupation as Chief Engineer and Production Manager for a local manufacturing company adds to his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent". SCANTLING has excellent cover as half-owner of a local firm which manufactures farm instruments and he represents the high calibre of person which KUBARK requires for the institution of their long-term resident agent program.

6. The LIEMPTY Project (now approved for $95,350) will not be amended at this time to include an extra year's salary for SCANTLING ($4,000). In the event it becomes necessary to fulfill this commitment during the project year, and if the expense cannot be absorbed by the present project authorization, an amendment will be submitted.

7. It is also requested that effective 1 March 1959 the LIEMPTY Project be amended to include LouiseJ. MACKINO, a Contract Agent, who is a Station support asset. Her OA was reinstated on 8 August 1958 (C-4152). She was formerly included under Project LIFEAT. However, the Station requirements for general translation work increased to the extent that it was necessary to use MACHINO to translate reports other than those originating from LIFEAT. It was therefore decided it would be more appropriate to include her under LIEMPTY. She does typing of reports and non-sensitive translations. She is paid on an hourly basis of $2.02, an estimated yearly salary of $3,500. The Station stated that the present LIEMPTY Project could absorb the expanse of her salary for the remainder of the Project year.

MEMORANDUM FUR: Chief of Operations, DD/P

SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY (Approval)
WH - Mexico City
16 JAN 1959

1.  The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented for your approval for an initial period from 1 December 1958 through 30 November 1959. The project provides for the development of operational information through physical and photographic surveillance operations in support of other Mexico City operations, particularly those targetted at Soviet personnel and installations. Previously these operations were conducted for the most part under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY. They are incorporated in this new project because of the June 1958 compromise of LIPSTICK and to accomplish a more orderly administration of certain operational support assets.

2.  Authority is requested to obligate $95,380 from the DD/P-WH Division operating budget: $65,580 for the current fiscal year and $29,800 in fiscal year 1960, subject to the availability of funds. These estimates include: (a) funds for the compensation of the presently- recruited fifteen action and support agents, six new agents, and two principal agents: Raymond H. GERENDE (p) (LIEMPTY/1, formerly LIPSTICK/20) and Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) (LIEMPTY/2, formerly LIPSTICK/19); (b) funds for the compensation, travel, allowances and Headquarters' training of two contract agents, Simon D. CLACKETT (p) and Wilma J. FIORDALISI (p), his wife, who are hereby transferred from Project LIMESA; (c) funds for operational expenses and equipment, including the purchase of four new or used vehicles as replacements for previously authorized vehicles and their maintenance, and a SP vehicle for SCANTLING; (d) the rent, utilities and maintenance of safehouses; and, (e) other appropriate operational expenses.

3.  The attached Field Project Outline, a covering memorandum from the Division, and an addendum to the Project Outline, review the personnel assets and facilities transferred from the LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY operations following the partial compromise of LIPSTICK in June 1958 and describe the concept of the physical and photographic surveillance operations to be conducted under this project directed primarily at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. These surveillances provide photographs and other operational data of persons entering and leaving the building or present in the garden area, and through additional foot and mobile surveillances, investigative information concerning their contacts and destinations. Agent personnel, particularly the principal agents, are used also to conduct separate investigations, make recruit-approaches to

individuals of operational interest, and to rent rooms, and apartments and perform other support activities. The fixed surveillance bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, have been in operation for almost three years without having been in any compromising situations insofar as the Station knows. The LIPSTICK unit, a panel truck equipped with cameras, etc., is considered a particularly valuablo asset by the Field. As a replacement for a staff agent, Wilfred O. CLOWER (p), who directed and trained the LIPSTICK surveil- lance team, the husband and wife team of CLACKATT and FIORDALISI are proposed as qualified individuals to recruit, train, and direct the new LIEMPTY our- veillance team and maintain its records. Appropriate notional cover was arranged for them while in their previous project, LINESA, as they reside in Mexico under true names. One of the principal agents, GERENDE, will have no contact with the new surveillance team, but will be used to conduct special investigations, counter-surveillances, and for other support activities.

4. The CI Staff comments that LIEMPTY provides several types of physical surveillance, all of which provide information of CI interest, and as a support mechanism, a production review is not appropriate_cr_necessary. The CI Staff states further, that with the compromise of the LIPSTICK surveillance team the Mexico City Station lost its only reliable and efficient surveillance team, LIEMPTY representing the Station's effort to replace that asset. Pecause of the great number of CI targets in Mexico City, the CI Staff believes it is essential that the Station be given the opportunity, through this project, to build another surveillance team capable of operating against sensitive targets. Additionally, the CI Staff believes the case officer should work at devising ostensible sources of incomes for the agents which will stand the scrutiny of friends, relatives and less friendly forces.

5. FI/OPS suggests that the Division consider a gradual reduction of the considerable financial and personnel commitments in this project in view of the favorably developing LIENVCY liaison relationship. FI/CPS believes that a smaller, more manageable support group, with greater Station emphasis on selectivity of tasks and targets could well result in more effective CI and FI productivity.

6. I recommend approval of the project and the transfer of the contract agents as outlined above.

Request for Amendment to LIEM-TY Project

1.  It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project approval request be amended to include Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) and wilma J. FIORDALISI (ps), U. S. citizens and contract agents, under this Project in place of the Staff Agent written into the field project outline. At the same time it is requested that the LIMESA Froject be amended to delete these contract agents from the latter project.

2.  CLACKETT and FIORDALISI are now approved under the LIMESA Project. They were recruited in the United States to occupy a sensitive LIMESA base-house. Because of the sensitivity of the operation and the equipment to be installed in the basehouse Headquarters decided U. S. citizens should be used. The Station said appropriate documentation and backstopping could be secured for those agents so they could be given false identities under which they could live while they occupied the basehouse.

3.  FEXI-2777 (IN 26519), of 14 November 1958, notified Headquarters that security factors and difficulty in obtaining adequate documentation and backstopping precluded the use of U. S. citizens under LIMSA and requested permission to use indigenous agents for this operation. After discussions between John B.D., Chief of the Mexican desk, with the LIMESA/LIEMPTY Case Officer in Mexico City, and discussions between representatives of F1/D, OC, ISS, and WH at Headquarters, Headquarters concurred in the field's operational decision to use indigenous agents in the LIMESA Project. CLACRETT and FIORDALISI received only a very superficial briefing regarding the LIMESA Project. It is not believed Subject's limited knowledge of this sensitive operation will pose a security hazard.

4.  Construction on the LIMUST houses is being kept about two weeks from completion until indigenous agents can be cleared and recruited. The delay in completion is normal because all construction money in Mexico has become extremely tight because of the recent presidential inauguration.

5.  The Station believes CLACHETT will be an excellent replacement for Wilfred O. CLC.ER (ps), former Staff Agent under Project LIPSTICK, who directed and trained that surveillance team. CiLACHETT has shown a remarkable aptitude for clandestine operational activity and surveillance and investigative work in particular. He also is interested and enthusiastic in undertaking this assignment for KUB.FK. The Station needs a good bilingual agent to recruit, train, direct, and develop a strong dependable physical, surveillance team under LlEMPTY.

6.  Clearances and Contacts: CLACKETT was granted a PCSA on 23 July 1958. A POA/CA for use under LIMESA was requested on 19 Aupust 1958. FIORDALISI was granted an OA for use under LIMESA on 14 November 1958. Requests have been submitted to amend their clearances for use under LIEMPTY, CLACKETT and FIORDALISI have signed contracts effective 1 September 1958. The sensitivity of the LIMESA Project required them to leave their young son in

the United States. Because of this a special benefit of periodic trips to their home in Arizona was included in their contracts. Under LINESA their quarters were to be provided. An amendment has been requested to their contracts deleting the special benefit and adding educational and quarters allowances.

7. Motivation and Control: CLACKETT and FIORDALISI are extremely patriotic and highly motivated as evidenced in their willingness to undertake the LINESA Project and be separated from their son. They have indicated they are more than willing to do whatever is requested of them, no matter what personal sacrifices and hardships are required. Their complete livlihood is dependent on their KUänkä income.

8. Tasks: CLACKETT will recruit, train, and direct the LIEMPTY surveillance team. The Station hopes to develop this team into a major Station support asset. He will receive instructions and direction from the Station Case Officer. FIORDALISI will be used to do all the clerical and administrative work for the LIENTI surveillance team.

9. Communication and Contact: CLACKETT will contact the Station Case Officer in a clandestine manner. all necessary security precautions will be / taken. CLACKEIT will also contact his surveillance agents under a cover which will be determined later by the Station and CLACKETT. In view of his Mexican background, CLACHETT can pass as a Mexican. Details of communication and contact arrangements with AGBASK will be arranged by the Station. Under LIEMPTY CLACKETT will be contacted by the same Case Officer he is now contacted by under LIMESA. CLACKETT and FIORDALISI will be in direct contact with relatives and friends in the United States. The cover company has, until now, been serving as a letter drop and contact point for emergency messages.

10. Cover: CLACKETT and FIORDALISI entered Mexico on United States documentation and it is planned they will continue to live in Mexico under true name. CLACKETT has a notional cover as a public relations consultant which was established by CCD/NC to use with friends and relatives in the U. S. The same cover story can be adopted to cover their proposed use under EMPTY vis-a-vis their United States friends. The Station is working on local cover for CLACHETT to use in Mexico.

11. Anticipated Costs: It is anticipated that the following expenses will be incurred by CLACKETT and FICADALISI:

Compensation:

|                        |        |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| CLACKETT    ($7750/ут) | 7100   |

MEMORANDUM FOR: FI/OPS-Projects Branch

SUBJECT : Justification for Automobiles under Project LIEMPTY

1. It is requested that the Mexico City Station be authorised-to purchase three used sedans for use by the LIEMPTY surveillance team, The Station plans to expand the LIEMPTY surveillance team into a larger, well-trained physical surveillance asset. They will need three automobiles. Private automobiles or commercial transportation will not be satisfactory since the cars must be outfitted with two-way radios.

2. Authority is also requested to purchase a panel truck to be used in the LIENTRAP operation under this Project which mounts mobile photo-graphic surveillances.

3. It is also requested that a quasi-personal car be authorised for Oliver G. Scantling (ps). Scantling is an indigenous agent under oral contract. A car is a prerequisite for his work for KUBARK which includes casings, surveillances, and investigations. Because of the sensitive nature of his work, and the heavy use made of the car, the Station has decided that Scantling should be furnished a QP car.

4. LIEMPTY agents were formerly carried under the LIJERSEY and LIPSTICK Projects. The vehicles used by the LIEMPTY agents under these other Projects will be disposed of and new ones will be purchased after the above TVA has been approved. The vehicles which will be replaced are MV 2148, MV 2147, MV 2138, and MV 20il. One of the surveillance cars will be new and will not replace an old car. It was decided that these vehicles should be replaced rather than transferred to the LIEMPTY Project for security reasons and because of the age of the automobiles. The automobiles are 1951 and 1952 models and have been used for sensitive surveillance work for over two years. The panel truck which was used in the LIENTRAP Operation under the LIPSTICK Project has been operating for two years in all parts of the city and has become a security threat. The fact that the LIPSTICK surveillance team knows that the truck exists, even to the point that one of the team members is the listed owner of the truck, also dictates replacement of this vehicle.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: KOFACTOR Project Amendment and Termination

1. The KDFACTOR Project, which provided photographic surveillance from two vantage points of the Soviet compound in Mexico City, was determined to be compromised due to the VWBLANKET case. The five agents were terminated in July 1972, but the base houses could not be terminated until January 1973 because it was necessary to sell one and the termination of the second was tied to the termination of KDABBEY who owned the second base house. It was necessary to pay rent for several extra months until these other terminations could be effected.

2. The base houses and agents have now all been terminated and the Station already has rented a replacement safehouse with new agents to provide the same coverage (KDALCOVE).

3. Approval of the amendment and termination of Project KDFACTOR is recommended.

1. The CI Staff is satisfied with the fine Security Review of the KDFACTOR Project activity and personnel.

2. However, the Staff urges the Station to remain constantly alert to any security repercussions pertaining to all the terminated assets particularly in view of their past knowledge of the project activity and the fact that some of them had family and relatives who also were aware of the project activity. Focus should continue regarding any security problems pertaining to KDFACTOR-7.

3. In addition, the Station should continue to monitor any Soviet investigation or probing of owners and tenants involved in the properties used under this project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Security Review of Project KDFACTOR

1.  At the time you approved the renewal of Project KDFACTOR in December 1971 you asked that the Station conduct an updated security review of this operation, which provides photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. You asked that particular attention be paid to terminated agents and their families. The Station has made a security review and a detailed report on the findings, from Chief, WH Division, is attached.

2.  The report discusses the history of the operation, describes security problems of the past and steps taken to remedy them, and discusses the security and operational situation of the agents presently covered by the project. The report notes that the two operational sites and their associated agents are compartmented from each other and that processing the film is now being done inside the Station. One section of the report discusses in detail the assets who were formerly involved in these operations but have been terminated. The final section of the report describes current security practices and notes that an alternate photographic surveillance site has been procured and is available for use should the present one be compromised.

3.  The report demonstrates that the security of the operation is being kept up to high standards and that there are no potential security threats from former agents that the Station is not aware of. The FI Staff believes that the Station's security review and the attached report satisfy the requirements of your request.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : FI Project KDFACTOR, Security Review

REFERENCE : ADDP Memo (DD/P 1-5899) to C/WHD dated
14 December 1971

1. In response to reference the following is a summary of the KDFACTOR security review:

The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is as follows:

"There were no known problems of security relating to the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for many years and have established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the area. All five assets, four in one family and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have all been SGSWIRLED. The assets derive a substantial portion of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented from each other, and there has never been any indication that either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence".

The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security is sound. In fact, as presently constituted, the KDFACTOR Project is well compartmented, and each of the two KDFACTOR photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long-term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational activities. Terminated assets could possibly expose the existence

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters
review of terminated agents witting of present KDFACTOR
operational activities. A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
could result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts
of KDABBEY-1, the owner of an apartment building and four
houses close to the Soviet Embassy. It is doubtful that KDABBEY-l's
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the
KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the KDFACTOR
Project operational activities.

2. A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:

The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LIJERSEY
and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950's. In 1958, after
the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided
to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy.
These assets were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet
Embassy and one surveillance team from the LIJERSEY Project into a new
project (LIEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959. The LIEMPTY
Project, renamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo
basehouses, two viewing the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and
LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA),
plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED
basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.

In 1959 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team
members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the security of the project nor expose any
of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations. (Note: As the basehouse operations
were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence.)

The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964. In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse. The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept-
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security
precaution. In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

- 3 -

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the owner, KDABBEY-1. From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular photographic sur-veillance.

Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the same view. In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and LIEMPTY-6, the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP coverage of Soviet vehicular movement monitored and directed from the LIMITED basehouse. With the closing of LIMITED and the Station decision to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move it to the LIEMBRACE Project. This was done in early 1970, soon after GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December 1969.

The photo processing of the KDFACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY) film take is now being done by the Station. In the past, it was done by the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-1, who was terminated amicably in early 1971. The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by KDABBEY-1 for the Station. KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly by KDABBEY-1 but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-house for FID's KDVAULT Project. The apartment building housing the KDABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses. The LIMITED photo basehouse was also located on KDABBEY-l's property when it was active.

The individual basehouse operations are and have always been compartmented one from the other. The only points of breakdown in the compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b) KDFACTOR-1 was processing films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of their exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the KDFACTOR operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G. SCANTLING, Station contract agent retired in 1971, was aware of the KDFACTOR Project

through his past work with LIEMPTY-6 and with GERENDE on KDFACTOR Project activities; and (e) the fact that the two present basehouse properties are owned by KDABBEY-1, who is witting of the locations and general activity of both KDFACTOR basehouses..

3. Agents and Case Officers presently active in the KDFACTOR Project:

As of March 1972, Oliver J. MANKUNAS is the case officer responsible for handling the operations of KDFACTOR; Bruce H. FERNALD is the alternate case officer. The following is a list of active agents in the KDFACTOR Project:

KDFACTOR basehouses,

Regarding the security of the above active KDFACTOR agents,
the KDLITERAL basehouse is handled by KDFACTOR-2 with the assistance
of his wife, KDFACTOR-10. They have a long-time maid and a 13-year-
old son who lives with them in the basehouse. Neither the son nor the maid
is believed to be witting. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked
room, and the product is kept in a locked safe. KDFACTOR-2 was recruited
by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the
KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's
security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the
former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team
members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information
regarding LIPSTICK surveillance activities, LIPSTICK-47 was terminated
in late 1958 and is believed to have withheld from the police the information
regarding KDFACTOR-2 and the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-2
and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and
have been discreet and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors
and relatives.

The KDABSINTHE basehouse is manned by KDFACTOR-5, his
wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KDFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR-9.
The SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is witting of
KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station. The result was that his immediate
family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,
are aware of the photographic operation, KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by
LIEMPTY-12, a U. S. citizen with a private company in Mexico City who
is no longer working with the Station but who is considered patriotic and
no threat to KDFACTOR security.

4. Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present Project Security:

A. Raymond H. GERENDE

GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination on 26 June 1970. He had been employed by the Station
Intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities.
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1958 GERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and
processing films, and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent. In 1969, after years of excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,
KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used
operationally but was maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-
ceedings would be completed quickly. When it became apparent the divorce
would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE
and his wife. Bruce H. FERNALD, career agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments. GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where
he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees
of two local firms. He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class
schedule has been cut back. The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-
tion that would indicate GERENDE has violated his secrecy agreement.

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968, A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,
Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet
investigation. It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet investigation of GERENDE had proceeded, Nechiporenko
was PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971, GERENDE's possible exposure to
the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as
a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range of support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets.

B. KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)

KDFACTOR-7 is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of
GERENDE. She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children.
She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE. She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE's activities regarding the KDFACTOR
Project. She was terminated on 26 June 1970 and signed both a secrecy
agreement and quit claim. After termination it became apparent that she
had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financial problems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station
was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was
involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a
large part of which came covertly from the Station. In July 1970 KDFACTOR-7
came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-
ment. In September and November 1970 she wrote two letters directly to
the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business. In January 1971 the Agency contacied
KDFACTOR-T's brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a "Top Secret" clearance
living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-
understandings with KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station
reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social
secretary with the Department of State at the Embassy. It is believed that
this job has probably solved many of her financial problems and should also
inhibit her from exposing her past work with the Mexico City Station, as
such exposure could jeopardize her job. The Embassy in the Hague was
briefed in general terms on KDFACTOR-7's background.

C. KDFACTOR-1

KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law
of GERENDE. He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in
processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time
the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPTY Project). KDFACTOR-1

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 131

SECRET

-8-

was later assisted in processing the photographic take by his wife, LIEMPTY-5, who is GERENDE's sister, KDFACTOR-1 was terminated in March 1971, and the photographic processing previously done by KDFACTOR-1 is now done in the Station. The termination was amicable and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-l's medical practice expanded. There does not appear to be any security problem in the termination of KDFACTOR-1 as he is discreet and also a close relative of GERENDE. The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-I's medical office was good as KDFACTOR-l's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist- ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom.

D. LIEMPTY-5

LIEMPTY-5 was hired by the Station in 1957 to assist KDFACTOR-1 with the processing of KDFACTOR films. She is the sister of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-1. She was terminated along with KDFACTOR-1 in March 1971. Due to her close relationship with GERENDE and KDFACTOR-1, she is not considered a threat to the Project Security.

E. Oliver G. SCANTLING

SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 1971. SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the Station in recent years largely because his strong motivation to work against the Communists. SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team leader from 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project from 1958 through 1966. He was the cut-out to LIEMPTY-6 and a back-up principal agent for GERENDE. SCANTLING's termination was amicable, and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR Project.

F. LIEMPTY-6

LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station asset, was retired in May 1968. He had manned the LIMITED photo base- house with his wife and son assisting him. He had been working with the Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency. LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses. While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son- in-law. He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project.

There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking out the *LIMITED* photo basehouse and may have had suspicions concerning LIEMPTY-6. This was a report by KDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE-10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed interest in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the KDABSINTHE photo basehouse, but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-house keepers by name. Silnikov did name specific persons he was interested in and these included LIEMPTY-6. KDADAGE-10, of unknown reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information, but added that, between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard it rumored he worked for the Americans. In 1966 Headquarters already assumed the Soviets were aware of the *LIMITED* basehouse because it was used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case, the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the *LIMITED* basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968. It is believed this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current KDFactor assets.

5. Current KFACTOR Security Practices:

The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE remain compartmented, as they have been throughout the history of the Project. The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITERAL basehouse, and with KDFACTOR-5, responsible for the KDABSINTHE basehouse. In these meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries and handles miscellaneous administrative matters. These are car meetings usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup points are changed regularly. Meeting time is kept to a minimum and meetings are pre-scheduled whenever possible. The photographic product is processed in the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling over the past practice of having KDFACTOR-1 process it in his office darkroom. The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5; however, in emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse can be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are compromised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing the KDABSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KDCALVERT Project as residents. This new apartment offers as good a vantage point

for photographic coverage as the KDABSINTHE and could quickly be activated if for any reason the KDABSINTHE basehouse becomes untenable.

# PROJECT LIEMPTY

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL

1. CURRENT OBJECTIVES

A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year of existence, is to collect operational information on the FJSTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as related targets or opportunity through stationary/mobile photographic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollary objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY installations, mechanisms, and personnel are as follows:

1.  To provide detailed operational information pertaining to the daily movements and activities of FJSTEAL personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence interest, as well as information on the FISTEAM physical plant and visitors to the premises.

2. To collect operational information on persons associated with FIST AL personnel and on individuals known or suspected to have connections with the FJSTEAL cntelligence services or other hostile propo which are tuimical to the interests of LNFORT.

3.  To provide operational support, counter surveillance, and/or other protective servees to it FIRM personnel and operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be deemed necessary.

B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through ceat inued maintenance and exploitation いこ the LILYRIC and ICALL Case-houses, the LIENTRA mobile nit, and the services of long-time contract agent, Raymond H. G.R'NDE, The LIEPTY Presect is the cornerstone of the Station's operational progran against the JETAAL target and as such is completely responsive to Priority A-1 of the Station's (perating Directive.

C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LISצירי continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and Headquarters' requests and requirements for coverage of various targets tallung within the above cited tramework.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 145

# SECRET

During the Troject year Project LIEMPTY provided all of the tixed operational photographs and physical surveillance reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targetted against the FJSTEAL Installation and personnel. Specific examples of the LIEMPTY Froject's progress and contributions will be found in Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS).

2. CHANGES

A. Operational

1.  The major change during the proceeding period has been the closing of the LIMITED basehouse and the termination of LIEMPTY- This has resulted in considerable financial saving with no loss in efficiency--to the contrary, as a matter of fact. t. The major reason for the change was the fact that LEMPTY- was growing less reliable with age. He was not always able to be on the job, and when he was, his fixed surveillance reporting was occasionally inaccurate, and his photography was often poor. There had been considerable overlap between LII.YRIC and LIMITED reporting, and with the closing of LIMITED, the LILYRIC working hours were extended slightly so that full working hours of the FJSTEAL installation continued to be covered. The only disadvantage to this arrangement is that the vantage point of the FJSTEIL installation which had been shared by LIMITED and LILYRIC will now go uncovered during periods of annual leave by LILYRIC personnel (the LILYRIC personnel are all members of one family and normally take their leave together).

2.  There have been no changes in the operating procedures and techniques of LEEMPTY-9 in the LICALLA basehouse. The refinements described in the previous Project Cutline have been effective and have been maintained. The same can be said of LIENTRAP, which has become a much more flexible tool since its partial integration into the LIEMBRACE team. There have been no changes in I.ILYRIC procedures, other than expansion of coverage to include the entire working week.

B. Financial - LIEMPTY-9 was granted a salary increase, effective 1 May 1968, In recognition of his excellent job performance. LIEMPTY-14 and -27 were granted salary increases on 1 May 1968, largely as compensation for the extra hours they agreed to put in to insure full-time coverage of the FJSTEAL installation by LILYRIC. Memoranda of Oral Agreement covering these three salary increases were forwarded with HMMA-34573, 2 May 1968. Finally, LIENTTY-11 was granted a salary increase crective 1 January 199, in recognition of his increased work load with the LIMBRACE team. MCA was vorwarded with HMMA-33101, 23 D. cember 1968.

SECRETA


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

C. Personnel

1. As noted above, LIEMPTY-6 was terminated effective 31 May 1968 in connection with the closing of the LIMITED basehouse. Termination was completely amicable, and LIEMPTY- received a generous termination bonus.

2. LIEMPTY-26 was hired as of 1 May 1968 to help LILYRIC personnel maintain their expanded coverage. No security factor is involved, as LIFMPTY-2 is part of the same family as the rest of the LILYRIC personnel. LIEMPTY-2; had been granted an OA in 1965 and had been used sporadically since that time.

3. An amendment to GERENDE's contract has been requested. This amendment would guarantee GERENDE termination benefits equal to those provided for by Mexican law, in the event of GERINDE'Ss termination by WOFIRM. The amendment would also provide GERENDE with a graduated scale of benefits should he decade to resign, See HMMA-3312, 27 January 1909, tor details.

3. EFFECTIVENESS

Throughout the period under review, each operational component oi Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the 1ul1111ment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico City. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements 01 each component are cited below:

A. Fixed Basehouses

1. LIMITED

Until its termination, the LIMITED installation provided daily photographic coverage and physical surveillance of the main gate of the FJSTEAL installation. During the seven-month period from 1 November 1947 through 31 May 1968, the LIMITED base provided 911 frames of operational photographs. In addition, the LIMITED base provided over 1,000 pages of physical surveillance reports.

2. LILYRIC

During the Project year under review, the LILYRIC installation provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance of the front of the FUSTEAL installation. The LILYRIC base-house provided the majority of the operational photographs produced by the LIEMPTY Project. During the 13-month period from 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, the LILYRIC basehouse provided 15,331 operational photographs and several


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

thousand pages of physical surveillance reports covering the daily movements of all FJSTEAL officers. As a specific example of the importance of LILYRIC coverage, it was LILYRIC photes which made possible the identification of a WCLADY citizen who had been in clandestine contact with an AEGRIP officer. This information was turned over to LNERGO, which was pursuing the case. In general, LILYRIC provides the Station with a large percentage of the CI raw material collected on the FJSTEAL target, such as automobile license numbers, PCS and TDY arrivals and departures, unusual activities such as demonstrations, unusual or lengthy absences of personnel, etc. This information also has positive operational value, but its most important use is as the major source of identification of FJSTEAL personnel and of information on their movements, The Station has frequent requests from LNERGO which can only be fulfilled by LIEMPTY coverage, and this "permanent and complete record" of FJSTEAL activities is invaluable for servicing the CE requirements of both COFIRM and LNERGO.

3. LICALLA

During the above cited 13-month period, the LICALLA installation provided photographue and physical surveillance coverage of the back of the FASTCAL installation and its garden and patio area, This coverage provided 5,125 individual photographs as well as numberous surveillance and observation reports. These reports included daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of activities, semi-monthly attendance reports (of FJSTEAL persoanel), various special reports, and special intensive ceverage of targets selected by the Station. It should be noted that the LICALLA baseheuse allows Station Mexico City to observe the FAST AL personnel der their of-duty and recreational bours. The LICALLA installation has become the nest valuable of the basebouses, not only because of its unsere vantage peint but also because of the perceptiveness OF LIUTY-. his serveillance reports have frequently given us valsable Lostoht inte personal associations among the DUSTCAL personnel and have enabled LSs to introduce greater flexibility and Feetiveness into the entire LIMITY operation.

LICALLA reporting hos the greatest positive operational valse since it provides raw material for use in target selection. Finally, the LICALLA CF is occasionally used in support of various technical operations conducted from the LEILSA complex.

B. Suvary of Fixed Paschouse Effectiveness

The fixed LEEMOTY baschouses (LIMITED, LICALLA, and LILYRIC) provided approximately 21,367 individual rames of operational photographs during the 18-month period reviewed above. The photographic coverage, linked with the physical surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse, has proven to be a most reliable and viable tool tor:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

# SECRET

1. Following the daily comings and goings of FJSTEAL personnel and indigenous employees.

2. Confirming the identities of SESTAL staffers and their visitors (some of whom are CLAY citizens).

3. Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and position as well as indicating the specific intelligence service connection of various FJSTEIL officers.

4. Providing detailed reporting on the movement and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.

5. Providing physteal facilities for the support of various operational, technical, and serveillance operations.

## The Mobile Photographic Unit

1. During the period under review, the LIENTRAS mobile photographic unit covered 40 photographie assignments in support of Mexico City Station's FUSTEAL, PERUMEN, and Communist Party operations. An average of two to three days is spent on each assigned target, usually rotating the time of day the coverage is provided. The LIONTRAP operators, LIEMPTY-10 and -11, have consistently terned in a useful and excellent quality photographie product.

2. In addition, wiile not on an assignment, both operators have regularly assigned duties. LIEGTY-10 has the responsibility for obtaining, renewing, and servicing most of the Station's accommodation addresses. The addresses are serviced three times a week. LIEMETY-11 has been serving part-time for the past year as the seventh member of the LIEMBRACE surveillance team and has performed well in this. capacity.

## Raymond H. GERENDE - LIEMPTY Principal Avent

During the period under review, Raymond S. GRENDE continued in his role as the Project LIEMPTY principal agent. GERENDE operates as the full-time cut-out to the LIMITED, LILYRIC, and LICALLA basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling responsibility for the related personnel. In addition, GRENDE continued to bear the contact and handling responsibilities for the operator of the LIEMPTY photographic developing/processing laboratory, LIEMPTY-4. GERENDE's overall operational assignment involved at least 10 clandestine meetings per veek, in addition to his meetings with the LIENTY Project case officer. It should also be noted that GERENDE nade numerous and essential contributions to the sensitive JMRON operation and assisted the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in many instances. He is used to make independent investigations and neighborhood checks.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

assisted the Station in its MHRAVEL program. As a part of the Station's effort to breaden GERENDE'S horizons and to take better advantage of his capabilities, GRANDS was made the handling officer for ERFIN-3 under close case officer supervision. Similar tasks are envisioned for GERENDE in the future--agent handling as well as the spotting and assessment of operational leads. These tasks are all assigned with due regard for GERENDE's primary responsibilities, with the aim of getting the optimum use out of a capable and experienced field contract agent.

3. Overall Effectiveness

As outlined above, each individual operational component of the LIEVETY Project, with the exception of the phased-out LIMITED basehouse, contributed regularly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City's operational program, Sased on the continued excellent performance of Project personnel and the overall contributions of this Project, the Station strongly recommends that this project be continued during the forthcoming Project year as an essential element of the Station's operational support apparatus.

4. PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

During the Project year under review there were no known incidents which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMUTY or the related personnel. The termination of LUMPTY- caused no problems, nor did the construction of a maid's room on the root of the LICALLA installation, adjacent to LIEMPTY-9's photo point. There is no indication that FJSTEAL personnel had any suspicions about the construction work. The exposure of a LIEMBRACE surveillance vehicle (see MEXICO CITY 9283, 28 February 19.9) caused momentary concern because the vehicle had been bought from a dealer where LIEMPTY-9 has a part-time job. Along with all other employees of the auto dealer, LIEMOTY-9 was questioned about the purchaser of the car. While LIENTTY-9 was worried because he knew the purchaser of the car and was able to guess what had happened, the investigation was dropped and the case closed without any adverse effect on LIEMPTY-9 or the LICALILA basehouse.

non-LIEMPTY-oriented operational activity by GARENDE, there are no significant operational changes contemplated. LIEMPTY is a procet designed to support the Station's REDTOP program and is useful only as long as it supports that program effectively. The Station believes that the support has been eftective, and that the product of the operation is valuable. Occasional miner changes will undoubtedly be made in response to specific requirements and to continual efforts toward improvement, but continuing emphasis on the FJSTEAL target for the foreseeable future means, among other things, that the LIENTTY Project, in essentially its present fora, will continue to be a necessary part of the Station's program.

C. As in the past, Raymond H. GERENDE will submit semi-monthly accountings for all Project expenditures with appropriate receipts or certifications. There will be no requirements for foreign currency beyond the Station's capability to provide.

8. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is believed that regular operational contact could be maintained with the majority of the active LIEMPTY agents via Raymond IH. GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.

B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime openly hostile to LNOST, limited contact could probably be maintained with the majority on the active Project agents. However, under these circumstances, it is highly probable that the activities of this Project would be somewhat curtailed.

C. Revised and up-dated emergency contact plans for use with Raymond IH. GEREND: and Oliver G. SCANTLING are on file in the Station and at Headquarters (see HMA-26333, dated 21 February 1965 and HAMMA-28252, dated 9 February 1966).

# SECRE!

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1. Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for the period 1 December 1967 through 30 November 1968 in the amount of $43,520 is hereby requested. $26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and $17,315 in FỶ 1969. The project was budgeted for $45,000 for FY 1968; funds are available within the Division. Estimated costs for the coming project year are a little less than the amount programmed for the previous year and a little more than what was actually disbursed.

2. LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It covers three nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance are carried out by experienced personnel. The project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes the photographs. In addition to collecting this basic information on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such as servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving surveillances. The photo truck which comes under the project is used on other targets as well, such as CP members, satellite embassies, and Latin American exiles. One of the basehouses is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team, but this function has been minimized during the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of the signal.

3. a. The Mexican desk asked the appropriate operational component of SB Division for specific comment on the value of LIEMPTY, and received the following:

> "This rather unique operation has unquestionably made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet Operations program of the Mexico Station. On the positive side its principal value lies in the identification of the Mexican and

third national contacts of the Soviets, from which we must select and develop the access agents so vital to our operations against the Soviet human target. LIEMPTY also provides us with a much clearer picture of the inner relationships and activity patterns within the Soviet mission itself, which in turn facilitates effective targeting. The CE value of a LIEMPTY type project as a monitor of real and potential agent contacts is of course obvious. It is important to note that LIEMPTY is not, as might be the case in stations of lesser overall capability, a simple case of photography (or observation) for the record. Rather it is an important facet of a concerted high priority effort to get at and recruit individual Soviets,"

b. Station reporting has been in a similar vein. Information produced is largely for operational purposes and we often lack detail as to specific utility in a given situation, although we can produce statistics on numbers of photographs produced and numbers of pages of surveillance notes. It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they have received from LIEMPTY a great many reports on American callers at the Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double agent operations.

c. During a conversation on 8 December 1967, the officer who heads the station's SB section told the branch that LIEMPTY is basic and essential to all of his branch's operational planning, that he "grabs the LIEMPTY material first thing in the morning" and studies it for leads, evidence of which Soviet officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away, who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out of the building with whom, etc. etc. New additions to the Embassy staff can be tabbed as KGB or GRU by their associates, their activity patterns and the cars they drive. (The I.S. men are often away from the Embassy, while the legitimate FSO's tend to spend more time in their offices. The KGB, GRU and regular diplomatic groups seldom cross lines but stay within their own tight groups.) When

double agents are turned over from one case officer to a new one, known to them only in alias, we are often able, through surveillance and photographs, to establish the true identity of the new case officer, as was done in the case of AEGIMMICK in the spring of 1967.

4. In assessing the security of the operation, the station assumes that the Soviets realize that they are being watched, as was evidenced by a Soviet officer's trying to shield an FBI-directed walk-in from observation. There have been rumors that anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photographed, but no allegations that the Americans are doing it have come to our attention; the probable assumption is that the Mexicans are doing this. A former source who lives in the neighborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew about LIEMPTY/6, one of the safehousekeepers, and the Soviets have said they think he is watching them. On the security of the LICALLA safehouse there is a difference of opinion. GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks the Soviets are aware that they are being observed from this post, but station disagrees and produces good justification for its views, citing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks. We have no evidence that Soviet interest is any threat to the operation; rather it may be assumed that they accept the surveillance as a fact of life.

# PROJECT LIEMPTY

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL

1. CURRENT OBJECTIVES

A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its tenth year of existence, is to collect operational information on the FJSTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as related targets of opportunity through stationary/mobile photographic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollary objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY installations, mechanisms and personnel are as follow:

1.  To provide detailed operational information pertaining to the daily movements and activities of the FJSTEAL personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence interest, as well as information on the FJSTEAL physical plant and visitors to the premises.

2.  To collect operational information on persons associated with FJSTEAL personnel and on individuals known or suspected to have connections with the FJSTEAL intelligence services or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests of LNFORT.

3.  To provide operational support, counter surveillance and/or other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be deemed necessary.

B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through continued maintenance and exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-time contract agent, Raymond H. GERENDE. These objectives are in consonance with operational directives and Headquarters requirements as received by Station Mexico City.

C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and Headquarters' requests and requirements for coverage of various targets falling within the above cited framework. During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly all of the operational photographs and physical surveillance reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targeted against the FJSTEAL installation and personnel. Specific examples of the LIEMPTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 165

2. CHANGES

A. Operational - Since the institution of the changes described in the previous renewal request, it has not been found necessary or desirable to make further major changes. The following minor changes in operational technique have been made in an effort to obtain continued improvement in the finished product:

1.  LIEMPTY-9's proven effectiveness as an observer (see paragraph 3 A (3) below) has enabled us to institute a system of special coverage on specific FJSTEAL personnel of interest, or special coverage of specific time periods of interest. The purpose is to permit the Station to gain greater insights into.the activities and personal associations of certain individuals, or in overall activities during a certain time period. No change in LIEMPTY-9's overall working hours has been made; rather, flexibility has been introduced.

2.  Flexibility has also been introduced into the handling of LIENTRAP, which is now working more closely with the LIEMBRACE team in order to take greater advantage of targets of opportunity. To this end, LIEMBRACE-1 has been placed in direct contact with LIENTRAP, relieving Raymond H. GERENDE of this responsibility and permitting GERENDE to devote time to MHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).

3.  In September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by the Mexican MHRAVEL committee. This position gave him direct access to FJSTEAL and other delegations of interest, and supplemented the Station's MHRAVEL program. It is expected that GERENDE will obtain MHRAVEL employment again in 1968.

B. Financial - LIEMPTY-4 and -11 were granted salary increases effective 1 July 1967. Memoranda of Oral Commitment were forwarded to Headquarters in HMMA-32584 and HMMA-32585, 20 July 1967. There was no change in the salaries of the remaining LIEMPTY agents.

C. Personnel - None.

3. EFFECTIVENESS

Throughout the period under review, each operational component of Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico City. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements of each component are cited below:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 166

A. Fixed Basehouses

## 1. LIMITED

Throughout the past project year the LIMITED installations provided daily photographic coverage and physical surveillance of the main gate of the FJSTEAL installation. In addition, the LIMITED base provided for a fixed radio dispatching station which was used to support the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. Due to the stringent security measures instituted in the immediate vicinity of the FJSTEAL installation by local security forces, normal stake-outs by this unilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio dispatching support from the LIMITED radio base, which allows the LIEMBRACE team to work from adjacent safe areas, secure surveillance coverage of this target can be provided. During the 12-month period from 1 November 1966 through 31 October 1967, the LIMITED base provided 1,834 frames of operational photographs. m addition, the LIMITED base provided over 2,500 pages of physical surveillance reports.

## 2. LILYRIC

During the project year under review, the LILYRIC installation provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance of the front of the FJSTEAL installation. The LILYRIC base provided the majority of the operational photographs produced by the LIEMPTY project. During the 12-month period cited in the LIMITED section above, the LILYRIC base provided 12,137 operational photographs and several thousand pages of physical surveillance reports covering the daily movements of all FJSTEAL officers.

## 3. LICALLA

During the above cited 12-month period, the LICALLA installation provided photograph:c and physical surveillance coverage of the back of the FJSTEAL installation and its garden and patio area. This coverage provided 4,917 individual photographs as well. as numerous surveillance and observation reports. It should be noted that the LICALLA base allows Station Mexico City to observe the FJSTEAL personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours. The LICALLA installation has become the most valuable of the three, not only because of its unique vantage point but also because of the perceptiveness of LIEMPTY-9. His surveillance reports have frequently given us valuable insight into personal associations among the FJSTEAL personnel and have enabled us to introduce greater flexibility and effectiveness into the entire LIEMPTY operation.

B. Summary of Fixed Basehouse Effectiveness

The fixed LIEMPTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC) provided approximately 18,888 individual frames of operational photographs during the 12-month period of the past project year. This photographic coverage, linked with the physical surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse, has proven to be a most reliable and viable tool for:

1.  Following the daily comings and goings of FJSTEAL personnel and indigenous employees.

2.  Confirming the identities of FJSTEAL staffers and their visitors (some of whom are WOLADY citizens).

3.  Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and position as well as indicating the specific intelligence service connection of various FJSTEAL officers.

4.  Providing detailed reporting on the movement and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.

5.  Providing physical facilities for the support of various operational, technical and surveillance operations.

C. The Mobile Photographic Unit

Throughout the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile photographic support unit was regularly exploited and used by Station Mexico City, not only on the FJSTEAL target, but also for PBRUMEN and Communist Party operations as well as the JMTIGER program. Over 2,000 operational photographs were provided. In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit was used regularly to service and obtain various postal accomodation boxes used by Mexico City, Headquarters and other field stations.

D. Raymond H. GERENDE - LIEMPTY Principal Agent

During the period under review, with the exception of short vacation periods, Raymond H. GERENDE, continued in his role as the Project LIEMPTY principal agent. GERENDE operated as the full-time cut-out to the LIEMPTY, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling responsibility for the related personnel. In addition, GERENDE


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

- 5-

continued to bear the contact and handling responsibilities of the LIENTRAP unit (until mid-August 1967 - see paragraph 2 A(2) above) and for the operator of the LIEMPTY photo- graphic developing/processing laboratory, LIEMPTY-4.
GERENDE's overall operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY Froject case officer. It should also be noted that GERENDE made numerous and essential contributions to the sensitive AMROD operation and assisted the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in many instances. He is frequently used to make independent investigations and neighborhood checks. As noted above, he contributed significantly to the Station's MHRAVEL program. Finally, he apprcached, developed and eventually attempted to recruit an agent for use in PBRUMEN operations.

E. Overall Effectiveness

As outlined above, each individual operational component of the LIEMPTY Project contributed regularly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City's operational program. Based on the continued excellent performance and overall contributions of this project, the Station strongly recommends that this project be continued during the forth- coming project year as an essential element of the Station's operational support apparatus.

4. PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

During the project year under review there were no known inci- dents which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY or the related personnel.

5. LIAISON AND INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION

Not applicable to Project LIEMPTY.

6. PLANS

A. As noted above, the technical and operational changes made in the past year have been effective and have resulted in a product which is as closely geared to operational requirements as possible. While no major changes are contemplated, every effort will be made to continue to improve the product, including greater use of GERENDE as an independent investigative asset, and as a spotter and assessor of selected agent candidates. Such utilization of GERENDE will be kept compartmented from other personnel of the LIEMPTY project and will normally be handled by GERENDE in operational alias.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

B. The LIENTRAP vehicle has been replaced, and no major
changes in personnel or material are contemplated. Salaries
of LIEMPTY personnel will be reviewed, and it is foreseen that
the rising cost of living will compel us to recommend salary
increases for certain of the agents who have not received
raises in some time.

7. COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Project LIEMPTY was previously approved
for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the
amount of 45,000 U.S. currency. Station records indicate that
through 31 October 1967, Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 in
the field. It is estimated that a total of 40,130 will be expended
in the entire project year. Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent
receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H. GERENDE
to the Station finance officer via the project case officer for all
LIEMPTY Project expenditures made in the field. It is estimated
that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst
time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative
and analytical requirements of this project. (This figure does not
include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H. GERENDE).

B. During Project Year - It is requested that Project LIEMPTY be
approved in the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period 1
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents a
slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project
year). While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replace-
ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an
increase in the rental of the various basehouses may be encountered
as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases. Of the
amount requested above, 26,205 dollars should be allowed for fiscal
year 1968 and 17,315 dollars for fiscal year 1969. A detailed break-
down of the project expenditure by category and by fiscal year follows:

C. As in the past, Raymond H. GERENDE will submit bi-weekly
accountings for all project expenditures with appropriate
receipts or certifications. There will be no requirements for
foreign currency beyond the Station's capability to provide.

8. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is
now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained
with the majority of the active LIEMPTY agents via Raymond H.
GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.

B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be
maintained with the majority of the active project agents.
However, under the circumstances described above, it is highly
probable that the activities of this project would be somewhat
curtailed.

COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (To go forward to the Division)

The CI Staff concurs in the renewal of this very valuable Project. The Staff strongly urges the Station to continue its close monitoring of Soviet interest in the installation buildings and attempts to obtain information on sensitive project personalities. The Station should devise necessary contingency plans of action to eliminate any security hazards if it is determined that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be getting "too close"to the Project installations, personalities and activities.

## PROJECT LIEMPTY

1. CURRENT OBJECTIVES

A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its ninth year of ex- istence, is to collect operational information on the LEDERICK installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as related targets of opportunity through stationery/mobile photographic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollary objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY installations, mechanisms and personnel are as follow:

1.  To provide detailed operational information pertaining to the daily movements and activities of the LIMERICK personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence interest, as well as information on the LIDERICK physical plant and visitors to the premises.

2.  To collect operational information on persons associated with LIMERICK personnel and on individuals known or suspected to have connections with the LEDERICK intelligence services or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests of LAFER.

3.  To provide operational support, counter surveillance and/or other protective services to WOFACT personnel and operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be deemed necessary.

B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through continued maintenance and exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses, the LIMTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-time contract agent, Raymond H. GARENDS. These objectives are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the following sections of the current Related Mission Directive (RMD) as approved for Station Mexico City:

PRIORITY A
Section 1, subsection f
Section 2, subsections b & e

PRIORITY B
Section 1, subsection a
Section 2, subsection a

C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and Headquarters' requests and requirements for coverage of various targets falling within the framework of the above cited sections of the RMD. During the last 10 months Project LIN PTY provided the vast majority of the operational photographs (approximately 16,000) and physical surveillance reports (4,000) used in Mexico City Station's operations targetted against


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 177

the LIMERICK installation and personnel. Specific exnaples of the LIEMPTY
Project's progress and contributions to the RND will be found in Section 3
below (EFFECTIVENESS).

## CHANGES.

A. Operational - As noted in the previous Request for Project Renewal,
the foraer LEITED property was sold to LINCUSDE, who as per formal agree-
went with the Station, demolished the old structure and constructed a new
edifice. While it was initially contemplated to place the LIMITED
(LIEMPTYS -6 and -7) personnel in the new building and to retain the sane,
equal division of workload between LILYRIC and LIMITED, 16 was later
accrued to move the present LILYRIC basehouse personnel (LIFMPTYS-13, -14,
-26 and -27) into the new base instead, along with the following ancillary
modifications:

An increase in the hours of both the photographic and physical surveillence
coverage provided from the new base by the LILYRIC operators (0000-1500
hours) during the weekdays and to have the LIMITED base provide
photographic and physical surveillance coverage froa 1600-1630 hours
on weekdays and from 0900-1300 hours on weekends. These changes were
dictated by the following considerations:

1.  The new LIMOUSINE building offers a much better vantage point
    for both photographic and physical surveillance than does the
    present complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases.
    Therefore, the Station felt that the personnel occupying this
    new base should be those possessing the highest technical skills
    and also those able to provide the cost thorough and complete
    coverage. Since the LIMITED base now has only one trained
    operator while the LILYRIC basehouse hes three, the LILYRIC group
    and a revision of working hours was indicatel.

2.  Because it was apparent that the coverage of the LIMERICK
    Installation would be a long-range and continuing requiresent,
    the Station desired to staff the new base with personnel of long-
    range potential. LIEMPTY-6, now almost 60 years old, does not
    possess this potential; however, the LILYRIC agent complex
    happily combines experienced personnel with youthful agents.

3.  Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC
    personnel is much more compatible and consistent with the en-
    vironsent of the new building than is that of the LIMITED family.

The above-citel revised work schedule was initiated in July 1966 and
the actual sovement of the LILYRICs into the new base beger in late
September 1966.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 178

B. Financiel - After a detailed review of the then-existing LINGTY agent salary structure, selestei agents (LISKPTYS -6, -9, -16, and -11) were granted salary increases effective 1 January 1966. Formal notification and revisel sexoranla oral cosaitaent were forwarded to Headquarters with ANNA-26,136, stel 25 January 1966. There was no change in the salaries of the remaining Y agents.

C. Personnel

1.  During the Project year under review, LIANPTY-6, -9, -13, -14, -26 and -27 were afforded their initial SWIRL exasinctions, all with satisfactory results.

2.  LIEMPTY-26 was granted an A effective 29 November 1965 for use as a cut-out to the Lim beschouse (MAN-14177, dated 9 December 1965) LIETTY-25 has been assively used during the past Project year for the above-stated purpose..

3.  LIEMPTY-27 was greated an OA on 27 July 1966 for use as a part-tise LIDLYRIC basehouse operator (2001-14757, dated 1 August 1966). While LIEMPTY-27's heavy waiversity schedule has thus far precluded his regular use by the Station, is is anticipated that subject will be regularly employeed after the eal of the present school term.

3. EFFECTIVENESS.

Throughout the period under review, each operational component of Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the operational tasks lerisi on Station Mexico City by the IUD and other directives. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements of each component are cited below:

A. Fixed Basehouses

1. LIMITED

Throughout the past Froject year (with the change in working hours noted in paragraph above), the LIMITED installation provided daily photographic corengs and physical surveillance of the main gate of the LEERICK installation. In addition, the LAITED bese provided for a fixed ratis Sispatching station which was used continually to support the LDOFACE surveillance tees. Due to the stringent security measures instituted in the immediate vicinity of the LIMERICK installation by el security forces, normel stake-outs by this unilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio dispatching support from the DD radio base, which allows the LIMBRACE team to work from adjacent safe areas, secure surveillance coverage of this


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 179

target can de provided. During the 9-month period from 1 Novender
1965 throw 30 July 1966, the LIMITED base provided 3,775 frames
of operational photographs. In addition, the LIMITED bese providel
over 1,000 pages of physical surveillance reports.

## 2. LILYRIC

During the Project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance of the
front of the LECRICK installation. The LILYRIC base not only pro-
vided the jority of the operational photographs produced by the LEMPTY
project, but also provided the most detailal physical surveillance
reports. During the 9-month period cited in the LIMITED section above,
the LILYRIC dese provided over 6,500 operational photographs and 3,000
pages of physical surveillance reports covering the daily movements of
all LIMERICK officers.

## 3. LICALLA

During the above cited 9-month period, the LICALLA installation provided
photographic and physical surveillance coverage of the back of the
LIMERICK installation and its garden and petio area. This coverage
provided over 3,600 individual photographs as well as numerous sur
veillance and observation reports. It should be noted that the
LICALLA base allows Station Mexico City to observe the LIMERICK
personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours.

## B. Suszary of Fixed Paschouse ffectiveness

The fixed LIFETY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC) provided
approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational photographs
during the first 9-month period of the pest project year. Within the
last year, this photographic coverage linkel with the physical
surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse, has proven to be a
most reliable aad viable toch for:

1. Following the daily comings and seings of LIMERICK personnel
   and irisenous caployees.

2. Confiraing the identities of LIARICK staffers and their
   visitors (sone of whom are WOLADY citizens).

3. Acertaining and verifying the relative rank and position
   as well as indicating the specific intelligence service connection
   of varicus LDERICK officers.

4. Proriding detailed reporting on the movesent ani habit patterns
   of selectei targets of special interest.

5. Proting physical facilities for the support of various op-
   erationel, technical and surveillance sperations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 180

## C. The Nobile Photographic Unit.

1.  Throughout the period under review, the LILLITRAP Mobile photographic/ support unit was regularly exploited and used by Station Nexico City. This unit provided over 1,000 individual photographs and was used in support of Station operations and activities. Of particular value to Station Nexico City and the MITIGER prograa were numerous photographe of local and exile Coavunist leaders provided by LLETRAP. In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit was used regularly to service and obtain various postal acconsolation boxes used by Mexico City, Head- quarters and other field statione.

## D. Rayaond H. GERONDE - LIMTTY Principal Agent.

During the period under review, with the exception of short vacation periods, Reymond N. GERANDE, continued in his role as the Project LIMPIY principal agent. GERENDE operated as the full-time cut-out to the LIEMPTY, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling responsibility for the related personnel. In addition, GERENDE continued to bear the contact and handling res- ponsibilities of the LIEMTRAP wait and for the operator of the LIEMPTY photographic developing/processing laboratory, LIEMITY-4. GRENDE'S overall operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIMITY Project case officer. It should also be noted that GRUNDE sade numerous and essen- tial contributions to the sensitive MROD operation and assisted the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in many instances.

## E. Overall Effectiveness

As outlined above, each individual operational component of the LIEMPTY Project contributed regularly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City's operational progres. Based on the continued excellent performance and overall contributions of this project, the Station strongly recommends that this project be continued during the forthcoming project year as an essential element of the Station's operational support apparatus.

## 4. PROKLIENS AND SECURITY.

During the Project year under review there were no known incidents which adversely affected the security of Project LIMPTY or the related personnel. The only significant problem encountered in the operation and administration of this project stemned from the physical move of the LILYRIC personnel to the new base in the LIMOUSINE building. Miserous delays arising from the faulty performance of the local contractors and construction crews hampered a timely relocation of this base. However, it is anticipated that the new LILYRIC base will be in full operation by the end of October 1966.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 181

## 5. LIAISON AND INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION.

Not applicable to Project LEEMPTY.

## 6. PLANS.

A. As outlined in paragraph 6 of the Station's previous request for the renewal of Project LENPIT, a program was undertaken to reequip and modernize the LIEMPTY photographic processing base. During the past year, a significant portion of the equipment used in the developing and processing laboratory was replaced. As a result of this program, negatives and photographic prints of such higher quality are now being produced. Consequently, only minor changes in the operation of the photographic laboratory and its equipment are contemplated for the ensuing period.

B. The present physical condition, mileage and frequent use of the LIMITILAP unit dictates the immediate replacement of this unit. Station Mexico City has received Headquarters approval for the replacement of this vehicle.

C. Other than noted above, Mexico City plans no significant operational, administrative or personnel changes, since it is generally felt that this Project is now operating at its optimum size and in a highly satisfactory manner. After 1 January 1967, the Station will review the existing LIEMPTY personnel salary schedule and consider possible raises, again on a selective basis or specifically keyed to the rising cost of living

## 7. COSTS.

A. Past Project Year - Project LIEMPTY was previously approved for the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966 for the amount of 41,500 U.S. currency. Station records indicate that thus far, Project LUNITY has expended 30,508,13 in the field. It is estimated that approximately 1,500 dollars has been expended by Headquarters, principally in the acquisition of new equipment for the LIETTY photographic laboratory. Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond E. DE to the Station Finance officer via the Project case officer for all LIR PIY Project expenditures made in the field. It is estimated that approximately 12 hours of case officer and 5 hours of analyst time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative and analytical requirements of this Project. (This figure does not include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H. GERAIDS).

B. Ensuing Project Year - It is requested that Project LIEPTY be approved in the amount of 45,000 U.S. currency for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 (this figure represents only a slight increase over the amount progressed for the previous Project year). While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replacement of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an increase in the rental of the various base-houses will be encountered as well as the above-cited replacement of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 182

C. As in the past, Raymond A. will subalt bi-weekly accountings for all Project expenditures with appropriate receipts or certifications. There will be no requiresents for foreign currency beyond the Station's capability to provide.

2. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.

A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete or enforced neutrality on the pert of the host government, it is now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained with the majority of the active LIMPTY agents via Raymond R. GERENDS or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.

B. In the most unlikely event of the establishaent of a regiae openly hostile to LaFeltr, liaited contact could probably be maintained with the sajority of the ective Project agents. However, under the circuastances described above, it is highly probable that the activities of this Project would be somewhat curtailed.

C. Revised and up-datel emergency contact plans for use with Raymond H. CERENDE and Oliver G. SCANTLING are on file in the Station and at Headquarters (see HAMA-26355, datal 21 February 1966 and MMMA-20252, dated 9 February 1966)

# SECRET OPER

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL

PROJECT LIEPTY

1. CURRENT OBJECTIVES

A) The overall objective of Project LIMPTY, now in its eighth year of existence, is to collect operational information on the LECRICK installation and personnel, as well as related targets of opportunity, through stationary and mobile photographic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollary objectives which are to be fulfilled through the use of the LIEPTY installations and personnel are as follow:

1) To provide operational information pertaining to the daily activities and movements of the LEERICK personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence interest, as well as information on the LIMERICK physical facilities and visitors to the premises.

2) To collect operational information on persons associated with LIMERICK and on individuals known or suspected to have connections with opposition intelligence services or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests of OURCE.

3) To provide operational support, countersurveillance, and other protective services to Station personnel and operations as may be deemed necessary.

B) The above objectives are to be fulfilled through the continued exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and DICALJA basehouses, the LIMTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-time contract agent, Raymond W. GRADE. These objectives are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the following sections of the current Related Mission Directive (RMD) as approved for Mexico City Station:

PRIORITY A

Section 2, subsection b.

PRIORITY B

Section 1, subsection a.

Section 2, subsection a.

C) Throughout the project year under review, Project LISTY continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfillment of the Station's and Headquarters' requests and requirements for coverage of various targets falling within the framework of the above cited objectives of the RMD. Specific examples of the LIMATY Project's progress and contributions to the RMD will be found in Section 3.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 188

2. CHANGES

A) Administrative - As noted in the regularly submitted LIMITY progress reports and the previous Request for Renewal of Project LIMITY (Section VI, subsection L), during the past two years it had become obvious that many of the operational assignments levied on Oliver S. SCUMBLER (covered by Project LIMITY during six months of the past project year), while completely within the realm of the RD, were falling outside the proper scope of Project LIMITY; consequently, a new project was prepared by the Station and approved by Headquarters to cover JR's relationship with and the support of SCUTTLING. SCUTTLING was therefore removed from the nests of Project LIMITY on 1 May 1965 and integrated into the new close support Project LIMICOR.

B) Operational - As noted in the previous Request for Project Renewal, all operational activity was suspended in late September 1964 at the LIMITED base-house because of the potential security ramifications stemming from the overt publication of a LIMITED photograph in the Warren Commission Report. The Station subsequently acquired an apartment in the immediate vicinity of the LIMERICK installation and moved the LIMITED basehouse keepers into this temporary location. After a prudent cooling-off period, all LIMITED operational activities (photographic, physical surveillance, and radio dispatching) were re-initiated from the new location in early January 1965. During the interim period, and as a result of separate correspondence with Headquarters, the former LIMITED property was sold to LEMOUSINE, who as per formal agreement with the Station, demolished the old structure and began construction of a new edifice. Included in this formal agreement with LEMOUSINE is the proviso that one floor of the new building will be reserved for the sole use of Station Mexico City. Upon completion of the new structure, the LIMITED personnel and operational activity will be securely transferred from the temporary apartment to the new, more ideally located LEMOUSINE building.

C) Finance - After a detailed review of the then-existing LIMITY agent salary structure, selected agents (LIMITY-9, LIMITY-11, and LIMITY-14) were granted salary increases effective 1 February 1965. (Formal notification and the pertinent revised Memorandum of Oral Commitment were forwarded to Headquarters with IRMA-260232, dated 1 June 1965). In addition, as per the Headquarters prepared contract amendment, Raymond H. G. SWEM was granted a salary increase effective 1 July 1965. There was no change in the salaries of the eight remaining active LIMITY agents.

D) Personnel - LIMITY-26 was granted a POA on 13 October 1965 for use as a cut-out to the SILMIC basehouse. FRO II information is being compiled and will be submitted in the near future. LIMITY-26 was actively used after receipt of the POA.

3. EFFECTIVENESS

Throughout the period under review, each operational component of Project LIMITY contributed actively to the fulfillment of the overall operational program levied on the Station by the RD and other Headquarters requests. Highlights of the accomplishments and achievements of each component follow:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 189

SECRET

-3-

A) LIMITED - Throughout the past project your, with the exception noted in paragraph 2, section F. above, the LEiffel installation provided daily photo coverage and physical surveillance of the main sacs of the LEERICK Instal- lation during the afternoon and early overings. (wiring the morning hours, the LETTED Pasehouse keepers prepare the pewritten surveillance reports and photographic logs covering the previos dia's activities). In addition, the LEIFTED installation providel are rallo dispatch base, used regularly to support the LIMEPACE surveillance team. Pecause of the tight security measures instituted by the local security forces in the immediate vicinity of the LEERICK installation, normal stakeouts by this unilateral team are precluded. However, with the sport of the LIMITED radio base, which can dispatch the tean from aj'ssens safo-areas, secure and effective aurveillance coverage of this target can bo provided. During the ten-month perted from 1 November 1964 thrust 1967, the LIMITED base provided 150 100.18 of 35mm operatical still photographs, which provided the Station with approximately 2,970 el frames. In addition, the LIMITED base provided bi-weekly presies surveillance suamary reports.

B) LILYRIC - The LILYRIC installation also provided emersive photo raphic and fixed visual surveillance of the front of the installation through- out the periol under review, during the comins sa serly afternoon hours, with eveningo being spent in the preparation of written surveillance reports and photographic legs. Aring the ter-month perisi ra 1 ilovember 1964 through 30 August 1965, the LILIRIC hegelhouse pred 5,060 val frames (226 rolls) of 35 operational photo spis. In addition, the LILIRIC basehouse kooper provide: 1,060 pages of physical sumeillance reports covering the inily movements of the principal officers.

C) LICALLA - During the above-noted ten-month perist, the DICALLA installation provided photographic and physical surveillance ererage of the back of the LEORICK 1:stallatior, the carlon and the palis area. This coverage produced 155 rolla of 35mm film, which produced individual photographs as well as bi-weekly physical surveillance smaries. In addition, various Headquarters specialists made right-time entries into the LICALL. hasehouse for on-site clandestine surveys in support of a vizitial sensitive technical operation.

iii) verifying the relative rank ani position as well as the specific intelligence service connection of various LIMERICK officers;

iv) provided detailed reporting on the movement patterns of selected targets of special interest; and

v) providing physical facilities for the support on various technical and surve:lla.co team operations.

B) LIMERIC - Throughout the period unier review, the LIMERICK mobile unit was heavily usei and exploitely station Mexico city. This anit provided 1,797 Individual photographs of various tercets of operational interest to Mexico City Station, partie Larl local. Communist leaders and stallstions as well as varies commiot exiles now residin, ta Mexico City. In calition, the LIMERICK personnel regularly servicol approximately twenty pestel accomo-dation boxas used operationally by Mexico City, Headquarters, and other staliens,

Specifically, the LIMAP unit:

1) provided and serviced accommodation Foxes for the sensitive ACICD operation;

11) provided photo raphie, casing coverage of an embassy er interest to KUTUC/D for use in operational planning;

iii) provided up-to-late photos of invisals and an installation linked with the Spanish Repablicon (lovelists) group to Nexies; and

tv) providel identifientions, locations, and contacts various local and exile communists in support of recruitment/penetration progrems directei against the Partido Comunista Mexicane, the Partido Popalar Socialiste, and various exile communist leaders.

3) OLIVER G. SCANTLING - during the six-month period in which he was covered by the LISTTY Project (sea paragraph 2, section s.) Oliver G. SCANTLING contributed heavily to the Aulillent of the ND. Specifically, SCANTLING: Servei as the altermate Station contact to LICAJA-1, the singleton agent in a sensitive cad productive LAULICLE operation; prepered mmerous detailed casing reports three of wisich were in support of KUTURE'D operational programs; conducted several pretext investigations; success, recruited and hanilei an agent with access to the TERUMEN Eassy, which resulted in two technical penetrations (LIMOICE) of that hostile installation; male essential contriations to the ANOD cperation in the form of translations and physical leg-work; and handled varicas LIMOTY Regents during the absence of the regular LDMETY Principal Kent, Rajmond H. GERUNDE.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 191

F) [Illegible Name] - During the period under review, with the exception of short vacation periods, CELID continued in his role as the LIMOTY Principal Agent. This assignment entailed regular meetings with the LILMIC, LILOM, and LILRD base/case keepers (or cutouts to these bases); regular contact with the operators of the LIMTIP mobile photo unit; regular contact with the LILMT: photographic developing and processing base; and numerous operational tasks in support of the [Illegible Name] operation. Specifically, this effort involved at least twelve clandestine agent or Case Officer meetings per week, the first echelon financial accountability for the expenditure of $35,000 per annum, in addition to various cover-job duties.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

As outlined above, each individual operational component of the LIITTY project contributed significantly and regularly to the fulfillment of the over- all operational program levied on the Station by the RED and other directives. Based on the time performance and overall contributions of this project, the Station concludes that this operation is essential to the fulfillment of the 185 and should be continued during the forthcoming year.

4. PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

The only significant operation/security problems which confronted the LIGETY project during the period under review, were those which stemmed directly or indirectly from the overt release of the clandestine LIMITED photographs published in the Warren Commission Report. The precise damage occasioned locally by the public disclosure of this clandestinely acquired information still cannot be measured. However, time-consuming personnel moves, with the attendant loss of coverage and additional cost as well as otherwise necessary expenditures of Station time and effort were required by this incident. (See paragraph IV of the 1964 LIEPTY Project Renewal Request for details). Other than the above affair, there have been no operational, administrative, or personnel problems which the Station could not readily and securely resolve.

5. LIAISON AND INTERAGENCY COORDINATION

Not applicable to Project LIELTY

6. PLANS

A) As further implementation of a program initiated during the latter portion of the past project year, Mexico City Station will continue to give increased emphasis to improving the quality of the photographic product from the LISTTY basehouses. While no concomitant reduction in the quantity of photo- graphs is anticipated, the Project Case Officer, with the assistance of the local KURICT representative will continue to emphasis the quality rather than the number of photographs. An ancillary objective of this program is to replace a significant portion of the equipment now used in the LLCTY developing and processing lab. Much of this equipment is over eight years old


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 192

and no longer leads itself to the production of high-quality negatives or photographic prints. The total cost of this equipment replacement program is not expected to exceed $500 and sufficient funds have been included in the cost section of this renewal request.

B) Other than noted above, Mexico City Station plans no other significant operational, administrative or personnel changes, since it is generally felt that this project is now operating at its optimum size and in a completely satisfactory manner. After 1 January 1966 the Station will review the existing LIMITY salary schedule and consider possible raises, again on a selective basis.

7. COSTS

A) Past Project Year - Station records indicated that Project LEETTY expended $30,549.99 during the ten-month period from 1 December 1964 through 30 September 1965. Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent receipts and/or certifications were submitted by GUIDE and SOATLING to the Station finance officer via the project Case Officer for all LEETTY Project expenditures. It is estimated that approximately fifteen hours of Case Officer and five hours of analyst time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative and analytical requirements of this project.

B) Issuing Project Year - It is requested that Project LIMITY be approved in the amount of $41,500 for the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966. (The project was previously programmed for $50,000;

Of this amount, $25,520 should be allotted for FY 1966 and $15,980 for FY 1967. A detailed breakdown of project expenditures by category and by fiscal year follows:

C) As in the past, Raymond H. GERENDE will submit bi-weekly accountings for all project expenditures with appropriate receipts and certifications. There are no requirements for foreign currency beyond the Station's capability to provide.

8. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

A) In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete or enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained with the active LINTTY agents via Raymond H. GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANLING.

B) In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime hostile to ODYOKS, limited contact could probably be maintained with the active project agents through GERENDE or SCANLING. However, under the conditions described above, it is doubtful whether this project would be able to operate against more than one-or two selected targets.

C) Emergency communications plans for Oliver G. SCANLING and Raymond H. GERENDE are on file in the Station and at Headquarters (see KWM-15982 and IDMA-15981, of 25 November 1958). In addition, in late 1964, a review was held with all active agents of their recontact plans and verbal recognition signals.

DD/P2-0214

1. The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1961 through 30 November 1962. This project provides for physical and photographic surveillance operations in support of Mexico City Station operations, particularly those directed against Soviet personnel and installations.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $44,500 from the DD/P-WH Division budget: $24,500 in fiscal year 1962, and $20,000 in fiscal year 1963 subject to the availability of funds. This estimate includes $139,500 for salaries of three contract agents and eleven indigenous agents; $20,500 for operational expenses, including QP vehicle operation and maintenance, new safehouse procurement, post office boxes, purchase of information, and rental of vehicles; $1,300 for repair, maintenance, and replacement of photographic equipment; and $2,500 for maintenance of three safehouses.

3. The attached request for renewal discusses project activities in the past period. Contract Agent Oliver G. SCANTLING (p), serving as an investigator, has continued to follow up on leads developed from other operations; has been the primary source of information on residences of Soviet Embassy personnel; has provided investigative information on several cases of CI interest; and has trained surveillance assets in Monterrey. He also handled the LIMBO surveillance team during the time Contract Agent Simon V. SLADICH (p) was absent from Mexico. The project segment under the direction of Contract Agent Raymond H. GIBBLE (p) continued to collect operational information on the Soviet Embassy through photographic surveillance; and to provide operational support

to the Station in the form of rental of sate-quarters, counter- surveillance, and procuring and servicing letter drops. The Division reels that both aspects of the project are worthwhile to the Station's activities. It considers that the project is now operating at optimum size and does not plan to expand. In the coming period efforts will be made to refine and better use the existing organizational arrangements.

4. Appropriate Special Staff elements recommend renewal of this project.

Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1.  "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this objective.

a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example, operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair safes. Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to exploit this information in another manner.

b. SCANTLING is still the Station's primary source for keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK personnel in Mexico City. This is accomplished in several ways; the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal request for additional details).

2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING is very useful for collecting information on other Station targets:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 219

SECRET/OR

-2-

a. On the basis of a request to the Station from the ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO demonstrations. Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired Information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961. SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local Mexico City address. This case has been of considerable counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with the subject's neighbors and associates,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings, and surveillances." SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below:

a, SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy. SCANTLING talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was primarily responsible for the later success of the recruitment made by another Station agent.

b. Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. Sce the last renewal for additional details on this case,

c. In connection with the above objective SCANTI.ING has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE components,

SECRET/K


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 220

SECRET/OK

-3-

d. SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is considered sufficiently related to mention here.

4. In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,
   SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
   Station. For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and
   will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962. Also,
   during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance
   team until July 1961 when Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
   City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
   for other Station operations.

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
   although SCANTLING'S LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
   fulfilled, It. is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
   valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
   other Station activities in general, SCANTLING's production, measured
   against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
   unquest lonably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project
   LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
   personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses."
   Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
   to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
   description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute
   to the above objective. There has been no change in the coverage as
   described in the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.

2. "To collect operational information and identify operational
   leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP
   operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this

SECRET/YK


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 221

SECRET/

-4-

objective. In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four
months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation. For
several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded
from the LIENTRAP vehicle. Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i. e.,
   rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances."
   GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
   Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area
   knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
   extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities, GERENDE
   also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
   Station operations requiring them.

4. The quality and quantity of operational information produced
   by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
   and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,
   that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued,

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so. The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
Information in support of other Station operations.

II. CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project
year except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)
surveillance team in July 1961 in accordance with previous plans.

III. EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the validity of the remarks made in Section III of last year's project renewal request.

IV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused any known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA base was reactivated on 29. May 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be ever alert for any unusual.incidents which might indicate that the base has been compromised. This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project during the past project year.

V. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Rather, efforts will be devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational arrangements.

VI. COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY expended $21, 458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960- 30 June 1961) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about $11,000.00. It is anticipated that about $8,000.00 will be expended during the last two months (October and November 1961) of the project. year. This will make a total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500.00, or some $12, 500.00 under the budget estimate of $53,000.00.

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $49, 500.00 budget, itemized below, $29, 500,00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the balance, $20,000.00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accounting procedures will be used for all expenditures.

## REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the last Project Review forwarded as an attachment to HA-14093, 13 November 1959) to provide worthwhile and significant information pertaining to the above objective. There follow a few examples of SCANTLING's production:

a. A detailed casing of the LIMERICK electrical power supply was forwarded to Headquarters as an attachment to HMA-14496, 12 February 1960. The production of this type of operational information, which takes several weeks to compile accurately, illustrates the unusual talents possessed by SCANTLING together with his valuable contributions to the Station's operational information collection effort.

b. SCANTLING has been used frequently to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/ LIMERICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For example, in May 1960, LIFEAT indicated that the LIMERICK target was having considerable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES concerning the handling of incoming and outgoing shipments. By discreet investigation, SCANTLING was able to provide the Station with additional pertinent information about the address, owner and type of business engaged in by the firm. Such information then becomes readily available for exploitation should a LIMERICK shipment of particular interest come to the attention of the Station.

c. SCANTLING is the Station's primary investigative asset for keeping track of current residence addressees of LIMERICK personnel. The Station considers it important from the counterespionage standpoint to maintain information on the location of all


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 233

## -2-

LIMERICK residences. In addition, specific targets are continually considered for LICOOL installations. A recent example of SCAITLING's efforts in this connection would be the spotting and acquisition of the LIMOTOR base in the same apartment building with LITALOK -1. Contributions of this type operational information are quite time consuming due to the necessity for checking cut several apartments that a LIMERICK individual may initially be considering as a residence.

2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest operating in Mexico." As indicated below, SCANTLING is also extremely useful for collecting information on targets other than LIMERICK:

a. In March 1960 SCANTLING was instrumental in locating property adjacent to the LITABBY installation which the Station has since rented in anticipation of initiating photographic and technical operations. SCANTLING was able to accomplish this assignment only after a thorough casing and pretext investigations of the several pieces of property appropriate for such operations.

b. SCANTLING is also used to follow up sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and sister targets (See example as to type under I,A,1, b and c above).

c. SCANTLING was used as an investigative asset to determine the local address and exact employment of Gordon William GROVES (201-220025), a counterespionage case of interest to Headquarters and ODENVY.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments debriefings, and surveillances." As examples of SCANTLING's contribution to this objective, the following cases are listed:

a. SCANTLING devoted a considerable amount of time to his attempts to locate Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez, a known agent of a Communist Country. He followed various leads on GONZALEZ from March to August 1960 before


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 234

SECRET

-3-

GONZALEZ was finally identified and his Mexico City home and business addresses were ascertained. See FANA-15626, 9 September 1960, for further details on this case.

b. The preliminary investigative work on a KUSODA case of priority interest was conducted by SCANTLING. During this investigation it was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to Aquascalientes, Guanajuato and Minatitlan to obtain the information required by Headquarters. Sce the attachments to HUNT-1416, 20 May 1960, for the results of the investigation.

4. In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements of the Station. For example, SCANTLING handled several of Raymond H. GERENDE's (ps) operations while the latter was away from Mexico City during August and September 1960. Also, SCANTLING has been managing the LIJERSEY surveillance team since the departure of Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960. It is hoped that SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon as the LITEMPO project is approved. SCANTLING has also been used to spot and rent safe houses for various Station operations, a valuable operational support service.

5. As stated in the preceeding Request for Project Renewal, al though SCANTLING'S LIEPTY Project objectives can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station activities in general. SCAN TLING'8 production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Froject LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses." Together with their extensive photographic coverage of the LIMERICK target, the photographic bases also contribute other types of operational information:

a. LIMITED - This base compiles daily logs indicating all arrivals, demrtures and, where possible, identities of every person visiting or working at the LIMERICK target.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 235

# SECRET

-4-

This information is particularly useful in keeping track of LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of visitors to the installation. Also, LIMITED maintains a summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the presence or absence of an employee on any given day. Finally, one other significant service is performed by this base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity. LIMITED's photographic.coverage is still concentrated on visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK installation. A recent example of the base's contributions to Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit the LIMERICK target on a certain day. The base was alerted to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any person appearing to be an American. The results of this assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other cables. LIMITED was also able to provide photographs, which when compared with photographs provided by Head-quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity.

b. LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year. In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares weekly reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, IILYRIC also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC photograplis also are con- centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees, It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maintains photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day except Sunday.

c. LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK employees and their families. Also, the base operator,

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 236

SECRET/

-5-

LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target employees. He accomplishes this objective by careful observation and analysis. LICALLA also maintains a daily attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA coverage of the target, both photographic and physical observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-espionage effort.

2. "To collect operational information and identify operational leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation, handled by GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective. It has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform pretext Investigations in support of numerous Station activities. The cases listed below are cited as examples:

a. In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3, a, above) LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters provided photographs, left no doubt that GONZALEZ was the subject of interest to Headquarters.

b. LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon, a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext investigation of the residents of an apartment building where CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the results of the Investigation with excellent photographs of the subject,

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i, e., rent hotel roorns and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances," GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many Station operations requiring them.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 237

SECRET/N

-6-

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project is worthwhile and should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational information produced.

C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational leads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity." During this project year the LIJERSEY surveillance team under the direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support efforts through pretext investigations and physical surveillances. Some examples of the team's work are listed below:

a. Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) is a Guatemalan Communist which the team had under surveillance from November 1959 to April 1960. The surveillance, together with information acquired from other sources, eventually resulted in an unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER.

b. Pericles FRANCO Ornes (201-64546) - FRANCO is a Dominican of interest to the Station. The LIJERSEY ream devoted portions of five mouths, January to May 1960, collecting Information on subject through physical surveillance.

c. Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201- ) was the subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960. LOPEZ was later deported from Mexico through the efforts of LITEMPO-2.

d. CLACKETT and the LIJERSEY team performed numerous pretext Investigations on Station targets of opportunity and on three separate occasions during the project year served as a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other operations.

2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to LITEA-1. Although not specifically covered by the project objectives, this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con- tribution to the Station's support efforts.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 238

SECRET

-7-

3. In view of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31 August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project wipl not be renewed. However, for the record, it is considered that the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIJERSEY operations were justified.

D. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so. The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information in support of other Station operations.

II. CHANGES

A. Simon D. CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team during the past year. As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis; consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would permit the Station to continue to profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.

B. Oliver G. SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the LIJERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of the LITEMPO project. SCANTLING has been exposed to, and likewise knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20. SCANTLING is known to L-20 only by an alias.

III. EFFECTIVENESS

A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the
Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only
as good as the support mechantsins backstopping and contributing to them,
The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as
the LIEMPTY Project, to investigate leads and to collect operational
Information is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counterespionage objectives. The Station would be seriously handicapped
in its operational activities should the support services of such agents as
GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly
made unavailable.

B. LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-
espionage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require detailed
knowledge of the identity, activities and fellow associates of LIMERICK
personnel. The LIEMPTY photographic basehouses undoubtedly provide
more of this type information than any other Station operation. The
production from LIEMPTY photographic bases and from the LIENVOY
project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 240

SECRET/
-9-

C. Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments and other essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers highly significant. It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs cạn be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in support of sensitive operations and activities.

D. Although the progress and success of any support project depends upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project year.

IV. PROBLEMS

A. Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT technicians by the Cuban Government. One of the technicians was known to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA is located in one of these units) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend photo- graphic operations pending resolution of the situation. At this time, there is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed. The LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians. No other security problems have occurred during the past year.

V. PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year considerable progress has been made in the Station's handling, i, e., sorting, Indexing, identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.

B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using HY-PAN film in night photography. - HY-PAN_film_was used-on-a-trial basts during daylight hours with poor results. Almost invariably, prints

SECRET/


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 241

SECRET/

-10-

from HY-PAN negatives were too grainy and, consequently, were of little use in producing good identified shots of individuals. In view of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted. It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result of this new film.

C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim responsibility for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LIJERSEY team to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an appreciable amount. It is not planned, during the coming year, to expand present LIEMPTY activities.

VI. COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY expended $19, 120.91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (1 December 1959-30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through 31 October 1960) expended $16, 734,69, Contract Agents salaries and allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11 months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00. An additional $4,000.00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year. This will bring total project expenditures to about $54,000.00 for the entire project year.

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below, $31, 900.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1961 and the balance, $21, 100.00, should be expended during Fiscal Year 1962. Normal accounting procedures will be used for all expenditures.

## VII, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS
As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No. 230-60, Annex A, for communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions," the Station does nor anticipate that this project would or could continue to function under its present objectives. However, both principal agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse conditions. Both of these agents identify themselfs, in terms of ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as Mexican nationals (which they are). It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would become valuable contacts in any emergency situation.

The Station is aware that the previous project renewal stated that emergency communications arrangments were being made. The Station has finally obtained the U.

SUBJECT: LIEMPTY Project Renewal

ACTION REQUIRED: Paragraph 2 - Please submit detailed review of usefulness and value of the photo basahouses, Are three justified?

REFERENCE(S): EPMA-14093, 13 November 1959

1.  The LIEMPTY Project was renewed on 8 January 1960 for the period 1 December 1959 through 31 November 1960 for a total of $84,910; $48,485 for fiscal year 1960 and $36,425 for fiscal year 1961.

2.  The following staff comments were made during the renoval processs:

a. KUDESK notes that the CI value of the project is difficult to judge since it appears that much of the material produced remains in the Station for exploitation. However, KUDESK remarks that the value of the project should be increased when the CLACKETT surveillance team enters into active operation, KUDESK suggests that the Station be queried as to the pretext or circumstances under which SCANTLING frequently visits Ines Pareda de Nareno, the occupant of the property adjacent to the Soviet installation.

b. KUTUBE/OPS notes that while the project review presents a clear picture of the aims and objectives of the various segments, it does not provide, except in the case of SCANTLINO, detailed indication of the value or usefulness of the other segments, particularly the photographic activity. KUTUBE/OFS requests that the Station provide such an appraisal during the first quarter of 1960. KUTUBE/OPS recommends strongly that the photo coverage be reviewed from the standpoint of value and usefulness with a view to determining whether the LILYRIC activity could not be safely eliminated and the additional photographic coverage conducted on a more selective basis, without materially affecting overall usefulness, KUTUBE/OPS notes that, in the absence of further proof of usefulness, the color photography and moving pictures appear to be an unnecessary luxury. KUTUBE/OPS recommends the careful handling of the CLACKETT segment and requests that the next project action include examples of the team's progress.

3.  The TVA approval for the additional vehicle was forwarded under Dispatch No. HMMS-1211. The MV number assigned by JBECHO is MV 2320. The usual Delegation of Procurement authority is being forwarded by JBECHO channels.

Ext. 2555
Date 9 December 1959

1. It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be renewed for the period 1 December 1959 through 30 November 1960 for a total of $84,910.00; $48,485.00 for fiscal year 1960 and $36,425.00 for fiscal year 1961. LIEMPTY was last approved for the period 1 December 1958 through 30 November 1959 for a total of $95,380; of which it is estimated $74,259 has been obligated.

2. It is requested that the Project be renewed on the basis of the Project review prepared by the Station which is attached.

3. The security incident referred to in paragraph IV.B on page 6 of the attachment, occurred on 20 September 1959. While on an operational assignment LIEMPTY/10 and the LIENTRAP vehicle were temporarily detained by the Servicio Secreto de Mexico (Mexican Secret Service). At the time of the incident the LIENTRAP vehicle was carrying out an assignment of photographing a Cuban rally which it was expected would be attended by many of the leading Mexican and Central American Communists. The police were also covering the meeting for the purpose of preventing a Communist-inspired demonstration and they searched LIENTRAP believing it might contain Communist propaganda. When they saw the film they seized the film, the truck and LIEMPTY-10 with the belief the Communists had filmed some rough-handed techniques used by the police against some persons attending the rally. LIENFTY-10 was held under unofficial custody for approximately 26 hours before his release was obtained. When a member of the Station using State Department covor intervened with the police on behalf of LIEMFTY-10, the film, LIENTRAP, and all the equipment were also returned in tact. LIENFTY-10 had not been interrogated and had not been formally charged or booked. Although the FBI representative and the U.S. Embassy Security Officer also learned of the incident, the Station does not believe that this incident has materially effected the security of the Project. The Station, however, is allowing a one month's cooling off period for the LIENTRAP vehicle and LIEMPTY-10.

# REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I. PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities." During the past year SCANTLING has devoted a significant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although other Station operations and personnel are also concerned with is collection of operational information about LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources. For example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the source of information about LIMERICK physical facilities. He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, construction activities and the kinds of outside services utilized by the LIMERICK installation. He regularly visits Inez PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Senora de Moreno about any unusual activities which she may have observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all other residences and establishments in the same block. This operational information is intended for KURIOT's use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical meters for measuring the amount of electrical power used and the precise points where wires enter each property. Because of his other sensitive activities and because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station. During the time he spent training Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) in radio controlled mobile surveillance, SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work at the LIMERICK installation; however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLACKETT on dispatching techniques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance team using two-way radios.

2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest operating in Mexico." By far the most important contribution made by SCANTLING in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a pretext cover story. During this visit SCANTLING managed to collect highly valuable operational information about the security of the installation, which has added materially to KUBARK's knowledge about the target. SCANTLING has also cased and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 250

SECRET

-2-

a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type
activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station
targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported
in separate correspondence.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings
   and surveillances." This objective was included in the LIEMPTY project because
   SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LIEMPTY
   photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of
   leads obtained from the above sources. The information resulting from these in-
   vestigations has enabled the Station to maintain current data on the various firms
   used by the LIMERICK target and in one instance, Octavio VIDALES (201-
   ).
   caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical
   penetration of the LIMERICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the
   Station anticipates that SCANTLING will some day be successful in just this type of
   activity. SCANTLING is the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/
   LIMERICK and LIEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the
   primary target.

4. Not covered by a specific project objective but, névertheless, of
   significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributions to the overall
   Station support efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT,
   SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for
   use by the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. He devised a superior method for
   numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location
   without reference to street names and areas. The entire radio dispatch code, when
   used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine
   surveillance team. From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted
   an investigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 years old and
   reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision
   to terminate LIVESTOCK-2. SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting
   hotel rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supporting operations such as
   LICOOL-12 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible
   cutout between the Station and agents from other geographical areas.

5. Although SCANTLING'S LIEMPTY objectives can never be completely
   fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
   contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station
   activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured against monetary.
   expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies
   his continuation as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

SECRET/


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 251

SECRET

-3-

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities through the use of photographic base houses." This continuing objective is carried out by three photographic base houses, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA. During the project year, LIMITED produced approximately 3600 photographs and LILYRIC about 4500 pictures of individuals entering and leaving the LIMERICK target. Most of these photographs were of non-LIMERICK individuals of which only a small, but significant, percentage could be identified through license plate checks or other types of routine investi- gation. The LICALLA base produced approximately 4300 photographs during the year. Most of the LICALLA photographs were of LIMERICK employees and their families and have been of considerable value in maintaining current and accurate listings of LIMERICK personnel in Mexico. The LICALLA base has recently begun taking motion pictures of LIMERICK personnel conversing in the garden area. These movies are being forwarded to KUTUBE/D for the possible exploitation of lip reading analysis. The LIMITED base, in addition to its photographic assignment, is also used as the radio central for dispatching the LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel targets. All bases make routine reports on the daily attendance of LIMERICK employees at the installation which facilitates the Station's reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel, Also, the bases devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK employees. Some of this latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associato with their colleagues.

2. "To collect operational information and identify operational leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." This is a broad objective and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation. LIENTRAP is used to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justify a more permanent photographic base. During the period under review, LIENTRAP has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group activities, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL) -headquarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest. The operational information produced by LIENTRAP is used by the Station for increasing operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i. e., rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances." GERENDE, because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, is used frequently by the Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictitious names for use on other Station operations. He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office boxes for use as letter drops. This objective pertains entirely to the operational support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security of important Station activities.

SECRETAR


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 252

4. The production of operational information as represented by LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP is an important adjunct to the Station's coverage of the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity. It is the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARK assets, i. e., money and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued.

C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational leais pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity." Very little production has been realized from this objective in terms of CLACKETT'S contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving surveillance, tradecraft and photography training in Headquarters. He then spent the rest of April, May and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobile surveillance techniques. Then LIEMPTY8 15, 16, 17 and 20 were placed under his supervision and he began training these agents in the arts of foot surveillance and mobile surveillance. This team, known a's the LIJERSEY team, is just beginning to show the excellent effects of CLACKETT's intensive training sessions. Although LIEMPTY-17 has resigned and the team consists of only four agents, including CLACKETT, the Station believes that the team will be ready within the next month to begin its contributions to the above objective.

2. Based on the training time devoted to CLACKETT and to the LIJERSEY team and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's opinion that this activity should be continued.

II. EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN FURTHERED.

Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project is not intended nor designed to produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information in support of other Station operations.

III. PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:

1. SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same now as they were when the original LIEMPTY project outline was submitted. Since SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LIEMPTY, progress, other than covered in the above section on production, can be measured only by the fact that SCANTLING is a year older and has acquirei a few more helpiül tricks of the trade

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 253

SECRET/

-5-

and, consequently, has increased his own operational abilities.

2. Insofar as future planning is concerned, SCANTLING will continue to devote the greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In addition, he will continue his work against the LIMERICK target, i.e., investi- gating LIFEAT and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives of the LIEMPTY and LIMESA projects. The Station still plans to maintain SCANTLING as an independent Station asset free from the responsibilities of super- vising other agents and operations.

3. SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative support to LIEMPTY-3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be responsible for the operational direction of L-3.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment:

1. During the past year the three photographic base houses have been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of photographs on dark cloudy days. One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently begun making 35mm color slides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not possible. It is the Station's opinion that a few color photographs of target personnel will be useful for identification purposes. The LICALLA Base has also, during the past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that Headquarters can eventually provide lip reading analysis of conversations taking place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation.

2. Other operational progress has been made in connection with relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team. This now leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory.

3. Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for expansion. Rather, the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures now in use and to experiment with night photography possibilities using the fast HY-PAN film with telephoto lens of varying lengths. GERENDE will also concentrate on increasing the security and communications procedures used with each base.

C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment:

1. CLACKETT's assumption of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional and much needed support ascet. Although the LIJERSEY team has been in existence for several years, it was only during the past year, with the assignment of

SECRET/


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 254

SECRET/

- 6 -

1.  CLACKETT, that an intensive effort was made to train the team members and to place them under the supervision of a full time team leader. As mentioned above, CLACKETT has done an excellent job during the past few months in getting the team ready for future operational assignments.

2.  The Station plans, during the coming year, to increase the strength of the LIJERSEY team by at least two agents and one car. This would then give a total LIJERSEY complement of six agents and three radio cars. The Station will continue to take all necessary precautions not to rush the development of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult. It is anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party penetration program.

IV. PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION, SECURITY AND COVER.

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained and motivated agent, SCANTLING's production during the period under review was excellent. His production is in the category of operational information rather than positive intelligence and is based on leads and investigations given him by the Station. He never fails to do a thorough and detailed job on all assignments given to him. He is an unusually valuable *principal agent*. There have been no security problems or developments during the past year in connection with SCANTLING's assignments. Likewise, his cover is very good and places him in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE - Since GERENDE's marriage in December 1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree. He has become one of the Station's most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings, completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task, regardless of how menial it may be. Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know, his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well. In fact, GERENDE recently was able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE's firm. This, of course, endears GERENDE to LISTERINE in addition to contributing to GERENDE's cover employment. The only significant security incident pertaining, in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LIENTRAP (please see HMMA-13951, 16 October 1959, for details).

C. Simon D. CLACKETT - CLACKETT's performance has definitely measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine activities. He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance as

SECRET/


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 255

SECRETA

- 7-

he gains more experience. There have been no security problems or incidents in connection with CLACKETT's assignment to this Station. Although the notional cover provided by Headquarters has held up very well during the past few months, the Station had hopes of placing him in LILABEL's firm and obtaining Inmigrante papers for him. However, for reasons mentioned in other correspondence, this cover arrangement did not work out. The Station is continuing efforts to locate another suitable local cover job for CLACKETT.

V. CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION.

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING on the average of three times each week. For regular meetings, a total of eight prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING "walking the beat" and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter's car. This procedure enables both the agent and the case officer to check themselves and to check each other for possible surveillance. Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than 30 minutes, and are held in the car. It is possible for SCANTLING to get in touch with his case officer by telephone, and vice versa, in case an unscheduled meeting is necessary. SCANTLING and the Station are currently working on the details of an emergency means of contact utilizing SCANTLING's wife's relatives in PBPRIME. Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements to facilitate contact with SCANTLING in the event Mexico is overrun by hostile forces and contact with the Station is severed,

B. Raymond H. GERENDE - GERENDE's Case Officer meets with him five times each week. Meetings are conducted in the Case Officer's car using the same procedures as outlined above. GERENDE and his Case Officer have a total of 11 contact points in different areas of the city and generally hold their meetings during the early morning hours, usually about 0800. As in the case of SCANTLING, GERENDE and his Case Officer are preparing an emergency contact procedure which will facilitate Headquarters communications with him through his relatives in PBPRIME Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements just as soon as they are completed.

C. Simon D. CLACKETT - The Station Case Officer meets with CLACKETT on the averageof three times each week. The same type of communications pro- cedures as used for SCANTLING and GERENDE are employed with CLACKETT.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI/OPS

FROM : Chief, WHD

SUBJECT : LIETTY Project

1. Reference is made to your comments on the LINFTY Project which was approved on 16 January 1959.

2. The LIFTY Project provides for the development of the former LIJERSEY surveillance team, the maintenance of photo surveillance bases, and other support facilities for the Mexico City Station. In their review of the Project before it was approved, FI/OPS suggested that WI! Division consider a gradual reduction of the considerable financial and personnel commitments in this project in view of the favorably developing LIENVOY liaison relationship. FI/OPS believed that a amallar, more manageable support group with greater emphasis on selectivity of tasks and targets could well result in more effective CI and FI productivity..

3. The Mexican desk wishes to point out that rather than reducing the assets carried under the LIETTY Froject, WID believes that this project is an extremely important one and should receive Headeuarters support. The only other Station surveillance teams, LIVESTOCK and LISPRACE, are both known to the Mexican authorities. Therefore LISTTY remains the Station's only secure surveillance asset. It is a very small untrained unit at present, but through this project it will be developed into a useable, valuable asset.

4. We are not passing FI/OP's comment to the field, because WH Division: believes that unilateral assots should not 'e reduced in favor of liaison. First, the liaison has not yet been firmly established. Secondly, even with a good liaison relationship, the Mexican services must be considered anything but secure, and certainly could not be trusted with any sensitive operations. Thirdly, because of its proximity to the United States, and the activity of hostile intelligence groups there, the Mexico City Station is called upon to support many very sensitive operations which we would never wish to reveal to the Mexican authoritios.

5. Experience in other latin


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 266

Page 2

5. Experience in other latin American countries where liaison has been established, has shown that many Station's tend to reduce their unilateral operations and capabilities in favor of the liaison. Under these circumstances, the production of the Stations have often been at the mercy of the liaison service and a change in the attitude of the service toward cooperating with this Agency has left these Stations virtually helpless. We certainly cannot recommend that the Mexico Station reduce any of it's unilateral support assets in favor of a proposed liaison relationship.

SUBJECT: Operational/LIC-PTY Project Approval

1.  The Field Project Outline submitted with HCA-11257 was approved on 16 January 1959 without change, for the period 1 December 1958 through 30 November 1959 for a total of $95,330; $65,580 for the current fiscal year and $29,800 for fiscal year 1960.

2.  An amendment to the original request for project approval we.s submitted before the original project was approved. This amendment requested approval to include Simon D. CLACKET? (ps) and Wilma J. FIORDALISI (ps) under the LIFTY Project effective 1 January 1959 and remove them fron the LIMESA Project. The funds designated in the original FPO for the undesignated Staff Agent were used to cover the expenses for CLACKETT and FIORDALISI. Therefore no additional funds were requested for the project in this spendment. The approval on 16 January 1959 included tis project amendment. A copy of the amendment request is being forwarded for your information and records.

3.  Among the Staffs' comments on the LIEIFTY Project, the following recommendations were made. KUDEK suggested that the Case Officer should work at devising ostensible sources of incomes for the agents which will stand the scrutiny of friends, relatives and less friendly forces.

4.  An amendment to CLACKETT's contract has been requested to allow for a quarters allowance. The educational allowance requested in paragraph 11 of the project amendment was disapproved because CLACKETT was a Contract Agent. The Quarters Allowance of $2,500 was turned down because it was too high in relation to CLACKETT'a salary. Therefore, a quarters allowance of $1,800 has been approved and will be written into CLACKSTI"s contract. If, however, operational and cover reasons require CLACKETI to rent an apartment larger than the one he would normally obtain under his allowance, the Chief of Station can authorize the extra rent as an operational expense which will rot be considered as compensation for CLACKETT and therefore not subject to federal income tax.

5.  Please advise Headquarters whether you wish to have the cryptonyms for CLACKSTT and FIORDALISI charged to LIEPTY's.

PROJECT OUTLINE

PART I

IDQM-A-11257
-1472

1. Area of Operations

The general area of operations will be Mexico and the specific area will be Mexico, D.F., Mexico.

2. Purposе

The purpose of this project is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information in support of other Station operations. This purpose is in consonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

3. Background

As the reviewing authorities will be aware, this project includes several operations which were formerly carried under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY. Partially as a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK compromise, when three surveillance team members were apprehended and placedin custody by the Mexican Police, and additionally as a means for the orderly administration of assets, this new project is submitted.

There follows below a background sketch of the separate support assets, excluding details concerning personnel which will be discussed later in the outline, which the Station proposes for inclusion in LIEMPTY:

LIMITED - The LIMITED Base is located in such a position across the street from the LIMERICK installation that photographs can easily be made of persons enter- ing and leaving the LIMERICK main gate. These photographs are later developed and printed by LIEMPTY-4, then returned to the LIMITED operator for the proper annotations. After receipt of the photographs by the Station, the Case Officer reviews them for LIMESA leads, newly arrived LIMERICK personnel, local and other nationals of possible operational interest and PBPRIME citizens who have visited LIMERICK.

KUBARK owns the property housing the LIMITED Base, having purchased it in mid- 1955; however, the ostensible owner is LIMOUSINE, to whom LIEMPTY-6 pays his rent each month through LIMOUSINE's bank.

LIMITED, with LIEMPTY-6 as base house operator, has been operating for nearly three years and has not yet been involved in a compromising security situation. Prior to Apr11 1955, when Headquarters authorized the purchase of the LIMITED Base, the Station rented the Base and used LIPSTICK-7 (later LIMESTONE-6 in LIFEAT Project and now terminated) as the operator. This arrangement was in effect for about two years.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 272

HMM-A-11257
KAPOK-1472

-3-

LILYRIC - This Base has been in operation for about two and one-half years and is located in an apartment building across the street from the LIMERICK installation. As in the case of the LIMITED Base, LILYRIC takes photographs of persons entering and leaving the main gate of the LIMERICK installation. The LILYRIC photographs are handled in the same manner as the LIMITED pictures. In addition to taking photographs, the LILYRIC operators also prepare daily logs on the activities of each LIMERICK employee, record the license plate numbers of most cars carrying people to and from the LIMERICK installation, and prepare an observation diary on all target personnel seen each day. (This permits the Station to tell when a target personality is cut of town or not working for some other reason.)

The LILYRIC Base vas originally acquired and made operative to provide for continuous coverage of the target in the event LIMITED is ever compromised. This is still the primary value of having two bases cover the same portion of the target. LILYRIC is compartmented from LIMITED and with the possible exception of GERENDE could probably weather any security flap involving LIMITED. Obviously, there is some duplication in the work of LIMITED and LILYRIC; however, the insurance value of having two basis is quite apparent.

LILYRIC has been operating for about two and one-half years and insofar as the Station knows, no compromising security situations have arisen.

LICALLA - The LICALLA Base is located in a position where photographs can be taken of people within the LIMERICK garden area. In addition, the operator of the LICALLA Base submits veekly reports on LIMERICK construction work, daily logs showing when a target individual was seen that day, and reports showing the association of target individuals with one another. LICALLA photographs are processed and handled in the same manner and by the people who handle the LIMITED and LILYRIC pictures.

The LICALLA Base vas acquired and operations began about two and one-half years ago with the primary purpose of obtaining additional operational information concerning LIMERICK personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for the physical penetration of the LINERICK installation. Approximately one year ago the LICALLA Base was purchased by KUBARK through LIMOUSINE. LICALLA will probably remain at its present location and will continue to submit photographs and reports of the same type as are now being submitted. Other than the fact that LIEMPTY-9, the LICALLA operator, is the brother of former LIPSTICK-47, no security problems are currently known to the Case Officer. However, reports from LIPSTICK2 12 and 30, the local police, the attorneys involved in the case, the foreign embassy concerned and the ICFLUTTER tests give no indications that LIEMPTY-9 vas ever mentioned during the LIPSTICK flap.

LIENTRAP - This is a panel type truck equipped with cameras, telescopic lens and other types of photographic equipment. It has been used during the past two years as an investigative asset. The truck is parked about 75 yards from a target of interest (usually a residence or apartment building) and the photographer in the rear of the truck photographs individuals or things of interest to the Station. LIENTRAP is a valuable asset for any station to have and has enabled this Station to get pictures of individuals which could have been obtained in no other way. LIEMPTYS-10 and 11 operate LIENTRAP.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 273

HMM-A-11257
ΚΑΡΟΚ-1472

The major security threat to LIENTRAP is the fact that it has been operating for about two years in all parts of the city and should soon be replaced by a truck of a different make. Provision for this is made in Section 15 of this Field Project Outline.

LIJERSEY - This is presently an approved project; however, it is believed advisable for administrative efficiency to include the LIJERSEY assets within the framework of the LIEMPTY Project. Other than LILYRIC, which has already been discussed, LIJERSEY consists of a foot surveillance team with three members, LIEMPTYs-15, 16 and 17. LIEMPTYS 15 and 16 have been employed for about one and a half years and LIEMPTY-17 for about one year. They have not developed into as competent a surveillance team as the LIPSTICK team vas and probably never vill become as good. The LIJERSEY team has been used mostly for stationary surveillances and observations of people of interest. LIEMPTY-17, however, has also been used as a pretext investigator. He has excelled at this type of work and the Station continues to use him in this capacity. The Station has been reluctant to use the LIJERSEY team as much as it could have been used because of the close association of the team with GERENDE and, in turn, GERENDE's knowledge and work on LIFEAT and the LIPSTICK surveillance team. The Station plans to recruit several agents of a type and social level more suitable for all types of surveillance work than the present LIJERSEY team.

Oliver G. SCANTLING - SCANTLING has been associated with KUBARK for several years in a number of different capacities. He was originally used as a member of the LIPSTICK surveillance team and later was head of the same team. He has been used to train new agents in the techniques of surveillance and investigation, to acquire office space and apartments for the Station's operations and to conduct investigations and make recruitment approaches to individuals of operational interest to KUBARK. SCANTLING is currently being used by the Station as an investigator of LIMESA leads andis still actively pursuing the LIMESA/MKLIGHTING operation. SCANTLING also maintains regular contact with LIEMPTY-3 and monitors his elicitation effort against the LICOOL-6 target. In this connection, both SCANTLING and LIEMPTY-3 meet regularly with Doris M. KILIGO for operational guidance. (Note: Please see the LICOOL Field Project Outline for additional details on LICOOL-6).

5. Objectives:

Oliver G. SCANTLING's activities:

a. To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities.

b. To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest
operating in Mexico.

c. To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings and sur-
veillances.

Raymond H. GERENDE's activities:

d. To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and
physical facilities through the use of photographic base houses.

e. To collect operational information and identify operational leads pertain-
ing to Station targets of opportunity.

f. To provide operational support to Station operations, 1.e., rent hotel
rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.

Staff Agent's activities:

g. To collect operational information and to identify operational leads
pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.

6. Targets:

Oliver G. SCANTLING The primary target is, of course, the LIMERICK installation
and personnel. However, SCANTLING devotes most of his time to following up LIFEAT
leads which pertain to services provided the LIMERICK installation by individuals
and firms, e.g. construction engineers, floor waxing firms, safe experts, furniture
makers, interior decorators, etc. To an extent, these are considered targets of
opportunity and it would be impossible to list specifically what future targets
vill be available. One specific target which SCANILING is concerned with is the
occupant of the LICOOL-6 apartment; however, LIEMPTY-3, whom SCANTLING handles,
should more correctly be given credit for information produced on this target.

Raymond H. GERENDE - LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA all have as their target
the LIMERICK installation and personnel, plus any local nationals and PBPRIMERS
who visit LIMERICK. LIENTRAP is concerned with targets of opportunity and follow-
up investigations on operational leads obtained from other Station and Headquarters
sources. The same targets apply to the LIJERSEX surveillance team as apply to
LIENTRAP.

10. Cover:

a. Raymond H. GERENDE is the only LIEMPTY agent who has cover provided by KUBARK. GERENDE ostensibly is a salesman for LISTERINE's firm. However, he seldom spends any time pursuing his cover occupation, since his operational activities are so numerous and time consuming. GARENDE's cover with the LISTERINE firm was arranged by the Station and, so far, has been adequate for GERANDS'a needs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 280

# -11-

b. The Case Officer, Quinton N. OUSLER, is known only to GERENDE and SCANTLING. It would not be possible to develop a suitable cover story that would apply to the frequent meetings between the Case Officer and the Principal Agents; therefore, meetings are clandestine and are usually conducted in the Case Officer's car. However, suitable cover stories have been developed between the Case Officer and SCANTLING and between the Case Officer and GERENDE involving background information as to how we met and how our friendship developed, to be used in the event the Case Officer is apprehended with either of the Principal Agents.

c. None of the status cover occupations of any of the LIEMPTY agents is completely compatible with his operational activities. Action cover stories are decided upon before each assignment and devised to complement each agent's status cover as closely as possible. Base House operators, of course, generally conduct operational assignments within the confines of their quarters; consequently, the need for action cover stories is reduced. Appropriate cover stories exist between GERENDE and the agents in his network and between SCANTLING and LIEMPTY-3.

## 11. Contact and Communication:

Appropriate clandestine communications arrangements exist between the various echelons of LIEMPTY. At the present time these plans consist of regular and rapid-non scheduled (emergency) means of contact. GERENDE and SCANTLING are both in the process of preparing detailed written communications plans for their respective agents which include complete regular, alternate and rapid-non scheduled meeting arrangements. Provistons will also be made in these plans for oral recognition signals and physical bona fides that will enable a person unknown to the agent to contact him should the need ever arise. The Case Officer is currently working on a Warning System of Communications which will permit the expeditious exfiltration of GERENDE and SCANTLING from Mexico should a security situation arise which would necessitate this.

## 12. Control and Motivation:

a. Control - All LIEMPTY agents are local nationals. GERENDE and SCANTILING, both of whom spent a great deal of their childhood years in PBPRIME and still have relatives living in PBPRIME, are in many respects more pro-PBPRIME than many PBPRIME citizens. In the past, both GERENDE and SCANTLING have evidenced a high degree of loyalty to Matthew S. DINGLEY, their former Station Case Officer, and appear to be devoting that same loyalty to the present Case Officer. The control over GERENDE and SCANTLING stems directly from their pro-PBPRIME beliefs and their personal loyalty to their past and present Case Officers. The control over other LIEMPTY agents is based in part on pre-PBPRIME attitudes and on the financial remuneration and good handling they received from GERENDE and SCANTLING. Realistically, control over LIEMPTY agents is based on mutual understandings and confidence among individuals and should any agent decide to denounce PBPRIME or KUBARK, as the case may be, there is not much that the Station could do.

b. Motivation With the exception of GERENDE and SCANTLING, whose primary motivations are ideological, financial compensation seems to be the basic motivational factor surrounding LIEMPTY agents.

13. Equipment and Other Support:
    -12-
    No special equipment or other support is required at this time.

14. Timetable:
    The agents and operations listed in this project have previously been carried under the LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY Projects. It is the Station's understanding that the LIPSTICK Project was extended to 1 December 1958 to give the Station time to submit LIEMPTY. The LIJERSEY Project expires in 1959 or upon approval of LIEMPTY.

The LIEMPTY Project represents a major operational support asset of the Mexico City Station and, as such, will run for an indefinite period of time.

16. Special Problems and Commitments:

-15-

a. No commitments, expressed or implied, have been made to any LIEMPTY agent by the present Case Officer, except as stated in the project outline and/or in the contracts of GERZADE and SCANTLING.

b. In the event of compromise to the local government of any LIEMPTY agent, KUBARK is morally responsible for doing all within its power, and within the limitations of security, for resettling or otherwise taking care of the LIEMPTY agents.

c. No special benefit commitments have been made to any LIEMPTY agent except those contained in the contracts of GERENDE and SCANTLING.

d. A change of government or political conditions in Mexico will not affect this project. It is a unilateral effort on the part of KUBARK.

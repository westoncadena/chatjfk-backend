JUN 16 '11 15 AM '65

During the past year, this officer has continued to demonstrate his dedication and highly developed professional skills.

Subject has been called upon to meet a variety of requirements. The spectrum of his activity has been so broad that it has run from the exploitation of his manual dexterity (in installing technical devices) to the most sophisticated and demanding agent handling. Throughout the year, Subject has demonstrated his awareness of the value of KUBARK funds, which he spends as needed but always conscientiously. His reporting on his activities has been especially commendable, and his mastery of tradecraft has been continually in evidence.

Subject has now become Chief of PBRUMEN operations for Station Mexico. This slot was formerly held by a GS-15 officer. It is requested that Subject be promoted to the grade of GS-15, not only because of his present assignment, but in recognition of his fine past performance.

I concur generally with the assessment made of Mr. Shaw and agree that Shaw has turned in a highly commendable job and is an excellent operations officer. From here and not having the advantage of on-scene observation I would have rated Shaw with straight S' and overall rating of 'Strong' as compared to 'Outstanding.' Nevertheless, I strongly endorse the COS' recommendation for promotion for Shaw.

Supplement to Staff Employee Personnel

Action for Integration of Robert T. Shaw

Effective 27 March 1963

The purpose of this memorandum is to call your attention to existing policies which are particularly material to you while you are integrated and to set forth certain rights and obligations which are incident to your status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:

1. As an employee of this organization, at the present grade and salary of 08-14 $13,270 per annum, you will accept cover employment with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred to as "your cover facility") effective as of 27 March 1963. You will, insofar as consistent with your basic responsibility to this organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies of your cover facility; in order to appear as a conventional member of that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being effected at PRR-4 and salary of $11,800 per annum. You are prohibited, except as specifically authorized herein, from retaining emoluments paid by your cover facility.

2. It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour consists of a period of Two Years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of its expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent with your cover designation, will normally be at the direction of your cover facility. Such travel will be accomplished in conformance with applicable regulations of your cover facility except when you are directed for operational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations of this organization.

4. Salary and (except as provided in paragraph three (3) above) allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the extent that they are less than or equal to the salary and allowance payments due on the basis of your grade level with this organization. If such cover payments are less than the amount due, the difference will be credited to your payroll account with this organization. If such cover payments exceed the amount due, the overage will be remitted to this organization at designated intervals, presently

Computations hereunder will be made on the basis of the aggregate gross due and received provided, however, that in computing remittances for overage Federal and, if applicable, District of Columbia income taxes withheld by your cover facility against the overage may be deducted. To assure timely accuracy in your payroll account with this organization you are expected to immediately report cover facility payroll changes.

5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however, to preserve the security of your cover position.

a. Upon integration into your cover facility, you will continue to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended, and at your personal expense you will be subject to payroll deductions for retirement purposes (now six and one-half per cent) on the basis of your cover salary or your salary from this organization, whichever is the greater.

b. If you receive taxable income from both your cover facility and this organization, necessary adjustments for Federal, and if applicable, District of Columbia income tax purposes will be made in conformance with instructions received from this organization.

c. Consistent with your cover activity, you will continue to be responsible for compliance with the rules and regulations of this organization.

d. You are not assured upon the completion of your period of duty with your cover facility of any status with your cover based on your services performed with that organization at the request of this organization.

8. All anmual and sick leave which is accrued to your credit at the time of integration will be transferred to your cover facility. While integrated you will be permitted anmal leave, sick leave, home leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organi- zation. Upon completion of your integration your accrued annual and sick leave will be transferred to your credit with this organization. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a lump- sum payment for accrued annual leave, you will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization including any income taxes withheld by your cover facility.

6. You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all other information which you my obtain by reason hereof, unless you are released in writing by this organization from this obligation. Violation of such secrecy my subject you to criminal prosecution under the Espionage Lavs, dated 25 June 1948, as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations. The termination of your employment with this organization will not release you from the obligation of any security oath you may be required to take.

Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater re- sponsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

SUBJECT'S KNOWLEDGE OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS INCREASING AT A STEADY PACE. HE IS VERY ATTENTIVE TO HIS ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AND APPLIES IT VERY WELL. CONSIDERABLE INITIATIVE HAS BEEN SHOWN BY LEARNING NEW METHODS AND TECHNIQUES. THIS IS PARTLY DUE TO THE CORRESPONDENCE COURSE, IN PHOTOGRAPHY, IN WHICH HE IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED.

SUBJECT LACKS SOME CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO PRODUCE PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS, HOWEVER, IT IS FELT BY THE RATER THAT THIS IS DUE TO HIS LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN DARKROOM TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES. THE RATER FEELS CONFIDENT THAT SUBJECT WILL OVERCOME THIS LACK OF CONFIDENCE SOON.

### Part I - Lequest for Action

Raymund H. GERENDE Contract Agent

Name (Pseudaonym) STATUS (Career Agent, Contract Agent, Contract Employee)

Raise in salary - $500 per annum

PROPOSED ACTION (Incluce Eranch and/or field recommendations;
specific operational tas: performed by in-
divicual; views re long and/or short range
utility of incivicuel for Branch area and over-
all Division reeds)

The contract for Raymond H. GERENDE expires on 30 September
1965. The Mexico City Station has recommended that the contract
be extended for one year, and that GERENDE be granted a salary
increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum.

GERENDE received his last salary raise on 1 August 1963,
from $5,500 to $6,000. He was first placed under contract on
1 October 1955 at $3,600.

There are sufficient funds in the LIEMPTY Project to cover
this salary increase, and GERENDE's local cover job can logically
cover this additional income.

Part III

Chronological Narrative
Performance Report

NAME/PSEUDONYM:

(Summary of evaluation of past performance (if applicable) with emphasis
and details of current performance for assigned operational tasks)

DATES LOCATION AGENCY TASK

GERENDE was recruited in March 1955, just prior to his graduation from
the Mexico City College. He was trained as a member of a surveillance
team, and was also used as an investigator to collect operational data
on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was leader of
the team.

He was also used as a basehouse keeper in an audio operation and
processor of tapes. He excelled in this type of work because of his bi-
lingual Spanish/English facility, and, more importantly, due to his diver-
sified experience in clandestine operations which permitted him to spot
operational leads.

Since 1958 his primary use has been as main cutout/principal agent
to a group of photographic basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy,
and one mobile photographic truck. He processes the raw photographic take
and services the majority of the accommodation addresses used by the
Station. He has contributed significantly to the AMROD operation

He performs all his tasks in a professional manner. He is well suited
to intelligence work, and plans to make KUBARK his career. The Station
depends heavily on him because of his knowledge of Mexico, and his mobility
as a Mexican. He works full time for KUBARK; cover company requires very
little time.

In case of "New Hire" give a personality assessment in terms of
capability, attitude, and projected suitability; state names of
Division personnel who have interviewed him; give account of his
performance in current non-Agency job.

Reymond R. GERENDE

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES
Reference: HMW-12224 dated 24 January 1964

1.  Station Mexico City fully agrees with Headquarters evaluation of Subject as a "valuable long term asset with stay behind potential." In order to place the matter of the 2,100 pesos in the apropriate frame of reference it is felt that a few back-ground points should be noted.

In Jeminary 1956 the LIHMTY/LILYRIC basehouse was set up and placed in operation in a site which provided visual coverage of the LDERICK installation. A deposit of three months rent was made per terms of the rental contract at that time (2,100 pesos.) In April 1961 the building in which LIEMPTY/LILYRIC is located was sold by the owner. Normally tie rental deposit would have been transferred to the new comer as part of the sale transaction. However, approximately three months after the transfer of the property to the new omer, the rental deposit was returned to the basehouse operator, LIEMPTY-13. The deposit was then returned to GERENDE. GERENDE did not inform the then LIAUTY case officer nor the present case officer of the retim of the LIEMPTY/LILYRIC deposit. This 2,100 pesos continued to be carried on the station books as an outstanding operational advance charged to GRANDE. GEODE used part of this 2,100 pesos to make leans to two sib-agents (LINETY-6 ani LIEM-TY-9.) It is probably that he also used some of this on ocassion for his own purposes.

On 16 October 1963 OERENDE returned the 2,100 pesos to the case officer and the Station has adjusted its books to reflect the return of this money. CEREDE noted at the time of the return that he had this money intact but did not know how to go about returning it so long after having received it. This is the same as he stated at the time of the LCFLUTTER interview. GERENDE was obviously impressed with his inability to "beat" the LCFIUTTER. He was sincerely remorseful when talking to the case officer

about the incident and has twice stated that nothing of this nature would happen again. With the reality of future LCFLUTTER tests set firmly in O RENDE's mind, it is believed that he will not attempt any such action again.

As to what can be done of a positive nature (other than periodic re-LCPUTTER) to prevent recurrence it must be roted that GRANDE kept apart the 2.100 pesos which vere really still charged to him and the Station had no way of knowing that the mor.ey had been returned to him by the basehousekeeper. Only when the close coan of the LIO/
LILYRIC baschouse would be effected would the Station expect to have the rental deposit returned. Until such time the deposit would remain charged to GERADE. The only way to completely safeguard against this type of action would be for the case officer to meet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby eliminating GEREDE from the operation and causing unacceptable security risks. It is believed that periodic LCFLUTTER of GERENDE is the best insurance against a similar occurence in the future.

As to GERENDE's regular operational revolving fund, irregularities have never been discovered in his handling of these funds. Cash counts are conducted by the case officer to control the unspent portion of the revolving fund by comparison with accountings (receipts) GERENDE cakes every two weeks. GANDE's revolving fund is kept at the minimun amount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for which GERENDE is responsible.

The "other false claims" GERENDE admitted making involved occasional use of his vehicle for personal driving while entering all receipts for gas on his KUPARK accountings. Station does not consider this a major problem. If GENDE used his car for only operational employment any hostile surveillance of him would be relatively easy (1.e., surveilling only when he is using his QP vehicle) and it is believed that latitude must be allowed in this area for indigenous agents.

2. In the area of OERENDE's morale and his statement that he "is not being utilized to his full potential" the Station is as fully concerned as Headquarters. It should be noted however, that GRENDE has never written the report setting forth what he thinks he can do and when prodded on this has stated that he had been thinking about what additional work he could assume and that he "just does not know". The reason he gives is he does not know what else is being done in the operations area other than that to which he is already exposed. Additional operational work is assigned to GERENDE when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations. An example of this was his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station is reluctant to expose G-RIDE to additionel operations only for the purpose of Improving his morale" since he already has considerable knowledge of many Station past and going operations. The Station appreciates Headquarters coments on the results of OFRENDE'S LCFLUTTER and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GERENDE in the future.

REF: HMW-12065

1.  Reference is made to the results of the LCFLUTTER interview of Raymond H. GERENDE which was held on 8 October 1963. Headquarters would like to have a progress report on what steps have been taken by the Case Officer with regard to the 2,100 pesos which he had kept but belcged to KUBARK. Headquarters is also interested in what has been done about other falso claims he admitted making in his accountings, and what precautions are being taken to see that this does not continue in the future.

2.  The Station's comments are requested on GERENDE's statement that he is not being utilized to his full potential and that he often has free time. Beadquarters would be interested in seeing a copy of the report which the LCFLUTTER examiner suggested he write, setting forth what he (GERENDE) thinks he can do and what he would like to do. Headquarters considers GERENDE a valuable long tern asset with staybehind potential, and it is hoped that the Station will do what it can within the limits of security, to raise his morale and see that KUBARK is receiving full benefit of his services.

The latest LIEMPTY Project Renewal Request, recently forwarded to Headquarters, detailed GERENDE's duties. In Station's opinion, the noted salary increase is considered justified not only from agent's excellent job performance, but also as an incentive to continued superior work as well as an offset to the inflationary trend of the cost of living in Mexico.

3. It is requested that Headquarters initlate the appropriate amendment to GERENDE's contract Increasing his yearly salary to the noted figure of US $5,500.00 to be effective 1 January 1962.

UV Lamp for Raymond H. GEREDE

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

REF: HMMA-16102, 9 December 1960

1. As requested by reference, KURIOT is herewith forwarding the following:
   (Confirming documentation charging you for this item will be issued in the near future.)

Long Wave Ultraviolet Lamp

2. For ordinary F&S work, the difference between long and short wave lamps is very minor and the long wave UV lamp should prove adequate for the needs of Raymond H. GERENDE. Should a special need arise demanding the use of a short wave UV lamp by GERENDE, it will be supplied by KURIOT.

3. Disclosure of the existence, advantages, or uses of short wave UV lamps, or in any way making available such lamps to other than KUBARK personnel requires prior Headquarters approval. A copy of Instruction No. 20-2 containing the basic KURIP policy governing the use of short wave UV lamps is herewith enclosed for your guidance.

4. Short wave UV lamps embody a definite health hazard and should be used with caution. Short wave UV rays quickly cause sunburn, to which the eyes are particularly susceptible, and should not be used without wearing protective goggles. Ordinary eye glasses cut out most of the harmful rays, but even persons wearing glasses may receive harmful eye burns from UV rays entering at the sides of the glasses. Short wave UV lamps also produce small quantities of ozone so that the lamp should be used in a well ventilated room, which, of course, must also be darkened. For the above reasons, it is advisable to use only a long wave UV lamp whenever possible.

SUBJECT: Raymond H. GERENDE (ps)/Emergency Contact Arrangments

ACTION REQUIRED: None, for Headquarters information only

DATE: 23 November 1960

1.  In compliance with the KUBARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60, Annex A, concerning contact arrangments under emergency conditions, the following information, including recognition signals and bona fides, is forwarded for Headquarters records. Due to the sensitivity of the information, it was believed more appropriate to forward it separately rather than to include it with reference (Request for Renewal of Project LLIEMPTY).

2.  Insofar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could probably be contacted at one of the following places:

a. Present Residence: IDENTITY A

b. Mother's Residence: IDENTITY B

c. Cover Employment Address: IDENTITY C

3.  The following oral recognition signals, using the English language, are to be used as indicated:

CONTACT: "Mr. (GERENDE-true name), I bring the most sincere wishes and greetings from your Aunt and Uncle."

GERENDE: "Then you are referring to the IDENTITY D."

CONTACT: "No, I am referring to your other relatives in South Carolina, the IDENTITY E."

GERENDE: "Yes, Auntie is my Mother's sister."

4.  For use as physical bona fides, the Station is forwarding a one peso note with the serial number T348510 for Headquarters files. GERENDE has been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number, T348511, το keep in a safe place pending his having to show it to some future KUBARK contact. It has been explained to GERENDE that he is to show his half of the physical bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see his physical bona fides. GERENDE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contact's bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510).

5.  Assuming that adequate time will be available at the beginning of an emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret Writing so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY D or E addresses.

SUBJECT: Flaps & Seals Training of Raymond H. GENDE

ACTION REQUIRED: ALMATIC/Operational

REFERENCES: None

1.  In compliance with a Station Request, LIEMPTY principle agent Raymond H. GENDE, is being given training in basic flaps and seals techniques. It is felt advisable to have a second person outside the Station who can service this type of requirement in case HULFORD is prevented from doing so by the security situation arising from the ALPHER case.

2.  As an aid to this training, a copy of the portion of the MACHARITY Operations Manual (Section I.O.1.) dealing with basic flaps and seals work has been made and turned over to FREDE. A second copy is being forwarded herewith to Headquarters. This material was prepared on the basis of the content of the FURIOT training course of mid-1957. If FURIOT training is in possession of newer and improved techniques in this field and will make them available to MILFORD for use here, it would be greatly appreciated.

1.  Reference (o) forwarded a contract amendment which provided increased compensation and a termination settlement for Raymond H. GERENDE. This dispatch also requested that the Station comment on the provisions of the Terminal Payment clause as written into this amendment.

2.  Since the provisions of the original contract amendment ware written in general terms and did not specifically cover the circumstances under which GERENDE would be eligible for a terminal settlement as interpreted by the Station and outlined in reference (b), a revised contract amandrent was written. The attached contract amanduent also shows corrected compensation figures. The original contract amendment was incorrect due to the absence of the amendment, effective 1 September 1957, which increased GERENDE's compensation from $3,600 to $4,080.

3.  Sines GERENDE's originel contract was prepared at Headquarters and forwarded to you for oxsontion and retention, this amendment should follow the sare procedure. Therefore, the originel and one copy are attached for your action and retention. Heturn one signed copy.

4.  Reference (a) requested Headquarters to comment on a two-year extension for GERENDE' s contract, indicating that the extension should be fram i July 1959, the date of the last amendment, to 1 July 1961. Thera secas to be sous confusion on contract extension procedures which Headquarters would like to clarify at this point. Contract extensions are beeod on the date of the original contract not the wote. Accordingly, CERRADE' s contrect, originally effective 1 October 1955 and extended to 30 September 1959, was further extended for a period of two years from 1 October 1959 to 30 September 1961.

SUBJECT LIEMPTY/Contract Amendment for Raymond H. GERENDE (ps)

ACTION REQUIRED None, for Headquarters information only.

REFERENCES
A. HMMA-13063, 5 June 1959.

B. HMMW-7959, 12 August 1959.

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment No. One is GERUNDE's signed contract amendment, GERENDE is most appreciative for the raisse in salary and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment clause.

2. The Station interprets the Terminal Payment clause to mean any termination by the Government or acceptance of GERENDE's resignation in the "best interests of the Government." Examples in connection with the "best interests of the Government" interpretation would involve GERENDE's resignation for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a change of residence to some geographical area where his services could not be utilized by KUBARK. Assuming that no security problems are involved in making such a payment, the Station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to GERENDE's estate in the event of his death while in the employ of KUBARK.

3. The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as originally requested and concurs in Headquarters reasoning. Certainly, the Station would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he has been so informed, if he elects to resign just to receive some extra money or to pursue some other career. The Station hastens to add, however, that to the best of its knowledge, GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK job.

4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No. Two are the original and one copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957. Headquarters wili note that the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved by the Chief of Station, but was not formally witnessed. It is suggested that Matthew S. DINGLEY (ps), who is presently in Headquarters, be requested to witness the document. DINGLEY was the Case Officer handling GERENDE at the time this amendment became effective.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT Contract for GERENDE

In reviewing the last contract amendment, it came to note that CPD was deleting the original compensation figure of $3600 instead of the figure sent by the Station which was $4080. In checking this out, we find that we have no copy or notification of the amendment dated 1 September 1957 increasing his salary from $3600 to $4080, CPD is rewritting the contract without using a compensation figure for the amount to be deleted.

When we send this to the field, ask them to send us a copy of the contract amendment, dated 1 September 1957. Also inform them that they are to execute and retain the original copy of this new contract amendment. It may be well to point out that Subject's termination clause stipulates that he will received this benefit only if we terminate the contract.

SUBJECT: New Contract for Raymond H. GEKENDE (P)

ACTION BEQUIRED: Headquarters preparation of a new contract.

REFERENCEIS: HMMW-5626, 3 December 1957

1.  Raymond H. GERENDE was initially employed by the Station on 18 March 1955 under provisions of an oral agreement. Effective 1 October 1955 GERENDE was placed under a written contract, prepared by Headquarters, with an annual salary of $3,600.00. On 1 September 1957 his contract was amended to increase his salary to $4,080.00 per annum, which is the salary he is presently receiving. It is requested that a new two year contract he prepared, to be effective 1 July 1959, providing an increase in salary to $4,500.00 per annum and including a termination clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one month's salary, calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for each full year of his KUBARK employment. All other provisions of GERENDE's initial contract should remain in force. (The increase in salary to $4,500,00 per annum is already covered by the LIEMPTY Project.)

2.  As pointed out in the attachment to HΜΜΑ-11368, 22 October 1958, paragraph three of MEXI-2836, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Field Project Outline, GERENDE is a highly valued full-time Station asset who carries a significant work load and who has a great deal of responsibility. He is the LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA hase houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans-lation service and all the agents participating in these activities. He performs his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent abilities are showing continued improvement.

3.  Paragraph eight of HMMA-12095, 4 February 1959, indicated that the Station was considering amending GERENDE's contract to provide for some type of retirement benefits. Although it is recognized that indigenous agents are not usually granted such contract provisions, the Station believes that GERENDE should have monetary incentive, in addition to his idealogy, to make a long career with KUBARK. Accordingly, the Station recommends that GERENDE's new contract provide for a termination settlement of one month's salary for each full year that he has worked for KUBARK. In other words, should GERENDE's career with KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this period is $8,000.00,. then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum payment of $16,000.00. After considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow account and several other ideas, the Station considers the above proposal to come closest to meeting the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make KUBARK acareer. The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date for the coinputation of GERENDE's termination benefits.

HEADQUARTERS CASE OFFICE:

Name: J. B. Brady
Room: 2114 carton Hall
Ext.: 2555
Date: 23 June 1959

1. It is requested that approval be granted to amend Raymond H. GERENDE's contract to provide him with a termination settlement of one month's salary for each full year that he works for KUBARK and to raise his salary effective July 1959 from $4,000 to $4,560.00 per year. His last salary increase was granted on 1 September 1957. The date, 18 March 1955, has been suggested by the Station as the beginning date for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits. The Station believes that this benefit will provide GERENDE with the necessary incentive to make KUBARK a career and at the same time will give the Station an additional element of control.

2. As pointed out in the LIEMPTY Project Approval, GERENDE, an indigenous agent, is one of the Station's most valuable assets. He has a responsible full time job as the LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LITHIC and LICALLA base houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and translation service and all the agents participating in these activities. he performs his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent abilities are showing continued improvement.

3. Money was already allocated in the LIEMPTY Project approval for the salary increase. With the effective date of 18 March 1955, for the termination clause, GERENDE will already have accrued $1,520 (his salary is $4,560 per year) if he should resign today. The LIEMPTY Project, as approved, has sufficient funds to cover this cost if it is necessary to obligate this amount during the present Project year. Therefore, no additional funds are requested.

Chief of Station, Mexico City 4 February 1959

LILIPUTTY Progress Report - July thru Dec 1958

Note: for Headquarters information and files only.

## SYNOPSIS OF DEVELOPMENTS

1. During the period covered by this report, a new Case Officer, Quinton N. OWSLER, assumed operational direction of several LIPSTICK assets (Oliver G. SCANTLING, Raymond H. GERENDE, LIMITED, LIGALLA, LIENTRAP and several support agents), the LIFERSEY surveillance team and the LILYRIC Base. This Section has continued to use SCANTLING, primarily, to follow up LIMESSA leads obtained from LIFLATE and the photographic site bases; however, no positive results have been realized from his prodigious efforts except the collection of a considerable quantity of operational information. GERENDE performed at his principal photo requisition activities for the photographic site bases, LIENTRAP, LIFERSEY

Until 11 December 1953 handled the LIFEAT/GMORNING/GLIZEAT/ LIBFAT/ where applicable. The LILIPUTTY surveillance team has been used sparingly for proven investigations and routine team surveillance; however, a principal agent, CLACKETT, is currently being trained to head operations to assume the direction, control, staffing and development of the LUERSEY team. The project, LILIPUTTY, containing all the teams discussed in this report was presented to Headquarters on 3 October 1958 with requested project year approval. 1 December 1953 through 30 November 1959. An operational security outline of Raymond H. GERENDE's active base was forwarded to Headquarters as an attachment to HMMA-11363, 22 October 1958.

## ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - OLIVER C. SCANTLING SEGMENT

2. Agent Information - Oliver G. SCANTLING has continued to perform his assigned team in a crisis situation; moreover, SCANTLING's patience, constructive education, ideology and native ability for the pursuit of clandestine activities is make him one of the most valuable support assets available to the Mexico City Station. The fact is that SCANTLING has full time overt occupation as Chief Engineer and Production Manager for a local manufacturing company aside to his alleged potential as a KUBARK agent. On two occasions during the past month SCANTLING has indicated to his Case Officer that he would like to resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK operational activities; however, the Case Officer has discouraged him from doing this on the basis that he has more long-range potential when his overt occupation is legitimate. Of course, SCANTLING would be more reliable if he could work full time or be better staffed, but not sufficiently so to warrant his resignation from his overt job (at a tolerably adequate but not incredibly adequate salary), in excess of $800. The only obligation the Station has undertaken is that SCANTLING has evidenced to his present Case Officer a substantial delay in preparing written reports of investigations and other matters requiring reports for the file use; however, this task arises gradually and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to be factual, comprehensive and some will be promptly submitted.

3. Security Developments - SCANTLING is consistently under a considerable amount of duress and pressure when following up LIMESSA leads obtained from LIFLATE and the photographic site bases. Since time is always of the essence when a potential compromise is involved, SCANTLING frequently is directed to make approaches to individuals performing services for the LIRIL/RICK targets after routine, and sometimes costly, careful investigation; therefore, the possibility always exists of his compromise to an undesirable security incident. This arises strictly.

that detailed risk which both SCANILING and the States must take if penetration at a primary target is achieved, whether technically or by a secret mechanism in place. SCANILING's credits that he has not yet become involved in an incident where his actions has compromised him and/or alerted the target of KUARK's many activities as to being committed as a FORPAE operation stems directly from the LIPSTICK
unit. NIPSTONE is his true name at the time that he was leader of the team.
If placed in detention, however, this being uncovered with reference to SCANILING
and his part of improprieties by a local police service, SCANILING and his latter have been considered to watch closely for any sign of local police and other pressures to his activities.

Operational Sources and Effectiveness - Briefly discussed below are some important contributions to which SCANILING participated during the period covered by this report:

A. Juan *CASTRO (211-) -* SCANILING mentioned contacting CASTRO through December 1958 following the best later juncture of re-contacting the original LUMESA/ ACLIGHTING operation through CASTRO. As late as September 1956 possibilities
to re-contact, or improved at cause, that CASTRO would overthrow his work in the
LIPSTICK/LEADWICK office and that it might be possible to reinstall HALIEUTING.
While CASTRO, through SCANILING, was the principal source of this information, possibilities were also confirmed by LIDBACK. During July, August and September
1956 LIPSTICK had approximately fifty CIA contacts who were in contact with CASTRO.
In late September 1956 LIPSTICK indicated that the LIDBACK target was a retiring prominent
Cuban. This operation seems to find the best area around the target areas which CASTRO
would normally have been expected to do had he still been in the employ of the
LIPSTICK. This LIMITED and LIDCAT contacts confirm that the LIDBACK target had
become so violating the target assassination not did the target people attempt to go into contact with him. In view of this, SCANILING was instructed to cease all contact with CASTRO as of 1 November 1958.

B. Pablo *NEW Doana (211-) -* During the period covered by this report
SCANILING and two interviews with NON Sources, SCANILING's most recent
report was forwarded to headquarters as a reference to RAIMA-11143.1
in early September 1958. Unfortunately the situation has been identified more forces as the technically Service LIDBACK still send forces. SCANILING will continue his development of NON forces (phones see RAIMA-11711, 19 December 1958).

C. Camilo *VICALES (201-) -* SCANILING's activities in connection with this LUMESA/ACLIGHTING operation were also mentioned in RAIMA-11397, 22 October 1958, and prior there correspondence.

D. HIGHERIA GABELICH - This is the term that made the steel visit effort for the LIPSTICK initiative. SCANILING needs two visits to this
team's work, develop and succeeded to obstacles through information to make use of.

accurate drawing of the type Const installed at LIMERICK. This drawing was awarded to Headquarters via HAIA-11926, 21 January 1959.

E. Colog Report on West Germany embassy - During June, July and August 1958, KANVILO prepared a detailed casting report on the new LIMERICK embassy. SCANTLING's rapport eventually causes him to prepare accurate drawings and sketches from a multitude of data. Also, SCANTLING's gregarious nature permits him to visit the inside of such embassies, with an excuse to cover security, and retain minute details which later he converts to paper and energy to write a comprehensive floor plan and important construction data.

P. LIMERICK Construction - SCANTLING's long association with this target from the casting stage provides the front firm with an expert addicted to moments about LIMERICK construction from early stages, modified and can discuss casting, concrete, or file in Headquarters. All of the LIMERICK casting reports come as the product of SCANTLING's unusually military and knowledge. Military and Sanitation Officers about LIMERICK construction have been known to skip the first routine in the reporting period and then will continue to record worthwhile importance.

G. Routine Investigation and Surveillance on - Although the Section has several sources capable of performing investigations and surveillance, SCANTLING is still used in situations revealing the sources to deception and disruption. His activities in this to cover cities are non responsive to the Section. suffice it to state that he has contributed materially to the Section's information department of investigation through his transactions affecting SCANTLING's interview of Hans Frederick Kirockhoff (CIMA-6356) of LOMAY-HOWL, inferences to an example of SCANTLING's use on investigations (see HAIA-11749, 17 December 1958).

H. ESGM-15 - SCANTLING served as the contact with ESGM-15 during the latter's December 1958 trip to Mexico City. In this connection SCANTLING's export asked, offered to translate for him to the Section, SCANTLING never displays made a curiosity in operations as such as the ESGM-15 due; he accepts the information of information given and per instance his duties in a professional and accurate manager.

I. LIRAPIY/3 - SCANTLING has give the subunits native success connected with L/3. During M. KILLOO provides operational direction to L/3. During this reporting period, the Section has had hopes of SCANTLING taking over the operational supervision of L/3's activities. However, after a four-month KILLOO meeting with L/3, it was decided that he would be relieved for KILLOO to continue heading L/3. L/3's sexual personality and behavior indicated that he could best be directed by KILLOO to continue. Therefore, SCANTLING no longer assists KILLOO's operational meetings, although he does continue to handle L/3's administrative problems.

Mexico City in December 1958 and January 1959, it was considered appropriate for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LINTAP. Although this procedure denotes some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner in which the Station could maintain security with the three operations and avoid SCANTLING being connected with LIMITED, LICALLA and LINTAP for several years. In fact, he was at one time the agent in charge of these three operations.

2. Operational Methods Evolved During Test Period - The VIDALES operation required that ( ) could be maneuvered with the minimum foreknowledge with that of the station or Headquarters with the exception of the operators themselves. This can hardly be classified as a normal operational method, but it does serve to illustrate the enormous amount of facets that should be followed. The interface for LIMITED IV utilized the target's lodging, SCANTLING may monitor the localized of the target's lodging. At the station there is the opportunity to interpose to personally for SCANTLING's recruitment meeting on SCANTLING's cold approaches. (See [Illegible]-11363, 22 October 1958, and IM MW-7003, 21 November 1958, for additional details on this aspect).

3. In personal terms, one other contribution can be made about any target's associates whose technical and photographic capabilities seem poor, it is the ability of the Station to manipulate a claimant to extort considerably by accurate, immediately existing reports, SCANTLING, as previously mentioned, can maneuver assets for this type of support.

4. Administration - SCANTLING's contract expires on 15 February 1959. If SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3,600.00 U. S. for two years. The Station plans to raise his annual compensation to $4,000.00 U. S. after significant a definite effective problem exists.

5. Catwalk for Future Development - Station plans call for the continued use of SCANTLING in the same manner as he is presently being used. The Station will keep SCANTLING as an independent asset and, if beyond, resist the temptation to mobilize a principal agent in charge of numerous sub-agents. It is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asset that can be worthwhile to the Station for many years to come and that every effort should be made to protect his security and value to KUBA/KX.

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - RAYMOND R. GERENDE/SC GRANT

1. As per information - Aside from the agent information given in IBMA-11363, 22 October 1958, the only significant development was GERENDE's December 1958 marriage to a U. S., suspected girl of Dutch citizenship. The $-300.00 U. S. for the purchase of two plastic chastities as a wedding gift to GERENDE was designed to impress OFRENDE with the fact that KIBARSE thinks highly of him as an initial intelligence career. GERENDE is at an awkward stage in life where he is beginning to realize or pass that the future holds for him. In the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERENDE

9. Secretary Dave knows some - Again, this information on this subject was covered ads LIFFATHER/ARK/ORILLA was relieved of his LI/EAT/Cabin entitled, as to date as 10 December 1958. This, of course, was in the with recommendations contained in HqMA-1145 and represents a definite a earlier report shows.

This was from where the Orbase are concerned.), and it will cause any troop movements will be made warn Maria D. CLACKETT from the to and make sure that CHILORIDE of response utility for the LI/EASILY surveillance team.

10. Operational Income and Offshore Income - Briefly stressed below are the important operational activities in which CHLORIDE managed during the period covered by this report:

A. LIMITED - This base functioned smoothly, secretly and otherwise during the period July through December 1958. The base operation, LIEMPTY/6 has demonstrated his small competence and devotion to duty. In addition to the primary objective of taking photographs of individuals of interest, L/6 also prepared standard daily reports on the arrivals and departures of all suspect personnel weekly reports of work crew activities at the LIME RICK transit location, performed three man-on-man surveillance on of Mexicans working at LIME RICK to an effort to identify them by name and home address, and provided SCANTLING with information on Lime RICK construction. During this six-month period, LIEMPTY/6 took approximately 100 photographs from the LIMETRIC base.

B. LILYRIC - This base is operated by LIEMPTY/13 and 14, with LIEMPTY/ 12 serving as a transit house at this base and CERANIDE. LIEMPTY/14 does most of the photography and reporting for the base where LIEMPTY/13 has a regular bar. L/14 also sits on the premises answering overtime workers. L/14 also spends approximately six hours (0600-1400) each day to photography and the remainder of his time is spent preparing reports. The base prepares and compile important logs on certain large personality indexing data reports. Those reports are filled in to the report contains a 201 file and are made available to that the office are in analyzing a report's personality's pattern of daily activity. LILYRIC also prepared a weekly report on workers activities at the Club and prepare the license plate numbers of all vehicles either going or picking up individuals at LIMERICK, (Note: These licensed pace numbers are then charted out through LVIS 100%/ for the case to names and addresses 2 as case of (in insidious or in operations interest.) During CHALBONE'S recent change from Mexico City, CUSLER met directly with LIEMPTY/12. During this period approximately 72,000 photographs were taken from the LILYRIC base.

C. LICALLA - While LILYRIC and LIMITED are excellent bases for photographing individuals entering and leaving the LIME RICK transit location, the LICALLA base is the station's best source of photographs of LIMERICK.

comping area. LICALIA to be convinced that photographs can be made of competent
personnel in the garden area of LIBTECH. LISINTY/9 is the base operating
for LICALLA and in the Station's opinion performs his job in as neat acting
manager. As reported in LICALL-11705, LIMPITY/9 is the brother of former
L/9 (LPSTICK/el (this later LIP-TICK surveillance team member arrested to
June 1959). No reason to remove him, or indications of any troubling ones, have
resulted in this family relationships. This, certainly, is the major activity
problem faced by L/9 during this reporting period. L/9 and his L/s rally won
will have to overcome the LICALLA base for the period of time required in material
that L/9 are know that his efforts are spent comparing
the LICALLA bases and the times adjusting finances and every effort to
produce accurate items from L/9.
(See 8866(-)-2833, 28 Jan 1959, Data were received and experienced.)
Of course, during the remainder of
LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA reporting or photographs, in addition
to taking approximately 2,539 photos during this time period, in which a
TICALLA now also proved he cannot reports on L/M ELRICK review activity
These reverse influence which LICALLICE employees are not together each day,
not to accommodate to acting construction activities
and other matters into which report of significance to L/9.

D. LIENTRAP - LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhile Station menu
Approximately 1,400 clandestine photographs have been made of numerous
tangerine during this reporting period and LIENTRAP type activities will undoubtedly
remain one of the Sanction's best manipulative assets. As explained in the field
Project October, forwarded to headquarters on 8 October 1958, the first test to
of the minutes that the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as possible,
monthly for months have cleaned without receiving compensation industry to
replace the vehicle, The station will return to serve more time than in the end
operation

E. LUERSKY - This operation can be shown occurred as somewhat dormant
for the July - December 1958 period. Because of CHARENCE's other important
activities, he did not have the time to devote to the surveillance team,
tico, the Station considered that it would be increasingly security just a few for
to have CERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time that he was handling

activity, in addition is to bring to the home home, CERANDE who Treasurer then
the majority of the morning and Cuban to typeen, who performed

MEMORANDUM FOR: FI/4S - Projects rarch

SUBJECT: Wedding gift for Raymond R. JERKINS (ps),
Contract Agent

1. It is requested that the Mexico City Station be authorized to give Raymond H. JERKINS (ps), as a wedding gift, two airplane tourist class tickets from Mexico City to San Fransisco and Washington D.C. and return to Mexico City. Although this trip may appear to be a generous and unusual wedding gift, the Station considers it is more than justified in view of JERKINS outstanding performance of his duties for the Station and his future value as a principal agent. JERENDS has been working for the station since February 1955.

2. The Station estimates that the cost of the plane tickets will be $600.00. The MP.TICK Project, which covers JERENDS, can absorb this added expense.

## Review of Raymond H. GERENDE's Operations and Activities

ACTION REQUIRED:
Headquarters study and comments.

1.  The subject paper is attached. It is believed that Headquarters will have a clearer picture of what GERENDE is doing at the present time together with several informative facts concerning the security of GERENDE's operations. Also included in this paper are several recommendations which the Station proposes to implement through Project LIEMPTY. Obviously, some of the recommendations are goals to work for and, because of a lack of personnel and other valid reasons, cannot be immediately adopted.

2.  The attached paper should be read in conjunction with the new LIEMPTY field project outline, which was recently forwarded to Headquarters. Please note, however, that the old agent cryptonyms are used in this paper.

3.  The attachment has been read and approved by Matthew S. DINGLEY, who recruited this excellent agent (GERENDE) and was his Case Officer until GERENDE was recently assigned to Quinton N. Ousler.

4.  GERENDE is one of the most valuable assets of this Station. This review is considered to be a worthwhile exercise; but under the present operational pace and with present assets, security compartmentation, which is desirable, cannot be achieved. The main security precaution (viz getting GERENDE out of Mexico City and well hidden in case of an emergency) will constantly be kept in mind.

# OPERATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW OF RAYMOND H. GERENDE'S OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES

1.  **SITUATION**

As a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK flap, it was decided by the Chief of Station on 30 June 1958 that Quinton N. CUSLER would assume direct contact with several of Matthew S. DINGLEY'a agents, one of whom was Raymond H. GERENDE, After being introduced to GERENDE by DINGLEY on 1 July 1958, OUSLER assumed contact responsibilities with GERENDE on 2 July 1958. On 18 July 1958, the Chief of Station decided that OUSLER should be assigned permanent responsibility for the management and handling of GERENDE and GEKENDE's operations.

2.  **PURPOSE**

The purpose of this operational security review is threefold:

a. To identify possible security problems and conditions;
b. Te establish a framework for recommendations which will result in the Station's subintssion of a new support project (LIEMPTY) with Raymond H. GERENDE as a principal agent; and
c. To acquaint the new case officer with the operational problems and agent personnel with which he should have a comprehensive knowledge anal detailed understanding.

3.  **PRINCIPAL AGENT - Raymond H. GERENDE**

a. Background - GERENDE has been employed by KUBARK since 18 March 1955, which was just prior to his graduation from the Mexico City College. He is now only 24 years of age, but in the Station's opinion, is a mature, experienced and dedicated KUBARK contract agent. During the three and one-half years that he has been working for the Mexico City Station, GERENDE has participated in a varied assortment of support and intelligence operations. Initially, he was trained and used by Matthew S. DINGLEY as a member of the LIPSTICK survetilance team, In addition, to surveillance work, he was used as an investigator to collect operational data on persons and organizations of interest to the Station, He quickly demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was the leader of the LIPSTICK team, He has been used as a LIFEAT Base House operator

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 96

# SECRET

and processor of tapes; he has excelled in this type of work because of
his bi-lingual Spanish/English facility and, more importantly, due to
his diversified experience in clandestine operations which permits him
to spot operational leads much more readily than the average LIFEAT
monitor.

b. Duties GERENDE is currently serving as the principal agent
in charge of LIMITED, LICALIA, LIPSTICK Photo Truck, LIJERSEY
Surveillance Team and LILYRIC. In addition, he monitors and processes
the EGMORNING and Cuban Exiles LIFEAT taps. He also supervises
the photographic processing of LIPSTICK-38 (his brother-in-law) and the
translation work of LIPSTICK-40 (his stater). He maintains contact with
and provides administrative support to LIMITATIONS 5 and 6, L1000L-7
Base operators. Quite obviously GERENDE's many duties overlap the
bounds of several Station operations, namely LIPSTICK, LIJERSEY,
LIFEAT, LICOOL and several activities which are not listed under
formal projects such as BGMORNING. It is recognized by the Station
that it is not advisable to have one principal agent connected with as
many operations as is GERENDE. However, the present scarcity of
both staff and contract agents of the principal agent type necessitate
such efficiency measures, Every effort is being made to compartment
the various segments of GERENDE's operations and to decrease, and
to eliminate where possible, all lateral communications between
agents.

c. Security Problems - The most serious security situation
surrounding CERENDE and his many activities is the fact that
LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the LIPSTICK Team members arrested
in the June 1958 flap) know GERENDE by true name, and knew that he
also worked for KUBARK. In fact, LIPSTICK-30 is a close personal
friend of GERENDE's and was originally recommended for KUBARK
employment by GERENDE, The operational security hypothesis that
can be constructed from these existing acquaintances are too numerous
to list in this brief review; suffice to say that should GERENDE be
arrested by one of the local police agencies, most of the remaining
support assets would be destroyed or so seriously compromised that
the Station would indeed be foolish to continue using them. It is
appropriate to state here, however, that neither GERENDE nor the
Station believes that GERENDE has yet been named or otherwise
identified as a result of the LIPSTICK flap. It is granted though that
any future questions by one of the local police agencies to the compro-
mised LIPSTICKERS represents a continuing type of danger for GERENDE,
Based on the duties which GERENDE is currently performing, the readers
of this review can well imagine what the consequences to several operations

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 97

# SECRET

would be if GERENDE were arrested by one of the local police agencies and interrogated in detail. Also, the Station must forever be aware that the local police agencies are certainly capable, for only a few dollars, of selling information concerning KUBARK to the Soviets and/or Satellites.

d. Recommendations - It would be unwise to consider terminating GERENDE since he is a highly competent agent and since his termination would not eliminate the fact that he knows a great deal about the Station's support operations. He has been reminded several times, and the Case Officer will continue to remind him, that his tradecraft professionalism must improve and stay ahead of the tecreasing sophistication of the local police agencies and opposition services operating in Mexico.

It is the opinion of the Station that GERENDE should continue to be used in about the same manner that he is presently being used. It would be advisable, however, to separate him from the two LIFEAT functions he là currently handling, BGMORNING and the Cuban Exile taps. This is suggested not only because of the possible future security ramifications, but also because GERENDE does not have time to run properly his support mechanism and to monitor taps seven days a week,

To provide for a situation whereby one of the local police agencies becomes aware of GERENDE's legal activities and assuming that either GERENDE or the Station learns of this before the local police agency can take positive action, it is imperative that a warning system of communications be established to facilitate GERENDE's removal from Mexico. Arrangements such as those used for Wilfred O. CLOWER could be set up or local arrangements could be made with ODUNIT or ODOATH for a more expedirious exit from Mexico. The Case Officer will develop this plan in detail.

4. OPERATIONS

a. Limited

(1) Target - Stationary photographic surveillance of persons entering and leaving the LIMERICK installation,

(2) Personnel - LIPSTICK-14 is the agent in charge of the LIMITED Base. According to GERENDE, LIPSTICK-14 is conscientious, security minded, speaks no English, and on occasion is a bit over confident. He performs his operational duties competently and with discretion, In addition to his photographic duries, he is also used occasionally as a one-man

# SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

# SECRET

foot surveillance to follow individuals leaving the LIMERICK
Installation, LIPSTICK-14 receives a monthly salary of $1,800.00
(MN) and free rent and utilities at the LIMITED Base. His wife
(LIPSTICK-27) and son (LIPSTICK-28) live with him at the LIMITED
Ваве,

LIPSTICK-28 until 15 July 1958 assisted his father with photo-
graphic work at the LIMITED Base, However, on the above
date he decided to resign from his LIMITED job and, strange
as it may seem, to devote full time to working on a chicken
farm, LIPSTICK-28 made this decision on his own and against
the wishes of his father. He will continue to live at the
LIMITED Base and it is believed that no security problems will
result, since any security difficulties could adversely affect
his mother and father. Although LIPSTICK-28 has been
terminated and a termination report forwarded to Headquarters,
it is suggested that we ma intain his operational approval since
he continues to live in the LIMITED Base.

(3) Communications - At the present time GERENDE meets
with LIPSTICK-14 three times a week at contact points away from
the Base. They have seven separate contact points which are
used for their meetings, Usually the place of contact is pre-
arranged at the previous meeting; however, a rapid means of
communication exists whereby GERENDE telephones LIPSTICK-14
and through a pre-arranged open code, utilizing insurance
policy numbers, sets the time and place of contact, LIPSTICK-14's
overt occupation is that of an insurance salesman and adjuster;
consequently, there is a cover basis for such a telephonic
conversation, A reserve system of communication with LIPSTICK-14
has not yet been arranged, GERENDE has been instructed to do
this as soon as possible, thereby giving the Station a means to
contact LIPSTICK-14 directly should the need ever arise.

(4) Security- Excluding KUBARK staff personnel, the LIMITED
Base is known to LIPSTICKS-2, 14, 27 and 28 and to Oliver
G. SCANTLING and Raymond H. GERENDE and possibly to
LIPSTICK-12 (CERENDE's opinion). Since LIPSTICK-14 has
known LIMEWATER (LIFEAT Project) for many years and since
LIMEWATER is LIPSTICK-2's brother, it is important to recognize
that the desirable degree of compartmentation between LIPSTICK/
LIMITED and LIFEAT probably does not exist. Although LIMEWATER
must be aware of LIPSTICK-14's and 2's PRPRIME employment,
it has not been possible to ascertain the extent of LIMEWATER'S
knowledge about their specific activities, and vice versa, LIPSTICK-14

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 99

SECRET

worked with James O. AYCALL (LIMESTONE) during WW-II; however, he claims that the only members of AYCALL's family that he ever met was AYCALL's "alieged wife," Since she saw him only one time many years ago, LIPSTICK-14 does not believe that she would recognize him now.

Neither GERENDE nor LIPSTICK-14 are aware that KUBARK owns the LIMITED Base House. The extent of their knowledge is that LIMOUSINE is the owner and we simply rent from him,

(5) Recommendations - It is recommended that GERENDE continue to meet with LIPSTICK-14 and to supervise his operation. In this connection, GERENDE has been instructed to reorganize his existing communications arrangements with LIPSTICK-14 to include a new regular system, a rapid non-scheduled system and a reserve system. Also, GERENDE is to review with LIPSTICK-14 their cover reasons for mecting and knowing each other and to be prepared to use this cover story should they ever be apprehended together.

LIPSTICK-14 was instructed on 8 August 1958 to cease all social and business contact with LIPSTICK-2. Oliver G. SCANTLING, who has previously handled LIPSTICK-14 and sees him occasionally even now, has been directed to cease all contact with the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14 except when approved by the Case Officer, (NOTE: It is necessary at times for SCANTLING to debrief LIPSTICK-14 for LIMESA leads).

b. LILYRIC

(1) Target - Stationary photographic surveillance of persons entering and leaving the LIMERICK installations,

(2) Personnel - LIJERSEY-5 is personnel manager of a Mexican affiliate of a large PBPRIME company. In addition to serving as a spotter for potential surveillance team members, he also serves as the cutout for the LILYRIC Base, GERENDE manages and directs the LILYRIC Base through LIJERSEY-5. LIJERSEY-5 maintains direct contact with LIJERSEY-2, the Base House operator, and his wife, LIJERSEY-12, who does most of the photographic work, LIJERSEY-5 is a PBPRIME citizen, He is paid a monthly salary of $1,000.00 (MN).

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 100

SECRET

LIJERSEY-2 is the LILYRIC Base operator. He is a Captain in the Mexican Army Reserve and is also employed by Colgate-Palmolive Peet Company as an industrial engineer. He receives a monthly salary of $1,000.00 (MN) and he and his wife live rent and utilites free in the ILILYRIC Base.

LIJERSEY-12 is the wife of LIJERSEY-2. She does most of the photographic and reporting work at the LILYRIC Base and has proven herself to be a capable and worthwhile asset. It has been necessary for her to become proficient in the LILYRIC work since her husband works at his regular job during the day. She receives a monthly salary of $800.00 (MN).

(3) Communications - GERENDE contacts LIJERSEY-5 twice weekly at prearranged contact points during the late afternoon hours, LIJERSEY-5 contacts LIJERSEY-2 two to three times weekly at prearranged car contact points and receives the "take" from the LILYRIC Base. On occasion GERENDE has contacted LIJERSEY-2 directly, but this procedure is used only when LIJERSEY-5 is out of town or otherwise not available, GERENDE does not know LIJERSEY-12 or vice versa. No reserve system of communications exists whereby a Station officer could contact LIJERSEY-2 directly should the need arise; however, GERENDE has been instructed to set up such a system of communications. The same will be done with LIJERSEY-5, although he is known to several Station officers and little difficulty would be experienced in contacting him directly.

(4) Security - The security of the LILLYRIC Base appears, at least on paper, to be in better shape than the Limited or LICALLA Bases, Insofar as the Case Officer has been able to determine, the only indigenous agents aware of the LILYRIC Base are GERENDE, LIJERSEYS 2, 5 and 12, and LIPSTICKS 38 and 40, and all of these individuals have a close connection with the operation of the Ease. The only tie-in the LILYRIC Base has with the LIPSTICK operations is through GERENDE.

(5) Recommendations - GERENDE has been instructed to change his meeting plans with LIJERSEY-5 and to review the communications set-up between LIJERSEY-5 and LIJERSEY-2 (L-5 and L-2 are long-time friends and, consequently, the cover problem is minimized). A staggered schedule of coverage of the LIMERICK target between LILYRIC and LIMITED was initiated on 18 August 1958. Although the operators of these two bases are unaware of the existence of the other, a suitable cover story has been worked out to satisfy any

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 101

SECRET

curiosity that LIPSTICK-14 and LIJERSEYS-2 and 12 may have. This procedure is believed destrable due to the confining nature of the photographic tasks and the lack of additional personnel to assist at each of the bases. Also, this staggered schedule of coverage should reduce some of the duplication presently coming in from the two bases,

c. LICALLA

(1) Target - Stationary photograp hic surveillance of persons and activities in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation.

(2) Personnel - LIPSTICK-39, his wife and three small children live at die LICALLA Base. He is an accountant for a local bus line and works at his cover job in the evenings. LIPSTICK-39 does an excellent and conscientious job of photographic coverage at the LICALLA Base, In addition to the photos he takes, he writes a narrative description of the events which take place in the target's garden area. He receives a monthly salary of $2,000.00 (MN) and free rent at the LICALLA Base,

(3) Communications - GERENDE meets LIPSTICK-39 twice weekly, usually on Tuesdays and Thuradays. They have four contact points, one of which is selected at each meeting for use for the next meeting. In the event that contact is not established, GERENDE has the initiative in contacting LIPSTICK-39 by phoning him at the bus line office during the evenings. Then, by prearranged open code, a meeting site and time are agreed on, Since Oliver G. SCANTLING is also acquainted with LIPSTICK-39, it would be possible to contact him through SCANTLING should something happen to GERENDE. However, to facilitate proper and secure communications procedures, GERENDE has been directed to establish a reserve system of communications with Lipstick-39, using the customary oral and physical bonafides.

(4) Security - The most serious security problem concerning LICALLA is the fact that LIPSTICK-39 is the brother of LIPSTICK-47 (the first agent arrested by the local police agency during the recent LIPSTICKflap). Although it is generally believed by Station officers that LIPSTICK-39's name was not mentioned by LIPSTICK-47 nor that any indication was given concerning LIPSTICK-39's job, it must be understood that should the local police agency decide later to interrogate LIPSTICK-47, the probability exists of compromising LIPSTICK-39 and LICALLA. The Station sees no way to overcome this possibility.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 102

# SECRET

It is important to note here that LICALLA occupies one of the four LIMUST properties. While it is believed that LIPSTICK-39 does not know that KUBARK owns the Base or has anything to do with the other three houses, it is entirely conceivable that should one of the local police agencies or the LIMERICK personnel become aware of LICALLA activities, they could very easily arrive at some logical conclusions about all of the LIMUST property. This would be detrimental, if not fatal, to our aims. However, another Station viewpoint on this same problem is that if compromised, LICALLA would divert suspicion from, rather than to, LIMUST. Should one of the local police agencies begin an investigation which might involve LIMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be sacrificed to protect the LIMUST Base. These possibilities become somewhat theoretical and perhaps impractical due to the lack of predictibility of the local police agencies, but nevertheless must be weighed one against the other.

In view of the apparent importance of the LIMESA/LIMUST operation a lot of thought and discussion have transpired at the Station about continuing the LICALLA operation in us present location or suspending it for the immediate future and attempting to find another suitable location away from the LIMUST property. A sound argument can be made for terminating the base since such an alternative might have the effect of limiting any knowledge LIPSTICK-39 may have about the LIMESA/LIMUST Installation. However, the termination of a productive base such as LICALLA would require an explanation to LIPSTICK-39 which could not help bur leave him a bit suspicious. For Headquarters information, the local rental laws are such that LIPSTICK-39 would not be able to comprehend why we did not insist on him maintaining "squatters rights" (as stated previously, LIPSTICK-39 apparently does not know that we own LICALLA or even have an interest in any of the other LIMUST properties, which can easily be done in Mexico. Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALLA might cause more of a security problem with LIPSTICK-39 than permitting LICALLA to operate as it is now. Another possibility would be terminating LIPSTICK-39 and putting another agert in the present LICALLA Base, If this measure were followed, it would not eliminate the fact that LIPSTICK-39, even if terminated, would still know of the existance of the present LICALLA Base. Still another possibility would be to terminate LIPSTICK-39 and the LICALLA Base; however, since LICALLA and the other LIMUST properties are ostensibly owned by one man, LIMOUSINE, suspicions and investigations could still lead to LIMUST.

(5) Recommendations - The Station is inclined not to "rock the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 103

SECRET

boat" at this stage of the game and suggests that we maintain LICALLA at its present location and with its present operator, LIPSTICK-39. One alternative appears to be about cs good as another in this case, and it is an acknowledged fact that LICALLA, at its present location, is a worthwhile and productive asset. Headquarters ideas and comments on the LICALLA Base would be appreciated.

At the present time it is planned to move LIPSTICK-39 and family to a furnished apartment when the time comes to remodel the LICALLA Base. After completion of the remodeling, LIPSTICK-39 and family will return to the present LICALLA Base.

d. PHOTO TRUCK

(1) *Target* - Investigative asset used for taking curreptitious photographs of persons, places and things that are from time to time of interest to the Station and Headquarters.

(2) *Personnel* - LIPSTICK-2, as indicated by the low numerical designation of his cryptonym, has been employed by KUBARK for several years. At the present time LIPSTICK-2 is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the photographic surveillance truck. He is also used occasionally to spot and rent operational apartments. In the past, LIPSTICK-2 has served as team leader of a low level surveillance team (which was compromised and subsequently disbanded), as a LIFEAT line inspector (when he was not busy with the photo truck), and as a static surveillance man (I.e., used as an outside sentry during the March 1958 entry of the LIMUST Base by KUTUBE/D, KURIOT and KUCLUB technicians, (NOTE: LIPSTICK-2 was assigned the task of watching the entire area during the day for any unusual activity on the part of target personnel. He was not told that he was to watch a specific house. He was dismissed from his static surveillance before dusk and the Headquarters technicians did not enter LIMUST until after 2030 hours.) LIPSTICK-2 is the brother of LIMEWATER (LIFEAT Project) and LIPSTICK-34 (LIPSTICK Surveillance team member) is LIPSTICK-2's wife's nephew. LIPSTICK-2's cover is buying and selling cars; however, about the only bustness he has in this connection is when he buys and sells cars for KUBARK. His cover is quite weak. He receives a monthly salary of $3,200.00 (MN) plus $600.00 (MN) per month for the use of his personal car.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

# SECRET

LIPSTICK-24 does not know GERENDE and, presumably, knows only LIPSTICK-2, with whom he works on the photo truck. His cover is as a salesman of electrical appliances; however, he does not pursue his cover job to the desirable extent, LIPSTICK-24 was recruited by LIPSTICK-2 about one year ago and is currently receiving a salary of $1,000.00 (MN) per month, Since he has now worked a year for the Station, and performed satisfactorily, his salary should be ratsed to $1,200.00 (MN) per month (LIEMPTY will provide for this increaве).

(3) Communications - GERENDE meets LIPSTICK-2 two to three times a week, These meetings are arranged by phone and take place at previously selected contact points which can be referred to in telephonic conversations by Innocent sounding code names. LIPSTICK-2 also knows GERENDE's true name, where he lives, and his phone number. In the past he has had occasion to telephone GERENDE at the latter's home. LIPSTICK-2 knows DINGLEY, and could, in an emergency situation, contact DINGLEY. However, GERENDE has been instructed to arrange a complete communica- ttons plan with LIPSTICK-2, including a reserve means of contact. For security reasons, GERENDE has been instructed to inform LIPSTICK-2 that his only contact is with GERENDE and that in the future he is not to contact anyone else in the organization without GERENDE's permission. Also, that should contact with GERENDE be disrupted, he is to await for the higher echelon to establish contact with him (all agents under GERENDE are being so instructed). This is particularly important in the case of ipstick-2, since he has by-passed GERENDE in two or three Instances in the past.

(4) Security - Probably the most serious security situation involving the photo truck, LIPSTICK-2 and Lipstick-24 is the basic knowledge of the LIPSTICK surveillance team that such an asset exists, even to the point that one of the team members (LIPSTICK-34) is the listed owner of the photo truck. The personal knowledge of LIPSTICK-2 about the LIFEAT operation also represents a security hazard of the first class. For example, if LIPSTICK-2 were compromised and arrested as a result of his activities, there is a possibility that he could compromise his brother, LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE and our interest in the highly sensitive LIMESA/LIMUST operation, (NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and the former LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICK-2 have been reminded on several occasions during the past few years that they were not to discuss any aspect of their operations with each other. Also, LIPSTICK-2, to the best of the Station's

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

# SECRET

knowledge, does not know the location of any of the LIFEAT
Baso houses).

A now truck should be purchased as soon as possible to replice
the present truck. The new truck should be purchased in an
assumed name and vehicle papers should list an untraceable
address, LIPSTICK-2 has already been informed that he is to
have no contact with LIPSTICK-14 or any other operational
personnel he may know except, of course, LIPSTICK-24,
with whom he works, and GERENDE, who supervises his
activities, In addition to the above, the Station should begin
thinking about a replacement agent for LIPSTICK-2 and every
effort should be made to set up an independent and compartmented
photo truck operation, This would permit the eventual termination
of LIPSTICK-2, after we have given him several months to
reduce lits knowledge of current operations.

d. LIJERSEY

(1) Target - Foot surveillance and investigative support of
other Station operations,

(2) Personnel - LIJERSEY-4 ts of a low social class and
lives with his mother in a slum area of Mexico City. He ta
the sole support for his mother and several younger brothers
and sisters. He is described by GERENDE as having a lot of
ambition and a strong desire to improve his standard of living
and position in life, The Station has found him to be a good
observer and, consequently, adequate for static surveillance
work. Although he now has his drivers license, he is not a
capable driver and probably will never develop into one,
GERENDE has been encouraging LIJERSEY-4 to obtain employment
as a salesman to supplement his KUBARK income of $1,000.00
(MN) and to establish himself in a cover job, However, LIJERSEY-4
has not yet obtained such employment. It is the Station's
opinion that LIJERSEY-4 is definitely an asset of limited value
and will never develop into the high-calibre surveillance asset
which the Station really needs.

LIJERSEY-8's situation is about the same as LIJERSEY-4's.
He lives with his family and is currently taking highschool
courses (LIJERSEY-4 is doing the same). He is not an imaginative
talker and has difficulty making up cover stories and spur-of-the-
moment excuses and explanations the vital qualifications for a
good surveillance man. He is the best driver of the three LIJERSEY


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

# SECRET

team members and with more practice will probably develop into a capable and dependable driver. LIJERSEY-8 has recently shown a commendable amount of initiative where his awer situation is concerned. He has obtained a job as a commission salesman for UNDERWOOD typewriters and, according to GERENDE, is making a substantial amount of "pin" money. However, as in the case of LIJERSEY-4, LIJERSEY-8 is at best an asset of only limited value. LIJERSEY-8 also receives a salary of $1,000.00 (MN) per month.

LIJERSEY-13 does not know LIJERSEYS-4 and 8 and vice versa. LIJERSEY-13 is better dressed than the other two team members and can pass as a better educated and more socially flexible Individual, He speaks fairly good English. He performs pretext Investigation assignments with facility and imagination and is adept at making up cover stories, In brief, he makes a good Impression on the people he interviews, He is not a good driver and is too nervous to develop into one. His salary is $1,000,00 (MN) per month.

(3) Communications - GERENDE has daily contact arrangements with the three LIJERSEYS. Prearranged meeting places are used on designated days of each week and the LIJERSEYS are instructed to go to each meeting. They have standing instructions to continue going to their meeting sites for two weeks; if they have not been contacted during that period of time, they can discontinue their communications plan and await contact by GERENDE or another appropriately selected agent at their respective homes. None of the LIJERSEYS have home telephones; hence, it is impossible to arrange any type of communications using this means, GERENDE is currently in the process of setting up new and more complete communications arrangements with the three LIJERSEYS.

(4) Securiry - Insofar as knowledge of other operations, personnel and assets is concerned, the LIJERSEYS appear to have the best security of any of the operations handled by GERENDE. New communications plans with the LIJERSEYS will do much toward increasing security and ability to meet contingencies. GERENDE Wl be instructed to give refresher training to all three LIJERSEYS in operational security, cover and communications. The major danger existing with the LIJERSEY team, and with any surveillance team, is the possibility of compromise and arrest by one of the local police agencies. Should this happen, GERENDE and his other operations would be placed in considerable danger.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

# SECRET

For this reason, it is not advisable to have GERENDE connected with a surveillance team and also contacting and directing the sensitive photo base houses. Therefore, until such time as a suitable asset can be developed or acquired to take over the LIJERSEY team, their actual surveillance assignments will be kept at the mtaimum,

(5) Recommendations - It is suggested that the LIJERSEY framework be used for the recruitment ci at least three competent and higher class local nationals for use on surveillance assignments, After the recruitment of such individuals, it may be suggested that LIJERSEYS-4 and 8 be terminated, LIJERSEY-13 should remain as an independent investigative asset to conduct "credit" and other type of inquiries which he can do without help from other agents. LIJERSEY-5 has already been asked to spot prospective candidates of a higher social standing for use on a new surveillance team; however, even under optimum conditions, one and a half years will be required to get such a team functioning. In order to recruit the type of team member that will be most worthwhile to the Station, we must plan to pay a minimum starting salary of $1,600.00 (MN) per month. The cost of living in Mexico is continually on the rise and where $1,000.00 (MN) was a good salary one to two years ago, it really is not adequate today.

LIFEAT

(1) Target - Conversations coming from two telephone taps, BGMORNING and Cuban exiles.

(2) Personnel - GERENDE lives in the apartment where these two lines are maintained, He personally processes the take from the lines and passes it to OUSLER for Station dissemination to Robert B. RIGGS (BGMORNING) and Calude K. Shyrock (Cubans). GERENDE, in accordance with LIFEAT procedures, is supposed to remain in this apartment seven days a week, However, this is impossible due to his other operational assignments and activities,

(3) Communications - GERENDE meets daily with OUSLER to pass the LIFEAT "take" and to discuss other operational matters.

(4) Security - It is not a good security practice to have a LIFEAT montior working on anything except LIFEAT. Other duties, which GERENDE certainly has, limit one's capability for maimaining the required security alertness for telephone

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

SECRET

repairmen and others who might accidentally discover one of our LIFEAT taps. Also, should GERENDI be compromised through any of his other operations, it is conceivable that the EGMORNING and Cuban Exiles LIFEAT taps would be discovered by one of the local police agencies.

(5) Recommendations - It is suggested that a replacement be found as soon as possible to relieve GERENDE of his present LIFEAT duries.

LICOOL-7

(1) Target - A planned technical installation against a person of interest to the Station and to Headquarters.

(2) Personnel - LIMITATION-5 and his wife, LIMITATION-6, are the LICL-7 Base House operators, LIMITATION-5 has been with KUBARK for several years. He was at one time the LIAXIOM Base House operator. He presently works for the DuPont Company. He dresses well, speaks some English and could be described as belonging to the rising middle class of Mexicans. His wife can do photographic work and has had previous experiance with KUBARK in the dispatching of car surveillances by radio, LIMITATIONS-5 and 6 are not participating in any active work perkling the installation of L1000L-7 in their apartment. LIMITATION-5 receives a monthly salary of $000.00 (MN) and LIMITATION-6 receives $400.00 (MN) monthly.

(3) Communications - A complete communications plan does not exist between GERENDE and LIMITATION-5. At the present time it is only necessary for GERENDE to see LIMITATION-5 on pay day and when Harvey C. MULFORD destres to visit the apartment for technical surveys and other work. Therefore, GERENDE and LIMITATION-5 utilize an open code telephonic means of getting together. So far, this has worked quite well, but it will be necessary later to set up a more sophisticated commmmications system.

(4) Security - The operational aspects of LICOOL-7 are under the jurisdiction of Matthew S. DINGLEY; therefore, the author of this report is not familiar with the security ramifications, if any, surrounding this technical installation and the agents operating it.

(5) Recommendations - None.

SECRET

h. MISCELLANEOUS

Also on the payroll as worthwhile assets are GERENDE's brother-in-law, LIPSTICK-38, and his sister, LIPSTICK-40. GERENDE and LIPSTICK-38 process and print all the LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and truck photos. LIPSTICK-40 does non-sensitive translation work for the Station, Both LIPSTICKS-38 and 40 are handled by GERENDE. They do not have contact with other agents or with station officers, LIPSTICK-38 receives a monthly salary of $1,000,00 (MN). LIPSTICK-40 receives the equivalent or $1,75 U. S. in pesos per hour for her work,

Although it is not adviseable from the security point of view to have any Indigenous agent aware of all three of our LIMERICK photographic bases and the photo truck, the load on the Station photographer several months ago resulted in just such a solution to the problem, Previously, GERENDE and LIPSTICK-38 had processed only the photographs from LIMITED, LILYRIC and the truck,

5. RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations have been included in several sections of this paper, Those same recommendations, excepting those which have already been carried out or are in the process of implementation, are listed below in a composite form to facilitate the readers' overall comprehension.

a. Continue the reorganization of communication arrangements with all agents,

b. Relieve GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties (B GMORNING and Cuban Exiles taps) as soon as possible.

c. Continue to use GERENDE for the time being as the principal agent in charge of LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA, the Photo Truck, LIJERSEY, LIMITATIONS-5 and 6, and LIPSTICKS 38 and 40.

d. Arrange a warning system of communications for removing GERENDE to PBPRIME should he be compromised to one of the local police agencies,

e. Purchase a new photo truck for use by LIPSTICKS 2 and 24.

f. Begin planning for a compartmented photo truck operation which will later permit termination of LIPSTICK-2,

g. Spot and recruit at least three indigenous agents from the middle class social level to form the nucleus of a new LIJERSEY

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

SECRET

surveillance team.

h. Eventually separate GERENDE from elther LIJERSEY surveillance team duties or the three photographic base houses, preferably the former. The two types of activities are not compatible with each other and should not be handled by the same principal agent.

l. Implied, but not specifically stated elsewhere in this paper, is the suggestion that GERENDE be given a "cooling off' and training period of two to three months in PUPRIME. Of course, this will not be possible until other assets are developed to take over GERENDE's present duntes. After his return from PBPRIME, GERENDE could be used to develop new support assets which would be completely compartmented from all of his previous operations, personnel and activities.

6. CONCLUSIONS

It would take several weeks of uninterrupted study of files to write a really comprehensive security review of GERENDE's operations and activities, However, based on the facts contained in this paper, it is the Station's opinion that GERENDE probably is not now known to the local police agencies as a KUBARK or FBPRIME agent. It is believed that GERENDE could be identified by the local police agencies at any time they choose to interrogate LIPSTICKS-12 and 30 in detail or when one of the other agent assets formerly or currently associated with GERENDE is compromised, Furthermore, if GERENDE is arrested, he could compromise most of the Station's support assets, plus the BGMORNING and Cuban Exiles portions of LIFEAT.

Given several months time, the slow process of compartmentarion can be introduced into GERENDE's operations. Such compartmentation, however, will never reach the truly desirable point, but some improvement over the existing situation can be made, If GERENDE can emerge basically unscathed from the current incidents, then KUBARK will have an extremely valuable long-range support asset.

1. Referencea outlined the arrest of LIPSTICK-47, the subsequent arrests of LIPSTICK-12 and 30, their interrugation by the Mexican Secret Service and their eventual release from prison. References truly portrayed the incident with the following exceptions:

a. None of the arrested men was tortured.

b. LIPSTICK-45 was never arrested.

c. Only LIPSTICK 12, 30 and 47 vare arrested,

d. LIPSTICK-29 was not taken from his home by force.. In fact he was never arrested.

2. While under detention the arrested men told the story as it appears in Attachment A which, was written by LIPSTICK-30. It is not believed that the men said anything more because:

a. The substance of the story vas told to Station Mexico identically via three (3) seperate and epartmented sources, i.e. from the arrested man, from the attorney, Raul F. CaMiCHA, and from the Counselor of Canadian Embassy, Sidney

b. Each operation mentioned in Attachment A, which was susceptible to a check by the Secret Service, vas investigated by them. However, no operation ort mentioned in Attachment A vas investigated by the Secret Service.

c. LIPSTICK-47, who had only been with the team about one and a half months and who did most of the talking, did not know any information other than that in Attachment A.

d. LIPSTICK-12 and 30, who knew considerably more about our operations, are both made of sterner stuff than LIPSTICK-47 sand have keener minds.

e. The "ring of truth" that Attachment A has. It is not believed that the Secret Service is sufficiently sophisticated to concoct such a believable story.

f. The combined opinion of every Case Officer who has known LIPSTICK-12 and 30 that they did not reveal any information other than that contained in Attach-ment A.

g. On 10 July 1953 LIPSTICK-12 and 30 were examined by Martin F. REMALEY on ICYLUTTER. REMALEY vas satisfied that the results of this examination completely exonerated LIPSTICK-12 sed 30 from say cooperation with the Mexican Police. The results of those tests are attached as Attachment B.

3. In order to assess what possible damage might have been done to Station Mexico's operations if the arrested men had told the Secret Service everything they knew, there follows a list of those operations known to the arrested men:

a. LIPSTICK-47 did not know anything more than he told the Secret Service as outlined in Attachment A.

(5) He knows all of the present LIPSTICK team and LIPSTICK-12

(6) Through surveillance, he has learned of all the operations as listed in the case of LIPSTICK.

4. At the present time the LIPSTICK team is inoperative. The team members are working at their various cover jobs and writing a critique on the surveillance techniques they used which caused these to be arrested.

Matthew S. DINGLEY has stopped all sensitive contacts and turned them over to Quinton K. OWSLEY as a precautionary measure should WHALEY be under surveillance. DINGLEY continues to see LIPSTICK-30 who now administers the team, and DINGLEY also continues to be the case officer for LIVERPOOL.

LIPSTICK-47 has been fired and the LIPSTICK officers have been ousted and the furniture stored in a public warehouse. With the unofficial cooperation of Nogales and Monterrey Bases, Wilfred G. GANIER was smuggled out of Mexico.

5. Future planning for the LIPSTICK team will depend upon the results of operational tests and additional deductive reassessment based upon the actions of the team and the results obtained. General Miguel NAJAR Simoeti, Chief of the Mexico Secret Service, has agreed to protect the team fully and assume responsibility for their actions for the sum of $250.00 U.S. per month. HOLINAR has also promised to issue the team credentials from the Secret Service, or some other official investigative agency, after the presidential inauguration in November of 1958. The future of the LIPSTICK team will depend upon the following factors:

a. It is not believed that the Secret Service demanded, nor even suggested, that the team report future activities to the Secret Service. (Test leads, susceptible of checking, will be given to the LIPSTICK team to determine if they are being reported to the Secret Service)...

b. Degree of access to Secret Service files given to the LIPSTICK team.

c. Effectiveness of General MILIAN's protection.

7. Station Mexico recommends that the LIPSTICK team be allowed to continue operations for a period of three months at which time a reassessment will be made based upon the evidence accumulated over that period of time. The reassessment will be concerned mainly with whether or not the team is really under the control of the Secret Service and the degree of success of their "penetration" of the Secret Service.

MEMORANDUM FOR: WH/III/Mexico

SUBJECT: Raymond H. GERENDE

REFERENCE: HWM-A-11368

1. This dispatch represents the type of operational reporting we need. I think any answer to the Station should lead off with an expression of appreciation for a good job. Maybe it will encourage them to write more of this type.

2. GERENDE is very exposed, and should be taken off some of his jobs at once. Specifically, my ideas are as follows:

3. Re para. 3 a, agent is very capable and should be retained if secure means can be found. Getting rid of him would not solve the problem. As long as he is in Mexico he is vulnerable. Some thought should be given to how he would be supported in the event of arrest. Personally, I believe the Station would do better to sacrifice a case officer than permit things to drag on to the point where GERENDE might tell all to the police.

Recommendations:

a. GERENDE be briefed so as to be ever ready with an innocuous story to tell the police in the event of arrest.

b. GERENDE be told to contact one of already blown Station officers like HAZLETT in the event of arrest and that the Station officer be ready to appear personally at police station to free GERENDE. If the case officer named for this city and GERENDE both know the innocuous cover story, there should be little problem. I have done it myself. A good cover story is "looking for draft dodgers" or some such tale which does not have implications of working against Mexican citizens.

c. That if not allowed to communicate directly GERENDE should tell the senior officer present at police station that he works on (cover story) for HAZLETT and insists HAZLETT be sent for.

d. That a second blown case officer's name be given as an alternate for HAZLETT, who is often out of town and unavailable.

e. That GERENDE be taken off LIFEAT at once and all
suspicious audio equipment be removed from his home or offices.
At present, LIFEAT is the only illegal activity being engaged
in by GERENDE; if he is made merely in connection with his
physical surveillance activities he is not likely to be hurt
by the Mexicans.

f. Concur preparations should be made to hide out GERENDE
if it is known he is to be arrested.

4. Re para. 4 a, GERENDE's participation in LIMITED is O. K.
   I believe no law is being broken. However, LIMITED is probably blown
   to the Soviets. Hermis the more real danger. Station should find out
   who is the registered owner of the phone at LIMITED. Prior to leaving
   Mexico I noted to MAHONEY it was still held in the name of LIMESTONE-3
   (now fired and hence a possible threat).

5. Re para. 4 b: This is the same situation as LIMITED but not
   so likely blown to the Soviets. There is no reason why GERENDE should
   not continue this work.

6. Re para. 4 c, LICALLA is a very special problem and should
   be taken up at once with Headquarters elements working on LIMESA/LIMUST.
   I thought LICALLA had been cancelled out when LIMESA began to shape up.
   I consider it a danger to LIMESA. Has LICALLA produced anything of
   value? I think we could vacate this in such a way that the agents in
   LICALLA would have no cause to be suspicious. (Put an obvious tail on
   the agent, scare him off, etc. This would throw off the Mexican police,
   too, in the event they are already wise to LICALLA through LIPSTICK 47.
   We could pretend to believe the Soviets ran the tail and the game is up.)

Recommendation: Get rid of LICALLA unless very productive. Better
do this before the remodeling begins.

7. Re para 4 d, photo truck. LIPSTICK-2 does know of the locations
   of some of the basehouses on LIFEAT since he was a line inspector.

Recommendations:

a. New compartmented truck should be set up. Don't use false
names and addresses. It could result in great harm.

b. LIPSTICK-2 be sent off to some small town as "resident
agent" for general work and to get him out of the area.

8. Re para. Le. I have no particular thoughts on LIJERSEY but think it consistent for GERENDE to handle it.

9. Re para. 4 f: GERENDE should be taken off LIFEAT at once, even if it means losing lines. As of March this year the Station had enough agent personnel to handle bases for 24 lines. They should be able to fill the gap even though LIMESTONE-3 and his tribe ware fired. Only 12 lines are now being handled (latest report). The way CERENDE is handling his LIFEAT work seems to be treaking all the rules wo set up inseven years of experience.

10. Re para. 4 g, LICOOL-7. I see no harm in GPP2NDE's hamiling the operational aspect of this case. But through ATIC-5 the police could get bace to LIMITATION and the rain LIRICK tap, that is, if they were able to make GERENDE talk before we could save hing The danger to LIMITATION was not brought out in the Station's survey.

11. In re para. 5, recommendations -

a. Approve.

b. Det his off LIFEAT right now.

c. Concur, but liquidate LICALLA.

d. This needs some discussion, What do we do with GERENDE in the U. S.?

e. Concur.

f. Concur with reservation noted above.

g. O. K.

h. I don't see why he can't handle all these jobs since they are physical surveillances.

i. Not a bad idea.

12. Final observations:

a. What is GERENDE's cover?

b. We must be sure he is not overworked. Sloppy work has resulted from people being overworked.

On 3 July 1957 an Audio Briefing was given to Raymond H. GEREDE.
The major portion of the briefing was on the Revere T-700 tape recorder. When asked if he knew anything about recorders, GERENTE stated that he was quite familiar with the Revere 1-700 as he had had some experience with this recorder when he was a disc jockey in a radio station. A step by step operation of the recorder was explained to him, the tape recorder head was explained also how the sound was recorded on the tape. The following were also explained to him: tape speeds, frequency response, footage indicator, dual tracks-how they can be used in the Revere T-700-, the mechanical section of the recorder and the amplifier.

The recorder was removed from the case by the Subject and the possible breakdown points were shown to him, the recorder and amplifier units wore taken out of the case by his and the operation of the sections explained. The recorder was then put together by GEFEME.

GEREDE asked many questions relative to micro hones and microchone installations. There were explained to him-carbon microphone, crystal microphone, dynamic and controlled reluctance.

He appeared to be intelligent and was interested in the subjects discussed.

## F. Interviews of Subject

Another Government agency that conducts security investigations interviewed ROBERT SCHEER July 11, 1958, August 10, 1961 and August 16, 1961, the last interview being under oath. During the interviews, SCHEER stated that while in college he attended a few meetings which he felt were run by someone who could have been in the Labor Youth League (LYL) and had attended one social event which he felt was definitely sponsored by LYL, but explained that he had gone to this affair to meet a girl. He said he never attended a political meetings of LYL and added that he has never been a member of the CP or any organization cited by the Attorney General. SCHEER admitted having read the "Communist Manifesto" frequently and studied it as an example of ideological development.

SCHEER said under oath that he did not consider the CP, USA to be a threat to the United States and had no reason to believe that a person who joins the CP swears allegiance to a foreign power or advocates the overthrow of the United States Government. He said he believes that the CP is not subversive because it claims to be interested in bringing about its program through democratic process. SCHEER refused to discuss his trip to Cuba in 1960 and refused to discuss his membership, activities or associations with the Student Fair Play for Cuba Committee (SFPCC) under protection of the First and Fifth Amendments.

SCHEER stated under oath that he has never been arrested and that he considers he owes his allegiance to the United States, but does not believe in the philosophy

H. Marital Discord

ROBERT SCHEER has been living at his home, 6468 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland, California, since about September 7, 1968. On September 26, 1968, Mrs. ANNE SCHEER told some of the neighbors that she and ROBERT SCHEER were separating because they live different kinds of lives. ANNE SCHEER said she was moving to an apartment somewhere near the Oakland-Berkeley border where she planned to live with a man named TOM, not further identified, whom she expected to marry eventually. Mrs. SCHEER was busy removing her belongings from the residence at 6468 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland, on September 26, 1968.

ROBERT SCHEER was at his residence, 6468 Benvenue
Avenue, Oakland, on October 19, 1968 and had his infant son
with him. He also has a new girl friend who looks like a
"hippie" who has been at this residence quite a lot in
recent weeks. It is understood that SCHEER's son has been
residing with his mother at a different location.

Mrs. JOHN G. GWILLIAM,
6480 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, California
October 21, 1968

Mrs. GEORGIA SWILLIAM, 6480 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland,
California, reported October 14, 1968 that ANNE SCHEER had
been living with THOMAS HAYDEN while ROBERT SCHEER was away
on trips for "Ramparts" magazine and now appears to have
taken their child and both are residing with HAYDEN full
time at HAYDEN's apartment. The SCHEERs reportedly had
reached a mutual agreement to get a divorce.

ROBERT and ANNE SCHEER reside at 6468 Benvenue
Avenue, Oakland, California, and most of the neighbors refuse
to associate with them. There has never been any sign of
emotion or warmth exhibited between them. When THOMAS HAYDEN
arrived in early September 1968, it became very evident that
ANNE SCHEER was very strongly attracted to him in a physical
way. ANNE is believed to have met HAYDEN in Hanoi, North
Vietnam during the summer of 1968. When ROBERT SCHEER made
trips away from home, HAYDEN would move into the SCHEER
residence. During October 1968, ANNE SCHEER indicated she
intended to seek a divorce from ROBERT SCHEER and would move
into the apartment of THOMAS HAYDEN. Beginning about
Christmas, 1968, ANNE SCHEER returned home with the SCHEER
baby and has remained with ROBERT SCHEER for the past month
or more. THOMAS HAYDEN has not been observed in the company
of ANNE SCHEER or visiting the SCHEER residence in more than
one month. There are numerous visitors to the SCHEER
residence and it would appear that several men were living
at this residence regularly in addition to the SCHEERS.
While ANNE SCHEER was in Hanoi, ROBERT SCHEER received a
threat to his life that frightened him greatly. He moved

"RAMPARTS" MAGAZINE

"Pamparts" in a letter to subscribers dated May 1, 1968, announced that beginning June 1, 1968, it would be published biweekly at a yearly subscription price of $15. In this letter "Ramparts" described itself as follows: "...the first national publication to consistently reveal the ribbon of lies supporting America's involvement in Vietnam; we stripped the curtain from America's 'invisible government' by exposing CIA's unlicensed intrusion into our domestic lives; we dared to write about the applications of the Catholic Church's political power; we warned, years before the Kerner report, that white racism was the base of America's racial problems; we blasted away at the corroded institutions of Cold War liberalism.

'Ramparts' is now the largest left-of-center commercial magazine in the history of the United States..."

# I. Burning of Draft Card

The cover of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts" magazine contains a photograph of four right hands each holding a burning Selective Service card. One of the cards is a duplicate issued December 3, 1958 of the "Selective Service Registration Certificate" for ROBERT SCHEER, 653 Britton Street, New York 67, Bronx.

The San Francisco "Examiner," daily newspaper published in San Francisco, California, in its issue of November 16, 1967, carried an article headlined "Ramparts Editors Burn Draft Cards" which quoted "Publisher MARC STONE" of "Ramparts" as saying the magazine cover is "a very serious editorial statement," adding "there is a very serious political crisis in this country and we want to show that the bureaucracy of the Selective Service System is unfair."

The San Francisco "Examiner" daily newspaper, issue of June 13, 1968, carried a news article "3 Ramparts Officers Before Jury in NY." This article stated that three top officers of "Ramparts" magazine were called to appear before a Federal Grand Jury in New York City, June 13, 1968 to testify at an inquiry described only as "having to do with Selective Service." The article continued by stating that there was speculation that the investigation dealt with the cover photograph of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts", which pictured the flaming draft cards of 3 top officials. (Should be four officials.)

The August 24, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" magazine carried a column entitled, "Apologia," which carried a reprint of a news article from the "New York Times" news- paper, issue of July 18, 1968. The article stated that WARREN HINCKLE, III, ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD STERMER, and SOL STEIN, all officials of "Ramparts", appeared before a Grand Jury in New York City on June 17, 1968, as a result of the December 1967 cover of "Ramparts" containing a photo- graph of four hands holding burning draft cards containing the names of these four men.

J. Threat to Subject's Life

ROBERT SCHEER telephoned the San Francisco FBI
Office on July 8, 1968, to state the receptionist at
"Ramparts" magazine, San Francisco, received the following
telephone message from an anonymous male at 4:45 pm that
day:

"I just want to inform you that we
plan to destroy the Managing Editor,
BOB SCHEER, tomorrow night at 9:00."

SCHEER stated that the New York City Office of
"Ramparts" had received a threat about July 3, 1968 and
he felt that this call resulted from a recent article in
"Ramparts" regarding Cuban refugees. He said he had no
indication that the call was interstate.

The San Francisco "Examiner" newspaper, San
Francisco, California, in its issue of July 9, 1968,
carried a news article headlined, "Ramparts Threatened
By Bombs." The article stated that both the San Francisco
and New York City offices of "Ramparts" had been threatened
by bombs and "Associate Editor ROBERT SCHEER had received
calls threatening his life."

SCHEER advised SA CHARLES E. GALVIN on July 10,
1968, that no one had carried out the threat and that
he would immediately contact the FBI if any future threats
were made.

Records of the Bureau of Criminal Identification
and Investigation (CII), Sacramento, California, reveal
that a .25 calibre Beretta automatic pistol, serial number
415984, was sold to ROBERT SCHEER, 6468 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, California, on January 27, 1968, and that this gun
was purchased in Oakland.

Records of the Oakland Police Department were
searched October 17, 1968 by IC ROBERT L. GIBSON and it
was determined that ROBERT SCHEER did not possess a permit
to carry a gun.

L. Passport Information

Files of the Passport Office, US Department of State, Washington, D. C., were reviewed by SA DOUGLAS M. BROWN on January 26, 1968 and reflected the following.

On January 28, 1966, Passport number G 41559 was issued at the San Francisco Passport Agency to ROBERT SCHEER, based on his application, January 27, 1966. SCHEER stated he was born April 4, 1936 at Bronx, New York, was a writer by occupation, residing at 2828 Milvia Street, Berkeley, California.

His last passport, number D 163804, was issued February 5, 1963. It was cancelled and returned to SCHEER when the above application was submitted. His parents were identified as FRED SCHEER, born in Germany, May 5, 1898, and IDA KURAN, born in Russia, April 24, 1900. His father was a United States citizen, but his mother was not a citizen. He was last married in 1965 to ANNE BUTTERFIELD WEILLS, born Eureka, California, March 14, 1942. She was designated as the person to be notified in an emergency at the above address. SCHEER stated in the application that he planned to depart San Francisco via Japan Airlines for a trip of one month to Japan, Cambodia and Hong Kong for journalistic purposes.

On November 29, 1967, SCHEER wrote a letter on the letterhead of "Ramparts" magazine and signed the letter as Managing Editor of that publication, which he sent to the Visa Department, US Department of State, Washington, D. C., stating he had been invited to attend a cultural conference in Havana, Cuba, in January 1968, by the Cuban Commission to

the United Nations. He stated he found it necessary in his
position to accept this invitation and requested a visa for
this purpose.

The Department of State advised SCHEER by letter
dated December 18, 1967 that provided he would execute the
enclosed affidavit stating that he desired to attend the
conference as a professional reporter and would not par-
ticipate in the conference in any manner, his application
would appear to qualify under existing regulations.

On December 20, 1967, SCHEER returned the affidavit
which was executed on that date before a notary public in
San Francisco. On December 27, 1967, the San Francisco
Passport Office was authorized by the State Department to
validate SCHEER's passport for one round trip to Cuba.
The State Department files reflect that the passport was
so validated at San Francisco on December 29, 1967.

Miss MADELINE EBINGER, Clerk, Passport Office,
US Department of State, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco,
advised March 20, 1968 that her office received authoriza-
tion from the State Department, Washington, D. C. on March
19, 1968 to validate the passport of ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD
STERMER and FREDERICK C. MITCHELL, all of "Ramparts" magazine
for one round trip to Cuba, each for journalistic purposes.
STERMER is art director of "Ramparts" magazine and MITCHELL
a senior editor of "Ramparts". Miss EBINGER expected SCHEER
to appear in the immediate future for this validation since
she stated he has been telephoning the passport office
daily for the past week to determine if the validation of his
passport had been authorized.

On April 16, 1968, ROBERT SCHEER was observed by
a Special Agent of the FBI to visit the Passport Office of
the State Department in San Francisco, where he had his
passport validated for one round trip to Cuba. This was
confirmed by MADELINE EBINGER the same day.

Mrs. DOROTHY GIBBS, Passport Office, US Department
of State (USDS), Washington, D. C., stated on August 29,

1968 to SE ROBERT P. LYNCH that the State Department wired the San Francisco Passport Agency instructing, "You are authorzied to validate passport G 041559, issued to ROBERT SCHEER of 'Ramparts, valid for one round trip to Cuba."

Miss MADELINE EBINGER advised on September 18, 1968 that records of that office reflect that the passport of ROBERT SCHEER was validated for one round trip to Cuba on August 22, 1968. She said she recalled that an unknown man appeared at the Passport Office a few minutes before closing time on August 22, 1968 and insisted that the passport be validated that evening since ROBERT SCHEER intended to depart that evening.

The PW issue of February 12, 1966, contained an
article headlined"A New Campaign Tackles Old Issues,"
written by CARL BLOICE. This article gives historical
background of the City of Oakland, California and the
problems faced by the poor people in that city. It then
cites how DANIEL SIMON, M. D. had sent hundreds of letters
to Berkeley, California during the wekk of June 22, 1965,
pointing out that Congressman JEFFREY COHELAN had failed
to take a stand in opposition to United States participation
in the war in Vietnam, and enclosed cards addressed to
Congressman COHELAN appealing to COHELAN to speak out
strongly in Congress for a cease fire and international
negotiations through the United Nations. The cards also
stated that unless COHELAN took such action, he would be
opposed for re-election. By August 1965, there had been
750 cards processed and returned to Dr. SIMON. When
Congressman COHELAN failed to speak out in Congress opposing
US involvement in Vietnam, certain people began searching
for a candidate to oppose him. ROBERT SCHEER agreed to
oppose COHELAN. Some of his supporters left the organization
because SCHEER refused to shave off his beard and others
left the organization because SCHEER refused to exclude Communists fro
his campaign committee. The article stated ROBERT SCHEER
had the endorsement of the VDC as well as a sizeable portion
of the community, and was not centered among the college
students.

In early 1966, two functionaries of the CP discussed
the forthcoming trip by SCHEER to Southeast Asia and his
desire to go to North Vietnam. Both functionaries agreed

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette" newspaper, Perkeley, California, issue of June 9, 1966, carried a news article regarding the defeat of ROBERT SCHEER in his campaign as Democratic candidate for U. S. Congressman from the 7th Congressional District of California. This article stated SCHEER received a total of 28,751 votes, while his Democratic opponent, JEFFREY COHELAN, received 35,270 votes. This indicates SCHEER captured 45 per cent of the votes in this primary election. The newspaper quoted SCHEER as stating "From now on I'm the shadow Congressman in this District." He added that he would be a write-in candidate for U. S. Congressman in the November, 1966 election unless Congressman JEFFREY COHELAN stopped supporting the Vietnam war and unless COHELAN faced up to the serious social problems in the U. S. SCHEER added that he and his backers were "building a political movement in this District and this campaign was only the opening wedge."

During the interview, SCHEER said the cost of running his campaign had been $35,000 to $40,000, most of it being donated by "students, housewives, longshoremen and what-have-you," and none of it coming from his own pocket. He said, "When I started this campaign I didn't have a dime."

of this report.

On February 21, 1968, there was a discussion led
by TERENCE W. GREENE in Oakland, California, regarding a
recent meeting of the East Bay CP Regional Committee.
At this regional meeting, there was a discussion of whether
the CP should support the PFP candidates. It was stated

supporting certain PFP candidates such as ROBERT SCHEER. The
matter was not resolved at this meeting.

The "PW" issue of March 16, 1968, carried a news
article entitled "PFP, New Party to Set Aims." In this
article it was stated "Author ROBERT SCHEER announced last
week he was withdrawing from contention, although some
political observers say he may be courting a possible draft
movement" for the US Senate on the PFP ticket. The article
told of plans of the PFP to have a state-wide conference,
March 16-18, 1968, at Richmond, California, to pass a state-
ment of basic principles and to refine planks for a platform.

The "Berkeley Barb", a weekly underground newspaper
that features news of left wing groups, published in Berkeley,
California, in its issue of March 15-21, 1968, carried a news
article headlined "Differs But Will Fight for Party." This
article dealt with the decision of ROBERT SCHEER not to
run for the US Senate on the PFP ticket. SCHEER was quoted
as saying, "I can be more helpful without being a candidate.
I want to work hard for PFP without being accused of doing
it for personal advantage.

"I will also be free of the petty in-fighting that
goes on too much in PFP. I am talking about PFP in Berkeley.
This does not apply to the rest of the state."

SCHEER was also quoted as being critical of his critics in the 1966 Congressional campaign as follows:

"Without those 1966 peace campaigns, there would be no PFP today. In this area, my campaign gave rise to CNP (Community for New Politics) and CNP formed the base for PFP here. I made the motion in a CNP meeting to form PFP."

"That Congressional campaign did give rise to organization on the left and its continuity is visibly demonstrated by the fact that we turned our main office at 2214 Grove (Berkeley) into the headquarters of PFP."

also known as
Committee for New Politics

"Communique for New Politics, Left-Out News", published bi-weekly by the Community for New Politics, 2214 Grove Street, Berkeley, California, 94703, in volume number one, carried an ar icle captioned, "To All Who Supported Scheer for Congress". This article stated:

"Our campaign was founded on assumptions which are at odds with mainstream American politics. We are concerned with issues and not personalities."

"We were committed to development of community dialogue and involvement and not merely to electoral victory. The fact that we obtained an unexpectedly large vote does not change this commitment but rather reinforces it. 'The Community for New Politics' was formed to carry out this commitment. We are, in fact, in a very favorable position to implement a 'new politics'. The campaign produced strong community ties and the beginnings of a serious program. If we succeed in new politics it will serve as a much needed model for American political life. If we fail to seriously attempt it we betray not only the larger community but our most significant hopes as well."

"This will be a more difficult period than that which preceded the election--it requires all of our support."

The only person mentioned by name in this article was FOBERT SCHEER. The remarks related to SCHEER are as follows:

"Perhaps the strangest performance of the whole incredible drama was that of Fobert Sheer, managing editor of Ramparts magazine who last year ran a strong, though losing, primary race in California's Berkeley district as a peace candidate against an incumbent Democratic congressman.

"On one convention day, Sheer stood before the assembled delegates and eloquently pleaded with the whites to purge themselves of self-contempt and self-hate. He called on them to find ways to build bridges to other whites whose sympathies must be won if white radicals are ever to bring any real power to a coalition with Negroes. Said Sheer:

"'You're helping the black people and the poor, but you can't talk to your own parents or to từ kids you grew up with on your block.'

## Has CNP

Grow Up?

Robert Scheer has his own differences with fellow member's of the New Left, he said here Friday.

In his talk to the City Commons Club, he said the nation for years had operated under a theory which blamed communism as "the devil" responsible for all world turmoil. A listener askeil: "Desn't the New Left. have its own devil theory agairst liberals and Democrats?"

Scheer replied: "I have my own differences with the New Lelt because of the fact that I wear suits and have a job."

He wore a suit of muted plaid pattern with a vest, striped, button-down shirt with a long collar and figured tie.

He continued: "Here in Berkeley the Community for New Politics is generally beyond the student stage, over 30. I came to the New Left through traditional politics. When I ran for Congress I received the CDC (California Democratic Council) endorsement, though I didn't recognize many faces at the meeting."

Scheer added: "I got the support from liberal people because they were disillusioned with liberal policies. I don't like stopping troop trains or picketing. But I did not come to the New Left without coming through liberal politics.

"I went to the Democratic Party convention of 1956. I vas once on the national board of ADA (Americans for Democratic Action). There is a great danger in symbols. There is a great number of symbols that are attacked and deserve to be attacked."

| Scheer continued: "Our form of dress, sexual mores, many aspects of middle class society are boring. We go in for artificial pursuits such as watching television and fixing up our homes. I find every restaurant I eat in in San Francisco boring.
| "The hippies force us to re-examine these things even the New Left can learn from the hippies."

# I. Peace and Freedom Party and Black Panther Party

The "San Francisco Examiner," a daily newspaper published at San Francisco, California, in its issue of October 3, 1967, carried a news article headlined "New Peace Party's Aim - Beat LBJ." The article explained that "the newly formed Peace and Freedom Party is out to beat President Johnson in 1968 even at the expense of electing his Republican opponent."

The article continued by saying that the new Peace and Freedom Party was recently formed in an effort to promote peace candidates and had initiated a drive for the 67,000 signatures needed to put a Peace and Freedom Party candidate on the ballot. ROBERT SCHEER was listed as one of the founders of the Peace and Freedom Party.

The "Berkeley Barb," a weekly newspaper of the left, published at Berkeley, California, in its issue of March 15-21, 1968, carried an article headlined, "Differs but Will Fight for Party." This article explained that ROBERT SCHEER's decision to withdraw as a Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) candidate for nomination as U.S. Senator, was based primarily on differences with the PFP leadership over how to conduct the campaign. SCHEER was quoted as saying, "I think it is possible to conduct a radical campaign and at the same time reach out to bring people in. I don't agree that there is a conflict between educating people and running a principled campaign. There are purists in PFP who will be talking only to small meetings of convinced people. Some of the purists seem to want a small, left wing, vegetarian-type party." SCHEER also objected to being asked for loyalty to the PFP program before it had been adopted. SCHEER said he expects to campaign very actively for PFP, but stated his position with "Ramparts" Magazine also creates demands on his time.

The article added that SCHEER said he wanted to work hard for PFP without being accused of doing it for personal advantage. SCHEER also said he wanted to be free of the petty in-fighting that goes on too much in the Berkeley PFP.

SCHEER also claimed that his unsuccessful campaign for nomination as U. S. Congressman from the 7th Congressional District of California gave rise to the Community for New Politics (CNP) and the CNP formed the base for PFP locally.

CP Support for PFP

A meeting of the Campus CP Club was held February 4, 1968, at 3048 Deakin Street, Berkeley, California, during which there was a discussion of political activities. One of the members noted that ROBERT SCHEER had decided to run for the Senate and HUEY NEWTON had been drafted to run for Congress, each on the PFP ticket and he suggested that all Communist Party (CP) group members work for the PFP.

A meeting of the Southern California District CP Committee was held March 2, 1968, at Hungarian Hall, 1251 South Andrews Place, Los Angeles, California. During this meeting, there was a discussion of political activities and the PFP. The CP's position was that the PFP is an independent party with a radical potential and that CP members in PFP would be fighting for that position. It was stated that there were three PFP candidates running for the U.S. Senate in the primary election and the CP would support ROBERT SCHEER and would urge people to vote for him in the primary election.

The "People's World" (PW) newspaper in its issue
of May 11, 1968, carried a half page article consisting of
an interview with BOB MANDEL, who had been arrested twice
for his leadership in anti-draft activities. The article
stated that funds were being raised to defray legal costs
of MANDEL and six others arrested in the anti-draft activities,
and that contributions to the Oakland Seven Defense Fund
should be sent to 6468 Benvenue Avenue, Oakland, California
(residence of ROBERT and ANNE SCHEER).

Support of HBEY NEWTON

The "Berkeley Barb,"an underground newspaper
published weekly in Berkeley, California, in its issue
of October 25-31, 1968, carried a newspaper article head-
lined "Scheer supports Newton." This article stated "Bob
Schaer endorsed Huey Newton for Congress last week." It
quoted Scheer as saying, "I ran against Cohelan in 1966
because the assumptions that he shared with the democratic
establishment and the powerful interests behind it led him
to support the war in Vietnam and to ignore the increasingly
desperate crisis in our cities, including the miserable conditions
right here in Oakland."

The article pointed out that HUEY P. NEWTON was
running against JEFFREY COHELAN as the PFP candidate in the
California 7th Congressional District, COHELAN being the Democratic
Party candidate and the incumbent. The article continued by
quoting ROBERT SCHEER as saying, "I have come to know and
respect HUEY over the past two years, and I am very pleased
to support him for Congress."

America must pull out of Vietnam because it is essentially wrong. The dominant political institutions are responsible for the U. S. involvement in Vietnam.

Relations are unwholesome between white radicals and black panthers. The Panthers are becoming better organized and can reach more people than white people can reach. The Panthers wrote a book to obtain money with which to purchase guns.

At the same meeting, GEORGE MURRAY, Minister of Education of BPP also spoke condemning the institutions in the U.S. as all being racist and working to keep the black people enslaved. MURRAY stated that if the black people wanted anything they had to get it with guns and force.

III FOREIGN TRAVEL

## Trip to Indonesia, February, 1965

An American by the name of SHEA (phonetic), who claims that he is an ex-professor of a California University, visited Japan about February 11, 1965. He went to visit the office of the National Harbor and Ports Labor Union in Tokyo. The Japan labor union put up SHEA in one of their dormitories and had him live there until three days ago, when he left Japan and went to Indonesia on a ten-day trip. Before he left Japan for Indonesia, he claimed that he strongly desired to go to Communist China. He was complaining to the Japanese labor union officials about the discrimination problem in the U. S. and made derogatory remarks about the U.S. The Japanese labor union official, after listening to his desire to go to Communist China, asked the Chinese Communists now staying in Tokyo about the possibility of SHEA's trip to the Chinese mainland. The Chinese did not give a decisive answer. Although SHEA is expected to return to Japan after his trip from Indonesia, he may go to China directly from Indonesia. It is said that SHEA had to quit his university job due to an article he wrote after he came back from a trip to Cuba. The article contained some derogatory remarks about the U.S. Government.[^1]

It added that SCHEER, "an outspoken critic of the Johnson Administration policies in Viet Nam, is presently touring South Viet Nam and Cambodia, the latter country at the invitation of Prince SIHANOUK." It continued by stating, "Foreign Editor of Ramparts, author of 'Cuba - Tragedy in a Hemisphere' and 'How the United States Got Involved in Viet Nam.' SCHEER is also known for his association with the Center for Study of Democratic Institutions at Santa Barbara." The article concluded by stating that Women for Peace would vote on endonging SCHEER's candidacy at this meeting.

SCHEER said he visited Cambodia at the invitation of its government and was sent there by "Ramparts" Magazine, of which he is Foreign Editor. He said he was accompanied by STANLEY SCHEINBAUM, "an adviser to the Diem Government in Vietnam from 1955 to 1961." SCHEER asserted that after exploring the entire frontier between Cambodia and South Vietnam, he concluded that "Cambodia was not being used in any significant way, to support the fighting in South Vietnam." He explained that by any significant way he meant that Cambodia was not a "major staging area for the Viet Cong."

A CP contact class was held February 4, 1966, at 631 Redwood Street, San Francisco, during which it was stated that ROBERT SCHEER had left San Francisco February 4, 1966, for Cambodia and there was a very good possibility that SCHEER would also visit North Vietnam.

in Washington." The report said that an editor of "Ramparts"
magazine had visited Prague and held "a long, secret session"
with officers of the Communist controlled International Union
of Students (IUS).

The article continued by stating that "Ramparts"
is the magazine that exposed the fact that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been financing the National
Student Association (NSA), which in turn had worked for
several years to prevent IUS from dominating the youth of the
world. The article questioned what relationship there was
between "Ramparts" and the IUS.

ROWAN telephoned ROBERT SCHEER, Managing Editor of
"Ramparts" in San Francisco and SCHEER admitted that he had
met with representatives of the National Liberation Front,
political arm of the Communist Viet Cong, in South Vietnam,
and also with IUS officers in Prague "several weeks ago"
for two days. In response to a question as to who controlled
IUS, SCHEER replied, "It is essentially an organ of the
foreign policy of the Soviet Union." SCHEER emphasized
that he had visited IUS headquarters strictly for journalistic
reasons and that he was in Europe writing a story for "Ramparts"
on Bertrand Russell, "(94 year old British philosopher who
plans a Vietnam 'war crimes trial' of President Johnson)", so
he continued on to Prague to check the international implications
of the "Ramparts" article on the NSA. SCHEER volunteered, "We
don't truck with Communism in Ramparts. We compare the U.S.
position in Vietnam with the actions of the Soviet Union in
Hungary. Both are intolerable and we make no bones about it.
Any attempt to smear us at Ramparts is libelous and we'll sue.
I warned the same thing when they were muttering about me
being a Communist when I ran for Congress."

ROBERT SCHEER traveled to Prague, Czechoslovakia

This editorial described SCHEER as Managing Editor of "Ramparts" magazine and an unsuccessful candidate in the primary election of 1966.

The editorial stated SCHEER had recently returned from a trip to Cairo and Israel and then spoke at a meeting in Berkeley, California, August 25, 1967, when he told his audience about his trip. In his speech, SCHEER claimed he had been accused of being an anti-Semite and an anti-Arab because of what he said on the matter of Arab-Israel relations. The editorial said that SCHEER referred constantly to the people of Israel and the American Jews as the "Zionists" and uses this term constantly when criticizing action of the Israelis.

The editorial continued by stating that SCHEER accused the Zionists of being imperialistic, of being excessively hard on the poor Arabs they defeated, of provoking the war - in short, of doing everything the Arabs and the Soviets accused them of and SCHEER attributed these lies to Israel's subservience to the United States." In his speech, SCHEER was further accused of using the term, "American Grand Concourse Zionists," the "Anti-Semites favorite euphemism for Jew."

the North Vietnamese to 'observe' the prisoner exchange."

ROBERT SCHEER contacted JOSE VIERA LINARES, First
Secretary, Cuban Mission to the United Nations (CMUN), New

wife was then at the Hotel Algonquin in New York City. SCHEER
asked VIERA to contact Mrs. SCHEER and VIERA agreed to do so.
VIERA also said he had a copy of the original publication of
CHE GUEVARA's diary for SCHEER and would give it to Mrs.

## IV. WRITINGS OF SUBJECT

ROBERT SCHEER is the author of a pamphlet written for the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, which he later condensed into an article for "Ramparts" magazine entitled, "The Vietnam Lobby." The article purports to show how various Americans worked to misinform the public about Vietnam. The persons whom SCHEER holds responsible for misleading the American people are JOSEPH KENNEDY, Cardinal SPELLMAN, ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, JR., NORMAN THOMAS, J. BRACKEN LEE, General EDWARD LANSDALE, MARVIN LIEBMAN, and others.

A feature article datelined Cairo, July 31, 1967, entitled, "Egypt" which is described as "A Special Report from Managing Editor ROBERT SCHEER in Cairo", was published in the September 1967 issue of "Ramparts" magazine. In this article, SCHEER tried to explain the current situation in Egypt. He laid the blame for the Arabs losing the six-day war to the Israelis on "cowardly or traitorous officers" in the Arab Army.

The article also stated that many in the NASSER Goverment say that most of the blame for starting the Arab-Israel war should be charged to the Syrians for having provided the Israelis with a pretext for attack. The article stated the Egyptian people were not at this time in a warlike mood and NASSER was doing his best to discourage his people from warlike aspirations and to encourage continuance of the Social revolution in Egypt.

SCHEER concluded that NASSER must break with the rightists in the Arab world and make his primary commitment to the Arab social revolution in order to survive. He concluded also that NASSER's most dangerous enemy is the "Moslem Brotherhood" who could take control of Egypt and become embroiled in another war in as little as one year's time.

The November 1967 issue of "Ramparts" magazine contains a 13-page article entitled, "A NASSER Thesis" by ROBERT SCHEEP. In this article, SCHEER analyzes the Middle East situation from 1952 to the present, giving his recital of the relationship of the various countries to each other, the rise to power by GAMAL ABDUL NASSER, the Suez war in the middle 1950's, and the six-day Arab-Israel war in June, 1967.

The article lays great stress on NASSER being unsuccessful in some of his ventures because while he nationalized many businesses and industries and distributed the proceeds to the poor, he allowed the Army to remain an elite, privileged class which was not loyal to either NASSER or Egypt. SCHEER also blamed NASSER's failure to develop a political party with its own aims set forth for his lack of success in communicating with his people and obtaining their full support.

The January, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" Magazine contains an article entitled "Oil and the Arabs (The Nasser Thesis: Part 2)" This article states "Researchers for this article and Part I ("Ramparts", November, 1967) include BOB AVAKIAN, JIM HAWLEY, DAVID KOLODNEY and JOHN SPITZER."

The article states the thesis that the Middle East is "of paramount strategic importance to this Country" because the Persian Gulf produces 27% of the world's petroleum and has proved global reserves of 60%. In addition the Mideast is the trade crossroads between Asia and Europe and an important cultural bridge between Africa and Asia and the center of the Islam world.

The article explains that 27% of the oil used throughout the world comes from the Middle East and, since oil is indispensable to industrial and military potential it is no wonder that continued control of this resource is a major focus of the Western powers. It adds that if control of this oil is important to the West it is absolutely critical to the Arabs, since it is the only source of the cash needed to break out of the cycle of underdevelopment and poverty in which their countries are trapped. It pointed out that the profits from the oil go to the "wrong" states, those with the least population (12% of the Arab population) and therefore the least need. The article stated the Arabs could repay the total investment of Western powers of $5 billion in two years with the oil removed from Arab wells except for the fact that Western Countries are in a position to force the Arabs to deal with them or to have no market whatever for this oil. The article cited how Iranian Prime Minister MOSSADEGH nationalized his country's oil production May 1, 1951 and the U. S. proceeded to crush him so totally that the example has served as a chilling model for other would-be nationalists - no major oil producing country in the Mideast has dared to repeat MOSSADEGH'S attempt." The Western Powers were said to have accomplished this by imposing a total boycott of Iranian oil.

The article explained that the Baghdad Pact was an integral part of a global containment policy which was put' into effect by the U.S. in the early 1950s but NASSER refused to align himself with it. NASSER was said to be a threat to the Western powers by being consciously and arrogantly expansionist,

and by holding the position that oil in the underpopulated oil producing countries must be the basis of the development of the entire region. It stated that the U.S. response to NASSER was principally by propping up the economy and military machines of the monarchies while alternately mollifying through grants or the withholding of grants to the more leftist tendencies as they appear- ed in Egypt and other Arab regimes. The article added "Intensive CIA operations even involved founding the American Friends of the Middle East - a pro-Arab Organization in the U.S. - as well as widespread meddling in internal Arab politics."

The article continued that Soviet support of the Arabs began in 1955, which caused the U. S. to be more careful not to cause an anti-Western Arab union to be formed that might topple America's right-wing Arab allies. NASSER was said to have steered clear of any major direct confrontation with the U.S. and "the U.S. has never attempted to really clamp down on him." Thus the Arab revolutionary impulse, fearful of challenging the West, turned to "challenging Israel as a Western tool" and condemned "Israeli im- perialism." This hostility to Israel provided a kind of anti- imperialism that was able to appeal to both progressive leftists and traditional monarchies in the Arab world. In 1956 Israel joined the British and French attempt to reestablish by force Western control over the Suez Canal after NASSER nationalized it, and Israel also supported the French in the Algerian war. To the Arabs it seemed that Israel had aligned herself with the exploiters. This signalled the Russians to begin helping the Arabs to get as many friends as possible among the non-aligned countries even while local communists in Egypt, Algeria and Syria were being jailed. Russia felt that the Arabs were moving to the left to justify Fuscian support.

The article said the social changesin Algeria and Egypt were significant but also inadequate because they destroyed the power of the traditional upper class without in any significant sense passing power on to that very broad base of the Arab pyramid. The reforms in Syria and Egypt came about as a result of military coups d'etat which placed men in power who were willing to introduce re- forms.

The article continued by stating "The identification of Israel-rather than the oil companies and their monarchies-as the serious extension of imperialism has allowed Arab progressives to play at revolution, through periodic anti-Israel tirades, without

taking essential revolutionary action." In reference to the
six day Arab-Israel war the article stated "the Soviets were clearly
unprepared to assess its implications," in reference to with-
drawal of UN troops from Gaza and Aqoba. It added "The Soviets
continuously underestimated the emotional depth and political
intensity of the Arab-Israeli conflict." It added that Russia
began immediately to rearm Eghpt and Syria after the defeat,
specifying only that their weapons be better used.

The article stated "The Central Thesis of this essay
is that the Great Powers cannot be expected to be concerned, on any
consistent basis, with the interests and needs of the Arabs and
Jews who live in the Mideast," but are preoccupied with their
own prestige and security needs. It added that both the Arabs and
the Jews identify their opposition with the nation of imperialism
supported by the American oil companies.

The article added that "The Arab denial of legitimate
Jewish nationhood as the basis of Israel is the subject of deserved
ridicule. But that the mainstream of Zionism has, in like fashion,
denied the existence of a legitimate Arab quest for nationhood is
not commonly admitted. This factor has been of great significance
in the formation and sustaining of Arab hostility towards Israel.
The Arabs will never be able to turn their energies from opposing
Israel to the development of an Arab nation so long as the Israelis
hold the existence of an Arab nation to be a threat." The Israelis
viewed the drive toward Arab unity and independence as a threat
to them. ABBA EBAN conferred upon Israel the very nationhood that
Israel denied to the Arabs. The Arabs find this position most
difficult to accept when the Jews deny them the same po position.
The article stated that "sraelis must come to accept the fact that
nationhood is an aspiration which some Arabs hold without being
conned into it by NASSER; and that an Arab State - if it became a
reality (as a confederation or a nation) - is not necessarily a
threat to Israel."

The article concluded that "The Arab Nation and the
Jewish Nation are both legitimate concepts which can survive to-
gether only if they exist as part of the same social revolution
to meet the needs of the people of the Mideast."

The "Stockton Record" newspaper, Stockton, California, issue of September 8, 1966, carried a news article headlined, "Editor Attacks U. S. Policy in Vietnam; Sees National Peril." In this article it was stated that ROBERT SCHEER had delivered a speech at the Raymond College High Table, University of the Pacific, Stockton, California, on September 7, 1966. SCHEER maintained that the concept of an international communist conspiracy was false and the U. S. is mistaken in considering it a unified, ever-growing force that can only be contained by force. He stated that the communist conspiracy is a movement that does not hold together because of nationalistic interests. He cited the Sino-Soviet dispute and the international squabbling between satellite countries and the major communist powers. He said the Vietnam conflict began as an internal dispute and if the U. S. withdrew from the conflict this withdrawal would reaffirm the communists' confidence in the possibility of peaceful co-existence.

He concluded that if anyone is genuinely concerned about American security, he is going to have to work to reverse American foreign policy.

He was reported to have reviewed the historical changes in Vietnam, the French role in Vietnam affairs, and the limited policy set by President KENNEDY of only sending 30,000 advisors as "technical aid only for a limited period of time to prevent a colonial posture." The article stated further, "In a summary conclusion SCHEER said that if there is an international communist movement, it should cease to exist, that there are hardly two communist countries that coexist, that communism is in truth a form of nationalism and that practically speaking, 'it does not exist.'"

Discussion Unlimited, Incorporated (DU), sponsored a meeting December 2, 1966, in the auditorium of Los Angeles Trade College, 700 block, Washington Boulevard, Los Angeles, with from 1,000 to 1,500 people in attendance. The topic of the discussion was "What Will the New Development on the Left Be?" ROBERT SCHEER from "Ramparts" magazine, EUGENE GENOVESE from Rutgers College in New Jersey, and DOROTHY HEALEY from Southern California District CP were the speakers. HEALEY spoke first, stating that the most important things for the groups on the left to do today were to unite on common grounds and to be critical on grounds where they cannot agree, as well as to give allegiance to the other 14 socialist countries in the world. She described these countries as the hope of the future. ROBERT SCHEER attacked her bitterly, his main contention being that he felt he could not even say he was a socialist because of all the crimes that are committed in the name of socialism. He said he could not align himself with other countries in the socialist world because of the barbaric deeds committed by some of these countries.

He led a vicious attack against the Soviet Union, against the STALIN era, against the crimes that were committed in the Soviet Union against Jewish people and Jewish culture, and against other religious people and intellectuals in the Soviet Union. He made reference to the two writers who had been recently jailed in Russia. In a rebuttal and question and answer period the attack went back and forth, mainly between GENOVESE and HEALEY against SCHEER for his anti-Soviet Union position. SCHEER constantly brought up Hungary, stating that the oppression that went on in Hungary is no different than the oppression of the United States in Vietnam. He also said the Soviet Union is a sick society just as the U. S. is a sick society, and he is quite sure that the workers in each society are not much aware of or care about the relative difference of the sickness.

The PW issue of December 10, 1966, and December 24, 1966, also carried news articles on the above-described forum. SCHEER's remarks are reported in the December 10, 1966 issue as follows:

"Scheer, who ran as a peace candidate in the Democratic primary in the Seventh Congressional District, winning nearly 45% of the vote, spoke of the kind of revolution he would like to see. 'Revolution is better than rebellion,' he said, 'but I am interested in what a revolution will lead to....Soviet society is vicious....I want a revolution that means the right of a man to control his own life.'

"Referring to Marxism, Scheer said, 'The theories don't work. The working class is not getting poorer and poorer.

"'It is true,' he said, 'that the 'New Left' has no ideology, (but because of that) it does not follow that it should accept the old ones...Why is there a New Left?

"'The old Left was tired, cynical, frightened... LSD is more important than (considered by the 'Old Left')...The young people who have looked at the American Dream and said it isn't so great have made a statement more profound than anything the Old Left has ever made'."

A characterization of DU is contained in the appendix.

"Anti-Communism is what holds the American people together, not the Judaeo-Christian ethic, radical author Robert Scheer told 500 people in the Social Science building Thursday.

"He argued that the United States is attempting to impose on the Southeast Asian crisis the 'myth' of a monolithic Communism and the policy of 'contain- ment' that developed out of the post-World War II Eastern European situation 20 years ago.

"He said that America has become 'so imbued with the anti-Communist mythology' that it has become the over-riding criteria for all, and especially foreign policy decision-making.

"He cited the investigations of philosopher Bertrand Russell's Vietnam 'War Crimes Tribunal' which purports to show American use of 'fragmentation bombs' that are not effective militarily, but which demoralize the population. 'And these bombs are designed not so much to kill as to torture.'

"'What is frighteningly horrible about this whole policy,' he said, 'is that it works. It succeeds militarily even where it fails politically.'

"He urged his listeners to 'support the Vietcong, or National Liberation Front...given the fact that they are the only ones standing up to the American 'intrusion' over there.'

"He said that it is not the North Vietnamese who have shown 'bad faith' in efforts to negotiate, 'but us.' They have already offered concessions, he said, 'even though it is we who are bombing them.'

"Russian and Chinese foreign policies, before and after the death of Stalin, he said, 'have been essentially conservative, and not aggressive.' He cited as evidence the Trotsky-Stalin conflict and Mao Tse-tung's early differences with the regular Chinese Communist Party apparatus over this issue."

A meeting was held at Hospitality House, Balboa Park, California, March 16, 1967, to hear ROBERT SCHEER talk on the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). He was introduced as editor of "Ramparts" magazine. His only comments concerning the CIA were that the CIA was the "whipping boy" for high officials of the U. S. Government. He indicated that if anything went wrong with the policy of the high government officials, they could always blame CIA for their failures.

In discussing the Vietnam war, SCHEER stated the President of the U. S., along with other government officials, were guilty of murder of innocent women and children. SCHEER then spoke of a trip he had taken to France and Belgium. He said he had talked to important officials in these countries and gained the impression that these officials were opposed to the war policy of President JOHNSON, particularly the bombing of North Vietnam. SCHEER alleged that there were more bombs dropped in Vietnam than were dropped during World War II. He claimed that the reason the U. S. was using anti-personnel bombs against the people of North Vietnam was because they did not agree with the U. S. and the use of anti-personnel bomb was of a punitive nature.

SCHEER took the position of an independent criticizing both the "Commie" and "Bircher" elements.

ROBERT SCHEER spoke at the rally of the Spring Mobilization Committee Against the War in Vietnam which was held April 15, 1967, at Kezar Stadium, San Francisco, California, with about 55,000 people in attendance. SCHEER remarked that General WESTMORELAND had stated that the Vietnamese people would have to "bleed more" to learn they had met their match in this war. SCHEER commented that despite United States' "intervention" in Vietnam, there would be "other Vietnams" as other rights groups and countries had their own nationalist expressions. SCHEER went on to say that "other people will make revolutions" and, thus, the U. S. would have to go into other countries. "If other people want communist revolutions, so be it" added SCHEER. Other speakers at this rally urged immediate withdrawal of U. S. troops from Vietnam.

October 7, 1967

The "Daily Utah Chronicle," University of Utah,
Salt Lake City, Utah, in its issue of October 6, 1967,
carried a news article entitled, "National Perspective on
Vietnam issues," which announced that a program entitled,
Spectrum Vietnam, would be held in the main ballroom of the
Union Building, Saturday, October 7, 1967, at noon. This
would be a panel discussion with CARL OGLESBY of the Students
for a Democratic Society and others. The article provided
the following background data:

"Scheer, a Political Science graduate
of City College of New York, was
appointed Maxwell Fellow in Public
Administration at Syracuse University.
Two additional years of graduate study
as a Teaching Assistant in Economics
and as a fellow in the Center for
Chinese Studies at the University of
California, Berkeley, followed. He then
taught American Government at City
College of New York.

"Mr. Scheer visited Castro's Cuba in 1960
and co-authored with Professor Maurice
Zeitlin, CUBA: TRAGEDY IN OUR HEMISPHERE.

"He was appointed foreign editor of
'Ramparts Magazine' in '65, managing
editor in '66, and vice president of
the corporation in '67.

"In spring of 1965 and again in 1966 he
traveled to Southeast Asia, touring Laos
and Vietnam. Findings of his trips were
published in the report HOW THE UNITED
STATES GOT INVOLVED IN VIETNAM.

"Scheer has been active in the New Politics
movement and is a member of the Board of the
National Committee for New Politics."

The same paper stated that at 7:00 PM, October
7, 1967, Utah Senator WALLACE F. BENNETT and GALE McGHEE,
Senator from Wyoming, would speak on Vietnam.

The "Daily Utah Chronicle," issue of October 18,
1967, carried a news article headlined, "Spectrum Chronicle
Debate," which stated that ROBERT SCHEER of "Ramparts Magazine"
was looking into the possibility of bringing a libel suit
against the "Daily Utah Chronicle" for using slanderous misquotes
attributed to him in the coverage in the Spectrum Vietnam,
October 7, 1967. This article explained that the night editor
of this paper rewrote the story at a time when he could not
contact any sources, hence the inaccuracy.

The "Deseret News", Salt Lake City, Utah, newspaper
issue of October 9, 1967, carried a news article, "Spectrum
Vietnam, Question Unresolved." This article related that ROBERT
SCHEER described as Editor of "Ramparts Magazine," attacked
the arrogant American myth that "we are always good guys
fighting on the side with angels with a monopoly on democracy,
peace and freedom."

The article said "he contended the mood of communism
is now nationalism, not world expansion and that the Communists
are now more concerned with internal problems than presenting
a united front to defeat democracy." The article added "Mr.
Scheer and Mr. Oglesby charged that the U.S. is supporting the
wrong side in Vietnam because of its economic interest. The
real issue in Vietnam and other troubled areas of the world is
poverty, according to Scheer and Oglesby.

A symposium on Vietnam was held October 7, 1967
at the University of Utah, Student Union Building Ballroom,
Salt Lake City, Utah. The panel of speakers included a senator
from Utah, a senator from Wyoming, CARL OGLESBY, former President
of Students for a Democratic Society, and ROBERT SCHEER, Editor
of Ramparts magazine. There were about 150-200 people present
at this meeting including at least seven CP members. This
function was called Spectrum - Vietnam.

Following this meeting a social party and discussion
was held at the residence of one SUE GOODRICK in Salt Lake City
on October 7, 1967.

ROBERT SCHEER was introduced as Editor of Ramparts and as spokesman for the New Left when he appeared as a guest on the LES CRANE Show on television station KTTV, Channel 11, Los Angeles, California, on October 11, 1967. SCHEER stated on this program that due to electoral procedure it would be impossible to place a candidate on the ballot - that the industralist and monied interests controlled the ballot system. SCHEER said "we" had no money and because of time and other factors, it would be impossible to obtain the thousands of names to place an eligible candidate on the ballot. He added "we" would have to take over the polls. He claimed that in order to make necessary changes in the present political structures "we" would have to "take over" the establishment in Washington.

He decried what he termed an "exploitive corrupt war economy fostered by a profiteering business community."

The article said SCHEER stated "We invoke the devil theory of communism to explain the reality of desperate social revolution." SCHEER concluded "Vietnam is only the extension of this unhealthy American character- istic, not an isolated example of mistaken policy. It is an integral part of a policy of corrupt self-seeking deception." After explaining that ROBERT SCHEER visited South Vietnam twice, the article quoted SCHEER as saying, "I think we have to realize that the Vietnamese are indeed fighting for their freedom but their freedom from us. They are nationalists trying to create a national revolution, and they can't be explained away with a label."

SCHEER alleged that the United States was in the Vietnam war to make a profit. He called for staged withdrawal of U.S. troops over a period of years.

In reference to the domestic scene, SCHEEF warned that sterner measures against dissent were coming and that President JOHNSON's talk about peace was a "con job." SCHEER said people were rioting in America because "they have no legitimate avenue of dissent." In summary, SCHEER urged concerned youth not to become complacent but to remain aware of the problems and refuse to conspire with liberal politicians who try to make dissent irrelevant SCHEER told the group, "Block the halls and block the airports. This may be one of the times when to behave reasonably is to behave irresponsibly."

The "Seattle Post Intelligencer" newspaper, Seattle, Washington, in its issue of November 22, 1967, reported that ROBERT SCHEER spoke to an overflow audience at the University of Washington, Hub Auditorium, November 21, 1967. The article stated that SCHEER said it was arrogant for Americans to decide what is best for the Vietnam people. SCHEER said it was an "obscene argument that withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam would result in a blood bath. He claimed the United States was operating on a war economy and suggested that our loss of pre-eminence in world trade as well as in jobs which rely on military contracts accounts for much of our reluctance to pull out of Asia. SCHEER predicted that 1968 may be the "last democratic election" for this nation. He predicted that the far left and the far right would grow as Americans seek alternatives. SCHEER advocated taking the billions spent on the Vietnam war and applying them to domestic problems. He alleged that unless this is done, there would be more violence and more riots in American cities.

December 8, 1967

"The Ram" newspaper of Fordham University, Bronx, New York, in its issue of December 12, 1967, carried a news article reflecting that ROBERT SCHEER gave a speech December 8, 1967 at the Fordham University Campus Center Ballroom before a crowd of 250. The article stated that SCHEER said the United States should withdraw from Vietnam and not worry about the fate of that country. In speaking about the means of demonstration, SCHEER was quoted as saying "Use your bodies imaginatively. Block railway tracks and government buildings. Violence is the only serious alternative." With regard to opposition to the war, SCHEER blamed the rowdy character of recent demonstrations which have been blocked by the economic and political power structure. He said "I support these tactics out of desperation, though I would like to see the growth of a serious left to challenge the people in power."

"BOB SCHEER, Managing Editor of Ramparts magazine, also spoke. He began with a comment on the carnival mood of the rally.

Roman Carnival

"'There is something obscene or bizarre about the Roman carnival attitude when seven people are in jail,' he commented, referring to the fact that Martha's Laundry was playing on the lower "plaza and evangelists were singing and preaching on the corner.

"'The United States is now fighting a war of examples,' he said. 'They're saying "there are certain things which we will not tolerate and we will make examples of those who attempt them," he continued.

"'And the war of examples in Vietnam has been brought home,' he added.

"He strongly emphasized the fact that the government will permit a type of false liberty so that one feels free--as long as it does not intrude on government policies.

BUCKLEY, Editor of "National Review". BUCKLEY stated ROBERT SCHEER was invited to appear on this program to explain the un-American attitude of SCHEER and also of "Ramparts" Magazine, SCHEER said he was not previously apprised of the exact topic but in any case could not speak for "Ramparts" since he is only one member of the editorial board. SCHEER then became evasive, claiming he wanted a definition of "un-American" before he could answer BUCKLEY. During this show, SCHEER stated that "National Review" Magazine had maligned SCHEER when it stated he traveled to Cuba in violation of State Department regulations and SCHEEP requested a retraction be printed. SCHEER did not state that he had traveled to CUBA illegally in 1960 and legally in 1968, but such is the case. SCHEER was very glib but was very evasive in answering BUCKLEY' questions and statements. SCHEER'S statements showed him stongly in opposition to the Vietnam war.

Television, February 23, 1968

ROBERT SCHEER was interviewed by BRANT FRAYNE and PAUL SALTZMAN at the Expo '67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in June, 1967, and the results of this interview were shown on Canadian Broadcasting Company television network on February 23, 1968. Some of the points emphasized by SCHEER in this interview are as follows:

"Ramparts" magazine, of which SCHEER is Editor, tries co be exciting and to fill a void in American life. It tries το handle the stories the other magazines do not have the guts to handle and to give some diversity of opinion in the mass media of America. It is an experiment in seeing whether American freedom and democracy really works. Other magazines are locked into the establishment because of the funding required to start a magazine and the income received from advertisers, while "Ramparts" is probably the only large circulation magazine in America that does not depend on advertising.

"Ramparts" made a decision to challenge the big magazines and to turn to a secular monthly magazine two and a half years ago (about January, 1965) and it no longer has any connection with or particular interest in the Catholic Church. It is aimed at challenging the establishment and its readers, who are primarily in the 15 to 40 year age group.

"Ramparts" has been called a muckraker and left-wing. It is on the left of the political spectrum since it opposes the war in Vietnam and is interested in removing the ghettos in American life. "Ramparts" is biased as a left-wing opposition to "Time" magazine but "Time" is biased toward the establishment and toward maintaining the status quo. "Ramparts" has never been sued for libel or had a serious challenge to its factual accuracy. "Ramparts" has a small staff of only 30 and has successfully challenged the other big magazines with extensive advertising revenue and has done a more factual reporting job on the Vietnam War, its casualties, civil rights stories and stories on such topics as the children of suburbia rebelling against suburban community and its values.

"Ramparts" magazine is largely staff produced and has nothing to offer but the guts and freedom of its reporters to report facts as they see them. "Ramparts" does not edit the reporters' articles for opinion or value of concept. These articles are only edited for size and possible emphasis for a particular issue so that there would not be four articles on Vietnam in a single issue, for instance. When "Ramparts" sends a reporter to do a story it prints what the reporter writes even though the Editor does not necessarily agree with that reporter's viewpoint.

SCHEER feels that the United States is more afflicted with an extremely biased press because in the United States we have the illusion of freedom and Americans are raised to believe that we have a free press while in fact the press is controlled through "an interlocking directorate of big business, big military and big government" that effectively manages the news so that it is not troubling or upsetting to their interests.

SCHEER believes that the honest reporting of news by "Ramparts" is doing "an awful lot of good" because a generation is being raised in the United States that knows how to be free for a change and "is not going to buy the nonsense that comes out of Washington". The youths are asking some very searching questions about American society and are not satisfied with the usual glibness so they are willing to go on marches because they do not buy these answers. This is a very large minority of youths.

Most of the American soldiers in Vietnam have been raised to believe that their country always does right and have an implicit racism. They realize that the Vietnamese do not really share United States objectives. For instance "There is a 650,000 man Vietnamese army that never does any fighting". "It is very clear that the Viet Cong has considerable support from the countryside and has done some very fine things in the countryside."

There are some cracks in the brainwashing and some disillusionment with the war in Vietnam even among American troops. More people have refused to fight and more people in the army

have taken those critical steps rather than go along with the fighting. It is not a significant number yet, but SCHEER believes it is growing. "We have to figure out whether the United States is Rome on the rise or Rome in decay and hopefully America's empire is on the verge of cracking up."

When asked if he could make a generalization about the American housewife and American married life, SCHEER stated, "The average American is drunk most of the time." SCHEER explained that the average American has a couple of drinks before starting home and several more when he arrives at home. The cocktail hour is all about getting "yourself numb enough that you can take your wife and kids and then you usually fall asleep in front of the television."

March 1, 1968

The "Albion Pleiad," Albion College weekly newspaper, Albion, Michigan, in its issue of March 1, 1968, carried an article headlined, "SCHEER Rips NORRIS, College." The article stated SCHEER was scheduled to speak on the "relevance of academe in response to cultural needs," but abandoned this topic and instead dissected the speech given by Albion College President LOUIS W. NORRIS to freshmen at this school in the fall of 1967. SCHEER said Dr. NORRIS' speech stressed the importance of vicarious learning and the central role of the "great conversation." SCHEER said the "great conversation is a bore." SCHEER stated that white middle class Americans want to make a revolution without doing anything revolutionary. SCHEER said Dr. NORRIS stated in his speech "hippies" did not belong on Albion's campus. SCHEER replied to this "with these ideas he shouldn't be president of a university, and I wouldn't have to make these statements if he hadn't given such a speech to the freshmen." He said that America can no longer engage in foreign aggression in the guise of extending freedom." SCHEER concluded his speech by stating that to alleviate these crises America should dismantle the defense apparatus, turn to a peace economy and get out of Vietnam.

One of the critics of SCHEER's speech was quoted in this article as saying, "Some of what he said was admirable, but he was so irrational and so boorish and had excruciating bad taste."

SCHEER stated "if liberals can't come up with some alternative to the prevailing political thought, the right wing is likely to do it instead." SCHEER said "our basic ideologies are going to have to be challenged if we are going to face and solve our problems." He called particularly for critical examination of the philosophies on which the United States foreign policy is based, the attitudes behind its welfare program, and the whole basis of its political system.

"Robert Scheer, 31-year-old editor of the New Left Ramparts Magazine, who flew here directly from Havana, Cuba, said our simplistic reason for intervention in Vietnam was the 'myth of the international communist conspiracy' also called the 'Devil Theory.' The Devil Theory has dis. integrated, whether our state department will admit it or not, he said.

"'This reality plavs havoc with the most cherished tenant of our foreign policy,' he said. Scheer cited the squabbling between Russia and Red China, and more recently between Czechoslovakia and Russia as evidence of the disintegration of the international con- spiracy. He said that our foreign policy should be humanistic rather than jingoistic. Americanization of the rest of the world should not be our goal, he added.

"Scheer said the United States should swallow its pride and get out of Vietnam. He said it might be good for the U.S. to lose a little face in Vietnam. Maybe it would be healthy for us to admit we made a mistake, that we can be wrong.

"The Exponent", student newspaper, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana, issue of May 17, 1968, carried a news article bearing the headline, "Ramparts Editor - War is not U.S. vs Commies." This article stated that a Vietnam symposium was held on Saturday, May 11, 1968, during which ROBERT SCHEER stated no peace or negotiations are possible unless the United States is willing to admit that the war in Vietnam is not primarily a struggle between communism and democracy." SCHEER reportedly alleged that the state department's monolithic concept of communism is the main reason that we are in that war. SCHEER stated "that the Viet Minh forerunner to the Viet Cong was a serious struggle for independence and fought the French who they considered as foreign aggressors. Both Diem and Ky, South Vietnamese leaders, worked for the French and thus the Viet Cong consider them traitors to their people. Since the U.S. supports Ky and formerly supported Diem, it was natural for the Viet Cong to fight against the U.S." SCHEER said "the U.S. should settle for something along the line of the 1954 Geneva accords to get out of Vietnam." SCHEER added that he thought it would be good for the U.S. to lose face because we have become too arrogant.

Television, June 3, 1968

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette" newspaper issue of June 4, 1968, carried an article by MIKE CULBERT, Executive Editor, which related that KTVU, Channel 2, Oakland, California, taped a television show June 3, 1968, for viewing on that station at 10:30 p.m., June 5, 1968, in which PAT MICHAELS, host, questioned ROBERT SCHEER, "A new left leader and editor of 'Ramparts' magazine" and SCOTT STANLEY, JR., "Editor of 'American Opinion' magazine, major organ of the John Birch Society." The article stated that a surprise questioner from the audience during this show was DAVID GUMAER, a 29 year old Chicagoan who infiltrated the Du Bois Clubs of America for the Chicago Police Intelligence Division and served on the registration committee of the National Convention for New Politics, which was held in Chicago, Illinois, during Labor Day weekend of 1967. The article stated GUMAER also testified before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in Executive Session in December, 1967. GUMAER stated ROBERT SCHEER was "completely surrounded by communists" at the New Politics Convention. SCHEER is reported as replying, "If you're saying I'm a communist, go ahead and say it, and I'll sue." SCHEER called GUMAER a "fink". SCHEER said he is not a communist and the communists he has known are "too conservative" for him.

August 19, 1968

The agenda for the National Student Association (NSA) Convention which was held at Kansas State University (KSU), Manhattan, Kansas, August 17-26, 1968, stated that there was scheduled a "discussion of the movement for social change in America on both a theoretical and a practical level," conducted by four individuals including ROBERT SCHEER.

An article in the August 21, 1968, issue of the "Kansas City Star" newspaper stated that TOM HAYDEN, former President of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and ROBERT SCHEER, editor of "Ramparts" Magazine, had both spoken at the NSA Convention. In this regard, the article stated "despite the militancy of their demands and aggressiveness or their charges of the JOHNSON-HUMPHREY Administration, at no time has HAYDEN or SCHEER called explicitly for violence. The printed material appearing here maintains the same guarded stance."

An article in the "Manhattan Mercury" newspaper, Manhattan, Kansas, issue of August 20, 1968, stated, "In an open forum, ROBERT SCHEER, editor of 'Ramparts' Magazine, said 'If students don't act at the (Democratic National) Convention, they must decide what their reaction is going to be when all their efforts for EUGENE MC CARTHY are swallowed up by a HUMPHREY machine. If the American people are not left with a vote against the war in Vietnam after this Convention, all the work of the students and middle class, all the efforts in the primaries, all the fund-raising will have been in vain and the Democratic process will have failed."

September 26, 1968

A meeting billed as "America as a Racist
Culture", sponsored by the Associated Students of the UCI,
was held on September 26, 1968, with about 2,000 persons in
attendance, mainly students. ROBERT SCHEER was one of the
main speakers talking on American imperialism, stating it
was exhibited through the history of this country and was
now being shown in Vietnam. SCHEER criticized the California
Board of Regents for having refused ELDRIDGE CLEAVER the
opportunity to lecture at a class at the University of
California, Berkeley, California (UCB). SCHEER defended
HUEY P. NEWTON, Founder of the Black Panther Party (BPP)
(characterization to be found in the appendix), and stated
that becuase of all of the problems there had evolved a
close coalition between the BPP and the Peace and Freedom
Party (PFP). SCHEER praised ELDRIDGE CLEAVER as the best
choice among the presidential candidates.(running on the PFP
ticket). SCHEER said this is a racist society in which we
live and the government's efforts to "control" the black man
is causing opposition to the government. He said we were
forced into the streets in Chicago and society blocked our
demands. SCHEER claimed "we must oppose that force."

At the same meeting, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, Minister of
Information of the BPP and PFP presidential candidate, also
spoke, condemning the racist pigs, the police, the courts,

"The Dartmouth", Dartmouth College daily newspaper, printed at Hanover, New Hampshire, in its issue of November 15, 1968, carried an article headlined "Scheer provides sharp contrast in symposia focus". This article reported that a senior symposium was held at Dartmouth College on November 14, 1968, with five speakers participating. The article began by quoting ROBERT SCHEER, Editor in Chief of "Ramparts" magazine, as stating "you must use the means at hand, which might mean buring your ROTC building to challenge the institution". The article said "the program climaxed with Scheer's appeal for the students of the college to assert themselves 'by challenging the institution that is manipulating your life'". SCHEER reportedly added, "the spots closest at heart are where you can best challenge the manipulators. I suggest you get busy at task". He added, "even in the woods at Dartmouth, where there aren't any girls, the elements for a confrontation exist. I told a similar group at Columbia this, but they wouldn't believe it. But look what happened". The article stated that the audience applaused loudly at the conclusion of SCHEER's plea.

## VI. WRITINGS ABOUT SCHEER

"Human Events" publication, Washington, D.C., in its
issue of April 8, 1967, carried a story headlined, "The Inside
Story of 'Ramparts' Magazine". A portion of this story,
Scheer's Radicalism, reads as follows:

"Probably the best known nationally of Ramparts'
staffers is Managing Editor Robert Scheer, who, at
30, has made a career of New Leftism. A former member
of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, he
is the most articulate of the Ramparts crew and con-
tends that he is an anti-Communist.

"Last year Scheer ran for the Democratic nomi-
nation for U. S. Congress in Berkeley, hinging his
entire campaign on getting out of the war in Viet
Nam and getting into the 'War on Poverty.' Several
weeks ago, Scheer traveled to Prague, Czechoslovakia,
to meet with the Communist-controlled International
Union of Students and representatives of the National
Liberation Front, the political arm of the Communist
Viet Cong in South Viet Nam.

"Not publicized in his race for Congress but
revealed later was the fact that Scheer's campaign
coordinator was Carl Bloice, a 28-year-old Communist
party member. Bloice's CP membership was hardly a
secret, for several years he had been a by-lined staff
writer for People's World, the Communist weekly on
the West Coast, and then he was publications director
of the Communist-controlled W.E.B. DuBois Clubs.

"From Berkeley to D.C.
At last summer's Communist party convention in New York City, Bloice was elected to the CP's National Committee and the requirements for serving on that policy board make it clear Bloice has been a CP member since at least January 1964, although intelligence agencies place it many years earlier.
Just two months ago the newsletter of the Robert Scheer campaign - he is keeping his organization intact under the name of Community for New Politics (CNP) - carried a social note: 'Carl Bloice, heretofore coordinator for CNP, has left Berkeley for the larger battlefield in Washington, D.C., where he will be a correspondent for People's World and The Worker. At a farewell party December 23 at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Scheer, Carl was presented with several going-away gifts, including a larger than life poster of Mao-Tse Tung....Carl has indicated he will be an occasional correspondent (for the Scheer newsletter).…We all wish him the best of luck in Washington and we feel fully comforted by the fact that we are not losing a coordinator, but gaining a spy.'
"Tax Money Helped
"The portrait of Mao probably brought a gust of laughter when it was unveiled and presented to the Moscow-line Bloice, and the 'gaining a spy' phrase was simply New Left humor. The story makes two important points: 1) Scheer's campaign manager was a Communist, and 2) The Capital correspondent for two Communist newspapers will contribute occasional articles to Scheer's campaign organization.
"Scheer has told Human Events that he hired Eloice 'for his technical competence'; that he likes him as a person, but violently disagrees with his politics.
"Communist Bloice, however, was only one of Scheer's supporters. Another backer was the U. S. Treasury,

which channeled funds into Scheer's campaign. It worked this way. During his campaign one of his workers was Mrs. Phyllis Haberman O'Donnell, who has been chairman of the East Bay DuBois Club. Mrs. O'Donnell worked on a work-study program directed by the University of California's Department of Criminology (which is now practically another Sociology Department) and was assigned to a leftist group called Welfare Rights Organization as a case worker. In truth, she worked for the Scheer campaign and reported on it at WRO meetings.

"The work-study program was originally funded through the Office of Economic Opportunity, receives its funds through the National Defense Education Act and is overseen by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare."

An article by IVAN SHARPE appeared in the San Francisco Bay Guardian daily newspaper published at San Francisco, California, in its issue of March 27, 1969, entitled "Ramparts - revolution with limousine service." This article reflects numerous interviews with present and former officials of Ramparts magazine and analyzes factors that led to this magazine's financial difficulties. The article places primary blame for the bankruptcy on WARREN HINCKLE and ROBERT SCHEER for their extragavant spending, such as taking their wives on trips for Ramparts and spending huge sums of money. Most of the blame was placed on WARREN HINCKLE because frequently his expense account would be more than the money he raised on promotional trips. The article gave most of the credit for the sensational stories and exposes to ROBERT SCHEER, who obtained them from his new left contacts. It reported that HINCKLE had destroyed Ramparts and SCHEER was angry about this. SCHEER decided to stay on as Editor-In-Chief of Ramparts and his salary has been reduced from $15,000 to $10,000 per year in an effort to help the magazine out of its financial problems.

AD HOC COMMITTEE TO END DISCRIMINATION

According to an article in the March 8, 1964, issue of the "San Francisco Examiner," a San Francisco daily morning newspaper, TRACY SIMS stated among other things that following a sit-in demonstration in San Francisco during October 1963 by various civil rights groups, the groups realized that a central, coordinating committee was needed. The formation of AD HOC COMMITTEE TO END DISCRIMINATION (AHCED) was the result and SIMS became its chairman.

A source reported on December 9, 1963, that in December 1963 TRACY SIMS attended a joint meeting of the San Francisco Communist Party Youth Club and the Communist Party Berkeley Off-Campus Youth Club.

A second source, on May 12, 1964, described AHCED as a central body of representatives from militant youth organizations whose purpose was to work for equal civil rights and to put pressure on establishments and employers to hire more people from the minority races, especially Negroes.

A third source reported on March 13, 1964, that at a meeting of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers Party on March 11, 1964, KIPP DAWSON, a representative of AHCED, related among other things that AHCED was directed and controlled by the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of the Bay Area.

A fourth source reported on January 30, 1964, that on January 29, 1964, KIPP DAWSON attended a San Francisco Branch membership meeting of the Socialist Workers Party.

Second source related on May 12, 1964, that the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of the Bay Area consisted of the W. E.B. DuBois Clubs of San Francisco, Berkeley, and San Francisco State College. According to source, any member of the W.E.B. DuBois Club of San Francisco who attends San Francisco State College is automatically a member of the club at San Francisco State College.

A fifth source reported on February 3, 1965, that on February 3, 1965, a press conference was held at 1365 Turk Street, San Francisco, California. At this press conference, an official of AHCED announced and passed out press releases that as of February 3, 1965, AHCED was no longer in existence.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, aka
Black Panther Party for
Self Defense

A source advised that the Black Panther Party for
Self Defense (BPPSD) was formed by HUEY PERCY NEWTON, Minister
of Defense, and BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, Chairman, in December, 1966,
as a militant black nationalist political organization to combat
police brutality, to unite militant black youth, and to
determine the destiny of black communities. The political
philosophy was taken from writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of
Communist China and black militant writers.

In March, 1968, the name of the organization was
changed to Black Panther Party (BPP).

The official BPP publication, The Black Panther
Party - Black Community News Service, states that the BPP
advocates use of guns and guerrilla tactics in their violent
revolutionary program to end oppression of black people.

On February 17, 1968, ELDRILGE CLEAVER, Minister of
Information, announced merger of the EPP and Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and bestowed title of Minister of
Justice, BPP, upon H. RAP BROWN, Chairman of SNCC.

SNCC is a militant Negro organization
which preaches black supremacy.

NEWTON, aforementioned, is incarcerated in the Alameda
County Jail, Oakland, California, awaiting trial on charge of
murder of an Oakland police officer.

Headquarters of BPP and Huey P. Newton Defense Fund
are located at 4421 Grove Street, Oakland, California.

DISCUSSION UNLIMITED, INC.

Records of the Division of Corporations, California State Department of Investments, Los Angeles, California, indicate that Discussion Unlimited filed its Articles of Incorporation as a nonprofit corporation, with the Secretary of State, Sacramento, California, on or about June 4, 1963, noting its principal site of office as Los Angeles County, California. The aims and purposes of the organization, as listed in the Articles of Incorporation, are "...to promote full and open discussion on our society and problems".

A source advised on May 8, 1963, that Discussion Unlimited, Inc. actually was originated in Los Angeles, California, in May, 1962, and was composed largely of a number of present and former Communist Party members who assist in staging panel forums and in promoting such events. Original coordinator of the group was BERNARD LUSHER, who in 1951, was educational director of the Southern California District Communist Party.

This source was recontacted on April 9, 1965, and indicated that the basic concept of Discussion Unlimited, Inc. has not changed. It continues to precent "left ideas" to at least partially non-committed audiences. It proposes to develop special activities around various issues on an irregular basis. It is not a membership organization, and does not hold regular meetings as such, but rather is strictly a forum-type organization.

On May 10, 1966, another source reported that Discussion Unlimited, Inc. continues to operate as a forum-type organization.

who consider socialism to be a visible alternative to the ills of
this society."

As of April 23, 1965, the Berkeley W.E.B. DuBois Club
was registered with the University of California as an "off-campus"

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source has advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a conference of members of the Communist Party (CP), including national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national Marxist-criented youth organization which would hunt for the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates to this meeting were cautioned against the germ of anti-Soviet and anti-CP ideologies. These delegates were also told that it would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP itself.

A second conference of over 20 persons met in Chicago on December 28-29, 1963, for the purpose of initiating a "call" to the new youth organization and planning for a founding convention to be held in June, 1964.

A second source has advised that the founding convention for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964, at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which time the name W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted. Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States attended this convention. The aims of this organization, as set forth in the preamble to the constitution, are, "It is our belief that this nation can best solve its problems in an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament and true freedom for all peoples of the world, and that these solutions will be reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic elements in our country, composed essentially of the working people allied in the unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites. We further fully recognize that the greatest threat to American democracy comes from the racist and right wing forces in coalition with the most reactionary sections of the economic power structure, using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy the unified struggle of the working people. As young people in the forces struggling for democracy, we shall actively strive to defeat these reactionary and neo-fascist elements and to achieve complete freedom and democracy for all Americans, thus enabling each individual to freely choose and build the society he would wish to live in. Through these struggles we feel the American people will realize the viability of the socialist alternative."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 123

2. 
The constitution further states that this new organization shall be a membership organization open to individuals, or if five or more people so desire, a chapter can be formed which shall in turn be guided by the policies and principles of the parent organization.

As of October, 1965, the headquarters of the DCA was located at 954 McAllister Street, San Francisco, California.

Over the Labor Day weekend, 1965, the DCA held a conference in Chicago, Illinois. According to a third source, a new slate of national officers was elected at this conference, which included Chairman HUGH STERLING FOULER, II (who, according to the third source, attended a CP cadre encampment held at Camp Midvale, New Jersey, in June, 1965, and following his election as Chairman of the DCA, attended another national CP cadre youth conference held on September 9-12, 1965, on a farm located in Northern Indiana, according to a fourth source); Director of Publicity CARL ELLENGER BLOICE (who was elected to the San Francisco County Committee CP in April, 1964, according to a fifth source); Educational Director MATTHEW "DYNAMITE" HALLINAN (who in June, 1964, was stated to be the Youth Representative on the Northern California CP District Board, according to a sixth source); Organizational Secretary TERENCE "KAYO" HALLINAN (who, according to a seventh source, met in June, 1965, with the District Staff of the Illinois CP to discuss the proposed DCA Midwest Summer Project), and Treasurer SUSAN PHYLLIS BORENSTEIN (who, according to an eighth source, has attended meetings of the Youth Club of the CP of Illinois during 1965 in connection with the DCA Summer Project).

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE,
BAY AREA CHAPTER, also known
as Bay Area Fair Play for Cuba
Committee (BAFPCC)

The "New York Times" newspaper on November 20, 1960 carried an article captioned "Pro-Castro-Body Reports U.S. Gain," which reported that the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) had 5,000 paid-up members in the United States. The article declared that the FPCC had headquarters at 799 Broadway, New York City, New York, and had chapters in other cities, including one in San Francisco.

A source advised in March, 1961, that the Bay Area Chapter of the FPCC (BAFPCC) began to be formed in San Francisco in November, 1960, under the direct guidance and leadership of ASHER HARER, who the source identified as a member of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and a member of the National Committee of the SWP.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

This source advised in March, 1963, that in the recent election of the BAFPCC the SWP continued its influence by having SWP members elected to the executive_committee.

This source advised in May, 1963, that the BAFPCC included members in San Francisco and surrounding counties. He advised that the BAFPCC has no headquarters but received mail through Post Office Box 2615, San Francisco 26, California, which is a box maintained by ASHER HARER. He stated that the announced aims and purposes of the BAFPCC are to "spread the truth about Cuba and to prevent U.S. intervention in Cuba."

A second source advised on January 10, 1964, that at a BAFPCC meeting in Berkeley, California, in December, 1963, it was decided to dissolve the BAFPCC.

for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,
Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'd.)

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin LEE H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the FPCC had been dissolved.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), as it
is known today, came into being at a founding convention held
at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962. The SDS is an association
of young people on the left and has a current program of pro-
testing the draft, promoting a campaign for youth to develop
a conscientious objector status, denouncing United States in-
tervention in the war in Vietnam and to "radically transform"
the university community, and provide for its complete control
by students. GUS HALL, General Secretary, Communist Party, USA,
when interviewed by a representative of United Press International
in San Francisco, California, on May 14, 1965, described the
SDS as a part of the "responsible left" which the Party has
"going for us." At the June, 1965 SDS National Convention, an
anti-communist proviso was removed from the SDS constitution.
In the October 7, 1966 issue of "New Left Notes," the official
publication of SDS, an SDS spokesman stated that there are some
communists in SDS and they are welcome. The National Head-
quarters of this organization as of April 18,1967, was located

SF100-46832 VIETNAM DAY COMMITTEE (VDC)

A source advised in May, 1965, that the VDC was founded in May, 1965, to organize the May 21-22, 1965, community "teach-in" on the University of California, Berkeley, California (UCB) campus.

Public literature distributed by the VDC reveals that the purpose of the VDC is to mold public opinion to force withdrawal of the United States from Vietnam, and to utilize dramatic, large-scale demonstrations in increasing public alarm about the Vietnam war.

A second source advised on June 24, 1966, that at a meeting of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers Party (SNP) in San Francisco, California, on June 22, 1966, KIPP DAWSON, whom source identified as a member of the Branch, commented, among other things, that with our help the VDC was finally recognized as a political power and was under "our control."

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

During the period from August 18, 1966 to October 7, 1966, the VDC was publicly announced as having been expelled from the UCB as a recognized on-campus organization.

A third source advised on September 29, 1966, that PETE CAMEJO was the chief spokesman for the VDC in its attempts for reinstate- ment as a recognized UCB on-campus organization. Following the re- instatement of the VDC in October, 1966, CAMEJO decided to disband the Campus Chapter of the United Committee Against War (UCAW), which he had organized to replace the VDC on the UCB campus when it was expelled. The UCAW Chapter was disbanded and the VDC subsequently became an "affiliate" of UCAW.

The third source further advised that as of September 29, 1966, the VDC was controlled and dominated by PETE CAMEJO. Source added that the VDC is no longer under the control of the old stalwarts of the original VDC and there is no continuity between the original and current VDC.

A fourth source on October 27, 1966, identified PETE CAMEJO as a current member of the SUP.

The fourth and a fifth source in September and October, 1966, identified UCA!! as an organization in the San Francisco and East Bay areas whose activities were directed toward protesting United States foreign policy in Vietnam, and is controlled and dominated by the SWP and the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA.

WOMEN FOR PEACE, aka
Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of general circulation published in Berkeley, California, contained an article in the November 19, 1965, evening edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when concern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly throughout the country and now embraces 900 groups, including Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:

(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.

(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3) Planning now at state and national levels for conversion to peace-time economy and positive efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Coordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee meetings and general meetings, as warranted, are open to all and announced in mailings to members. There are no dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and candidates for public office. On the national level the group attempts to influence government officials by letters and conferences.

A source advised on May 16, 1960, that the Bay Area Young Socialist Alliance (BAYSA) was formed in February 1958, as the Bay Area Committee for the Young Socialist (BACYS). At a later state in its development prior to adoption of the name BAYSA, the organization was known as the Bay Area Committee of the Young Socialist Alliance ("ACYSA).

The source advised that as a result of a national convention held April 15-17, 1960, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the BAYSA became a branch of the national organization to be known as the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and will carry out in the Northern California area the policies of the YSA.

## YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

The May, 1960 issue of the "Young Socialist" (YS), page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a national organization entitled "The Young Socialist Alliance" (YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue stated that this organization was formed by the nation-wide supporter clubs of the publication YS.

The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declaration of YSA. This declaration stated that the YSA recognizes the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only existing political leadership on class struggle principles, and that the supporters of the YS have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP on the principles of revolutionary socialism.

A source advised on May 23, 1966, that the original YSA was an organization formed during October, 1957, in New York City by youth of various left socialist tendencies, particularly members and followers of the SWP. The leaders of this group were the guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization.

The source further advised on May 23, 1966, that the YSA is dominated and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through having SWP members comprise exclusively the National Executive Committee (NEC). The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training section of the SWP and the main source of new SWP members.

The headquarters of the YSA are located in Room 535, 41 Union Square West, New York City.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

## EUROPE'S CRISIS; JAPAN PRAPARES

By Hansu Chen

... There are numerous American Journalists of different political color and shades of opinion who are "cooperating" in this way with Japanese imperialion, but whoever has followed the writings of Harold Isaaca, Alexander Buchman, Frank Class and Wilbur Burton in The China Press, The China Weekly Review, Asia, Pacific Affairs, Now International, etc., realizes that these American Trotskyist journalists are the most vicious and most dangerous of the whole lot of reactionery journalists.

Alding behind a barrage of Marxist phraseology (which noue of them has yet learned to manipulate with facility), those people are energetically conducting a campaign of lice against the Communist International, the Chinese Communist Party, the soviet Union, the Chinese Soviets and the Chinese Red Army, a campaign which aims to undermine the confidence of the outside world in the Chinese Soviet movement and the Red Army.

# TROTZKYITE BOOK MOURNS OVER CHINESE REVOLUTION

## THE TRAGEDY OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION. By Harold D. Issacs. Stanford University Press. 352 pp $5

**By ROBERT FRIEDMAN**

The presses are spewing forth anti-Chinese books these days at a pace which biels to match the anti-Soviet tonat. All the old 'China hands' who served Western imperialism as banker, soldier, spy, for whatever in the Orient are now busy at the typewriter, engaged in profitable vilification of 450,000,000 people because they decided to take their fate in their own hands and build for themselves.

One book which deserves, even under the cynical and opportunist reign of capitalism, some special prize for adaptability is Harold D. Isaacs' *Tragedy. of the Chinese Revolution.*

Published first in 1938 as an avowedly Trotskyite tract (complete with introduction by Trotsky) calling the defeat of the Chinese workers in 1927 a "betraval by Stalin and the Chinese Communists, the same book emerges now, refurbished, to mourn the victory of the very same Chinese workers Ja generation latert

of devious Trotskyite polemics, Isaacs book, has been reissued,. partly to cash in on the hate-China racket, arid partly because any stick is useful to Big Business against the liberation bound masses.

Isaacs now says he no longer loves Trotsky, whose introduction has been dropped as a liability. Instead, he is an open defender of imperialist intervention against the people of the Far East.

But typical of his Trotskyite weaseling is Isaacs attack on the Chinese Coimmunists of the 1920's, first because they supported Chiang Kai-shek despite the fact that he was to become the butcher of the Chinese revolution, and second because they allegedly cringed before Chiang when he turned on the workers in 1927.

This nonsense, which would rule out every political alliance in history on the chance that today's ally might he tomorrow's enemy, is ironic in view of the fact that Chiang sits today on Taiwan, a discredited gangster save only in the eyes of Isaacs' political mentors.

Meanwhile the Chinese people will go about their business building socialism, unconcerned by Isaacs' tears for the tragedy of 1927 or 1951.

Enclosure No. 1
To Des toh No. 3317
1 Ta Yong Yi Ping Hutung
Feiping, China.
Oct. 5, 1934.

Mr. T. A. Bisson
136 Claremont Avenue
Mount Vernon, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Bisson:

I have seen the correspondence exchanged between Mr. Olass and yourself regarding the contributions you collected for the China Forum. A draft for the sum in full will be sent to you this week.

I do not know in the name of whom or what Miss Smedley speaks of the China Forum. Since she was not in China at the time the Forum Suspended, nor has she corresponded with me on the subject, I consider it necessary to place before you and the other contributors an account of the circumstances in which the Forum ceased publication. Since you apparently gathered the contributors together in a meeting to hear what Miss Smedley had to say, I would appreciate it deeply if you would gather them once mors to hear my account. The enclosed is a copy of a letter, sent by me last May to the Chinese Communist Party. It has been published in China in a Chinese translation and copies have been sent abroad but has not been published in English as far as I know. I do not know the names of the people who were good enough to contribute to the Forum but their interest in the matter warrants placing before them the story of what happened to the magazine. I trust, out of simple fairness to me, you will be good enough to give them this opportunity..

I greatly regret any inconvenience or embarrassment to which you have been put in this matter. I do hope, however, that my letter will enlighten you and your friends and enable you to appreciate the difficulties which have arisen. I know of no project to revive the China Forum at the present time. Should such occur, the resultant publication would be of a considerably different character from the one I edited, as will be obvious from the facts given in my letter to the C. P. I think people who are interested in supporting the revolutionary movement here should know these facts.

Once again, I appreciate all the trouble you have gone to in this matter.

Did you ever, incidentally, receive the article "Fascism in China" and the newsletter which I mailed to July 13 last?

Yours sincerely,

(Harold R. Isaacs)

Letter of H. R. Isaacs to the C.C.P. concern-
ing the China Forum

To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

The two-year period of my extra-organizational collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party has come to an end and the China Forum which I founded and edited during that time has been forced to suspend publication. In the interest of our whole movement as well as in my personal interest, I consider it necessary to record here and publish the history of the China Forum and the circumstances of its suspension. You refused me the opportunity to lay the matter before the membership of the party even when I offered to do so in your own organs and not through the columns of the Forum. When, wrongly, I permitted the Forum to go down in silence, you turned around and in your organs and near organs in China and abroad you proceeded with the usual slanders of "betrayer" and "counter-revolutionary". In so doing you didn't have the courage or the simple honesty to state that you presented the China Forum with an ultimatum and forced its suspension because in reply its editor raised questions which are being placed before the whole movement today by the International Left Opposition. Nor did you state that you deliberately smashed the Forum for this reason despite my repeated and extended offers to continue publication as before on a straight anti-Kuomintang, anti-imperialist basis, leaving these various problems to be thrashed out first privately among ourselves. In other words, you deliberately forced suspension of the China Forum despite the fact, on your own admission, that its loss was a serious blow to the revolutionary movement in China, that it meant the disappearance of an organ which for two years you had considered an extremely valuable instrument in the hands of the movement. Here, as in the broader issues which led to our differences, your blind adherence to false policies was once more demonstrative of your readiness to place your factional interests above the interests of the Chinese Revolution.

In going back over the history of the Forum, I think the vicious character of your action becomes even more evident when I start with the fact that from beginning to end I functioned not as a member of the party but as a willing sympathizer who was prepared to throw all his energies into a job he saw he could do - edit and publish an organ in China which could help mobilise the forces of this country for struggle against the Kuomintang and the imperialists by exposing the regime of terror and privation which they have in common imposed upon the masses of the Chinese people. Permit me to recall at this point that I never accepted any personal remuneration for time or labor. You gave the Forum financial aid but I never received a dollar from you that was not put into the paper. I refused your offers of compensation and earned my living elsewhere. Your only claim on me was my full-hearted loyalty to the Communist ideal and our


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

-2-

our common dedication to the struggle against a regime
of hate and misery and oppression. In the end you for-
folted this claim by ceasing any longer to be in my eyes
honest or.effective leaders of this struggle.

Although you helped the Forum financially, the part
you played in building it up from the day it started in
January, 1932, to the day of its last appearance in Janu-
ary 1934, was insignificant. My repeated requests for
cooperation in matters of circulation and material for
publication went largely unsatisfied throughout that time.
You never supplied me with the reports I so frequently
and urgently sought, particularly on trade unione, strike
struggles, the Red Armies, the Red districts, etc. Every-
thing thơ Forum did and became was the fruit of the work
of a tiny group of devoted collaborators (the most im-
portant of whom had no connection with you whatever) and
myself who had to depend almost entirely on our own re-
sources for everything we did and published. At every
crisis in the Forum's existence, when it was banned by
the French authorities in Shanghai at the very outset;
when it was hounded and persecuted by the American and
Chinese authorities in the summer of 1933, when through
British police pressure it was thrown out of every avail-
able printing ship in the city; when the pseudo-Fascist
Blue Shirts again and again threatened the printing plant
which I built up partially through personally contracted
loans it was invariably through my own initiative, with
the help of the little Forum staff, that we pulled our-
selves up by the bootstraps every time and carried on to
a point in January this year where the Forum was flourish-
ing and growing daily in circulation, prestige, and in-
fluence despite the many formidable obstacles in its way.
The formation of the China Forum Readers Association,
which in the brief space of three months spread to eleven
cities in five provinces, developing into & mighty poten
tial weapon for the revolutionary movement, was the prod-
uct of spontaneous action on the part of the Forum's
readers, later sponsored and led by the paper itself.
All these were the Forum's own achievements, not yours.
By your arbitrary and criminal action you shattered then
in the full stride of their growth. Because to my bitter
disappointment I had not nor could I secure the resources
to carry on myself - owing largely to the difficult condi-
tions of work and the impossibility of getting revenue
from the paper itself - all that had been achieved and
was to be achieved was ground into the dust.

II.

From almost the very beginning of my active work -
which I date from the time I began reporting events in
China in a Communist way - a number of questions presented
themselves to me in increasingly forcible form. These
arose originally from my discovery of the gross distor-
tions and exaggerations which I found to be characteristic
of Communist propaganda in China and abroad. I defino
propaganda as the skilful, clear, accurate and wholly
truthful reporting of the facts linked to an incisive,

purposive


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

-3-

purposive interpretation and a plan of action for dealing with the facts in a revolutionary way. I learned 06:04 no sie and work of Lenin and his Bolshevik comrades who taught us that the truth comes from the masees themselves and that only dienster can result from telling them lies. I have never learned to the contrary that it was my revolutionary duty to work in any other way although I soon found that the present day Communist Party press makes a practice of distinguishing between propaganda and truth.

Examples of exaggeration and distortion most strik-ing to we were naturally those which applied to China, bocause here I could check allegations with known facts. I first wrote these down to the ignorance or incapacity of individuals. I felt that Communist editors abroad would publish accurate facts about China if they could get them. Accordingly with a friend I tried to set up. an independent mail news service and sent weekly bulletins to papers all over the world giving brief, sharp, factual accounts of what was going on. This was in the fall of 1931 after my return from the area of the great Central China floods of that summer. I scarcely understood then why this service failed to secure any response from the Communist press abroad. After about three months I had to suspend it for lack of support. It simply didn't get published except in a few organs which were not official Communist Party papers, including the New York Militant.

It wasn't long before I began to perceive, with a deeper study of international events and the history of the Chinese Revolution, that a consistent thread ran through the distortions and exaggerations which I found not only in brief casual reports of current events but in the solemn pronunciamentoes. made by delegates before plenums of the E.C.C.I. I discovered that these departures from the truth were made necessary by the official premise that ever since the catastrophe of 1937 a mighty, upsurg-ing revolutionary movement has been marching forward in China to the very brink of seizure of power under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. I discovered that these exaggerations were necessary because the prem-ise vas false and along with it all the basic tenets of the policies being pursued by the Communist International and the Communist Party in China. I cannot begin here to give a summary of some of these distortions (which I verbally cited to you by the dozen) ranging from particu-lar incidents (the wilfully false picture given of the cotton mill strike in Shanghai in January, 1933, even to the point of transposing it to February to heighten the lapression given of the workers' role in the Shanghai war) to high flown generalisations like the statement recently made before the Plenum of the S.C.C.I. that the C.C.P. has won over the majority of the Chinese working class and the peasantry.

In denying the factual truth of this premise, whence flows the whole policy of the Communist Party in China, I deprecate not a whit the magnificent militancy and courage of Chinese workers, striking again and again and fighting

against


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

against terrific odds in defense of their very lives;
nor the noroio struggles waged by peasants all over the
country; nor the fight of the Red Armies against the
Kuomintang, I merely respect the cold, indisputable fact
that these struggles are defensive, not offensive, that
they are isolated, desperate and unorganised. With very
few exceptions - a few small strikes here and there and
the larger exception of the Red Army - they are without
organized revolutionary leadership. Moreover the develop-
ment of this leadership, the task of the C.P., is proceed-
ing at a tragically retarded pace owing to the false
policies and inept tactics of the party.

In denying the presence of a mighty revolutionary
upsurge (1.6., a vast, organised march toward the seizure
of power) I respect facts made still clearer perhaps when
compared to the facts and figures of the monster mass move-
ments of the 1925-27 period. The tragic errors of the
Communist leadership in 1987 were primarily responsible
for the decapitation of that great movement and because
no lessons have been drawn from those evente to this very
day, these errore, monstrously accumulated, are still re-
sponsible for the tragedies of today. But for the purpoве
of our comparison here, let us for examplo take the single
fact that in 1936 in Greater Shanghai there were 257
strikes. In 1933 there were 82. Let us remember that
on the eve of the workers' seizure of power in Shanghai
in March, 1937, there were more than 800,000 workere,
handicraftsmen and petty traders out on the streets fight-
ing with arms in hands for demande of a far-reaching pos,
litical character. A close check for the entire country
in the latter half of 1933 showed me that less than one-
thirtieth of that number were engaged in strikes and other
disputes during any given month and that almost invariably
the demands were defensive demands against wage cuts and
lockouts. Moreover, the lack of cohesive leadership -
often in departments of the same factory or in one or more
of a group of factories - or even sometimes lack of even
the most elementary organization has in almost every
case led to deadening failure and relatively easy betrayal
by the yellow "labor leaders" and "mediators of the
Xuomintang. In 1935 the shooting of thirteen students.
by British police in Shanghai was the touch-off for a
general strike which paralyzed the city and which was
Beconded by vast sympathy strikes which broke like a
series of tidal waves over the entire country. In Janu-
ary, 1932, when the Japanese imperialists used the Shanghai
International Settlement as a base for operations which
cost the lives of tens of thousands of Chinese, not a
single strike interrupted the normal course of the pub-
lic or other services in that settlement. In the factories
there were no strikes but a large scale lockout to which
the overwhelming majority of Shanghai's workers submitted
without protest.

The dogged, persistent struggle carried on by small
sections of the rank and file workers in isolated instances
in recent years is tribute to the magnificent fibre of
Chinese


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

Chinese workers. It is not evidence that a revolutionary
seizure of power is on the order of the day. It is evi-
dence, along with the heroto sacrifices of thousands who
have lost lives and liberty in Chinese revolutionary
struggle during the last seven years of Kuomintang re-
action, that it is possible to fight the monstrous white
terror which Chinese Communists frecuently cite as a
reason for the insufficiency of their work. Yet, it is
largely because this terror has not been fought effectively
that the Kuomintang regime, despite the fact that it is
rotting and crumbling, can still keep the lid down on the
boiling, simmering hatred of the people it rules. Unless
the martyrdom of thousands of China's finest workers,
peasants and revolutionary intellectuals is to be in vain,
we must turn resolutely away from the folly of calling to
insurrection when what is needed is painstaking education,
organization and the sponsorship of day-to-day struggles
of the masses for democratic demands, the slow building up
of a party and mase organizations and a movement which
will be able to command the forces capable of carrying out
an insurrection.

In the case of the widespread but isolated and in-
dividual cases of peasant uprisings, and this includes
the Red Armies in Kiangsi, these struggles await the
leadership of a strong working class movement before they
can have a successful issue. The Red Armies in their re-
stricted and surrounded areas and with their meagre re-
sources have fought heroically against the Kuomintang
attacks upon them. But until the Kuomintang is shaken
from its bulwarks in the imperialist controlled working
class centres, their prospect of revolutionary triumph
remains necessarily dim. No revolutionary purpose is
served by taking refuge in the fiction that these armies
have proletarian leadership because individual workers,
undoubtedly leaders of superior quality and courage, have
been torn from their factories and their fellow-workere
and sent down to occupy key positions in the Red Army
districts and in the Red Armies themselves. Indeed, this
common practice of extracting the most conscious and pro-
gressive working class elements from their working olass
environment and sending them down to the Red districts is
a good index to the oriminal transposition of emphasis
which has helped paralyze the working class movement in
the cities. If the White Terror doesn't carry off the
workers' leaders as they arise, the C.P. does and has done
so in hundreds of cases. This helps in no small part to
explain why it has also been impossible to mobilize a
genuine mass anti-Japanese movement in the fact of mili-
tary aggression and why the White Terror of the Kuomin-
tang has succeeded, by filling mass graves and innumer-
able prisons with the martyred dead and living, in down-
ing the anti-imperialist movement or efforts toward the
organization of such a movement and paving the way for
the ever increasing encroachments of the imperialists.
The party has not yet gripped and directed the deep and
bitter and often inarticulate hatred of the masses of the
people for their oppressors and this includes large seо-
tions of the lower netty bourgeoisie who could be won by
successful mass pressure from below. This is because the

Party


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

-6-

Party has failed to translate the realities of everyday events into its program and tactics.

I cannot here go into the many-faceted problems and issues which flow from these facts with regard to the policies and tactics of the Chinese revolutionary movement. Nor extending to the international scene need I go into the terrific effects of the German catastrophe nor the storm of questions which has been directed at the C.I. leadership whose responsibility in the disaster has become nakedly clear to unnumbered Communists and Communist sympathizers the world over. Nor into the whole set of implications which arise from the policies of the C.I., with particular reference to the late developments in Soviet foreign policy, the Litvinov-Roosevelt agreement, the forthcoming mooted entrance of the U.S.S.R. into the League of Nations and in a smaller but equally character istio way, the forthcoming association of the U.S.S.R. with the Institute of Pacifio Relations which hopes to höld ita next talkfest in Mo৪০০৯. These problems, with their many specific links to the Chinese questions, were the basic questions over which I soon began to take issue with the official views of the Party and the International.

III.

But precisely because at all costs I desired to carry on the Forum's oven struggle against the common enemy - against the Kuomintang and the imperialists - I sedulously avoided bringing these issues into the columns of the paper, increasingly against my better judgment. I leaned over far backward in this respect. This expressed itself in many of the current issues with which we had to deal.

I ask you to recall the whole uphill fight which the Forum waged on behalf of Paul and Gertrud Ruegg in the spring and summer of 1933 during which time I repeatedly warned against the emphasis which was being placed on the legal aspects of the case and the negotiations with the Kuomintang to the detriment of mass pressure and the capitalization of the case for political purposes. You paid lip service to the need for mass pressure - partiou- larly here in China- but in fact the "legalities" and futile negotiations remained the major pillars of the de- Tense. Until in the very end I finally rebelled, I wasn't even permitted to give Ruegy his honourable and rightful title secretary of the Pan Pacific Trade Union Secre- tariat. Yet, although I felt the struggle for the Ruegga was being seriously handicapped by the tactics being pur- sued, I carried on the fight with all the energy at my command and you will recall that it was I who created the local defense committee and was chiefly responsible for the widespread press propaganda and the considerable sympathy which we aroused. Yet the strictly non-political attitude which Ruegg was forced to assume at the trial (in contrast to the highly political atitude of his prosecutors) was in my opinion one of the major reasons for


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

-7-

for the fate to which he and his wife were condemned.

I ask you to recall the whole period of the organisa-
tion and activities of the China-League for Civil Rights,
from December, 1933, to June, 1933, in which I took an
notive part. I gave full play to this hybrid League and
its work without once publishing the basic criticisms
which I often voiced to you and which in the end were
wholly confirmed by what happened after the Kuomintang
murdered Yang Chien in June that year.

I ask you to recall the views I set forth in August
and Sentember, 1933, on the subject of the "anti-War Con-
gress" which at your specific request I did not publish.
Instead, to my regret, I published the foul rot of Mar-
ley & Co., without freely giving play to the true facts
about that farcioal junket which had convinced me that
the policies which gave it birth do not one single whit
advance the international struggle against imperialist
war.

On one occasion and this at least I can take com-
fort in I passively resisted when you requested me to
write and publish a slanderous attack on Chen-Tu-holu
when he was condemned to 13 years imprisonment by the
Kuomintang. Your request was specific. I was not to
deal with the issues which had brought Chen Tu-hsiu from
being the leader of the C.P. in 1927 to being leader of
the Chinese Opposition in 1933. I was only to string to-
gether a vile series of labels in an effort to explain
why the Kuomintang even imprisoned the leader of the
Left Opposition. As you know, that attack was never
written or published.

Again in December, 1933, upon my return from Fukien,
you specifically demanded that I set aside the results of
my own personal investigations in Foochow in order to
write on your behalf (but over my signature!) an utterly
baseless and slanderous attack on the Left Opposition.
You will recall that you charged at that time that the
Trotskyists were prominently identified with the new
government set up in Fukien by Chen Ming-shu and Taal
Ting-kal. You lumped the Left Opposition with the Third
Party and the so-called Social Democrats among the petty
bourgeois satellites of the Fukien militarists. It was
as much to satisfy myself on this very point as to per-
form a mission for you that I went down to Foochow and
spent two weeks there and learned through direct contact
with dozens of people prominently concerned that the Left
Opposition were stoutly and clearly opposed to the Foochow
regime. I haven't place bare to discuss the relations of
the C.P. to the short-lived Fukien Government or the char-
acter of the "negotiations which were going on down there..
The important thing here is that on my return you demanded
that I write clanders which flew in the face of everything
I myself had learned. It is interesting, as a sidelight
on your methods in factional strife as you conceive it,
that your representative in Poochow sent back a report,
through me, ironically enough, that one of the most prom-
inent of the youthful pseudo-radicale in Foochow, Bu

Chi-yuen


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

-8-

Chi-yuen to be exact, was a leading "Trotskyist". It so happened that I met and had several lengthy interviews with Hu and by the time I left Foochow I understood his position and his personality exceedingly well. He was as much a Trotskyist as Mei Lan-fang is! Yet you actually demanded that I ignore my own knowledge of the man and in my article on Fukien set him down as a "Trotskyist". I was faced on the one hand by your demands that I write falsehoods to suit your policies and on the other by my deep desire to set forth the actual facts about the Opposition's attitude towards the Fukien regime. But once more, to preserve the shreds of our relationship, I drove a middle course and did neither, leaving the whole question out of my article.

Despite the facts that these issues weighed more and more heavily upon me, despite the fact that events in China and abroad were pressing themselves sore and more imperatively on the concerns of every sincere revolutionary, I still tried to keep the Forum balanced on its ribbon-like path, concentrating on the anti-Kuomintang, anti-imperialist struggle, and in so doing fulfilling at least a partial function as a revolutionary organ. I deeply felt, however, that I was betraying my readers by avoiding these issues. How could I write of Germany and avoid all the implications of that disaster? How could I write of America's recognition of the U.S.S.R. and still fail to say that the Communist International had virtually been murdered at Washington? How could I warn against the dangers of imperialist intervention in the U.S.S.R. and still not point out that Soviet foreign policy was in fact daily heightening the danger of such intervention? Yet I somehow did so and sought in whatever way possible to retain some basis for our continued collaboration.

IV.

Nevertheless, abruptly in January of this year you forced an ultimatum upon me and subsequently forced the break in our relationship because I could not and would not, at your demand, devote the China Forum to policies which I could not and do not believe compatible with the interests of the Chinese Revolution and the international proletarian revolution. I could not, at your demand, set aside the convictions to which I had literally been driven by the stinging lash of catastrophic events in China, Germany and the world over. Particularly my deep interest in Chinese events during the last three years made it impossible for me, finally, to give active support to policies and tactics whose disastrous effects were being a thousandfold confirmed for me by the tragic events of every swiftly-passing day. I could not ignore questions which strike at the roots of our work and the whole structure of our hopes for a revolutionary future.

Despite the fact that these questions are rocking the entire International today, you denied my right to

raise them in print. You demanded more. You demanded
that I attack anybody who did so - primarily the people
you call "counter-revolutionary Trotskyists" the only
people who are facing these problems today in a fearless,
revolutionary way. You demanded that the China Forum
become a stereotype for the policies and vulgar faction-
al slanders which I could neither then nor now be party
to. In reply to my questions on China you simply quoted
back to me the lies and half-lies I've been so used to
reading in Inprecorr. You even declared: "For propa-
ganda purposes a certain amount of exaggeration is neces-
sary... and went on amasingly to say: "but we know the
true facts and we base our policies on them, not on these
exaggerations! A new slant on modern-day C.I. tactics!
Facts, you said, are curious things. They have to be
turned around and around and around and examined closely
until their true nature becomes apparent. The trouble 18
you turn them so far and so quickly that they turn into
something like a dizzily turning top of fancy - or at
best wish - fulfilling misrepresentations.

To my questions on Germany you quoted Heckert,
Piatnitsky, and the E.C.C.I.'s famour resolution declar-
ing that the collapse of the German party and the slaughter
of the German workers were based on the past, present and
future correct policies of the C.P.O.! You declared I had
no right to offer critical comment on the dangerously
opportunistic foreign and domestic policies of the U.S.S.R.,
most notably on the entry of the U.S.S.R. on a straight
nationalist basis into the disgusting corridors of im-
perialist intrigue. To the contrary, I was to lovingly
fawningly fondle and hail the policies which have meant
disaster in China, Germany and elsewhere and are rapidly
leading the U.3.3.R. into the vacuum of nationalist is00
lation from the world wide proletarian movement. This I
was to do, to begin with, by publishing Stalin's face on
the front page and columns of the customary panegyrics
to his infallibility. Above all and before all, I was to
take un cudgels against "counter-revolutionary Trotskyism".
That was to be the main point of my reformation - to raise
no questions myself and slander anybody else who did so.

In reply to your demand that I submit to an editorial
board in order that these editorial policies should be.
effectively put into practice, I offered (1) to continue
publication strictly as before, meanwhile arguing out my
differences with you in discussions on the side; (2) to
throw the columns of the Forum open to a general discus-
sion of all basic revolutionary question, with free play
to unorthodox as well as orthodox views. If your views
were correct, I argued, it would be a distinct advantage
to you to have such an opportunity to display their br11-
liance alongside the puny efforts of your critios; (3) to
publish orthodox news and views but to reserve for myself
the right to comment and criticise.

These repeated offers you repeatedly refused. You
offered to discuss these questions with me verbally if in

the seanwhile I throw the Forum oven to your editorial
board. My other proposals were unthinkable! Give the
Foria's readers a chance to hear counter-revolutionary"
viewcoints? Never that! I could only display my revo-
lutionary purity by acceding to your demands. We would
talk things over until Spring, then if all went well (1.e.,
if I showed a satisfactory adaptability to your view-
point) I could pack up for an educational trip to the
Soviet Union where I would certainly become convinced
of the error of my ways. In other words you wanted my
signature on a promissory note with the amount left
blank for you to fill in. You put this in the form of
an ultimatum and you told me that if I did anything but
accept I would forthwith enter the camp of the "counter-
revolution".

I had to refuse these terms. I had to refuse to
lend myself to a slanderous and baseless struggle against-
the International Left Opposition. I had to refuse to
lend space to the nauseatingly fawning praise of Stalin
and uncritical reception of Stalinist policies which
characterise the Communist Party press the world over.
I had to refuse to take shelter in the cold and draughty
empty spaces which stretch behind the impressive facade
and early tradition of the Communist International. I
would like to go to the Soviet Union for a vist someday -
but I had to refuse your offer on your terms. I had to
refuse, in short, to become a hack prostitute in the name
of the Revolution.

In the end, too, I had to refuse to turn over to you
the printing plant I had built up with so much pain and
struggle because I considered it not your property but
the property of the working class movement. Because I
could not carry on the Forum myself, for lack of finan-
cial resources and because of heavy debts contracted, I
disposed of the plant and turned every farthing of the
proceeds over to where I now consider the true interests
of our movement lie. It was with a deep and abiding bit
terness that I had considered comrades, when for two years
it had fought off all its many enemies on the outside.

Yet with it came the realisation that we have to
build anew over the ruine you have wrought. The revolu-
tion and the building of our future moves forward and
when we trample down the defenses of our enemies we shall
crush underfoot everything and everybody that stands in
our way. No sycophantic, blind allegiance to a name, an
empty facade, a torn and shredded prestige can lead us
forward. Only unswerving fidelity to our goal and active
struggle towards this end with the weapons of a correct
and tested political line will lift us from defeat to ul-
timate victory. To this struggle I shall continue to
dedicate all my energies.

MEMORANDUM.

sith reference to R.A. memorandum No. 1305 of December 4, 1931, regarding Harold ISAACS and his connection with Silaire NCULENG, it has just been learned that one Viola ROBINSON arrived in Shanghai on August 28, 1932, by the C.... S.S. MASS OF ASIA. On August 29, Miss ROBINSON, together bith Harold ISAACS of the CHINA FORUM, gave notice to the United States Consulate General of their intended marriage, which actually took place on the 14th September. In his marriage application, ISAACS particularly requested that no publicity be given to the forthcoming ceremony. It appears that Miss ROBINSON is a follower of the suffragette, Lucy STONE, who, some fifteen or twenty years ago, advocated among American women the retention of the maiden name after marriage. According to officials of the United States Consulate General, Viola ROBINSON, therefore, will not be known as Mrs. ISAACS.

In connection aith Viola ROBINSON's activities in China, in a letter, dated Szechuen, July 24, 1931, Harold ISAACS wrote to Viola ROBINSON as follows:

> "You are in the swim, Viola. I'm coming back to dive in and swim alongside. That do you think? It is all extremely fortuitous from our standpoint that I should have seen the light at last. Your work with UGG and the future in it is far more important than anything you could do out here or anywhere else for that matter. I'll get back - no matter a possible delay - no matter how - there will be a job to be done and by our gods I'm going to get into it..."

Attention is called to the name UGG mentioned in the above extract.

American Consulate General,
Shanghai, China, December 10, 1931.

Subject: Harold H. Isaacs.

THE HONORABLE

THE SECRETARY OF STATE,

WASHINGTON,

Sir:

I have the honor to report that an American citizen named Harold R. Isaacs has been reported to this office by the police of the International Settlement as a communist suspect. The facts regarding Mr. Isaacs are briefly as follows:

Mr. Harold R. Isaacs called at this office in December, 1930, and stated that he would be for a few months in Shanghai; at that time he exhibited passport No. 177026, issued by the Department of State on March 17, 1930. He stated that he expected to leave Shanghai in June, 1931; that his home was in New York City and that his local address was in care of the American Express Company.

According to Police reports Isaacs arrived in Shanghai from Manila as a first-class passenger on the S. S. PRESIDENT JEFFERSON on December 17, 1930. He was employed by the SHANGHAI EVENING POST AND MERCURY and later by the CHINA PRESS but apparently lost both positions.

positions. He has resided with a British subject named C. Frank Gluss at 129 Hothaiwel Road and made a trip with Class to Srochuen during June, 1931. The police file contains a copy of a letter written by him to a Miss Viola Robinson, cure of the American Consulato, Dresden, Germany, dated July 24, 1931, at Chongtu, Szoshuen. This lotter, it is stated, was roturne! unoponed to Shanghai frem Dresden, addressed to Nerold R. Isaacs in care of the American Express Company, Shanghai, and was opened by the Post Office Consor at the request of tho Commissioner of Fosts. The letter is very long and shows that Icasos, although previously holding com- munistic vious, only decided definitely to turn "Red" during July of this year. He states that he was in- fluenced in this decision by certain converentions with 0. Frank Glass, above referred to, during their trip to Szoohuen.

In conncetion therewith it may be of interest to state that according to a police report dated cotobor 17, 1931, information regarding this letter was given by the Shangai Municipal Police to an officer of the local British Consulate Coneral, who apparently sadlad information regarding it to London. The police report otates that a reply was subsequently receive the glet of which is as follows!

The police state that this address was formerly known as Number 25 Avenue Dubail and is the boarding house at which Agnes Smedley resided from May, 1929, to May 1930. The police report that Agnes Smedley frequently visits Isaacs and Glass at this address.

In my monthly political report for November, on page 15 it was stated that the bodies of numerous members of the family of a certain Kou had been murdered, allegedly by communists in retaliation for Kou's turning traitor to the communist cause. In connection with this matter Isaacs addressed an open letter to the various newspapers of Shanghai, under date of November 24, 1931, in which he scored them for branding those alleged murders as "horrible" and "dastardly," while at the same time they did not raise their editorial voices against the whole-sale murders committed by Chiang Kai-shek, the Garrison Commander of Shanghai and other Chinese militarists. None of the papers saw fit to publish this letter but I[^1] have received a copy thereof, and copies are enclosed.

COPY

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS OF SHANGHAI

Your publication of the "ghastly" (Shanghai Times),
"horrible" (China Press), "ghastardly" ("vening Post and
North China Daily News) murders allegedly committed by
Chinese Communists in the French Concession brings
forcibly to mind certain other aspects of the Chinese
scene whose chastliness and barbarity find their way
into your columns only at rare intervals - and then
only in brief cool paragraphs.

There can be no attempt to "justify" these alleged
murders, if the tale be true. We all hate the guts of a
traitor. But we cannot all condone a system of vendetta
which exacts as the price of betrayal the innocent lives
of a traitor's family. That, however, involves the
question of differing social customs to which no abstract
moral a solute can possibly be applied.

Betrayal has its price under any social norm,
whether we turn the dirty work of vengeance over to the
ineffable mercies of the Lord or employ the less aesthetic
but more effective instruments of the gallows, electric
chair, lethal chamber, the guillotine or the more refined
weapons of social ostracism; whether we consider the
traitor himself responsible for his actions - or exacts
retribution from his blood relations as well. (Jehovah,
too, visits the sins of the father upon his children,
yea, even unto the third and fourth generations!)

But you reporters, whose typewriters quivered
with the horror of these alleged deeds of murder in
Frenchtown can still without a qualm condone and even
express satisfaction at mass murders a thousand times
more revolting, a thousand times more barbarous - but
less so in your journalistically judicious eyes only
because officially perpetrated.

You city editors - at the moment sending your men
out to run down the last threaded folds to this particular
story - why don't you send them out to Lunghua come fine
sunny morning? Why don't you give them an opportunity
to witness the torture and murder of young men and women
whose only crime is a realistic appreciation of the
social and economic factors at work in the world and
a demand for their readjustment?

You editors, who wield your editorial powers so
self-righteously, why don't you consistently examine and
logically expose a government that maintains itself
largely by desperately slaughtering the flower of its
protesting youth and the backbone of its peasant masses
who attempt protest against its venality and corruption?

On any principles of abstract Justice, is the cass murder of thousands by the machine gun, the homber, the rifle, the word, the axe any more just than the furtive strangulation of nine hopeless relatives of a polf-branded yellow cur? This perpetual mrfare has bean waged on the protext of suppressing "banditry." If this be 20, we are confrontal with the startling fact, vouchel for and advertised by the government boasting the recognition of all foreign powers, that vast portions of the Chinese population are oriminal: on tis promise, Chiang Kai Shok & Co. backed by the cohorts of the Soong Lonage sucop down on whole provinces, massacre thousands, take heavy tolls from the nougro life earnings of peaconte and workers. And with all their guns and planes and hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they still fail to eradicate the "bandits."

Who are the bandits, the robbers, the murderers? Answer this question, Kosers. Editors - and answer 18 honestly if you dare!

## EDITOR OF CHINA PAPER IN DANGER

### Threat to Turn Isaacs Over to Nanking

BRANGKAI, Aug. 2.-The Wall Btreet government, supporting its Nanking butcher agents, has threat. ened to turn over Harold R. Isaacs, American editor of the "China Forum," te the Nanking hangmen.

As editor of the 'China Forum," Isaacs has committed the crime against Imperialism of supporting tho Chinese Revolution and ruthless- ly exposing the mass murder of rov olutionary Chinese workers and peas- ants by the Nanking regime and the United Blates and other imperialist: brigands. He has exposed the shame- ful sell-out of the Chinese masses. by the Nanking traitors to the Jap- anese, American and other imperial-;
Iste.

The United States government has warned Isaacs that it will withdraw the protection of extra-territorial rights unless the "China Forum" changes ita editorial and news pol- icies. Under the extra-territoriality traatles imposed upon China by the imperialists, American and other citi sens of the imperilaist powers may not be tried in the Chinese courts. Because Isaacs is an American..citl- zen the Nanking government has not been able to wreack its vengeance on him for his exposure of thetr bloody. terror and betrayal of the Chinese masses. The Wall Street Govern ment, which protects its business agents looting China now proposes to throw Isaacs to its Nanking lack- eys for trial in the Chinese courts on charges carrying life imprison- ment or the death penalty.

Isaaca has categorically refused to concede to the demands of the United States government that he change the policies of the "China Forum." Ha is closely associated in the anti imperialist, anti-Kuomintang fight wit's Madame Sun Yat-sen, who tá chiarmen of the committee wading the fight to save Paul and Gertrude Rueggs from a death sentence in the Chincze courts.

American workers and intellectuals and their organizations should at once zend vigorous protest to the State Department at Washington arts attempt tocad Isaacs to death in the Nanking Courts

direct to Paris for three or four days before proceeding to London. His visit to Paris is, therefore, strictly unofficial.

## FRANCE

A correspondent asked if the French Government had asked the State Department for an agrément for a new Ambassador in Washington, M. Germaine-Martin. Mr. Rogers replied in the negative.

## CHINA

A correspondent asked if Representative La Guardia of New York had asked the State Department to intervene in the case of an American named Harold Isaacs who is now editing a newspaper in China, which, according to press despatches, is a Communist organ. The correspondent continued by saying that according to stories the American diplomatic officers in China warned Mr. Isaacs that he would be likely to lose his extratorritorial status because of his activities. Furthermore, his father, who is in New York, wants the Department of State to get Mr. Harold Isaacs back and have him deported. In reply, Mr. Rogers said that he knew nothing of any communication from Mr. La Guardia on the subject. In regard to the story, it is not true that this Government has threatened to deprive Mr. Isaacs of his extraterritorial rights in Shanghai.

## BOLIVIA-PARAGUAY

A correspondent asked if the State Department had received any reports to the effect that the Boliviens had captured two Paraguayan forts. In reply, Mr. Rogers said that he understood that Assistant Secretary White talked with the correspondents last night concerning the situation and that Mr. White might possibly be able to see the correspondents again today.

SUBJECT: ISOLOG/WUSPARROW/Operational
Dr. Harold R. ISAACS, Professor of Political Science at N.I.T.

1.  On 12 July 1967, WUSPARROW/1 renewed his old friendship with Subject at the MIT Faculty Club. Subject is now a senior research associate at MIT's Center for International Studies and has recently been named a Professor.

2.  For the past few years Subject has been working on an international study series involving minority racial groups. His reports have been published in the *New Yorker* magazine and as books, *The New World of Negro Americans* and *India's Untouchables*. Subject plans to publish in August 1967 a book on the *American Jews in Israel* and is working on another on the Philippines.

3.  WUSPARROW/1 first met Subject in 1946 after he had just completed a long and friendly interview with Ho Chi Minh as Far East correspondent for *Newsweek*. At that time, Subject felt that the United States was making a mistake in not accepting Ho as the leader of a united Vietnam, feeling that Ho was independent enough of China to make him at worst a sort of Tito.

4.  Subject presently is despairing of United States foreign relations in that our people from Washington, or elsewhere, seldom seem to establish a deep rapport with Asian or African nationals. Subject feels that such relations as do exist never reach more than an ineffective superficial level.

5.  Subject first went to the Far East about 1930 when he was a crew member of the Matson Line's Malolo and disembarked at Honolulu to work for the Honolulu Advertiser. (WUSPARROW/1 went to work for the same paper two years later.) Subject went next to the Philippines where he worked on a Manila daily. While in Manila he was offered the editorship of the Bangkok Royal Mail, to fill in for St. Clair McELWAY, now of the New Yorker.

6. Subject's mind was set on China and in late 1931 he went to Shanghai and joined The China Press, working alongside Tiliman DURDIN, now of the New York Times. Subject lost his job with The China Press after a flare-up with Hollington TONG, part-owner of the paper. Subject then joined the Newsweek foreign staff. Subject was in and out of Bangkok after World War II and WUSPARROW/1 became friendly with him. According to WUSPARROW/1, many people regard Subject's *Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution* as a significant work and a recent writer on China, Dennis BLOODWORTH, holds a good view of Subject's *Scratches on the Mind*.

7. Subject now seems permanently settled with MIT, having bought a home at 96 Farlow Road, Newton. Subject hosts there at pool-side "seminars" on Saturday afternoons, with MIT faculty friends and journalist friends such as Bob SHAPLEN coming by. Subject invited WUSPARROW/1 to participate as well.

8. However, as WUSPARROW/1 ascertained, Subject has little contact with foreign students save for an occasional adult foreign graduate student. We hope, considering Subject's background, that he will prove with WUSPARROW/1's guidance to be a profitable unwitting spotter and assessor of foreign graduate students.

Attention: Mr. Joseph G. Campbell

FROM:
Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: ISAACS. Harold Robert

1. Reference is made to your request dated 14 September 1965. The files of this office contain considerable information concerning Subject., the salient elements of which are summarized below.

2. According to undated information from a reliable source, Subject born 13 September 1910 in New York City, arrived in Shanghai, Chian, from Manila, Philippine Islands, in December 1930. First employed in Shanghai by the English language daily, *Evening Post and Mercury*. Subject became associated a few weeks later with the *China Press*, with which he remained until May 1931. In June 1931 Subject traveled up the Yangtze River with the British Communist, Cecil Frank GLASS, a suspected agent for the Third Laternational in China. Also in 1931, Subject became the Shanghai secretary of the Comite Liter-nationale Pour la Defense de Paul et Gertrude RUEGG (NOULENS), a committee, with Headquarters in Berlin, formed to aid the defense of the NOULENS against charges of espionage perferred by the Chinese Government. Subject was in correspondence with Will1 MUENZENBERG, President of the Committee and an active agent in Germany for the Third International. Subject was also known to be in contact with Agnes SMEDLEY in Shanghai during the same period. On 14 September 1932 in Shanghai, Subject married Viola ROBINSON, an American citizen born 10 June 1910 in New York City. Miss ROBINSON was believed to have been connected with Communist activities in the United States and in China. Correspondence between her and Subject prior to their marriage indicated that they were both sympathetic to activities being conducted by the Communists in China.

DISPATCH NO. NPK-A-4284

SECRET

TO: Chief, NEA DATE 5. May 1956

FROM: Chief of Station, Karachi

SUBJECT: Operational/INTEL Far Eastern Association 8th Annual Mooting, Request for Background and Operational Information

1.  The program of the 8th Annual Meeting of the Far Eastern Association, held in Philadelphia 3-5 April 1956, has just arrived here. It indicates that the association has already taken decided steps towards its announced expansion into the South Asian field. The station assumes that Headquarters covered the meeting and can get access now or later to copies of monographs, notes on proceedings, and so on.

2.  The following items, keyed to the program, would seem to be of interest to this station if Headquarters can get them:

A. On 3 April, Zakye Eglar: "The World View of the Punjabi Villager". (Note: This is quite likely the East Punjabi, but it should have some validity for Lahore as well as for Delhi.)

B. On the same day, a Pakistan Studies Organization Meeting was held at 1700. It would be useful to know who is interested in Pakistan studies (both individuals and organizations) and what lines they are thinking of working on.

C. On 5 April, all the items of a "South Asian Miscellany" should be of considerable interest, particularly Stanley Haron's "The Future of East Bengal". Hydecker has some early drafts of the Harold Isaacs study, but they are too early to provide any useful material; this project (at CENIS, MIT) is one that Headquarters should monitor closely, however.

TO:
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. S. J. Fapich.

FROM: Deputy Director, Plans

SUBJECT: Fernando SUGURRIA, also known as Fernando Lapuz ACHES

1. Reference is made to a communication from this Agency dated 30 August 1955, captioned as above, our reference CS CI-2542.

2. Attached for your information is a copy of a letter written by subject and addressed to the post office box mentioned in the referenced memorandum. The letter was signed by subject as FULL, his feminine pseudonym. It should also be explained that English is not subject's native language; therefore, the grammar and spelling used by subject in his letters are to be expected.

3. This office interprets subject's letter as follows:

a. Aunt Josephine is Jose LANDANG, with whom subject has been in contact the past several months and who has been indoctri-nating subject with leftist ideology. LANDANG has not admitted to subject that he is a Communist, although in his conversations with subject he sticks very close to the current line of the Philippine Communist Party (PKP).

b. Harold ISAACS (FBI File No. 100-286243) is well known to the bureau.

c. Uncle MANUEL is probably the late Philippine President Manuel QUEZON, who sponsored Jose LAISANG's entry into the United States in 1937 when LAISANG studied at Columbia University. William CARTER, Jr. has not yet been identified by this office.

d. PALILIO, thru is probably Dr. Filadelfo PALILIO, former Associate Professor of Mechanics at the University of the Philippines. PALILIO received his B.S.M.E from the University of the Philippines and his M.S. and Ph.D. at the University of Michigan.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

# TOP SECRET

According to a usually reliable source of this Agency, PANLILIO was never able to completely readjust to Philippine life after having lived in the United States. He is known for his strong pro-American views and according to source probably his greatest desire is to reside permanently in the United States. Although it is known that PANLILIO was on friendly terms with JOSE LANSANG there is no record that he shared LANSANG's political views.

e. Fr. DELANEY is probably Father DELANEY, Jesuit Chaplain at the University of the Philippines.

f. Cyprus or Caprus University may possibly be Syracuse University.

g. LIDEZ is probably Ricardo LIDEZ, Philippine news-paperman who was allegedly associated with Harry BRIDGES in the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) in Honolulu. LIDEZ was born on 5 April 1915 in Manila; however, most of his life has been spent in Hawaii. He was naturalized a U.S. citizen in 1943 and returned to the Philippines in 1949, where he lost his U.S. citizenship in 1952. There is no information in the files of this office which indicates that LIDEZ has returned to Hawaii. For additional information concerning LIDEZ, reference is made to a memorandum to the Bureau, dated 23 November 1949, subject: "Ricardo LIDEZ (aka Ricardo LAVEZ)", our reference SO DS-20307.

h. Uncle NEA is Romy CUYUGAN, Uncle BERTING is Baltazar CUYUGAN with whom the Bureau is familiar as a result of previous correspondence concerning his daughter, Carmen Jane CUYUGAN (FBI File No. 105-52561). From the wording of subject's letter this office assumes that Baltazar CUYUGAN is aware that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating for CUYUGAN. It also appears that Baltazar CUYUGAN gave subject a letter to deliver personally to his brother for CUYUGAN, possibly to avoid a mail intercept by the Bureau. It should be noted that subject stated that he mailed the letter instead.

4. In view of the sensitiveness of the source of the above information, it is requested that no further dissemination be made of the information without prior clearance with this Agency.

[Figure: signature]

ENCLOSURE (A) as listed above.

[Figure: stamp indicating '1 COPY' and 'CONFIDENTIAL']

1.  A happy ending has been written in the case of Ferris Appelman, former Communist who is now secretary of the General Rose Memorial Hospital of Denver. He has been praised in Washington for "disclosing his Communist past", and his board of directors has voted confidence in him and continued him in his job.

2.  No doubt all this is fitting and proper but it doesn't answer the question of why nobody in Denver seems to have known anything about Appelman's Red-tinged past, or why there was anything sensational about his revelation of it in Washington. While the police state is rightly anathema to American citizens, it seems remarkable that official records should not be in existence and reasonably accessable to people with reason to check up on such a point as past Communist service.

3.  The point about Appelman is not that he did anything particularly reprehensible, but that what he did was quite in the open. According to the Washington testimony he served the Communist party, apparently without special concealment, in Russia, Germany and other points in Europe, going around the world between 1924 and 1938. He sought to relieve Fox and Grace Granich in the editorship of a Shanghai English-language Communist magazine, "The Voice of China", in 1937, he testified, but didn't get off his ship in Shanghai because of the hostilities there at the time.

4.  This sheds something of a light on the supposedly fearless and ruthless Communist operations throughout the world. I was in Shanghai when fighting broke out there between Japan and China on Aug. 13, 1937, and can testify that we had three months of dingdong warfare before the campaign moved inland. During that period a good many people left for obvious reasons, but some came in, and it might be presumed that an accredited agent of international Comintern would at least have paused in nearby Kobe or Hongkong till things calmed down a little. Possibly the Communists are as subject to qualms about personal safety as anyone else--or more so.

5.  About "The Voice of China" there could hardly be any illusion in the mind of anyone who had cared to pay the slightest attention to it. Each issue bore a virtual advertisement of its Communist allegiance on its front cover, to those familiar with methods of converting Chinese into English. The name "Voice of China" appeared in both English and Chinese, and in the Chinese a peculiar Soviet-originated system of Romanization was used so that what is ordinarily, by conventional Wade system, written "Chung Hua" for China was spelled "Chung Hua"-- an extraordinary effect frankly explaining the publication's ownership.

6.  But what was more, Harold Isaacs, the editor who preceded the Granichs, had done considerably more than was conveyed by press dispatches from the Washington hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee. These said he was "believed to have deviated from Communist policy" whereas in fact he challenged with the Chinese Communists and their Moscow patrons


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

## CONFIDENTIAL

completely with an article headed "I Break with Stalinism." This gave a candid elucidation of the Communist financial backing of the "Voice of China" and if anyone either in or out of official life had previously suffered any illusions as to its nature, Issacs' article-published elsewhere than in the "Voice", of course-certainly should have dispelled them.

7. The Granichs seem to have lived quietly in Shanghai and were little known, which under the circumstances was hardly surprising since they were running an obviously Communist organ. Chiang Kai-shek's forces could not meddle with them openly, for at that time Shanghai was an international city operated under extraterritoriality. That the Nationalist secret police did create some trouble for the "Voice" and then Consul-General Clarence E. Gauss was allegedly reprimanded by the State Department in 1937 for not doing more to help them as Americans. Technically they were entitled to full American protection but Gauss, now with the import-export bank in Washington, D. C., was a sort of Old Curmudgeon of the Shanghai American community and it seems that he thought it his moral obligation to let them fry in any trouble they might get into as Communist agents. Gauss can't have suffered greatly for this in the eyes of his superiors, for he was later promoted to ambassador both to China and to Australia.

8. This background has some present importance since an American magazine is being operated today in Communist Shanghai, which tolerates no criticism or opposition. Originally pro-Nationalist under the late J. B. Powell, it has been friendly toward the Communists under his son, John William Powell, and it stayed on after most other American enterprises-including the daily Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, edited by myself-had shut down and American officials had left Red China.

9. Before they departed, these officials had reason to compile an extensive file on what is now the China Monthly Review. One incident which is known to have irked them was the Review's treatment of the case of William Olive, American consular official, in the summer of 1949 soon after the Communists had taken over. Clive blustered into a traffic conflict with the Communist police, was taken to first one and then a second police station, and in the course of several days' imprisonment he was severely beaten with fists and gunbutts, kicked and otherwise maltreated. Powell's Review blandly professed to have little information on the matter but gave an account unfavorable to Clive. Then consular officials asked Powell to come to the consulate and look Olive over and get the full story, he failed to show up. This and other matters were recorded in some detail but in view of the background of American intelligence operation, one may question whether those details will ever be hauled out of the files.

10. More recently, copies of the Review have been slanted strongly against the Americans and the United Nations cause in Korea and one issue editorially spoke of the United States as "the enemy." It should not be difficult to preserve continuity in following such a case of American pro-Communist activity abroad, though nothing could be done to Powell unless

or until he decided to return to his own country and evan thor, tha
comlex nature of American Imma on tide eneral subject make it hard to
tril what could be done aside from perhaje denyin; another passport to go
alroad again.

11. The important thing, as shown by a long list of casos pravoly
    Investigated by congruasional committees, is to have the postwar Central
    Intelligence Arency or some coparable group such as the Foleral Dureau of
    Investigation keep track of the wealth of information available. Too much

However, he is reported to have finally become convinced that the tactics of the Chinese Communists were wrong and that Trotsky was right in criticising them, and the Soviet Government under Stalin. He therefore wrote an article entitled," I Break with Stalin to Stalinists," in which among other things; he is reported to have stated that the expense of publishing the magazine had been financed by the Chinese Communists. He is then reported to have discontinued the magazine and to have sold the printing equipment, the sum being realised from the sale not being turned back to the Chinese Communists but to have been given to the Trotsky cause.

time was Friendship Heights, Newport Ave., 4938.

Newsweek. During this period, he had a great deal of trouble about censorship, and
reportedly was denied permission to visit Communist areas. It has been stated that
actually he was merely unfortunate in that he applied just after the government had
restored its ban on journalistic travel in that direction. At the time he had was
denied permission, Teddy WHITE of Time had just been allowed to go, and ISAACS felt
that he was being discriminated against. It has been stated that WHITE, upon his return
gave such a good account of administration in the Red areas that this, added to other
similar experiences, solidified the government's determination no to let any more
American newspapers go up and become Communist converts. In March 1945; ISAACS
was reported as about to leave Chungking permanently.

1. Reference is made to a memorandum from your office dated 3 July 1951 in which you requested that a Special Inquiry be conducted to resolve information concerning an allegation that Subject is sympathetic to and/or connected with Communist activities.

2. On 31 August 1951, Mr. Kenneth Patrum of the Security Office was advised that partial results have been received as a result of inquiries at several national agencies. The partial information reflected that Subject had been connected with at least two factions of the Communist Party while living in the Far East. It was suggested that extreme caution be used in contacting or associating with the Subject.

3. This office has completed the investigation of the Subject, which includes a check of records of the appropriate Federal agencies. As a result of this investigation, the files of this office contain a great deal of information concerning Subject's association with questionable organizations and individuals. Although Subject has denied any current activities with the Communist Party, his associations and activities are highly questionable and his political sympathy has not been unqualifiedly resolved at the present time.

4. In view of the information as set forth above, it is recommended that extreme caution be exercised in dealing with the Subject. Under no circumstances should Subject be contacted, with regard to possible use by this agency prior to receiving a final security determination by this office.

1. According to Hoang Hui, who works in the Viet Minh Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Leo Figueres was in Saigon in early 1950. The French did not allow him to remain in Saigon and he was forced to return to France. Figueres later went to Hong Kong in late August 1950, and then proceeded to the Viet Bac via the Hoa Nam (F.C. South China ?) road to attend the Third Congress of the FCI held in early October 1950.

2. There had been several previous cases of individuals who were unable to reach Viet Minh territory from Saigon because of French interference. In July 1949 Mr. A. Roth, Editor of the Sunday Tribune, arrived in Saigon and obtained all necessary papers; the French did not allow him to proceed because of his pro-Communist articles. Others were Walter Briggs of the Christian Science Monitor, Harold Isaacs from *Newsweek*, and S. J. Perelman (because he criticized Bao Dai in *Westward, Ho*!).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE

Attention: Mr. Foss H. Ingersoll

Subject: Harold Robert Isaacs

MICROFILMED
FEB 3 1966
DOC. MICRO. BER.

1. This is in reply to Mr. Jack B. Scotts request for information concerning Harold Robert ISAACS, made by telephone on 23 November 1949.

2. According to information obtained from a source considered reliable, Harold Robert ISAACS was born in New York City on 13 September 1910. He arrived in Shanghai from Manila in December 1930 and was in possession of American passport 177626. ISAACS was first employed in Shanghai by the *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury*, an English language daily published in Shanghai. After a few weeks, he became associated with the *China Press*, another English-language daily published in Shanghai, and was with this paper until May 1931. In June of the same year ISAACS made a trip up the Yangtze River with Cecil Frank Glass, a British subject and member of the British Communist Party, suspected of being an agent for the Third International in China.

3. On 15 June 1931, Claire Noulens, with aliases, was arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Police on charges of espionage in behalf of the Third International. ISAACS became the nominal secretary of the Comite Internationale Pour la Defense de Paul et Gertrude Ruegg (R.N.C.), a committee formed to aid the Noulens in their defense against charges of espionage preferred by the Chinese government. Our files reflect that ISAACS was in correspondence with Illi Huizenberg, the president of the Committee with headquarters in Berlin. Huizenberg was an active agent in Germany for the Third International. ISAACS is also known to have been in contact with Agnes Smedley in Shanghai at this time.

4. On 29 August 1932, ISAACS gave notice to the American Consulate General in Shanghai of his intended marriage to (Miss) Viola Morrin, an American citizen born 10 June 1910 in New York City. Isaacs arrived in Shanghai on 26 August 1932 from Vancouver, Canada, aboard the S.S. *Empress of Asia*, and was in possession of American passport 392046 issued in New York on 14 May 1931. The wedding was held on 14 September 1932 at the American Consulate General.

have been connected with Communist activities in the United States and
correspondence between I.A.M. and also Noulens prior to their
marriage, indicates that they were both sympathetic to activities being
conducted by the Communists in China. On 21 November 1932, Isaacs Noulens
was entrusted by Dr. Oscar Lanuza with the high defense attorney,
with teaching the English language to Mary Noulens, the four-year old
son of Hilaire and Gertrude Noulens.

5. On 4 April 1936, *IZA*, under the pseudonym of LO SÊM, published an
   article in the *foe Militant*, organ of the ociniist orkers' arty in
   New York, entitled *"Stalintern Ready to embrace Chiang Kai-shek --
   Offer day in return for Resurrection of the disastrous 1927 Epoque."*
   It is believed that I.A.M. later joined the fourth international, organized
   by Trotsky subsequent to the latter's calls from Russia.

6. During World War II ISAACS was a war correspondent for Newspaper
   in China. In July 1949 he was refused entry into China by Chinese
   Nationalist authorities, presumably as a result of anti-nationalist
   articles written by ISAACS for *Newsweek*.

7. Harold Robert ISAACS is currently Special Features Editor for *Newsweek*,
   152 West 42nd Street, New York, New York. He is the author of several
   books, including *No Peace In Asia* and *The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution*.
   Isaacs' current political beliefs are unknown to this agency.

8. Should Isaacs leave this country, this agency should appreciate being
   advised of his intended destination, date of departure and any other
   pertinent details.

SUBJECT: INTERVIEW BETWEEN MR. HAROLD ISAACS,
MR. CHARLES TATSU, AND ER. DIA!.

SOURCES: Mr. Harold Isaaca, correspondent for Newswook magazine.
Mr. Charles Tácbú, Kalaya born Tamil, formerly employed
on Singapore newspapers, nowscastor for Singapore
radio, English-speaking amouncer on Satavic Radio
during occupation, and presently editor of newspaper

Mr. Dia, ealtor of Merdeka, nationalist newspaper, Batavia.

EVALUATION: B-3, except as noted.

The subject interview was held at the request of Fr. Isaacs
in line with his desire to talk with leading figures of Indonesian
nationalist movement who held no official government position.

CIRCULATION OF MERDEKA

Asked about present circulation of MERDEKA, Mr. Diah replied
with the following; MERDEKA is the largest Indonesian newspaper on
the island of Java. At present it is printed only in Batavia, with
a dally total circulation of about 13,000 copies. Of this number,
approximately 6.000 copies aro sent cut of the city by train to
Bandoeng, Soorakarta, and Djoklakarta, leaving a Batavia circulation
of between 10,000 and 14,000 copies. Source exprossed the opinion
that while the Indonesian population of Batavia is in the neighborhood
of 500,000 persons, the literacy rate is portars cnly twenty percent
of this figure. Thus, he admitted, MERDEKA 18 probably reaching less
than four percent of the total Indonesian population of Batavia,
despite the fact that Batavia is probably the most literate area on
the island of Java because of corcentration here of all the govern-
Fontal functions, prevar and present..

When questioned as to why his circulation was so inconsistent
with the potential reasing population, source replied that he was
Handicapped by lack of pasor. He expressed the opinion that a
circulation of 50,000 would be assured, and a circulation of as high
as 100,000 possible, were sufficient paper avallatie. At the present
rate of onsumption, to estimates that sufficient paper is en tand

# THE INDEPENDENT

On December 7, 1945, the MERDEKA press commenced publication of a daily English language newspaper entitled INDEPENDENT. The masthead of this paper states also that it incorporates the INDONESIAN NEWS BULLETIN, a former English language newspaper published by ANTARA News agency.

The INDEPENDENT is at present being edited by Mr. Tarbu, with some assistance from Mr. Diah, and using the paper and facilities of MERDEKA.

The first issue of INDEPENDENT was remarkable only for its avoidance of any discussion of local affairs, only two articles having anything whatever to do with Java. Questioned about this, Tambu admitted that, while his ultimate ambition was to reach foreign and troop (British) readers, he was hesitant about entering headlong into discussion of local affairs and the Nationalist cause, because, (0-3), the British are unfavorably disposed towards MERDEKA already, and would use his venture as an excuse to confiscate the entire printing plant, were he too openly partisan in his early issues. Within a week or two he hopes to be secure enough in his position to start laying more stress on local news and editorials.

The first issue of INDEPENDENT was printed in 400 copies, most of which were given away, although the stated price is 1 Japanese guilder the copy.

27 March 1945

To: Lieutenant Colonel ROCER A. PFAFF

From: John I. Coddington

Subject: HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS

Mr. GEORGE N. KATES of 033, P&A, has just returned to the United States from Chungking. He reached Washington yesterday. He claims to have known HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS quite well in Chungking, and has the following observations to make concerning Mr. ISAACS:

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS is about 35 years of age. He attended Columbia University, and received the degree of A.B. there in 1930. He is the son of an orthodox Jewish merchant, who is very wealthy, and who has always supported HAROLD, even though he did not approve of the radical views that HAROLD expressed in the 1930's.

HAROLD went to China immediately after graduation from Columbia, partly, atleast, out of a desire to see strange parts of the world and to experience "adventure." He went out by way of Hawaii, and stowed away for part of the voyage - either between San Francisco and Honolulu, or between Honolulu and Shanghai - Mr. KATES does not remember which. Anyway, this was part of the "adventure."

In China, HAROLD met a South African named FRANK GLASS, who was an "intellectual" and a very interesting person. CLA33 was a Leftist, but not at all a Communist. HAROLD took a trip up the Yangtse with GLASS in 1930 or 1931. At about this time, HAROLD became a convert to Trotskyism, partly, at least, under GLASS's influence. He felt that "suffering humanity" required a "revolution" to set things straight. Communism was too organized, and HAROLD was a complete individualist, and reacted strongly against the organizational set-up of Communism, and so espoused Trotskyism. He returned to Shanghai from the western part of China, and went to work for

THE HAVAS News Agency. Shortly after this, in Shanghai, he married VIOLA ROBINSON, who was, like HAROLD, a wide-eyed intellectual. This marriage probably took place in 1932. VIOLA was a great friend of AGNES SMEDLEY, the author of the *Battle Hymn of China* and of other books dealing with the Chinese Revolution.

An organization called the China League for Civil Rights was formed about 1932. YANG CHI'EN was the head of this for Central China, and Dr. HU SHIH (later Chinese Ambassador to Washington) was the head of it for North China. YANG was at that time Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica. YANG was soon assassinated by the Blue Shirts (at that time CHIANG KAI-SHEK's bodyguard). HAROLD ISAACS had been an enthusiastic member of the China League for Civil Rights, and in the atmosphere of turmoil, after the killing of YANG, when all leftists were under attack by the Kuomintang, HAROLD became the editor and publisher of the *China Forum*, a magazine that published a number of controversial articles. The magazine was protected by the fact that the editor was an American, and therefore had extra-territorial rights. Yet the magazine was regarded as a "thorn in the flesh" by Mr. CUNNINGHAM, who was at that time American Consul-General in Shanghai. There were various controversies -- the printing shop was broken up by Kuomintang strong-arm men; the mails were refused to the magazine; but he continued publication for some time, and smuggled the copies out to the subscribers.

In 1933 or 1934, ISAACS had a fight with AGNES SMEDLEY. It was an ideological fight, and therefore especially bitter. ISAACS and his wife left Shanghai after this, and moved to Peking. There he acquired a Chinese translator named LIU, and there he settled down to write his book, *The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution*.

This book "nails the Stalinists to the mast" and shows that they were messing around with a situation in China which they did not understand. Very many people who have read the book consider it excellent.

The book was completed, and ISAACS and his wife returned to the United States about April or May 1935. Immediately after this, ISAACS made a rapid trip to Oslo, Norway, to see his hero, LEON TROTSKY, who was living there at that time. It was on this occasion that he must have undertaken to translate TROTSKY's book, *Whither France* ? ISAACS then returned to New York, and went to work for the HAVAS News Agency once more.

At some time in the late 1930's, he became interested in New York politics, and he worked hard for NORMAN THOMAS.

By 1940, however, ho became disgusted with New York politics, and became interested in the war, and in bourgeois life." He and his wife had a baby at about this time (their first), and ISAACS found he could write radio scripts and get good money for them. Up to 1940, he had been living chiefly off his father, but from 1940 on, he began to make money. In 1942, he did a "Report to the Nation" for CBS.

Soon after this, he joined the Staff of *News-Week*, and in 1944 was sent to Chungking by that magazine. There must have been a certain amount of trouble in convincing the Chinese Central Government that ISAACS had really changed since the old days in Shanghai; but this convication was evidently accomplished, or ISAACS would not have received permission from the Chinese Covernment to go to China.

ISAACS is a very smart ran indeed. He knows a lot about China, and he knows a lot about people in general. Moreover, he is a great deal "smoother" and more diplomatic now than he was ten years ago.

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS is now the correspondent of *Newsweek* magazine in China. His headquarters are in Chungking, but he evidently travels to Kunming, Kweiyang, and other places in the course of his duties. He seems to have arrived in China in his present capacity during the summer of 1944, probably in July.

Subject was born in 1910, and is a member of a wealthy family. He became a firmly convinced Trotskyist in his youth, and remained one till the time of Pearl Harbor. He is now regarded as a renegade by his former Trotskyist colleagues, because he has disavowed the principles of world revolution, turned away from Trotsky's teachings, and since 1939 has been writing patriotic propaganda for the United States Government.

He went to China about 1930, and wrote two books dealing with Chinese politics, *Five Years of Kuomintang Reaction* (1932), and *The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution* (1938). Both of these volumes expressed the author's Trotskyist point of view. The first was published in Shanghai, and the second in London. Neither was ever published in the United States, and ISAACS said that the Stalinist Communists were so powerful in this country that they were able to prevent the publication of *The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution* here. This book received high praise from many serious students of Far Eastern affairs, including G.F. Hudson, Fellow of All Souls College at Oxford, and author of *The Far East in World Politics*, who said that ISAACS' book was the test one ever written on the Chinese Revolution. Hudson is now an official of the British Ministry of Information.

ISAACS' non-Communist and non-Trotskyist friends say that even during the

height of his Trotskyist career, ISAACS never accepted money from the group. He was always open and above-board, and never engaged in any conspiracies to overthrow established government. He was attracted to the movement, they say, by sheer idealism.

For a time in China, ISAACS lived with Tillman DURDIN, the China correspondent of the *New York Times*, who was then the managing editor of the *China Press*. ISAACS returned to the United States in the late 1930's, and was for a time employed by the havas News Agency, until the fall of France in 1940. In 1943, he was employed by *Newsweek* magazine in Washington, D.C., and resided at 4938 Newport Avenue, Freindship Heights.

From a cusory perusual of these editions, the "Nation's political policy appears to be a socialistic nature, openly professing opposition to the Republican and Democratic doctrines prevailing throughout the United Shun States, and advocating support for the Socialist Party's own candidate-Norman Thomas at the forth coming Presidetial elections.

Further articles appearing in these editions are nothing more nor less that sourrilous attacks on the Republican President of The USA.-Herbert Hoover.

# I Break with the Chinese Stalinists

To the Central Committee of the Chineue Communist Party:
The two-year period of my extra-organizational collaboration with the Chinese Communist party has come to an end and the China Forum mitch I founded and edited during that time has been forced to suspend publication. In the interest of our whole movement as well as in my personal interest, I consider it necessary to record here and publish the history of the China Forus and the circumstances of its suspension......

XXXXX

Fror almost the vory baginning of my active work - which I date from the time I began reporting events in China in a communist way - a number of questions presented themselves to me in increasingly forcible fom. These arose originally from my discovery of the gross distortions and exaggeratione which I found to be characteristic ef communia propaganda in China and abroad. I define propaganda as the skillful, clear, accurate and wholly truthful reporting of the facts linked to an incisive, purposive interpretation and a plan of action for dealing with the facts in a revolutionary way. I leamed this from the life and work of Lenin and his Bolshevik comrades who taught us that the truth comes from the masses themselves and that only disaster can result from telling them lies. I have never learned to the contrary that it was my revolutionary duty to work in any other way, although I soon found that the present-day Communist party press, makes a practise of distinguishing between propugand puganda and truth.

Examples of exaggeration and distortion most striking to me were naturally those which applied to China, because here I could check allegations with known facts. I first wrote these down to the ignorance or incapacity of individuals. I felt that communist editors ained would putlich accurate facts about Crine if they could set then. Accordingly with a friend I tried to set up an independent mail news service and sent weekly bulletins to papera all over the world giving brief, charp, factual accounts of what was going on. This was in the fall of 1931 after my return from the area of the great Central China floods of that summer. I scarcely understood then why this service failed to secure any response from the communist prese abroad. After about three mon the I had to suspend it for lack of support. It simply aidn't get püblished except in a few organs which were not official Communist party papers, including the New York Militant.

It wasn't long before I began to perceive, wit with a deeper etudy of international events and the history of the Chinese vovolution, that a consistent thread ran through the distortions and exaggeratione which I found not only in brief casual reports of current events tut in the solem pronunciamentoes made by delegates before plenums of the B.C.C.I. I discovered that these departures from the truth were made necessary by the official premise that over since the catastrophe of 1927 a mighty, upeur-ging revolutionary covement has been marching forward in China to the very brink of aaizure of power under the leadership of the Chinese Communist party. I discovered that these exaggeraticro were necенвагу сесливе Wie precise was false and along with it all the basic tonets of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

2

politics being pursued by the Communist Intomational and the Communist party in China. I cannot bagin here to give a summary of outs of these distortione (which I verbally cated to you by the dozen), ranging from particular incidents (the wilfully false picture givon of the cutton mill strike in Shanghai in January 1932, dren to the point of trans.osing it to February to heighten the impression given of the workers' role in the Thanghai war) to high-flown generalizations like the statement recently made before the plenum of the B.C.C.I. that the C.C.P. has "won over the majority of the Chinese working class and the pousantry"..... In denying the presence of a might revolutionary upsurge (1.6., a vast organized march toward the sel- zure of power), I respect facte made still cloarer perhaps when compared to the facts and figures of the monster mass movements of the 1925-27 period. The tragic errore of the communist leaderonip in 1927. were primarily responsible for the decapitation of that great movement and because no lessons have been drawn from these events to this very day, these errors, monstrously accumulated, are still responsivio for the tragedies of today. But for the purpusus of our com- parison herë, let us take for example the single fact that in 1926 in Greater Shanghai, there were 257 atrikee. In 1932 there were 82. Let us remember that on the eve of the workers' sóizure of power in Shanghai in March, 1927, there were more than 800,000 workers, handicrafts- men and petty traders out on the streeta fighting with arms in hande for demando of a far-reaching political character. A close check for the entire country in the latter half of 1933 showed me that less than one- thirtieth of that number wore engaged in strikes and other disputes during any given month and that almost invariably the demands were defensive demands against waga oute and lockouts. Moreover, the lack of cohe. Bivo leadership often in departments of the same factory or in one or more of a group of factories- or even sometimes lack of even the most element lementary organization has in almost every case led to deadening failure and relatively easy betrayal by the yellow "labor leaders" and mediators" of the Kuo Min Tang. In 1925 thẻ shooting of thirteen students by British police in Shanghai vào the touch-off for a general strike which paralyzed the city and mich was seconded by vast sympathy strikes which broke like a series of tidal waves over the entire o country. In January 1932, when the Japanese: imperialists used the Shanghai International Settlement as a base for operatione which cost the lives of tone of thousands of Chinese, not a single strike interrupted the normal course of the public or other services in that settlement.. In the factories there were no strikes but a large scale lockout to which the overwhelming majority of Shanghai's workera subaitted without protest.... In the asse of the widespread but isolated and individual cases of peasant uprisings, and this includes the Red armies in Kiangai, these struggles await the leadership of a strong working clase movement before they can have a success issue. The Red armies in their restricted and surrounded areas and with their mougre resources have fought heroically against the Kuomintang attacks upon them. But until the Kuo Min Tang is shaken from its bulwarko in the imperialist- controlled working class centers, their prospect of revolutionary triumph remaine necessarily dim. No revolutionary purpose is served by taking refuge in the fiction that these araten have proletarian loudership because individual workers, undoubtedly


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

-3-

loaders of superior quality and courage, have been torn from their factories and from war fellow workers and sent coun te occupy koy positions in the Red Army a18-tricte and in the Red armies themselves. Indeed, thie common practise of extracting the most conscious and pro-gressive working class elements from their vorking class environment and sending them down to the Hed districts is a good irdex to the criminal transposition of emphasis which has helped paralyze the working class movement in the cities. If the White Terror doesn't carry off the workers' lenders as they arise, the C.P. Goee and hae done so in hundreds of cases. This helps in no mall part to explain why it has also been impossible to mobi-lize a genuire mass anti-Japanese movement in the face of military aggression and why the White Terror of the Kuo Hin Tang has succeeded, by filling mass gravce and in-numerable prisons with the martyred dead and living, in downing the anti-imperialist movement or efforts toward the organization of such a movement and paving the way for the ever-increasing encroachments of the imperialista. The party has not yet gripped and directed the bitter and often inarticulate hatred of the masses of the people for their oppressore and this includes large sections of the lower party bourgeoisie who could be won by Buссеssful mase pressure from below. This is because they party has failed to translatethe realities of every-day events into its program and tactics.....

XXXXX

But precicely because ut all costs I desired to carry on the Forum's open struggle against the common onemy - against the Kuo Min Tang and the imperialiste I seduloualy avoided bringing these issure into the columns of the paper, increasingly against my better Judgment. "I leaned over far backward in this respect. Tris expressed itself in many of the current issues with which we had to deal.

I ask you to recall the whole uphill fight which the Forum waged on behalf of Paul and Gerturd Ruegg in the epring and summer of 1932 during which time I repeatedly warned against the emphasis which was being placed on the "legal" aspects of the case and the "negotiations" with the Kuo Min Tang to the detriment of mase pressure and the capitalization of the case for political purposes. You paid lip service to the need for mass prceaure - particularly here in China but in fact the "legalities" and futile negotiations remaired the major pillars of the defense. Until in the very end I finally rebelled, I wasn't even permitted to give Ruegg his honorable and rightful title secretary of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat! Yet although I felt the struggle for the Rueggs was being seriusly handicapped by the tactica being pursued, I carried on the fight with ail the energy at my command and you will recall that it was I who created the local defense committee and was chiefly responsible for the widespread press propaganda campaign and the considerable sympathy which we aroused. Yet the strictly non-political attitude which Ruegg was forced to assиде at the trial (in contrast to the highly political attitude of his prosecutore!) was in my opinion one of the major reasons for the fate to which he and his wife were condemned,

I ask you to recall the whole period of the organi-zation and activities of the China League for Civil Rights, from Decamber 1932 to June 1933, in which I tock an active. part. I gave full play to this hybrid League ard its sork without once publishing the basic criticisms wrich I often voiced to you and which in the end were wholly confirmed by what happened after the Kuo Min Tang murdered Yang Chien in June that year. I ask you to recall the views 1 set forth in August and September 1923, on the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 134

subject of the "Anti-ar Congress" which at your
specific request I did not publish. Instead, to my
regret. I published the feul rot of Marley & Co.
without freely giving play to the true facts about
that farcical. Junket which had convinced me that the
policies which gave it birth do not one single whit
advance the international struggle against imperialist
war.

On one occasion - and this at least I can take
comfort in I passively resisted when you requested
me to write and publish a slanderous attack on Chen
Du Halu when he was condemned to 13 years imprisonment
by the Kuo Min Tang. Your request was specific. I
was not to deal with the issues which had brought
Chen Du Hoiu from being the leader of the C.P. in 1927
to being leader of the Chinese Opposition in 1933. I
was only to string together a vile series of labels
in an effort to explain why the Kuo Hin Tang even
imprisoned the leader of the left Opposition. As
you know, that attack was never written or published.

Again in December 1933, upon my return from
Fukien, you specifically demanded that I set aside
the results of my own personal investigations. in
Foochow in order to write on your behalf (but over
my signature!) an utterly baselessand slanderous
attack on the Left Opposition. You will recall that
you charged at that time that the "Trotskyiste" were
prominently identified with the new govemnont set
up in Fukien by Chen Ming-shu and Teai Ting-kai. You
lumped the Left Opposition with the Third Party and
the socalled Social Democrats among the petty bourgecis
satellites of the Fukien militarists. It was as much
to satisfy myself on this very point as to perform a
mission for you, that I went down to Foochow and
spent two weeks there and learned through direct.con-
tact with dozens of people prominently concemed that
the Left Opposition was stoutly and clearly opposed
to the Foochow regime. I haven't place here to dis-
cuss the relations of the C.P, to the short-lived
Fukien government or the character of the "negotia-
tions" which were going on down there. The importunt,
thing here is that on my return you demanded that I
write slanders which flew in the face of everything
I myself had learned. It is interesting, as a side-
light on your methods in factional strife as you
conceive it, that your representative in Foochow sent
back a report, through me, ironically enough, that
one of the most prominent of the youthful pseudo-
radicals in Poochow, du Cui-yuen to be exact, was a
leading. "Trotskyist". It so happened that I had met.
and had several long thy interviews with fu and by
the time I left Foochow I understood his pealtion and
his personality exceedingly well. He was as much a
Trotskyist as Mei Lan-rang is! Yet you actually
demanded that I ignore my own knowledge of the man
and in my article on Fukien set him down as a
"Trotskyist". I was faced on the one hand by your
demande that I write falsehoods to suit your policies
and on the other by my deep desire to set forth the
actual facts about the Opposition's attitude toward
the Fukien regime. But once more, to preserve the
shrede of our relationship. I drove a middle course
and did neither, leaving the whole question out of
my article.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

Nevertheless, abruptly in January of this year you forced an ultimatum upon me and subsequently forced the break in our relationship because I could not and would not, at your demand, devote the China Forum to policies which I could not and do not believe compatible with the interests of the Chinese revolution and the international proletarian revolution. I could not, at your demand, set aside the convictions to which I had literally been driven by the stinging lash of catastrophic events in China, Germany and the world over. Particularly my deep interest in Chinese events during the last three years made it impossible for me, finally, to give active support to policies and tactics whose disastrous effects were being a thousandfold confirmed for me by the tragic events of every swiftly-passing day. I could not ignore questions which strike at the roots of our work and the whole structure of our hopes for a revolutionary future.

Despite the fact that these questions are rocking the entire International today, you denied my right to raise them in print. You demanded more. You demanded that I attack anybody who did so - primarily the people you call "counter-revolutionary Trotskyists" - the only people who are facing these problems today in a fearless revolutionary way! You demanded that the China Forum become a stereotype for the policies and vulgar factional slanders which I could neither then nor now be party to.

In reply to my questions on China you simply quoted back at me the lies and half-lies I've been so used to reading in Inprecorr. You even declared: "For propaganda purposes a certain amount of exaggeration is necessary...." and went, on amazingly to say: "but we know the ture facts and we base our policies on them, not on these exaggerations!" A new slant on modern-day C.I. tactics! Facts, you say are curious things. They have to be turned around and around and arcund, and examined closely until their true nature becomes apparent. The trouble is you turn them so far and so quickly that they turn into something like a dizzily turning top of fancy - or at best wish-fulfilling misrepresentations!

To my questione on Germany you quoted Heckert, Platritsky and the B.C.C.I.'s famous resolution declaring that the collapse of the German party and the slaughter of the German workers were based on the past, present and future correct policies of the C.P.C.! You declared I had no right to offer critical comment on the dangerously opportunistic foreign and domestic policies of the U.S.S.R. most notably on the entry of the U.S.S.R, on a straight nationalist basis into the disgusting corridors of imperialist intrigue. To the contrary, I was livingly, fawningly to foudle and hail the policies which have meant disaster in China, Germany and elsewhere and are rapidly loading the U.S.S.R. into the vacuum of nationalist isolation from the world-wide proletarian movement! This I was to do, to begin with, by publishing Stalin's face on the front page and columne of the customary penegyrice to his infallibility. Above all and before all, I was to take up cudgele against "counter-revolutionary Trotskyism". That was to be the main point of my reformation - to raise no questions myself and slander anybody else who did so.

In reply to your demand that I submit to an editorial board in order that these editorial policies should be effectively put into practise, I offered (1) to continue publication strictly as before, meanwhile arguing out my differences with you in discussions on the side: (2) to throw the columne of the Forum open to a general discussion


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 136

of all basic revolutionary actions, wit. free play to
unorthodox as well as orthodox viedo, If your viewe
were correct. I argued, it would be a distinct advan-
tage to you to have such an opportunity to display their
brilliance alongside the puny efforts of your critica;
(3) to publish orthodox news and views but to reserve
for myself the right to comment and criticise.

These repeated offers you repeatedly, refused. You
offered to discuss these questiono 1th me verbally if
in the meanwhile I threw the Porur rur open to your editorial
board. My other proposals were unthinkable! Give the
Forum'a rendere a chance to hear "counter-revolutionary
viewpointe? Never that I could only dioplay my
revolutionary parity by acceding to your demands. To
would talk things over until spring, when if all sent
well (i.e. if I showed a satisfactory adaptation to
your viewpoint). I could pack up for an educational trip
to the Soviet Union where I would certainly become con-
vined of the error of my ways. In other words, you wanted
my signature on a promissory note with the amount left
blank for you to fill in. You put this in the form of
an ultimatum and you told me that if I did anything but
accept I would forthwith enter the comp of the "counter-
revolution".

I had to refuse these terms. I had to refuse to
iend myself to a slandercus and baseless struggle against
the International Left Opposition. I had to refuse to
land space to the nauseatingly fawning praise of Stalin
and uncritical reception of Stalinist policies which
characterize the Communist party press the world over.
I had to refuse to take shelter in the cold and draughty
empty spaces which stretch benind the impressive facade
and early traditions of the Communist Intemational.
would like to go to the Soviet Union for a visit the day-
but I had to refuse your offer on your terme. I had to
refuse, in short, to become a hack prostitute in the name
of the revolution.

In the end, too, I had to refuse to turn over to
you the printing plant I had built up with so mạch pain
and struggle because I considered it not your property.
but the property of the working class covmant. Because
I could not carry on the Porun myself, for lack of
financial resources and caciuse of heavy debts contracted,
I disposed of the plant and tumed every farthing of the
proceeds over to where I now consider the twice interests
of our movement lie. It was with a deep and Abiding.
bitterness that I had to see the Forun go down under the
blows of those whom I had considered comrades, when for.
two yeare it had fought off all its many enemies on the
outside.

Yet with it came the realization that we have to
build anew over the ruins you have wrought. The revo
lution and the building of our future moves forsard ind
when we trample down, the defenses of our enemies we shall
crush underfoot everything and everybody that stunde in
our way. No sycophantis, blind allegiance to a name,
an empty facade, a tom and shredded preatige can lead
us forward. Only unswerving fidelity to our goal and
active struggle toward this end in th the weapons of a
correct and tested political line will lift as from
defeat to ultimate vistory. To this struggle I shall con-
tinue to dedicate all my energies.

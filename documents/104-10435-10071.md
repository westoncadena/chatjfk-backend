DIMITROV claimed he began underground anti-Fascist activities in 1943 in Macedonia and to have worked closely with Dr. George M. DIMITROV (who headed the left-wing of the Agrarian Party known as *Pladne*) during this time.

October 1946

DIMITROV arrested by the police. He believes the reason he was not executed was that the communists wanted to use him as a witness against Nikola PETKOV.

30 April 1950 (date of information)

The Bulgarians at Lavrion Camp established a new political organization known as the "P. D. Petkov Organization". The member, who are listed in the protocol (attached to the report), have deserted the Bulgarian Agrarian Party in an effort to retain their "pure" agrarian character. In the opinion of the Petkov Organization, the Agragrian Party has been penetrated by the leftists. Protocol signed on 30 April 1950.

DIMITROV's name appears as a member of the Board of Control.

OCTOBER 1950

Early in October 1950, DIMITROV visited the Lavrion Camp where he met with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been given a "charter and instructions", by certain members of the American Embassy, to form a committee of five members for the planning and execution of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according to DIMITROV, would be established in Athens and would cooperate with other similar committees which have already been formed in France, Germany, and other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc". Recruits would come from among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party (Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. Eligible Bulgarian emigres would come to Greece from Western Europe to assist in the work, and pro-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

minent members of the Gichev Agrarians and of the Democratic Party would be assisted in escaping to Greece (presumably from Bulgaria) to join the organization.

DIMITROV listed the organization's tasks as follows:

a. Intelligence activity in Bulgaria.
b. Organization of an underground resistance movement in Bulgaria, and
c. Organization of sabotage activity against Bulgaria.

DIMITROV revealed that he was the president of the organization.

DIMIRTOV took frequent occasion to mention that the committee had its headquarters in the American Embassy where he has a room assigned for his own use. He also stated that the commitee maintains offices at 13 Patission Street, 7th floor, rooms 2-4, and there are already working at this address sight Bulgarian-speaking Americans. He also stated that hos office has two Bulgarian typewriters and a car with US license plates.

1 November 1950.

DIMITROV again visited the Lavrion Camp to inform his recruitsthat they would shortly be moved to a pleasant hime in Athens which the Americans were repainting for the purpose. On the occasion of this visit, the recruits were divided into three groups, as follows:

a. a groupd of 10 men to specialize in intelligence;
b. a group of 6 men to be trained in radio in Germany
c. a group of 15 men to specialize in sabotage.

The source of hhe information contained in the SODB 31992 described DIMITROV as"an unprincipaled opportunist and Greek agent".

SODB 31992, 14.12.50


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

During this period of time, DIMITROV was the principal agent
in an ill-fated operation which resulted in a major expose and
trial in Sofia during 1951. The agents used were those selec-
ted by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was poto probably an
operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer
of his colleagues.

The 1949 files* of the French intelligence network "Ulysse" run by Captain Michel de la RONCIER, Military Attache of the French Embassy, Athens, listed Dimitrd DIMITROV as an agent (Ulysse 62). He is tuither described as being in contact with Tsenko and Ivan BAREV, two Bulgarians who may have still been working for with the British. In addition, DIMITROV was a contdet of the Greek Aliens Directorate. His file contained two repants, one dated 6 April 1949, containing "the military situation" and the other dated 6 April 1949, containing an account of "the Greek Government Council of Coordination".

*[Illegible content]*

*-These documents were obtained by a penetration of French witelligence files.

**Captain de la RONCIER, was the military Attache of the French Embassy in Athens, who conducted French operations out of Athens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

Principal agent in an ill-fated operation run from October 1950 to March 1951. The operation resulted in a major expose and trial in Sofia during 1951. The agents used were those selected by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was probably an operative of the Bulgarian militia and acted as the betrayal of his colleagues.

(2) Although the extent of DIMITROV's knowledge of operations was limited, it was considered extremely undesirable to allow these facts into French hands. Arrangements were therefore, made with Greek authorities for his arrest just before his scheduled meeting with the French representative to whom he was to deliver the information and from whom he was to receive the money.

(3) DIMITROV made six agents immediately available for infiltration operations. Three of these six were successfully infiltrated on 10 December, carrying leaflets signed in the name of the Bulgarian Democratic bloc, the emigre political group organized, and head by DIMITROV.

DIMITROV remained under Greek control until he left Greece by air to Frankfurt.

Chief of Station, Athens

Chief, NE

PIRANPART (Subject of Reference)

REF: NEAA-02613, 17 July 1869

1. Subject of reference may be remembered by some Athens Station officers under the name, Lyle O. KILLLY (P). KELLY was recruited in October 1950 as a P.A. for a political, psycho-logical, and guerrilla warfare project based in Greece and targeted against Bulgaria. He is the subject of a five volume 201 dossier at Headquarters which goes back to 1949.

2. EHLLY was born 7 May 1924 in Nedkovote, Bulgaria. He studied philolegy for one year at Sofia University from 1942-43. During the war to worked illegally in Greek Macedonia and Vardar, Macedonia to escape the German authorities. He returned home after the war; he was soon disillusioned by the Communists and vent to Sofia. Later be made a clandestine tour of Bulgarian towns urging agrarians to take positive action against communica. Finally captured in Sofia, he stated that his life vas apared bocause he was groomed as a vitness against PETEOV. He escaped to Greece in 1947 and subsequently worked for the Grocks doing occasional propaganda under a shortened version of his true first name.

3. KELLY was first contacted in October 1950 by the Field Chief of OFC activities in Athens, Greece. During the period October 1950 through March 1951, he was employed by OPC, Athens and provided 21 agents for infiltration into Bulgaria, but he

Distribution:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

# SECRET
NKAW-1067

never participated in the actual cross-border operations. In early 1951, various operational and administrative difficulties began to manifest themselves and it was decided that KELLY should be removed from his position. In April 1951 it came to OPC's attention that KELLY intended to sell his operational knowledge to the French Intelligence Service. This fact was used as the primary reason for his removal from active participation in Bulgarian operations.

4. Because of operational security considerations stemming from KELLY's duplicity and personal make-up, it was deemed inadvisable to leave him at large in Greece. It was decided to transfer him to a holding facility in the Western Hemisphere. He was airlifted from Athens to Frankfurt where he was hospitalized four days for observation, and then flown to the holding facility, arriving on 4 September 1961. He remained there until January 1954 when at that time it was determined whatever operational knowledge he had was obsolete.

5. After unsuccessful efforts to resettle KELLY in Brazil, he was temporarily removed from the holding area to Syros, Greece. A commitment was made to the Greek authorities that RVROCK would not abandon him in Greece and would take steps to have him resettled in one year. Efforts were made to effect KELLY's migration to Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere, but to no avail. After due consideration by the authorities concerned, it was decided that the best effective solution would be to let him immigrate to the United States on his own under the Refugee Relief Act program.

6. Since entering the United States, KELLY has been a continual source of embarrassment. Meglomania is evident in his various communications with U.S. government agencies. Over the years he has written lengthy letters to the Director, Secretary of State, USIA, Vice President Nixon, President Kennedy, etc. A typical example of this correspondence was his letter to the Vice President requesting an appointment as Mr. Nixon's anti-communist advisor, or the statement in his letter to President Kennedy that he could liberate the Balkan countries from Communism in five years if he were allowed to work actively with financial support. Our first knowledge that KELLY was representing himself as a film producer was a 14 May 1957 notice from the Department of State advising that KELLY was trying to interest them in purchasing a feature length film script.

7. The last correspondence from Athens on KELLY is contained in NKAA-990 of 26 April 1968, written by Philip L. BACHMAN (P). On this occasion KELLY appeared at the American Embassy in Athens asking to talk to the First Secretary. He identified himself as leader of "The Bulgarian Liberation Underground Movement Against Communism." The Station at this time reported no traces, but added a comment that he probably was identical with Subject of 201-045145. However, the Station evidently has no record of his pseudo or his early association with us.

8. A final note, concerning his marriage to the Greek woman mentioned in reference, may be of interest considering the events which generated the latest inquiry from the field. At one time during his sojourn in the holding area mentioned above, KELLY confided that his marriage was recognized by both parties as one of convenience. He claimed that he and his former wife agreed to marry in order to be eligible for immigration to the United States


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

SECRET
SKAF-1067

with a minimum waiting period. He gave a lengthy, complicated explanation of how this was supposed to work. However, their well laid plans were wrecked by the arrival of a baby daughter while they were in Rome, Italy on their first step toward immigration. According to KELLY, this event forced their return to Athens where he eventually got involved in Bulgarian operations. He declared that had their plans worked out, he and his former wife had agreed to part company once they were safely ensconced in the United States.

9. Ve feel this account should be on record at the Station because judging from the past performance the infamous Lyle O. KELLY (P) probably will come to our attention again. Ve can provide more detailed information on EELLY's operational history if required.

1.  Subject is Dimitrios #*DIMITROF aka General Dico DIMITROV;
    DPOB: 24 May 24 in Bulgaria; Citizenship: Unknown; Occupations:
    Movie film producer; Address: c/o Marjorie DARE, 360 West 22nd Street
    New York, New York; Miscellaneous: Claims to have worked for WOFIRM.

2.  Subject came to Station attention as a result of a pre- marital investigation which was being conducted by LNEASE on Kalliopi Stylianou GERALEXIS; aka "Poppy", Mrs. Dimitrios DIMITROF, born 18 August 1941 in Athens, Greece who was married to Subject in a civil ceremony in Italy on 4 July 1962. The marriage was not recognized by Greek law. Under separate cover is a copy of the LNEASE memo which outlines Subject's allegations regarding collaboration with WOFIRM.

3. The marital investigation turned up the following traces from the Liaison Section of the American Embassy in Madrid, Spain: "This office has information on a Diko DIMITROFF, who may be identical with Subjeet's (GERALEXIS') former husband. A source of unknown reliability reported in 1965 that Diko DIMITROFF had connections with the Bulgarian Intelligence Service and with a dissident group in Bulgaria. DIMITROFF represents himself as a film producer".

4. The only remotely identifiable traces at Athens Station are on a Dimitri DIMITROV aka Dimitur Adamov DIMITROV, DOB circa 1920, who was a member of the Bulgarian Agrarian Party and a student who fled to Greece in 1946. (Source: PGA-4769 of 8 March 1950, file 33-5-2). He was in contact with the A.D. at that time and reported that he had an order to go to Washington for a time. The above is carded info only with a caption: "French I.S.".

5. Subject also has travelled to Italy, France, England, and Switzerland in connection with the movie industry, but we defer to Headquarters regarding possible notification of other field stations until after they have conducted traces. In the meantime we have informed LNEASE/Athens that Subject has no connection with WOFIRM

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief, Office of Security

ATTENTION: Mr. James Thompson, PSD

SUBJECT: General Dico DIMITROV

REFERENCE: Memo of 13 March, same topic

1. General DIMITROV called the undersigned on 30 March to say hello and request a meeting. We met for dinner at the Astoria Restaurant at 8 p.m., 31 March.

2. During the course of the evening, Dico said he had seen my boss. When I asked whom he meant, he replied, Dick Helms. He said he had known Helms for years and further that he had seen him that Thursday in order to find out his position on the new organization the General was in which was holding its first rally, the next evening in New York. (This organization has something to do with rabid anti-communism and support for the U.S. in the Vietnam war.) The General said Helms' position was one of go ahead; he had no strong feelings supporting or condemning such a group.

3. Dico made further loud comments about support for the war. Our waitress overheard and mentioned that she was leaving the next morning for Saigon to entertain troops and to find out what the war was really about. Dico made a small scene about how wonderful this was, etc.

4. The General is the most rabid anti-communist I have ever met. For him there can be no compromise between them and the Free world; they must all be destroyed. After continuing on in this vein for some time, he finally quit. Also, he stated at the beginning of the evening that he did not drink and then proceeded to have a combination of drinks fairly fast. He did not appear drunk, but with each drink he got louder and louder. The other diners paid little attention, however, due to music and other covering noises.

5. I have not seen the General since that evening. My mother saw him one time (3 April) just after his return to New York, but has not seen him since. She still contends that she never mentioned where I worked and says he must have put two and two together. Any guidance you can provide on this matter would be appreciated.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT : DIMITROFF, Dimiter Adamoff
(aka: DIMITROV, Dico, General)

1. This memorandum is for information only.

2. On 30 March 1967 the Subject, who identified himself as General Dimitrov, called your Office seeking an interview. During the afternoon of the same date two representatives of my Office interviewed the Subject in his hotel room in Washington, D. C.

3. The Subject stated that he was born in Bulgaria, is currently stateless and has applied for United States citizenship. He related a detailed account of his former activities as a Bulgarian Freedom Fighter; claimed that he cooperated with a United States military mission in Bulgaria in the 1940's and stressed the fact that his only goals in life are the elimination of the world-wide menace of Communism and the liberation of Bulgaria. He claims to have cooperated in the past with the United States Information Agency and Radio Free Europe and to have offered his services and those of his freedom fighters to former Presidents Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy.

4. The Subject claimed to have visited your Office in April 1962 as a result of a referral from the White House. He advised that he is currently a Vice-President of the Anti-Communist International and works closely with former United States Representative Hamilton Fish from New York who is one of the principal sponsors of this organization. Dimitrov is currently staying in New York City and advised that he came to Washington to congratulate you on your appointment as Director of Central Intelligence; to advise you that he is attempting to form a World Tribunal

to counteract the anti-American feeling which Betrand Russell is spreading throughout the British Isles and Europe; and to seek $50,000 from CIA to enable him to start production in Greece and Spain on a movie concerning the history of Greek mythology. The Subject claimed that, once he had successfully completed this film, he would be given world recognition and could then do what ha feels is his real goal in life, namely to produce filma depicting the evils of Communism.

5. A review of Agency files discloses that, during the period October 1950 through March 1951, the Subject was utilized by OPC in Athens, Greece and provided 21 agents for infiltration into Bulgaria. In early 1951, various operational and administrative difficulties began to manifest themselves and it was decided that the Subject should be removed from his position. In April 1951 it came to OPC's attention that Subject intended to sell his knowledge of CIA's activities to the French Intelligence Service. Because of operational security considerations stemming from his duplicity and personal make-up, it was deemed inadvisable to leave the Subject at large in Greece and it was decided that he should be transferred to the CIA holding facility at Fort Clayton, Panama. He remained thers until January 1954.

6. In May 1953, a CIA case officer was dispatched from Headquarters to Fort Clayton where he interrogated the Subject. It was determined at that time that whatever operational knowledge the Subject had of CLA, its methods, personnel and operations were obsolete.

7. On or about 12 Jammary 1954, while still at Fort Clayton, the Subject signed a Certificate of Understanding and was temporarily removed to Greece due to the termination of the holding facility and the fact that there were no immediate

possibilities to resettle him. CLA made a commitment to the
Greek authorities that it would not abandon the Subject in Greeca
and would take steps to remove him from Greek soil within one
year. Efforts were made to effect the Subject's migration to
Canada, New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere, but to no avail
After due consideration by interested Headquarters elements and
the Athens Station, it was decided that the most effective solution
for the Subject's disposal would be to let him immigrate to the
United States on his own under the Refuges Relief Act program,
but without any assistance from CIA.

3. Since his arrival in the United States, the Subject
   has come to our attention on the following occasions:

On 14 May 1957, the Department of State
informed CIA that the Subject had contacted
their Office and tried to interest them in
purchasing a featare length film script
and asked if a representative of CIA would
like to meet the Subject and discuss the
script. The offer was turned down.

On 28 June 1960, the Subject attempted to
arrange a meeting with the then Vice-
President Richard M. Nizon. A member
of Mr. Nixon's staff turned the matter
* over to Mr. F. J. Sheridan, Contact
  Division, Office of Operations. Mr.
  Sheridan interviewed the Subject st
  length, acting on behalf of Mr. Nixon's
  staff, with no CIA connection.. No
  commitments were made to the Subject.

On 29 September 1961, the Subject called the Office of the DCI requesting an appointment. The matter was referred to Mr. Sheridan who advised Mr. Hill of the DCI Protective Staff to tell the Subject that his story was a matter of record and that there would be no purpose in further interviews unless he had something new to add.

9. On 31 March 1967, in view of the above information concerning the Subject's past activities, a representative of my Office called the Subject at his hotel in Washington, D. C., and advised him that the resuits of his interview of 30 March had been passed to appropriate Agency officials and that if any interest developed he would be contacted.

10. No further action will be taken in this matter unless requested by you.

LUNCHING Friday with Diko Dimitroff and enjoying the exuberant presentation of his plans to produce-direct a $20,000,000 film saga, "The Loves of the Greek Gods," based on Greek mythology reminded this reporter of the time many years ago when a Boston exhibitor named Joseph E. Levine (whom we met through a mutual friend, WORL Deejay Norm Prescott) revealed his ideas of "how to produce and exploit motion pictures" with the result that the following week we printed in this pillar a paragraph in which we predicted Levine would "make mo- tion picture history by sheer showmansbin". After two months in Gotham, finalizing pre-production plans, Diko leaves Thursday for his office in Madrid where he'll set in motion his ambitious production on this epci to be filmed in Greece skedded to start in the Spring of 1966 and featuring 30 international stars.

Congresses In Winter. Congresses, like birds, tend to come south in winter. Our sunny Coast-six average hours of sunshine a day from November to April-- is becoming their favorite winter ground, so much so that a huge congress hall is now planned.

Following the fashion to pick sunny climes for winter work, the executive committee of the International Union of Architects have just spent six days at Hotel Pez Espada, fixing the agenda for their big annual congress in July, The summer congress, of course, will be held up north, in Paris. Flags were hoisted outside Málaga Airport and the hotel for each of the 22 nation- alities attending, including the «hammer and sickle for the Moscow delegate. The seven three-hour sessions, resided over by Sir Robert Matthew. were spent sifting subjects to be dis cussed at the Paris congress. An Interpreter sent along by the local tourist office withered under the cross- fire of languages, so an urgent call went out fo Fuengirola for Lana, wife of ex- Soviet painter, Sacha Lioutikoff, who speaks five languages including Rus sian.

Delegates took a day off for some sunshine and an extensive tour of the Coast. They mostly agreed that the Coast has some fine buildings, but sadly lacks a master plan. The Rus sian, Guerogui Orlov, said he was particularly impressed by Marbella's Ciudad Residencial, the State holiday resort for workers. Local Spanish reporters eager for an interview jound the Russian rather untalkative, though he did confess he. liked Flamenco. The delegates rounded off the busy werk with a dinner gala in the hotel, and left Saturday.

Gibralfaro Castle A Tourist Center? The ruined ninth-century castle on Gibraltaro, the pine-covered hill over- looking Málaga, is probably going to be urbanized as a tourist center. It has been suggested that an auditorium, with rooms for gatherings like interna- tional congresses, be built within the castle walls. The idea was put to Mi- laga's Mayor, Sr. Rafael Betes, by the Under Secretary of Tourism, Sr. Gar- cía Rodriguez-Acosta, during this short visit here last week. He said Gibral- faro's beautiful position and views should be utilized more. The Mayor later took a bird's eye view of the site from the helicopter of the visiting American flag ship, USS Springfield. Gibralfaro is a great favorite with. everyone. Tourists climb it to explore the castle, gasp at the breathtaking views of the town and harbor and eat at the State restaurant built just below the castle walls. The hill also over- looks the bullring and hundreds of malagueños climb it to take a free peek at corridas.

Winter Coursy For Foreigners. Below Gibralfaro's battlements, just a spear's throw away, lies the comparatively new Casa de Cultura where, on Friday last week, the Mayor opened the 18th Winter Course for Foreigners. More than 100 students have come from many countries for this extensive twn- month course in Spanish language and culture, which happens to coincide with Málaga's equally famous Winter Sports Festival. Students are lodged with local families and most days af- tend lectures by university professors, go on excursions and take part in all sorts of social and cultural events..

Tied in with this year's course is a three-week exhibition of paintings by live well-known southern artists with strong local connexions. They are Alberka, Barbadillo, Brinkniann, Irr nandez and Prinado. Gabriel Alber ka, 30, lives in Torremolinos and has

compared with $75,965,000 in 1962.

The AB-PT operating earnings for 1963 were $7,358,000 or $1.65 a share compared to $10,757,000 or $2.41 a share in 1962.

Goldenson explained the paradox of lower operating earnings when the record income exceeded that of 1962 as reflecting 1962-1963 tele- vision business and the cost of covering President Kennedy's assassination. He anticipated progressive improvement during 1964, better than 1963.

He noted, too, an improvement in theatre business despite a slow start in 1963. AB-PT, he said, con- tinued its policy of disposing mar- ginal theatres and attempting to replace them with modern units in growing suburban areas. The com- pany, he revealed, dropped 14 thea- tres during 1963-and opened three new ones. Theatres are under con- struction in Charlotte, N.C. and Sunnyland, Fla., and a third is on the drawing board.

20 JAN 1964

TO:

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security Department of State.

FROM:

Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: DINTROFF, Dimiter Adamoff /Aka: DIMITROV, Dimitur Adamov/

1.  Reference is made to the request received 15 January 1964 from Mr. Jessup concerning Subject. The files of this office contain the following information.

2.  Subject of your request is Dimitur Adimow DIMITROV, born 7 May 1924 in Medkovets, Bulgaria. He escaped to Greece in 1947 and participated actively in anti-Commmist activities among Bulgarian refugees there. He was described as being dictatorial and egotistical to the point of having delusions of grandeur. Subject felt that he could cause the downfall of the Communist government of Bulgaria and would become prime minister of the country thereafter. By September 1951, his behavior had become so peculiar that he was detained for mental observation and treatment. In February 1954, Subject was considered well enough to be returned to normal refugee channels in Greece and was transferred to the Syros refugee detention camp to await disposition.

3.  Subject immigrated to the United States in 1956. Since that time he has written numerous letters to the White House and government agencies proposing rather far-fetched anti-Communist schemes in which he inevitably proposes himself for the leading role. Whereas Subject is not regarded as insane and is not known to be disposed to violence, the above letters do indicate that he is something of a "crackpot" on the subject of anti-Communism. It is conceivable that he does harbor some bitterness toward Greece as a result of his detention mentioned above.

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR POLICY COORDINATION

SUBJECT: Activities of Dimiter Adomov Dimitrov in Greece

1. The following information concerning the activities of Subject in Greece was recently received from the field. It is brought to your attention for your information, and for such comments as you may be able to make.

2. According to a fairly reliable informant, Subject, allegedly acting on instructions from members of the American Embassy at Athens, has lately become very active among Bulgarian refugees in Greece. Early in October 1950, Subject visited the Lavrion Camp where he met with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been given a "charter and instruc- tions," by certain members of the American Embassy, to form a committee of five members for the planning and execution of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according to Subject, would be established in Athens and would cooperate with other similar committees which have already been formed in France, Germany and other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc."

3. Subject is further reported to have stated that recruits would come from among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party (Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. The members of the Leftist Agrarian Party (G.M. Dimitrov or "Pladne" group) and right-wing elements would be excluded. Eligible Bulgarian emigres would come to Greece from Western Europe to assist in the work, and prominent members of the Gichev Agrarians and of the Democratic Party would be assisted in escap ing to Greece (presumably from Bulgaria) to join the organization.

5. Subject also revealed that the members of the committee at present were: himself as president; Ivan Mitev Hristonov, secretary; Ivan Donev Ivanov; Dimiter Donev Ivanov; and a fifth member whose name was not supplied by source.

6. In addressing the group at Lavrion, Subject took frequent occasion to mention that the committee has its headquarters in the American Embassy where he has a room assigned for his own use. He also stated that the committee maintains offices at 13 Patission Street, 7th Floor, rooms 2-4, and he stated that eight Bulgarian-speaking Americans are already working at this address. Possibly in an effort to impress his listeners, Subject commented that his office had two Bulgarian typewriters and a car with U. S. A. license plates.

7. Following his address to the group at Lavrion, Subject and Ivan Mitev Hristonov, secretary of the so-called committee, prepared a list of prospective members of the organization based on their screening of the refugees at Lavrion on the basis of birthplace, education, military training, and similar factors, the list having been prepared for submission to the American Embassy for approval, according to Subject.

8. On 1 November 1950, Subject again visited the Lavrion Camp to inform his recruits that they would shortly be moved to a pleasant home in Athens which the Americans were repainting for the purpose. On the occasion of this visit, the recruits were divided into three groups, as follows:

a. A group of 10 men to specialize in intelligence,

b. A group of 6 men to be trained in radio in Germany,

and

c. A group of 15 men to specialize in sabotage.

9. On or about 10 November 1950, the following six members of Group "A" moved to Athens: Peter Zlatev, Krustyu Kiryanov, Ivan Hristonov, Ivan Gogov, Todor Djadiev, and one whose name is unknown. The others were to follow shortly.

10. According to our source, the radio group comprises Ivan Iskrov, Boris Popov, Georgi Nikolov, and others, while the sabotage group includes Serafim Vangelov Kouyoundjiev, Nikola Manev, Todor Nikolov Todorov, Marko Korchev and others.

## DIMITER ADANOV DIMITROV

Dimiter Adamov Dimitrov was born on 7 May 1924 in the village of Medkovets, district of Lom, Bulgaria. His father was a farmer. His primary education was completed in Lom. He finished his high school training in 1941-1942 in Sofia, and studied philology for one year at Sofia University (1942-1943).

In 1942 he joined a secret branch of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union. In 1943, he claims to have begun underground activities, due to persecution by "Fascists". On 2 September 1944, he emerged from hiding to begin work with various Agrarian leaders. After the events of 9 September 1944, however, he again went into hiding and began activities aimed against Communists.

On 28 October 1944, he allegedly was accused by the government of sabotage because he had agitated against the Russian occupation troops. During the ensuing months, he was arrested several times in Ferdinand, Vratsa, and Lom. When released from prison, he continued his illegal activities. His organizational activities often lead him across the Yugoslav frontier. Allegedly he worked in Vardar Macedonia in order to organize Bulgarian sympathizers for the Agrarian Party cause. In April and May 1945, Dimitrov was in Sofia. At one point he procured an illegal identity card add under the name "Boris Stoikov, a member of the 2nd Belgrade Shock Brigade", he toured southwestern Yugoslavia, "organizing Agrarian posts", and was eventually captured by the Yugoslav authorities and sent back to Bulgaria. During the elections of 18 November 1945 he spoke at secret meetings in Vratsa, urging the people to defeat the Communists..

On 16 August 1946, he was captured by the police in Sofia. He claims to have been kept eighteen days without bread and twelve days without water, and to have spent four days on an electric torture machine which caused temporary blindness. From 13 October to 11 November 1946, he was tried in the Vratsa court for having organized subversive groups all over Bulgaria and sentenced on four counts. On 2 June 1947, he was tried and sentenced to death by the Sofia Military Court. On 8 July he escaped from the authorities, and on 23 July 1947 he crossed the Greek frontier.

1. Biography

The following biographic details were supplied by Dimitrov
himself, and cannot be checked in Athens.

Dimiter Adamov Dimitrov was born on May 7, 1924, in the
village of Medkovets, district of Lom, Bulgaria. His father
was a farmer. His primary education was completed in Lom. He
finished his high school training in 1941-1942 in Sofia, and
studied philology for one year at Sofia University (1942-1943).

In 1942 Diko joined a secret branch of the Bulgarian
National Agrarian Union. In 1943, he claims to have begun un-
derground activities, due to persecution by "Fascists." He
claims to have worked closely with (Dr) G. M. Dimitrov during
the time. (This claim is partially substantiated by letters
written to Diko by Dr. G. M. Dimitrov in 1947.)

On September 2, 1944, Diko emerged from hiding to begin
work with the Mushanov, Guitchev, Moraviev Agrarians. After
the events of September 9, 1944, however, he again went into
hiding and began activities aimed against Communists.

On October 28, 1944, he allegedly was accused by the govern- ment of sabotage because he had agitated against the Russian occupation troops. During the ensuing months he was arrested several times in Ferdinand, Vratsa and Lom. When released from prison, he continued his illegal activities, which seem to have consisted in travelling from village to village, organizing loose-knit groups of Agrarians to withstand Communist pressures.

Diko's organisational activities often lead him across the Yugoslav frontier. Allegedly he worked in Vardar Macedonia in order to organize Bulgarian sympathizers for the cause of Dr. G. M. Dimitrov, and upon the advice of a certain General Kitchharov.

In April and May, 1945, Diko was in Sofia, in contact with Dr. G. M. Dimitrov, Nikola Petkov and Mara Raicheva. After Diko learned that GeMe had left Bulgaria, he went to Skoplje and asked American and English officers there to help him get to Bari. He did not receive such help.

Diko procured an illegal identity card and, as "Boris Stoikov, a member of the 2nd Belgrade Shock Brigade," he toured southwestern Yugoslavia, "organizing Agrarian posts." Eventually, Diko was captured by the Yugoslav authorities.

Upon the suggestion of "Gosho, the leader of the partisans of Greek Macedonia," Diko was sent back to Bulgaria. He escaped during this transfer and, although he was ill, he went to Sofia where, he says, he was helped by a number of people, including Peter Belgashki, an American Colonel named "Bekeles," an American Sergeant named "Bucky," General Craig and Mrs. Minnie Balabanova.

When he had recovered his health, Diko left Sofia and travelled throughout Bulgaria, organizing "secret posts." Allegedly he organised 250 of these throughout Bulgaria. During the elections of November 18, 1945, he spoke at secret meetings in Vratsa, urging the people to defeat the Communists.

On August 16, 1946, he was captured by the police in Sofia. He claims to have been kept eighteen days without bread and twelve days without water, and to have spent four days on an electric torture machine which caused temporary blindness. (His "indescribable tortures" are all described in detail in his book "The Liberation of Bulgaria." See enclosure No. 1.) Diko believes that he was not executed because the Communists wished to hold him as a witness in preparation for the trial of Nikola Petkov.

From October 13 to November 11, 1946, Diko was tried in the Vratsa court for "having organized subversive groups all over Bulgaria." The chief prosecutor was a man named Chernev, the presiding judge was a certain Pencho Spasov. Diko was sentenced on four counts: to death, to 15 years, to 6 years and to 3 years imprisonment. He was jailed and put in solitary confinement.

On June 2, 1947, he was tried and sentenced to death by the Sofia Military Court. Also, he states, he was tried and sentenced to death by the court at Lom.

In June, 1947, Diko was taken to a quarry in Vratsa where he worked loading rock. On July 8, he escaped from the quarry and went to Mesdra. In Mesdra he contacted the post which he had established there, and received help in travelling further. He went to Zverova and then to Sofia. While in Sofia he asked for and received some help both from the British and from the Americans. He claims that on one occasion he slept in the Sofia house of Jack Horner, of the American Legation. (At this time Mr. Horner was living in his summer home at Simeonovo.) Dike claims also to have stayed with Michael Shipkov.

On July 23, 1947 he crossed the Greek frontier south of Zlatograd. He gave himself up the next day at Shahim.

British authorities in Sofia had notified the British in Salonika, and they made arrangements for Diko to be admitted to the British hospital in Xanthi. After eighteen days in the hospital there he was transferred to the British hospital in Salonika. After a month and a half in Salonika he was sent to Athens. Greek authorities sent him to the refugee camp at Lavrion. Diko spent nine months in Lavrion then went to Athens, where he obtained employment broadcasting in Bulgarian on Radio Athens. His subsequent activities in Greece are discussed in section 2, below.

Diko speaks Bulgarian, Serbian, Russian, some Greek and a very little English.

## 2. Activities

a. Employment. Diko works for Radio Athens. He broadcasts every Sunday evening in Bulgarian. He receives 30,000 drachmae per broadcast. (60,000 if his text is also used in a Greek language broadcast.) Unfortunately, however, it costs him twenty to thirty thousand drachmae to have his text translated into Greek for the benefit of the Greek censor. Additional expenses.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

such as those for renting a typewriter and local transporta-
tion costs, give him a net return from this work of about sero
drachmae. In addition to his money pay, however, the Greek
Government provides him with quarters in a run-down hotel in
New Phaleron and it pays him 2800 drachmae per day subsistence.
(Generally, a refugee is not entitled to subsistence money if
he has any employment whatosever.)

Diko also writes articles for various Athens newspapers
(see enclosure No. 6) and has received money for them. Other
literary activities are described in section 2. b., below.

A Mr. Humphries, technical adviser of the BBC at Radio
Athens, allegedly has offered Diko a job with BBC in London.
Diko has refused to accept this offer to date, because of his
primary interest in organising refugees into a "Democratic
Bloc." Should he find it impossible to acquire funds necessary
for his continued activities in Greece, however, he plans to
go to London with BBC.

b. Publications. Diko is a prolific author and is at
present writing an eight part work on Bulgaria to be entitled
"Under the Whip of Stalin." The eight parts of the book are:

(1) The Liberation of Bulgaria
(2) In the Hands of the Militia
(3) Justice and Communism
(4) Prisons and Camps
(5) Agrarians and Communism
(6) Workers and Communism
(7) Army and Communism
(8) Church and Communism

Dike has already written parts 1, 5 and 7. Parts 1 and 5
have been published in Greece. They are enclosures No. 1 and
No. 2 to this despatch. Part 7 (enclosure No. 3) is being pub-
lished by the Greek General Staff and is at the printers at the
present time. Diko received about 3,000,000 drachmas for each
part of his book which has been published; he expects to earn
about the same amount for Part 7, and for subsequent parts.

Diko states that he has written the books which have been
published "for the Greek audience." He realizes that they will
not meet approval in the West, largely because they are too
emotional. Also, he has omitted from the Greek versions of
his book certain anti-Monarchist sentiments which he did not
express "for political reasons." Diko has re-written the first
two parts of his book "for the American audience" and is very

CHENS 588

anxious to have them published in the United States. Enclosures No. 4 and No. 5 are the Greek texts of these revised portions.

Diko refers to himself often as "the new Kravchenko - better than Kravchenko." The Peripheral Reporting Unit asked Mrs. Mary Johnston, former Press Attache at the United States Legation in Sofia, to read the Greek text of Diko's books and check on this boast. (Diko's books are available only in Greek at the present time.) Mrs. Johnston stated that "Diko is certainly no worse than Kravchenko.".... Mrs. Johnston believes that Diko is an inte- resting and graphic author and that -- if he could abstain from frequent use of Balkan epithets - his work might merit publica- tion in English. Mrs. Johnston selected a short passage from "Agrarians and Communism" as being typical of his better writing. Enclosure No. 6, "Incident in Vulchedram," is a translation of this passage.

c. The "Democratic Bloc." Diko is engaged in trying to organise a "Democratic Bloc." His present efforts are directed almost entirely toward Bulgarian refugees in the camp at Lavrion. Diko was made a member of the "P. D. Petkov" organization which was formed in Lavrion on April 30, 1950. (See CAS report E-3295, September 16, 1950.) He has taken over and expanded the acti- vities of this group, and now considers himself its leader.

Diko claims that he has twelve "hard core" members in his group and fifty-four interested supporters. He claims that he will have ninety supporters as soon as he can find the funds to print and distribute his program, and to provide other concrete proofs of his growing strength.

Diko appears to be an excellent organizer. He keeps up-to-date lists of all the Bulgarians in the camp at Lavrion. The Bulgarians are listed according to Diko's estimate of their political position. Thus, there is a group called Supporters, there is one called Potential Supporters, there is a group of "hard core" Gemetoists, a list of Nationalists, etc. Diko also files all of his ideas and correspondence and, in general, seems to have a good idea of what he has done and is doing.

Diko makes it a point to visit the camp at Lavrion regu larly, and to bring with him cigarettes and food which he dis- tributes among new arrivals. Allegedly, he tells these new arrivals that the presents are given to them because they are Bulgarians, not as a bribe to join his political group. "Ia actual fact, however," Dike admits, "this is a very successful way of getting people to support us." Diko claims that he pays for these little gifts himself; he emphatically denies having received outside help in this matter.

CONFIDENTIAL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 71

# SECURITY: CONFIDENTIAL

## ATHENS 588

The basic program of Diko's Democratic Bloc is to be found in the "Constitution of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union," as published in Sofia in 1922. Diko carries an old and dog-eared copy of this publication with him. Presumably a copy is available in Washington.

In addition to these basic tenets, Diko's group has evolved a supplementary program. The points of this supplementary program are listed on enclosure No. 8. In general, Diko's program appears democratic and idealistic.

Diko's group is opposed unalterably to the Bulgarian National Committee and to Dr. G. M. Dimitrov. Diko states that, although he worked with Dr. Dimitrov for many years, he has come to realize that Dr. Dimitrov is guilty of those same totalitarian and terrorist leftist practices of which the Communists are guilty. Diko states that the final break with Dr. Dimitrov came over the following incident:

Dr. G. M. Dimitrov knew that Diko had organized many secret posts throughout Bulgaria and, after Diko escaped from Bulgaria, Dr. Dimitrov asked Diko to name the posts. Diko thought it wise not to write down the names of the persons in charge of the posts, and was also suspicious of this request. When Dr. Dimitrov did not receive the information he wanted, he became very angry and "showed his true totalitarian hand."

(Diko has made available to the Peripheral Reporting Unit many of his files, including those on his correspondence with Dr. Dimitrov. It appears that he does know GeMe and that GeMe at one time thought well of Diko. For instance, in a letter dated October 31, 1947, Dr. Dimitrov spoke of Diko as a "here" and in a letter dated January 2, 1948, Dr. Dimitrov stated that he had sent Diko some clothing and shaving equipment.)

![XE 201-652]

At the present time, Diko is collaborating with the Paris group of Toncho Tenev and Vakrel Yanev. (The four Bulgarians in Lavrion who stated that they supported Toncho Tenev -- see Athens despatch 380, September 1, 1940 -- seem to be Diko's men now.) Diko makes it very clear, almost illogically and stubbornly clear, that he will continue to work with Toncho Tenev only so long as Tenev does not change his present program. Diko seems to suspect that Tenev might later evince "Monarchist" or "Gemetoist" tendencies.

Diko corresponds with Toncho Tenev, Vakrel Yanev and Yanko GNEV and Zhetcho Donev in France, with Grosin Danev and (Lt. Col.) Nikola Alexandrov in Italy, with Panayot Panayotov in Venezuela, and with other Bulgarian refugees. Enclosure No. 8 is a translation of part of the text of a letter from Vakrel Yanev, which


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

SECURITY: CONFIDENTIAL

throws some light on the activities of the Tanev clique and the Barev brothers.

d. Memorial Services for Nikola Petkov. On Saturday, September 23, 1950, Diko organized a memorial service in Lavrion, commemorating the third anniversary of the hanging of Nikola Petkov. Diko stated that about eighty refugees came to his church service. (Pictures of the occasion, see enclosure No. 10, indicate that about sixty were present.) The majority of the people in attendance were Bulgarians, but there were also a few refugees of other nationalities, a Greek priest and sacristan, and a few town officials.

The memorial service lasted for more than an hour and included a mass, and a speech by Diko. Diko claims that his speech was so moving that all of the refugees cried, including himself. Following the service, Diko laid a wreath at the town soldier's monument and the group repaired te a tavern for refreshments.

The cost of the memorial service, indicated below, was not inconsiderable. Diko states that he paid about half of it himself, and that the other half was paid for from collections among the refugees.

COST OF MEMORIAL SERVICE

|     |                            |                  |
| --- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1.  | Wreath                     | 100,000 drachmae |
| 2.  | Priest                     | 110,000          |
| 3.  | Wine                       | 40,000           |
| 4.  | Ceremonial wheat-and-sugar | 200,000          |

|     |                            | 870,000          |

It is interesting to note that no Gemetoists took part in or attended the memorial service. This was claimed by Diko, and corroborated by a Gemetoist who visited the Embassy early in October to complain about the "high-handed audacity of Diko in pretending to speak for Democracy." (Note: The Peripheral Reporting Unit had been invited to attend the Memorial Service but did not do so since it did not wish to appear to sponsor one refugee group as against another.)

3. Comments

Diko is a pleasant, hard working young man of average intelligence. He shows a politician's glibness which is extra- ordinary in a man of his age. He can talk for hours about


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

13-00000

SECURITY: CONFIDENTIAL

8-THENS 588

"Democracy," "our program," etc., without actually saying
anything, yet creating the impression that he is all-knowing.

As an example of Diko's awareness of the politician's
role, it might be mentioned that he now wears a well cut suit
of the finest materials, a pair of excellent imported shoes,
a silk shirt and a silk tie. Diko is buying these on credit,
at 150,000 drachmae ($10) per month. He claims that a good
appearance is necessary if he is to inspire the confidence and
cooperation of the refugees among whom he is working.

Diko is a rugged individualist and it would seem that his
individualism is his greatest enemy at present. He is intole-
rant and suspicious of others, and is the type of person who
would prefer to lead his own small group to suicide than to
follow as a private in a larger army whose aims were not exactly
his own.

There is a very great deal of the charlatan about Diko.
CAS spoke with him on two occasions, and then discarded him as
a "phony." The Peripheral Reporting Unit believes, however,
that, notwithstanding his superficiality and the exaggerations
to which he is prone, Diko has such an intuitive grasp of the
rudiments of political deportment and showmanship, and he is
so devoted to his self-appointed task of organising his "Demo-
cratic Bloc," that he might become an important Bulgarian figure.

"INCIDENT IN VULCHEDRAM"

Excerpt from Agrarians and Communism, by Dimiter Adamov Dimitrov

So one day Yamkov...(was)... told to go to the "Committee." The invitation was made personally by Tinko so that it would not have the meaning and character of an order. (He was the father of a Communist who probably had an important post in the capital.)

"We have missed you, Yamkov, we see nothing of you."

"Oh, well, business you know."

"Why don't you come to the office of the People's Committee so that we can sit and have a talk?"

"To the office? What would I be doing there?"

"Oh, having a talk."

"What do we have to talk about?"

"Well, as men and as fellow villagers we have much to talk about."

Fellow villagers? Yamkov felt his blood boiling and rising to his head. That expression "fellow villagers" struck his ears as an irony, as an insult. He felt he was being de- filed by the mouth of that sordid murderer; because it was against these fellow villagers that his mania and extremism had been directed and his fellow villagers had been killed on his instructions; killed by the rabid mob of the Party during its first onslaught. And among these fellow villagers whom this jackal had killed there were his friends: the kind priest, the teacher and the doctor, all those who were the heart and mind of the village.

"Like fellow villagers?"

"Anyway, like friends. ... I want to discuss something with you. It's necessary that I should have a talk with you."

"Now I understand. That's right, be blunt about it. At what time do you order me to be in your office?"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 76

"But don't take it that way, Yamkov. I am not ordering you, I'm inviting you."

"Okay, when do you want me to come?"

"Come this afternoon, unless you'd prefer tomorrow."

"Either today or tomorrow makes no difference to me. I'm coming this afternoon."

Before going there, Yamkov passed by the druggist's, the only survivor of the circle of intellectuals, and told him about the invitation Tinko had made to him. He was the only man with whom he spoke with confidence and with whom he ex- changed ideas. The druggist rose, shocked, from his desk, affixed his spectacles with hands which were trembling, then put his hands on Yamkov's shoulders as if they were expressing his love and anxiety.

"Be careful, my friend Yamkov. You are a bit hotheaded and cannot control your tongue. Mind you don't misbehave. Control your nerves, because we mustn't lose you. We need you, we need you. Your home and your family and your village need you. You must not be missing when the moment arises...."

Yamkov left, greatly moved, and with a decision to listen to whatever they had to tell him at the People's Committee without expressing the disgust and indignation he felt for them. He had decided to be patient, to swallow his tongue, and to listen quietly to all the filth of that social disgrace, Tinko, like a little pupil of the elementary school who is chastised by his master.

"The devil take him!" he spat with disgust.

At the People's Committee, apart from the two "eminent" Party members - Tinko and Yanev - there was a Russian organi- zer, a large brute with an elephant neck and with a well- shaved Asiatic head. Through his large nostrils, which rhythmically closed and opened with his breathing, one felt that one was about to see the size of his mind. It seemed that he knew who Yamkov was, because his grey eyes were con- stantly fixed on him, insistently and inquiringly. Tinko introduced him.

"He has a son too, a Party man, our man."

"Bravo, congratulations. Where is he now?" he asked.

"In ... (he felt like saying, Hell) ... Sofia," he corrected himself.

"Is he studying?"

Enciolce 7 ATHENS 588

"Yes, he is studying to become a doctor." (He thought to himself: "a loafer.")

"Fine," remarked the Russian with satisfaction. "In our set-up we respect doctors, just as we respect every scientist. We think highly of them. We give them the means to promote their science for the benefit of the whole and, of course, for their own benefit too."

"Yes, yes. You love them. I have seen that with my own eyes," agreed Yamkov, scarcely managing to control himself. And there passed before his eyes the tragic scene of the assassination of the doctor a few days ago.

After these words had been exchanged and he was sitting comfortably on his chair, the Russian opened his legs wide, assumed a serious air, and started the discussion. He spoke Bulgarian with great ease, like a Bulgarian.

"The comrades," he said, pointing to Tinko and Yanev, "spoke to me with flattering words about you and your home. You are an honest and industrious family, respectable persons, and such persons who know how to appreciate work and honesty are valuable and dear to us. It, is even more fortunate because, as I was told, you are on our side. This is only too natural, of course, since you have your son...."

"My son has his own ideas and I have mine," interrupted Yamkov, who had started growing angry.

The Russian pretended not to notice the meaning of the interruption.

"Yes, I understand. Your son, being younger and more progressive, went further ahead. Youth has the lead. So I was about to say...what was I saying? Oh yes, that you have a son who could go ahead if you, too, helped, and if you didn't it would be the other way. You understand what I mean?"

Yamkov felt that he was choking with anger, but he con- trolled himself. He swallowed his tongue.

"I understand," he said, between clenched teeth.

"It's good to hear that," added the Russian. "It shows that you understand things in the right way, from the proper angle, like a reasonable man and like a father." He looked


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

satisfied. He thought that he had scared Yamkov with his threatening insinuation. He thought that he had him now at his mercy.

"And now let us speak about the specific and interesting question for which we invited you."

"Let us speak," the other man agreed.

"People like you are valuable for us. You are exactly what is required in each village to serve as an example to be followed by others, to overcome the stupid hostility of the villagers toward our social system and thus to facilitate its completion. Such persons offer an immense service to our cause. That is why we give them our respect and our confidence, and we reward them richly, both morally and materially. We know how to honor honest men."

"Yes, indeed. I can see that," said Yamkov and threw a glance at the other two "honest men," Yanev and Tinko.

Yamkov's highly expressive hint did not escape the attention of the Russian, but he pretended not to understand. The two "honest men" went red to the roots of their ears and their eyes sparked with anger.

"After all this," the Russian went on, "the only thing that remains is for me to tell you about my proposal. You should enter the kolkhoz. There you will be able to develop all your activity, you will benefit the social whole and you will create the fundamental pre-requisites for the proper development and progress of your son."

Yamkov rose. From the first words the Russian organiser had uttered he understood what he was about to come to. And, of course, he did not intend to accept the proposal for participation in the kolkhos but had intended - following the advice of his friend, the druggist - to express his refusal in quiet and well chosen words. But when the Russian had made his son's progress dependent upon his own consent to become an organ of the party - thus indirectly blackmailing him -, and especially when he clearly intimated that he wanted him to use as the bait for his fellow villagers, his honest and pure soul revolted. The wave of anger which he-scarcely managed to control broke out like a torrent. The druggist's prescription was cast away, forgotten.

"It seems to me," he replied, "that your affinity with base individuals like Tinko and Yanev, and undoubtedly with others still worse, has led you to believe that all the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

# UNCLASSIFIED

Bulgarians are tailored to fit your plans. For otherwise you would not have spoken to me about moral and material rewards for my person, about coins of treachery, and you wouldn't have threatened me with the development of my good-for-nothing son. Oh no, Mr. Russian, you are wrong in thinking that all the Bulgarians take after your *comrades*. There are a few who cannot be bought, who do not give way to threats and do not become bait."

He put on his hat and left with dignity.

The others remained there, stupified and spellbound, looked at the departing Yamkov.

When he had overcome the surprise which had stupified him, Tinko got hold of his revolver and hastened to reach Yancho Yamkov, who was descending the stairs without being aware of this. But the Russian organizer stopped him.

"No nonsense. This isn't the time for it. We shall think over how and when and where it must be done."

And he did think about it. A few days later Yamkov was found dead in a field outside the village. He had been stabbed with wild ferocity.

Tinko and the militia made every effort to find the murderers. And they found them. They were two peasants, two stolid and incorrigible anti-Communists, who, according to their own *confession*, written and signed before the militia, had committed the murder because they were informed that Yamkov had registered for participation in the kolkhoz and because he insistently and persistently had urged his fellow villagers to join him. The two-murderers were taken away for trial and never reappeared.

Yankov's belongings, in accordance with a statement which he had "signed," were taken over by the kolkhoz.

PROGRAM OF THE DEMOCRATIC BLOC

1.  The program is based upon the policies of the great
    Agrarians such as Nikola Petkov, Dimiter Guitchev, Nikola
    Mushanov, Constantin Moraviev, Verdil Dimov, Alexander
    Gerginov and Alexander Stambouliski

2.  The Bloc accepts the help and collaboration of all
    Bulgarian anti-Communists who agree to work along the path
    of Democracy.

3.  The Bloe refuses to collaborate with Communists,
    Leftist elements of any type such as the party of Dr. G. M.
    Dimitrov, extreme Rightists, former Monarchists, Fascists,
    or with the Ivan Mihailov group. This Democratic Bloc must
    remain purely democratic, in the American manner.

4.  The Bloc will ally itself with similar bloes now
    being formed among Albanian and Yugoslav refugees.

5.  As soon as the Bloc can procure the necessary funds,
    it will prepare and publish protocols, resolutions, etc.,
    and distribute these both to Bulgarian emigrants abroad and
    to Bulgarians inside Bulgaria. The first of these brochures
    will explain what the Bloc is, what it wants and why it does
    not support Dr. G. M. Dimitrov. The brochure will ask for
    the help of all Democratic Bulgarians.

6.  "After the Bloc has proved itself", it will request
    help from the United States and from the Greek Government in
    penetrating and propagandizing Bulgaria.

7.  The Bloc expects to help annoy the Communists in
    Bulgaria and -- when the time comes to help liberate the
    country.

8.  When the country has been freed, the Bloc desires
    free elections under a democratic system, restoration of all
    personal freedoms, the adoption of a bill of rights along the
    American system, the restoration of private ownership, the
    abolition of cooperative farms and the abolition of the
    people's courts.

9.  The program advocates just and proper trials of all
    Communist leaders no terrorism.

10. In external affairs the Bloc advocates Balkan coope-
    ration and cooperation with all democratic peoples.

Enclosure to ATHENS 588,
October 13, 1950.

Letter from Vakrel Yanev, 37, Rue de Berne, Paris 8, France, to Dimiter Adamov Dimotrov, Hotel Action, New Phaleron, Greece, dated April 15, 1950.

## EXCERPT

.....I am here concentrating more on organizational work so that we can safeguard the idealistic purity of the Agrarian Union so heavily stepped upon and frightened by the self-willed and evil activity of the Doctor and those who circle around him. Here in Paris we finally have an Agrarian Union and we have published a circular letter in which we announce in a clear manner the division among the emigrants. I sent you some of these letters and am now again sending you one so that you can distribute it wherever necessary and to people who are interested. I will await your prompt advice as to how it is received. I know how the Barev people will receive it, but now this means nothing to us. The Bulgarian problem in its entirety interests us and we will not allow it to be misused on account of our National cause.

I have not started a newspaper yet, but everything has been thought out and I hope that early next month I can release the first issue. It is not easy. You know how poor we are and it is hard to get money from the poor emigrants... Newsprint is very expensive here. My material circumstances are not any better than before. The newspaper has been thought out in its serious form and contents, so many people will have to swallow their tongues.

About the National Committee: I have nothing in common with them. My opinion is that all in a very short time will be reorganized from the roots, if we honestly desire to do good for our enslaved homeland.

The temporary leadership of the Bulgarian Agrarian Union in exile has been formed to include Eng./Tenev, as also Dinko Argirov. The fight with the Barevites has started strongly and even though Dr. Dimitrov is on their side we shall continue the fight, and will not stop, because it is for the pure, honest triumph of overrun Democracy.

The activity on the part of the Barevites about which you wrote is this: they want to make a sub-committee and for this purpose they want Slavi Neikov as a representative. You see to what low levels they have reached and who are the leaders for the Doctor! I wonder why up to now the emigrants in Greece have not organised and picked out a committee there, which will promulgate common interests and not allow outside interference.

You had promised me that you would send me documentation on the bad activity of the Barevites in Greece but up to now you haven't done it, which has troubled me.. You know that I am very strong on promises. I believe the declarations you have made more than once and shall await the fulfillment as quickly as possible of these promises.

I had read in the papers about the killing of Marin and others. I'd like to have you acquaint me with the circum- stances of the emigrants and what are the fronts, which faces come out as leaders, what kind of attitude they take, etc. ...

# MEMORANDUM

To: Oliver G. Martell

From: Terence U. Nasmith

Subject: The Hanging of Lyle O. Kelly.

18 April 1951

1. The most serious accusation against Kelly is based upon the developments regard to Kelly's connection with the French. He told us about recent contacts he made with Pierre and Mrs. Florimond from Salonika. He denied that he had ever had contacts with them previously. We have learned from Ogive that, in 1979, Kelly worked for Florimond..

On Thursday April 12 Kelly stated that he was to tell Florimond by Friday, April 13, whether or not he would work with him. Kelly asked us for instructions. We told Kelly his answer was to be a definite, final no. In other words he was never to see the French again. We know definitely, however, that Kelly saw Florimond on Friday, on Saturday and on Tuesday. On Tuesday he saw also a certain French Assistant Military Attache named Piray.

Yani Kolomonos, Kelly's friend, stated that Kelly has agreed to meet Piray at the French Embassy between 11 and 12 o'clock on Thursday, April 19. At this meeting Kelly will (1) give the Frenchman detailed accounts of all U. S. intelligence operations of which he is aware, with special emphasis on Radio Gorianin, and (2) receive for this information 10 to 15 million drachmae.

It is imperative that this meeting be stopped. For instance, two of the Dreamer radio announcers are known to Kelly and hated by Kelly. Since they have relatives inside Dreamland, their our position should be as secure as possible.

Our Greek informant suggests, not without plausibility, that this effort of the French might be Communist inspired attempt to penetrate U. S. intelligence activities. The Greek bases his guess only upon the reasoning that normal French intelligence activities would not be so interested in penetrating U. S. work, since allegedly -- we are close allies.

2. We accuse Kelly also of manyyproven lies and of theft of funds. These malpractices, known to us through personal observation over a period of several months, include such things as the following:

a. Kelly stated that he wrote three books, for which he was paid a sum of money. He did not write the books as he himself has testified on the enclosed photostat of a document which he signed.

b. On one occasion

201-45145


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 84

b. On one occasion Nasmith personally gave Kelly $300 in dollars for an option on his books. Kelly signed a receipt for this. Kelly showed a signed copy of the receipt to the true author, stating that he could not divide the money with the author since, although he had signed the receipt, he had not received any money that Mr. Nasmith had forced him to sign the receipt so that Nasmith could steal the $300 for himself.

c. Money given to Kelly specifically for the purpose of paying salaries to the members of his Committee was not turned over to the Committee in its entirity. Kelly stated on several occasions definitely that he no longer had any connections with Greek authorities. At the time he was making these statements he was observed by our people to be going into the Aliens Directorate, Radio Athens, and other official Greek residences. (Note: We were ppřeasedtto have Kelly maintain contact with Greek officials; we dislike only his lying about it.)

d. On at least 4 occasions Kelly has stated unequivocally that he had no relations with Ibrahim Mohammed. A friendly Lobserver saw Kelly pay Mohammed gold pounds prior to Mohammed's recent trip to Turkey.. Furthermore, mysterious receipts have appeared in Kelly's accounts signed by Ibrahim Mohammed.

It is interesting to note that aroused by our continued interest in Ibrahim, Kelly has given us a long song and dance intending to force us to drop the subject -- about Ibrahim's being a Greek spy.

e. On one occasion Kelly told us about having received money from Major Nikoloupolos of the Aliens Directorate. This is (1) an obvious attempt to drive a wedge between our closely cooperating organizations, and (2) evidence of Kelly's untrust-worthiness.

f. Kelly has been warned pepeatedly to maintain as go od security as possible regarding the purpose for which he has rented offices at 13 Patissia Street. Nevertheless, Kelly has blabbed his business (and ours!) all over Athens, so that he isve constantly visited by all manner of unnecessary people including a galaxy of street walkers.

g. Kelly maintains constant relations with several people who seem unduly interested in our work. We do not att empt to dictate his friends but we do consider it improper when he deliberately lies in denying to us that he sees such people. (Example: A certain Papas, an elderly Greek who seems to be working with the French Mission here.)

3. In addition to the serious charges which we have against Kelly as indicated above, there is the additional charge equally serious but less


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 85

- 3 -

serious but less specific, that he appears actually to be insane, to be suffering from delusions of grandeur (meglomania). For instance, his many references to his future role as prime minister of Bulgaria, and his illustrative anecdotes regarding the purpose of the meeting recently held between the members of the Committee and Mr. Manfield.

4. It is recommended urgently that Kelly be removed immediately from circulation and that the Aliens Directorate be kind enough to discuss with us in the next few days or weeks what final solution we may evolve for the Kelly menace.

1.  Reference is made to your memorandum dated 25 October 1950 regarding the Subject and the background information furnished by your office, concerning him.

A check of pertinent Government agencies and the indices of CIA produced no information regarding the Subject, in addition to that furnished by your office.

2.  Conclusion and Recommendation: Due to limitations placed upon this office's inquiries, we were unable to develop any further information concerning the Subject since there is no indication in background information or in the results of a check of appropriate Government agencies and the indices of CIA, that Subject has ever resided in this country.

However, based on the lack of any derogatory information in the files of pertinent government agencies, and the indices of CIA, this office does not wish, at this time, to interpose any objection to the proposed use of the Subject by this organization, providing Inspection and Security is furnished with the results of the Field Check when available.

If the situation should be altered and information obtained from which an investigation in the United States would be productive, this office would gladly perform the same.

This memorandum pertains only to the assignment mentioned above. Should you desire to use this individual in a staff capacity or otherwise change his status at a later date, the matter should be taken up with Inspection and Security. In the latter event, it is suggested that action be taken, if possible, sufficiently in advance so that no delay is caused in the transition.

Transmitted herewith are the attachments listed below. If it should be necessary, for any reason, to return the attachments, it is requested that they be returned in a sealed envelope marked "Eyes Alone" to the writer.

1. It has been ascertained from the Chief, Special Security Branch, Inspection and Security Staff, that as of 19 January 1951, the files of CIA fail to reflect any reason why Subject should not be operationally utilized by this office.

2. In view of the above and due to the urgency of obtaining Subject's services, it is recommended that a Provisional Operational Clearance be issued for Subject's use as a contractual agent in Greece for political, psychological, and guerrilla warfare operations in connection with project QKSTAIR.

3. Inasmuch as there is a calculated security risk involved in using an individual on a provisional operational clearance, you should use precaution in handling Subject until a full clearance is granted.

DATE: 21 July 1953

SUBJECT: Lyle O. KELLY

1. In accordance with your instructions received through Mr. Donald F.
   Ewing, CSE/2, and in coordination with Mr. Mahoney of WH Division, I flew to
   DTROBALO, arriving there at noon on 26 May 1953, for the purpose of determining
   whether Subject has current operational information concerning SE operations
   and personnel that would make him a security risk if he were allowed to re-
   settle within the next calendar year.

2. Upon arrival at DTROBALO I discussed the case with KELLY's case
   officer, Mr. Philip A. Tocmey, and the Station Security Officer and learned
   that KELLY had been in detention until approximately 15 May when he was released
   from confinement and allowed to attend classes and live with other persons who
   are being prepared for resettlement.

3. Between 1300 and 1600 hours on 26 May, I reviewed the DTROBALO Station
   files on KELLY and made an appointment with KELLY's case officer to have a con
   ference with KELLY at 0800 hours 27 May. It was decided to use the office of
   the Station Security Officer for the meeting because of its invuherability to
   other agents and to the laborers who were working in the area. The Security
   Officer stated that the office would be made available for the time specified.

4. At 0800 hours 27 May KELLY's case officer escorted me to the pre-
   arranged meeting site and introduced me as Mike Vargas to KELLY who had been
   waiting in the office. The case officer informed KELLY that I had arrived from
   Washington, D. C. to discuss his problems with him and would endeavor to resolve
   all matters possible. KELLY appeared elated and in broken English said that he
   was very happy to learn that the organization (I presume he meant CIA) finally
   acknowledges him as a friend. KELLY stated that he has been waiting 25 months
   to speak to someone from Washington. The case officer departed from the room and
   left KELLY and me standing in the center of the room. I asked KELLY to be
   seated and told him that I speak Serbo-Croatian and inquired if he understood
   Serbo-Croatian. KELLY replied that he does speak Serbian and is glad that I
   speak the language also because his English was not fluent and he has difficulty
   expressing himself. All conversations hereafter were conducted in Serbo-Croatian.

5. I opened the conversation by telling KELLY that his reports and letters
   were received and studied very carefully at Washington and assured him that
   pressing duties made it impossible for anyone to visit him at any time prior to
   the present. KELLY replied that he felt relieved that he was not forgotten by
   his friends and that he could now reveal everything that has been a puzzle to
   him since his apprehension by the Greeks in 1951, and perhaps learn the causes

for certain

for certain actions that were directed against him. KELLY stated that he was imprisoned a few times and that he suffered terribly during those periods because of his inability to withstand imprisonment.

6. In order that I might have a clear picture of his background and initial contacts with the Americans in Sofia and later in Athens, as well as his associations with other intelligence services in Bulgaria and Greece, KELLY stated that he preferred to start from the beginning of his clandestine work in Bulgaria and chronologically bring me up to date on his activities and ensuing events. Since much of KELLY's discussion is repeated in a report he had pre- viously prepared and which is in his files and since a great deal of the dis- cussion had no direct bearing on the purpose of the mission, I will for the sake of brevity and clarity avoid those portions of his story.

7. According to KELLY, the highlights of his background and activities are as follows: When the Communist regime gained control in Bulgaria he realized the position the people of Bulgaria were placed in and that under Communism the people were not going to be any better off than they were under the Fascists or Nazis. The only salvation for the Bulgarian people was for the Democratic powers to achieve control and thereby extend their form of government to the Bulgarian people. He therefore proceeded to exploit Bulgaria with a view to organizing adherents into clandestine groups in order to werthrow the Communist government that was in control. KELLY stated that he had organized over 250 cells consisting of some 10,000 persons throughout Bulgaria and Macedonia.

8. According to KELLY, in 1945 he met the American General Crane in Sofia and the General requested KELLY to prepare a program of his organization out- lining its mission, functions, etc.. Upon complying with this request KELLY stated that General Crane informed him that his program was very favorable and that he (General Crane) desired KELLY to work for him. KELLY said he agreed and proceeded personally to exploit the cells of his organization in Bulgaria.

9. In 1946 while KELLY was inspecting units of his organization in Bulgaria he was arrested by the Communists and tried and found guilty on four counts and imprisoned. According to KELLY the only reason he was not given the death sentence was because the Communists had hoped to use him as a witness against Nikola Petkov, Agrarian leader in Bulgaria who was also fomenting unrest among the Agrarian factions. KELLY continued by stating that he remained in prison for approximately six months near Vratsa where he was tortured by the police in an effort to extract from him information on his organization and people with whom he was associated, particularly Americans. KELLY said he did not reveal the information which the police desired.

10..Early in 1947 through members of his organization he was able to make his escape from the prison. He made his way to Sofia where he tried to contact General Crane, but learned that General Crane was no longer in Sofia and that his replacement was a Mr. Horne (probably John Horner, Chaege d'Affairs A.I. of the Political Mission in Sofia). Through the Mission secretary, KELLY made an appointment to see Mr. Horne and when he did meet him Mr. Horne told him

that he was not

that he was not aware of anything that had existed between KELLY and General Crane, but for KELLY to telephone him several days later. KELLY stated that he telephoned Mr. Horne a week later but received no satisfactory response from him.

11. KELLY realizing that he was wanted in Bulgaria by the police for his escape from prison proceeded to work his way out of Bulgaria. He was assisted by one Fancha Fernandova near Plovdiv. On crossing the Bulgarian border into Greece KELLY stated that he surrendered to a Greek patrol who immediately channeled him through its interrogation center. During this process KELLY said he was approached by British Intelligence, a Mr. Andros (possibly Andrews) and Mr. Scott, and was told that the British had heard of his organization and wanted him to work for them. KELLY refused the offer and told the British that he preferred to work for the Americans. KELLY also said that the Greek IS had asked him to work for them, and that he refused them also. He was then placed in a refugee camp in Athens with other Bulgarian refugees.

12. In 1949 during KELLY's stay in the refugee camp he said that he learned the art of making trinkets as a trade and was allowed to leave the refugee camp and seek employment in a shop where he could continue his trade. He found a shop that offered him a job and he accepted. He stated that he had no intentions of making a livdihood in that occupation but it did give him an opportunity to get out of the refugee camp and continue to seek means to combat the Communists in Bulgaria. While on this job KELLY met a Greek woman by the name of Flora Vavanou who said she had an aunt who lives in Chicago, Illinois. Since they both wished to go to the United States, they decided to get married and, with an affidavit of support from Flora's Aunt, get visas to the U. S.. Their next move was to get to Italy through IRO channels.

13. KELLY claims that he did not know the Aunt's address or name other than that she was referred to as Teresa. KELLY said that he and Flora planned to separate on reaching the United States. According to KELLY, he checked with the IRO in Athens and learned that because he was a Bulgarian immigrant he was eligible for emigration through IRO and since Flora had probable means of getting him to the United States he decided to go through with the plan. He married Flora in February 1949 and by the latter part of March they were en route to Italy.

14. While in Italy KELLY stated that Flora communicated with her Aunt in Chicago who was preparing to process the necessary affidavit for their entry into the United States. However, during this period KELLY learned that Flora was pregnant and according to Italian Immigration officials she could not be considered for emigration from Italy until after the birth of her child. On learning this, KELLY said his whole plan had collapsed and that he could not go through with it. He decided to return to Athens and leave his wife with her parents. They returned to Athens in October 1949. A daughter was born in November 1949.

15. Now that he had returned to Athens KELLY's intentions were to earn sufficient funds ($2000) to build a home for his daughter. He was not concerned with Flora as he had married her for the purpose of getting to the United States. The marriage was to be a temporary affair as they were not in love with each other and had no intentions of remaining married. Our information shows that KELLY worked for the Propaganda Section of the Greek General Staff headed by Lt. Colonel M. A. Alexandrakis on his return to Athens. In order to earn money KELLY decided to write several books on anti-Communism. Since he was not fluent in Greek be sought the assistance of a Greek scholar who could translate his writings from Bulgarian into Greek. KELLY said he wrote two texts and turned them over to a Greek educator to translate.

16. In august 1950 KELLY decided to take his texts to the American Embassy in Athens and inquire as to the possibility of having the texts translated into English and published in the United States. He said he was directed to a Mr. Ewning (probably Mr. Donald F. Ewing), Chief of Information Service, who in turn introduced him to a Mr. Willard Allan also an official at the American Embassy in Athens. KELLY stated that after several meetings with Mr. Allan he was asked by Mr. Allan to work with the Americans. KELLY immediately volunteered and was told in order to get an organization that could accomplish its mission he would need several assistants. He explored the Lavrion refugee camp for potential staff personnel and was given the names of Ivan Hristonov and Ivan and Dimitur Donev. Upon the suggestion of the Americans, KELLY said he accepted the persons named. He established a headquarters and proceeded planning operations to penetrate Bulgaria. KELLY claimed the Greeks and certain Bulgarian emigre leaders in Greece were opposed to his position with the Americans and did averything possible to belittle his position and impair his operations. The results of KELLY's abortive missions into Bulgaria are contained in a report which KELLY prepared at DTROBALO and which is now in his file.

17. During the period in which he was trying to get his operations mounted into Bulgaria, KELLY was approached by the French IS to work for them. KELLY stated that he immediately informed his American superiors regarding the French approach and was thereafter directed by the Americans in his dealings and associations with the French IS.

18. KELLY listed the following American personnel with whom he coordinated all his activities: The Chief, name unknown to KELLY -probably Mr. MacLean, Mr. Willard Allan, Miss Vera George (Mr. Allan's secretary), Mrs. Kingsley (connected with the Radio Station), Mr. George and Mr. Clef (training officers). KELLY referred to the following Bulgarian personnel as having been associated with his organization and with whom he was acquainted: Ivan Hristonov, whom he believes supplanted him in the organization in Athens; Ivan and Dimitur Donev, whom he claims are presently in Argentina; Choyo. Stonovski (probably Stoyo Chonovski); Andon Andonov; Gospodin Gospodinov; Hristo Traikov; Vasil Yanchev; Rafail Karakachanov; Dimitur Tabakov; Todor Hadjiev and Ivan Gagov.

19. KELLY continued by stating that he was apprehended by the Greek Police, allegedly for safe keeping in April 1951. He was placed in detention and remained under Greek control until his departure from Greece to Frankfurt by air. From Frankfurt he was transported to Panama where he arrived on 5 September 1951. He was placed in detention at a hospital in Panama and was of the opinion that perhaps the hospital was an exterminating establishment for undesirables. Later, however, he said he learned otherwise and through a friend, Mr. Stanley, learned that he was sent to Panama to undergo several physical check-ups and that after that was completed he would be removed to an area some 50 miles away where he would enjoy full freedom. Also that he would remain at his new location long enough to learn a language and prepare himself for resettlement. When he inquired how long that would be he was told that would be about six months.

20. In March 1952 KELLY was transferred to DTROBALO. He stated that he remained at DTROBALO for six months and after that period he confronted the authorities concerning his release and resettlement. Approximately one month later KELLY said he informed the Station authorities that he would leave the area if they did not release him as initially promised. He stated that he was apprehended and placed in confinement until his release in May 1953.

21. KELLY advised that the above is a true account of his past experiences and in view of my limited stay in DTROBALO would appreciate any answer I could give him regarding questions that have never been resolved and consequently have disturbed him. KELLY apparently had a list of questions prepared which he drew from a notebook and proceeded to read. The questions were as follows:

a. Why was he apprehended by the Greek Police?

b. Why was he placed in confinement in Panama and later at DTROBALO?

c. How much longer must he remain at DTROBALO?

d. Is there any possibility of his working with the organization (CIA) to complete the mission he initiated?

e. What happened to the texts he wrote that were taken to the United States by Mr. Willard Allan?

f. Why haven't any of his old friends visited him during the past two years?

g. In regards to his family --KELLY stated that only as a last resort and only if he had to remain at DTROBALO would he want his family there. He would prefer working and saving sufficient money($2000) to purchase or build a home for them in Greece and drop the whole matter.

In response to the above questions I told Kelly that:

a. He was apprehended by the Greek Police because of his proposed negotiation with the French IS.

b. He was placed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 102

Security Information

b. He was placed in confinement at Panama to undergo mental and physical check-ups to assure his recovery from the ordeal which he had undergone. His confinement at DTROBALO was to prevent his contemplated and announced escape.

c. KELLY's stay at DTROBALO apparently is dependent on his qualifications to meet resettlement requirements. I told him I was not able to judge when he had fulfilled those requirements. There was also the task involved of finding suitable positions for individuals with varied skills in South America.

d. I told KELLY that there was no opportunity for him to work with the organization because the men and organization as known to him are no longer existent.

e. I told KELLY that I believe the texts were returned to Greece but that I would make a further check on my return to Washington.

f. KELLY was told that the people whom he knew in Athens and Sofia were no longer with the organization and therefore it was impossible for them to visit him.

g. I told KELLY that I did not know anything about his wife and child other than the fact that KELLY was married and that his wife and child resided in Athens. I again queried KELLY concerning his wishes regarding his family. KELLY asked how long it would take to bring the family to South America if that were possible. I replied that I had no definite answer. KELLY said that only if he knew he had to remain at DTROBALO indefinitely would he request to have his wife and child with him.

COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

A. I found KELLY to be a frail, nervous, alert, and extremely talkative person. During the twelve hour conference with KELLY I frequently interrupted him to query him on persons and activities he referred to in his story only to find him replying briefly and persistently requesting to be allowed to continue relating his thoughts and feelings.

B. In relating his story of the organization he established and members who comprised the organization KELLY appeared to have a clear and concise picture of operations he directed and names and descriptions of people with whom he had come in contactl

C. It is my opinion that KELLY knows little about operations in Greece. I believe KELLY was so wrapped up in his own abortive missions and personnel difficulties while in Greece that he paid little, if any, attention to operations that were running concurrently. KELLY mentioned names of agents who are bing currently used in Bulgarian operations; however, he referred to them as Bulgarians whom he had met


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 103

Security Information
-7-

whom he had met in Athens and tried to recruit for his organization, or else he had been told of them by other sources. In reply to queries and in his own story, he made no statement which would indicate that he is cognizant of current Bulgarian operations.

D. I feel confident that KELLY realizes that his chances of resuming his role in Greece are at an end and therefore he has resolved to do the next best thing and that is to contact a former Greek companion (Mr. Karapides) who is a successful business man in Caracas, Venezuela and seek employment. KELLY is eager to be resettled and to get out of DTROBALO.

E. I recognize that KELLY is familiar with certain former operations and agents involved in those operations which, if revealed to unauthorized persons, could become embarrassing. However, I feel that KELLY's knowledge of current operations is so minute that the security risks involved to our current operations would be very little, if any, if he were resettled. Therefore, my recommendation is to process himfor resettlement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: ASWING-CHTE OPERATIONS, Chief, FI/STC

SUBJECT: Lyle O. Kelly

REFERENCE: Memorandum from Acting Chief, Operations, DD/P dated
7 January 1953, to Chief, SE

1. Since this Division has no facilities for the disposal of hard-core cases, the matter of Subject's disposal was discussed with the Chief, DDP/Admin after receipt of reference. It is am instant arching the time offringt Mat any time in ss matting avionizemimp for the handling of sinh casesx.

2. For your information in making ultimate disposition of this case, The hear future this Division has reached the conclusion, based on facts set forth in the following paragraphs, that Kelly, if released from confinement, will be a source of serious embarrassment to CIA.

3. Subject, a Bulgarian refugee in Greece, was the principal agent in an ill-fated operation run from October 1950 to March 1951. The operation resulted in a major expose and trial in Sofia during 1951. The agents used were those selected by Subject, at least one of whom was probably an operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer of his colleagues.

4. Subject's behavior during his employment was extraordinarily bad and characterized by a complete lack of security and a conscious effort on his part to aggrandize himself at the expense of the United States and his fellow agents. Unfortunately, during the time of his use by us, he acquired considerable information about CIA personnel, operations and installations in Greece. He was permitted to come and go freely in the certain CIA offices in the American Embassy.

5. Through another informant the Athens Station learned in early 1951 that Subject had contacted French Intelligence officers in Greece and had agreed to sell complete details on U. S. plans for operations against Bulgaria for the sum of 16,000,000 drachmae. All subsequent information on this transaction corroborates the veracity of the original informant's stery including a French document secured through another CIA channel which shows that as early as 1949 Subject had been an agent of a Franch Intelligence network run by the Military Attache of the French Embassy in Athens.

6. At the urgent detention request of the Athens Station that Subject be removed immediately from Athens, arrangements were made for his transportation and incarceration at DTROBALO. To facilitate his removal, Subject was told that he was being taken to the United States for a meeting of important satellite refugee leaders. He was flown by CIA plane to Germany, and from there to Panama by U.S. Army plane.

7. The American case officer who handled him in Athens reported, "Early in our relations with Kelly we foresaw the need to curb him or eliminate him from our operations. Since, however, he was necessary to us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching him the while. Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He 'borrowed' and stole money from many sources. He lied to many people, including us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he persisted in considering himself the forthcoming Minister-President of Bulgaria." During his detention incarceration at DTROBALO, we understand that these same character traits have been evident

for some time

8. This Division believes that Subject's confinement should be continued indefinitely to preclude the probability that he would again try to contact the French or another Intelligence Service, foreign Governments, or the press in order to capitalize on the information he possesses concerning CIA, its operations against Bulgaria, the details of his removal from Athens and information of disposal methods acquired during his incarceration at Panama.

Re KELLY CASE

4 April 1952

1.  A well-placed, reliable source (A-l) has stated that the 1949 files of French Intelligence network "Ulysse" of Captain Michel de la Roncier (Military Attache of the French Embassy, Athens) listed Dimitri Dimitrov as an agent and contains the following information:

"30 years old, a member of the Bulgarian Agrarian Party. He is a student and fled to Greece in 1946. He was in contact with the British brothers Baret (or Barev) while the later were in Greece. He is a contact of the Aliens Directorate. He received an order from the Americans requesting him to go to Washington for a tie. His file contains two reports, one dated April 1949 concerning the military situation and the other dated 6 April 1949 containing an account of the Greek Government Council of Coordination. (Translations of these two documents was not made because the contents no longer seem to be of any importance)."

2.  His prior connection with the French in 1949 doubtless led Dimitrov to make the later offer to Florimond to sell US information for 16,000,000 drachmae. Florimond was chief of the other French network in Greece operating from Salonica while de la Roncier conducted French operations out of Athens.

3.  The Baret or Barev brothers undoubtedly are Tsenko and Ivan Barev, now worked in Paris and Rome, respectively. They are Bulgarians who have/and may be still working with the British.

SUBJECT: Kelly Case

1. In accordance with your request, the following information, which may be helpful in connection with subject's rehabilitation, is furnished.

2. All the information we have concerning Kelly's life prior to his arrival in Greece was furnished by Kelly himself and is almost wholly unsubstantiated. This, in brief, is Kelly's story: He was born 7 May 1924 in Medkovets, Bulgaria. He studied philology in 1942-43 at the University of Sofia. In 1942 he joined a secret branch of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union and worked closely with Dr. Georgi M. Dimitrov in anti-Fascist activities (a clain which Dr. Dimitrov has denied.) After emerging briefly from hiding in September 1944, he again went underground, engaging in antd-Communist activities in various cities and towns in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Macedonia. where he urged members of the Agrarian Party to take action against the Communists. In October 1946 he was arrested by the police, sentenced to death, but not executed as the Communists wished to use him as a witness against the Agrarian leader Nikola Petkor. On 23 July 1947 he escaped to Greece.

3. Further light is thrown on Kelly's experiences in a manuscript which he claimed to have written and delivered to U. S. authorities in Greece with the prupose of finding a publisher for this, and other, material. It subsequently developed that Kelly was not the anthor of these papers but rather had furnished information to a Greek friend (John Calavanos) who was the real author. A rough translation of one of these documents is enclosed.

4. Because of his undeniable organizational ability, tremendous energy and glib, but largely untruthful, salesmanship, Kelly was able to organize a group of Bulgarian immigrants in Greece into what he called the Bulgarian Democratic Blos. His use by this agency was believed advisable inasmuch as his organisation provided the potential for recruiting infiltration agents within a shorter time and with fewer political strings attached than any other emigre groups. Furthermore, his organisation provided a convenient name for use as a front to cover operational activities. As a result of the limited recognition and support. given him and of his bon success in providing agents, Kelly developed a certain megalomania and consequently lost his initial popularity through dictatorial conduct and completely unwarranted behavior as the future head of the liberated Bulgarian state. An American case officer who was intimately involved with the Kelly operations at this period has furnished the following statement:

SECRET

"Early in

   SECURITY INFORMATION

"Early in our relations with Kelly we foresaw the need to curb him or eliminate him from our operations. Since, however, he was necessary to us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching him the while. Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He 'borrowed' and stole money from many sources. He lied to many people, including us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he persisted in considering himself the forthcoming Minister-President of Bulgaria."

On the Kelly credit side, the statement adds:

"We suspected at the time that he was not the new 'white hope', but we needed someone through whom we could obtain bodies. We obtained bodies through Kelly and actually have accomplished some substantive work. Thus it must be remembered that Kelly performed a useful service for us."

5. The incident which made of Kelly an immediate disposal problem developed along these lines: In early 1951 Kelly informed a member of our staff in Athens that he had been contacted by a French Vice Consul in Salonica with a view to obtaining his, Kelly's services, for the French. We informed Kelly that he could continue his contacts with the Vice Consul until it could be determined what the French had in mind. Upon our ascertaining that Kelly's connection with the French was counter to U. S. interests, Kelly was instructed to break off all contacts. This he failed to do. In the meantime, a former Kelly man, who had become disillusioned with Kelly's misrepresentations, informed us that Kelly had agreed to give the French complete information on U. S. plans for operations against Bulgaria for the sum of 16,000,000 drachmas. All subsequent information on this transaction which our Athens station was able to learn corroborates the veracity of the account.

6. Although the extent of Kelly's knowledge of operations was limited, it was considered extremely undesirable to allow these facts to fall into French hands. Arrangements were therefore made with Greek authorities for Kelly's arrest just prior to his scheduled meeting with the French representative to whom he was to deliver the information and from whom he was to receive the money. In view of these facts, it was immediately apparent that Kelly was of no further operational use and presented a definite security threat, for he was revealed as the type who, in order to reap personal advantage or to curry favor with potential supporters, was likely to reveal to the highest bidder whatever operational information he had gathered. There have been no later developments which have changed our position in the matter.

7. Information concerning subsequent developments in the handling of this disposal case are already known to your division.

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with Col. Smith of WH re Kelly Case, 20 December 1951.

1. Messrs. Potts, Adamson, and Gregg met with Col. Smith on 20 December 1951 for the purpose of discussing a new development in the Kelly care and determining the future course of action in regard to the disposal of Kelly. The new development was the statement by the Athene Senior CIA Representative during his visit to Washington in early December to the effect that Kelly no longer constitutes a security hasard to current Bulgarian operations in Greece since the knowledge that Kelly has about Bulgarian operations is now outdated. At present as far as Bulgarian operations in Greece are concerned the main problem is to keep Kelly out of Greece and, if possible, prevent his direct correspondence with people in Greece, in order to preclude his interfering with and stirring up the Bulgarian emigration in that country.

2. It was pointed out to Col. Smith that in view of this new development, SE/PC feels that it is now possible to begin planning and effecting the permanent disposal of Kelly. Col. Smith indicated that he felt that no imediate solution would be necessary, as Kelly could be treated as an exploited agent and handled under the disposal and rehabilitation projects which the WH Division is now developing. Col. Smith felt that Kelly could be held for a few more months, if necessary, in his present location until these projects were approved. However, in view of the possible imediate and permanent solution to Kelly's disposal offered by his friend Johannes Karapides in Caracas, Venezuela, it was agreed that the following action would be taken as soon as possibles

a. WH would brief the Caracas Chief of Station and investigate Karapides.

b. WH would attempt to learn more from Panama about Kelly's relationship to Karapides.

c. WH should investigate the problem of documenting Kelly for

possible disposal in Careces.

d. SE/PC would attempt to check on Karapides life and
activities when he was in Greece.

3. During the discussion of possible solutions to the Kelly
   case, it was explicitly understood and agreed between Col. Smith and
   the representatives of SE/PC that responsibility and initiative for
   Kelly's disposal now clearly rests with the WH Division and that the
   responsibility of SB/PC extends only to that support and assistance
   specifically requested by the WH Division. It was further understood,
   however, that SE/C still has a direct interest in Kelly's disposal
   in view of his wife and child's presence in Greece and their present
   undetermined relationship to Kally's permanent disposal, i. e, whether
   it is possible and desirable that they join hin.

# PARTIAL-PERSO TY HISTORY OF LYLE KELLY

1. Financial Finagling in Greece

(a) In February, 1951, when Kelly was head of the Democratic Bloc, three of his men arrived in Athens, coming directly from IRO camps. They needed shelter, but had no money. They were put on salary, but it was not enough to cover the sixmonths advance rent which it is the custom to pay when a lease is made in Athens. Thus Kelly's advance account was credited with the amount of ($850, which was to be used to pay the rental advance. The three men were to pay it back in monthly installments.

Two such installments were paid by the men when Kelly was "interned" by our people. The men were then able to complain that Kelly had forced them into quarters best described as "very inadequate, insecurean and unhealthy."

Comparing the quality of the quarters with the amount advanced for rent, it becomes quite certain that Kelly made some sort of deal with the landlord in order to make some money.

It should be kept in mind that Kelly forced three of his own countrymen to live in these quarters, from which they were forthwith removed for health and security reasons.

(b) Just prior to his removal, it was discovered that Kelly had a cash shortage of over $100 which was not accounted for in any way. When an attempt was made to collect the money, it was discovered that Kelly had spent it on himself.

2. Manuscript Episode

In. December, 1950, Willard Allen, in accordance with a promise made to Kelly, brought with him to this country three manuscripts, ostensibly written by Kelly. Allen was to see what he could do to have these manu- sripts published here. Kelly hoped to thus exploit and dramatize hie escape from Bulgaria. He was given, by us, a $300 advance on the publi- cation of the manuscripts.

On December 14, 1951, in a conversation with Mr. Allen, it was learned by us that Kelly had not written the manuscripts at all. Allen learned this himself when the real author wrote to him demanding the return of his works. The author said that he had a statement from Kelly disclaiming all credit for the manuscripts. Furthermore, the real author had seen nothing of the $300 given to Kelly, although they apparently had agreed to go 50-50 on any profits realized from the publication of the manuscripts.

Et is clear that Kelly lied to us, and used someone else's literary talentsin the hope of gaining noteriety and money himself.

3. Relations with the French

In early 1951, Kelly informed our people in Athens that a French Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him in the hope of getting Kelly to work for his country. Kelly was allowed by us to continue seeing this man until it was determinedjust what the French wanted in the way of information. This point was reached, and Kelly was told not to see his Frenchman or any Frenchmen after a certain Thursday. We know definitely that Kelly saw saw his Frenchman on the following Friday, Saturday, and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 112

# Tuesday.

We do not know what was said, but from a source whom we have no reason to doubt, (an ex-friend of Kelly's who deserted Kelly and came to us to warn us of Kax the situation with the French) we learned that for a sum amounting to 16,000,000 drachmae, Kelly had agreed to give the French the names of all the American staffinvolved in plans to infiltrate Bulgaria, plus information on Radio Parakka Gorianin. Kelly was immediately picked up by the Greek Alien Directorate, acting upon orders from Henry McLean.

## 4. Reaction of Others to Kelly

(a) The Senior Representative of OPC in Athens, Sept. 1951

"Kelly was a notoriously insecure, disreputable, opportunistic individual over whom control, other than physical, was next to impossible to exercise..... He had a positive genius for troubke-making intrigue, rare even in this part of the world; his continued presence in Greece would have rendered impossible any oiling of the stormy Bulgarian refugee waters here. Kelly was tied in even more closely than other Bulgarian agents with the Embassy here.... and could be counted on to use that fact, a matter of common knowledge in the Bulgarian colony, to his own advantage and to the disadvantage of the best interests of U. S. Government policy."

(b) Chief of Station, OPC in Athens, May 1951

"Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially irresponsible Irish nature. Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to be equally stupid. Early in our relations with Kelly,... we foresaw the need to curb Kelly or to eliminate him from our operations. Since, however, he was still necessary to us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching him the while. Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn- he got worse. He 'borrowed' and stole money from many sources. he lied to many people, including us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he per- sisted in considering homself the forthcoming Minister-President of Bulgaria. Things took a serious turn when Kelly's committee, men he himself had chosen, came to us behind his back complaining about him. This became more serious when Kelly's closest friend,... deserbed Kekky and came to us apparently in an honest desire to safeguard America and the struggle against Communisn from further involvement with a character as shady as Kelly. Since that time we have kaakad examined more closely into the Kekly affair and have found more lies, more secret agreements, more stolen funds... We have enough proof of Untrustworthiness to have a complete case against Kelly. We cannot continue with Kelly. He is finished."

## 5. Kelly's Relation with his Wife

(a) From Chief of Station, Panama; "...it was learned through inter- rogation that Kelly has no particular concern or love for his wife."

(b) From a letter written by Kekly to his wife; "...I think of you daily and know in detail how you are getting along. I believe you under- stand this both by the money and by all that you are receiving, when you want it. It is I that arranged all that."

(c)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

(c) From Memorandum for the Record, 27 Nov. 1951, signed by Wilson Prichett; "Kelly's wife is being supported at the rate of one million drachmas a month through Alien Directorate by (BulgarianProject)"

(d) From a letter written by Kelly to a friend in Greece, dated 27 December, 1951. " ... I succeeded in leaving Greece, and freeing my soul from the slavery of Flora.... I want for the present that Flora will lose all traces of me."

(e) From Kelly's letter to his wife. ""... you should be happy to ask God to protect us from harm and to unite us soon if possible."

# MEMORANDUM

TO: Gerald I. Manfield

FROM: Terence U. Nasmith

SUBJECT: Lyle 0. Kelly

18 May 1951

It occurs to me, lying happily upon my hepatitic bed as I am, that some sort 65 a statement regarding the "demise" of Lyle 0. Kelly might be in order "for the record". I shall discuss two aspects of Kelly in this memorandum, apologizing in advance for the vagueness of the discussion which is due, I shall maintain, to my present horizontal position far from records, calendars and the recollectionful clink of the Ismailic gold pound.

1. The good of Lyle 0. Kelly.

In the summer of 1950 QKStair was in the ridiculous position of being unable to do anything because the alien support on which it depended, allegedly forthcoming from the reverend Dr. Glantz, was not forthcoming. In a bit of a tizzy, anxious to get cracking, we picked up Lyle 0. Kelly. We suspected at the time that he was not the new "white hope", but we needed someone through whom we could obtain bodies. We obtained bodies through Kelly and actually have accomplished some substantive work. Thus it must be remembered that Kelly performed a useful service for us.

2. The bad of Lyle 0. Kelly.

Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially irresponsible Irish nature. Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to be equally stupid. Early in our relations with Kelly, before I left LCDrink in October, we foresaw the need to curb Kelly or to eliminate him from our operations. Since, however, he was still necessary to us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching him the while.

Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He "borrowed" and stole money from many sources. He lied to many people, including us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he persisted in considering himself the forthcoming Minister-President of Dreamland.

Things took a serious turn when Kelly's committee, men he himself had chosen, came to us behind his back complaining about him. This became more serious when his "closest friend, a Flake, the man who had actually written the books for which Kelly took credit, deserted Kelly and came to us apparently in an honest desire to safeguard America and the struggle against Communism from further involvement-with a character as shady as Kelly.

The most serious matter, one which could not be ignored, involved Kelly's relations with the HBFairies. Kelly had advised us that a Fairy Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him with regard to working together. We told Kelly he might go ahead and continue his relations with this gentleman until we learned exactly what the gentleman wanted. We learned what was wanted and advised Kelly he was not repeat not to see the Fairy agent, or any other Fairies, after a certain Thursday. We know definitely that Kelly did see this Fairy on the following Friday, Saturday, and Tuesday.

We do not know what he discussed with the Fairy but we have no reason to doubt the word of his Flake friend which is essentially as follows:

That the Fairies were interested primarily in the names and numbers of all the players (us, that is) in plans for infiltration of Dreamland, in information on Radio Gorianin, etc.; that Kelly had agreed to sell this information to the Fairies for a sum of 16,000,000 drachmae and that he had an appointment to complete the transaction at 11 o'clock the following morning.

On this information we had Kelly picked up, and are now troubled with the question of disposing of him.

Since that time we have examined more closely into the Kelly affair and have found more lies, more secret agreements, more stolen funds, more of that good, Irish whimsicality for which Kelly is already so famous. (Note that even if the hearsay evidence regarding the sell-out to the Fairies is erroneous - although it is backed by several independent bits of substantial evidence - we still have enough proof of untrustworthiness to have a complete case against Kelly.) We cannot continue with Kelly. He is finished.

(It is pertinent to note that Kelly's committee, and his party in general, feel no feeling of loss since his removal from active politics. Not a single person has asked about him except his wife whome he continuously disowned who wanted only to know how she might get in touch with him to ask him for some money. The committee and refugees in LCFlake in general, are in much better spirits than they have ever been before. Kelly's removal is in every way a tonic.)

I repeat, however, that at certain juncture in our efforts, Kelly represented the first and only alien body we had and, however unwittingly and briefly, served his country well. One hopes he will eventually come out of his present habitat with somewhat stronger moral fiber.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Development of the Rift with DIMITRI A. DIMITROV

1. Biography: (See 104 CAGWU, dated 4 October 1950) Born 7 May 1924 in Medkovets, Bulgaria. Education-studied philology for one year at Sofia University, 1942-43. In 1942 joined secret branch of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union. Claims to have begun underground, anti-Fascist activities in 1943 in Macedonia and to have worked closely with Dr. G. M. Dimitrov during this time. After emerging briefly from hiding in September 1944, he again went underground engaging in anti-Communist activities, touring various cities and towns, (including sections of Yugoslav/Macedonia) and urging members of the Agrarian party to take positive action against the Communists. In October, 1946, he was arrested by the police. He believes the reason he was not executed was that the Communists wished to use him as witness against Nikola Petkov. On 23 July 1947 he escaped to Greece.

2. Initial operation: (See Athe 3200 (IN 46672), 25 October 1950) In October, 1950, the QKSTAIR Field Chief learned of Dimitrov through the local peripheral reporting officer and contacted him covertly. Dimitrov made six agents immediately available for infiltration operations. Three of these six were successfully infiltrated on 10 December, carrying leaflets signed in the name of the Bulgarian Democratic Bloc, the emigre political group organized and headed by Dimitrov.

3. Subsequent activities: Dimitrov has supplied an additional 21 agents for QKSTAIR infiltration operations, 15 of whom have just completed training in Germany and are being prepared for infiltration by mid-May.

4. Origins of OKSTAIR break with Dimitrov:

a. In Athe 4821, IN 30224, Manfield reported on 22 March that he was considering breaking off association with Dimitrov because he had become too unpopular and dictatorial and self-important. There were also indications of serious misappropriation of funds. Manfield felt that Dimitrov's group could continue to be utilized under the leadership of Ivan Donev Ivanov.

b. In Athe 5150 (IN 36130) dated 20 April 1951, Manfield cabled that he had had the Greek Aliens Directorate pick up Dimitrov and put him under protective arrest for the reasons indicated above and because Dimitrov was about to sell out to the French. (This was discovered through an OPC penetration of Dimitrov's organization.) He also requested instructions on how to dispose of Dimitrov for a period of three months, which he felt was sufficient time in which to render him harmless to QKSTAIR operations.

# SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

c. Wash 38789 (OUT 97616) dated 21 April 1951 stated that there were no facilities in the United States or Germany for handling Dimitrov and pointed out that temporary disposal for three months would be insufficient in view of Dimitrov's detailed knowledge of the names of present agents and his general familiarity with QKSTAIR infiltration operations. It was suggested that the possibility of indefinite confinement by the Greek Intelligence Service should be explored.

d. Fran 2910 (IN 36297) dated 21 April 1951 confirmed that there were no facilities in Germany for holding Dimitrov and suggested that he be assassinated.

e. Athe 5205 (IN 37092) dated 25 April 1951 requested further investigation of disposal facilities.

f. Athe 5282 (IN 37839) indicated on 29 April 1951 that Dimitrov had been transferred from the Greek Aliens Directorate to Makronisis where he would be held by the Greek Intelligence Service.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SK

SUBJECT: Source Lead - Dimitar Adamov DIMITROV

REFERENCE: K-4928

1.  We have been informed by the Department of State that Dimitur Adamov DIMITROV (aka DIKO) is presently in Washington, at the tourist hose of Mrs. Julia Rogers Smith, 2036 P Street, N. W. His visit to Washington is for the purpose of interesting any U. S. Goverment agency in a feature-length film script that he has written. Both USIA and the State Department, the latter due to both lack of funds and not within its responsibility, have refused Dimitrov's offer. Previously, the script was rejected by New York representatives of commercial filming companies.

2.  Dimitrov allegedly headed partisan units in Bulgaria and worked for American operational services during World War II, and claims to have known General Clark, head of the Military Mission in Sophia. He escaped to Greece in 1947 and continued his contact with the American operational services, carrying out *anti-Commmist work*. He came to the U. S. with the aid of the Queen of Greece and now lives in Newark with his wife and seven year old child. He is approximately 32 years old.

3.  The above is passed to you for your information. While State Department has not seen the film script, they will attempt to borrow it if you so desire. Dimitrov may also be able to provide information of intelligence interest. We should appreciate your comments as soon as possible in order that State Department not be delayed in discontinuing contact with Dimitrov.

Dear Mr. Dimitroff:

I was most pleased to meet you and to learn of your aspirations to bring into being an Anti-Communist moving picture for use-throughout the world.

From what you told me of the scope of this project, I must concur with the opinion given by the head of the Motion Picture Section of the U.S. Information Agency. This is a matter for a major studio.

Accordingly, I would suggest first that you prepare a one-page resume of your professional qualifications; second that you prepare in English a brief resume of your proposed film; third that you mail these for consideration to the heads of major motion picture studios, such as, Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, Paramount and 20th Century Fox.

Please accept all of our best wishes for your success.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Dimitroff:

Your recent letter to President Eisenhower, outlining a film you propose to make, has been referred to this Agency.

Officers of the Motion Picture Service have read your proposal, and feel that the film "Under the Communist Whip", as you described it, would require the spectacular and dramatic skills and talents of one of the major studios which could build into the film the drama and emotional appeal needed in a first-class theatrical feature. This film would demand treatment and re-enactment beyond the scope of the documentary films we produce for use in our overseas information program.

We have read with interest the material you submitted, and we wish you success in your project.

Sincerely yours,

- Contact Report. (THROWOFF/3, Lyle O. Kelly, GOHAVEN)

Reference: DIR 33889

1. Purpose of contacts:

a. On 8 January 1954, James P. Entler arrived in DTRABALO to contact Subjects. The primary purpose of the contact was to persuade Subjects to sign the Syros agreement which would result in their being confined to Syros under complete Greek custody and jurisdiction.

2. THRONOFF/3:

a. THROWOFF/3 was contacted on 8 and 9 January and related to Entler what had developed since they last saw each other in Athens in September 1952. During the course of the discussion the following pertinent comments were made by THROWOFF/3:

i. An unidentified Greek Gendarmerie officer told him that KUBARK and not the Greek authorities were preventing his marriage.

ii. He was sent to DTRABALO primarily for security reasons.

iii. He resisted efforts to teach him Spanish and a trade because he believed that he could not be helped by it, but he did request that he be taught to drive a vehicle.

iv. He was accused of threatening a fellow refugee with a knife (he denies this) and as a result was confined for six months.

v. He did not resist emigration nor did he insist on being returned to Greece, but he did seek to be united with his fiance.

vi. He will not resist emigration from Greece unless his staying in Greece would enable him to marry.

b. THROWOFT/3 was set right on point (la) above and the conditions of the Syros agreement convinced him that he was mistaken. Realizing that no other course of action was open to him, THROWOFF/3 reluctantly signed the agreemente

c. THRONOFF/3 was told by Entlar that this office has no objections to his resuming contact with, or marrying, his fiance, but that such action would require the approval of the Greek authorities,

## 3. Lyle O. Kelly:

a. Kelly was contacted on 8 Jamary and again on 9 Jamary at his request. Immediately after meeting Kelly on 8 January he made some remark that Entler and those who knew his would probably be working for him at soms future date However, when informed that he was being sent to Syros, he settled down and was most attentive. The following is a list of questions raised by Kelly and the answers given to him:

i. Would he be permitted to have his wife and child with him at Syros? Ans. That action would have to be arranged with the Greek authorities.

ii. What will prevent the Greek authorities from imprisoning him as soon as he arrived in Greece? Ans. The terms of the agreement specify that he will remain at Syros awaiting emigration unless he is involved in an action which is punishable under Greek law.

iii. Does the Greek government have any jurisdiction over him at the present time which necessitates his being returned to Greece? No direct answer to this question was given, but Kelly was told that it was necessary to return him to Greece under the conditions of the Syros agreement. (At this point Kelly made a statement to his DTRABALO case officer which indicated that he believed his marriage to a Greek women gave the Greak authorities jurisdiction over hin.)

iv. Is this office throwing him out completely or would they, in the event of war or some emergency, contact him in the future? Ans. This office will always keep & check on anyone who has ever bad connections with it.

b. Kelly indicated that he was anxious to discover whether the Americans or the Greeks were responsible for his being placed in confinement in Greece in 1951, and the crime he was supposed to bave committed; he would raise this question should he meet any Americans (presumably from this office) while he is in Greece. Entler told Kelly that he was not familiar with this aspect of his case, but that in his opinion Kelly would be in prison now if he had committed a serious orine, Kelly was also told that he will serve no useful purpose by raising this question at a future date and he agreed to forget the matter

c. Several times during the two contacts with Kelly he asked that Entler give Kelly's best regards to all who know him and to mention that he would never forget them.

4. GOHAVEN:

a. GOHAVEN was contacted only once on 9 January. He was told that, in recognition for his past services and his excellent behavior at DIRABALO, those concerned with his case were making an effort to obtain his entry into the United States or the U.S. Army. He was reminded several times during the discussion that this effort may not be successful. He was also told that His transfer from DIRABALO was necessary in the very near future and in the event that his entry into the United States or the U.S. Army was still pending he would be moved to Syros. He was told that his transfer to Syros would be certain in the event that he was not permitted to enter the United States or the U.S. Army. At this point he was asked to sign the Syros agreement; he refused stating that he could not sign any agreement which indicated a voluntary severance of relations with the Americans. However, GOHAVEN added that he would not resist his transfer to Greece should the Americans desire to send him there. He pointed out that living conditions at Syros are such that his health would certainly deteriorate and, being a Bulgarian, he could not look forward to fair treatment at the hands of the Greeks.

b. GOHAVEN was instructed not to reveal to anyone what took place during the discussion and was told that he would without question be sent to Syros if he violated these instructions. He stated that he would follow instructions and would gladly sign a statement to that effect.

TO: Chief, Foreign Intelligence

FROM: Acting Chief, SE

DATE: 21 July 1953

SUBJECT: Lyle O. KELLY

1.  As a result of discussions between WHD, SE, CFI, and DD/A, it was decided to send an SE representative to DTROBALO to interview Lyle O. KELLY for the purpose of determining whether he represented sufficient security hazard to current SE operations out of Greece to warrant his being retained in maximum detention.

2.  In accordance with this agreement, Major Michael A. Hemovich was sent to DTROBALO where he arrived at noon on 26 May 1953.

3.  Major Hemovich discussed the case with the case officers concerned at DTROBALO, and then spent twelve hours talking to KELLY. As a result of this, it has been ascertained to our satisfaction that KELLY does not appear to have information of sufficient currency regarding staff or agent personnel, or current operations, in Greece to make his resettlement within the course of the next twelve months a serious security risk.

4.  We therefore recommend that Lyle O. KELLY be given whatever training in language and trade WH Division feels is required, and that efforts then be made to resettle him in South America. Our only request is that this Division be kept informed of the progress of this rehabilitation and be advised of the steps taken to resettle KELLY. In this connection it should be pointed out that KELLY has a wife and child in Greece. When queried by Major Hemovich about them, he professed no interest in having the wife or child join him, stating that he would like to provide some money for the support of the child if and when he got a job and could put aside some money for this purpose. It is therefore our intention to have KELLY write his wife a letter telling her that he has no further interest in her, that she should obtain a divorce, but that he will provide her with a certain sum of money for the child. (This sum will be provided by this Division and will probably be in the neighbortiood of $1000).

# MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Dimitri Adamoff DIMITROV

1. Subject was born on 7 May 1924 in Medkovets, Bulgaria. He studied philology for one year at Sofia University from 1942-1943. During the war he worked illegally in Greek Macedonia and Vardar, Macedonia to escape authorities. He returned home after the war, he was soon disillusioned by the Communists, and went to Sofia. Later he made a clandestine tour of Bulgarian towns and cities urging agrarians to take positive action against communism. Finally captured in Sofia, he stated that his life was spared because he was groomed as a witness against PETKOV. He escaped to Greece in 1947. He worked for the Greeks doing occasional propaganda under nom de plume "Diko."

2. In 1950, the American Embassy in Athens evaluated Subject as having a very great deal of the charlatan about him, and was considered a "phony." However, notwithstanding his superficiality and the exaggeration to which he was prone, Subject had an intuitive grasp of the rudiments of political deportment and showmanship and he was so devoted to his self-appointed task of organising his "democratic block" that it was thought that he might become an important Bulgarian figure.

3. In November, 1950, because of his background and experience, Subject was considered as an individual who could make significant psychological and political warfare contributions to operations in Greece. Subject was then very active among Bulgarian refugees in Greece. Early in October, 1950, he visited the Lavrion Camp where he spoke to the Bulgarian refugees and outlined the tasks that he was to assume, which included intelligence activities in Bulgaria, organizing an underground resistance movement in Bulgaria, and organizing sabotage activity against Bulgaria. Subject was not security conscious; he revealed the location of his office and told his listeners that his office had two Bulgarian typewriters and that he had a car with United States


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

license plates. In April, 1951, Subject was in contact with the French Vice-Consul and his wife, a French diplomat stationed in Athens, an elderly Greek who worked and otherwise had close connections with the French, and other Greek personalities. In April, 1951, besides his wife he had several other bed partners. Because of the operational security violations which had arisen, it was recommended urgently that Subject be removed from circulation.

4. Observers in Athens considered Subject to be too dictatorial and self-important and if he was not actually insane, he appeared to be suffering from delusions of grandeur. For instance, he made references to his future role as prime minister of Bulgaria. Because of Subject's neurotic, unstable character, it was deemed advisable to transfer Subject to Panama. Subject was taken to Panama on 6 September 1951 and was considered as a neuro-psychiatric case. On 9 October 1951, he began a hunger strike at midnight and did not break the fast until 9 a.m. on 14 October 1951. He asked that his former secretary in the Partisan Movement, who was located somewhere in Bulgaria, be brought to Panama. The doctors' concern, particularly the neuro-psychiatrist, indicated that they could not treat Subject adequately.

5. In February, 1954, Subject was returned to Greece. Prior to his return to Greece, Subject signed an agreement which would have resulted in his confinement to Syros under complete Greek custody and jurisdiction. (Attachment A)

6. In October, 1955, Subject sought admission to the United States under the Refugee Relief Program. Because years had passed since he had been in operational contact with Bulgarian refugees, it was felt that Subject should not be prevented from entering the United States.

7. Since entering the United States, Subject has been a continual source of embarassment. His megalomania is evident in the various communications with government agencies. For example, he recently commented in one letter that he would like to be appointed Richard Nixon's anti-communist adviser for Albania, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Rumania, and Bulgaria. He stated that he could liberate all these countries within five years if he were allowed

to work actively with financial support. His first objective would be to liberate Bulgaria, his homeland, make it a free democracy, and the 51st state of the United States.

Subject: Dimiter Adamoff Dimitroff - Renewed Effort for CIA Support (DIKO)

12 October 1961

00-A-3198985

1.  Mr. Hill of the DCI Security Office called Sheridan on 29 September 1961 to state that a Dimiter Dinitroff was trying to meet the DCI, and Mr. Bricker felt he should be handled by the Washington Field Office. Hill was told that Dimitroff had been interviewed at length in the Washington Field Office on 28 June 1960 after an effort to see Vice President Nixon (00-AS 3,161,567 under Case 33529). Sheridan suggested that Hill tell Dimitroff that his story was a matter of record, and there would be no purpose in further interview unless he had something new to contribute.

2.  Nonetheless, an appointment was made for 2 October 1961 at the Washington Field Office. Dimitroff was obviously disappointed to be sent back to Sheridan and admitted that he had been trying to find another entre to the Agency for his proposals. He pointed out that he was still against the Democratic Party but was in favor of President Kennedy because of his strong anti-communist stand, and bad been encouraged to resume his efforts by the president's appeals against communion.

3.  Dimitroff stated that he can keep his country of Bulgaria, Albania, Macedonia, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Poland in a turmoil against the USSR if given authority and backing by the CIA. He reiterated that he had been the youngest underground leader and vas imprisoned by UB eitizens in the jungle for three years for continuing his fight. Although his former contacts are now wten years old, he is sure that they can be re-established and that his former comrades vill rally to him in an active movement against the commmists, rather than to continue in passive roles.

4.  His latest plan is to form a Liberation Committee with himself as president. It would publish a Bulgarian/English paper for world distribution to Bulgarian emigres in an effort to alert supporters. The tone would be cultural rather than openly pelitical. He would also establish a central point to help Bulgarian refugees. With this under way, Dimitroff said that mihety percent of Geargi Dimitrov's (Bulgarian National Committee) follovers would defect to him. He said that Dimitrov is on the United States payroll and bad called him a traitor to Bulgaria last veek.

5. Dimitroff's real aim is to recruit five thousand supporters of fighting age. These would be used to invade Bulgaria by air drop into the southern mountain tier about April 1962. They would easily seize the cities of that area, which are held by mere hundreds of police and communist officials. The attacks would be at night and in sufficient strength to surprise and overwhelm the opposition. Proclamations would be issued, prisonars released, recruiting carried out and a border area set up in the mountains with the passes heavily defended. He said there are only four major roads inte this southern area, so that it could be quickly and effectively sealed off. The United Nations would be called to intervene imediately, as it has done in Korea and the Congo.

6. This enclave in Bulgaris would be the start of the overthrow of the comamist goverment in that country. When this is achieved, Dinitroff said he would want only five years as the head of the state to establish true democracy on the United States order. Thereafter, he would be happy to retire, having falfilled his promise to his followers that he would never give up the fight, He said that he was willing to die for the cause of a free Bulgaria and hopes that he can make it the fifty-first state of the United States.

7. To these ends he wrote a letter on 15 June 1961 to President Kennedy (copy attached). When he did not receive a reply, he called personally and was referred by a secretary to the State Department and then to CIA. Dimitroff needs funds and support from CIA and commented that if the Agency does not decide to support him in his anti-commmist work, he will try to uncover the names of the US citizens responsible for wrecking his underground activities and for holding him prisoner for three years. This, he said, he owed to his supporters because he has been able to do nothing without support.

8. Belatedly, he mentioned that he had written one of the greatest motion picture scripts ever. It is fictional but based on complete truths and is very strongly anti-communist. Unfortunately, he cannot find financial beckers and could use CIA money if his major project cannot be immediately adopted. The title of the piece is "One Dark Fight".

9. Dimitroff was informed that his visit and comments would be passed to any interested officials, and he would be contacted should there be any need to do so. He insisted, however, that he would remain in Washington for a reasonable time awaiting an answer and will definitely try to open other doors than those of CIA. He is using a letter drop and answering service - 422 Washington Building, DC5, ST 3-9474, in the pseudonym of Dimitriou. In the future he can always be reached through another name - Dimo Petroff - at 67 Richmond Street West, Suite 30%, Toronto 1, Ontario, Canade.

# MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Dimitur Adamov DIMITROV aka "Diko" DIMITROV

1.  A review of Agency files reveals the following data concerning Subject and his association with CIA.

2.  Subject was first contacted in October 1950 by the Field Chief of OPC activities in Athens, Greece. The purpose of this contact was to assess Subject as a principal agent and focal point in the recruitment of Bulgarians to participate in OPC operations directed against Bulgaria. For this purpose, an organization called the Democratic Bloc was established, and Subject was placed as its ostensible organizer and chief.

3.  During the period October 1950 through March 1951, Subject remained in the employ of OPC in Athens and provided 21 agents for infiltration into Bulgaria, but he never participated in the cross-border operation

4.  In early 1951, various operational and administrative difficulties began to manifest themselves and it was decided that Subject should be removed from his position. In April 1951 it came to OPC's attention that Subject intended to sell his knowledge of CIA's activities to the French Intelligence Service. This fact was used as the primary reason for his removal from active participation in Bulgarian operations.

5.  Because of operational security considerations stemming from his duplicity and personal make-up, it was deemed inadvisable to leave Subject at large in Greece and it was decided that he should be transferred to a CIA holding facility at Fort Clayton, Panama. He was airlifted from Athens to Frankfurt where he was hospitalized four days for observation, and then flown black to Fort Clayton, arriving on 4 September 1951. He remained there until January 1954.

6.  A CIA case officer was dispatched from headquarters in May 1953 to Fort Clayton where he interrogated Subject. If was determined at that time that whatever operational knowledge Subject had of CIA, its methods, personnel, and operations was obsolete.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

7. With termination of the holding facility at Fort Clayton, Subject was temporarily removed to Greece since there were no other immediate possibilities to resettle him. (The attached understanding with Subject was effected o/a 12 January 1954 at the time of his removal from Fort Clayton.) CIA made a commitment to the Greek authorities that CIA would not abandon Subject in Greece and would take steps to remove him from Greek soil within one year. Efforts were made to effect Subject's migration to Canada, New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere, but to no avail. After due consideration by interested headquarters elements and the Athens Station, it was decided that the best effective solution for Subject's disposal would be to let him immigrate to the United States on his own under the Refugee Belief Act program, but without any assistance from CIA.

8. Since arrival in the United States, Subject has come to our attention on the following occasion:

On 14 May 1957, the Department of State informed CIA that Subject had contacted their office and tried to interest them in purchasing a feature length film script. At that time Subject told the Department of State that he was living in Newark, New Jersey, with his wife and seven-year-old daughter and was in Washington on a visit. The State Department had no interest in the film script and asked if members of this Agency would like to meet Subject and discuss the script. This offer was turned down. The case officer involved understood that State Department then discontinued all contact with Subject. There is no further information available.

9. Although he was considered to be of operational value at the time he was originally picked up by elements of CIA, Subject's subsequent actions, lack of integrity and poor security indicated that he was unworthy of any further operational consideration. He has a tendency to exaggerate to the point of lying and become involved in deals of which he was the financial benefactor. Throughout all his deals, however, there is the thread of alleged national pride and desire to project himself in the fight against Communism. There have been reported rumors of his having been a Bulgarian IS agent even during the time when he was employed by CIA. No concrete evidence, however, was actually uncovered to substantiate these allegations, which are believed to be typical of denunciations made by rival political factions among emigres.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 136

10. As the result of the review of Subject's case, it is recommended that nothing further be done for him since he does not possess any damaging information concerning current operations and his memory of past operations and personalities is between nine and ten years old. (In view of the circumstances of termination, it should be pointed out to Subject that in pressing the United States Government for further assistance he is liable for prosecution under the espionage and secrecy laws of the United States Government.)

Case 33659 - Dimiter Dimitroff (Dike)

SECRET

1. On 27 June, George Barasch notified Sheridan that General Caramin of Vice President Nixon's office had requested an immediate contact with a Dimitroff interlocutor. Interlocutor had asked for an appointment with the Vice President and had indicated that he was a Italian underground leader. A meeting was arranged and an appointment was set for the Washington Office at 10 AM on 28 June.

2. On 28 June, Sabastiano announced and it turned out that his man is actually "Tom, Ad, Dimitroff". He explained, by way of introduction, that he was an important underground leader in Bulgaria during and after World War II; had had a long history of anti-Communist activities, and was very anxious that Vice President Nixon be elected President. Hin felt that Nixon was young, zealous, anti-Communist and commented that he would like to be appointed Nixon's anti-Communist advisor for Albania, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Rumania, and Bulgaria. He stated that he could liberate all these countries within five years if he were allowed to work entirely with financial support, but without pay to himself. His first objective is to liberate Bulgaria, his homeland; make it a free democracy, and even afford the dream of becoming the fifty-first US state.

3. Dimitroff then gave his detailed history. In 1941 when he was about 25 years old, he had just discovered his talents as a poet at about the time the German military forces took over the country. He proceeded to criticize the Germans and the Soviets in print, while promoting US democracy. Because of this stand he required a name and station. In 1943, the US and the UK sent a military mission to the Balkans under a US general who knew Dimitroff's purposes and tendencies.
   A meeting was arranged in the mountains and the general told Dimitroff that they were looking for such a young, vigorous leader who had the US viewpoint. The US would personally support him in all ways if he would lead an underground force. The general asked him to prepare the ground in Bulgaria for the US arrival when the Germans finally retreated.

4. On the basis of this meeting, Dimitroff found the Dembe Liberation Movement. He operated fairly openly and soon was seized by the Germans in the Macedonian Mountains. They wished to execute him, but the Bulgarian governor, Dimiter Raichov, told the Germans that the people would rise up if they killed "Dimo" (his nom-de-guerre and nom-de-garcon). He was therefore turned over to Raichov, who confined him to his native town of Lom where he was held for approximately two months and during which he lost contact with the US Mission. He finally

sent his to locate and tell the Mission to his situation. He brought his record to continue his efforts and escape if possible to the mountains. The guards were lax and he did succeed in getting away to revive his movement as the Bulgarian Democratic Rice, which was based on US democratic principles. At this stage, this same US military mission was also supporting Tito, and there were frequent military clashes between Tito's Communist and Dike's group. The general told Dike that Tito was fighting for the same cause but the general actually personally supported the Democratic partisans. He added that all would come out alright after the war.

5. In 1944 when the Germans left Bulgaria the US did not fulfill the promise of going into the Balkans. The Soviets arrived instead. Dike's people begin to question his leadership but still tried to resist the Soviets, who rounded them at Shumen. The remnants retreated to the mountains to the north. Dimitroff went down to Colonel Beckless (ate) of the new US military mission to Bulgaria, chief of which was General Coverly (ate). Colonel Beckless knew nothing of the activity of the former military mission which by this time was operating entirely in Yugoslavia. However, he was interested in supporting Dimitroff against the Soviets and the Communists. He requested permission and aid from Washington but no word was forthcoming for months. Dimitroff therefore went to Yugoslavia and not General Coverly.

Coverly was superior to the original US general Dimitroff had met. Coverly would not help him because of area jurisdiction.

6. Throughout the winter Dimitroff's group supplied themselves with guns stolen from military stores in Bulgaria and started their fight again in the Spring of 1945. Dimitroff heard that his original US general was in Yugoslavia and journeyed east to meet him. He was again told that the general had no jurisdiction any longer for Bulgaria. On the way to say goodbye to the general, Dimitroff was seized by Tito's police and put in jail for 45 days on bread and sauerkraut. He was interrogated on his contacts with the US Mission during this time. The Bulgarian Communist Government wanted Dimitroff alive as the Yugoslavs turned him over at the border to a Bulgarian lieutenant colonel. Dimitroff persuaded the colonel to defect and they both went to Colonel Beckless' house, where Dimitroff remained to recover his health and the lieutenant colonel went to Turkey. With Beckless' assistance Dimitroff opened his underground headquarters in a convent about two miles from Sofia, although there was still no concrete aid from Washington. His people in the mountains were desperate and began to break up.

7. At this time the military mission was reduced out of the country and was replaced by a US civilian group headed by a Mr. Gregorieff. After several meetings Gregorieff finally told Dimitroff he should no longer fight the Soviets that he would get no support from the US; that Gregorieff would not ask Washington for help and Dimitroff should give himself up. On the basis of this meeting Dimitroff considers Gregorieff a Communist. Dimitroff went to Sofia to meet Ambassador Barnes to express his suspicions about Gregorieff and to complain about the false

promises of over a year. Before he could meet the Ambassador, Dimitroff was betrayed at his safe house in Sofia by the landlady for one million leva, and vas arrested by the Bulgarian secret police. He was tortured by electricity, physical means, water, devices, and starvation. During this time he was regularly questioned by a Soviet Commissar bub told nothing because he knew he was to die and had to create an example. Finally sentenced to death by hanging, he waited daily for nine months for it to be carried out. Later he learned he had not been executed because the authorities wanted him to testify at the trial of Nikola Petkov that Petkov had supported Dimitroff's movement.

8. In 1947 ha vas vorking in a labor gang and was rescued by the underground, which sent him to the house of the US Ambassador. Arrangements vere made through Us personnel, over a period of two weeks, to send Dimitroff to Greece. He vas warned not to use his name "Diko" but did use his regular name. The Commnists offered a million leve reward for his death or capture in brochures with his picture.

9. In Greece, UK military personnel recognized him from the photographs and took him from a Greek hospital. UK General Scott met and offered him complete support and a radio station at Salonika to renew underground activities. Seott vas very anti-is and for that reason Dimitroff refused the offer. The following day all uniforms and gifts given hin by UK personnel were removed and he vas turned back to the Greeks, who employed him in a radio station in Athens broadcasting against Bulgarian Commmists.

10. During 1948, Communist agants were sent to Athens to kill him. For this reason he went to Italy at the suggestion of the Greek Government. In 1949 while at Bari, a Mr. Clark from the US Embassy in Greece, who knew him as "Diko", asked Dimitroff to return to Greece and to renew the fight with his underground if it could be revived. At its peak it had consisted of 250 secret posts and ten thousand active members. They returned together to Athens and set up an open Liberation Committee with Dimitroff as president. The organisation trained Bulgarians in Frankfurt and near Athens. Many of these were later parachuted into Bulgaria starting in 1949. His operations were purely military and did not involve espionags. Another US service in Greece, primarily interested in espionage, was headed by a Mr. Eving (sie) or Ubing (sis) for which all types of Bulgarians were working for money. When Dimitroff's men attempted to cross the Bulgarian frontier they were sometimes ambushed by Ewing's people or were betrayed to the Bulgarian Commamiats. To check personally he went on an inspection of the frontier with a US Army representative, a Mr. George. They talked to his people who had been foreed back and George realized that Eving was collaborating with the Commmista. George reported this to Clark who returned to Washington with the story and never came back to Greece.

11. Clark was replaced by a ltr. Allen, of German origin, Russian speaking, Moscow educated, and a Comamist. At their first meeting, Allen tald Dimitroff to take it easy, that there was plenty of time to fight the Communists. Thereafter it was apparent that Ewing vas 19 learning all of Dimitroff's plans, schedules, and seerets through Allen, and Ewing's people began openly to deride Dimitroff. This killed the

spirit of Dimitroff's people in the compa. George told Dimitroff
that Allen too was a Communist and cooperating with Erving. Allen
put pressure on Dimitroff for the location of the secret posts in
Bulgaria but Dimitroff refused to give the information. George
chased Washington to see who had sent Allen to Greece and learned
that it was a Mr. White, a Truman adviser who later committed suicide
for being a Communist. George took this information to the US via
Frankfurt and never returned to Greece.

12. Dimitroff continued to resist Allen's demands for details
    of his movement. Allen said there was no use fighting the Communists;
    that they could not beat the Soviets; that Communism was not too bad,
    and that it would be best to break up the movement. Allen denied
    being a Communist but said he would withdraw his financial support,
    to which Dimitroff replied that he could turn to other nations which
    had approached him. Allen told him to go ahead on his own. That night
    Dimitroff was called to a building near the Soviet Embassy where he was
    arrested by Greek police at Allen's request based on cable authority
    from Washington. After about a week Allen arranged for him to be taken
    to a Greek island to identify Bulgarians sent to kill him. At the
    island there were no Bulgarians but only a few Greek prisoners under
    guard. It was kept there four months. After a five-day hunger strike,
    arrangements were made by the Greek authorities with Allen to have him
    sent to another island where there were more Bulgarians. A month later
    Allen sent a letter to Dimitroff that he was leaving Greece but had
    arranged for Dimitroff to go to Washington. The two met in Athens and
    Allen gave Dimitroff a passport in the name of Christo Botaff, presumably
    because Dimitroff's life was in danger. Allen took him on a military
    plane from Athens to Italy to Frankfurt where they had to remain for
    four weeks because of the secrecy of their movements. At this time
    Allen ran down a German woman with his car and was held
    for trial.

13. Another individual named George then took Dimitroff from
    Frankfurt to the airport during which they changed cars six times.
    They boarded a four-engine plane secretly and Dimitroff was told he
    was hiding from the German police although only MPs were in sight.
    After landing at the Azores they remained aboard until no one was
    around before getting off for food. At Bermuda they changed to
    another military plane which flew him to Panama (1953). In Panama City
    he remained hidden in the tail of the plane, despite his protests, until
    a frightened US colonel in uniform took him by car to his house. Dimitroff's
    baggage and papers were taken from him and he was told that he had to go
    checked at a hospital before entering the US. At the hospital he was
    put in a room, which was actually a cell, and was checked by a Dr. Stetheed.
    He was told he was too weak to go to the US for a few days, and should
    rest. A man named Ivan Stanley came from Washington, told him not to
    worry about his safety any longer, that he would be well cared for by a
    US doctor and nurse and a US sergeant. He asked for books on English
    in order to be able to communicate. He had not been permitted to speak
    to anyone throughout the trip. Finally he was able to talk to Sargeant Barry
    (sic) who warned him that the group were a Communist ring and that Dimitroff's
    life was in danger. The Sergeant offered to help and asked Dimitroff not
    to betray him.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

14. Shortly thereafter Dimitroff was kicked out of the hospital without any of his belongings, having been told that they were taking him to Venezuela. Actually he was taken to Colon to an old abandoned coast artillery building. He was threatened not to try to escape and was left with five US civilian guards. When he became ill a doctor arrived and gave him shots. For the next three years he was kept there. During this period a series of US personnel arrived from Washington to see him. Finally he threatened to walk out and they could shoot him if they wished. At this, he was told he would be taken to Mexico but at the airport there was only an ambulance. He was tied and gagged in the Communist fashion and taken back by the ambulance to the same artillery area but placed in an old shell magazine under guard. He never had enough air although he was kept in the hole for seven months. The US guards told him that they would kill him when the time came. Finally he had serious pains in his chest and a doctor from Washington was brought in who diagnosed that he would die within twenty-four hours if not removed. He was returned to his old building for three or four months.

15. After President Eisenhower's election there was obviously panic among the guards and fewer were assigned. One day he found that there were no longer any about but he was afraid to pass yellow blazes on the trees beyond which they would shoot him down. Finally three new US individuals arrived and asked him whether he was alright. They stated that they were from Vice President Nixon's office and had come there to save him. They further stated that the Vice President had taken charge of his office in the White House when he took it over and had immediately sent the three to help him. They offered him a life pension and a villa in Virginia but Dimitroff was still afraid of tempting offers and preferred to be returned to Greece. The individuals brought him a suitcase of clothes and took him to a hotel in Cristobal. They reported to Vice President Nixon who ordered them to do anything Nixon wanted.

16. They returned him in the Spring of 1954 to the Greek authorities in Athens. He met a new US group who became very friendly with him and to whom he told much of his story. These included Nafiver of the United Nations, Debrich (sic) US Cultural Attache and some USIA officials. They assured him that he could go to the US as a free man without danger. He arrived in New York in November 1956 with the intention of writing his story in an Anti-Communist book. At first he worked as a janitor in Newark, New Jersey. At this time he met the Greek Ambassador who sent him to Spyros Skouras. Skouras refused to help, saying that Communists had never hurt him and he did not wish to be involved. Dimitroff also met, in New York City, James T. Martin, a US Immigration official who had assisted his departure from Greece. Martin suggested that he write President Eisenhower for support, which he did. The letter was referred to the State Department and USIA being ultimately answered by Turner B. Shelton of USIA. Dimitroff met Shelton in Washington to discuss the possibility of support in filming his story but Shelton obviously thought Dimitroff imbalanced by suggesting that he would be script writer, producer, and director.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

SECRET

17. Thereafter Dimitroff went to Hollywood where he appeared several times on television with his general anti-Communist story. He worked as a house painter while writing half of the book. Finally, without funds, he again wrote Shelton for a five-thousand dollar loan but received no help. When Vice President Nixon ran into trouble on his trip to Latin America, Dimitroff wrote to President Eisenhower again, receiving an answer from Casheen of the Vice President's office suggesting that he contact USIA. Dimitroff also made a card to the Vice President at Christmas 1959 wishing him well with the presidency, to which he got a personal answer.

18. Two months ago, Dimitroff received a letter from a Nixon volunteer group in California asking him to join. He replied with a request for five thousand dollars to complete his 4-500 page book which would help Nixon enormously with the presidential election. It would be published just a month before the election and would prove the immense bad inadvertently allowed the Communists to operate in the government; it would also show how Nixon had come out of his way to save our poor man. The book would show the dangers of Communism to the US. Dimitroff believes that it is his duty to finish and publish his story for the US people since it is proof of Communist activities.

19. Dimitroff is in desperate financial straits, being approximately five to six thousand dollars in debt. While in Hollywood he encountered a medical doctor - J. Hamburg, 1950 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles 5, California, Webster 3-3531, who produced motion pictures on the side. The two agreed that Dimitroff should write a script for a movie, which he did complete after borrowing the money to live on while working on it. When the script was presented to the doctor, Dimitroff's background was requested. The doctor then recognized him as an Anti-Communist Bulgarian leader and obviously did not like this fact. He insisted on discussing the advantages of Communism and described himself as being very liberal. The upshot was that Dimitroff never received payment.

20. Dimitroff told his whole story to Nixon's brother named Fream in California who thought the story important and would try to get help from rich friends, as well as try to arrange an interview with Cushman. Two weeks ago Dimitroff borrowed sufficient money to come to Washington to see the Vice President or his assistant to explain the value of his project and to make a desperate plea for financial aid. He stated that the Vice President must give him financial support or he will go to jail in California for debt. The way could come from US anti-Communist funds or he would be willing to borrow it until the book is sold. Dimitroff believes that every publisher would take the book to discredit international Communism. He needs 10-12 thousand dollars immediately to pay his bills, to finish the book, and properly to develop the necessary publicity.

21. Dimitroff believes that in talking to Sheridan he was talking to a member of Mr. Nixon's staff. He was answered that it would probably be impossible for the Vice President to comply, even should he wish to do so. Dimitroff refused to accept this, believing completely in the Vice President's authority in such matters. He said that he would wait in his hotel (Letterman's Tourist Home, 3030 F Street, N. W., Telephone: District 7-5663, Metropolitan 8-7131 where he is registered as Getsopolous)

for word from the Vice President.

22. Dimitroff added he only had three or four dollars with him but that he would borrow further and begged that he receive some answer by the end of this week. He feels sure that the Vice President, who sent directly to his aid in Panama, will assist him at this stage and he is sure that his book will be helpful to Nixon in the election. Dimitroff urged that this memorandum be closely held in the Vice President's office and feared that he might be endangered should the Democrats learn of it. He stated that he would probably also contact James Haggerty, the White House Press Secretary and George Allen, back of USIA, although he preferred to await word from the Vice President.

23. Dimitroff's home address is 1444 South Normandie Avenue, Los Angeles 6, California. He is heavily overdue with his rent at present. Dimitroff has applied for US citizenship but stated that if a Democrat be elected he would flee the country.

24. No commitments were made other than that Dimitroff would probably receive an answer. He has the Washington Office telephone and we anticipate a call within the next few days. Please have Mr. Hiram's office reply to Dimitroff or provide us with further instructions in view of the agency and political implications involved.

Dear Mr. Dimitroff:

On behalf of the Vice President I wish to acknowledge your letter of May 20 concerning your plans to fight Communism.

You may be sure that the Vice President sympathizes with your desire and your firmness of purpose; however, I must tell you that the State Department and the United States Information Agency are the operative agencies in this field. I can only suggest, therefore, that as you continue to develop your ideas you keep in touch with them so that they can give your projects careful consideration.

I know that the Vice President would want me to extend to you his good wishes and his appreciation for your generous comments concerning his South American trip.

UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY
WASHINGTON

May 12, 1958

Dear Mr. Dimitroff:

I appreciated your thoughtful letter of May 5 relative to the cultural agreement between the USSR and the United States signed January 27, 1958.

As you know from_talking with me, I am fully cognizant of the problems that exist relative to the Soviet Union and their relations with the Free World. It is, however, because of the serious problems that we believe it is so very necessary to reach the people of the Soviet Union by the means of motion pictures, radio, television and other methods of communication in order that they may have a better understanding of the freedom and way of life which we have the great honor and privilege to enjoy.

I assure you that everyone connected with matters relative to the purchase and sale of American and Soviet motion pictures is completely aware of the problems relative to these matters, as well as to the opportunities which are presented.

Let me thank you most sincerely for your interest and assure you that we will not fail to exercise caution and deliberation in connection with the implementation of this agreement.

Sincerely yours,

Turner B. Shelton

# GUARDS AGAINST REDS

# Refugee Lives in Fear of Tormentors

By DAN SWINTON

A square-jawed Bulgarian refugee said today he is living a life of fear and flight even in Los Angeles because of communist tyranny.

Diko, a panedonym that once ignited resistance to Red force, said that even here he had to guard against the vengeful hand of his Old World tormentors.

"They do not give up. Even in America the peril is great. I am always in danger," he said.

Dika is Dimiter Adamoff Dimitroff, five-foot five, 140 pounds. He spells his name with the double "f" because the Russians like to spell it with a "v."

He said he made one TV. appearance in Hollywood. Which was followed by a threat of physical violence, presumably Red-inspired.

The pocket-sized, hazel-eyed poet and writer once sparked the Bulgarian underground. His name flamed from resistance pamphlets to teach Red puppets that the pen can be mightier than the sword.

His mission today is to "show the free world how things were before and how they are now and what can happen here if the Reds take over. If they like the picture, let them go ahead and accept it."

He warns agains: the Soviet culture infiltration. "This is the biggest kind of propaganda. Let them show the prisons and the torture camps, instead of the ballets and the motion pictures," said Diko.

"I'in an anti-communist. I frel obliged to tell this story. the story I lived. I feel it would be a crime not to tell what Communism means to the average person's life," he says.

This story is wrapped up in a book Diko has written. It is based on the facts of his running fight in Bulgaria with the Reds; his imprisonment and death sentence in 1946 after a Four betrayal; his torture by electricity at the hands of the Reds; his forced starvation for 18 days; his forced thirst for 12 days; the slaughter of his parents because they bore a resistance leader.

He said Bulgarian resistance was grass roots resistance. "This was different from the revolts in Hungary and Poland," said Diko.

"In Hungary and Poland the uprising originated among the Communists themselves, Those among the populace who hated the Reds joined later. But at first it was an attempt to set up a Tito form of Nationalist Communism," Diko explained.

His first anti-Red unit in Bulgaria was the Danube Valley Organization for Resistance. This folded for lack of outside help. It was promptly replaced by the Bulgarian Democfatic Bloc, which survived from 1944 to 1953.

After Diko escaped from his 1946 imprisonment, he continued the battle from Greece. Four attempts were made on his life but he kept pounding out the fight talk in pamphlets like "Farmers and Communism."

In 1953, Uncle Sam offered him refuge in Virginia, including a house, a car and an income, he said. But he insisted on staying with the mountain people in Greece to guide the attack on tyranny.

Fourteen months ago Diko decided he must tell his story to the West. He came to the U.S. as a political refugee.

STILL IN HIDING

I have been writing my story. Besides, I have to be careful about disclosing my whereabouts," said Diko.

Yankee dedication to honesty and veracity may lose the cold war with Communism, Diko warned..

"Americans have to he tougher, rougher. They have to learn to lie the way the Reds lie. You can't pick up this snake with your hands," he said...

He hopes the message will get through. But he admits his urgings may not sail any ships. "I'm not as important as I was," says Diko. "But I'm still the same fellow."

26 July 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of Training Registrar

THROUGH: TO/ORD

SUBJECT: Evaluation of Contract Management Institute Course

1. I attended the Contract Management Institute on 28 to 31 March 1967. Immediately after that course I submitted extensive comments to Mr. Arthur Leach, DD/S&T coordinator for the course, and I understand that those comments were included in the overall recommendations for future changes.

2. Since three and one-half months have transpired since completion of that course, details such as the names of speakers and subject material are a bit hazy but I will repeat my overall reaction to it for whatever benefit it might afford. The course material was good although it could have been oriented much more toward technical project managers rather than administrative officers, to the ultimate benefit of DD/S&T. Two of the speakers were excellent; however, the third, who also was apparently Director of the Institute was very poor both with respect to his understanding of the material and his presentation. Dr. Kennedy of Notre Dame and the lawyer, whose name I do not recall, were excellent.

3. This was primarily a sales pitch for CPIF contracts. My personal impression was that U.S. Government contracting agencies have just about completed the circle of a great procurement fiasco. In departing from fixed-price and CPFF contracts to CPIF'S with various award arrangements, the contract negotiators were unable to really ever define cost and ended up invariably in giving away additional fees to the contractors for nothing received. Definitive costs were always a function of experienced and sound

Course

technical investigation and management of a contract and when- ever costs followed a nonlinear curve, most estimates became almost completely unpredictable. NASA and the DoD generally have, therefore, gone from CPIF types to CPAF-type contracts; the CPAF type ends up being simply another CPFF but with the contractor having the advantage in the establishment of an award fee and with the Government having no recourse to redetermination. My reaction was simply that the DoD experience simply reaffirms my own -- that for R&D there appears to be no good substitute for a well-managed CPFF-type arrangement.

Mr. Christ continues to lead the Applied Physics Division in a progressive, responsive and aggressive manner. Some turbulence is occasionally generated by this vigorous leadership; however, the record of solid and potential accomplishments by his group continues to be impressive. On balance, his creative, forward-looking leadership continues to be a talent suited for the goals and missions of this Office.

The technological innovations established in his Division are continuing to lead to a variety of items of great potential value to the Intelligence Community. His aggressive search for and application of other-agency funds has directly saved this Agency many hundreds of thousands of dollars.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Mr. Christ will be retiring 30 November 1970, Prior to 1970 he has generally been considered a capable officer and the list of his accomplishments during his Agency career is not unimpressive. Christ's performance, particularly in the last six months, however, has revealed critical weakness in judgment, discretion and self-evaluation. These flaws have been called to Christ's attention by me personally, and I deem them sufficiently serious that were it not for his proposed retirement I would be constrained to seek other means to separate him from Agency employment.

During the past year Mr. Christ has attempted to consolidate the large areas of responsibility in his Applied Physics Division which now encompasses effort in positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro-technology, and emplacement. He continues to be conscientious, responsive, and aggressive in the management and development of these technical programs. Further, during the past year giant strides have been taken in the coordination of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers. This coordination has been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction. On occasion his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order. However, his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in truly large steps forward in technical areas where the cost effectiveness cannot yet be determined. His judicious application of other-agency funds has directly saved this Agency many hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Mr. Christ received a QSI for his efforts during this reporting period.

MAY 3 1 54 PH '67

During the past year, Mr. Christ has expanded his responsibilities for his Applied Physics Division, which now encompasses effort in positive audiosurveillance, countermeasures, micropower-microtechnology, and emplacement problems. He continues to be conscientious, responsive, and aggressive in the management and development of the technical programs under his direction and supervision.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities, and it must be acknowledged that they are responsible, in large measure, for the forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction.

His cost consciousness is best exemplified by his detailed planning and charting of cost, time, and technical details in a variety of complex areas. He has taken the lead in solving many involved, detailed and intricate interface and coordination problems with virtually all other technical groups within the Agency.

I expect a high degree of intelligence pay-off as a result of programs under his supervision.

Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for 2-1/2 36:PM bringing the continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and Development, in which he played a major role. During the past year, Mr. Christ has given up his responsibilities in the Radio-Physics area and has devoted himself to expansion and growth problems of the Audio-Physics Division, which encompasses effort in positive audiosurveillance, countermeasures, and emplacement problems.

Mr. Christ continues to be conscientious, responsive, and alert to the needs of the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his direction and supervision. He couples this with a vigorous managerial attitude that encompasses the recruiting, programming, coordination, and other factors necessary to implement these programs in an effective manner. His cost-consciousness is a continuing effort throughout the year and is best exemplified by his careful over-all planning and charting of total program efforts in order that projects lead directly to productive intelligence efforts.

Mr. Christ has had an unusually difficult position in one respect, in that his technical surveillance effort was a major interface area with the DD/P in a realm where political and bureaucratic considerations could have deleteriously affected the content of his programs. He handled these problems in a manner that was favorable for the over-all good of the Agency in terms of technical progress in numerous areas and which far exceeded what might be called "par" for the course,

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about eighteen months, during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and Development. During most of the past year Mr. Christ has doubled as group leader of the Radio-Physics area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of a separate Audio-Physics group, both of which continue to comprise about 40% of the effort of the Physical Sciences portion of the Office. Mr. Christ has performed these duties in a mangerial capacity in an extremely effective manner, so that both groups are well developed and capable of continuing growth on a self-sustaining basis.

Mr. Christ is extremely conscientious, receptive, and alert to the needs of the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his direction and supervision. His cost consciousness is a continuing effort throughout the year, and is best demonstrated by the manner in which he has reprogrammed funds internally and reduced the costs of a number of contracts. Also, he is not one to "rubber-stamp" approval of contractor efforts, and has called several of them to task this year for what he considered efforts below what he felt their capabilities should be.

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about six months, during a difficult period of growth, expansion, and change in the Office of Research and Development. During the process of reorganization of the Office, Mr. Christ has emerged as acting group leader of both the Radio-Physics and Audio-Physics areas of effort, which comprise about 40% of the effort in the Physical Sciences portion of the Office.

Considering his geographical location for the previous three years, Mr. Christ has done a remarkable job in organizing the Radio-Physics effort and in developing a new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the Office. All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and organization of new projects with an extremely under-manned staff.

Mr. Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive in the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear ability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new objectives. In the development of the organizations necessary to implement these programs, Mr. Christ has demonstrated a high degree of cost consciousness by organizing personnel of the two groups so that with a limited staff they could operate in both programs, and by vigorously combing the country to locate the best contractors to implement the program and to seek advice as to appropriate sources for such procurement.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee of improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assigigger responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for retaining future personnel actions.

Subject is a technical man who combines a taste for action with exceptional competence, producing excellent leadership for the specialized branch he serves.
His treatment of personnel is direct, frank, unusually honest and just. He helps the men and their families in times of trouble and personal difficulties and has earned their respect for his technical competence. He is imaginative and bold in his approach to the responsibilities of his branch and is a fertile source of ideas. He has driven hard towards raising professional standards.

Although he is a good innovator, he sometimes pushes harder on new approaches than on completion of programs in being, and on occasion his devotion to a program leads him to heavy emphasis on it and too little on other aspects equally as important. However, this was in the earlier part of the rated period rather than recently. I believe he will continue to grow with his job and that he can undertake more responsible and broader assignments.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Christ contributed very substantially to the conception and establishment of EARWORT, the program under which TSD procures and supplies audio equipment for field use. He is learning how to convert the intense enthusiasm which he has at the start of a project to the steady continuous push required to carry the work through to completion.

## NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, il appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining futwe personnel actions.

Mr. Christ is an excellent Chief of our Audio Support Division. He is a leader of men, is loyal to his superiors, and is technically professional in his work.

Mr. Christ has one short coming, which is not of his own making--he lacks field experience--only because his superiors have felt his services were more needed at Headquarters. It is some times hard for him to understand the operational aspects of things as outlined by his assistants. To his credit it must be said he realizes this lack of field experience and uses the advice of his men to best advantage.

As soon as feasable he should be assigned to a responsible position at one of our overseas bases.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blanks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "I" on the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

THROUGH: Deputy Director for Science and Technology

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Quality Step Increase -
David L. Christ

1. It is recommended that Mr. David L. Christ, Chief of the Applied Physics Division, Office of Research and Development, be granted a Quality Step Increase from CS-16, step 6, to GS-16, step 7.

2. Mr. Christ entered on duty with the Agency on 16 November 1950. He transferred to ORD from the DD/P as a GS-16 in September, 1963. During the past four and one-half years he has assumed increasing responsibilities and has expertly implemented and fulfilled the objectives for which his Division was formed in the early growth period of the Office. Although he has performed equally as well, and perhaps better than, many of his equivalent Division chiefs within the Office, the supergrade T.O. limitation within the Office has prevented a raise other than the Legislative pay raises.

3. Mr. Christ is considered to be a key individual in ORD. His energy, initiative, and enthusiasm in developing concepts and applying managerial talents make his services to this Office invaluable. In particular, his development of audio surveillance, micropower-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

microtechnology, audio countermeasures, and emanations intelligence areas of effort within his Division make this Quality Step Increase long overdue, in my opinion.

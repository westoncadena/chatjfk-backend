ORD-8271-70
10 December 1970

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/PSD/OS

ATTENTION : Mr. Joseph Hossick

SUBJECT : CHRIST, David Lamar #43872

1.  During the last week in November 1970, Mr. David L. Christ,
    Chief of the Applied Physics Division, Office of Research and
    Development retired from the Agency. He is currently employed by
    Devenco of New York City.

2. ORD has a contractual relationship with Devenco and it is
   desired that the TOP SECRET clearance of Mr. Christ be activated so
   that he may be involved in this Agency-sponsored work.

3. While he was in ORD, the subject held several special
   clearances and it has been learned that he will require SI & TK in
   his present status as a contractor's employee. When his TOP SECRET
   clearance has been activated, we will file a separate request to
   cover the special clearances.

4. It is therefore requested that the subject be processed for
   an Industrial Security Approval at the TOP SECRET level. If any
   further information is needed, please contact the undersigned on
   extension 3233.

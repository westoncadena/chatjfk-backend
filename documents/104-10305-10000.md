Crime Division, is not now nor
has he ever been an employee
or employed in any capacity *with* the CIA. The undersigned added

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel

Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13 August 1981. Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone number. When the call was answered with the Houston number, Novel indicated that he was calling the New Orleans office. He was told that Farris was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to Houston. Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency file under the Freedom of Information Act. He was told that he should address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request. He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make sense of it. He did, however, discover that it contained information that was erroneous and he asked how to go about refuting the misinformation and/or correcting the file. It was suggested that he write a letter detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made. He did not seem interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of questioning. He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of the Agency directly. He was told that he should use the local representative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the Director. Novel indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified representative of the Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a small sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about that," then hung up.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

FROM : Raymond M. Reardon

SUBJECT : Pending Litigation - Gordon Novel

1. Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure who first came to the attention of this Agency during the Garrision Investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy. From time to time he has claimed to be a CIA employee or to be acting on behalf of the CIA. He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits to Domestic Collection Division offices. He has been in several scrapes with the law, most recently in October 1976 when he was on trial for conspiracy piracy to firebomb several buildings in New Orleans. Mr. Novel has now filed a civil suit claiming alleged violations of his rights and interference with his personal affairs. He is not suing the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard Osborn as a defendant. Mr. Osborn has been in touch with the Office of General Counsel seeking representation by the Justice Department since he feels his being named in the suit probably resulted from his official duties with the Agency.

2. On 27 April 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to inquire whether we had a file on Novel and if the file showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit. Mr. Jameson was given a rundown on the nature of the information in Novel's file and was also provided with Mr. Osborn's retirement date, 26 February 1974. Mr. Jameson mentioned that most of the alleged activities complained about by

CL BY 007472

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

CONFIDENTIAL

Novel occurred in 1975 and there is no apparent reason for Novel having singled out Mr. Osborn as a defendant. Mr. Jameson also requested traces on two individuals who are alleged to have been involved in this matter--Larry Blanscett and Bridget Pfiffer. He was advised that the Office of Security had no record of either of these individuals.

3. Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably be receiving a formal request for pertinent information as this case develops, but he merely needed a preliminary reading in order to determine if Mr. Osborn should be defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation. Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the undersigned.

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

ATTENTION : Mr. John K. Greaney

FROM : Edwal Jones
Deputy Director of Security
Personnel Security and Investigations

SUBJECT : Gordon Dwane Novel; Lawrence B. Rohde;
Allen D. Bell, Jr.

1. Reference is made to your 20 October 1976 priority request (OGC 76-5787) which asks that the Office of Security search its indices to determine if any of the above-named individuals have ever been employed by the Agency. Reference is further made to our telephonic response to you on 20 October 1976 confirming that none of these individuals have ever been employed by the Agency.

2. This memorandum will serve to confirm the referenced telephonic response. Office of Security indices contain no record in the name of Lawrence B. Rohde, which was also searched in the variation of Lawrence B. Rhode. The Office of Security does maintain files on Gordon Dwane Novel and Allen D. Bell, Jr. and a brief summary of the information contained within these files appears below:

a. Gordon Dwane Novel, SF#526 113

Mr. Novel has a long history of leaving the impression that he is either employed by or associated with the CIA. Mr. Novel has not, however, ever been an employee of the Agency in any capacity. The Office of Security file on Mr. Novel was established in 1967 by virtue of his involvement with the Garrison investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy. During the ensuing period Mr. Novel has both telephoned and written to the

# CONFIDENTIAL

Agency with various proposals, none of which have been followed-up by the Agency. Most recently, Mr. Novel was in contact with the Domestic Collection Division (DCD) in New Orleans, Louisiana, in October 1975 and February 1976 to volunteer various proposals. Mr. Novel's proposals were rejected by DCD, and Mr. Novel was requested to refrain fron future contact with that office,

b. Allen D. Bell, Jr., SP#648 216

Mr. Bell is President of Dektor Counter- intelligence and Security, Incorporated, Springfield, Virginia, and has appeared widely in the news media as a "wiretapping expert," most recently in connection with the Watergate hearings. Mr. Bell has never been employed by the Agency. The Office of Security file on Mr. Bell was established in 1970 based on a request from the Technical Security Division, Directorate of Operations (TSD) for a Contact Security Approval. Cited approval was granted in November 1971, although Mr. Bell's file does not reflect the specific purpose for the request nor if Mr. Bell was actually contacted. Mr. Bell was also of interest to DCD in October 1973; however, the specific purpose of this interest is not contained within Mr. Bell's file.

3. As indicated, a review of our records failed to disclose any indication that Mr. Novel, Mr. Rohde, or Mr. Bell have ever been employed by the Agency in any capacity.

# Novel Admitted Bunker Theft, Rhodes Is Told

Continued from Page 1

New Orleans to Houma at night in a Lincoln automo-bile owned and driven by Gordon Novel, and in a panel truck.

"AFTER ARRIVING at the site of the bunker, which was leased by Schlumberger Well Services Corp., the defendant, Gordon Novel, Sergio Arcacha Smith, David W. Ferrie, and others, unnamed, unlawfully entered it by cutting the lock with a pair of bolt cutters which had been brought along for the purpose."

"After entry into the bunker (they) took various forms of explosives and munitions. Thereafter they returned to the city of New Orleans with the stolen munitions."

# Novel Admitted Bunker Theft, Rhodes Is Told

An affidavit filed with new extradition papers sent to Columbus, Ohio, claims that Gordon Novel admitted his part in a burglary of a munitions bunker in Houma in 1961. The new extradition papers were sent to Ohio Gov. James Rhodes as part of Orleans Parish Dist. Attorney Jim Garrison's efforts to bring Novel back to Louisiana on a burglary conspiracy charge. Garrison wants Novel in connection with his investigation of President Kennedy's assassination.

James Alcock, an assistant district attorney, said in the affidavit:

"The said Gordon Novel responded to questioning by Jim Garrison, district attorney for the Parish of Orleans, and William Gurvich, investigative aide to Jim Garrison, that he and the parties, named here-in did in fact commit the conspiracy and burglary outlined above."

"In the body of the affidavit, Alcock declared that Novel, Sergio Arcacha Smith, David W. Ferrie and other unnamed persons 'did conspire, agree, and combine to burglarize a munitions bunker located in Houma, La.'"

He said the conspiracy was entered into in New Orleans at the home of Arcacha.

Alcock said that the men went to Houma on or about Aug. 21, 1961.

"The trip was made from (Turn to Page 4, Column 5)

The extradition papers also included a photograph of Novel identified by a former girl friend, Marlene Manci, 50, 42 Oaklawn dr., Metairie, who had dated Novel in 1961.

THE DOCUMENTS also contain a copy of the simple burglary charge leveled against Novel and Arcacha by the sheriff of Terrebonne Parish. The affidavit was signed by Capt. Bert Boyne.

Meanwhile, the DA's office said a new figure in the investigation scheduled for questioning today was interviewed last night by a Garrison aide.

A DA's office spokesman declined to say what questions were asked or what information was obtained from the man.

He is Juan M. Valdes, a self-described Latin playwright who figured in one of the city's more sensational murders. A subpena was issued for him yesterday.

Valdes in the summer of 1964 discovered the mutilated body of Dr. Mary Stults Sherman, a women physician who occupied the same St. Charles ave. apartment building where the summoned witness lives.

HE WAS investigating smoke coming from the Sherman apartment when he stumbled onto the body. Dr. Sherman's killer, who has never been found, tried to burn the body.

Garrison would not comment on what questions will be asked Valdes.

Another Latin, 30-year-old Carlos Quiroga, spent two hours and ten minutes before the grand jury yesterday and emerged without comment.

QUIROGA, a Cuban exile, was once a close friend and associate of a fugitive witness from the Garrison inquiry, 44-year-old, Sergio Arcacha Smith.

# Shaw Trial Attorneys Ordered to Keep Quiet

NEW ORLEANS (AP)- Criminal District Court Judge Edward Haggerty Jr. today ordered the prosecution and defense in the Clay L. Shaw's Kennedy assassination conspiracy trial to refrain from pre-trial publicity. He told them to quit discussing evidence.

The Judge said at a news conference he would invoke the canons of professional ethics "to prevent the flow of prejudicial pre-trial publicity" from either Shaw's attorneys or from Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's staff.

He said the arraignment of Shaw, indicted by the grand jury March 17 on charges of conspiring to assassinate President John F. Kennedy, probably will be held next week.

Haggerty said the same security measures in effect at Shaw's preliminary hearing earlier this month would be used at the arraignment. Reporters needed special credentials to cover the hearing and cameras were barred.

(Meanwhile, Gordon Novel issued a telephone challenge to Garrison today to prove by lie detector that the probe is not a fraud, United Press International reported.

(Novel, who left New Orleans shortly before the grand jury was to subpoena him last week, would not say where he was calling from. Novel reportedly took a lie detector test in McLean, Va., over the weekend, to back up his charges that the investigation is a fraud.).

Haggerty has said he does not believe the Warren Commission report on the assassination can be admitted as evidence mainly because the commission's witnesses could not be cross-examined,

Kroman had called a news conference for 7 p.m. today when he said he would tell of his private investigation into the assassination of Kennedy. It was not known what Kroman intended to say. A state highway patrolman found Kroman in his locked car at 4 a.m. 24 miles east of Bismarck. Kroman was paralyzed and incoherent, the policeman said. A loaded shotgun was across the attorney's knees.

Kroman was taken to a Bismarck hospital, where a doctor said Kroman apparently had suffered an epileptic seizure.

# Garrison Seeking Two As Arms Theft Plotters

NEW ORLEANS, La. (AP) - Garrison has alleged that Ferrie, Lee Harvey Oswald and Clay L. Shaw plotted in mid-September 1963 to kill President Kennedy. Oswald and Ferrie area dead. Shaw, 4, a retired New Orleans executive, has been indicted on a charge of conspiring to kill the president.

Garrison telegraphed arrest warrants yesterday to Montreal for Gordon Novel and to Dallas, Tex, for Sergio Arcacha Smith, based on charges of conspiring to burglarize a munitions bunker in 1961.

The warrants for Novel and Arcacha were signed by Criminal Dist. Court Judge Thomas Brahney, who set bond at $5,000 for each. Novel already had a $50,000 bond awaiting him on the warrant for his arrest as a material witness.

Garrison obtained a warrant for Novel's arrest last week as a material witness in the probe of President John F. Kennedy's assassination.

Arcacha, head of the anti-Castro Cuban Revolutionary Council in New Orleans in 1961, said in Dallas he does not know whether he will fight extradition to New Orleans. But he added, "It is a shame that in this country they do this to honest people."

The new charge accused Novel and Arcacha of conspiring with David W. Ferrie to commit simple burglary of a munitions dump in Houma, about 40 miles southwest of New Orleans.

The Shaw case is scheduled for arraignment Wednesday...

## New Orleans Probe Figure In D.C. Area

By United Press International

Gordon Novel, the "missing witness" in New Orleans Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's investigation of an alleged Kennedy assassination conspiracy, popped up in a Washington suburb yesterday and took a lie detector test on his charge that the Garrison investigation was a "fraud."

The operator of the polygraph test, Lloyd Furr of McLean, Va., said Novel "passed" the lie test. "He showed no deceptions," Furr said.

"Do you honestly believe Garrison's conspiracy prosecution is a fraud," Furr said he asked Novel. "Yes," he said Novel replied.

Novel, a former nightclub operator, left New Orleans shortly before a grand jury investigating the assassination tried to subpoena him.

In New Orleans, Judge Matthew Braniff has issued orders for Novel to post a $50,000 bond as a material witness or be arrested as a fugitive.

Novel's connection with the Garrison investigation has never been precisely spelled out.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
Director of Personel

FROM : John K. Greaney
Associate General Counsel

SUBJECT : Gordon Dwane Novel

1.  Gordon Novel is scheduled for prosecution in New Orleans on 27 October on charges stemming from a conspiracy to firebomb some buildings on Canal Street. He was mentioned extensively in the James Garrison investigation of the Kennnedy assassination in 1967. Subsequently, Novel filed suit against Garrison and later against *Playboy* Magazine for an article they published which identified Novel as a CIA employee. In 1969 the Agency submitted a certificate signed by the then Director of Personnel, Robert S. Wattles, which certified that Gordon Novel had never been employed by the CIA (copy attached). It may be necessary to submit a new certificate for the upcoming trial in New Orleans. You are requested to search your files to determine whether there is any record of employment.

2.  There are two additional defense witnesses that we would appreciate a search as to any employment relationship:

(a) Lawrence B. Rohde
530 "N" Street, S.W.
Washington, D.C.

It is my understanding that these names have all been traced as a request from the Domestic Collection Division with negative results. However, I would appreciate a written response to those traces by close of business 20 October so that certificates can be prepared.

3. It is possible that a witness from the Office of Personnel may be required to appear in New Orleans as a rebuttal witness to testify that there was no employment relationship with Gordon Dwane Novel, but this is subject to negotiation with the prosecutor.

Memo for Mr. Ray:

In Channel 6's news broadcast at 6-6:30 PM, Saturday, 25 March 1967, the local newscaster announced that NBC had located Gordon Novel and had interviewed him in "Washington." The film then switched to a front view of Novel sected in an armchair and showing him answering questions posed by someone off camera. (a) The latter asked if Garrison had promised Novel anything in exchange for his testimony. Novel said that Garrison had asked him if he needed money and had volunteered to give him whatever financial assistance he needed. (b) The interviewer asked what was Garrison's motive in prosecuting the case. Novel eventually said that it was purely political. But before that, he said that Garrison reminded him of Huey Long and of Dr. Goebbels, from what he had read. The interviewer asked this question a second time, couching it in somewhat different terms - what did Garrison hope to accomplish, what was his motive. Novel said that that was a matter of conjunction (conjecture), that he might bring in CIA.

At the conclusion of the Washington interview, the film returned to the local newscaster. The latter stated that NBC had informed the NO station that Novel had submitted to a polygraph test in connection with the interview and "had passed it."

The attached clippings from the 26 and 27 March issues of the Times-Picayune do not mention the substance of the NBC interview. These articles refer to NBC's having contacted Novel in McLean, Virginia, rather than Washington, D.C.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM: George N. Swann
Operations Support Branch/OS

SUBJECT: Gordon NOVEL
SFN 526113

1. On 31 August 1976, Major Robert Foster, Defense
   Intelligence Agency (telephone 11-50418), contacted
   Mr. Robert Hopkins, Office of Security Liaison Officer,
   seeking information concerning Subject. He explained that
   the Subject, while residing in a local motel, had overheard in
   a telephone conversation with a girl. They discussed large
   amounts of money with the indication it was illegally obtained.
   Also, in this discussion, Subject mentioned that due to this
   girl's information, he was arrested by the CIA in February 1976.

2. On 1 September 1976, Major Foster was contacted by
   the undersigned and advised that the CIA had knowledge of the
   Subject, but that he had never in any way been connected
   with the CIA nor had we ever arrested him. Major Foster
   was informed that the Subject has a long history of imper-
   sonating CIA agents or abusing the CIA's name during his
   activities. It was explained that based on our information,
   Subject appeared to be somewhat irrational.

3. Major Foster advised that he also felt the Subject
   was a "nut" and appreciated the information offered by the CIA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Operations Support Branch

SUBJECT : Gordon Novel
#526 113

REFERENCES : Domestic Collections Division Memoranda
dated 25 February 1976 & 1 March 1976

1. According to the referenced Domestic Collections Division (DCD) memoranda, the New Orleans DCD Office had con- sidered proposals from Subject in October 1975 and on 9 February 1976 which were rejected. During the last contact, the DCD representative requested Subject not contact him again.

2. DCD requested Office of General Counsel (OGC) guidance if they should be contacted by the press concerning Subject's arrest for conspiring to detonate incendiary devices in a down- town New Orleans building. OGC recommended that they acknowledge receiving a proposal from Novel which had been rejected. DCD was also informed that Subject had never been employed by the Agency, with the understanding that this might also be made known to any inquiring reporters or United States Attorney. DCD stated that they were pleased with this guidance, since it allowed them to respond candidly to any immediate inquiries and also serves to disassociate the Agency from the difficulties in which Subject now finds himself. It appears that the only action taken in this case is the OGC guidance supplied to DCD and the only CIA interest in Subject is based on his contact with the New Orleans DCD Office..

Subject has had no association w/ CIA,
but has been of past peripheral interest to DCD in
light of his notoriety in the Garrison case. No
action necessary in OSB!

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

**SUBJECT:** Gordon Novel's Arrest on Bomb Conspiracy Charges/Claim of CIA Association

**REF** : (a) NO-39-76 dated 20 February 1976, Subject: Gordon Novel

(b) Houck Watts Telecon of 24 February 1976, Same Subject

3

1.  The US Attorney in New Orleans, Gerald Gallinghouse, called the New Orleans Resident Office on 24 February 1976 to advise me that Gordon M. D. Novel had been arrested by agents of the US Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau (ATF) for conspiring to detonate incendiary devices in a downtown New Orleans building on Mardi Gras, 2 March 1976. Novel had apparently described such a plot in a conversation he unwittingly held with an undercover ATF agent.

2.  I confirmed to Gallinghouse that I had had a number of contacts with Novel since October 1975 concerning a proposal which Novel had offered for CIA consideration. I told Gallinghouse that the proposal had been rejected by the Agency, but that I had again seen Novel on 9 February 1976 to accept additional material in support of his proposal. At that time, I also asked Novel not to contact me again. I assured Gallinghouse that at no time had Novel been an Agency employee, nor had he ever had any formal relationship with the Agency. Gallinghouse thanked me for explaining the nature of our relationship with Novel, and he suggested that he might recontact me later if necessary for more details.

3.  In the referent telecon, I briefed the Deputy Chief of Operations, Ed Watts, on the development and asked him how I should respond if Gallinghouse sought access to the office file on Novel. Mr. Watts recommended that I try to avoid giving the US Attorney direct access to the file, but that if Gallinghouse should ask to review the file, I should refer the request to Headquarters for resolution.

4.  Mrs. Gordon Novel called shortly after my conversation with Messrs. Callinghouse and Watts. She said that her husband had asked her to call me to insure that federal authorities were aware that her husband had been actively discussing a proposal for the Agency with me. Mrs. Novel said that her husband had been denied boud, and that he hoped his contacts with a DCD officer might somehow convince federal authorities that he could be safely released on bond after all. Otherwise, she said, he might be detained through the Mardi Gras holiday as a precaution. She assured me that Novel had made no effort to persuade the authorities that he is a CIA officer or employee.

NO-43-76

1 March 1976

1. Attached are copies of two local news items concerning the recent arrest of Gordon Novel for the illegal possession of an explosive device and for conspiracy to bomb several buildings in downtown New Orleans. In the article dated 1 March and in recent television news coverage of the affair, Novel has been quoted as saying that he is involved in an important US Government intelligence project and is in frequent contact with on official of the Defense Department. As we reported in the referent memo, Novel told the US Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau (ATF) agents who arrested him that he was working on a CIA project, a claim he said they could verify by calling the New Orleans Resident Officer.

2. So far, there have been no public statements linking Novel's recent activities to the Agency. In the referent telecons, however, we requested guidance in responding to any media inquiries which might materialize. John Greaney, Office of General Counsel, recommended that we acknowledge, if asked, that Novel had offered the Agency a proposal which had subsequently been rejected. Mr. Greaney also confirmed that Novel has never been employed by the Agency, a fact which we might also make known to any inquiring reporters or to the US Attorney, if necessary. We are pleased with this guidance, since it allows us to respond candidly to any media inquiries, and it also serves to disassociate the Agency from the difficulties in which Novel now finds himself.

3. We will keep you informed of any further developments in this matter which relate to the Agency or to our contacts with Novel.

# Novel claims Defense tie

Businessman Gordon Novel, accused of plotting to firebomb downtown buildings during Carnival, claims he is involved in an enormous project" with "a gentleman in the Defense Department."

Asked if the enormous project" was linked to his arrest, Novel said, "Well, something is behind this. I think I know what it is but I would rather not say."

Novel, identified as a financial con- sultant with the Langford Land Co. here whose name surfaced nine years ago in former Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's Kennedy assassination probes, made his comments during a weekend jailhouse interview.

Novel was arrested Feb. 21 and charged with possessing a destructive device. He has been held without bond since then, pending a hearing Wednesday.

Affidavits filed in federal court allege that Novel tried to hire an undercover federal agent to firebomb five buildings during Mardi Gras, when large crowds would hamper fremen. Novel called the charge "insane".

"It's so insane that the government realizes the only way that it can make a case is to allege that I'm insane," he said. Novel said he was willing to take a lie detector test and to submit to ques- tioning under truth serum.

He said he has been "deeply involved" in "counter-intelligence" operations in the past, but did not elaborate.

"I know enough about the intelligence community to one day play a major po- litical role in it," Novel said.

IN 1963, Garrison accused Novel of conspiring with a Cuban refugee to steal explosives from an oil company storage site. Garrison's investigation linked Lee Harvey Oswald, the President's accused assassin, with a vaguely defined Cuban liberation movement.

Novel sued Garrison for $50 million, claiming his reputation had been dam- aged but the suit was later dropped.

Asked if the current charges bore any relation to the assassination probe, Novel's lawyer, Servando C. Garcia III, said: "It's a mistake. It's not related to anything."

"We absolutely plan to plead him inno- cent and put on a defense," Garcia sald. "The facts the U.S. Attorney has can be explained."

Prosecutors allege that Novel tried to hire undercover agent W. Lloyd Grafton to firebomb several downtown buildings at the height of Tuesday's Mardi Gras celebration, when fire trucks would be hampered by crowds.

AGENTS REPORTED seizing a can of alcohol, balloons, gunpowder, fuses and matches from Novel's office on the 40th floor of a downtown building, along with diagrams of the buildings involved.

"That's absolutely untrue," Novel said in the television interview. "They found nothing when they searched my office."

Documents filed in federal court indi- cated Novel, a real estate financial con- sultant, was "having a few problems" with some of the downtown property which was supposedly the intended tar- get of the firebombing.

Garcia said he hoped to have his client released on bond at Wednesday's hear- ing. He said there was no reason to keep Novel in jail indefinitely.

# Gordon Novel Seized

By ED ANDERSON

New Orleans businessman Gordon Novel remained in federal custody Friday on charges of possessing "a destructive device" in connection with an alleged plot to firebomb and destroy in succession "several" buildings in the Central Business District during the height of Carnival festivities.

Documents in federal court here reveal that Novel - identified as a financial consultant with the Langford Land Co. - was having "a few problems with some of the property located within the (downtown) project area."

Although no formal motive for the alleged planned bombings was given, sources said that Novel was trying to obtain the properties.

The only building cited by the court documents as a target for the alleged attacks was the Federation of Churches Building, located at 330 St. Charles Ave..

The sources said the bombs were never planted in the five downtown buildings and Novel - a figure in ex-Orleans Parish Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's investigation into the assassination of the late President Kennedy, - was arrested Feb. 21.

He is now being held without bond as a federal inmate at the New Orleans Police Department's House of Detention.

The court papers also indicate Novel tried to hire undercover agent W. Lloyd Grafton of the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) as the person to carry out the plan.

Sources said the plan was "to firebomb the buildings in sequence" during parade times "when the fire department equipment could not be brought into the Central Business District..." One source said the plan "was to put them (bombs) off in sequence ... one after the other,"

The dates and other locations of the four buildings allegedly targeted for the attacks were not given.

The documents, however, said the buildings were located in a three-block area of the One Shell Square Building or Poydras Street.

Novel's request for a bond hearing

was cor ed Friday by U.S. Magistrate Ingard O. Johannesen until 4 p.m. next Wednesday.

The complaint against Novel claims that when the defendant was arrested last week, he was in possession of "an incendiary device," consisting of a can of alcohol, balloons, a can of black powder, timed fuses and other equipment. Also confiscated, according to sources, were maps and diagrams of the buildings to be hit.

Novel was arrested after ATF agents learned the device was not registered. The court documents also claim that although Novel was unaware Grafton was an undercover federal agent, he tried to hire Grafton for the plan at $1,000 and a year's free rent in an apartment.

Reportedly, Novel and two other men were supposed to meet with Gov. Edwin Edwards last Saturday in Baton Rouge to discuss the possibilities of getting a world's fair for New Orleans.

"I had a luncheon scheduled (last) Saturday at the mansion with some people to talk about the exposition," the governor said. "But the name Novel doesn't ring a bell."

"Only one man showed up Saturday. He said the others couldn't make it and asked if we could re-schedule the meeting. I didn't even ask why they couldn't make it...."

An aide to the governor said the governor's office was trying to determine if one of the three men was Novel.

He said records of the appointment show only the time and subject matter of the meeting.

The aide added that Novel may have been one of the three, but he could not be certain.

According to the documents, the ATF Bureau received information "from a confidential informant" of the alleged plan.

Grafton, posing as a prospective "hit man," made arrangements to discuss the plans with Novel on Feb. 4.

The affidavit for a search warrant signed by Johannesen - said Grafton was told by Novel that Novel "had several buildings he wanted destroyed in the New Orleans, La. area...."

The papers also show that on Feb. 6, Grafton met Novel at Novel's home, 1718 Lakeshore Drive, where Novel allegedly said "he had made a firebomb for an individual to burn the first building he wanted destroyed, but that man failed to do the job."

The identity of that person was not revealed in the documents.

Novel said he "had a few problems with some of the property located within the (downtown) project area and that was where Grafton would come in...," according to the affidavit. The documents showed that Grafton met Novel again at his Plaza Tower office on Feb. 11 and the two "discussed the firebombing five buildings within the downtown area."

At that time, according to the documents, Novel allegedly showed Grafton the equipment as well as what Novel supposedly described as "illegal wire-tapping equipment."

At that meeting, the papers claim, Novel allegedly agreed to give Grafton "the contract" to destroy the five buildings.

That same day, the documents indicate, Novel supposedly pointed out the first building targeted for the alleged attack, and later took Grafton to "the building located between St. Charles and Camp Street."

According to the papers, Novel allegedly explained to Grafton "how difficult it would be to get inside the building."

At another meeting Feb. 13 between the two in Novel's office, the documents said, Novel drew a diagram of the first targeted building which was described as being "accross the street from One Shell Square."

Presumably, that building was the Greater Federation of Churches Building.

On that same date, the records allege, Novel told Grafton "the fire should be on the second floor in order for the roof and floor to burn completely."

It was then, according to the affidavit, that Grafton agreed to the plan for $1,000 and the free apartment.

According to the records, Novel also presented Grafton a notebook, containing "a plan project of approximately three blocks near the One Shell Square Building which was also to be part of the alleged scheme."

After their series of meetings Novel was arrested by the ATF agents Feb. 20. Novel was denied bail the next day and the government - led by Asst. U.S. Atty. Al Winters - was granted a motion that Novel be examined by a psychiatrist to determine his competency in the proceedings.

Defense attorney Servando C. "Sonny" Garcia III - a law partner of Municipal Court Judge Eddie Sapir, has urged that bond be set for his client..

In documents filed with the court Garcia called Novel "a man well respected in the community" who is "regularly employed as a financial consultant," and a family man.

FROM: Chief, Detroit Field Office
BY: Robert B. Noble, Cleveland Resident Office
DATE: 17 July 1975

SUBJECT: Correspondence of Possible Interest to Office of Security
REF: Durbin/Noble Telecon, 17 July 1975

CLV-121-75

1. On 15 July 1975, an agent of the Cleveland FBI contacted the Cleveland Resident Office concerning the attached correspondence. The Bureau had received the letters the same day, and because there were several references to the Agency, the agent thought that our office should be informed. Copies of the correspondence are attached for your information and retention.

2. The FBI agent who discussed this matter with us stated that he had been told that the author of the four-page letter was a "professional wiretapper", had previously been convicted to transporting illegal wiretap equipment across state lines (into Nevada), and was suspected of illegally obtaining and selling "classified information". Cleveland FBI plans no action at this time other than further in- vestigatory work on the individual.

3. The Cleveland RO plans to do absolutely nothing about this matter other than forwarding the information to Headquarters. The agent was informed of and agreed to this course of action, he was thanked for his concern and the matter was dropped.

Dear Mr. Doherty:

Enclosed is a Xerox copy of a letter received by special messenger on July 7, 1975, from Gordon Novel, making certain demands on Southwestern Bell, AT&T and companies serving Columbus, Ohio, Reno, Nevada and Washington, D. C. (See page 4, paragraph 3)

Mr. Novel's letter has been reviewed by our company Legal Department and a decision has been made not to reply in writing. Mr. Horak, the manager handling Novel's account, is to contact Novel and advise him verbally that his letter has been referred to higher management, and that copies of this letter have been forwarded to the telephone companies serving the cities he mentioned for any action they deem appropriate. Mr. Novel's propensity for filing suit was one of the main considerations for choosing this course of action.

Should any of the recipients of this letter decide to contact or write Novel I would appreciate being notified prior to your doing so. Our Legal Department wants to be kept abreast of any response made to his demands as it might affect the company's course of action.

Very truly yours,..

Original Signed. By
James. M. Vaughan, Jr.

Dallas, Texas 75202

Gentlemen:

Due to the rapidly accelerating national sensitivity of my historical personal interests, as well as the magnitude of political, intelligence and financial involvements for which I am legally responsible to my associates, I deem it wise to contact your office for the following reasons:

It is imperative that your files be revised in order to cease reflecting purposeful disinformation, slanderous irregularities and obvious inconsistencies about my activities. This data has been maliciously accumulated by your business and security offices during the past seven years while illegally intruding and interfering in highly sensitive industrial and political counterintelligence research in which I was involved. To accomplish this, A. T. & T. has used misrepresentation and a fraudulent legal technicality covering "anticipated" financial loss to the phone company. (My phone bills have always been paid promptly.)

The police tactics used by your offices--harrassment, intimidation, threats, extortionary demands--have been verified throughout Texas and in Washington, D. C. However, the highly sensitive nature of the work in which we are currently involved could, conceivably, pose a threat to national security because of this invasion of privacy where our phone calls are concerned.

My associates and I are currently involved with:

1) The House and Senate investigations of the federal intelligence community, i.e. domestic assassinations and Watergate Tape related matters;

2) Technical and political research and communication assistance for the National Wiretap Commission (Title-3 Oversight);

3) Communications and business matters related to CIA, concerning recent meetings I attended in Paris, France, with high-level Soviet Aerospace, Trade, and Communications officials;

4) A joint research study and military weapons marketing project for the Department of Defense;

5) A research study project for N.A.S.A. on an extremely advanced Top Secret Space Propulsion and Vehicular Design System;

6) Extensive pre-production research for a pro-CIA TV-film series in Hollywood;

7) Exclusive long-term research and development, including projected investment costs, in the Department of Transportations1 $20-billion T.F.C. network plans;

8) Research and mortgage-investment development In a $70-million office and hotel complex in downtown New Orleans, Louisiana;

9) Personal, legal and security responsibility for the imminent settlement of the $50-million litigation between Mesers. Howard Hughes and Noah Dietrich;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

Messrs. Horak, Vaughn and Wright

10) Current interest in the acquisition of a major D-FW region aerospace and manufacturing concern;

11) The distinct possibility that I will be selected by the President of the United States as the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

The foregoing projects, and our involvement with them, can be verified and will be verified if the activities of which I am complaining do not cease immediately.

Relative to the recent meeting in my private study at my Dallas residence, July 2, 1975, I have reviewed my records and do not find a willing nor direct acknowledgment of the R. B McMasters billing responsibility, alleged by Mr. Horak in his letter of the same date, written on plain watermarked stationery bearing questionable signature. That purportedly official telephone company document claims that I owe your company $1,041.42. I deny any responsibility for the reason that Mr. McMasters personally effected the installation of the phone at 3055 Leahy (243-6382), in his name and as an officer of the now-defunct Genesis Corpora- tion. I have caused approximately $20,000 to be paid to Mr. McMasters, privately and corporately, for his unsuccessful business ventures and I have no intention of assuming responsibility for something else I do not owe in Mr. McMasters behalf. He and the Genesis Corporation were personally and corporately responsible for the bills for that phone and I am certain your records will reflect same.

My records reflect that hundreds of vindictive, disparaging and slanderous long-distance telephone calls were placed by your company's collection operators alleging that I did owe the bill. These calls caused me and my associates severe personal and financial damages. I demand that the mistake be corrected in writing. I will furnish you the list of names and addresses.

Relative to the telephone number at 3170 Royal Lane, 214 358-2802, I acknowledge that G. N. Rose and Gordon Novel are one and the same person. I am certain that you have been aware of this for many months. My family and my attorney assure me that Gordon Novel is the legally incorrect one. Since I have lived 37 years as Gordon Novel, I do not wish to have it changed in court to suit some idiosyncrasy of your legal department.

The bills for this number are current and have been promptly paid, in cash, on time since it was installed last year. Your inconsistent--off again, on again--policy, and now escalating deposit demands, are probably negotiable, but only in accordance with the following terms:

Upon instructions from my attorneys, I am formally demanding that your office and A.T.&T. furnish written assurance, in affidavit form, that neither your Dallas office nor its Columbus, Ohio, Reno, Nevada, and Washington, D. C., counterparts has at any time within the past seven years surreptitiously intercepted or monitored by wire any aural conversation of Gordon Novel/G. N. Rose without the authorization of a Federal, State or Judicial Municipality Legal Court Order, in accord with the provisions of Title-Ilf of the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1968.

If such legal written assurance is not forthcoming from your office within seven (7) working days, we have instructed our Washington, D. C., attorneys to file appropriate federal civil actions personally against come individual security and and management officials and against Southwestern Bell and A.T.&T.

I further request that the outgoing call service at 214 358-280? be temporarily suspended, but that incoming

calls be allowed. to accumulate on the Dictaphone
Ansaphone and GTS coupling service you recently installed
and for which I was charged.

In the event you do not wish to honor your tariff
regulations and community service responsibilities,
available to other customers, you are then requested to
suspend, until further notice from either our attorneys
or from me, the paid-for service and notify all callers,
including A.T.&F. executives with whom I am currently
involved, that the party (1.e. Cordon Novel/G. N. Rose)
can be reached at 214 358-5353 or 522-1323. Any other
action will be answered by injunctive litigation.

These security measures are being taken at great
Inconvenience to a number of people. I am certain you
understand by now that I am very serious about the matters
discussed in this letter.

Sincerely,
![signature]

# Laser to Destroy Tapes Was Eyed

By Jack Anderson.

Former presidential aide Charles Colson once considered fitting a high-voltage Buck Rogers-style cannon at the White House to erase the taped conversations of Richard Nixon.

Such a mission impossible would liave wiped out the evidence on the White House tapes which led to Mr. Nixon's resignation. Colson, however, contends bo never seriously pondered putting the scheme into action.

Despite this denial, Colson ima meet twice with an industrial research consultant, Gordon Novel, and discussed tue possmuny of using an experimental "degaussing cannon" to fire a gigantic magnetic pulse at the White House tape storage room. A rough design of the ray gun, named after a magnetic measurement, was even drawn fup.

"Novel talked about driving by the White House and demagnetizing all the tapes," Colson told us from prison through friends. "It was something that he said would fire three blocks".

Novel, who is also an electronics expert, told us he was visiting Colson in March on an unrelated legal matter when the talk turned to the tapes.

Colson, he said, told him tapes at the White House and the CIA "could cause the President grief." Novel mentioned the "degaussing cannon" and Colson urged him to look into it. Colson insists he gave the con- sultant "no encouragement."

Novel, however, obviously thought he had a mandate from Colson. He journeyed to El Paso, Tex, and spoke with Jack Prentice, innovative research and design chief for Jetco, Inc. Jetco already was marketing a metal detector using "degaussing" principles.

Prentice told Novel, and confirmed to us, that he had built a prototype cannon and could construct an operational one for $25,000 to $30,000. Prentice believed that because the tapes belonged to the President, there wodid be nc crime in crasing them then if Colson, acting for the President, okayed it.

The Jetco specialist drew up a simple plan for the "dagaussing cannon," using capacitors, a switch, a parabolic reflector and a special heat resistant coil. The electronic artillery piece could be housed in a van, or raounted in a light piano or helicopter.

On March 21, Novel wrote Colson that he would "forward by hand courier the known facts on the El Paso erasure matter," the code name for the "degausser."

Shortly thereafter, the industrial consultant flew to Washington again and talked to one of this area's best known electronics men, Allan Bell, president of Dektor Counterintelli- Vence and Security. Bell threw cold water on the mission. cak-ing it "iffy" and "impcd."

Bell, the fake tane would be sont with a Lel-bizarre device would obliterate phosy authenticating note irem a few layers of tape, leavion the an allegedly disgruntled Seerst rest intach. At worst, it would dejaries man to the Secato

lstroy huge quantities of other taped material and scramble all computer "memories" in its path.

One part of the scheme was to bombard the CIA-and the irresistible jolt of magnetism might blot out priceless files of Russian and Chinese agents and other espionage and security matters.

In his report to Colson, Novel said hiding in the heavy woods near the CIA, or "degaussing" the tapes from the tank-van while they were in transport, offered a better chance of success manmatically homhamling from a plane.

But as Novel recalls it, he and Coison tautually decided not to pursue the plan because of its danger to national security tapes and computers near the target tapes.

Colson scoffs at the idea that the magnetic beam ever came that close to development. "I laughed at it," he said. "It was a little bit of comic relist" But (Mr. Nixon night have had fears Coison would be a sucker for just such farout ideas. In the transcripts, Nixon said Colson "loves the action . Colson would do anything."

Footnote: Colson and Novel jalso discussed a caper to patch R. Haldeman's voice onto a would imitate President Nixon and make false confessions. The

Watergate committee which, Colson surmised, would leak it. Then he and Novel would reveal the tape was fraudulent and the hoax would tend to discredit the whole case against Mr. Nizon. Colson said it was true he discussed this idea. "Wouldn't that be a great gag!" his statement said.

Baker's Bombshell-Bobby Baker, the former Senate aide who went to prison in a celebrated scandal of the early 1960s, kas completed more than half of a book that will embarrass some present senators.

Now a chocosful hreinass-man, Deker inusisto Lee' writing a cruel book about those who condemned him. Indeed, the book will contain many warm anecdotes about prominent political figures,

But the book will charge that Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), now the Senate's "Mr. Clean," twisted arms for political funds when he was the Republican Senate campaign chairman.

Baker will chide the present apostle of political reform, Gen. Sam Ervin (O-N.C.) for voting consistently against reform in times past

Eaker also will point out that Sen. Carl Curtis (R-Neh.), who saw no great wrong in Fresident Nixon's conduct, lashed out against the Democrais involved in the comparatively small-potatoes Baker case.

The former Senate boy wan-der bepes to publish his boukai ter the din of Watergate dies down.

Walter Sheridan - Democrats' investigator? or Republicans' Countermeasure?

Richard. E. Sprague.
Hartsdale, N.Y. 10530.

"The NBC broadcast of June 19, 1967" put on by Walter Sheridan "will probably stand for years as a symbol of the lengths to which some powerful outside interests will go in order to interfere with state government."

Walter Sheridan has recently been hired by the Democratic National Committee to head their investigation of the Watergate bugging caper. In view of the importance of this assignment, it would seem worthwhile to examine Mr. Sheridan's performance in past investigations.

"Getting" Hoffa, and False Testimony

Walter Sheridan first came into national prominence in 1961 when he spearheaded Robert Kennedy's drive against Jimmy Hoffa, during Robert's tenure as Attorney General. Sheridan pursued a relentless, no mercy shown, course of action to "get Hoffa", and get him he did. In the course of this crusade, some rather dubious techniques were used; which later

The Watergate Incident

On June 17 at 2:30 a.m., five men were arrested in the offices of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Hotel, Washington, D.C. They had broken into the office, and were found with electronic-surveillance devices, cameras for photographing documents, etc; they were wearing surgical rubber gloves. They were arrested by police.

These five men were James W. McCord, Jr., Bernard L. Barker, Frank Sturgis. Eugenio R. Martinez, and Virgilio R. Gonzales.

Their connections reach to the Republican Party, the Committee to Re-Elect the President, President Richard M. Nixon, the Central Intelligence Agency, and other persons and organizations.

Beginning in August 1972, "Computers and Automation" has been publishing articles on the Watergate Incident and its ramifications, because of the threat that this incident represents to democracy in the United States, and the importance of seeking the truth about it and pinning down the responsibility for it.

came back to haunt Mr. Sheridan. The prime example was the "uncovering" of a key witness against Hoffa, one Grady Partin of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Partin was some years later accused by a grand jury of giving false testimony against Hoffa.

"Getting" Garrison

Mr. Sheridan's most notable performance came in 1967 and '68 when he was an executive producer for NBC-TV news. Sheridan produced a one-hour NBC special on Jim Garrison's investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy and the trial of Clay Shaw for conspiracy to murder the President. The program, broadcast on June 19, 1967, was a highly biased, provably dishonest, personally vindictive, attack on Garrison defending Shaw. The Shaw trial did not take place until February, 1969, a year and a half later.

Arrest by Garrison and Indictment by Grand Jury

Walter Sheridan was arrested by Garrison on July 7, 1967, following the NBC Special, and indicted by a grand jury on two counts. The first was attempted bribery and intimidation of a witness. Rick Townley of station WDSU, the NBC affiliate in New Orleans, was arrested and indicted with Sheridan on the same charges. The federal government, especially the Justice Department, made sure that Garrison was never able to bring Sheridan and Townley to trial. The indictments are still open.

If the Sheridan trial ever does take place, the conviction should not be too difficult. Here are the facts, as reported by both New Orleans newspapers, the Times Picayune and the States Item, in 1967 and summarized in "The Kennedy Conspiracy" by Paris Flammonde, Meredith Press, 1969..

Sheridan and Townley, having been assigned by NBC to cover the Garrison-Shaw case, became personally and directly involved. The indictments for bribery, suppressing and altering evidence, and interfering with the trial, did not begin to tell the entire story. NBC top management, Frank McGee, the narrator of the special, and others at NBC, fully

backed up Sheridan, until ic of the lies, bribes and fakes in the program were revealed.

## Apology by NBC for Lies Told by Two 'Witnesses"

Frank McGee later had to apologize on NBC for lies told by two of Sheridan's "witnesses" on the special. Sheridan and Townley paid them to give statements against Garrison. The FCC ruled that NBC had to give Garrison equal time after Garrison made an appeal, because the special had not been a news program, but an NIC-Sheridan vendetta against Garrison. NBC did give Garrison 30 minutes (the special was one hour) to respond at a later date in 1967.

To illustrate Sheridan's and NBC's techniques in the case, at one point the President of NBC helped in the bribery efforts by calling Mr. Gherlock, head of Equitable Life Insurance Co. in New York. Gher- lock was asked for assurance that Perry Russo, who worked for Equitable in Louisiana, would cooperate with NBC on the Garrison special. Russo was the key witness in the Shaw trial whom Sheridan and Townley tried to bribe.

To remind the reader about the Shaw trial, Jim Garrison opened an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy in late 1966. Senator Long of Louisiana hod convinced Garrison that a conspiracy had existed. Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in New Orleans prior to the assassination, along with the strange actions of David Ferrie, on the day of the assassination, attracted Garrison's attention. He had not made his investigation public but a curious newspaper reporter named Rosemary James broke the story after a few months of effort. Clay Shaw's other identity, Clay Bertrand, had already been uncovered by Garrison, and his involvement in the planning for the assassination had already been suspected by early 1967.

## Party in David Ferrie's Apartment.

Perry Russo attended a party in David Ferrie's apartment where Clay Bertrand, Ferrie, someone resembling Lee Harvey Oswald and others had discussed the possibility of assassinating President Kennedy. He became the key witness when Garrison arrested Shaw on March 1, 1967, and a grand jury indicted Shaw on March 22 following two hearings on March 14 and March 17 by a three judge panel and a four judge panel, recommending that Shaw be held for trial.

## Effort to Have Russo Change His Testimony

Sheridan and Townley both made up their minds along with most of the news media and the Justice Department, that Garrison had to be stopped at all costs. They decided to really go to work on Perry Russo, since his testimony was all important.

Townley tried to get Russo to change his testimony at the Shaw trial to make it seem that Garrison had hypnotized him and had then asked him leading questions to get Russo to testify against Shaw. Townley and Sheridan went to Russo's house, his office, and met him at other places. They badgered him and attempted to bribe him. They pressured and threatened him. They used every trick in the book to try to get him to change his testimony.

They threatened him with being discredited, made to seem insane, and perhaps fired from his job. They offered him a chance to work closely, for high rewards, with NBC in Sheridan's all-out effort to get Garrison. Sheridan told Russo, "We're going to destroy Car on and his case along with him." Townley told Russo that he could get Shaw's lawyer, Dymond, to go casy on him at the trial, if he would alter his testimony. He told Russo that his employer had promised NBC that no retaliation would be taken against Russo if he cooperated with MC. However, he might be fired if he didn't cooperate.

Sheridan told Russo that NIC could set him up in California where Russo always wanted to live, if he helped bust up the Garrison probe. Sheridan said NBC would pay his expenses to California and to live there, would protect his job, would get Russo a lawyer, and would guarantee that Garrison would never extradite him back to Louisiana.

## Gordon Novel, Worker for the CIA

Another important witness in the Shaw trial was Gordon Novel, a bugging and electronics expert who worked for the CIA. Garrison tried to subpoena him, but he left New Orleans and fled to Ohio. Garrison was never able to extradite Novel from Ohio to Louisiana in spite of Novel's public statements that he knew who had killed David Ferrie. (Ferrie died mysteriously shortly after Garrison's probe became public knowledge.)

Walter Sheridan told Perry Russo that NBC had helped Novel escape Garrison's clutches by flying him out of Louisiana to NcLean, Virginia (home of the CIA). NBC paid for a lie detector test to be administered to Novel in McLean. The test was supposed to prove that Novel was telling the truth when he said he knew nothing about the Kennedy case. Sheridan told Russo that NBC would do the same thing for him that they had done for Novel, namely, make sure that Novel would never be extradited to Louisiana to testify. Since Novel never was extradited and since Governor Rhodes of Ohio blocked his extradition making Governor McKeithen of Louisiana extremely angry, it would seem that Sheridan was right NBC did possess a lot of clout.

Sheridan and Townley also went to work on Gordon Novel's former wife, Marlene Mancuso. She was another important Shaw trial witness, because of her knowledge about Novel's CIA activities and a burglary of a munitions dump in Houma, Louisiana. Townley called her and tried to convince her to grant a taped interview for use on the NBC show. He said Garrison was going to be destroyed and that she should cooperate with NBC.

## The NBC Special on June 19, 1967

The NBC-Walter Sheridan special on June 19, 1967, titled "The JFK Conspiracy - The Case of Jim Garrison", was packed with Sheridanese. Here are the principal examples:

1.  A lawyer named Dean Andrews in New Orleans had played a key role in the Shaw trial because Clay Bertrand had telephoned him in a hospital shortly after the assassination and asked him to represent Lee Harvey Oswald. Andrews told so many different stories about Clay Bertrand that the truth was difficult to determine.

Frank McGee asked Andrews on the program about Clay Bertrand and whether he was Clay Shaw. Andrews said Bertrand was actually Eugene C. Davis, a bar owner in New Orleans. Sheridan's coup quickly blew up in his face when Davis denied the whole thing. When the trial finally took place, Shaw was pegged as Bertrand by a woman who saw him sign his name as Clay Bertrand.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

# Bundy Lying

2. Sheridan's second attempt was to attack the credi-
   bility of Vernon Bundy, a witness for the prosecution
   who had seen Oswald and Shaw together on the New Or-
   Deaas lakerront (Lake Pontchartrain). Sheridan
   cooked up two "witnesses" against Bandy. NBC pre-
   sented John "the Baptist" Cancler, a burglar and
   Miguel Torres, also a burglar, who had been ac-
   quainted with Bundy.

Sheridan paid Cancler and Torres to make state-
ments on the program. Cancler said that Bundy had
indicated to him that his story regarding Oswald
and Shaw was not true. Torres asserted that Bundy's
testimony was "an out-front lie". Cancler said he
had been approached by members of Garrison's staff
to plant" something in Shaw's house. Torres claimed
that the had been asked (by Garrison) to testify that
Shaw had made homosexual advances toward him and
also that Shaw was Bertrand.

Frank McGee reported that NBC had discovered
Bundy was lying during his polygraph test and Gar-
rison knew it but let him testify anyway.

## Cancler Sentenced to 18 Years

Following the TV show, Cancler was called before...
the Orleans Parish grand jury and asked to repeat
his accusations under oath. Cancler took the fifth
amendment, refusing to reiterate his TV charges. The
jury foreman immediately took Cancler before a judge.
and asked him to repeat. Cancler again took the
fifth and was found guilty of contempt of court and
fined $500 or one year. Apparently Sheridan had
paid him a lot more than $500. Two weeks later
Cancler was handed a third convinction and sentenced
to eighteen years as a multiple offender.

Miguel Torres was also brought before a grand
jury and took the fifth when he was asked, "Were
the statements you made on national television on
NBC in June 1967, concerning the district attorney,
true?"

James Alcock, Garrison's assistant district at-
torney who handled the Shaw trial, said to the judge,
"Torres and Cancler just tell the television and
Walter Sheridan about it. When they have an oppor-
tunity to do something they take the fifth amendment."

## Sheridan Could Not Get Russo to "Cooperate"

3. Sheridan himself appeared on screen to discuss
   Perry Russo. He could never get Russo to change
   his mind and cooperate, so Sheridan interpreted for
   the audience what Russo had told him. He stated
   that Russo told him that his testimony against Shaw
   may be a combination of truth, fantasy and lies.

Andrew Sciambra, Garrison's assistant district
attorney who interviewed Russo, delivered a memo to
Garrison, detailing Walter Sheridan's efforts to
bribe and threaten Russo. The statements made by
Russo to Sciambra were very incriminating about
Sheridan. The net result of all Sheridan's efforts
were that Russo stuck to his story at the trial.

## Fred Leemans, "Witness"

4. Sheridan's last "witness" on the show was Fred
   Leemans, another bar owner (Sheridan seemed to
   specialize in bar owners) and former Turkish bath
   operator. Leemans said that his original statements
   given to Garrison about Clay Shaw were not true and
   that his psyche began to trouble him. The morality
   of his actions wegan to weigh upon his mind. Perhaps
   a little of Sheridan's green stuff weighed even more
   heavily. At any rate he recanted his claim that Clay.
   Shaw had come to the Turkish hath, that he (Leemans).
   had associated the name Bertrand with Shaw, and that
   on occasion he had been accompanied by a young
   slightly-bearded man whom he called "Lee". Leemaกร
   said on TV that Garrison had offered him $2500 for
   his testimony.

The New York Times telephoned Leemans following
his appearance for an interview. He refused to
speak about his NBC hit, conceding that he had ar-
ranged to give the Associated Press the exclusive
story. He said, "After all, I have to get something
out of all of this." On hearing this line, one of
Garrison's staff smiled and said, "Ah, now that's
the Fred Leemans we all recognize."

## Bribing and Attempting to Bribe Witnesses

In addition to bribing and attempting to bribe
witnesses, Sheridan also had meetings with one of
Garrison's part-time investigators, William Gur-
vich. Garrison found out about the meetings and
did not give Gurvich all of the information he
wanted.

Jim Garrison said about Sheridan and the NBC
broadcast, "Aside from the fact that it insulted
the intelligence of every American, it was a very
clear attempt to prejudice in advance possible
jurors in the case. This program will probably
stand for years as a symbol of the lengths to
which some powerful outside interests will go in
order to interfere with state government."

## Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical

Computers and Automation, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-
puters and data processing, believes that the pro-
fession of information engineer includes not only
competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but also a broad responsibility
in a professional and engineering sense, for:

*   The reliability and social significance of pertinent input data;
*   The social value and truth of the output results.

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional responsibility for the reliability and
significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes
from time to time articles and other information
related to socially useful input and output of data
systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
but productive of thought and an improved and
safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which
our children and later generations may have a fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to
relate his engineering to the most important and
most serious problems in the world today: war,
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo-
sion, and many more.

CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM
RELEASE IN FULL 1998

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March 1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with a burglary of a munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left New Orleans, first going to McLean, Virginia where he was given a lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective. (See summary on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's proximity to McLean, Va.

After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967 a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-ITEM, Hoke MAY.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

# SECRET

Hoke MAY was granted a Covert Security Approval in April 1958 for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly employed by FJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his position with a private firm which handled work for the Project. The letter was presumably written to a "Mr. WEISS" in CIA and referred to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVEL claimed he was involved. This matter was reviewed by CI/R&A at the time the matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE-CHEK was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to the widows of American flyers who participated in the Bay of Pigs. No connection with NOVEL could be established. NOVEL knew Sergio ARCACHA-SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti-Castro organization. Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEL could have gained an impression from him that he was employed by CIA.

In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from arest by GARRISON on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned to Louisiana to testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana.

## DETAILS:

The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker. However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967, that Colonel BURBANK was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that BURBANK and NOVEL knew each other. BURBANK testified that every Louisiana sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

INCIDENT Request for Information TIME 2010 hours PLACE Galaway, Ohio
Re Gordon Novel

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

1. Mrs. Adams called the Agency to request employment verification of one Gordon Novel. Questioned as to her reason for the request, Mrs. Adams replied that Novel is a friend of her son, Frank Adams, Jr., age 27 and that she is looking out for her son. If Novel does in fact work for this Agency she intends to drop her investigation of him, but if he does not she will make every effort to end the friendship.

2. A cursory check of available records showed no listing for Novel and Mrs. Adams was advised accordingly. She then provided, at some length, a review of her efforts to check on Novel, including contact with the FBI and Ohio police. In her investigation she has been told to have nothing to do with Novel and to stay away from him. She has also learned that he was in some way connected with the "Garrison and Kennedy trial" through Mr. Jerry Winer, an attorney in the trial. From Novel's wife, Mrs. Adams was informed that Novel works for the CIA. Hence, her call to Washington tonight.

3. Mrs. Adams was again informed that Mr. Gordon Novel is not an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. The call was then termin- ated.

ACTION TAKEN:

4. Later checks of BR&CD records show that a file on Gordon Novel is maintained on a permanent basis by SRS. The file number is 332-959.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel
#526113

1. On 20 May 1969, the Director of Security advised that he had received a call from Mr. Bienvenu, Director of Security, National Security Agency, regarding a possible impersonation by Subject. According to Mr. Bienvenu, an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, Mr. Russen 1. Aufrance, 3256 South Union Avenue, Alliance, Ohio, 44601, had called Mr. Mathison and advised that a contact of his had stated that Subject had shown a CIA credential and indicated that he was employed by the Agency. Mr. Aufrance advised he called the National Security Agency to bring this matter to the attention of the highest security officials in Washington and that if anyone wished to contact him they should call him before 5:00 p.m., this date.

2. After reviewing Subject's file and confirming that Mr. Aufrance was an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, I briefed the Director of Security who requested that I call Mr. Aufrance and advise him that we were knowledgeable of Subject and that on other occasions he had inferred he was employed by CIA. In addition, that we intended to turn this information over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for investigation since the FBI had jurisdiction on such impersonation cases.

3. I later briefed Mr. Fred J. Cassidy, FBI/Liaison, who suggested that I advise Mr. Aufrance to report the information to local FBI agents. In Mr. Cassidy's presence, I called Mr. Aufrance who repeated what he had told Mr. Mathison. He also stated that Subject's wife is now separated from him and is suing him for divorce in Columbus, Ohio. She has stated that Subject is armed, carries a

tear gas weapon and some kind of a .22 caliber pistol, concealed as a fountain pen. She stated that Subject is leaving Columbus for Reno, Nevada, where he intends to open a gambling establishment. In further discussion with Mr. Aufrance, he indicated his source was a friend of Subject's wife and from other statements he made, it is believed that his source is Thomas F. Hughes, Jr., who was interviewed by the Chicago Field Office on 18 April 1969.

4. After further discussion with Mr. Aufrance during which he indicated he was leaving for a fishing trip in Canada and would not return until Sunday, 25 May 1969, it was agreed that he would contact the local Federal Bureau of Investigation and brief them regarding Subject and that I would, meanwhile, alert FBI Headquarters/Washington, which could follow-up with the local office.

5. I then provided Mr. Cassidy with all pertinent information regarding Mr. Aufrance's telephone call and all information on Subject. Mr. Cassidy will keep us advised.

INCIDENT Request for Information TIME 2010 hours PLACE Galaway, Ohio
Re Gordon Novel

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

1. Mrs. Adams called the Agency to request employment verification of one Gordon Novel. Questioned as to her reason for the request. Mrs. Adams replied that Novel is a friend of her son, Frank Adams, Jr. age 27 and that she is looking out for her son. If Novel does in fact work for this Agency she intends to drop her investigation of him, but if he does not she will make every effort to end the friendship.

2. A cursory check of available records showed no listing for Novel and Mrs. Adams was advised accordingly. She then provided, at some length, a review of her efforts to check on Novel, including contact with the FBI and Ohio police. In her investigation she has been told to have nothing to do with Novel and to stay away from him. She has also learned that he was in some way connected with the "Garrison and Kennedy trial" through Mr. Jerry Winer an attorney in the trial. From Novel's wife, Mrs. Adams was informed that Novel works for the CIA. Hence, her call to Washington tonight.

3. Mrs. Adams was again informed that Mr. Gordon Novel is not an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. The call was then termin- ated.

ACTION TAKEN:

4. Later checks of SR&CD records show that a file on Gordon Novel is maintained on a permanent basis by SRS. The file number is 332-959.

Chicago Field Office
18 April 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR; Headquarters

SUBJECT:
NOVEL, Gordon
(Impersonation of Agency Officer)

1. There is no case number. The case was generated by events that took place in the Chicago, Illinois area. No special requirement was levied by Headquarters; however, it was coordinated with Headquarters.

2. At approximately 4:15 p.m., 18 March 1969, Mr. Sam SIMPSON, Chief, Domestic Contacts Service (DCS) Field Office in Chicago, Illinois, contacted the Chicago Field Office and advised that Mr. Robert FAY, Special Agent with the Chicago FBI Office, had called the DCS Office with reference to some person by the name of "Mr. ROSE" (phonetic) who purportedly represented himself as a CIA representative in some telephonic contacts with the office of Mr. Tom HUGHES, President of M. F. Hughes Oil & Coal Company, in Chicago. The "Mr. ROSE" reportedly told Mr. HUGHES' office that he was with the CIA and that it was urgent that Mr. HUGHES come tonight to Room 551, Ambassador East Hotel, Chicago, on an important matter. (Subsequently, Mr, HUGHES was identified as Mr. Thomas F. HUGHES, Jr., born 1926 in Chicago; Owner and President of the above family firm; former Owner of the Playboy Club in New Orleans, Louisiana)

Agent FAY was contacted by the Chicago Field Office and he advised that nothing of value had been obtained by "Mr ROSE", therefore, the FBI had no grounds for an impersonation case and could not officially enter the case. Agent FAY said that he had instructed Mr. HUGHES to refuse the invitation to go to Room 551, Ambassador East Hotel, and that if "Mr. ROSE" called again, that Mr. HUGHES should contact Agent FAY. Agent FAY further advised the Chicago Field Office that he had verified through the front desk at the Ambassador East Hotel that a "Mr. ROSE" was a registered guest for Room 551 and that he was from the "St. Louis suburban area".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 84

3. At 2:00 p.m., the next day (19 March 1969), with the prior approval by and coordination with Headquarters (Mr. Tim HARRINGTON), Mr, Thomas F, HUGHES, Jr., previously mentioned, was interviewed under Agency cover at the Sage's East Restaurant, 181 East Lake Shore Drive, Chiango. The place of interview was designated by Mr. HUGHES, Sage's East is an expensive and popular eating establishment on Chicago's Gold Coast, a neighborhood of fashionable hotels, apartment houses, shops, entertainment establishments, etc.

4. Mr. HUGHES' demeanor around Sage's East indicated a great deal of familiarity with the premises and personnel. Obviously, he is a regular patron with special privileges. For instance, without permission, he walked into a closed off section of the restaurant and selected a table for the interview. He then beckoned a waiter to bring two cups of coffee.

5. Assistant Special Agent in Charge James E. MACKEY, Jr. conducted the interview with Mr. HUGHES.

6. Mr. HUGHES is about 43 years of age and about 5'8" in height, 155/160 pounds, dark blond (or even light brown) hair, which he wears short and combed straight down. He is neat and trim, walks with confidence and agility, and appears conscious of his appearance. He was dressed in a powder blue suit, white turtle neck shirt and dark loafers. He moved around and talked with a smooth, confident, self-assured manner. Based upon his physical appearance, dress, speech and personality, he could be described as a "swinger", "jet setter", "party guy", etc. His conversation touched stylish and action-oriented restaurants, night clubs, places of ontertainment, Playboy Clubs, etc. He was very cooperative and volunteered to assist in any manner

7. Mr. HUGHES said that he is President and Owner of the M.F. Hughes Oil and Coal Company, 3134 East 90th Street, Chicago, a business that dates back to his grandfather. He said that he took the business over several years ago, upon the death of his father, and built it into a successful, profitable operation. Most of his time is spent on outside sales work. He spends very little time in the office. He has a telephone in his auto and prefers to have his office screen the telephone calls before giving them to him to answer. The day-to-day internal operation of business is handled by his office staff. He believes he contributes more to his business.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 85

by working on the outside.

8. In addition to his coal company, Mr. HUGHES stated he has various other business interests in Chicago, Florida and other parts of the United States. He is a partner in a real estate venture in the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida area. Mr, HUGHES claims a part-ownership of the Maryland Hotel in Chicago.

9. Mr. HUGHES said that he is a personal friend of Mr. Hugh HEFNER, founder and operator of the Playboy Club chain. Mr. HUGHES said that for a few years in the early 1960's, he was the owner of the Playboy Club in New Orleans, Louisiana. He founded the New Orleans Playboy Club and later, disposed of it because it was unprofitable.

10. Mr. HUGHES said he has been estranged from his wife for several years. She has refused to give him a divorce. The wife lives in Chicago with the children of the marriage. Mr. HUGHES said he has an apartment in the Carriage House, Chicago.

11. Mr. HUGHES further said that he is "not perfect" and it is no secret that he has been involved with a lot of women over a period of years. Mr. HUGHES indicated that women seem to be attracted to him. He admitted being a "soft touch" for people in need.

12. Mr. HUGHES claimed contacts with a number of important people in politics, entertainment, business, sports and society. He said he is a personal friend of entertainer Frank SINATRA. Mr. HUGHES claimed that people are always calling on him for political and business favors. These people think he can get things done.

13. Mr. HUGHES said that between 3:00 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. on 18 March 1969, his office received telephone calls (four) from a "Mr. ROSE" on a "Mr. BARRON" calling for "Mr. ROSE", requesting that he come to Room 551, Ambassador East Hotel, for some urgent matter. On two of the calls, the caller identified himself as a CIA Representative. The above calls were taken by either his secretary (Marilyn) or his office manager (Mr. WARD).

14. After the last call, Mr. HUGHES said he tried to call Agent FAY at the FBI, but he was gone for the day. Mr. HUGHES then called Room 551, above hotel, and asked "Mr. ROSE" what the matter was all about? What was so urgent? Was he with the Central Intelligence Agency? Was he with the United States Government? Mr. HUGHES said "Mr. ROSE" avoided the point blank question of whether he was with the Central Intelligence Agency, "Mr. ROSE" parried the direct question with the remark, "I said CIA". Mr. HUGHES further related that "Mr. ROSE" wasn't going to admit he was representing the Central Intelligence Agency. Than Mr. HUGHES told "Mr. ROSE" that the whole matter was so


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 86

suspicious that he has turned it over to the FBI. The conversation was then concluded.

15. Shortly thereafter, according to Mr. HUGHES (also confirmed by Mr. FAY), a person who identified himself as Gordon NEVILLE, NEVEL OR NOVEL called the FBI Office and said he registered in Room 551 at the Ambassador East and that he was in Chicago on a matter involving James GARRISON and a legal action against Playboy Magazine for defamation of character or some such vague explanation. Agent FAY was recontacted by CFO regarding the above telephone call, but he was unable to add to, or clarify the details of the call. Agent FAY said he prepared a brief memorandum on the case and closed it.

16. Mr. HUGHES said he has suspected all along that the telephone calls were either made by, or instigated by one Gordon NEVIL, NEVILLE or NOVEL (HUGHES professed only phonetic spelling; however, Headquarters, after an indices check, later said that it was probably Gordon NOVEL, who had previously owned a bar in New Orleans and who had previously claimed an affiliation with the Agency).

17. Mr. HUGHES said that he has a little background on Gordon NOVEL and it may have a bearing on the recent events. Mr HUGHES said that about three years ago, he met one Abbey MULLIGAN a native of Tennessee, who was then working as a bunny in the Playboy Club in Chicago. Abbey has also worked at Playboy Clubs in New Orleans, Cincinnati, London and other places. A few years ago, Abbey married NOVEL, whom she met in New Orleans. Since that time, Abbey and NOVEL have made their home in the Columbus, Ohio area. They have had a lot of fights and arguments and have been separated on several occasions, Abbey has filed for a divorce. Presently, Abbey is living in Columbus with her parents, the John MULLIGANS

18. Mr. HUGHES further related that NOVEL lives by his wits and is not to be trusted; that NOVEL engages in "private oye" work of questionable practices; that he (NOVEL) reportedly taps telephones, "bugs" rooms and takes photographs, all of which are in connection with questionable activities; and that NOVEL, in the past, according to Abbey, has claimed working for the Agency.

19. Mr. HUGHES further related that he has no romantic interests, such as marriage, with Abbey and looks upon her as a good friend. Last summer, Mr. HUGHES arranged for Abbey to spend a few weeks in the Ft. Lauderdale area. Mr. HUGHES was there also. Mr. HUGHES said that he made elaborate procautions to make sure that Abbey couldn't be traced directly from Columbus to Florida. He had Abboy fly to Chicago and then catch another plane to Florida. Somehow, MI, HUGHES further related, NOVEL found out about their trip to Florida, according to Abbey.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 87

20. In conclusion, Mr. HUGHES said that NOVEL is a very, very shady character who is not to be trusted. Mr. HUGHES has never met NOVEL. Based upon what he knows about NOVEL, he believes NOVEL would engage in extortion, bribery, blackmail, etc.

# FOLLOWS DEVIOUS PATH

## Letter by Novel Adds to Mystery

A letter written by fugitive witness Gordon Novel added a new cloak and dagger twist today to the Kennedy assassination probe.

Attorney Steven Plotkin said Novel actually wrote the communication. Further, he said his client was working for the Central Intelligence Agency here in 1961.

But Novel called the letter a "trap" set for Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison, who is attempting to bring Novel back to New Orleans for questioning.

WHATEVER THE authenticity of the document, the circumstances of its discovery read like a chapter in a who-done-it.

The letter came into the hands of States-Item reporter Hoke May. This is how it happened:

The letter turned up when two girls were doing their spring housecleaning. It was well hidden in the fugitive witness's French Quarter apartment.

SO-WELL HIDDEN, in fact, that a team of Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents and officers from Garrison's investigative squad missed it when they searched the rooms after Novel left town in March.

The girls, who rented the Novel apartment after his departure, found it during a thorough housecleaning and refurnishing session.

One of them turned it over to her boyfriend. He, in turn, showed it to his professor at a New Orleans university.

The professor is a friend of May's.

THE LETTER was addressed to a Mr. Weiss and probably was "written in late January or early February of this year, judging by the time sequence. It describes:

When a copy was sent to him, Plotkin reviewed its contents, spoke to his client and told the States-Item Novel had drafted the letter.

He said, "Everything in the letter as far as Novel is concerned is actually the truth."

The contents of the missive are compounded of cryptic references, code names and a plea for Weiss to get Novel "out of this mess" by an unspecified date in March of 1967.

THE LETTER appears to be a draft which later might be recopied or typed. There is no indication it was ever mailed, however, and Plotkin said he does not know whether the draft was sent "to the addressee."

Presumably, Weiss is connected with the CIA.

Novel departed New Orleans about mid-March after receiving a subpena to testify in Garrison's Kennedy death plot investigation. He went to McLean, Va., the headquarters of the CIA.

HE WAS MET there by a former official of the Justice Department who now works for one of the radio-television networks.

The 29-year-old former bar owner took a lie detector test at McLean and ducked under cover for another few days, a time when he was reported to be in Montreal.

AN INDEPENDENT handwriting expert says the letter is in Novel's handwriting. The expert, Gilbert Fortier of New Orleans, compared the penciled letter with other samples of Novel's writing and printing.

"It is my conclusion that the same person who wrote the handwriting specimens also wrote the draft to Mr. Weiss," Fortier asserted.

He said he checked especially for the possibility the letter might be a forgery but concluded it was not probable.

"It was written too easily and too freely to have been forged," Fortier said.

THE LETTER to Weiss begins:

"This letter is to inform you that District (Attorney) Jim Garrison has subpenaed myself and an associate to testify before his Grand Jury on matters which may be classified TOP SECRET. Actions of individuals connected with DOUBLE-CHECK CORPORATION in Miami in first quarter of 1961."

(The authoritative book, "The Invisible Government," identified Double-Check Corp.)

"WE HAVE NO current contact available to inform of this situation," the letter continues. "So I took the liberty of writing you direct and apprising you of current situation ... expecting you to forward this through appropriate channels."

"Our connection and activity of that period involved individuals presently about to be indicted as conspirators in Mr. Garrison's investigation."

"We have temporarily avoided one subpena not to reveal Double-Check activities or associate them with this mess. We want out of this thing before Thursday 3/ /67. Our attorneys have been told to expect another suppena to appear and testify on this matter. The Fifth Amendment and of immunity (and) legal tactics will not suffice."

"MR. GARRISON is in possession of unsworn portions of this testimony. He is aware of Double-Check's involvement in this matter but has strong skepticism. I have been questioned extensively by local FBI recently as to whether or not I was involved with Double-Check's parent holding corporation during the time. My reply on five queries was negative."

14 August 1968

SUBJECT: GUGAS, Chris

Subject is identified as a California investigator who administered a polygraph test to Edgar Eugene BRADLEY who has been charged with conspiracy by GARRISON.

Subject was born 12 August 1921 at Omaha, Nebraska. He is a former Agency employee who EOD in October 1949 as a GS-9 Intelligence Officer. Subject resigned his staff status in February 1951 and became a staff agent with Project ENDOMORPH in Turkey from March 1951 until July 1952. (His wife Anne Claudia GUGAS nee SETARO was granted a covert security clearance in February 1952 for use in a clerical capacity in the Middle East.)

In his assignment with Project ENDOMORPH in Turkey, Subject was a source of constant embarrassment in his contacts with Turkish police officials. He was boastful, indiscreet, lacking in sound judgment, knew little or nothing in the fields in which he was self-professedly an expert and was guilty of security breaches in failing to maintain his cover. In one incident he made recommendations of police reorganizations to be made by province governors in Turkey whereas, in Turkey, the Police Department is a national organization and not subject to the dictates of the province governors. This caused much ill will and friction with the Turkish police.

Subject professed to be an expert in his knowledge of the polygraph machine and claimed he had two years' experience with the Los Angeles Police Department prior to his employment with the Agency. However, it was developed that instead of this claimed experience, he had actually spent one or two weeks in a detective school connected with the Los Angeles Police Department where he received below average grades.

In October 1952 he approached an Agency employee regarding a new type of technical equipment and this conversation led to the disclosure by Subject that he was employed by the Agency in a covert capacity; that he was teaching lie detection techniques to foreign police departments without being authorized or competent to do so. Subject was briefed in December 1952 with stress placed on the importance of living up to his security responsibilities and exercising utmost precaution in protecting the covert interests of the Agency.

In spite of the strong warnings given him in this interview, Subject again became involved in an incident of official embarrassment to the Agency.

In March 1953 he misrepresented himself as a polygraph operator with the "State Department Secret Police". This misrepresentation was made at a time when the Department of State was not authorized to have a polygraph machine and Congressional legislation was pending at the time regarding such authorization. As a result of this misrepresentation, Subject was afforded another security interview in March 1953. He explained that his cover company sold equipment to foreign countries through the Mutual Aid Program and supplied consultant services to the State Department but Subject denied that he ever represented himself as a State Department polygraph operator. After the security interview Subject was also assessed by an Agency psychologist (March 1953) and was found to be egotistical, emotionally unstable, possessed of a need to build himself up in the eyes of others and gave either exaggerated or completely erroneous information as to his past positions. His intelligence quotient was found to be comparatively low in relation to those of other Agency employees. In April 1953 termination of his employment was recommended.

Subject resigned 29 April 1953 "to accept a position in California. Washington climate is not agreeable to his family."

In April 1964 Mr. J. Kirk BAREFOOT, Director of Becurity, McKesson and Robbins, Skokie, Illinois, informed the Agency he had been a witness to unauthorized disclosures of classified information made by a group in a cocktail lounge in Omaha, Nebraske. The individual making the disclosures / about *ENDOMORPH* activities abroad under Agency sponsorship was identified as Leonard HARRELSON. Subject, who was then Director of Public Safety for the City of Omaha, Nebraska, was one of the group and it was believed that he was responsible for supplying the classified information to HARRELSON about *ENDOMORPH* activities.

Leonard HARRELSON is a private investigator specializing in hypnotiom and the use of the polygraph machine. In 1964 he was employed by the Keeler Polygraph Company in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954 HARRELSON was in partnership with Lloyd B. FURR in a private detective agency known as the American Bureau of Investigation, Tower Building, Washington, D. C. Lloyd B. FURR is the polygraph operator who gave a lie detector test to Gordon NOVEL, hostile witness subpoenaed by GARRISON. The test received newspaper publicity as being given at "Mclean, Va." in March 1967. (Summery on FURR attached).

HARRELSON is believed to be a person of poor morals. He was given a medical discharge from the Army as a psychoneurotic in 1949 and had been court-martialed twice for impersonating non-commissioned officers of a rank higher than he possessed. In his business partnership with FURR, HARRELSON would misrepresent himself as being with the FBI by covering the word "Americon" when presenting his credentials and just showing "Bureau of Investigation".

Incidentally, the informant, J. Kirk BAREFOOT mentioned above, was disapproved for Agency employment in 1951 because of falsification of his FHS, and questionable maturity, judgment, discretion and honesty.

ANOVEL is Polygraphed by Lloyd FURR on Garrison's Charges.

Gordon wane NOVEL, already a fugitive witness in the Garrison inquiry, is reported in the Washington press of 27 Marie 1967 as having been polygraphed the previous day on the case under investigation by Garrison. According to the press reports, NOVEL submitted to a polygraph examination conducted at McLean, Virginia by Lloyd FURR. In statemente to the press, FORR indicated there was no indication of deception to NOVEL's charges that Garrison's case is a fraud.

## B. Lloyd FURR's Relationship to Richard L. BAST and REDEX.

Lloyd FURR, a former District of Columbia policeman and now a private detective, is a self-proclaimed polygraph "expert" and sound device specialist. He has received publicity in the past for planting sound devices for the late Fulton Lewis, Jr. in the it. Mary's County vice case in 1953 and in 1958 when ha discovered listening devices being used against Bernard Goldfine. In 1964, information was received that a Washington, D. C. iteer REDEX, operated by FURR and Richard L. BAST, was attempting to sell electronic equipment to Communist China via an agent in Hong Kong. (TSD had unclassified contact with FURR in 1962 to see equipment offered for sale by FURR.)

## C. Richard L. BAST and REDEX.

Richard L. BAST, a Washington, D. C. private detective, gained notoriety in 1965 by turning up a missing witness, previously unlocated by the Department of Justice, in connection with the Lobby Baker case. He is known to operate at least four enterprises: 1) CAPITAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, a private detective agency; 2) REDEX VIETNAM, INC., a firm which imports a variety of commodities ranging from liquor to automobiles into South Vietnam, including, of late, U. S.-recruited Kors for a Saigon nightclub he is planning; 3) REDEX CORP., a firm which sells almost anything to anybody abroad, other than South Vietnam; and 4) CONSOLIDATED ARMAMENTS, a firm which sells small arms to foreign governments and private individuals abroad. BAST also produces and distributes audio and counteraudio devices in the U. S. and

D. BAST, EDEN, and William W. TURNER of RAMPARTS

GA Staff has provided information that during January 1967, William W. TURNER, who identified himself as a free-lancer writer, visited the offices of the Asia Foundation, requesting information for a magazine article. He stated that he had been asked by Sol Stern of New York to gather information for an article in the *New York Times*. During his visit, however, it became obvious that TURNER was primed to ask questions about the financing of the foundation, rather than its actual purpose or activities. When TURNER concluded the interview he left a calling card with the firm name "REDEX-PACIFIC". He explained he had to have new cards printed. TURNER, reportedly dismissed from the FBI in 1961, is noted to have authored an article in the November 1966 issue of *RAMPARTS Magazine* in which he describes alleged wiretapping, surreptitious entry, etc., performed by him while with the FBI. Sol Stern, whom he claimed to represent, is assistant managing editor of *RAMPARTS Magazine*.

E. Role of FURR and BAST in CIA Meeting of Exile

(The foregoing has attempted to detail the contact of NOVEL with FURR. FURR's connection with BAST, and a possible connection between BAST's organization and RAMPARTS. The following indicates the only CIA involvement in the chain which might be exploited in subsequent attempts to link CIA to the entry affair in question.)

WH75. in which he documented a conversation he had on 27 April 1963, with Raymond CASSAGNOL, an anti-Duvalier exile from Haiti. In the memorandum he relates that the conversation took place in the home of Richard L. BAST whom he had met through a neighbor, Lloyd FURR.

The memorandum relates CASSAGNOL's background, family, political stance, etc. Reported as significant by [Owen] is a statement by BAST that the following week BAST would be sending a shipload of arms to a CASSAGNOL-affiliated group in the Dominican Republic. [Owen] noted: "Raymond CASSAGNOL gives appearance of thinking well of Richard BAST. According to CASSAGNOL, his brother, Jacques, also knows BAST and respects him. Thus EAST, in spite of certain personal shortcomings from the intelligence standpoint, does represent an established channel to at least one segment of the Haitian opposition to Duvalier. Since according to his own statement, BAST is supplying arms to CASSAGNOL's groups, further transactions of this type via BAST presumably would not be difficult to arrange." He also provided a detailed information on what he learned of BAST, noting that BAST had mentioned Dominican distrust of State and AID and the fact that "CIA double crossed them" (the Dominicans).

An FBI report on BAST dated 19 June 1963 reports that [Owen], Foreign Service Reserve Officer, USDS" (his cover) had reported 16 May 1963 his attendance at dinner at BAST's home on 27 April 1963 [Owen] told of his meeting with CASSAGNOL. BAST's intention to sell arms to the Dominican Republic and Haitians also, etc. He also reports that on 7 May 1963. BAST asked him to perform some translation work. The translation, he stated, related to BAST giving a power of attorney to one Luis DURMO Martinez of the Dominican Republic to prepare documentation for legal establishment of REDEX CORPORATION, a DR branch of BAST's firm. According to [Owen] the stock was to be held by the head of the DR National Security Agency, the head of the DR secret police, and an individual well-connected with Dominican Republic police and intelligence groups. BAST is also noted to have told [Owen] of an offer BAST had made to "bug" the office of the Dominican

15 January 1968

SUBJECT: BRADLEY, Edgar Eugene
(See files BRADLEY, Leslie Norman)

## ALLEGATION:

Edgar Eugene BRADLEY, field representative for an Eastern radio evangelist, Dr. Carl McINTIRE, was arrested on 29-Dec-1967 on a charge by GARRISON of being a conspirator in a plot to assassinate President KENNEDY.

## SOURCE:

News media articles for 23, 24, 26, 28 Dec 1967 and 3 Jan 68.

## CIA CONNECTION:

None. Personnel records reveal there was an applicant by the same name as Subject but the file was destroyed in Dec 1966 as it was 2 yrs old. Subject's employer, Carl McINTIRE was approved for contact use in Nov 1954 but according to Contacts Office, he was never used by them as he was reported to be unreliable.

## OS INDICES RESULTS:

Negative on Subject.

His employer, Carl McINTIRE, was approved (caution) for contact use on 22 November 1954. However, according to Domestic Contacts Office, he was not used by them as he was reported to be unreliable. His file reflects that he is an extreme Rightist. He spoke on "How Communism is Using the Churches" in Hollywood, California on 14 December 1954. On 30 April 1954 an article in the New York Herald Tribune quoted him as saying "the seriousness of Communism in the churches is far greater than we realize". TIME magazine for 16 May 1964 identified him as the founder and head of the small American Council of Christian Churches which it described as "the farthest tip" of the right wing of American Protestantism. The LUTHERAN magazine for 30 December stated that the revised Standard Version of the Bible has been a target of incessant attack by Carl McINTIRE and his "Twentieth Century Reformation Hour" broadcasts.

## DETAILS:

Subject is alleged that his arrest by GARRISON is a case of mistaken identity. RAMPARTS magazine for 8 January 1968 reported that it seemed possible indeed that GARRISON had him mixed up with two other men." (One is sometime lease pilot named BRADLEY who was once jailed in Cuba for anti-Castro activities. The other, an ex-con who used the alias BRADLEY and who changed to BRAUEY on a bad-check charge in Dallas on 22 November 1966.)

# Garrison's 'Baseless Fraud'

The former chief investigator in the New Orleans assassination "plot" testified last week that District Attorney Jim Garrison's conspiracy theory is a "base less fraud."

William H. Gurvich, who worked with Garrison for seven months in probing the Kennedy assassination, swore that the entire "plot" was a figment of the D.A.'s imagination. He testified in an Ohio extradition hearing in which Garrison sought the return for testimony of Gordon Novel, a former New Orleans resident. Gurvich also said that:

*   Garrison once predicted the assassination probe would end with the suicide of his chief defendant, Clay Shaw, who is charged with conspiracy.

*   Another defendant, Edgar Eugene Bradley, has been confused by Garrison with a second Edgar Bradley, an anti-Castro pilot. But Gurvich said investigation indicated that neither Bradley played any part in the assassination.

*   Garrison once ordered Gurvich to arrest, handcuff and assault two NBC newsmen, Walter Sheridan and Richard Townley, who had expressed skepticism of the Garrison probe.

# Novel 'Tired Fighting,' Will Return to N.O.

Gordon Novel, long-sought witness in the Kennedy assassination probe, says he will return to New Orleans.

Novel, a former nightclub owner, left the city abruptly last year when District Attorney Jim Garrison sought to question him. But he said yesterday in Columbus, Ohio, he is "tired of fighting" and will appear before the grand jury here March 7 and 8.

HOWEVER, Novel said he knows nothing he can tell the jury in connection with Garrison's allegation that the slaying of President John F. Kennedy was plotted in New Orleans.

"I think it's time to bring this to a head. I want to have a home and raise a family," Novel said at a news conference with his wife, former Playboy bunny 'Abby Mulligan.

Garrison contends Novel and Kerry Thornley, the former French Quarter waiter charged yesterday with perjury, both were connected with the federal government here before the assassination. Novel, Garrison has claimed, worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.

Thornley, Garrison said yesterday, was "part of the covert federal operation operating in New Orleans" in 1963, along with Lee Harvey Oswald, Thornley's one-time Marine Corps buddy.

The perjury charge grew out of Thornley's statements that he never saw Oswald here during 1963.

GARRISON contends that persons associated with the CIA killed the President.

In an interview made public yesterday in which Garrison was questioned by a Dutch television reporter, the DA was quoted as saying "the next U.S. President who tries to put the brakes on the war machine" will also be slain.

Garrison was quoted on The Netherlands Television Foundation by Willem Oltmans as saying Kennedy was killed by "elements" of the CIA and the organization then tried to cast suspicion on others,

"This manner of organizing a murder is standard procedure with the CIA," Garrison was quoted as saying.

GARRISON was quoted in the Dutch interview as saying that he had to speak out in Europe "because it is impossible in America.

"The U.S. press is controlled! to such an extent by the CIA! that we no longer can say! the truth. They throttled us,"! he was quoted in the broadcast on the program 'Panoramiek.'

The television foundation! quoted Garrison as saying he assumed President Lyndon B. Johnson knew of the CIA's alleged involvement because the Warren Commission was comprised of persons Garrison sald were favorable to the CIA..

Garrison also asserted that she has succeeded in identifying the assassination of President Kennedy as an operation conducted by elements of the CIA. The DA further charged that the Warren Commission suppressed certain documents which may have a bearing on the case.

Garrison also claimed that Ferrie, and had visited many times with attorney Dean A. Andrews Jr., who has since been convicted of perjury after testifying in connection with the probe.

LINKED TO BRADLEY

Information has been given to the DA's office which located Novel at No Name Key in Florida, where a number of CIA employes were training for an invasion of Cuba," the request added.

It further says that Novel has associated with Edgar Eugene Bradley of North Hollywood, California, the second living man, along with retired New Orleans businessman Clay L. Shaw, to be charged by Garrison with conspiring to kill President Kennedy.

"Gordon Novel, by his own public admissions, sold his business and left the city to avoid not only the aforedescribed subpena (of March 17, 1967) but also a new, subpena which he knew had been issued but not served," continued the request.

"Subsequent to the issuance of the warrant (for his arrest as a material witness), Gordon Novel disguised himself in the clothing of a member of a particular religious order and by stealth and furtiveness returned to the state of Louisiana and removed his auotmobile."

by the Warren Commission to and Dulles say they will be granted immunity from arrest in Louisiana on matters which may have occurred before their entrance into the state to comply with the subpena order.

Dulles now lives in New York and Novel has been residing in Columbus, Ohio, since fleeing Louisiana last year.

The call for Novel also alleges that he was an associate of Ferrie, and had visited many times with attorney Dean A. Andrews Jr., who has since been convicted of perjury after testifying in connection with the probe.

GRANTED IMMUNITY

The Subpena request further stated that Novel, former operator of a Rampart st lounge, had enlisted CLA aid in order to avoid having to return to New Orleans for Garrison, and that the late Davidow Ferrie was employed by the CIA while Dulles was at the helm.

Ferrie died last Feb 22. He was named by Garrison as being one of the alleged conspirators in plotting the murder of Kennedy.

In his statement to The Times-Picayune, Novel outlined-his-position on Garrison's latest move in five points. The text of Novel's statement follows:

"Number One My primary business in New Orleans was, and still is in the electronic intelligence equipment manufacturing field. I am not a night club owner. That was merely a hobby.

Garrison Asks Dulles to Testify March 8

A new subpena and a renewed subpena were issued Friday by District Attorney Jimy Garrison in his Kennedy assassination probe-the first for an former Central Intelligence Agency director and the second for a long-sought former bar operator alleged to have CIA connections.

The new Grand Jury's subpena issued by Garrison's office was for Allen W. Dulles, the of the controversial CIA intills Sept. 27, 1961, who is asked to appear before the Orleans Parish Grand Jury March 8 and to give testimony in connection with the DA's s investigation of President John F. Kennedy.

The other subpena called for Gordon Novel. Earlier efforts for, the appearance Garrison to have Novel in here, to testify have been in

The subpenas for both Dulles and Novel were Issued through the court of Criminal District Judge Matthew S. Braniff.

# Dulles Called in Probe

The district attorney's office today issued a grand jury subpena for Allen M. Dulles former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, to appear before the jury March 7 and 8 in connection with the probe of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

A new subpena also was issued today for Gordon Novel, former New Orleans nightclub owner. Previous efforts to get Novel back to New Orleans to testify have been unsuccessful.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY JIM GARRISON said his office has succeeded in identifying the assassination of President Kennedy as an operation conducted by elements of the CIA," and said both Dulles and Novel were needed to testify about CIA activities.

Both subpenas were issued through. Criminal District Judge Matthew S. Braniff.

The request for the Dulles subpena alleges that Dulles was CIA director until. Sept. 27, 1961, and as such "would have pertinent knowledge as to substantial reports that Lee Harvey Oswald was an agent and-or an employe of the CIA."

THE DOCUMENT SAID POSSIBLE information relative to CIA knowledge or contact with Oswald (named by the Warren Commission as the sole slayer of the President) was suppressed in certain commission documents.

It charges that while Dulles headed the CIA, the organ-ization negotiated with a New Orleans firm for the purchase of trucks and vehicles to use in the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and used the name of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was at that time in Russia.

THE SUBPENA REQUEST QUOTED a copyrighted story in the States-Item April 25, 1967, as. making public-Novel's claim to have been employed by the CIA during Dulles' tenure as chief. "Gordon Novel fled the state to avoid testifying and sought to enlist the aid of the CIA in preventing his return," the document said..

The request said "David W. Ferrie, who has been named in an indictment as a conspirator to the murder of John F. Kennedy, was an employe of the CIA at a time when Allen Dulles was the head of the CIA. Among other things, he was a flying instructor in Guatemala prior to the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion."

Dulles was never called before the Warren Commission, the document said..

The document said it was issued for the purpose of being presented to a judge in New York, "where said Allen W. Dulles now is, upon proceedings to compel said Allen W. Dulles to attend and testify..."

Both the Dulles and Novel subpena requests contain provisions granting the men immunity from arrest and process service, while in Louisiana on matters which arose prior to their entrance into the state to answer the subpenas.

IN THE PAST, Garrison has refused to grant. Novel such immunity. Novel has said he would be willing to return if it were granted.

The Novel subpena request says Novel now lives in Columbus, Ohio.

It alleges that Novel "by his own admission in public statements is affiliated with the CIA."

It further alleges that Novel "has been established to be a frequent visitor of and associate of attorney Dean A: Andrews who has been convicted of perjury in connection with his testimony relative to the conspiracy to murder John F. Kennedy."

ALSO, IT says he was an associate of Ferrie in connection with CIA activities.

"Information has been given to the DA's office which located Novel at No Name Key in Florida where a number of CIA employes were training for an invasion of Cuba," the request said.

It also says Novel has been identified by a witness as a frequent visitor of Edgar Eugene Bradley in North Hollywood, Callt. Bradley has been charged in Orleans Parish as a conspirator in the Kennedy slaying.

Novel, the request says, has been identified by various witnesses as having been in various places in Dallas in 1963 which are under investigation by the DA's office.

"Gordon Novel has information on gun-running activities involving Clay L. Shaw who has been indicted by the Orleans Parish Grand Jury as a conspirator to the murder of John F. Kennedy, and Jack Ruby, whom it is commonly accepted is the slayer of Lee Harvey Oswald," the document says.

IT SAYS Steven Plotkin, Novel's attorney, when-pressed for information relativ to the gun-running activities asserted the attorney-client privilege and named Gordon Novel as the client involved.

The document requests that Novel be taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of the state of Louisiana to assure his attendance.

It says Novel was subpenaed to appear before the grand jury March 17, 1967; and adds:

"Gordon Novel, by his own public admissions, sold his business on the weekend and left the city to avoid not only the aforedescribed subpena but also a new subpena which

# CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM
RELEASE IN FULL 1998

SUBJECT: NOVEL, Gordon
(See also FURR, Lloyd B.)
(See also ARCACHA-SMITH, Sergio)

8 February 1968

ALLEGATION:

Gordon NOVEL, former owner of a French Quarter Bar in New Orleans, was subpoenaed by GARRISON as a material witness in March 1967 but NOVEL moved to Columbus, Ohio and has avoided extradition. GARRISON charged NOVEL with burglary of the Houma Munitions Bunker in 1961 together with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. NOVEL claimed this was a CIA operation but later his attorney denied the story.

SOURCE:

Numerous news items, the latest dtd in October 1967.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March 1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with a burglary of a monitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana in 1961, together with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left New Orleans, first going to McLean, Virginia where he was given a lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective. (See summary on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's proximity to McLean, Va.

After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967 a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-ITEM, Hoke MAY.

CIA CONNECTION:

None


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

# SECRET

Hoke MAY was granted a Covert Security Approval in April 1958 for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly employed by FJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his position with a private firm which handled work for the Project. The letter was presumably written to a "Mr. WEISS" in CIA and referred to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVEL claimed he was involved. This matter was reviewed by CI/R&A at the time the matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE-CHEK was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to the widows of American flyers who participated in the Bay of Pigs. No connection with NOVEL could be established. NOVEL knew Sergio ARCACHA-SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti-Castro organization. Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEL could have gained an impression from him that he was employed by CIA.

In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from arest by GARRISON on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned to Louisiana to testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana.

## DETAILS:

The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker. However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967, that Colonel BURBANK was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that BURBANK and NOVEL knew each other. BURBANK testified that every Louisiana sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

# Novel Says Munitions Theft 'Set Up' by Agency-

# Evidence Links CIA to DA Probe

(Copyri, by the New Orleans States-Item, The Times-ay Publishing Corp. and The Dayton (Ohio) Daily Days.)

Do the long tentacles of the Central Intel- rence Agency reach deep into Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's Kennedy death plot investigation?

There is mounting evidence they do, and at least one Garrison probe figure intends to use CIA connections as part of his defense.

Still others linked to the Garrison investiga- tion have been named as acting for the super secretpionage organization — as informers, as communitions carriers.

EVEN INVESTIGATION'S PIVOTAL 54-yor old Clay L. Shaw, has had CIA con- tons attrated to him. Shaw, charged with com- icity in Kenedy's death, was linked with the CIA by an influential Italian newspaper.

The strongest CIA ties lead to Gordon Novel, a 29-year-old fugitive witness who is fighting extra- dition at Columbus, Ohio.

Novel, a one-time New Orleans bar owner and This story is the joint effort of Hoke May, David Snyder, Ross Yockey, and Rosemary James of the States-item and R. T. Endicoty of the Day- ton (sic, Daily News.

elder.bics expert, has told a number of friends and intimates he was a CIA operative and will use this role to battle Garrison's charges.

The defense will be laid down, Novel says, if he is returned to New Orleans to face accusations that he burglarized an oil service company's muni- tions bunker in nearby Terrebonne Parish.

NOVEL'S ATTORNEY AT NEW ORLEANS, Steven Plotkin, would not deny his client's reported statements.

"I will neither confirm nor deny them," Plotkin said.

Novel is free in Columbus on $10,000 bond. He was arrested April 1 in suburban Gahanna, Ohio, on Garrison's warrant charging he helped plan the muni- tions burglary in 1961.

He is accused both of conspiracy and burglary along with 44-year-old Sergio Arsacha Smith of Dallas, once the leader of a militant anti-Castro or- ganization in New Or- leans. Garrison charg- es they conspired with another key JFK probe figure, David W Ferrie, to stage the munitions theft.

Ferrie was a strange, hairless for- mer airline pilot who died of what the Orleans Parish coroner called "natural causes" five days

TO POLYGRAPH OPERATORS AND TO nds and associates, Novel has said the munitions burglary was no burglary at all but a war. ma- lemals pickup made at the direction of his CIA contact.

Novel called the munitions incident most patriotic burglary in history" during a recent news interview. He immediately was shushed by his Columbus lawyer, Jerry Weiner.

Even more recently, Novel restated his charges against Garrison in a vlined story carried by The Dayton Daily More Dryptically, he said, "I think Garrison will expose Me A operations in Louisiana." He did not elaborate.

His off-repeated but unpublished account of how the evalcaves disappeared describes the bunker he says he helped empty as a CIA staging point for munitions destined to be used as part of the abortive Bay of Pigs attack on Castro's Cuba in April, 1961.

PRIOR TO THAT DISASTROUS CIA-staged operation, Novel says, he was wetting for the intelligence service at New Orleans.art of job, he contends, was to operate the Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front-for-CIA com- munications.

With funds funneledini by the CIA, Novel says he prepared special radio commercials used on 300 stations in the U.S. and Canada. Their cryptographic messages, he claims, were alert agents to the invasion date. The com- mercials advertised aluminum Christmas trees, he says, and the key alert code names were "Star Christmas Trees" and "Holiday Trees." In late 1960, $72,000 worth of radio time was placed by the agency..

On the day the munitions were picked up, he says, he was called by his CIA contact and told to join a group which was ordered to transport munitions from the bunker to New Orleans. The key to the bunker, he says, was provided.

HE SAYS HE MADE THE TRIP in his own automobile, Lincoln, and met several people there - all of them al- iegedly acting for the CIA. He identifies them as Ferrie, Arcacha, several Cubans, and another figure in the case. They loaded the bases of ordnance on trucks, he con- Unues, and rerned to New Orleans where the explosives e dropped three pots - Ferrie's home, Novel's office kilding and the office of a stormy former FBI agent and New Orleans police official, Guy Banister, who died of a the summer of 1964.

APR 25 1967

A AACHAU UL NOUNSEL S' man whose wora is considerea reliable, told a reporter .ew Orleans he saw 50 to 100 boxes of munitions in Baluster's Lafayette st. office early in 1961.

Banister was a private detective then, operating a company called Guy Banister Associates. His friend said he saw the munitions in a storeroom-office, in boxes marked with the name "Schlumberger."

HE SAYS FIVE OR SIX OF THE BOXES were open. Inside, he says, were rifle grenades, land mines and some "little missiles" of a kind he had never seen before. The friend said he remonstrated with Banister because "fooling with this kind of stuff could get you in trouble." He added:

"Banister said no, it was all right, that he had approval from somebody He said the stuff would just be there over- night, that somebody was supposed to pick it up. He said a bunch of fellows connected with the Cuban deal asked to leave it there overnight."

Banister's friend said this happened well before the April Bay of Pigs invasion.

The munitions, Novel says, were picked up and con- solidated soon after the New Orleans drops. He says they eventually were taken by boat to Cuba for use in a diver- sionary operation staged in conjunction with the Bay of Pigs attack.

Cuban sources in New Orleans say the cadre of Cubans trained by the CIA on the city's West Bank in 1961 was sent to Varacoa to make a diversionary assault. The at- tack did not come off because. Castro militia was waiting and took the group prisoner.

NOVEL'S ACCOUNT OF THE explosives caper sharply: conflicts with Garrison's charges against Arcacha and Novel. The DA's accusation says the burglary took place after Aug. 1, 1961-three months after the Cuban disaster.

The DA accuses the two men of conspiring to burglarize a bunker at an abandoned military base at Houma. Gar- rison's bill of information says the bunker was leased by. the Schlumberger Well Services Co. of Houston.

Schlumberger officials say they know nothing of any CIA operations in connection with their magazine, where oil field service equipment and certain low yield explosives are stored.

As to the date the Houma burglary happened, no one seems to know or will say exactly when it took place. Schlumberger says it has no records. The Houma police say their records are missing, and the Terrebonne Parish DA, Wilmore Broussard, will not reveal the date he charges Arcacha and Novel burglarized the Houmą bunker. He said it is "material evidence" in his case.

PLOTKIN SAYS HE MADE A TRIP to Houma to get the date of his client's alleged offense and could not ob- tain it.

Shaw, a tall white-haired retired New Orleans business- man, who stoutly denies participating in a plot to kill Kennedy, was managing director of the International Trade Mart. He was with the organization for 19 years and in a favorable position to observe the movements of international commerce through America's second-ranking seaport.

On March 4, Paese Sera, an afternoon newspaper in Rome, carried a story which said Shaw is a director of a firm known as World Trade Center Corp. The newspaper, which is leftist in its political leanings, claimed the com- pany was a CIA front operation.

It said the company moved its operations from Switzer- land to Rome and has since transferred its offices to Johan- nesburg, South Africa, where it is still in existence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 116

THE SAME STORY, MINUS THE CIA allegation, was published in Rome's conservative newspaper *De la Sera*, on March 5.

Incidental to his own story, Novel tells intimates the CIA may have asked Shaw to observe the traffic of foreign commerce through New Orleans.

In Ohio, Novel continues to live his free, loquacious life while waiting for the uncertain extradition machinery to grind away between governors' offices at Baton Rouge and Columbus.

He lives in a rent free apartment, drives a used car with dealer's tags and continues to promise he will send "Garrison down the drain" when what he says is the full truth is revealed.

## Novel Not CIA Agent--Weiner

The Columbus, Ohio, attorney for Kennedy death plot investigation figure Gordon Novel said today that his client was never an agent for the CIA.

Attorney Jerry Weiner was commenting on a copyrighted story in the *States Item* and the *Dayton (Ohio) Daily News* which reported evidence of links between Novel and the CIA.

"It's utterly ridiculous," he said. "Novel is not now and never has been a CIA agent."

At Dallas, Sergio Argacha Smith declined comment on Novel's quoted account of the mysterious munitions incident at Houma in 1961. He told a reporter he would not have "anything to say about anything."

At Washington, meanwhile, the CIA was mum on the story.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: GARRISON and the Kennedy Assassination;
Gordon Dwane NOVEL

1. Summary of contents.

Gordon Dwane NOVEL has both claimed and denied affiliation with CIA. A thorough records check has shown no such affiliation, It seems plausible that the NBC is supporting and financing NOVEL in order to win a large audience for a later expose of GARRISON. In support of this plan NBC or NOVEL may have exaggerated his presumed relationship with Sergio ARCACHA Smith (who was also not CIA employed) into an Agency affiliation and may have staged a dramatic ambush in Nashville. The NBC program, however, is reportedly still weeks away, and meanwhile GARRISON is attacking CIA vehemently.

2. Gordon Dwane NOVEL and his lawyers reportedly have claimed that he was associated with CIA, but have then denied such an association. One lawyer later reiterated the claim.

3. The files of the following Agency components have been checked for any record of Gordon Dwane NOVEL, including alternative spellings. All checks were negative (CIA held no information about NOVEL before the GARRISON probe started,)

a. RID.
b. CI/OA.
c. Office of Security,
d. WH/Cuban Operations Group,
e. Domestic Contact Service.

4. NOVEL remaine mysterioue, Although the prese has devoted much space to him, few facte have emerged, He has been desgribed as a 29 year old former owner of a bar in the French quarter rter of New Orleans and as an o expert in electronice, (New Orleane States - *Item*, 25 April 1967.) An FBI report (DDB-79248, 27 April 1967) terma bim a farmer electronica salgsman.

5. Nothing has been printed about the source or sources of his money since he left New Orleans for Columbus, Ohio, in mid-March 1967. It is known, however, that he is at liberty on a $10,000 bond, The New Orleans States - *Item* said on 25 April 1967 that NOVEL lives In a rentefree apartment in Columbus and drives a used car with dealer's tags,

6. The Washington Daily News of 27 March 1967 stated that during the weekend of 25-26 March NOVEL was in the Washington area (actually it was McLean, Virginia, a site which might have been chosen to land an air of plausibility to his claims of working for CIA). There he was given a polygraph examination by a private detective named Lloyd FURR. (Comment: As the Office of Security reported on 1 May 1967, the Washington firm REDEX is operated by FURR and Richard L. BAST, who is described as "unscrupulous and untrustworthy". BAST produces and sells, among other things, audio and counter-audio devices The fact that NOVEL was a salesman of electronica gear suggests the otherwise unsupported hypothesis that he may have had an earlier rola-clonship with REDEX, BAST, OF FURR)

7. On 29 March 1967 the New Orleang FBI office reported (file 89-69) that NOVEL had made a long distange call to that office from an unknown place. Among his remarks was the comment that he bad "not furnished GARRISON with any information about 'double check' of Miami, which he inferred was a fringe Cuban operation in the Miami area but did not further identify." (Gomment: Operation Double Chok appears on pp. 95, 76, 82, 84, 88, 89, 90, 146, and 246 of *The Invisible Government*, by David Wise and Thomas B. Ross, The book erroneously

describes Double Chek as a cover and funding mechanism for recruiting and paying American flyers who participated at the. Bay of Pigs, The General Counsel has informad CI/R&A that in fact Double Chok was created after the deaths of the flyers for the sole purpose of making payments to their widowa.

8. FBI memorandum DBB 76600, 29 March 1967, reported another long distance call by NOVEL to the New Orleans office, NOVEL said that Walter SHERIDAN, who is a Washington NBC news reporter, had the number of the telephone at which NOVEL could be reached. He also said that when he was given the polygraph test in Virginia. SHERIDAN was present, He added that he had given SHERIDAN informa- tion about polygraph tests run by GARRISON's staff,

9. An & May 1967 memorandum from the Associate General Counsel states that he was given information about the GARRISON in- vestigation by a Washington lawyer named Jack Miller, that Walter SHERIDAN was the source of Miller's information, that NBC has done a thirty minute show on GARRISON, and that it plans an hour-long show "for a few weeks from now", The show is expected to "bury" GARRISON.

10. In addition to his reference to Double Chek, NOVEL and his lawyern have made direct but contradictory statements about CIA.

a. "I think Garrison will expose some CIA operations in New Orleans." (New Orleans Times - Picayune, 19 April 1967.1

b. NOVEL reportedly stated to a representative of a well known nowe media "that he was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CLA) and that the burglary of the munitions bunker at Houma. Louisiana, was not an actual burglary," He contended that CIA bad mada arrangements with the SCHLUMBERGER Well Drilling Corporation to keep ammunition, bomb casings, and other material in that bunker. He "indicated that he (NOVEL) and Sergio/ Arcacha Smith are still employed by the CIA." NOVEL and others took bomb casings and other items from the bunker about three months after the Bay of Pigs, (Source: FBI memorandum, New Orleans office, 20 April 1967.) (Comment; Careful checking has shown that CIA did not have a contract with

SCHLUMBERGER, as NOVEL has alleged, and did not have any munitions or similar materials stored with SCHLUMBERGER or at the Houma Air Base.)

c. The above "war materials pickup" was made by NOVEL and others "at the direction of his CIA contact." Part of NOVEL's job for CIA "was to operate the Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front for CIA communications". NOVEL prepared special radio commercials for use in the United States and Canada,,,to alert agents to the date of the Bay of Pigs invasion," Among code words used by NOVEL were "Star Christmas Trees" and "Holiday Trees". Hie agency placed $72.000 worth of radio time in 1960. (AP. New Orleans, 25 April 1967.) (Comment: As was previously reported, there is no record of the "Evergreen Advertising Agency". WH/COG queried a knowledgeable staff employee, now COS in [Santo Domingo], who replied in [Santo Domingo]16-10 3473, 12 May 1967, that NOVEL's allegations are not true; that he had never heard of NOVEL, his agency, or the code words, and that although "some meaningless code phrases were used on JMHOPE for psych reasons only", they were not sent out over U.S., commercial stations. The cable added that the Cuban Free Committee did contract time for routine exile broadcasts on a Now Orleans station. It is clear, however, that NOVEL's allegations do not concern such broadcasts.)

d. Steven PLOTKIN, NOVEL's lawyer in New Orleans, said that he would neither confirm por deny NOVEL's claima of CIA employment. His lawyer in Columbus, Jerry WEINER. said, "It's utterly ridiculous, NOVEL is not now and never has been a CIA agent," (New Orleans States - Item, 25 April 1967.)

e. On 25 April 1967 NOVEL himself said in Columbus, "The statements that I worked for the CIA arg absolutely in- correct.",,, (AP. 25 April 1967.)

1. NOVEL'a New Orleans attorney, Steve PLOTKIN, said he "served as an intermediary between the CIA and anti-Castro Cubans in New Orleans and Miami before the April, 1961, Bay of Pige invasion, Plotkin maintained, though, that Novel had little or nothing to do with the Bay of Pigs invasion and certainly had absolutely nothing to do with the assassination of President Kennedy.'" (The Washington Post, 26 May 1967.)

11. On 7 May 1967 NOVEL again telephoned the FBI's office in New Orleans. He said that in the near future GARRISON would accuse the FBI of possessing originala of five letterst one from Clay SHAW to David FERRIE, one from Lee Harvey OSWALD to SHAW, one from FERRIE to Jack RUBY, one from RUBY to OSWALD, and one from Senator and former Attorney General Robert Kennedy to FERRIE, He added that GARRISON hae a typewriter which FERRIE owned in 1963 and also has two typewriters, personal and business, belonging to SHAW. He said that GARRISON's chief investigator, William GURVICH, has
    a close relative, living in Russia, who was instrumental in designing the MIG. He remarked that GARRISON plans to subpoena an attorney. Inu MARTIN, allegedly associated with CIA, He said that Layton Patrick MARTENS was the "other" marine probably involved in the Houma bunker burglary. (FBI memorandum DBB 80563, 9 May 1967.) (Comment: Mr. Arthur Dooley of Cl/RhA know a Walter SHERIDAN who is believed identical with the Walter SHERIDAN of this report, who was an FBI special agent, and who worked for Senator Robert Kennedy when he was Attorney General.)

12. On or about 11 May 1967 GARRISON accused two lawyers, one of them PLOTKIN, of receiving CIA money. "We know that Mr. Plotkin has been receiving money, if only through an intermediary. from the CIA," Both lawyers denied the charge. (New Orleans, AP, 11 May 1967.) GARRISON later broadened this charge to include all defense attorneys. "Every lawyer involved in this case, without ex- ception, involved in the attempts to derall the investigation, has been connected by us with the Central Intelligence Agency, Garrison said." (Washington Post, 29 May 1967.)

13. On 22 May 1967 NOVEL telephoned an unidentified person in New Orleans and said that at 0200 hours on 21 May he and a friend of eleven years, Gary EDWARDS, were sitting in a radio station truck in Nashville, Tennessee. Bullets were fired at the truck. Neither man was struck by a bullet, but both were cut by flying glass. The Nashville police found the glass in the left door of the truck shattered and four or five indentations made by bullets on the right side of the truck's paneling. They said that the first report to them was made by Charles F. WALKER, president of radio station WKDA, who said that NOVEL had been wounded by a sniper and that he had come to Nashville at the request of WKDA and had agreed to disclose informa - tion that "would blow the New Orleans investigation wide open." A Nashville police detective said five shots ware fired at the truck and that traces, apparently of blood, were found. However, Nashville authorities noted that Mr. WALKER first telephoned them thirteen hours after the alleged incident. By then NOVEL and EDWARDS were allegedly in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Efforts made in Kentucky to verify NOVEL's claim that his injuries had been treated at a hospital were unsuccessful. WALKER said that just before the shooting NOVEL was on the verge of returning to Columbus. He said that NOVEL and EDWARDS left Nashville immediately after the shooting and that EDWARDS was proceeding to Washington, EDWARDS' real name, according to another but unidentified spokesman for the radio station, Gerald MUNDY, (New Orleans States-Item, 22 May 1967.)

14. Several newspapers have carried the story that NOVEL is suing GARRISON for $50,000,000,

15. JMWAVE was asked to show a Miami Herald photograph of NOVEL to a well placed and well informed asset, AMOT/2, without devulging NOVEL's name or making any statement about him. JMWAVE 7427, 27 May 1967, reported that AMOT/2 did not recognize the photo and could not identify the person whose likeness he saw. The purpose was to test the possibility that NOVEL had been involved in CIA activi- ties under another name,

16. It is requested that the Office of the Assistant to the Director Advise CI/R&A whether it has any information about Walter SHERIDAN,

17. If the surmise that NBC is building up NOVEL as a latter day David who is to slay the jolly green giant is correct, then a CIA exposure of NOVEL's claims of Agency affiliation as false might be damaging to our own interests. On the other hand, the likelihood that an NBC unti-Garrison program is still weeka away from presen tation is disturbing. A recent Harria survey (Washington Post, 29 May 1967) shows that 66% of the persons queried now believe that the assassination was not the work of one man but was rather part of a broader plot or conspiracy. The Garrison probe la termed a major contributor to the growing public doubt, GARRISON's venemous attack on CIA during his ABC interview of 28 May 1967. was preceded by a barrage of earlier charges and will predictably be followed by more.

18. There may be a shadow of justification for NOVEL's claim of association with CIA. He has asserted that he know Sergio ARCACHA Smith and that ARCACHA was one of the participants in the pickup at the Houma bunker. Our recorde show that CIA never recruited or paid ARGACHA directly. He was, however, the delegate of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD, or Democratic Revolutionary Front) in New Orleans. He reported to FRD headquarters in Miami by ma 11.

UNCLE H---S.O.P, Ha-ha P.S,

The partial sentence reading "...I am going to instruct
the same attorneys to sue the h--- out of your bad guys in the accounting
department for welching on your debts", quoted out of context, would
reinforce NOVEL's false claim to affiliation with CIA. It will be intere
sesting to note whether he releases this telegram to the press.

Addendum

It has been noted that NOVEL probably served as an FBI informant
for an unknown period before he left New Orleans in mid-March 1967.
FBI report DBB 73269, New Orleans office, 21 February 1967, is
ascribed to a "confidential source who in the past furnished insufficient
information to determine reliability." This source describes the group
that carried out the theft from the Houma bunker as consisting of his
own ex-wife (but not himself), his partner (unidentified), Sergio
ARCACHA Smith, David FERRIE, two ex-marines, and another man,
also unidentified. He also said that one of the cars used for the trip to
Houma was his own 1956 Lincoln Supreme. This report contains no men

# Attorney Admits Novel CIA Agent

righted story April 25.

Garrison has charged that persons connected with the CIA became angry at Kennedy and plotted his death at Dallas. He has charged the CIA with fomenting a "monstrous coverup" and duping the Warren Commission,

had little or nothing to do with the Bay of Pigs invasion and certainly had absolute- by nothing to do with the assassination of President Kennedy."

When Novel left here in mid-March, he went first to McLean; Va, to take a lie detector test. McLean is the headquarters of the CIA.

Plotkin said Novel has tapes, photographs and other data which will be released shortly and will prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that Mr. Garrison's investigation is a fraud and a hoax."

HE SAID NOVEL has turned the information over to a national news medium and that tape recordings and other matters in Plotkin's possession will be released in case Novel dies.

In the handwritten letter draft found in a hiding place at Novel's former French Quarter apartment, the fugitive tells "Mr.

"Our Attorneys and others are in possession of complete sealed files containing all information concerning this matter. In the event of our sudden departure, either accidental or otherwise, they are instructed to simultaneously release same for public scrutiny in different areas."

At the same time, the letter speaks of taking "appropriate counteraction relative to Garrison's inquisition concerning us."

It suggests that the business of handling Garrison may best be carried on "through military channels vis a vis the D.I.A. man."

D.I.A. is the abbreviation for Defense Intelligence Agency, an organization estab- lished by President Kennedy to supervise CIA after the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion.

Speaking of the letter draft today, Plotkin said the letter was intended to the addressee of th letter.

"As to the contents of the letter or whether the letter was actually sent, I don't know," he added.

"NEVERTHELESS," Plotkin admitted, "the only comment is that everything in the letter as far as Novel is concerned is actually the truth."

Plotkin said the purpose of the letter was to inform the person to whom the letter was addressed... of activities going on in Louisiana."

Garrison has charged Plotkin and other lawyers representing figures in the Kennedy inquiry are being paid by the CIA. Plotkin has denied the allegation.

THE LETTER draft, which a handwriting expert says was written by Novel, is a strange concoction of clipped phrases, cloak and dagger terminology and veiled references to "top secret" activities.

It begins:

"This letter is to inform you that District (Attorney) Jim Garrison has subpenned myself and an associate to testify before his Grand Jury on matters which may be classified TOP SECRET, Actions of individuals connected with DOUBLE-CHEK CORPORA- TION in Miami in the first quarter of 1961."

The attorney said Novel worked as what he termed "chief of security" for Garrison before "his forced departure from New Orleans."

But the lawyer declared his client actually was serving as a double agent in the employ of a "national news media."

The recent book, "The Invisible Government," which carries details of CIA operations, Identifies Double-Chek of Miami as a CIA front.

On page 79, the book declares that Double-Chek was the company through which pilots and other persons connected with anti-Castro Cuban operations were recruited.

"We have no current contact available to inform of this situation," the Novel letter draft continues. "So I took the liberty of writing you direct and appraising you of current situation, expecting you to forward this through appropriate channels."

Although the draft is undated, the sequence of events it relates places its writing sometime in late January or early February.

It tells of "avoiding" one Garrison subpena but says that attorneys have warned other subpenas are to follow.

"The Fifth Amendment and/or immunity (and) legal tactics will not suffice," the letter states.

The grand juries of Orleans and East Baton Rouge Parishes continued their twin probes of organized crime in Louisiana Thursday by calling a 'string' of prominent personalities to testify.

Included in the notable pa- rade were state police Supt. Thomas Burbank, Nassau County (New York) District Attorney William Cahn and former New Orleans bar op- erator James (Babin) Novel, who gained fame as the elusive witness in District Attorney Jim Garrison's presidential cor- ruption probe.

Novel testified before the East Baton Rouge Jurors, while Burbank and Cahn huddled with the Orleans jurors during a lengthy testifying session in the afternoon.

Prior to entering the grand Jury room, Burbank main- tained that to his knowledge there is no syndicated gambling.

into the capital city from Columbus, Ohio, under, immunity from arrest. In his possession was a tape recording which he said would make his testimony sensational.

WOULD TAKE TEST

Surrounded by lawyers, Novel refused to talk with news- men except to say that he would take a lie detector test to back his statements to the grand jury.

In a related happening Thursday in Austin, Tex., a hearing was set for Nov. 21 to decide whether Texas should extradite New Orleans contractor D'Alton Smith to face charges of offering a $25,000 bribe to Aubrey Young, a former aide to Gov. John J. McKeithen.

Young was mentioned in one of a series of articles in Life Magazine which asserted that organized crime was rampant in the state. The articles trig- gered the grand Jury Investiga- tions

In the Orleans probe, Asst. Dist. Atty. Charles Ray Ward denied Thursday that the gam- bling ring uncovered by the Nassau district attorney was still operating in New Orleans.

Ward said pressure from the local district attorney's office had caused the operation to move to a neighboring parish

REASON FOR SUBPENA

Ward emphasized that Bur- bank was subpenaed for ques- tioning to determine if any sig- nificant information has been gathered concerning New Or- leans in the state police investi- gation into organized crime.

He said the state police has been conducting an extensive investigation in the city during the past 10 days.

With New Orleans tough and throughout the state, strong doubt has been voiced by au- thorities over whether Novel actually has the "sensational" information he claims. Novel is said to have taped conversations in the governor's office after having been hired by Ellender to "de-bug" the governor's suite.

Labor Management Board of Inquiries came into the picture to question Novel at the suggestion of Baton Rouge Teamsters boss Edward G. Partin. The Board is investigating labor racketeering in the area.

The board's chief counsel, Camile Gravel, and its chief Investigator, A Harry Roberts, talked with Pitcher to see if an agreement could be worked out for a meeting with Novel Also present at the Konference were Novel's attorneys.

Failure of the board To Intef-view Novel, said Partin, would be continuing proof that the main endeavor has been to make me and Local 5 escape goats.

Gravel said he was uncertain whether he could subpena Novel because of the immunity grant-ed him.

There was an indication that Novel may also testify before the grand jury on Friday. According to Pitcher, Novel would remain under the immunity as lobg as he is in Louisiana for grand jury appearances:

LONG STATEMENT

Novel, presently under indictment by the Orleans Parish Grand Jury for conspiracy to commit burglary, once issued a lengthy statement saying that he knew of criminal influence and activity in Louisiana.

In his desire to have Novel returned to the state to testify, McKeithen gave Plicher $3,500 from his law enforcement fond to finance Novel's re-turn.

The only indictment handed down so far by the grand jury Ir Baton Rouge has been against Smith. The indictment charged that Smith committed public bribery by offering Young $25,000 to set up a meeting between Chimself and Partin, whose testimony was valuable in sending Teamsters head James R. Hoffa to prison.

In New Orleans, Ward said that the reported gambling ring funcovered by Calimas was not limited to the Crescent City.

"It is not limited to New Orleans and probably exists in every major city in the United States,” said Ward. “These lay-off bookie operations involve every city in the United States and several in Canada, where there is any betting on pro or college sports," he added.

HANDBOOK BETTING

Asked if handbook betting could be termed as organized crime, Ward replied "There is not one bit of evidence to indicate that this is part of is any

Cosa Nostra or Mafia network.

"As a matter of fact the evidence indicates that this is the typical layoff bookie operation, necessary where ever bets are made, in which small bookies who have received bets that are too large phone the bets to a larger operator,” Ward said.

Ward, who is presenting as district attorney in Garrison's absence, said that although no large-scale gambling operations are now operating in New Orleans, “this does not mean that you cannot make a bet on an athletic event in Orleans Parish and that this will not be called to a bookie by use of a telephone.

"You can make a bet in any city in the United States, including New Orleans, but the bookie themselves are not operating in Orleans Parish."

Because there is no evidence that key bookie operations now exist in Orleans Parish, Ward concluded, "I do not expect any immediate indictments to be issued by the grand Jury."

# Star Crime Witnesses Face Juries

Louisiana, Supt. of State Police Thomas Burbank has been subpehaed to appear before the Orleans Parish Grand Jury at 1 p.m. today.

The statewide probe into allegations of organized crime in Louisiana resumes today with a New York district attorney testifying here while long sought witness Gordon Novel appears before the Baton Rouge grand jury.

William Cahn, who said yesterday upon his arrival from Nassau County where he is a district attorney that New Orleans, plays a key role in a $100-million-a year gambling operation, is scheduled to take evidence before the grand jury here.

In Baton Rouge, meanwhile, the elusive Novel, who fled the state just ahead of a subpena from Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison, returned to Louisiana last night under a shield of immunity from arrest during his stay. He has promised con-

siderable information about crime in the state.

CAHN, who held a press conference in Garrison's office, said he had brought evidence with him concerning a sports betting syndicate touching New Orleans, Miami, Nassau County and other cities.

He said the syndicate does more than $100 million a year business in his jurisdiction alone. He said most of his information was obtained by wiretapping, which he called the most effective way of gaining information about illegal operations.

He said that his evidence concerns in part a college football coach who allegedly bet $20,000 on his own team. Although he refused to name the coach publicly, he said he might reveal the name of the coach to the grand jury.

IN BATON ROUGE, Novel talked for four hours last night with East Baton Rouge Parish Dist Atty Sargent Pitchre after his arrival from Columbus, Ohio where he has been living since selling his lounge and fleeing the state. Garrison had sought Novel in connection with his investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy.

The far-reaching probe into organized crime in the state was launched last month after Life magazine published articles saying that crime and corruption were flourishing in Louisiana

Dist. Atty. Sargent Pitcher said yesterday that the stage is set for the shrine bower’s return to Louisiana from Columbus, Ohio, where he sought sanctuary from New Orleans.

Dist. Atty. Jim Carraas, who subpoenaed him in connection with his information into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

NOVEL HAS been granted immunity from prosecution on his return to the state.

Yesterday, Pitcher and several members of the grand jury referred to a 25-minute interview with Novel which has been taped recorded by A Baton Rouge radio station. Glen D’Arcemout, the news director of WJBO, said the station filed on organized crime have subpoenaed by the grand jury.

Meanwhile, Gov. John J. McKeithen has signed a request for extradition of D’Alton Smith, a New Orleans contractor arrested in Texas. The grand jury indicted Smith on a charge of public bribery.

The indictment accuses Smith of offering $2,500 to Attorney Young, a former aide to McKeithen, to introduce him to the governor so a meeting between Smith and McKeithen could be arranged.

# Novel Appearance in Louisiana Is Agreed by Attorney-Pitcher

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - Attorney said Dist. Atty. Sargent Pitcher said Tuesday Gordon Novel's attorney agreed to his appearance before a grand jury probing influence on Louisiana government here.

Pitcher said attorney James Weidner, of Columbus, Ohio, had told him that the only thing remaining that could prevent Novel from coming here to testify was whether anything in his own docket would permit it.

"He will call me in the morning and let me know if we have a deal," Pitcher said.

Weidner, seeking a new set of documents assuring Novel of immunity from arrest even if Louisiana laws were to be had, notified the district attorney and the grand jury turns into a session Wednesday.

Novel is wanted for questioning in New Orleans Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's Kennedy assassination probe. He claimed he has sensational information for the grand jury here.

He found refuge in Columbus, Ohio, when the Orleans Parish grand jury subpoenaed him for him to testify about the Kennedy assassination.

The local district attorney prepared an earlier order formally seeking to return Novel here.

Novel demanded and received land aviation from prosecutors.

Pitcher advised the district attorney at Denton that he ex- pected extradition request pa- pers for Smith to be signed lat- er this week by Gov. John Mc- Kelithen.

SMITH INDICTED

Smith was indicted by the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in the probe into published claims that racketeers exercise influence over state govern- ment.

He was accused of offering Aubrey Young, former aide to McKeithen, $25,000 to influence him in his post, an offer which authorities said was part of an effort to buy freedom for for- mer Teamster Union President James Hoffa. The former Team- sters boss was imprisoned for jury tampering.

A man who said he was Smith turned himself in to authorities at Denton, and was released on $1,500 fugitive bond. His attor- neys have offered to produce him whenever a court hearing is set on his extradition.

Smith is the only person so far indicted by the grand jury, which has recessed its probe until Wednesday.

Young has said he received telephone calls from Carlos Mar- cello, New Orleans area rack- eteer figure, in McKeithen's of- fice.

He has said he arranged for Smith a meeting with Edward Grady Partin, local Teamster official who claims he was of- fered $1 million to change his statements Hoffa could be freed.

Young has said he once engaged Novel to install elec- tronic debugging equipment in

TRIP TAKEN

Pitcher has been working for more than a week to get Novel back here to testify. He took a trip to Chicago, and he has contacted Novel's attorney, sev- eral times to make arrange- ments that will satisfy Novel, the district attorney said.

Already, the district attorney has gotten letters from the gov- ernor, Garrison and other prose- cutors assuring that Novel will be allowed to tell what he knows to the grand jury here without being jailed on other charges.

Pitcher cited a reciprocal law effective in both Ohio and Loui- siana that guarantees immunity from arrest for such grand jury witnesses brought in from other states.

Still, this apparently was not enough to satisfy Novel by his attorney. He asked for sworn affidavits from all concerned.

Pitcher agreed to provide a "round robin" affidavit circulat- ing such an affidavit to McKelthen and the several district attorneys involved for signatures. He expects to hand it to Novel's attorney within the week.

Pitcher also made available to Novel the official parish air- plane for transportation back to East Baton Rouge Parish with- out being held down in any other jurisdiction along with personal guards from his office.

Nowel, wanted by Garrison and McKeithea in connection
with his statements concerning the John F. Kennedy assassina-then probe of Garrison, told Pitcher he would come back to Louisiana from Columbus, Ohio, if granted immunity from arrest regarding the JFK murder investigation.

Pitcher said Novel will have kasamanity, from arrest while ta Louksiana and freedom to return to Columbus, or wherever he wants to go. He sald the indsentty is limited to arrest en any other charges and does ant extend to anything kyolving his appearance.

Only one person has been indicted as result of the crime probes in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. That was D'Alton Smith, a former New Orleans electrical contractor who is accused of public bribery in offering $25,000. to Young to arrange a meeting.

He said there is no doubt that calls came from Carlos Marcello, " not to the governor's office, to the office next door."

Young has claimed he re-ceived two such telephone calls, but Life says as many as 60 may have been placed ea a particular telephone. The House speaker's office was next door to the governor's office at the time of the alleged calls.

Addressing the group before McKeitthen, Rarick charged that the public is being hoodwinked. We must think and act for surselves," be added.

"The federal government handcuffs our police officers. then accuses us of being the home base of the Costa Nostra," Rarick concluded.

District Attorney Jim Garrison Tuesday first had invited the governor to appear in New Orleans, then subpensed him.

Garrison, when asked why he issued the subpens, said, "Originally, I was following protocol and I then I decided this is no time for protocol. We want to find out what these allegations of organized crime are all about and, so far nobody seems to know except what they read in Life Magazine.

ETHICS UNIT TO PROBE

"We are going to call everybody we think can shed some light on this thing if we have to we'll call the ambassador to the United Nations."

2. According to the States-Item articles of 26 May 1967, the letter, linoleum which appeared to be a draft, had been found under a rug in an apartment occupied by NOVEL prior to his departure from New Orleans in about mid-March 1957, and had been turned over to the boyfriend of one of two girls who found it while cleaning the apartment. The boyfriend had turned it over to his professor at a New Orleans university who is a friend of Reporter Hoke MAY, and he delivered it to MAY. (NOVEL's attorney has stated that NOVEL worked for CIA in New Orleans in 1961).

3. Hoke MAY, without question, is Subject who in April 1958 was granted a Covert Security Approval for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly employed by FJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his position with a private firm which handled work for the Project.

# FOLLOWS DEVIOUS PATH

## Letter by Novel Adds to Mystery

A letter written by fugitive witness Gordon Novel added a new cloak-and-dagger twist today to the Kennedy assassination probe.

Attorney Steven Plotkin said Novel actually wrote the communication. Further, he said, his client was working for the Central Intelligence Agency here in 1961.

But Novel called the letter "a trap" set for Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison, who is attempting to bring Novel back to New Orleans for questioning.

WHATEVER THE authenticity of the document, the circumstances of its discovery read like a chapter in a whodone-it.

The letter came into the hands of States-Item reporter, Hoke May. This is how it happened:

The letter turned up when two girls were doing their spring housecleaning. It was well hidden in the fugitive witness's French Quarter apartment.

SO WELL HIDDEN, in fact, that a team of Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents and officers from Garrison's investigative squad missed it when they searched the rooms after Novel left town.

The girls, who rented the Novel apartment after his departure, found it during a thorough housecleaning and refurbishing session.

One of them turned it over to her boyfriend. Her turn showed it to his professor at a New Orleans university.

The professor is a friend of May's.

THE LETTER was addressed to a Mr. Weiss and probably was written in late January or early February to this year, judging by the time sequence it describes.

When a copy was sent to him, Plotkin reviewed its contents, spoke to his client and told the States-Item Novel had drafted the letter.

He said, "Everything in the letter as far as Novel is concerned is actually the truth."

The contents of the missive are compounded of cryptic references, code names and a plea for Weiss to get Novel "out of this mess" by an unspecified date in March of 1967.

THE LETTER appears to be a draft, which later might be recopied or typed. There is no indication it was ever mailed however, and Plotkin said he does not know whether the draft was sent to the addressee.

Presumably Weiss is connected with the CIA.

Novel departed New Orleans about mid-March after receiving a subpena to testify in Garrison's Kennedy death plot investigation. He went to McLean, Va., headquarters of the CIA.

HE WAS MET there by a former official of the Justice Department who now works for one of the radio-television networks.

The 29-year-old former bar owner took a lie detector test at McLean and ducked under cover for another few days, a time when he was reported to be in Montreal.

His next sappearance was at Gahanna, Ohio, a Columbus suburb where he was arrested April 1 on a warrant from Garrison who charged him with conspiracy to burglarize a munitions dump at Houma in 1961.

AN INDEPENDENT handwriting expert says the letter is in Novel's handwriting.

The expert, Gilbert Fortier of New Orleans, compared the penciled letter with other samples of Novel's writing and printing.

"It is my conclusion that the same person who wrote the handwriting specimens also wrote the draft to Mr. Weiss," Fortier asserted.

He said he checked especially for the possibility the letter might be a forgery but concluded it was not probable.

"It was written too easily and too freely to have been forged," Fortier said.

THE LETTER to Weiss begins:

"This letter is to inform you that, District (Attorney) Jim Garrison has subpenaed myself and an associate to testify before his Grand Jury on matters which may be classified TOP SECRET. Accusations of individuals connected with DOUBLE-CHEK CORPORATION in Miami in first quarter of 1961; otherwise, they are instructed to simultaneously release same for public scrutiny to different areas.

APPROPRIATE counteraction relative to Garrison's inquisition concerning us may best be handled through military channels vis (a) vis DIA man (Garrison is presently colonel in Louisiana's Army National Guard and has ready reserve status). Contact may be had through our attorneys of record, Plotkin, Alvarez, Sapir."

Plotkin confirmed that he has tapes and records held in

\"of Miami as a CIA front organization which recruited pilots and other Cuban personnel for the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.\"

WE HAVE NO current contact available to inform of this situation\" the letter continues. \"So I took the liberty of writing you direct and apprising you of current situations expecting you to forward this through appropriate channels.\"

Our connection and activity of that period involved individuals presently about to be indicted as conspirators in Mr. Garrison's investigation. We have temporarily avoided one subpena not to reveal Double-Chek activities or associate them with this thing before Thursday 3/7/67. Our attorneys have been told to expect another subpena to appear and testify on this matter. The Fifth Amendment and/or immunity (and) legal tactics will not suffice.\"

MR. GARRISON is in possession of unsworn portions of this testimony. He is unaware of Double Chek's involvement in this matter but has strong suspicions. I have been questioned extensively by local FBI recently as to whether or not I was involved with Double Chek's parent holding corporation during the time. My reply on five queries was negative.\"

Bureau unaware of Double Chek association in this matter. Our attorneys and others are in possession of complete sealed files containing all information concerning matters \"In event of our sudden departure, either accidental or otherwise, they are instructed.

# DA Seeking Copies of 'CIA' Letter by Novel

Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison today asked for copies of a letter purportedly directed to the Central Intelligence Agency by fugitive witness Gordon Novel.

The letter, which Novel's lawyer said was written by his client, came into the possession of the States-Item was reported to have been found in Novel's former apartment in the French Quarter. It apparently was written before Novel's departure from New Orleans after he was subpenaed to testify in Garrison's Kennedy death plot investigation.

# Novel Admitted Bunker Theft, Rhodes Is Told

Continued from Page 1

New Orleans to Houma at night in a Lincoln automobile owned and driven by Gordon Novel and in a panel truck.

"AFTER ARRIVING at the site of the bunker, which was leased by Schlumberger Well Services Cory, the defendant, Gordon Novel, Sergio Arcacha-Smith, David W. Ferrie, and others, unnamed, unlawfully entered it by cutting the lock with a pair of bolt cutters which had been brought along for the purpose:

"After entry into the bunker (they) took various forms of explosives and munitions. Thereafter they returned to the city of New Orleans with the stolen munitions."

An affidavit filed with new extradition papers sent to Columbus, Ohio, claims that Gordon Novel admitted his part in a burglary of a munitions bunker in Houma in 1961.

The new extradition papers were sent to Ohio Gov. James Rhodes as part of Orleans Parish Dist. Attorney Jim Garrison's efforts to bring Novel back to Louisiana on a burglary conspiracy charge, Garrison wants Novel in connection with his Investigation of President Kennedy's assassination:

James Alcock an assistant district attorney, said in the affidavit:

"The said Gordon Novel responded to questioning by Jim Garrison, district attorney for the Parish of Orleans, and William Gurvich Investigative aide to Jim Garrison, that he and the parties named here, in did in fact commit the conspiracy and burglary outlined above."

"In the body of the affidavit, Alcock declared that Novel, Sergio Arcacha Smith, David W. Ferrie and other unnamed persons did conspire, agree, and combine to burglarize a munitions bunker located in Houma, La."

He said, the conspiracy was entered into in New Orleans at the home of Arcacha.

Alcock said that the men went to Houma on or about Aug. 21, 1961.

"The trip was made from (Turn to Page 4, Column 5) VEL GORDON

The extradition papers also included a photograph of Novel identified by a former girl friend, Marlene Mancy, 42 Oaklawn dr., Metairie, who had dated Novel in 1961.

THE DOCUMENTS also contain a copy of the simple burglary charge leveled against Novel and Arcacha by the sheriff of Terrebonne Parish. The affidavit was signed by Capt. Bert Boyne.

Meanwhile, the DA's office said a new figure in the investigation scheduled for questioning today was interviewed last night by a Garrison aide.

A DA's office spokesman declined to say what questions were asked or what information was obtained from the man.

He is Juan M. Valdes a self-described Latin playwright who figured in one of the city's more sensational murders. A subpena was issued for him yesterday. Valdes in the summer of 1964 discovered the mutilated body of Dr. Mary Stults Sherman, a women physician who occupied the same St. Charles ave. apartment building where the summoned witness lives.

HE WAS investigating smoke coming from the Sherman apartment when he stumbled onto the body. Dr, Sherman's killer, who has never been found, tried to burn the body,

Garrison would not comment on what questions will be asked Valdes

Another Latin, 30-year-old Carlos Quiroga spent two hours and ten minutes before the grand jury yesterday and emerged without comment.

QUIROGA, a Cuban exile, was once a close friend and associate of a fugitive witness from the Garrison inquiry, 44-year-old Sergio Arcacha Smith.

# Lane Stalks Out of Parley With Novel

COLUMBUS Ohio (AP) - Author Mark Lane and Gordon Novel, figures in controversies surrounding the death of President John F. Kennedy, had harsh words for each other after Lane stalked out of a meeting he had sought to discuss the New Orleans assassination probe.

Lane, author of "Rush to Judgment," first book challenging the validity of the Warren Commission report, yesterday met privately with Novel, wanted in New Orleans as a material witness in Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's Investigation.

Novel's Columbus attorney, Jerry Weiner, said the meeting, arranged at Lane's request, involved mostly questioning of his client by the author. When Novel started to question Lane, Weiner said, the author refused to answer.

Both men talked freely with reporters afterward.

Novel, a former New Orleans night club operator, branded Lane a "publicity man for Jim Garrison" and asserted he is "doing propaganda work for the district attorney."

Lane charged that a sodium amytal (truth serum) test given Novel in Columbus a few weeks ago was "rigged." Lane said Novel "hedged on questions" he answered during the test and that he wasn't telling very

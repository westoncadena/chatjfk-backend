30 April 1969
DCS Case 52872

1. Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Hugh C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source, informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with his visiting Washington. First, he does not plan on going to Washington himself; a representative from the Chicago Office is going for the purpose of meeting with the Financial Group Company. Next, McDonald said he has not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System. Finally, he does not plan a "world tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting bankers and government security people in various Latin American countries. He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries. Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries. His purpose in making these trips is to sell Hughes helicopters to foreign police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security system to banking institutions.

2. McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are firmed up.

3. McDonald is willing to go to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9 May and meet with TSD/ORD people there to "discuss" his Voice Ident System, but he is not prepared to do so unless TSD/ORD have some specific problems which his system will help solve. He feels otherwise it would be a waste of time.

4. The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69. It was decided that since ORD (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald previously that Carrick discuss the possible meeting on the Voice Ident System directly with McDonald.

5. McDonald was informed 29 April to expect a call from Carrick; that DCS/LAFO would follow up later concerning his travels abroad.

28 April - Tony Lohmane says that Mc Donald will come to D.C. if the agency has come real and honest problems to divines. He does not have the time to come to Washington for a general discussion on the subject.

Cal. West has canvassed one part of TSD and several people are interested in sitting in but the interest is not sufficient to justify bringing Mc Donald to Washington. Col West approached his D&E people and was told that Joe Terek had asked them some time ago and he had already arranged a meeting.

4/29/6940 (Circa 213-393-3564.) Talked to Tony about him - We wash this one out. Terek will make his own arrangement to (bring or not to bring) McDonald to D.C. To many millions spoil the sausage.

Subject: World Associates (Hugh McDonald, Proprietor)

1.  On 13 January 1970, at the request of McDonald, I met with him for lunch. He went into the same routine about his Organization anticipating spreading throughout the world in various countries in connection with bank security work. Queried specifically on this security domination, he informed me that he hoped to work with the Bank of America of Rochester, New York, in setting up security matters and losses in foreign countries. In connection with this, he said that he was planning to put low enforcement officers in various countries who would have access to government files and who would, in turn, set in liaison for him with bank credit cards, or merchants, in various countries. Eventually, he said that if a credit card was stolen and used, and once his organization completely found his law enforcement notification, he would notify all merchants, receiving stolen credit cards, in the city to be on the alert and not charge any items to such cards.

2.  The trend of the conversation was that McDonald was again seeking some assistance in setting up his organization. I asked him whether or not he was off the ground as yet and he said he had not, but that he was planning a trip to Europe sometime in February 1970 during which he hoped to sign up low enforcement officers in Europe in several strategic cities to work for him. He anticipates that he will put these people on a monthly retainer. He feels he will have a real intelligence function going in different countries that will provide economic, financial, and other types of information. Obviously, McDonald has not yet had any firm arrangements with the Bank of America or Inter-Bank.

3.  I told McDonald that I had previously forwarded information concerning his plans to my headquarters and that the reply I had received was that, inasmuch as his organization had low enforcement implications that it would be of no interest to the Agency. McDonald then switched the conversation noticeably but said that he was merely interested in informing us of the existence of his organization abroad. On this basis, I said that I would be glad to make a record of the conversation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

4. After meeting with McDonald on two occasions now I have come to the conclusion that he has some grandiose plans but has nothing to back them up.

Memorandum

TO : Director, DCS
ATTN : OSS (Walker)
FROM : Chief, Los Angeles Office
DATE: LA 416-70
15 May 70
SUBJECT: Case 52722

1. John Purfey passed the attached to me on Saturday, 9 May. FYI I would like to comment as follows.

2. (Item 1) It was Herbert White, not Beske, who reported on the new radical group at Pitzer, source Linda Knolles. We doubt that we can obtain much more in response to CI/SO questions. We will try, but with caution, since we are dealing with a young, obvious liberal female. As for Tom Clark, we think he is back at Cornell. Our report to you covered all we know to date.

3. (Item 2) R. D. Beske will try and determine what he can about Dr. and Mrs. Leo Kuper at UCLA. If everything appears favorable and we can clear we may contact. However, they are unknown to us. Ask CI/50 what they can tell us about them. It will help.

4. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) These people unknown to us. Who are they? Where did Furfey get their names? What does he know about them? What does he want us to do about them?

5. (Item 7) As I have reported, I will not personally contact John Cole. The FBI regards him as unsuitable to help them and, based upon their assessment, I will not serve any requirements on him. (Sorry my memo on this had an incomplete sentence.)

6. (Item 8) Answer is "no".

7. (Item 9) I have contacted Reid and reported.

8. (Item 10) Joseph Charles' PHS sent in 14 May.

9. (Item 11) I have told Purfey that Hugh McDonald is an opinionated, egotistical ass who refuses to provide any data to support his statements, thereby making it impossible to assess the information he supplies.

10. (Item 12) Beske says the chance of Baum providing anything is questionable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

SUBJECT: Case 52722 LA 416-70

11. (Item 13) I have finally figured out Purfey's West Pointer. During one of our initial conversations I facetiously remarked, in response to types he was looking for, that what he wanted was a red, white and blue Negro, a graduate of West Point, who is now in the export-import business dealing with Africa.

12. (Item 14) I told Purfey on Saturday that the local Os people are and have been in contact with the LAPD and the Sheriff's Office on militant matters; that the OS people are known as Agency: that 00 is reporting whatever they learn and for us to involve our- selves would be corfusing and duplicative. If Furfey wants to know what OS is getting, tell him to contact Ralph True in Headquarters/OS. Purfey might want to consider having his requirements levied on Os.

13. (Item 15) Beske reports nothing new, and not likely to ba anything soon on the Connover-Clarke affair. Connover has changed jobs and is too busy to do much.

14. (Item 16) Beske reports Gonzales may have something on V.B. but he doubts it. He will check.

15. (Item 17) I told Furfey that I do not want to get in- volved in any activity that would put us in the position of being accused of investigating militants. we are on thin ice as it is. Therefore, Devanon will not be asked to follow up on "Compton" contects and we will depend on OS police contacts.

10 September 1969

DCS Case 53199

1.  On 4 September 1969, Chief, LAFO, met with Hugh C. McDonald, President of World Associates Inc. A former law enforcement officer (Chief of Detectives, Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office, retired) he has an excellent reputation among law enforcement agencies. He has cooperated with the Agency fully in the past. He is a cleared source of LAFO/DCS.

2.  Since his retirement McDonald has started World Associates Inc., a company with two divisions, the Security Division and the Aircraft Division.

3.  The Security Division provides, as its primary service, a bank security system, designed to provide banking institutions with a means to control and curtail losses from fraud and robbery.

4.  The Aircraft Division was set up because of the exclusive contract World Associates has with the Hughes Tool Company (Hugnes Aircraft) for the sale of helicopters to law enforcement agencies, to operate a helicopter pilot training school for municipal and other law enforcement agencies and to handle the installation of helicopter patrol systems. This contract applies to all countries except the US. McDonald said he expects to sell the Hughes Model 300 helicopter to foreign law enforcement agencies. None of these has been sold abroad, with the exception of the Philippines. He will have to open up offices in order to demonstrate, sell and arrange for servicing of the helicopters. A helicopter pilot-salesman and a technical representative would be needed at a beginning cost of about $18,000 per year. McDonald said he would have a good, plausible reason for setting up such an office in Hong Kong, not only to sell and service police helicopters in the Crown Colony, but alsc to use as a base for other Asian country activities. McDonald expects to start exploring the foreign police potential for helicopters in the near future, beginning with a trip to South America.

5.  The possibility of using foreign offices to promote the activities of the Security Division of the company also exists.

6.  Currently, McDonald is in Hawaif and is exploring the possibility of setting up a police intelligence school in Hawaii to train police officers from Asian countries.

7.  Attached are copies of data pertaining to prospectus, products, services, etc..

8.  In the event Cover Division has any interest in this matter, Chief, LAFO, will be glad to discuss it further at Headquarters during week of 5-11 October 1969.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with Mr. Hugh C. McDonald, President of World Associates Inc.

Albi88

12149859

1. In response to a request from Air. Killgore, on the staff of Senator Barry Goldwater (k., Ariz.), I met with Mr. Hugh C. McDonald at the Madison Hotel this afternoon, McDonald explained that he is in the banking and security business, having previously worked in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. He also said he had a contractual relationship with the Agency some years ago and served as chief of cecurity for Senator Goldwater during his campaign for the presidency in 1953.

2. Mr. McDonald talked this morning with Senator Coldwater about his laterest in meeting with someone from the Agency to discuse a report which he has prepared on the subject of highly sensitive Soviet bacteriological warfare activitics on the island of Vozrozhdeniya in the Aral Sea. McDonald said he originally became aware of the existence of the secret Soviet activity in this locality while in Europe on a business trip. He decided to follow it up and was referred from one contact to another until he was virtually at the Russian border and decided he had Investigated the matter as far as he felt he could without the possibility of personal risk. McDonald pointed out that the information in his report was obtained from sources who spoke freely to him without any remunera - tion whatsoever. He added that he understood from some of his sources that they had been in touch with the Agency or with U.S. Intelligence representatives and had become reluctant to deal further with these representatives because they were not treated properly by them and the sources feared the Agency had been penetrated by Soviet agents.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

3. The reasons for McDonald's contact with us are threefold;

a. After preparing the 65-page report (a copy of which he gave me) he became concerned that publication of this document might not be in the national interest. He is anxious for our advice on this.

b. He is interested in knowing whether the information is reasonably accurate. He quite naturally does not want to publish a story that contains errors.

c. He is interested in knowing whether the Agency wants to delve further into this matter.

4. With regard to the possible publication of the report, McDonald said he planned to talk in very general terms this afternoon with representatives of *Time/Life*. He will make no commitments to them and will treat his meeting as strictly exploratory. It is McDonald's opinion that the story would appeal to publishers and would bring approximately $200,000 to $300,000.

5. Mr. McDonald claims he has no real interest in pursuing this subject further unless the Agency feels there is real merit in it. He said his sources are "wide open" and he is confident that further information could be developed although he has no direct contact with them as individuals and would probably have to go through the same laborious process of contacting one person through another as he did before.

6. McDonald plans to leave Washington tomorrow, but said he could stay in town through Friday if this was necessary. He said he came here for the express purpose of discussing this report with us. He said he did not consider Senator Goldwater a personal friend, but indicated he had traveled thousands of miles with the Senator during his presidential campaign and although he argued with him on many subjects had a very high regard for him. It was agreed that I would get the report in the hands of the appropriate Agency people as soon as possible and attempt to give him a preliminary reaction some time tomorrow.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

SECRET

7. The report has been forwarded to Dr. Karl Weber, of OSI, for review. A check with the Domestic Contact Service Hsclosed that McDonald had been a contact of the California Fleid Office and, although considored by DCS to be somewhat of a phony and a nuisance, his clearances wore verified by them. McDonald does not appear to me to be a crackpot although I have not read his report. He gave no indication at this meeting of making a "pitch." He appeared concerned about the Information he has uncovered and seems to want to do what is right under the circumstances. Mr. Killgore, in Senator Goldwater's office, has asked that we give him a followup report on our contact with McDonald.

Hugh McDonald telephoned and informed that, "a reliable source" told him that a sum of "several million" dollars had been transferred to the Cathay Bank (Los Angeles) from the Far East for the Commercial Bank of Sweden. He commented that it may be the first substantial payment to militant groups throughout the world from the Red Chinese. The information was about 10-12 days old as of 13 April 1970, he informed me. Because of his refusal to provide any data concerning his sources in the past, I merely thanked him for the information.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Subject: World Associates, Inc. (Hugh McDonald)

1. McDonald asked me to meet with him on 24 Mar 70. I did. He started the conversation by stating, "We are getting bigger all the time and are on the way of becoming the largest, private intelligence organization in the world. And we are picking up intelligence that I want to pass to someone, anyone in government. I feel you should get it."

2. At this point I commented that I appreciated his feeling but wondered if he could provide some basis for information passed to us that would permit some evaluation, such as type of person who provided him the information, when, where and his evaluation of his source. McDonald "blew his cool". He said if he did so, we would figure out who his source was and contact the source directly and push the source around to get what we wanted. I told McDonald we did not push people around; that I had personally heard the Director comment years ago that he would not permit any pressure on anyone, anytime, anywhere. McDonald replied, "Then he has changed. I know that people have been pushed around by CIA". I asked who, when and where. He replied it happened after WWII in "1947, 48 or 50 in connection with the Katyn Massacre investigation". I told him that to the best of my knowledge we had nothing to do with the Katyn inquiries; that it was a Congressional Commission that looked into the matter.

3. I asked McDonald if he felt he could not trust us then why bother to pass along information to us. He said that he wants the government to have the information that he feels is important; that he trusts me to pass it along; that he keeps a record of what he passes to us in the event it is ever said he had information and failed to pass it along.

4. McDonald then proceeded to tell me that "new, short, fat missiles" have been shipped into Cuba; that they are so-called defensive missiles but are a type that can take a "multi-head offensive warhead". The shipment to Cuba from the USSR took place three-four months ago. These new type missiles can reach targets in the US.

5. Next, McDonald said that there are two sets of people involved in the current bombings of banks, offices, etc. One is a racial group made up of black militants and the other a group of white US and Canadian trained "sappers" who aim at disrupting everything. He stated that he

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

SECRET

has a list of large companies to be targeted in this area (probably the All Points Bulletin I received 10 days ago which listed four companies).

6. Again, McDonald said he would not reveal his sources or anything about them that would enable us to identify them.

7. McDonald went on to say, "We are spending a lot of money on a lot of campuses to obtain intelligence." When asked for some details he backed off and said they were just starting and had to be careful how touch they spent.

8. A little later on he spoke of talking to a 20 year old senior who had been in his office and the attitude expressed by this student about young people and the establishment (this could be one of his impeccable sources of information).

9. McDonald then said his organization had gathered together soms "very interesting statistics ou studeat protests." He said there are 25 million college students; one-quarter of these are freshmen who do not involve themselves; one-half of the 25 million are sophomores and juniors. These are the real source of trouble. The seniors are concerned about graduction and a job and inclined to forget protests and lcea towards the establishment as of now. However, as time passes and students are promoted by the time they will become students they will remember being part of a protest, their pictures being on file end will feel they will never get a job and will, therefore, become part of the permanent anti-establishment group. (These "statistics" vere not supported by any written reports or other data.)

10. During the conversation McDonald said that, "Nixon personally seat 20 Washington people out to me to consult with us on a program." Further remarks revealed that the Washington, DC police department was contacted by one of McDonald's people in an attempt to sell a helicopter- police patrol training program.

11. Obviously, McDonald is overly impressed with himself; is prone to a high degree of exaggeration and truth-stretching; is not inclined to cooperate fully and one should be careful not to be taken in by him.

He said he has learned from "an impeccable source" that, "by August 1970 the USSR will hit China." Also, that the Soviets have solved the problems they have been having with their MIRV system.

2.  McDonald refused to provide any information concerning the qualifications of his source to provide reliable data. In fact, he became a bit vexed when the matter was brought up.

3.  I regard McDonald as a prima donna, an opportunist and one inclined to exaggerate. However, I pass the above along for the record.

4-61-88

23 January 1970

Subject: World Associates (Hugh McDonald, Proprietor)

1. On 13 January 1970, at the request of McDonald, I met with him for lunch. He went into the same routine about his organization anticipating spreading throughout the world in various countries in connection with bank security work. Queried specifically on this security designation, he informed me that he hoped to work with the Bank of America and Inter-Bank of Rochester, New York, in setting up security measures that would prevent credit card losses in foreign countries. In arranging to do this, he said that he was planning to put law enforcement officers on the payroll in various countries who would have access to government information and who would, in turn, act in liaison for him with banks that might be honoring such credit cards, or merchants, in various cities in the country. Basically, he said that if a credit card is stolen or fraudulently issued and used, and once his organization is notified through his law enforcement employees, he would notify all the banks, hotels, etc., in the city to be on the alert and not charge anything to such card.

2. The trend of the conversation indicated that McDonald was again seeking some assistance from the Agency in setting up his organization. I asked him whether or not he had gotten it off the ground as yet and he said he had not, but that he was planning a trip to Europe sometime in February 1970 during which he hoped to sign up law enforcement officers in different cities to work for him. He anticipates that he will pay these people on a monthly retainer. He feels he will have a real intelligence organization going in different countries that will provide economic, political, and other types of information. Obviously, McDonald has not yet made any firm arrangements with the Bank of America or Inter-Bank.

3. I told McDonald that I had previously forwarded information concerning his plans to my headquarters and that the reply I had received was that inasmuch as his organization had law enforcement affiliations that it would be of no interest to the Agency. McDonald then switched the conversation completely and said that he was merely interested in informing us of the existence of his organization abroad. On this basis, I said that I would be glad to make a record of the conversation.

4. After meeting with McDonald on two occasions now I have come to the conclusion that he has come grandiose plans but has nothing to back them up.

Case 53,199 Cover Possibilities in Hong Kong and Japan

15 October 1963

1.  The leads which you have forwarded in response to this case have been very much appreciated by Cover Staff. The following comments have been received concerning several of these leads:

a. MLA-00-A(S)-322/263555 and IL-716-65 and S- Cover Staff has received preliminary security regarding facts and security has again brought us the derogatory information which you have on file. To get full CSA on Dims to override this former report would require extensive field investigation. Taylor does not feel that he wants to subject Mr. Binns to this type investigation so Cover will not pursue this lead.

b. "MLA-00-A(S)-322/26333-55 - World Larceny Law enforcement" Because Mr. Hugh C. McDonald's former law enforcement career and his continuing involvement in that field, this lead will not be pursued.

c. MLA-00-A(S)-322/26354-59 - Duran Kimble - Cover Staff would be interested in pursuing this lead if we could pinpoint fewer committing officials for Cover's specific interest. A Cover commitment within an organization is on a "need-to-know" basis, to those officials who would be directly concerned in backstopping the commitment. Would you please review this organization and if the committing officials can be limited please identify them and provide biographic data if we do not have the biographic data available in Headquarters files.

d. Memo For The Record, 12 September 1962 - Hartman Sports Clothes. This lead is very interesting and Cover Staff is processing clearance.

e. LA-752-59 Mr. Harold Hutton, Refining Associates (Canada) Ltd. This lead forwarded to Cover Staff in response to a different requirement (case not open to your office). It was decided that Mr. Hutton would not fit the Cover requirement so this lead has been forwarded to the area desk for consideration.

DCS Case 53199

SUBJECT: Cover Potential of
World Associates, Inc.

1. On 4 September 1969, Chief, LAFO, met with Hugh C. McDonald, President of World Associates Inc. A former law enforcement officer (Chief of Detectives, Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office, retired) he has an excellent reputation among law enforcement agencies. He has cooperated with the Agency fully in the past. He is a cleared source of LAFO/DCS.

2. Since his retirement McDonald has started World Associates Inc., a company with two divisions, the Security Division and the Aircraft Division.

3. The Security Division provides, as its primary service, a bank security system, designed to provide banking institutions with a means to control and curtail losses from fraud and robbery.

4. The Aircraft Division was set up because of the exclusive contract World Associates has with the Hughes Tool Company (Hughes Aircraft) for the sale of helicopters to law enforcement agencies, to operate a helicopter pilot training school for municipal and other law enforcement agencies and to handle the installation of helicopter patrol systems. This contract applics to all countries except the US. McDonald said he expects to sell the Hughes Model 300 helicopter to foreign law enforcement agencies. None of these has been cold abroad, with the exception of the Philippines. No will have to open up offices in order to demonstrate, call and arrange for servicing of the helicopters. A helicopter pilot-salesman and a technical representative would be needed at a beginning cost of about $19,000 per year. McDonald said he would have a good, plausible reason for setting up such an office in Hong Kong, not only to sell and service police helicopters in the Crown Colony, but also to use sa o base for other Asian country activities. McDonald expecte to stert exploring the foreign police potential for holicopters in the near future, beginning with a trip to South America.

SUBJECT: World Associates, Inc.
Hugh C. McDonald, President
406 Wilshire Boulevard
Suite 203
Santa Monica, Calif. 90401

MLA 00-A(S) 322/12039-69
30 April 1969
DCS Case 52872

1. Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Hugh C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source, informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with his visiting Washington. First, he does not plan on going to Washington himself; a representative from the Chicago Office is going for the purpose of meeting with the Financial Group Company. Next, McDonald said he has not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System. Finally, he does not plan a "world tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting bankers and government security people in various Latin American countries. He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries. Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries. His purpose in making these trips is to sell Hughes helicopters to foreign police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security System to banking institutions.

2. McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are firmed up.

3. McDonald is willing to go to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9 May and meet with TSD/ORD people there to "discuss" his Voice Ident System, but he is not prepared to do so unless TSD/ORD have some specific problems which his system will help solve. He feels otherwise it would be a waste of time.

4. The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69. It was decided that since ORD (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald previously that Carrick discuss the possible meeting on the Voice Ident System directly with McDonald.

5. McDonald was informed 29 April to expect a call from Carrick, that DCS/LAFO Would follow up later concerning his travels abroad.

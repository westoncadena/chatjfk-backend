Re: Assassination Records Review Board Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

Dear John:

We would once again appreciate your assistance in obtaining access to CIA records of possible pertinence to the John F. Kennedy assassination. We request that you locate CIA or Intelligence Community serial publications for the dates immediately before and after the assassination (November 20-30, 1963), including such publications as the President's Daily Brief, the President's Checklist, or any serial publications related specifically to Cuba or the Soviet Union. In addition to intelligence reports, we also request that a search be undertaken for any analytical materials bearing upon the assassination.

As with our previous requests, we would be pleased to discuss with you ways in which we might better refine this request.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Re: The Central Intelligence Agency's Compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107

Dear Mr. Deutch:

Since 1994, the Assassination Records Review Board ("Review Board") has been working with a number of Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, to locate and publicly release records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. These actions have been taken pursuant to The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) ("JFK Act"). We have been working with Mr. John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group and Mr. Barry Harrelson, Senior Review Officer, Historical Review Group of CIA and have appreciated the cooperation we have received.

The purpose of this letter is to request your agency's cooperation in assisting the Review Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American people that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplished to the greatest reasonable extent. We want to assure the American people that the United States Government has identified, located, and released all records relating to the assassination of President Kennedy. Indeed, one of the paramount purposes of the JFK Act is to certify to the public that the United States Government is not withholding relevant materials related to the assassination. See, e.g., *Assassination Materials Disclosure Act*, H. R. Rep. No. 102-625, Part 1, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. (1992) ("The Federal Government's failure to release official materials has contributed to numerous conspiracy theories and fueled charges of government complicity in the assassination...a salutary purpose is served in opening these files [relating to the JFK assassination ] to allay the suspicion of government cover-up.").

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: David G. Marwell

The Honorable John M. Deutch

The Review Board has recently considered how it, along with the relevant federal agencies, can best demonstrate to the American public that a thorough, good faith, and diligent effort has been made to locate and release all remaining assassination-related records within the control of the United States Government (and that the Government is not hiding any such materials from public disclosure). Pursuant to the Congressional mandate under the JFK Act to "create an enforceable, independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of such records," 44 U.S.C. § 2107(2)(a)(3), the Review Board seeks to have the relevant federal agencies provide a complete and specific accounting of their efforts to locate and release assassination-related records, including a full explanation for any destruction of such records.

Accordingly, the Review Board requests that each relevant agency adhere to the formal compliance program (hereinafter "JFK Act Compliance Program") outlined below and devised by the Review Board pursuant to its powers under Section 7(j)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), and (F) of the JFK Act. We hereby request that you undertake the following measures by the dates provided (these dates were set in view of the fact that the Review Board's operations currently are scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997):

1.  Designation of Agency Compliance Official (or officials) and statement of intent to comply with the JFK Act. We request that by December 9, 1996, your agency designate an Agency Compliance Official who ultimately will be responsible for ensuring that the agency has complied with its obligations under the JFK Act, including the identification, location, and organization of assassination records and the transmission of those records to the National Archives and Records Administration ("National Archives"). Although the Review Board assumes that Mr. John Pereira or Mr. Barry Harrelson will serve in this position, we nevertheless await your formal confirmation. If necessary, your agency may designate additional persons with knowledge of the measures that have been undertaken to locate assassination records.

We also request that by December 9, 1996, the agency convey its agreement to adhere to the compliance procedures outlined in this letter. To the extent that any compliance procedure described below appears to be unreasonable or to present difficulties that we may not have anticipated, please explain why and make alternate suggestions to us.

2.  Initial Statement of Compliance. We request that the Agency Compliance Official prepare, by January 6, 1997, an initial written statement of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 4

The Honorable John M. Deutch
November 27, 1996
Page 3

agency's compliance with the JFK Act ("Statement of Compliance"), setting forth the steps that the agency has taken to locate and process assassination records. The Review Board recognizes that many of the relevant federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have previously written letters to the Review Board apprising it of their progress at various stages of identifying and processing assassination records under the JFK Act. The Statement of Compliance, while it may include information previously reported to the Board, is to be the agency's comprehensive and final report to the American public of what it has done to locate records relating to the assassination. This Statement of Compliance shall include, to the fullest reasonable extent, the following information:

a. A complete description of all steps that your agency took to identify and locate assassination records including, but not limited to, an identification of the major record collections and files that were consulted in the agency's search, any departmental file indices consulted, the names and titles of the persons who were responsible for conducting the searches, the physical locations of the records that were searched, the off-site storage facilities (e.g., Federal Records Centers) searched, the specific steps that were taken to locate and retrieve materials in archives, and any other criteria used by the agency to locate assassination records.

b. A description of the steps that the agency took in direct response to specific requests of the Review Board to locate certain additional records or information relating to the assassination. In particular, we ask that the CIA describe what specific steps it has taken to address the following requests: CIA-9, Publications and Analytical Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated March 6, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); CIA-11, Silvia Duran's Original Statement (See David G. Marwell letter dated May 3, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); CIA-12, JMWAVE Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated May 22, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); for HTLINGUAL records (See T. Jeremy Gunn Memorandum dated October 1, 1996 to Mr. Barry Harrelson); and for Monthly Operational Reports on Cuban Exile Groups (See Manuel E. Legaspi Memorandum dated October 17, 1996 to Mr. Barry Harrelson).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 5

The Honorable John M. Deutch
November 27, 1996
Page 4

c. To the extent that any assassination-related records have been destroyed by the agency or any agency official, a full and specific explanation of the circumstances surrounding the destruction of such records.

d. The status of remaining work that you can now identify that needs to be completed by your agency in order to comply fully with the JFK Act, including an identification of the categories of records that must be processed and transmitted to the National Archives, a description of any additional searches for files that must be done, and the projected date(s) for completion of these tasks.

3. Review Board Interview With Agency Compliance Official (or Officials).
   Shortly after the submission of the agency's written Statement of Compliance, we ask that the Agency Compliance Official (as well as any persons who helped prepare the agency's initial Statement of Compliance) be made available to the Review Board for an interview regarding the location of agency assassination records. The interview will be used as an opportunity to resolve any outstanding questions regarding the agency's search, including any follow-up tasks to be completed by the agency. The Review Board anticipates that these interviews will be conducted in January 1997.

4. Submission of Final Agency Declaration of Compliance. By July 1, 1997, Federal agencies are expected to complete the process of identification, location, and declassification of its assassination records at which time they should submit to the Review Board a final declaration certifying, under oath, their compliance with the provisions of the JFK Act (the "Final Declaration of Compliance"). Because of the volume of CIA records, such a "final" statement may not be practicable at that time. However, we do expect that CIA will provide a complete status appraisal by July 1, 1997. This final declaration shall set forth all of the information initially set forth in the initial Statement of Compliance and shall also supplement the initial Statement of Compliance by detailing any further steps that were conducted by the agency in identifying and locating assassination records. The agencies' Final Declarations of Compliance will be included in our final report to Congress.

5. Compliance Depositions. Starting on or about August 1, 1997, the Review Board, pursuant to its statutory authority, may conduct depositions, under oath, of the Agency Compliance Official along with any other agency officials with responsibility for complying with the JFK Act. The decision to take a compliance deposition of an agency will be made on a case by case basis, taking into account the importance of the agency to the work of the JFK Act and the sufficiency of the agency's efforts to account fully for its compliance with the JFK Act. In the event that the Review Board decides to commence a compliance deposition of an agency, the responsible agency designee(s) will be expected to testify under oath with respect to any and all issues relating to the agency's record search, including the scope of the search, the identity of files searched, the destruction of any relevant records, and any other matters set forth in the Final Declaration of Compliance. Any person obligated to appear for a deposition under oath shall be fully entitled to obtain legal representation.

We look forward to receiving your initial response, by December 9, that designates your Agency Compliance Official and includes your statement regarding your position with respect to the provisions outlined in this letter. To the extent that you have any questions or suggestions regarding the Compliance Program, please do not hesitate to contact our General Counsel, T. Jeremy Gunn, at (202) 724-0088.

Thank you for your cooperation with our work.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: ARRB Request No. CIA-9

REFERENCE: "Compliance Letter" to DCI, fr. ARRB
ExDir, dtd. 27 Nov 1996, (attached)

1.  The attached request was received from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) in March 1996. It appears from our records that a copy was not sent to you. (Our normal procedure is to provide the appropriate Directorate Focal Point a copy of the request as soon as received.) This is one of several requests placed on hold while we worked on other ARRB priorities.

2.  In the Agency's response to the 27 November "Compliance" letter (see reference), we asked the ARRB to prioritize their requests. The ARRB staff has identified CIA-9 as a "priority" request.

3.  The initial request is for access not release. We usually limit access to sensitive material to Jeremy Gunn, ARRB General Counsel, and one or two of his staff. If the material is particularly sensitive, access is restricted to Mr. Gunn and/or the Executive Director of the Board, Mr. David Marwell. Gunn, Marwell and all members of the ARRB Staff's CIA team are fully cleared (TS/SCI).

4.  HRG reviewer Jim Hanrahan (31809) is the focal point for this request. Many of the documents described in CIA-9 were part of eight Executive Order Mandatory Review requests (see attachments) from 1994 and 1995. Jim has obtained from IP&CRD full-text copies of the documents. He will be in touch with you concerning access to these specific documents.

5.  Mr. Gunn will be at IP the week of February 24 to review documents. Please advise HRG as soon as possible of

DI/IRO

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Review Board Request

1.  On 11 June 1997 members of the DI/IRO staff, OSS personnel, and Bonnie Hunter of your staff met with Michelle Combs and Bob Skwriot of the JFK Assassination Review Board to discuss DI document retrieval methods. The meeting was requested by the Board to provide them with a clearer understanding of DI document searches.

2.  Ilse Hartman and Joyce Jump of OSS provided a detailed overview of the document retrieval process. Ilse walked the board members through a typical request, document search, and retrieval. The Board members were satisfied with the thorough nature of the process and appreciated the time spent to provide a detailed overview.

3.  During our discussions the Board members asked for five additional topics which they felt might be appropriate to research on the JFK assassination. These were:

*   USSR, Cuba, and Mexico combined with the term assassination for the period 20-30 November 1963.

*   Minsk radio factories (where Oswald was employed) and possible Cuban training bases in the Minsk region for the period October 1959 to January 1963.

*   Helsinki and visas to try to capture information on Oswald's visa application. The Board also asked for information on hotels in Moscow and Minsk where Oswald may have stayed.

*   Information on the freighter "Marion Lykes" plus a passenger manifest covering the period 19 September to 8 October 1959.

Barry,

Welcome back! Here are the two letters we received from the LBJ Library with the listed materials attached. We can process these documents as assassination records by designating only the sections of the reports/checklist/memoranda that are assassination related and declaring the rest NBR. We could include a short memorandum which explains that these documents are compilations of lots of issues, and the NBR redactions are unrelated to the assassination. If these materials are about to be released under the Executive Order and there are no redactions in the assassination related parts, the Board will probably not need to see them.

As long as you are talking to the Executive Order folks, there were additional materials (beyond the ones specified in these letters) which the LBJ Library sent to CIA and I reviewed early last spring. Some of those items also could be designated as assassination records. I can give you a copy of the list if you don't have it. It would be nice to know what has happened to these materials too.

Thanks for checking on this issue. It is part of CIA-9 If this issue is settled, CIA-9 may be close to completion.

Michelle

Pages: 9, including this cover sheet.

COMMENTS

The following is a list of some of the LBJ Library documents that have not reached us in the review process. As I understand it, these were submitted to you by the library and marked as assassination records by Michelle. They are related to request CIA-9. As we discussed these are not the balance of the LBJ library records awaiting review, only the most easily identified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Barbara T. Blufer @ DI

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
JFK Project Officer

OFFICE: OIM/HRP

SUBJECT: ARRB Request CIA-9: President's Intelligence Checklists

REFERENCE:

Barbara,

Could you take a few minutes before the ARP to look at how we are handling the Checklists. ARRB has requested 11 (Nov. 20-30); Jim Hanrahan is reviewing.

Have you finished your review of the 24 documents sent previously? If so could you bring them with you.

The two items you gave me to review last week are not considered "assassination records"; you can close the book on them.

The ARRB staff will not complete its review of DI documents until the end of this week. Hopefully they will not select many as assassination records (AR). If possible, I would like to set up coordination session at IP. I will call you as soon as I know how many assassination records we have.

Thanks for you help.

Barry

# MEMORANDUM

September 12, 1998

To: Laura Denk
Executive Director

cc: Bob Skwirot
CIA Team Leader

From: Michelle Combs
Associate Director for Research and Review

Ben Rockwell
Analyst

Subject: CIA-9 Publications and Analytical Materials

The Review Board's Request for Additional Records and Information CIA-9 asked the CIA to locate CIA or Intelligence Community serial publications for the dates immediately before and after the assassination (November 20-30, 1963), including such publications as the President's Daily Brief, the President's Checklist, and any serial publications related specifically to Cuba or the Soviet Union. Review Board also requested that a search be undertaken for any analytical materials bearing upon the assassination.

In response to the Review Board's request, the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) searched for serial publications which might contain information of relevance to the assassination, special or ad hoc reports pertaining to the assassination, and raw intelligence reports on topics which might pertain to the assassination. All the material s supplied by the Directorate of Intelligence have been reviewed by the Review Board staff. Material within these publications, relevant to the assassination of President John Kennedy, was designated as assassination records. Due to the sensitive and worldwide nature of the information contained in most of these Directorate of Intelligence publications, only material relevant to the assassination was designated as an assassination record. These designated records will be processed and sent to the JFK Collection at the National Archives.

The Directorate of Intelligence supplied copies of the following serial publications for the period November 20-30, 1963 or containing information which from the period November 20-30, 1963.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

The President's Intelligence Checklist, the predecessor of *The President's Daily Brief*, an all-source daily summary of intelligence information designed for the President and a small number of high level officials.

The Daily Brief of the Central Intelligence Bulletin, a larger and more detailed all-source publication with a wider distribution.

The Weekly Review - Office of Current Intelligence, an all-source weekly compendium of events available on Fridays.

The Weekly Summary - Office of Current Intelligence, a more limited version of *The Weekly Review* mentioned above. *The Weekly Summary* only contained material up to the SECRET level.

According to the Directorate of Intelligence, only one analytical report on Cuba or the Soviet Union, dated November 15, 1963, was issued near the relevant period. The Review Board staff read this report but did not designate it as an assassination record.

The Review Board staff also examined *The President's Intelligence Briefing Book*, dated November 26, 1963, a compendium of information on major intelligence issues affecting the national security of the United States, which was prepared for President Lyndon Johnson. This briefing book was not designated as an assassination record.

In addition, the DI was asked to search for intelligence reporting on anti-Castro activity by Cuban exile groups in the United States from January 1961 - January 1964. *The Weekly Review - Office of Current Intelligence* for April 5, April 12, and April 19, 1963 were found to contain relevant information on exile raids on Cuban targets. The relevant portions of these documents were designated as assassination records.

Finally, the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) searched for records based on subjects supplied by the Review Board staff. The DI database is searchable only by general subject headings assigned from a master list and coded to particular documents. This database is not searchable by keyword. In response to the Review Board's request, the DI supplied raw intelligence reports (not finished analytical intelligence documents) for the period November 20 - November 30, 1963 for the USSR, Cuba, and Mexico. Documents relevant to the assassination of President John Kennedy were designated as assassination records.

The DI reported that there were no DI intelligence reports on the following subjects searched at the request of the Review Board staff:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

* USSR and assassination
* Cuba and assassination
* Mexico and assassination
* Minsk radio factories
* Cuban training bases in Minsk
* Helsinki and visas
* Hotels and Moscow
* Hotels and Minsk
* Freighter "Marion Lykes"

MEMORANDUM FOR: J. Barry Harrelson@DCI

FROM: Barbara T. Blufer
DI/IRO

OFFICE: DI/IRO

SUBJECT: Disposition of the DI/IRO on the release of Country Names in the 11
PICLs Reviewed by
Me for the ARRB

21 September 1998

REFERENCE:

1.  In light of the additional details, laying out the background of negotiations on the PICLs conducted by Linda Cipriani in OGC and articulated in a note to George last week--not sent to me, I concur with the inclusion of country names of even the non-relevant titles in the text of the reviewed PICLs. It's always easier to make appropriate decisions when one is armed with the full knowledge of the background. In light of my very short tenure in dealing with this issue, I would appreciate in the future receiving any background or additional information on prior negotiations that hay bearing on decisions I must make. Additionally, having that background information ahead of any review or disposition saves time and effort, and result in the best decision not only for the DI but also for the Agency.

2.  This concludes the DI action on this matter. A signed copy of this memorandum will be sent to Barry for his records.

SUBJECT: Resume of Employment - Birch D. O'Neal

1. Attached is a proposed resume of my employment covering the entire service to the U. S. Government.

2. I would propose to use this should the need arise. However, I would not like to be restricted to the statements therein. In 1968 I applied for admission to the Bar in the District of Columbia and prepared a detailed response to certain questions in the application. The information provided at that time went on record and should the occasion arise, I would like to be in a position to make the same statements. I do not think that such a situation will occur, but if it does, I would propose to support the attached resume with the more detailed information attached hereto and which appeared in that application.

RESUME
U. S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE
BIRCH D. O'NEAL

From January 10, 1938 on entering U. S. government service as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to February 28, 1970 (with exception of a few months in the fall and winter of 1946-47) was employed by various Departments and Agencies of the U. S. Government, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U. S. Department of Justice, U. S. Department of State, and Central Intelligence Agency. In this period of more than 32 years steadily advanced in salary with commensurate responsibilities from $3200 per annum to more than $30,000 per annum while holding various titles including Special Agent, Legal Attacho, Civil Attache, and Foreign Affairs Officer. More than 12 years of this service was performed while stationed abroad or in travel status in many foreign countries of Latin America, Europe and Africa.

While the entire service involved utilization of legal training and conduct of investigations affecting the national security interests of the United States, that from September


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

-2-

1942 to February 1970 (voluntary retirement) also involved direct supervision of investigative and clerical assistants (on occasions more than 50 employees and expenditure of extensive funds). The service also involved extensive liaison with foreign government and other U. S. government officials. Liaison on occasions, both domestic and foreign, related to matters of the highest sensitivity and importance and accordingly was conducted at highest levels (Cabinet and sub-Cabinet).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

February 1947 - March 1947. In February 1947 I entered on duty with what was known as the Central Intelligence Group,. 2430-E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C., a government body created by Executive Order which was a predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency. I was a legal liaison officer with this group.

March 1947 - December 1949. During this period I was detailed to the U. S. Department of State, 20th Street and Virginia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D. C., where I was assigned to the U. S. Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela, as Attache. In that capacity I prepared reports and advised and counselled the U.S. Ambassador on matters of a legal and political nature. In this work I employed legal knowledge, background and experience as related to the laws of the United States and the Republic of Venezuela.

January 1950 to December 1951 Central Intelligence Agency, 2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. In this period I was assigned to duties involving liaison on legal matters with other departments of the U. S. Government in-cluding the Department of Defense, Department of Justice (Immigration and Naturalization Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation) and the Department of State. Criteria for the position included knowledge, application and interpretation of U. S. and foreign laws. The establishment of the position was at the instance of the General Counsel of the Agency and my selection to the position was with his concurrence. The assignment required close working coordination and collaboration with the General Counsel of the Agency and other governmental legal counsel. I discontinued this particular work to enable me to again undertake further assign-ment with the Department of State as a member of the Foreign Service Staff Corps.

December 1951 - April 1954 - U. S. Department of State, Foreign Service Staff, Washington, D. C. During this period I served as Attache, Political Officer, American Embassy, Guatemala City, Guatemala. In that capacity I gathered in-formation concerning the legal system, laws, and enforcement thereof and counselled and advised the U. S. Ambassador on matters of a legal and political nature. In this work I employed legal knowledge and experience as related to the laws of the United States and the Republic of Guatemala. I resigned from this position in Guatemala to return to the U. S. for personal and family reasons.

April 1954 - to Present - Central Intelligence Agency,
2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. I have been employed
with this Agency since April 1954 as a Foreign Affairs Officer.
In that capacity I have had regular, almost daily contact and
liaison with the Department of Justice and Department of State
representatives on matters of a legal and political nature.
My duties involve the application of knowledge and experience
in the legal field, both foreign and domestic.

From January 1946 until June 1946, I served in the same capacity and duties under the U. S. Ambassador in Venezuela, as also the nominee representative.

From June 1946 to February 1947, I served in the same capacity and duties under the U. S. Department of Justice representative.

* * *

Frank E. Wall, 6. S. Department of Justice

June 1940 - February 1947 - on this period I briefly engaged in general practice of law. Primarily I was engaged in writing contracts, bills of sale, deeds, wills and the like. This work was in association with and as a matter of assistance to my father, Nestor Lembert Deal, Sr. whose offices were in the Donalson County Court House, Bainbridge, Georgia. I left this work to reenter U. S. government service at Washington, D. C., where my legal education and experience in liaison with foreign governments and between various departments and independent agencies could be employed to the benefit of our government.

February 1947 - March 1947 - In February 1947 I catered on duty with what was known as the Central Intelligence Group. This unity with which was also the Central Intelligence Agency. 430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C., Was created by Executive Order which was a predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency. I was a legal liaison officer with this group.

March 1947 - December 1949: During this period I was detailed to the U. S. Department of State, 20th Street and Virginia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D. C., where I was assigned to the U. S. Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela, as Attache. In that capacity I prepared reports and advised and counselled the U.S. Ambassador on matters of a legal and political nature. In his work I employed legal knowledge, background and experience related to the laws of the United States and the Republic of Venezuela.

ATTACHMENT P (Continued)

January 1950 to December 1951 - Central Intelligence Agency, 2710 E Street, Washington, D. C. In this period I was assigned to duties involving liaison on legal matters with other departments of the U. S. Government including the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of State.

The assignment included matters of U. S. and foreign law. Interpretation of the application of laws and agency selection criteria was at the instance of the U. S. and foreign officials and required close coordination and collaboration with the General Counsel of the Agency and other Government Legal Counsel to enable me to participate further as a member of the Foreign Service.

April 1954 - U. S. Department of State Foreign Service; serving at the American Embassy, Guatemala. In that capacity I was the Foreign Legal Officer, concerning the legal system, laws, and enforcement thereof and advised the Ambassador on matters of a legal and political nature. It is related to the laws of the United States and the Republic of Guatemala. I resigned from that position in Guatemala to return to the U. S. for personal and family reasons.

April 1954 to Present - (2430 "E" Street, Washington, D. C.) With this Agency since April 1951 in that capacity I have had regular liaison with the Department of Justice and matters involving the application of laws in the legal field, both foreign and domestic.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Birch D. O'Neal,
CI Staff

SUBJECT: Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. I have your memorandum of 27 October 1966 which refers to my memorandum advising you that in the initial screening of personnel eligible to become participants in the CIA Retirement System you have been determined to be ineligible because of an apparent deficiency in "qualifying duty". It is important that you realize that such a deficiency is only significant la the initial review of Agency personnel who have 15 or more years of Agency service since the law permits such persons to acquire at their ption a vested interest in the CIA Retirement System. At the same time, the law requires a minimum of 60 months qualifying duty before one can possibly qualify for retirement benefits under the CIA Retirement System. It serves no purpose, therefore, to place a person permanently in the System if there is a possibility that he may never qualify for benefits therein.

2. In paragraph 2 of your memorandan you indicate concern that failure to contest the initial findings in your case may rejudice the possibility of a favorable decision with regard to your cligibility to articipate in the CIA Retirement System at some future date. It is assumed that you were referring to the possibility that you may have some additional service that could perhapa be considered as qualifying duty under the System. As noted in paragraph 2 of my memorandum of 28 September 1966, sur initial determination of Ineligibility does not preclude reconsideration of your eligibility at some future date.

3. As you know, Regulation 20-50 provides for an appeal to the Director of any adverse determinetion under that regulation. However, the regulation also provides an opportunity or an employee to present his case to the CIA Retirement Board prior to the making of an adverse determination. Decause of the large number of employees covered in the initial screening of on-duty employees to identify those eligible for participation in the System, this procedure was not applied when, as in your case, the employee's Career Service reported that he did not meet the requirements of Regulation 20-50 for nomination as a participant. Accordingly, the procedure of notifying employees of their non-eligibility for participation in the System based upon the initial finding of an employee's Career Service has been followed in all such cases. This is contrary to the implication in aragraph 2 of your memorandum that other employees in circumstances similar to ycurs were not so informed and I would be picased to look more deeply into that aspect of your mentorandwa, If you wish.

4. In the event that you have performed service which you believe to be qualifying duty under the CIA Retirement System, you are most certainly entitled to present the details of such service to the Clandestine Services Career Service Board for review and formal submission to the CIA Retirement Board. A copy of this memorandum will be forwarded to the Executive Secretary of that Board.

27 October 1966

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Emmett D. Echols
Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Notification of Non-eligibility for
Designation as a Participant in the
CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. Reference is made to your memorandum directed to me, date: 28 September 1966, entitled as above, in which it is stated that I may request that my case be formally considered by the CIA Retirement Board and that such request must be made within 30 days of the date of the notification. Other pressing responsibilities have not permitted me to prepare for formal consideration a challenge to the decision of non-eligibility. My request, through the support officer of the Staff to which I am assigned, for a reading on retirement benefits which I might receive should I retire on 31 December 1966 or five years from that date, would not constitute a formal request of a decision as to my eligibility for retirement under the CIA Retirement System. The figures provided me in that connection were simply to serve as a guideline for my own considerations as to possible future retirement.

2. This memorandum is directed to you and to those to whom copies are designated to preclude the expiration of this date, 27 October 1966, without protesting the notification that I must provide certain notification within 30 days of 28 September 1966. I am informed that other officers of CIA who have not qualified for retirement have not in fact been given such notifications and my inquiry concerning possible benefits should not require therefore a formal decision that I am not eligible on any specific basis.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

3. I have questions with regard to certain aspects of the law and in respect to my eligibility, and this notification to you at this time is designed to preclude a loss of any right I right have under the law to challenge the decision of non-eligibility as given by you on 28 September 1966.

4. I would appreciate a forel reply acknowledg- ing this communication with a statement as to whether in fact the legal question of eligibility is now before the CIA Retirement Board or any other authority of the Agency, or is not. This request is intended not only for the Director of Personnel to stem it is primarily addressed and from whom such notification of non- eligibility was received, but also is intended for others receiving copies of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Birch D. O'Neal

THROUGH: Head of Career Service

SUBJECT: Notification of ineligibility for Designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

28 September 1966

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomination is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board. This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the System may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a participant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that you read paragraph e of HR 20-30 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not elagible to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to discuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

3. A commissioned title as First Secretary is requested for Mr. O'Neal in order that he may be enabled to carry out his duties in a secure and efficient manner. The use of a commissioned title in this instance, which has been discussed at length with appropriate offices of ARA, is believed necessary in order to make possible the appearance of a complete break between Mr. O'Neal and the previous OSO station chief, and in order to provide him with adequate cover which will integrate him completely into the Embassy in a country whose present Governinent is noticeably hostile and vigilant with regard to American intelligence activities. It is proposed that Mr. O'Neal will serve in the Political Section of the Einbassy. He will replace Mr. Collins D. Almon, who returned to the United States in March 1951.

4. The proposed biography for Mr. O'Neal will be forwarded at a later date.

5. It is requested that subject arrive at his destination on or about 15 November 1951.

Dear Fr. Olicals

Several dayn aro 1 had a call from your agency advising me that an oxisting vacancy must be filled by November 1, and that a definite commitment was necessary by October 1. Actually I had intended to be in Washington durim the early part of Soptenter for a hurther talk with you, but two court trials havo prevented this.

If convenient to you, I would like to see you in Washington this coming Monday morning, October 1. If that day happens to be inconvenient, please telegraph or telephone mo collect. I will assume ti:is timo to be agreeable unless I hear to the contrary.

I certainly appreciate the necessity for a positive corrnitment on my part, and will be prepad to Ive a definite answer when I am in dashington. Since our talk last June, quite a few personal complications have arison, which i have been attempting to resolve.

With kind personal roards,

Sincerely yours,

Mr. Dorsett conferred with the writer and Col. Sheffield Awards on 1 October. He was still in a position of not being able to state that ho would enter on duty on 1 November 1951. He mentioned various personal reasons and the necessity of conferrin with his father-in-law Sonator Willis Smith. He later called me at my home at 9:00 P:: 1 October 1951 and statea he could not enter on duty 1 November 1951, ut he continued to be interested in the job and would probably te in contact with Col. Falwards in the spring of 19:52 to determine if there contimed to be a vacancy in which he could be placed.

# Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Assistant Director/Special Operations DATE: 13 February 1951

FROM: Security Officer

SUBJECT: O'NEAL, Birch D.

Reference to your memorandum concerning return to duty of Subject sometime prior to 1 December 1951, this office will endeavor to comply with your proposals. I might say that Mr. O'Neal has done a superior job as Alien Affairs Officer for the Agency. There has been some thought given to transferring the Alien Affairs Branch from I&S to the immediate office of Mr. Dulles, and it is impossible to give a positive guarantee of his availability, which in that case would be dependent upon Mr. Dulles' decision.

I feel, however, that OSO could at least tentatively plan along the line of your proposal. The cooperation of the ADSO and Chief, FDT, in making Mr. O'Neal available has been sincerely appreciated.

Communism in this country and gives the names of
the principal Communist leaders. Attention is

gives the campaign platform that the Communist Party
is using in the election scheduled to be held December

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: CIG Administrative Order No. 31

1. CIG Administrative Order No. 31, dated October 31, 1946, makes provision for Group II classification for civilian employees who are Chiefs of Missions or principal officers directly subordinate to Washington, D.C. The Order specifies that these officials will fall in grader CAF-13 or P-6 or above, unless otherwise approved by the Director.

2. I recommend the Group II classification for Ts. B. Caldwell, Hobart Spalding, Justin O'Donnell, Albert K. Haney, and Birch P. O'Neal, who will be Chiefs of their respective Stations and directly subordinate to Washington, but whose grades are below the CAF-13 or P-6 level.

3. It is believed in each case that the fulfillment of the obligations at the Station concerned justifies the Group II classification. Therefore, there is attached a proposed letter of authorization for the Director's signature. The Director's approval of this proposed letter will permit the Special Funds Section to pay the Group II classification to the individuals concerned.

4. It is recommended that the payment under the Group II classification be made effective as of the dates the individuals concerned assume the responsibility at the overseas post.

THE CHIEF:

TO: Control, Special Operations

Acting Chief, FUT

VIA: Chief, Special Operations

SUBJECT: Request for Designation of Birch D. O'Neal.

1. Will you kindly request the State Department to designate Birch D. O'Neal as Attaché, American Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela.

2. The Caracas office has not previously been in operation under CIC and will be opened upon the arrival of r. O'Neal. Intelligence work is, at the present time, being carried on in the Caracas Embassy by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose representative in that city carries the title of legal attaché.

3. The FBI has approximately seven of its personnel stationed at this post.

4. r. O'Neal served from January 1936 to May 1940 as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1942 he spent six months in Ecuador, 1942-1943. He spent nine months in Colombia, and in 1942-1944 he spent sixteen months in Mexico. He was Civil Attaché in the American Embassy, Mexico City.

5. r. O'Neal is now located in Washington where he is completing arrangements for the opening of the Caracas station.

6. The designation has previously been refused him. Subject will perform the duties previously carried out by the Legal Attaché and will be the ranking representative of CIC, reporting directly to Washington.

7. Subject's duties will be comparable to the present FBI representative, who is assigned as legal attaché to the Embassy.

8. This designation does not involve a replacement or an increase in personnel but concerns the opening of a new CIC office.

9. In order to enable subject to operate securely, it is believed essential that he be given diplomatic status and be issued a diplomatic passport in the capacity of attaché.

Mr. Mirch F. O'Neal entered on duty 11 February, 1947, with
OSO, RET. His foreign assignment will be Chief of Station,
Caracas, Venezuela, at grade CAF-12 at a salary of $6905.20,
and he will be carried on the Special Funds payroll.

The oath of office was completed on 11 February, 1947, and
photographs, fingerprints, and other credentials required
were requested this date. Request for physical examination
and inoculations also made this date.

Agreement to remain at his station for the prescribed length
of time (24 months) was also completed by Mr. O'Neal this date.
In this connection, Mr. O'Neal posed a question with regard
to releases granted to foreign service personnel when they
wish to transfer to other government organizations while in
the field. Captain Hillsman called Mr. Warner in General
Counsel to obtain an opinion from him in this matter. Captain
Hillsman was given the following informations:

If a CIG employee wishes to transfer to another
government agency while on duty at a foreign
station, and prior to the end of his first year
abroad, the employee, if released by CIG, will not
be required to reimburse CIG for the cost of his
own transportation, that of his family, nor the
transportation of his personal effects to his original
duty post. Return transportation to the States or to
a new post with another government agency will be
the responsibility of the individual, not CIG.

Assessment approval was given 10 February, 1947: security
cleared 20 January, 1947.

SECTION' Iν
This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptions are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most individuals. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on what that phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

In the ten months Subj has been under my supervision he has shown an outstanding ability to get work done, even under the pressure of an unusually heavy work load. Subj's willingness to take on additional duties and his indefatigable efforts to discharge all responsibilities are also considered outstanding. Subj's operational and liaison experience show plainly in his daily handling of ops problems. Subj's ability to roganize material, and budget his time for greatest effeciency improved notably in the past months.

Subj is in every sense a senior intelligence officer.

In the ten months Subj has been under my supervision he has shown an outsta-ding ability to get work done, even under the pressure of an unusually heavy work load. Subj's willingness to take on additional duties and his indefatigable efforts to discharge all responsibilities are also considered outstanding. Subj's operational and liaison experience show plainly in his daily handling of ops problems. Subj's ability to roganize material and budget-hi Improved notably in the past months. Subj is

in every sense a senior intelligence officer.

At the end of a year of operations, Mr. O'Neil's record corresponds with his
previous achievements in the same class of work. He is an exceptionally steady,
industrious and conscientious officer. He obtains results and has proved his ability
to handle all aspects of the job assigned.

Since his previous report, he has not expanded his intelligence coverage to the
point-desirable in an area of importance as that where he is working. This may be
due partly to an insufficient member of assistants, and an increase in his family may
also be a factor which has prevented him from increasing his output. In Embassy (over)

2. IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL REPORT. THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL REPORTS, UTILIZING THE SAME FORM, WILL BE RENDERED.

   A. UPON COMPLETION OF FIRST NINETY (90) DAYS OF SERVICE AT A STATION.

   B. UPON RELIEF OR REASSIGNMENT OF RATING SENIOR.

   C. UPON DETERMINATION OR RECOMMENDATION THAT AN EMPLOYEE IN A FIELD STATION SHOULD BE REASSIGNED TO ANOTHER STATION OR RETURNED TO U.S. FOR REASSIGNMENT OR OTHER DISPOSITION. SUCH REPORT WILL BE FORWARDED SO AS TO REACH THE WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE AFTER SUCH REASSIGNMENT DETERMINATION IS MADE. IF POSSIBLE, THE REPORT SHOULD BE SENT IN AT LEAST THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO PROPOSED REASSIGNMENT IN ORDER THAT ALL TIME POSSIBLE MAY BE DEVOTED TO APPRAISAL AND EVALUATION. IF CONSIDERATION OF REASSIGNMENT IS BEING GIVEN WITHOUT EMPLOYEE'S KNOWLEDGE, ITEMS 1 TO 6 WILL BE FILLED IN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BY THE RATING OFFICER WITHOUT REFERRAL TO EMPLOYEE.

3. IN FAIRNESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL BEING RATED AND IN THE INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE IMPORTANCE OF CAREFULLY PREPARED AND ACCURATE EFFICIENCY REPORTS CANNOT BE OVERSTRESSED. THE FOLLOWING BASIC PRINCIPLES OF RATING SHOULD ALWAYS BE KEPT IN MIND:

   A. ALWAYS BASE YOUR JUDGMENT ON:

   (1) WHAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED THE INDIVIDUAL DO OR FAIL TO DO.

   (2) A STRIKING INCIDENT.

   (3) SPECIFIC UNDER CONSIDERATION.

   B. USED TO RATE ALL CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES. BUT REPORTING OFFICERS SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT DIFFERENT STANDARDS PREVAIL IN DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS WHEREAS IT IS NECESSARY, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER POSSESS INITIATIVE, THIS SAME TRAIT IS NOT ALWAYS DESIRABLE, EXCEPT IN A MINOR WAY, FOR A TYPIST. THE RATINGS AND EVALUATIONS SHOULD BE IN REFERENCE TO THE JOB - THE ACTUAL WORK ASSIGNMENT FOR WHICH THE PARTICULAR EMPLOYEE IS BEING PAID. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ARRIVE AT A JUST ESTIMATE OF THE QUALITIES OF THE PERSON REPORTED ON FOR THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT. AVOID EXAGGERATIONS AND SUPERLATIVES. THEY DETRACT FROM THE VALUE OF A REPORT AND ARE UNFAIR TO OTHERS.

   C. BIASED OPINIONS BASED ON PERSONAL LIKES AND DISLIKES MUST BE SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDED. IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE PREPARATION OF EFFICIENCY REPORTS IS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF ALL SUPERVISORS OF EMPLOYEES, AND THE ACCURATE AND TRUE EVALUATIONS EXPRESSED THEREIN ARE A DIRECT REFLECTION UPON HIS OWN ABILITY AND QUALIFICATION FOR THE POSITION HE HOLDS.

   C. NO REPORTS WILL BE RENDERED COVERING PERIODS OF LESS THAN 60 DAYS OBSERVED SERVICE.

   4. REPORTS WILL NORMALLY BE CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL; HOWEVER, THE CLASSIFICATION MAY BE RAISED IF DEEMED ADVISABLE BY RATING OFFICER.

5. REPORTS WILL NEVER BE SHOWN TO THE EMPLOYEE REPORTED ON.

## DISPOSITION OF REPORTS

1. REPORTS WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE APPROPRIATE BRANCH CHIEF IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD.

2. IF THE REPORTING OFFICER IS THE CHIEF OF STATION, REPORTS WILL BE FORWARDED BY HIM TO THE APPROPRIATE BRANCH CHIEF IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS.

3. IF THE REPORTING OFFICER IS NOT THE CHIEF OF STATION, THE REPORT WILL BE REFERRED TO THE NEXT IN COMMAND FOR REVIEW AND FINALLY TO THE CHIEF OF STATION FOR FORWARDING TO WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS.

4. UPON RECEIPT OF REPORT IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS, THEY WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE BRANCH CHIEFS PROMPTLY AND THEN REFERRED TO THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE FOR PERSONNEL FOR RETENSION IN THE PERSONNEL FILE OF THE EMPLOYEE.

A. IF A CHANGE OF PERSONAL STATUS IS REPORTED UNDER SECTION 8, ONE COPY OF SUCH REPORT WILL BE DETACHED AND SENT TO THE SECURITY OFFICE.

ANY DESIRED REMARKS OF REVIEWING OFFICES AND/OR CHIEF OF STATION
relations, however, he has scored great success and was the subject of a special commendatory letter written by the new Ambassador, Honorable Walter Donnelly, to the Department of State. His report writing is precise and clear but tends to be inclusive of too much detail. In this respect it is felt that he is following the practice of his previous employment with the FBI and that his training in the methods of our own organization was insufficient inasmuch as he departed for his post before full completion of the training course, a temporary assignment in Washington would be profitable to him in order to get the spirit and methods of revised intelligence operations and reporting.

He is a Chief of Station which this Branch particularly desires; and if he wishes to remain at his present post on termination of his contract, it is recommended that he-be-so-reassigned-inasmuch as he has developed a keen personal interest and corresponding knowledge of this very important area.

## ARTICLE I. Relationship of Employee to the Department of State.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

2. The Chief of the Foreign Service establishment and certain other key members of his staff will know about the Employee's status and relationship under the terms of the TOP SECRET agreement between the Department of State and-CIA. Other personnel may discover that there are certain irregularities in travel orders, position numbers, pay accounts, and other internal administrative procedures of the Foreign Service. Nevertheless, the Employee shall not divulge his relationship to CIA except with the expressed approval of the ADSO. While serving abroad, he shall for normal administration be under the control of the Chief of the Foreign Service establishment to which he is attached, but for operations, including travel as specified below, he shall be under the control of CIA.

3. The travel of the Employee shall be governed as follows:

(a) For temporary duty outside the continental limits of the United States within or beyond the Employee's stipulated area, he shall perform CIA operational travel as directed by the ADSO or his designee with the consent of the Chiefs of the Foreign Service establishment involved. TD travel customary and necessary in the performance of routine Foreign Service Staff functions may be performed without clearance from the ADSO.

(c) All travel will be directed and performed in accordance with Foreign Service rules and regulations.

4. Although the Employee's Foreign Service Staff Corps title, location, appointment, Foreign Service class, and other pertinent information may be published in the Foreign Service list and other publications of the Department of State, such listings shall not affect his employment and the obligations and duties stipulated in this contract.

5. All payments to be made under this contract, including reimbursement for travel expenses, shall be made to the Employee by the Department of State except payments referred to in ARTICLE II, Section 4.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

# ARTICLE II. Relationship of Employee to CIA. Although for
all intents and purposes it will appear as though the Employee is
employed by the Department of State as indicated in ARTICLE I above,
he shall in fact be employed by and under the operational control
of CIA. In so far as possible, he will be expected to abide by
the rules, regulations, customary practices, and courtesies of the
Foreign Service, but his ultimate responsibility will be to CIA.
In the event of any conflict of authority in the field between the
Department of State and CIA, the matter shall be referred to the
ADSO for resolution.

3. It is understood and agreed that the Employee's over- seas assignment is to be for a minimum period of two years from the date of his arrival at his overseas post of duty, unless ter- minated by the Government for its convenience. If the assignment is terminated in less than twenty-four months at the Employee's request, the following shall prevall:

(b) If the Employee desires to terminate between the twelfth and twenty-fourth month from the date of his arrival at his overseas post of duty, he shall pay all expenses for the travel and transportation of himself, his immediate family, house- hold goods, and personal effects to the United States.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

4. If deemed necessary by CIA, the Employee may be re-
   Imbursed or advanced funds for operational expenses. Such amounts
   must be advanced or reimbursement made in accordance with CIA reg-
   ulations, which require a full accounting of the amounts expended
   by the Employee. Therefore, the Employee will be required to ac-
   count fully for any such funds advanced or reimbursed in accord-
   ance with CIA regulations.

ARTICLE III. Overseas Allowances and Transportation Expenses.
When specifically authorized by the ADSO, the expenses of travel
and transportation of the Employee, his immediate family, house-

cordance with Title IX, Part D of the Foreign Service Act of 1946.

## VII. POLITICAL ACTIVITY

The terms of the act of August 2, 1939 ("Hatch Act"), as amended, prohibit officers and employees in the executive branch of the Federal Government from using official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the result thereof. Further, such officers and employees are prohibited from taking any active part in political management or in political campaigns. These prohibitions apply not only to permanent employees, but also to temporary employees, employees on leave of absence with or without compensation, and substitute employees during the period of active employment. Political activity identified with any political party in any election is prohibited.

Some of the forms of forbidden political activity are:

1.  Serving on or for any political committee, party, or other similar organization.
2.  Soliciting or handling political contributions.
3.  Serving as officer of a political club, as member or officer of any of its committees, addressing such a club, or being active in organizing it.
4.  Serving in connection with preparation for, organizing, or conducting a political meeting or rally, addressing such a meeting, or taking any other active part therein except as a spectator.
5.  Engaging in political conferences while on duty, or canvassing a district or soliciting political support for a party, faction, or candidate.
6.  Manifesting offensive activity at the polls, at primary or regular elections, soliciting votes, assisting voters to mark ballots, or helping to get out the voters on registration or election days.
7.  Acting as recorder, checker, watcher, or challenger of any party or faction.
8.  Serving in any position of election officer, in which partisanship or partisan political management may be shown.
9.  Publishing or being connected editorially or managerially with any newspaper generally known as partisan from a political standpoint, or writing for publication or publishing any letter or article, signed or unsigned, in favor of or against any political party or candidate. (Ownership entirely disassociated from editorial control and managerial activities limited entirely to business management would not be regarded as being within this provision.)
10. Becoming a candidate for nomination or election to office, Federal, State, or local, which is to be filled in an election in which party candidates are involved.

11. Distributing campaign literature or material.
12. Initiating or circulating political petitions, including nomination petitions.
13. Assuming political leadership or becoming prominently identified with any political movement, party, or faction, or with the success or failure of any candidate for election to public office.

General statements as to certain activities which are considered as permissible on the part of Federal officers and employees:

1.  Voting. The direct language of the law specifically provides that all such persons retain the right to vote as they may choose.
2.  Expression of opinions. The right to express political opinions is preserved to all such persons.

NOTE: This reservation is subject to the prohibition that such persons may not take any active part in political management or in political campaigns.

3.  Contributions. It is lawful for any officer or employee to make a voluntary contribution to a regularly constituted political organization, provided such contributions are not made in a Federal building or to some other officer or employee within the scope of the act referred to above.
4.  Political pictures. It is lawful for any officer or employee to display a political picture in his home if he so desires.
5.  Badges, buttons, and stickers. While it is not unlawful for an officer or employee to wear a political badge or button or to display a political sticker on his private automobile (except where forbidden by local ordinance), it is felt that it is inappropriate for any public servant to make a partisan display of any kind while on duty, conducting the public business.
6.  Penalties. Persons appointed to positions in the Executive branch of the Federal Government are warned that the penalty for an established violation of the above mentioned political activity prohibitions is immediate removal from the service.

Certain other statutes prohibit Federal officers and employees from engaging in various activities under penalty of fine or imprisonment, or both. The activities prohibited by such statutes relate to such matters as political assessments, political coercion and discrimination, and purchase and sale of office. The text of these statutes is set forth in Civil Service Commission Form 1236.

Some of the activities prohibited under penalty of fine or imprisonment, or both, are as follows:

1.  Solicitation or receipt of political contributions by one officer or employee from another.
2.  The giving or handing over of a political contribution by one employee to another.
3.  Solicitation or receipt of political contributions in a Federal building by any person, whether or not an employee of the Government.
4.  Solicitation or receipt by any person of political contributions from any person receiving any benefit under any act of Congress appropriating funds for relief.

# Notes for Examining Physician

Weturr.--Males, without clothing, and also in ordinary clothing without overcoat or hat (weigh twice); females clothed, but without wrap or hat. If overweight, state whether due to bone and muscle or to fat.
Hrmour-Without boots or shoes, observe that no appliances are used to increase.
The examination should include the following observations:

1. Eyon.--Ptosis; discharge; corneal scar; pterygium. In recording distant vision consider 20 feet as normal and report all vision as a fraction with 20 feet as numerator and the smallest type read at 20 feet as denominator. If glasses are used, record for each eye the finding with and without glasses. Near vision must be reported. In testing vision without glasses the applicant or appointee should be instructed to remove the glasses at least one-half hour before testing uncorrected vision.

2. Ears.--Evidence of middle ear or mastoid disease; condition of drums; discharge. In recording hearing, record 20 feet as normal distance for conversational voice and word deviation from normal as fraction with 20 as denominator and actual distance as numerator.

3. Nose.--Ability to blow through each nostril. If free, a speculum examination would not be indicated.

4. Mouth and throat--Missing teeth, pyorrhea; tonsils, hypertrophy or disease.

5. Gastro-intestinal.--Ulcers, inflammations, etc.

6. Thyroid-Presence of tumor in neck and tremor, exophthalmos; nervous high-strung disposition, especially in women

7. Heart.--Murmurs, State whether functional or organic. If valvular disease exists, state whether or not it is fully compensated. Arteriosclerosis.

Record of urinalysis, if made: Sp. gr. .................. Albumen ..................
If tachycardia is present, give pulse rate: Sitting .................. Immediately after exercise .................. Two minutes after exercise ..................

8. Lungs-It is necessary that the auscultatory cough be listened. It tuberculosis is present, state whether action of arrested; if arrested, state your opinion as to how long it has been quiescent. Sputum to be examined for tubercle bacilli in all suspected cases.

9. Hernia. Give details as to size, location, etc., and whether well-fitting truss is worn. Inguinal hernia exists when ring is enlarged and on coughing visceral impulse is felt which follows the finger on withdrawal.

10. Varicocele-If varicocele is present, state approximate size as size of walnut, lemon, etc.

11. Flat foot of such a nature as to incapacitate or become aggravated by work or be alleged later to have been caused by accident or occupation. By "flat foot," as used in this form, is meant a sore foot with impaired function, the term being equivalent to "fallen or misplaced arch," an abnormal condition. Impairment of function is the point to be noted. An anatomically fat foot, but strong, is not disqualifying.

2. IN 22 SEP 95 ISSUE, WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ENTITLED "CIA BUGGED SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY." THE ARTICLE *IS BASED ON CIA DOCUMENTS DECLASSIFIED UNDER THE<JFK ASSASSINATION> RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992. MOST OF THE DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS ARE EDITED STATION CABLES FROM THE EARLY 1960'S. HQS HAD ATTEMPTED TO BLOCK THE RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENTS; REGRET THAT WE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL

3. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES SOME AGENCY ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO *CITY IN TIMEFRAME OF THE<JFK ASSASSINATION.> MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, FROM A DAMAGE STANDPOINT, THE ARTICLE STATES" THE CIA HAS TRIED TO KEEP SECRET ITS WIRETAP OPERATION, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. THE AGENCY HAS ARGUED THAT DISCLOSING SUCH PAST ACTIVITIES MIGHT ENDANGER SIMILAR ONGOING OPERATIONS, IN MEXICO CITY OR ELSEWHERE." WOULD APPRECIATE STATION'S INPUT ON ANY REACTION BY LIAISON (PARTICULARLY KDSOMBRERO) OR UNILATERAL ASSETS TO THIS FURTHER DISPLAY OF THE INABILITY OF THE USG TO KEEP CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE.

QUESTIONNAIRE PREPARED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FORMATION (IFEDEC) CONCERNING THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN EACH OF THE SIX CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. LAUREANO BATISTA, THE IFEDEC REPRESENTATIVE AT THE SEMINAR, REQUESTED THAT REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THE COUNTRIES PREPARE WRITTEN REPLIES TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE.

2. COSTA RICAN AND NICARAGUAN REPRESENTATIVES, PARTICULARLY JORGE MONGE OF COSTA RICA, REACTED IN AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE AND SUSPICIOUS FASHION TO THE IFEDEC QUESTIONNAIRE AND REFUSED TO PROVIDE WRITTEN ANSWERS. OTHER REPRESENTATIVES HAD LITTLE DESIRE TO PROVIDE WRITTEN ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE BUT GENERALLY DID NOT REACT AS STRONGLY AS DID THE COSTA RICANS AND NICARAGUANS. THOSE MOST OPPOSED TO BATISTA'S REQUEST EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS AN IFEDEC PLOY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THEY DUBBED THE QUESTIONNAIRE EFFORT "OPERATION CAMELOT." BATISTA EXPLAINED THAT THE INFORMATION REQUESTED WAS REQUIRED BY THE LATIN AMERICAN CENTER FOR INFORMATION (CIDAL), AN ORGANIZATION RECENTLY FOUNDED IN CARACAS BY THE AMERICAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION (ODCA) AND HEADED BY BATISTA.

THE SALVADORAN REPRESENTATIVES AT THE SEMINAR, AT LEAST, HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF DAL. IT WAS FINALLY DECIDED THAT NO WRITTEN

MEMORANDUM FOR: Doputy Diroctor for Plane

SUBJECT: Background Material for Dr. Tyson's visit on Wednesday, Jamiary 7th.

1. I would like the attached papers to call to your attention the very good work that Dr. Tyson has done which is generally not known here. His successful use of emigros in making a calm and factual pre-sentation to the Azerican public of conditions behind the Iron Curtain is, in my opinion, the basis on which the Crusade for Freedom can be run by the Heritage Foundation in the future.

2. Dr. Tyson shares our doubts about the Free University in Exile. He agrees that the two principles upon which the University was founded:

A. that there were sufficient qualified Iron Curtain escapees to justify institutionalizing their education; and

B. that by creating such an institution for escapees an esprit de corps is created, together with a determination on the part of the escapoes to serve their homelands at some future date

have not been proved.

3. All of the evidence to prove the validity of these principles is certainly not in. The evidence at hand raises serious doubts, and is as follow

A. Of the current 208 students of the Free University, 37 are Yugoslavs, ami 12 were born in Western European countries. (The high total ratio - almost 25% of the student body of Yugoslav students, which is not a target country, together with the non-satellito born students indicates an inability to recruit the kinds of students the University was intended to train.) It should also be noted that from the information available to us it is not possible to determine what proportion of those listed as born in target countries actually left them before Soviet domina-tion. I have the impression, which is substantiated by the recruit ing missions of Mr. Royal Tyler throughout Europe and even Turkey, that suitable candidates are already extremely difficult to find. It should be noted also that of the 64 outside scholarships given to exiles in various Europaan Universities, 16 are for Yugoslavs.

B. We have had various reports which indicate that the morale of a number of students at Strasbourg is not good. These morale problems arise from a variety of reasons, among which are:

(1) They are not entirely certain why they are there and just what the American sponsors intend for them;

(2) They fear that after they finish their education they will be without jobs;

(3) There has been a steady and systematic campaign carried on by French Communist students at the University of Strasbourg to demoralize and disorganize the FEUE student body. In addition, several students are suspected of being espionage agents.

4. Dr. Tyson is leaving for Europe on the 21st of January to make a thorough investigation and evaluation of the Free University in order to answer these questions. We are aiding him by having the officials of the President's Escapee Program make available a complete inventory of escapees who might be potential candidates for the University.

5. Dr. Tyson was not the instigator of the proposals for a gymnasium for the Free University. The proposals were made and pushed by Royal Tyler and Spencer Phenix. The handling of this matter as far as Tyler was concerned was another example of his difficulties in dealing with Phenix for, as financial officer of NCFE, and having no position in the separate corporation, that is, the Free University, Phenix has and is dealing with matters of policy.

Dear Archie:

I much enjoyed our chance for a talk, and Bill Durkee, who assists me in the subject we discussed, is tremendously enthusiastic, as I am, about the possibility that you will consider favorably the appointment Frank mentioned.

Let me state again what seems to me most important in the facts under discussion. The job is of national and world-wide importance. It can help achieve greatness. It can endanger us all. It requires a man of imagination and ideas but also a man of deep and thoughtful responsibility to discharge it well.

I should like you to consider that I am at your service at any time to give you any facts you would like to have ar any opinions for that matter. All of us here consider that we would be greatly privileged to be able to help you if you undertook the job.

Sincerely,

Thomas W. Braden

MEMORANDUM

The National Committee for a Free Europe's policy in respect to Yugoslavia and Yugoslav exile activities may be summarized in the following statements.

1. The Committee does not now, nor does it plan to interfere, by radio or otherwise, with the domestic affairs of the Yugoslav people or of the Titoist regime.

2. In so far as our anti-Stalinist aims and activities coincide, we see no reason to obstruct such functional and mutually beneficial arrangements as may from time to time present themselves. Specifically, we have no objection to exchanging with Radio Belgrade certain types of radio materials in respect to the countries under Soviet domination which might enhance the effectiveness of our radio program or otherwise aid the work of the National Committee for a Free Europe.

3. As an anti-Communist organization dedicated to the concepts of democracy and of individual freedom we feel it is entirely consistent and proper to extend aid to democratic Yugoslavia exiled from their homelands, within the budgetary and other limitations under which we operate. To this end a total of some 69 Yugoslavs are retained by the Committee and engaged in five types of work.

a) In Radio Free Europe, which has no Yugoslav desk, 13 Yugoslavs have been engaged as information analysts, program advisors and translators because of their technical abilities.

b) In the Mid-European Studies Center 31 Yugoslavs are engaged in research projects connected with the East European Inquiry, the Law project and the East European Accessions List, and include 7 scholarship students.

c) In the Research & Publications Service 9 Yugoslavs are engaged in analysis of the Yugoslav press and other sources of information and in the publication of factual, non-propagandistic studies and bulletins designed to keep the emigration and interested Americans informed on domestic events.

d) The Free Europe University in Exile has selected 13 Yugoslav students on the same basis of individual merit as students from the other European Communist nations have been granted scholarships to study at Strasbourg.

e) Finally, the National Councils Division gives financial aid to three formerly prominent Yugoslavs in recognition of their past services to the cause of democracy.

In conclusion, the number of Yugoslavs thus supported by the Committee's various divisions represents 1.4% of the total exile staff.

SUBJECT: National Committee for a Free Europe

1.  I would like to call DD/P's attention to this unsolicited memorandum. It is additional evidence for my own observation made to him orally that the work of backstopping NCFE is being carried forward in a manner which at least attempts to meet the challenge of servicing the entire Agency in those aspects of NCFE work which can be useful to the various Divisions of the Agency.

2.  As he is aware, NCFE conducts an enormous amount of research and other activity. I believe we can now say with some certainty that this record is being put to use by Washington.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: University of the Saar

1.  The University of the Saar was created on 8 March 1947. It has four facilities -- two in Saarbrucken (Letters and Law) and two in Hombourg (Medicine and Science). Faculty members are French, German, Swiss, British and Saarois.

2.  A number of "institutes" exist with undefined relations to the University though financed, as is the rest of the University, by the French Government, and include a special institute for interpreters, an institute for economic science, and a European Institute. The support of the French Government of this University, aside from its merits, is part of the French attempt to Europeanize the Saar.

3.  The European Institute, devoted to European unity, is a recent creation and is largely the result of the promotions of former Deputy, Andre Philip. It was the European Institute to which the Herald Tribune article specifically refers.

4.  The University participated extensively, especially the European Institute, in the European Youth Campaign. Some of the specific activities were as follows:

March 1952: The Campaign cooperated with the International Institute of the University of Sarrebruck in arranging a meeting of young professors in the Saar and another meeting of youth leaders, both to discuss European problems. Films were supplied by the Campaign for both these meetings.

By the end of April, 25 youth organizations (practically all) in the Saar were associated with the Campaign. During April, May, and June an extensive program of discussion groups was arranged in the secondary schools throughout the Saar. These groups were sponsored jointly by the Campaign and the youth groups of the Saar. The groups discussed all phases of the unity question but concentrated particularly on the Schuman


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

Plan due to the economic position of the Saar in this matter. Films and publications of the Campaign were used in the discussions. 7000 students participated.

During June 1952, in cooperation with the Campaign, students and professors of the International Institute formed a committee along with youth leaders to discuss the particular problems of the Saar in a United Europe.

On March 27, 1952 the Campaign held a large study group in cooperation with the European Institute of the University of the Saar. Students attended from Aix, Hambourg, Oxford, Tubingen, Leyden, Nancy, Berlin and Paris. Lecturers were provided by the Campaign.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Call by Spencer Phenix on DDCI

1. Spencer Phonix will call upon the DDCI Friday for the purpose of taking up with him certain questions among which are the following:

a. A gymnasium for the Strasbourg University. The history of the gymnasium request is as follows:

On 8 August 1952, at a meeting of the PRC, NCFE proposed capital expenditures of $377,500 for the Free University in Exile. Thie amount was placed in a reserve fund along with other requested budget items. It was agreed that funds held in this reservo could be released to NCFE by the DD/P in conjunction with the DD/A if in their Judgment the submission of further data justified such expenditures.

On 17 September 1952, Spencer Phenix, for NCFE, made a request for $47,000 to be released from the CIA-held reserve for the construction of a gymnasium at the Free University.

This request was rejected by the DD/P. He said he would reconsider the request if further data supported it.

On 8 October 1952, Mr. Phenix made another request supplying further data. This time the request was reduced to $43,500. This request was also rejected by the DD/P.

SECRET
Security Intion


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

By memorandum of 5 December 1952, Mr. Phenix refers to the fact that the trustees have given formal approval to the establishment of a gymnasium and that his under- standing of the reserve fund is that when the Board of Directors of NCFE ask for the money, they recoive it at once. He says that there appears to be some misunder- standing of this procedure, pointing out that the locus of misunderstanding "is in and around Frank W's office."

b. The Turkish Broadcasting Station. Mr. Phenix intends to raise this question as a basic policy matter, he having been informed by us that while there is great enthusiasm for the project and while the State Department has set January 15th as the date by which VOA must either secure agreement from the Turkish Government or withdraw itself from consideration, the basic policy question of whether RFE then moves in has not been definitively settled.
Mr. Phenix would like to know definitely now whether, contingent upon the failure of the Voice to gain entry to Turkey, NCFE can proceed with the building of a Turkish station. This item, which will probably be in the neighborhood of five million dollars, was presented at the PRC meeting, at which time it was agreed it would be considered as a separate project at a later date.

c. The Slansky Trial. Mr. Phenix is worried about the statements in the Slansky trial indicating use of RFE by the United States Government to send operational messages. We have told him that this secret arrangement was made with RFE by CIA men in the field. No approval of Headquarters was ever requested. Corrective steps have been taken in the FE Division to insure that action which may compromise operational facilities does not occur again without prior consultation with and approval of top authority of NCFE and CIA.

d. Barbara Bowen. Mr. Phenix is concerned about a little girl who works in the Munich office, who through some mischance of several years standing is still on the roles of this Agency and draws retirement pay, although her salary is paid by NCFE. Phenix regards this as a penetration though in fact Miss Bowen is a valued employee of NCFE and has no contact with anyone from CIA. We are trying to regularize the situation by affording her the opportunity of resign- ing from the Agency or resigning from NCFE.

e. Second Installation for Strasbourg University. The trustees of the Free University in Exile have voted to create a German-speaking free university in exile, probably to be located in the Saar. Phenix reports in his memorandum of December 5th that the DDCI has given Royal Tyler assurance regarding this extension.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

-3-

Mr. Phenix requests assurance that if Mr. Royal Tyler approaches
French authorities at the Bear to create such a university and is
granted permission, the Agency will supply the funds. No formal
request has been made and the project of course has not been
budgeted.

f. Names of pensioned Army and Navy Officers. In compliance
with DD/P Notice No. 20-5 issued on 27 October, we have asked Mr. Phenix
to furnish the names of pensioned Army and Navy officers employed by
NCFE. Mr. Phenix is concerned about the legal ramifications of this
step, stating his fear that what this order implies for him is that
the monies he dispenses as Treasurer are government funds. He has
been assured by us that the purpose of the Agency-wide request is to
inventory those who are receiving Navy and Army pensions and serving
in proprietary organizations. He has also been assured that Army and
Navy pensioners in his organization will be exempt from any action
taken by the Agency on the problem of double pay. He is quite natur-
ally worried about it.

2. The Philosophy of Spencer Phenix. In arguing his case on
   the above questions, and others, Phenix brings to his support the
   argument that he is not dispensing government funds. He says that
   once government funds reach the 1848 Foundation they become private
   funds. This is no mere self-delusion for the sake of maintaining a
   position before his conscience. Because from this conviction he
   proceeds to argue:

a. that the Agency cannot ask him to furnish such names
as suggested above, or lists and records of any kind.

b. that the Agency has no right to query the decisions
of the staff and directors as to the expenditure of
funds once released by the Agency.

c. that the Agency has no right to intervene in NCFE
affairs or to issue guidance or instructions after
funds have been passed. Phenix modifies this point
by volunteering that the Directors are always glad
to receive advice from friends such as DCI.

3. Spencer Phenix is a good man at his job and I understand
   the futility of arguing principle rather than cases. Nevertheless,
   the Phenix philosophy, argues as it is to the staff and directors
   of NCFE, and stated to us whenever possible -- frequently without
   relation to the facts under discussion -- often untempered by good
   humor, is beginning to try the souls of other good men.

The Honorable Joseph C. Grew
2543 Woodlend Drive, N.W.
Washington 8, D. C.

Dear Mr. Grew:

Attached herewith you will find a most interesting summary of the methods that have been adopted by the USSR to attract the minds of youth in the satellite states.

It has long been known that some such program was being followed, but it is only recently that detail has become available.

In contrast to these methods, efforts expended in this country to teach our young people the real meaning of freedom as represented by western democracy are feeble. It is almost safe to state that we have been relying solely on an innate, sentimental aversion to "communism", because no intelligent or systematic means have as yet been organized that will capture the minds of the young people of the United States in the same fervent manner that the communist ideology has taken hold of Russian youth.

For a little more than a year, in connection with the reorganization of the research activities of the Division of Intellectual Cooperation we have been attempting to enlist the help of American intellectuals - not the intelligentsia. There is a difference.

From the very beginning I have been amazed to discover the dearth of people who are familiar with that section of Europe which engages HOPE interest - the belt of countries extending from the Baltic to the Aegean. I was curious to find out why there were so few upon whom we could draw for help, so I started an inquiry. The results are now being computed.

We must remember that the teaching of history or of government in America has never been emphasized to the same degree that it has in Europe. The curricula of the secondary schools in that part of the world cover those subjects much more comprehensively than is the case with us. It was difficult for me to appreciate this at first, but our inquiry has verified it without any doubt. In practically all European countries now on either side of the Iron Curtain it has long been tradition to emphasize instruction in history, because the tides of war and change have ebbed and flowed across their lands for many centuries. We have reacted and in most respects free from foreign influences as we have developed our democratic processes. Your American foreign policy faces grave

issues, and in one part of the world it is deeply concerned with the very section of Europe thout which mal NCFE sctivities revolve. Yet the Americen public is practically illiterate respecting this ere, both its pest and its present. I know whereof I speck as a result of the imiry moove referred to. When it is completed I am inclined to think the results will be startling, particularly if we bear in mind tut the i rues at ste must be settled; that they are a concern to this country; and thet our people are preeticly unirformed. They now little 1. anytida bout the historical similicance behind what has occurred or will occur er the next few decades untold beeruse they ave hed no opportunity to learn the nistoric significance of it all.

In this country torry there are approximately 600 colieres end univerci-ties ofrerin four your courses of study rendang to the archelor of Arts degreее. This figure does not include the 575 junior collegen which usually conduct non-derrec-granting programs to years in length - coproxamrtely the first two years of the traditional four year proprim. As for es our incuiry her gone it is alrendy spparent that there are only several dozen institutions in the former group which offer instruction in this area, and very few in the latter. Most of those which do cover this arce are the farger universities where the courses are rolly Eraduate in character and thus elective. in man instances brici coverage is supplied in curvey cources, but even these con pot snu do not develop the attention that historically this part of the world now deserves. When this survey is completed a comprehensive report of the findirre will be mode. It will refer to colleges included in a list compiled of the American Council on Erection which is the overall representative organization in this country cor higher education.

I am colling the attention of the Directers to this situstion becsuce it seems to me we must realize that the imericen public not only does not know whet we are doing, out actually can not understand the significance e se are trying to do it. Generation efter generation hos grown up in America illite ste about the outside world. What we ere discoverer concerning the trek of korledre of this eree will of course prove true of other ports at the globe suens the Far East or South Africa,

In our Division we reel this particularly strongly because re cre dependent on help from the acaderic world. The pirin fact is more and more evacent that we can not rely on Americn higher education as a proli ic source or assistance. The relatively row individuals who have studied this region, and who are therefore qualified to sid us in our efforts, are either too overburdened with demands made on their time because they are cuniiiieu, or they are too yeun and inexperi-enced to be reliea on in an enterprise no delicate as the ore which we cre conducting.

There are signs that in some academic localities interest in this field ic developing. however, we can not wit for another generation to energe even thoura, under whatever cuspices, a procran of training could be implemented to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

The Honorable Jose n C. Grow - 3 - October 31, 1957

correct the situation. The important question is whrt can we do about it and what enell we do.

As already stated, the inquiry above mentioned grew out of our attempts to discover people in American higher eduation who are qualified to help us. We suspected they were not numerous, but we are amazed at the small number. We shall continue to try to persuade them to help us, but that well has begun to run dry already.

Can those associated with us do anything to emphasize this situation strongly enough in some quarters so that something will be attempted to correct it? Obviously this is not a problem that fits within the scope of NCFE; the problem concerns all colleges, universities , secondary schools and the enormous field designated as adult education. Responsibility may even rest with the Government itself.

I shall appreciate your suggestions, and will send you the final report of this survey when completed.

Sincerely yours,

Levering Tyson

10 July 1952

1.  At the last Project Roviow Committee meeting on NCFE, you asked that the State Department be consultod on policy in respect to National Councils. A roview by State has bogun. Meantime, however, for your information and in order to enable you to answer questions which may be raised by Messrs. Dolbearo or Miller, I want to explain to you how the 10 Division is presently handling exile affairs.

2.  The difficulty in this matter arises largely from the fact that three organizations are doing the job. Stato has appar ently found it necessary to deal directly with exiles. CIA area divisions, EE and SE, also doal directly with exiles for aroa purposes. NCFE hands out the money and tries to keep them together in National Councils. Out of this triplo play a large degree of bad feeling and mistrust has arisen between CIA and State on the one hand and NCFE on the other. State, including Wally Barbour, and the area divisions of CIA accuse NCFE of playing personal petty favorites and of not keeping us informed. On the other hand, coop- eration of State and CIA with NCFE in giving positive continuing guidance in their efforts has not been forthcoming. In the past no coordinated attempt has been made to give NCTE high-lovol over all policy direction. Relations have been personal, casual, uncoordinated, and sometimes confusing.

3.  We have taken the following action to try to insure orderly efforts to fuse or coordinate the various oxile activities conducted by the three organizationss

a. This division has asked the concerned area divisions to initiate plans for reorganization and unification of each national council. The resultant paper is then coordinated with the proper authorities in State and a final line is agreed upon.

b. This plan is then communicated to NCFE and the organisation is asked for comments, criticisms and suggestions.

c. After such are made or agreed upon, the paper becomes the policy directive which charts NCFE's course of action.

-1-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

d. NCFE then informs this division of progress being made and supposedly requeurs authority to depart from such completed policy papers.

To date two such policy directivce have been written. The first was a plan for the reorganization of the kumani an National Council. It was submitted to ICFE, and their criticisms and suggestions have been incorporated. The plan is now being oxecuted.

The second was a similar State Department-CIA paper on the reorganization of the Bulgarian Hational Commd tiec. This will be submitted to NCFE on Thursday, 10 July, and a similar course of action will be followed.

4. I realize that this will seem to you as a somewhat simple and obvious way of insuring coordination, but the fact is that it had never been done before. I hope that it results inas fow flaps as possible and as few occasions when people are running off in all directions.

5. A current case where people are running off in all directions is the Folish situation. Tida broke at the very time wo were beginning work on a coordinated CIA-State-NCFE paper. NCFE has been operating upon the assumption that if a Polish National Council is to be formed, all groups are to te represented. Unknown to NCFE, and in fact to mo, EE Division has been smaking attempts to unify two of the three main groups by holding conversations with representatives in London. There are a good many chargea and counter-charges flying about at present on this situation. The man abroad is saying he had informeu NCFE of what he intended to do, and people in NCFE say he hadn't. We are trying to straighten it out, but the situation is illustrative of how the plan above outlined can prevent such flaps.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Proposed Visit by Robert Lang with Officials of CIA

REFERENCE: EYES ONLY Memorandum to C/P from Richard Helms,
Acting Chief, Operations, DD/F, dated 25 Nov. 1952

1. After consultation with Mr. Dirkee, I would like to make the following comments on Mr. Helms' memorandum. Mr. Helms is correct that Mr. Lang has had difficulty in dealing with CIA. Mr. Helms is also correct if he understood that this state of affairs is the responsibility of Admiral Miller. (To Admiral Miller's responsibility must be added that of Spencer Phoenix, Vice-President and Treasurer.)

2. Within and outside NCPI, Admiral Miller's dealings with Mr. Lang are based on two attitudes:

a. Miller's desire to have control of his organization by having everything channeled through him; and

b. Miller's desire to maintain an autonomous organization which will accept over-all policy guidance from the highest levels of the government, but which will not allow either domination by, or close contact with, CIA in order to discuss that organization's problems or to be informed of its vehemently disordered activities.

In this connection, a statement by Admiral Miller in a letter to Mr. Alan Valentine, until recently President of the Committee for Free Asia, is of interest:

1 August 1952

"It was good to see you, if just for an instant, in Washington.

"For your private ear, I might tell you that we won our battle hands down. Merely to confirm this, our Executive Board is having lunch in Washington with Allen and Pedell next Monday. This will be a general talk, but I am sure that policies will come up for discussion. Happily, everything seems to be sailing along in good shape."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

This letter was written at a time when the 10 Division had achieved for CIA its first detailed budget from NOTE and was further arking a mutuality of relations between NCPE and (Is, ultimately defined in Memorandum of Understanding, dated 24 September, signed by H. B. lllor and Alien W. Duiles. It proves what at the time we only suspected, that Killer was calling on support from Valentino against CIA..

3. Mr. Poniz 1 ang maont Admiral Filler's tendency for tight adaimotration. Poth cave carried on a camped within N to disorodit Killer. However, Mr. menix, perhaps Lang, and almost all of tho responsible officials for back #iller in tas attitude towards CIA. for example, despite mpeated roquostu-ty / and as recontly as wroe weeks ago by DOCI personally, Millor has refused to tum over to CIA a liet of NCPF employees. Even a request ly C to John Hugnes has failed to produce this list.

In addition, Br. Phonix acts as the Semen oxport in NCFE, cutting out Lang. Peniz alone has negotiated and dealt with Gordan higa officials on AFE's position in Germany. Fr. Lang and Pir. Phenix have fundamental disputes about how are a German problema should bo handlod. rart of dr. Lang's desire for poracial talks with officialo of the Department of stato grows out of ids with to get baoking for his position.

4. In a sense, ilfe is the last NCF boation to bo nealad. Mr. Leng'e statement that he has received Artwally no muidance, policy or otherwise from this organization 10 largely a play on words. fr. Lang has not cought the guidance of nombers of his own organization, much less the guidance of CIA. seen the 10 Division bok over responsibility for NOFT, the CIA intelligence support unit, waica expplied RFT Information and guidance, was abolished on Mr. Lang's arivico that such information and ridance wero m longer necessary. RFE broadcasting policy is sot dom in a handbook wich has been thoroughly examined and nocepted by CLA and from time to time specific guidance nas teen given to . HFE accepts any materials and midance as suggestions, not orders. We beliove Lang is gotting all the guidance tnore is to ivo, and that he is looking for the kind of dah poilcy forecasting which does not exist.

5. These are the political facts of life for the 10 Division, and indeed for CIA. Tie [ Avision has attempted to deal with wala situation by: (1) winning the confidence of the Virectors and Division heads of NOFF, and (2) maintaining friendly personai relationship with both Admiral Miller and Mr. Spencer Enenix. Much propress has been made in gaining knowledge of, anxi control over, the activities of NCTE.

Aside from friendly dealings, our specific concept of gaining control over NCFE as a whole, has been to push and oncourage the thought that NCFE should be operated as a whole. The present sparation and uncoordinated activities of divisions, cupeciaily KFF, while perhars


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

necessary in the past, is not satisfactory at present. Added to this has been the theme that there must be a re-thinking of what NCFE has done, is doing, and should do in wie future. Our efforts aro bapinning to bear fruit. We have found that these lines have struck a responsive chord among the working personnel of NOTE. In many ways, the current RFE difficulties in Germany - unfortunate as they are -- nave been holphil, for they have made it clear to everybody concerned, including Mr. Long, that re-thinking of objectives and tocniquou based on comp- arative offort by CF and CIA as a wholo is vital if the orgardgation is to do ito job effectively.

6. To reformulate our own and NCFE's ideas, the 10 Division has been and is carrying on discussions with the officials and working personnel of NOWE. In some of these diucussions, Mr. Francis D. Stevena of the State Department has been a direct participant. Ine 10 Division has also boen exploring these matters with officials of CIA and the Department of State.

7. Inoce discussions have covered a wide variety of subjects whial: oan generally be described as follows:

a. What 18 NCPE's place as a whole in American policy toward the satellito natione; what is American policy; what modifications are likely?

b. How can ICPT, especially the Division of Emigro Halations, contribute more effectively to psychological and political warfare, not only for effects behind the Iron Curtain but in the time world For example: How can NCFD securely engage in furtior activities in the pattern of its successful actions at the United Nations Clave Labor Hearings and the Intorm tional fod Cross Meetings at Toronto?

c. Should NCF continue to apport enigra councils, or should some other technique be developed wmics can onabio it to make more effective use of emigres for psychological wariate purposes!

d. How can the Research and iublications Division, the Divi- aton of Intellectual Cooperation, and the Free University boat contribute to those efforts?

e. Is NCFE efficiently organized/ what, for example, is the affect of the Division of sikre kelations' dealings wiin emigros on the position of RFE in Europe, etc.?

f. How tho formidable research and information resources of NOFE can socurely be used by A

g. How can NCE be geared more closely to the activities and needs of CIA?

h. Analysis of Radio Free Europe's effectiveness, programming, political position in Germany, how RFT can be used to support CIA operations specifically, alternate broadcasting sites for KFE ato.

1. How can CIA give specific guidence to RFE? What kind of information is wanted, for example, by RFE? What studies and means of overcoming Jamming can be made available to RFE? How can American and Brition logations in the satellites best provide guidance and information for RFE?

7. These are some of the topics being discussed. In a few weeks the time will come in my opinion when the main outlines of this common thought will be sufficiently clear so that the working officials of NCFE, including Kr. Lang, should meet with officials of CIA and the Department of State for two main purposest

a. A briefing on U.S. policy toward CIA operations berind the Iron Curtain so that trace officials will see clearly the way in watch they are expected to fit into total U.S. efforts, and the manner in wizich they should operate.

b. Analyze and contribste, in come detail, to the main lines of thought developed in order to arrive at comprehensive working policy for HCPE, and detailed methods of its cooperation with CIA.

8. For the foregoing reasons, I suggest that Mr. Lang does not, at this time, come down to meet the CIA.officials as sugposted by Mr. Helme but that Mr. Lang'e visit be a part of the ID Division's over-all effort to gain working control over NCEE au briefly outlined above.

# MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, IO Division

# SUBJECT:
Formation of a Unified Rumanian Refugee Organisation

# REFERENCES:
Memorandum to IO, Subject: Current U. S. Attempt to form a Unified Rumanian Refugee Organization, dated 12 September 1952

1.  The NCFE negotiations for a united Rumarian refugee organization appear to be culminating successfully. Although a number of differences have been resolved, a few controversial matters remain. These points have been discussed several times, both with the NCFE and the refugees, but are of such importance as to warrant special attention and emphasis at this moment.

2.  The most urgent problem, the one most likely to nullify the recent efforts and cause further difficulties, is that of General Fedescu. The problem is to find a position which the General will consider sufficiently imrortant for him and which we will consider sufficiently innocuous to ensure that he cannot interfere with the Committee. A majority of the refugees are in accord on the necessity for placing limitations of activity on the General. For operational reasons, we require such limitations. The existing good relations between the NCFE and the General should be utilised to persuade the General that a passive, honorary position is the only way to guard his health for, by implication, later action. He must be made to realise that he is not being shelved but is being saved. If he cannot be prevailed on to adopt this attitude, he will have to be told with complete frarkness that his obstructionian cannot be tolerated, that he will have to remain passive outside, rather than within, the new organisation or risk losing the assistance he now receives. The first method is the more desirable, and it is sucrested that the General's secretary, Earbu Niculescu, to incorried of the NCFE's intention and warned of the latter ster if his cooperation is not obtained in expediting the General's acceptance of a rassive role. Niculescu shoule be dealt with quite frankly and informed of the consequences, to his as well as to the General, if he does not cooperate.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

3. In regard to paragraph 4 of reference memorandum, the matter of the Council apparently has not seen discussed thoroughly with the refugees. The laportence of an organization for the masses of refugees, controlled by the Executive Committee of 16-17, unould not be underestimated. The workin: commissions proposed by Visoianu (European Federation Movement, Phi, rustications, etc.) should be drawn from the Council rather than from the refugees at large. Further, there are many refugees for whom the Commit:06 has no need, ror we at present, who desire to participate in a refugee organization. That the desire to belong to something is particularly strony among the youncer refugees, 1.c. those of potential operational value, is evidenced by the number who have affiliated with the Iron Guard, other fanatic organizations, student, and professional groups. Kerbership should be oper. to large nembers of rofugees (exclusive or hard-core Iron Guards, Communists, criminals, etc.), and should be manifested by membership cards. To strengti.en the sense of participation small annual ques could be required or subscription to this Committee rcwspaper (which would be suidized so that subscription cost would not be excessive). The formation of this Council is considered particularly worthwhile since it offers a way to draw worthy refugees from less cosiracle organisations and to develop their usefulness for the future.

4. With respect to the secret fund in the possession of Mr. Cretsianu of the kuwaarian hational Committee, we do not consider that an issue should be mace of the discursing and control of this money. Foth 1801enu and Cretzianu have agreed te account for the funds and to auditing of the books. It is rossicle that a finance cormittce, consisti of Cretzianu and one or two others, will be anointed in the new orgarisstion to handle the зив-sidies and to audit the secret fund.

5. Heports that Gafencu has developed an intransigent attitude toward the new committee have been received from several surces. As Mr. Pol beare is in Zurope and is a friend of Cafeucu's, it is suposted that he attempt to cotain again Dafencu's cooperation with the current negotiations.

6. It is requested that this memorandum be forwarded to the ICHE so that the information may be of immediate assistance in the negotiations planned for this week.

SUBJECT: Results of debriefing of Czech Defector

REFERENCE: Memo from Bob Joyce 17 Nov. 52, attaching State Cable from Frankfort #13

1. I am sure Rob Joyce will upon reflection not allow himself to be troubled by the remarks of one Czech defector to the State Department Mission in Germany.

2. These are the facts:

a. Radio Free Europe has been most careful in its handling of the subject of liberation. They have not in the past nor do they now allow anyone to speak on the air of "liberation now".

b. Attached for your information is a detailed guidance on this subject issued by Radio Free Europe - policy which governs all of their broadcasts.

c. As an example of how careful Radio Free Europe is on this subject, RFE did not use Mr. John Foster Dulles' recent controversial campaign speech on the subject of liberation because they believed that even though it was news and a statement made by a responsible American, it might be misinterpreted behind the Curtain.

3. I think that Radio Free Europe has maintained excellent discipline on this subject. You can imagine that it is under considerable pressure from Iron Curtain emigration to take the line of early rope for liberation in the prospect that in some way American public opinion and world opinion might be thus committed to a policy of liberation by armed forces.

4. I would be glad to have you show this memorandum to Mr. Joyce if you care to do so. He should know that everyone is constantly on the alert and carefully watching the problem as raises.

25 November 1952

SUBJECT: Talk with Mr. Robert Lang

1. I spent an hour and a quarter in New York on Friday, 14 November, with Mr. Robert Lang of Radio Free Europo. The major portion of this time was devoted to a briefing by Lang of the NCFE structure and the position which RFE occupies in it, including the philosophy of RFF operations. Iang gave an impressive performance and struck me on such short acquaintanco as an individual of ability, Judgment, and onergy.

2. Mr. Lang made quite a point of the fact that his operation inside NCFE io virtually independent. He intimated that he receives no guidance from the President or other officers and has exponded considerable effort in the past seoing to it that an iron curtain 18 kopt between FFE and the top command of ICFE. Ho said that if RFE had not developed and expanded according to a philosophy which it itself had originated, it would have got nowmare and would still be frustrated by what he kept refcrring to as the "old State Department line" as exemplified by the viows of Devitt loole, Fred Dolbeare, and others. He then pointed out that he had received virtually no guidance, policy or otherwise, from this organization. Also he claimed to suffer from lack of contact with us. lno stated that when ho saw Mr. Dulles a week or so ago, it was the first time he had talked to anyone in authority here in many a moon. As far as Hr. Fraden and company are concerned, he said that they dealt largely with Adiral tillor and his immediate staff. It was clear that ho would prefer to deal directly with Washington. He also feals inhibited by the fact that he has to cajolo Admiral iller into per- mission to como to viashington. ha cited as evidence an incident re- cently when he felt obliged to ask a friend in the State Department to intercode with Admiral Miller to permit him to come down hore for consultation.

3. There was nothing bitter or frustrated in r. Lang's re- marks. Rather he struck me as an individual who was discussing the facts of life, be Miat they may.

4. I told him that I would discuss with you the wisdom of having him como down here for a day some time in the next week or so

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, International Organisations Division

SUBJECT : Dr. J. H. Retinger

1. Please note and return to Mr. Dulles the attached letter from Dr. J. H. Retinger who has asked Mr. Dulles for an appointment during his visit in Washington between November 25 and 28. You will also note that Mr. Dulles does not propose to answer the letter nor (presumably) to grant the appointment. I am not sure whether you are familiar with the background on Retinger including our past difficulties with him. If you are not, I think it is important for you to have a look at the files which include numerous items of derogatory information concerning Retinger and his declared hostility toward the National Committee for Free Europe. We went to the mat with our British friends in what I believe proved to be a successful effort to have Retinger removed from the key position which he held on the so-called McMillan Committee. (You are aware of the fact that the british Service is now working with the McMillan Committee and in support of it.)

2. Retinger's position as Secretary General of the European Movement -- as evidenced by the letterhead -- is probably known to you. Because of our interest in this activity, it is important for you and the appropriate members of your staff to be fully on notice of Retinger's connection and past performance. I could not be very enthusiastic about or too hopeful for the production of genuinely constructive results -- in keeping with policies of the United States Government of any organization of which Retinger would be the Secretary General. To the extent that his loyalties can be determined, it is clear that they do not run toward the United States.

SUBJECT : Leland Stowe; I&S Approval of NCFE Request.

1. This memorandum will record the understanding arrived at in a conversation today with Colonel Edwards, Chief of I&S, and reported orally to Mr. Durkee by me. Admiral Miller telephoned me today with an urgent request that we give our authorization and approval to the use of Mr. Stowe for a further period of six months in the capacity of a consultant to IFE and not as a regular employee. This was the same basis on was finally approved for the first period of six months which is about to expire.

2. In discussing this matter with Colonel Edwards I refreshed his recollection as to certain features of the original arrangement, including the fact that Stowe is an extremely capable individual who has attracted other good people, notably Russell Hill, into the effort, and who has no serious security raps against him. (He is not regarded as a loyalty or security risk but rather as a source of possible embarrassment in view of certain earlier writings of his.) Admiral Miller informed me and I passed on to Colonel Edwards the fact that there have been no questions or flurries of any kind concerning Stowe and the further fact that he has been doing a very effective job. Colonel Edwards approved from a security standpoint the continuation of Mr. Stowe as a consultant to IFE for a further period of six months.

3. I requested Mr. Durkee to so advise Admiral Miller at the earliest possible moment. I assume he has done so.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Conversation with Mr. Jan Nowak

1. At your request, I had a conversation today with Mr. Jan Nowak, head of the Polish radio desk of RFE in Munich. I am sorry that you did not get to see him. Our conversation reminded me that our work is terribly important, which is a nice reminder on a busy afternoon.

2. I say "important" because Nowak reviewed with me the letters he had received from listeners in Poland and these, together with his own enormous enthusiasm for the work he is doing, reminded me that our long days in Washington have an effect on the lives and hopes of people far away. Nowak, who was in the Polish resistance during the war and who on one of his three escapes from Poland at one time spent several weeks in Switzerland where he had made contact with your representatives, later worked for the BBC and he pointed out that at no time during the war was he given to feel by the BBC the sense of responsibility and mission which he feels in his job in RFE. He said he was told when he was brought to RFE that the responsibility for the programs was his and that if at any time programs went on the air which were irresponsible, then he would lose his job. He says that when he has questions which he thinks might influence United States policy, he confers beforehand with Griffith and the Americans in Munich, and sometimes arguments ensue, but he feels, and I am certain he feels sincerely, that he has an equal share with Americans in a great effort to carry the truth back home..

3. I say "terribly" important because Nowak, like other exiles, wonders out loud how long our work can continue to have an impact. He is himself convinced that every Polish soldier is a potential ally of the west but he wonders, and makes his listener wonder, how long we can expect this sympathy among a rising generation for which the past is inexorably fading.

4. Nowak made one point which I am sure he intended for your ears, that he was afraid that "certain people in Germany" who had contacts into Poland might lead his friends behind the Curtain to

betray themselves unnecessarily and tragically. He said that he had heard that these people had promoted behind the Curtain a whispering campaign among the Poles at the time of the recent elections to the effect that the elections were to be postponed. He seemed to think tinis an unnecessary rick for those who took part in it. He also said that he had been approached by these same people who asked him to urge the Polos by broadcast to cross out the names of the Communist candidates when they voted. He learned only later, he said, that the system of voting at the last election was such that in order to cross out candidates it was necessary to step out of tac ballot box and do it in the open before witnesses. He had in any event refused such suggestions. I got the impression that he feels some of our people are a little immature.

5. I liked him. As I say, seeing his nate ne proud of what we are doing.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, International Organizations Division

SUBJECT: DD/P's Memorandum to you 30 October 1952 entitlod, "National Committee for Free Europe, RF, and Rolated Matters"

1. You will be interested to know, I am sure, that Hr. Wiener's friend,
   Mr. Georgescu, has recently been most helpf:1. Through his efforts and the
   cooperation of Jim Pekich of SE European Division, I believe that HCPE 18 on
   the threshold of a unified Rumanian National Council.

2. I'm in entire agreemont also with Mr. Georgescu's observation on
   the personnel sot-up within NCFE. As you know, Kr. Dolbeare is concerned
   about his role. He is the first to admit that his strength is ebbing, and
   that he should retire. I think it mist be agreed also that Mr. Holbeare has
   done a splendid job, a job that would have been, and will still be, difficult
   for a man in the prime of life.

I have discussed this problem in confidence with Francis B. Stevens.
As a result of my inquiries about a possible successor to Mr.. Dolbearo, Mr.
Stevens suggests that Mr. Nathaniel Penistone Davis is a person emirently
qualified to do this job. I would be interested in knowing whether Mr.
Wisner knows this man.

3. I believe also, Hr. Georgescu's misgivings about Mr. Yarrow aro woll-
   founded. In the last two months, Mr. Yarrow has taken an increasingly prom-
   inent position in Mr. Dolbeare's Division, as a result of Hr. Dolbeare's
   physical inability to do a full time job. Hr. Yarrow is blunt, and inclined
   to be dictatorial. He has a predilection for direct action in situations
   that rightly call for finesse and careful development. For these reasons,
   in addition to the fact that he is of hussian extraction and, speaks with a
   heavy accent, I am convinced that he should not replace Mr. Dolbeare. In
   my opinion, under the right leadership, Mr. Yarrow could continue to make a
   valuable contribution to NCFE's dealings with emigres as an administrator.

I believe that such a solution is politically possible, for NCFE
in this phase of its activities is going through a period of groping and
painful reorientation. I hope that the start we have made in working out a
re-statement and a re-direction of activities within livision of Emigre Re-
lations will provide a program of positive projects which will supply ammuni-
tion for psychological warfare, both behind the Iron Curtain and in the Free
World. Such a program will call for an efficient administrator versed in
exile affairs- a position for which Mr. Yarrow is well qualified. Under
the political leadership of a person of Fr. Cavis' caliber, for direct dealings
with endgres, I feel that the Division of knigre Relations will be able to
clear up present inefficiencies and contribute effectively to NCPE's over-all
mission.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Chief, International Organisation Division

SUBJECT:
National Committee for Free Europe,, and related matters.

1.  This memorandum is to inform you of a number of items which have recently come to my attention and to which I think you should give consideration and take necessary action. V. C. (Fica) Ceorgescu, who is an old Friend and a very helpful consultant of the Agency, came to see me the other evening and discussed certain aspects of ... Fica has been working on both sections of the Lumanians in an effort to bring them together, and I think that his criticism is, on the whole, constructive. He states that entirely apart from the question of factionalism among the Rumanian groups and other national groups, there is the greatest amount of inefficiency at the desk level of NCFE. This results from having too many politicians and diplomats in positions of authority and too few persons of any practical experience; too much time is consumed and too much of the general effort goes completely to waste as the result of endless political discussions, much of it entirely theoretical. It would be desirable to review the entire personnel set-up within NCFE at an early date and place in charge of the various desks individuals who are capable of administering their people and running a show. Such persons could be advised and assisted by the politicians and the diplomats, but they would have the responsibility for getting things done. Finally, Fica told me very confidentially that he thought Foltescu, who has never been strong, was getting weaker and weaker, and he voiced some misgivings about Pemide Yarrow. He said that he does not know Yarrow at all well, but has the impression from others that Yarrow is high-handed and dictatorial in his dealings and that his background is not particularly suitable for a person who is to hold a position of so much responsibility in dealing with Southeastern European nationals.

2.  I think I have already told you that Victor Rlesel, the writer of the hostile pieces which you brought to my attention, complained about the treatment that he received from Finis Farr, who he said had led him to believe that he was going to be called upon for advice and assistance to the Agency. There were no follow-ups and Liesel was miffed. Liesel also singled out for sharp attack Captain Giniger, who he said he believed was in a high place in CIA and who was a thoroughly incompetent and undesirable

With reference to your memorandum of October 15, 1952 concerning the desire of the Baltic Panels to change their names to the Committee for Free Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, respectively, I wish to inform you that the Department porcelvos no renson to oppose such a change.

It is suggested however, that ICPC insist that the new names for the Baltic Panels be precisely those montioned in your memorandum of October 15. It is our feeling that if the panels wore to be called National Committoos, for example, confusion might arise with respect to other organizations from these countries already in existence and the impression might be created that the committees are of greater political significance trap wo aish them to be.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECCIOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Crusade for Freedom

1. While in Detroit yesterday, I talked with Charles Moore, W10 is the Director of Public Relations for Ford Motor Company, and also with Henry Ford. I was merely paying a friendly call on Moore but he raised the matter of the Crusade rund asked Mr. Ford to come in and talk about it. They are both very unhappy with Mr. Walsh, who is Admiral Miller's man on the Crusade and whom Bler socured from the State Department, and I also cathored the general impression of dis- satisfaction with Miller and his whole effort - "If wo had known what kind of an outfit we were working with, we wouldn't have taken it over." On the other hand, both Hr. Ford and Moore said that they were goin; ahead full stean and intended to see the job through to the best of their ability".

2. I think there is no action to be taken hore and merely pass this on for your information, but it does bring to mind again what I think is growing evidence that the Crusade is more trouble than it is worth.

3. I think this ought to be tim last Crusade for Freedom and that we ougnt to give thought to alternatives. We are now taking etons to take Free Asia out of the Crusade next year, substituting a permanent fund-raising office in San Francisco, token donations from three Agency foundations, and making a serious attempt to obtain some money from Asian groups and contacts. Semo other cover is obviously needed and we are thinking in terms of the American Heritage Foundation or other possibilities that may occur. We should take similar steps for the National Committee for a Free Europe.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CHIEF, EE DIVISION
CHIEF, SE DIVISION
CHIEF, IO DIVISION

SUBJECT:
Attempts of persons outside the Agency to influence
Agency and State Department policy with respect to
National Committee for a Froo Europe

1.  I have had reports from Boveral sources that persone outside
    the Agency and outside the State Department have attempted to influence
    Agency operations arid State Department policy in respect to the National
    Committee for a Free Europe. Two of those persons, it is reported, are
    Carmel Offie and Maynard Barnos..

2.  To the extent that Mosers. Offle and Barnos are aware of our
    continuing relations with ICFE, their awareness constitutes a danger
    to our successful conduct of the operation. I therefore ask you and
    members of your Division to refrain from any contact with those gentle-
    men or with others who, by virtue of their suspicions or knowledge but
    without any official capacity whatever, are attempting to grind their
    personal axes through the Hational Committee for a Free Europe.

3.  I have also had reports from soveral sources that members of
    this. Agency who happen to hold strong personal views on the conduct of
    exile activities by NCFE have, in their direct relations with the
    exiles, encouraged the exiles to oppose NCFE decisions arvi policies.
    Please transmit to your respective staffs my strong aversion to this
    kind of in-fighting. I call your attention to the agreement signed
    by mysolf and Mr. Georgs Kennan of the State Department on 13 February
    1949, which reads in parts

"Exiles and/refugees will be referred to the New York
Committee/for all matters of an operational nature,
including the provision of support and facilities for
themselves and their activities."

The same memorandun states that "Certain operational activities
will not properly fall within the province of the liew York Committee" and
reserves these activities to this Agency, but these reserved operational
activities wore clearly not intended to embrace the encouragement of the
exiles to fight off decisions made by the Comittee as to "the provision
of support and facilities for themselves and their activities".

4.  Flease also convey to robers of your staff that I shall not
    tolerate furtner violations of the established policy est forth above.

5. Please also convey to members of your staff that I shall not tolerate further violations of the established policy set forth above.
   If there is any kind whatever for future reports, I am sure that you will all agree that we should resolve our differences inside the agency.

# Analysis of Memorandum by Mr. Creighton Scott

The following momorandum, I believe, discusste most of the points raised by Hr. Scott.

1. Scripte prepared in Munich are almost never reed by Americana before broadcast el though the goneral content of each broadcast is agreed upon in programming conferancos between the derican and axila statis. The reasons why the broadcasts are not read by Anoricans before they go on the air are as follow

a. Because the natural inclination of Americans is to change tho troadcasts, and such changes, RFE officials feal, are likely to leasen the "ganuino" quality of axile broad. casts for the listeners.

b. Because the exiles fool themselves to be patriots working for their countries, and the submission of scripts to Americana before they are broedcast would be regarded by the exiles as casting doubt upon their allegiance and fervor.

The American staff believes that it can exercise policy contral by suggestions during program discus:dons rather than by making dolo- tions and corrections in the scripts thamsolves.

2. During my trip to Europe in June, I asked Hr. w. E. Oriffith, Political Advisor for HEE, to institute the service of regularly translating the most sensitive ince broadcasts after the fact. He has complied with this request and CIA now receives Englisa trans- lations of Munich scripts within a month after broadcast. CIA also receives an immediate teletypo summary of all Munich broadcasts, as well as a weekly consolidated summary of all broadcasts. To provide for imediate English translation of all af programs after the fact would require an enormous staff of translators.

3. No doubt RFE has made the mistakes Er. Scott mentions in connection with the items about the weakness of the Iron Curtain and the ease of crossing it, and the Czechoslovakian curroney devaluation. On the first point, Mr. Scott's dates are in error, for RFE did not go on the air until July, 1950. Assuming that he means that such broadcasts were made from tant dato until April 1951, it smuld be noted that this was the very beginning of Res when all of its broad- casts originated in New York. Such troadcasts certainly are not being continued. I assume they were the result of inexperience. The


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

will be discontinued when I ces out of existence, and they should not be reestablished. You will remember that at the hearingo wion considered a 1253 get, the officials of NCFT asked for $500,000 to cover the expected Loss of such privileges and because we felt that this was unjustified, we asked and wore granted the right to retain this senoy in the CIA rezerve ponding further juotification.

5. Mr. Scott's omplaint that the Information Service of has been too expensive anvi naive is probably correct. In part this is the result of CIA's inability, for justifiable security rensons, to make information on a Lerge scale availalio to RVE. However, the Information Service is being reorganized. There is reason to boliove that excellent professional novecon, such as Russell Hill and Ed Chamberleyne will provide the competence necessary for an increase in officiency.

6. In sum, Ar. Scott's criticisms and complaints seen a mixture of fact and fiction aminated by a porconal antagonism. His le but one of a minber of such attacks by forma amployous. Our own approach to Radio Free Europe should be not so mich an assessment of past success and failures, as an exacination of future opportunities. A powerful instrument has boen ereated, in the main successfully, in an incredibly short time. Whero it soos from here, giving due consideration to criticdan such as Scots, toms to as to be our priority task.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, International Organizations Division

SUBJECT: President's Committee on Immigration and Naturalization

1. The attached memorandum, greatly modified in form by the General Counsel of NCFE, is to be presented tomorrow afternoon at an open hearing of the President's Committee which is conducting hearings on the McCarran Bill.

2. I was informed of this proposed presentation on Friday afternoon, October 17. I obtained the attached from Mr. Greenlea, NCFE General Counsel, today. NCFE does not know that Mr. Greenlea has been in touch with us and should not know.

3. I suggest that you review, with Mr. Wisnor, whether NCFE should make such a presentation. In essence, the presentation is an attack on the McCarran Bill. I suggest that, perhaps, NCFE should not testify for two reasons:

a. This is close to a clear example of a tax exempt charitable organization, attempting to influence legislation and;

b. The political implications are liable to be an embarrassment for CIA.

4. Apparently, NCFE is making this presentation in the hopes of receiving wide publicity so they will be in a position to say to the emigrees with whom they deal, "look what we are trying to do for you."

5. I urge your rapid concern, for the presentation is due to be made tomorrow afternoon.

The National Committee for a Free Surope, Inc., was formed in 1949 when a group of private citizens joined together for positive action against Soviet enslavement. It concentrates its efforts on the 100 million Contral and Eastern Europeans today living undor inhuman conditions of force and fear. This tyranny, imposed by Soviet Russia in flagrant violation of her solemn guarantees, procludes the enduring world peace desired by free men overywhere. The National Committee for a Free Europe is the American peoples' answer to the Kromlin's despotic rule.

The Committee seekat:

(1) To pierce the Iron Curtain with messages of moral and practical value through the facilities of Radio Free Europe, thus taking the fight to the enemies' camps

(2) To build for the future by educating young refugoes from Communism through the Mid-European Studies Center hore in the United States, and the Free Ruropeen University in Exile in Strasbourg, France. In this manner we attempt to preserve the cultural heritage of the past which the enemy seeks to destroy:

(3) To develop political unity and a dynamio platform of aims and principles among the exile groups through the Division of Exile Relations,

(4) To assemble, analyze and distribute knowledge about ourrent conditions in the captive area;

(5) To create active public support, both moral and material, for these activities.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

Vital to the work and well being of the National Committee for a Free Europe are its approximately two thousand olion Associates. 60 percent of these eliens aro in Europe, with the rost residing either temporarily or permanently in the United Statos. At the present time over one hundred of those aliens residing here faco imminont deportation.

It might be inserted parenthetically at this point that all of these aliers presently faoing deportation have attempted to remain within the spirit and the letter of the law, but because of the absurdities of the law have been forced into the position of being wilful violators of it. We do not sponk, either now or et any point in this disoussion, about evadors of, or fugitives from, justice, but shall only refer to individuals of good feith, attempting to the best of their ability to conform to the rules and regulations of the country which they believe, often mistakenly, to be the refuge of the afflicted.

At various times during the history of our orgenization it has been necessary for the National Committee or its subsidiaries to ask certain aliens with particular talents to come to the United States on extremoly short notice. They were, of course, admitted as visitors. After these lions had arrived in the United States, they wero immediately faced with the problem of attempting in some menner to regularise their status here so that trips back and forth from Europe for visa re-newal purposes would not be necessitated.. Under the, present immigration law the only possibility of obtaining such romuterization was by having


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

- 3-

the alien apply at an American Consulate in Canada, await the issuance
of a visa number, and then having the alien personally pick up the visa
at the appropriate consulato. This prooeduro usually took from a year
to 18 months. But this moda of regulartenston-will conso under the new
law, sincs aliens will not be admitted into the United States from Canada
without having first complotod certain residential requirements thoro..

The only manner of safoguerding, the residence of an alien
visitor in the United States at prosont is to attempt to got unlimited
extensions of his visitor's vise. This is of course impossible. Tho
allen finds himself, therefore, in the position of being doporteble to
the country from which he cane, and in most casce after having stayed in
the United States for over a year, the respective governments will rofuse
him pormission to return. In the end the allon finds himself in a pos1-
tion worse than the one which he enjoyed while residing in a Displaced
Persons camp in Germany.

Students supported by our Bild-European Studies Contor find them-
selves in an oven more embarrassing position. They are allowed to come
to the United States as students providing their re-entry pormits to the
countries from which they come are still valid. Any student who comes
to take advantage of our scholarshipe comes for at least a period of
from two to four years and is therefore unable to maintain his residence
abroad and keer his scholarship at the same time. They soon arrive at
the point where they cannot return to Europe, cannot continue their studios
here, and are constantly harrassed by officers of the Imigration Service.

Those students studying at our Free Europe University in Exile in Strasbourg


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

- 4 -

cannot come to the United States to continuo thoir studies at graduate
schools hore, beonuse most of then aro chargeablo-be-heavily oversub-
soribed quotas.

Our work here in the National Committee for a Froo Europe is
essentially payohological. Our ansoolatce in Radio Free Europe, the
Division of Exile kolations, etc., ornnot do officient, offootive or
productivo work when they are constantly betne harrassed by officials
of the Imalpration Service. Then their stay-in-the United States in_on
a day to day besis they cannot devote their full energies to the work
for which they came to this country, while it to brus-that most of them
intend to return to the country of their origin whon Communist domination
is overthrown there, they must have nome assurance that they con remain
peacefully hero until-thet moment. Thoroforo, it would soon appropriate
that sose provision be made in the immigration, lows that students and
temporary visitors in the United Stated be allowed to adjust their stetus
to that of temporary, if not pormanont, rosidence in the United States.

Another aspect of the inw which should be-considered-10-tho
Mony of the exile leaders of various Iron Curtain countrios
woro admissable to the United Statos undor the Displaced Persons Aot of
1948 as amended. However, when asked by the Immalgration authorities
whether they intended te remain in the United States tomporarily or por-
manently, they answered in all honosty that they intended to remain here
cnly until their own ocuntries had been liberated from the yoke of Con-
munist tyranny.
Of course, by their own admission they were thorofore
automatically barred from adjusting their status from that of temporary
visitor to permanent resident. In-tho.case of our student asscolates,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

- 5 -

they are obliged by the Committee as a requisite to receiving a scholar-ship, to sign a statement agreeing to return to the country of their origin when liberation comes so that their training will be of direct help in the cause of building a free world. It is indeed unfortunate that both the present law and the forthcoming one makes no provision for political refugees except in the once of those individuals who are admitted to the United States under diplomatic standing and subsequent-ly be the service of their government.

At the present moment individuals awaiting adjustment under this particular section of the ... law are in an extremely precarious position. All of them have a lifetime of political activity behind them, and therefore the administrative delay in processing their applications, completing investigations, etc., has been interminable. Now, most of them are receiving notices from the Department of Justice stating that since their applications have not been processed within the time limit, they are now eligible for deportation proceedings which will be effected forthwith.

Both the present and the future immigration laws make no provision for administrative discretion in the enforcement of the deportation laws. Should the local commissioner be allowed to use his discretionary powers in the matter of deporting individuals such as those discussed, the problem in great part would be cleared up.

The national quotes system is completely out of accord with present worldwide conditions. Almost all of the Iron Curtain countries, with the possible exceptions of Czechoslovakia and Poland, have annual


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 59

- 6 -

quotas of only 100, and those quotas are almost all oversubsoribed to the year 2000. Should the mortgagos laid on those quotes by the Dispiaced Persons hot be removed, or if Eungarians, for example, were able to borrow from the British quota, we should be able to bring to the United States meny allons possessing particular skills whose services aro urgently needed by this organization. Many of our allone are highly skilled technical, professional, medioal or scientifia men whose treining, expor-lonce and ability would most certainly be prospectively beneficial to the United Statoo.

It is because of the heavily ovorsubsoribed condition of the quotes of Hungary, Bulgaria, oto., that most of the applications for visas, nede as long as two years ago in American Consulatos in Canada, are being returned unprocessed, with the notation that no nation can be taken on their application due to the imminent approach of the offective dato of the new law.

Neither the presont 1ms, nor the new law makes proper provision for Displaced forsons who are bone fide visitors to the United States. None of those people have passports from their am countries, sinco all of them have rejected the political party presently holding sway thero. As a result they are traveling on French, Goraan, or other free country affidavits of identity or travel documents. Before a visa can be extended under the law, the travel documents end ro-entry paramite must be valid for a period of sixty days beyond the date of application. These countries will not extend these doouments since the bearers are not nationals of the issuin country. This, in effect, means that theso visitors can only


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

- 7 -

remain for a period of from six to nine months, and then must return to
Europe, oftentimes without being able to complete the work for which they
came.

Finally, it would seem that some provision could be made for
the rapid processing of the visas of both prospective immigrants and pros-
pective visitors so that in case of necessity an alien can be brought
quickly to the United States without the usual two year delay.

Generally speaking, if some drastic changes are not made in
the Immigration laws at the earliest possible moment, we can foresee the
virtual disbanding the National Councils Division of this organization,
and a serious curtailment of the quality of the broadcasts from Radio
Free Europe, and, although it is not à-propos to the present matter, we
should like to point out that these broadcasts are making a terrific im-
pact behind the Iron Curtain. One has only to read the virulent attacks
against our organization printed in the Communist press all over the world
to be assured of their effectiveness. The propaganda value to the Com-
munist cause of the mass deportations now being planned of these well-known
exiles is of course immeasurable.

When Public Law 414 was being debated in the Congress, it was
submitted that the present Immigration and Nationality Act was one riddled
with inconsistencies and completely engulfed in "red tape." We respect-
fully submit that the forthcoming law is full of even more inconsistencies,
is completely unaware of present world conditions, will in effect stop all
immigration except from those countries which are socially acceptable, and
will create an impassible labyrinth of restrictive red tape.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Maynard Barnes and Cumel Offie

1. In conversation the other day you asked me through what channel Maynard Barnes and Cumel Offio were stating their opinions on the matter of NCFE's request to move the administrative headquarters of the exile countries from Washington to New York, and who was listening to Barnes and Offio.

2. The channel seems to be the Southeastern European Division and in particular Colonel Yatsevitch, SE/QPP. The Southeastern European Division maintains an extremely skeptical view of NCFE activities in the exile field and has gone to considerable trouble, through exiles as well as through Barnes and Offle, to create the greatest possible objection not only to the recent move of the exile but to NCFE in general. I am attaching an article by Edgar A. Mowrer which was written at the behest of Mr. Offie and was originally intended to be the first of a series. We have been successful in having the series idea dropped.

3. While I believe that there is some justification in the points the EE Division continually makes about the exile record of the New York Committee, I think the inter-governmental squabble which is aroused by the Division's repeated attempts to use exiles, members of the State Department, and others as a sounding board for its own lack of sympathy with NCFE makes it difficult for the National Committee to fulfill its charter and for CIA to control day-to-day operations without interference from the State Department and others from outside the Agency.

4. I suggest that you send the attached memorandum to the Chiefs of EE, SE and IO. It is worded in such a manner that it will not reveal this reference.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CHIEF, IO

FROM: Chief, ROM/OIS

SUBJECT: Exchange of Intelligence Information between the NCFS and the DD/P Offices

1.  The National Committee for a Free Europe is the reservoir of a great wealth of intelligence information, particularly in the field of psychological warfare. A four-day survey of the NCFS conducted by an OIS case officer indicated that three NCFS components - the Research and Publications Service, the Mid-European Studios Center, and the Radio Free Europe - can make a very valuable contribution to the operational intelligence required by the DD/P offices.

2.  It is the purpose of this memorandum to suggest a procedure for the most effective use of the NCFS intelligence potential. The most practical approach seems to be as follows:

a. At this time it does not appear necessary to establish a continuous flow of raw and finished intelligence from the NCFE to the DD/P offices. Rather, we would like to use NCFE facilities whenever individual cases indicate that such action is advisable.

b. We would like to maintain a direct relationship with the NCFS for the purpose of enlisting its support in the work on our individual cases. When the nature of the case indicates that the NCFE can make a valuable contribution to it, we could make arrangements through the Chief of IO/TONIC, to make direct contact with one of the security-cleared NCFE officers. A permanently-designated OIS case officer (A. Snatton and/or H. Knoepfmacher) would then proceed to New York to discuss the substantive research problems in the NCFA and reach an agreement on the scope of NCFS. support.

3.  It is recognised that the final authority on all contacts with the NCFS rests with the Chief of IC/TONIC, and that the latter may direct and limit such contacts whenever he desires.

4. We suggest that, for the purpose of meeting security require- ments, the two OIS case officers assigned to NCP liaison be given permanent cover which would be arranged by the NCP Personnel Officer and the Chief of IO/TONIC.

We are, thoraforo, prepared to provide such intelligence research support to the NCFE as may be given within security laite and our inhour capa- bilitics. The requests for inteliigence support from the NCPE would be channeled to R31/O13 through the Chief of IO/TONIC.

6. Our proposals contained in this momorandun have beon discussed with the Chief of IO/TONIC and an understanding has been reached on all points covered. It is requested that the suggested procedure be approved.

SUBJECT: Survey of the National Committee for a Free Europe

1. This memorandum serves to inform you of a four-day survey made of the National Committee for a Free Europe by Alexander Chatton of ROM/OIS. The survey has uncovered a great wealth of information, contained both in raw files and finished reports, which is of operational intelligence interest. We are now making arrangements, through the IO Division, for continuing access to the NCFF files and for direct liaison with the NCFF Staff.

2. In the course of his conversation with Shatton, the President of the NCFE (Admiral Harold Piller) expressed concern over the fact that he had not been notified of Shatton's arrival and stated that he does not look with favor at CIA individuals working in the NCFE without his knowledge. Although Shatton informed him that his visit had been cleared with the IO Division, Admiral Miller remained somewhat unconvinced that the arrangements had properly been made. I suggest that this misunderstanding be brought to the attention of the DD/P, so that he may be informed of the facts in the event the matter is brought up by Admiral Miller in his contacts with the DCI and the DDCI.

3. Mr. Shatton's visit to the NCFE headquarters took place on 16, 17, 18 and 19 September.

SUBJECT: National Committee for Free Europe's Request for
Funds to Build a Gymnasium at the Free University-
in-Exile; Reclamer of Admiral Miller.

1. I believe that I told Mr. Braden last evening of the tolo-
   phone call which I had received from Admiral Miller and of what I
   had said in response to his request for funds to build the gymnasium.
   I want to make it clear that I offered him no specific encouragement,
   and confined my remarks to a statement that if he wished to draw up
   a proper application we would study it very carefully. I told him
   that this seemed to us an unnecessary expense and one which I would
   find difficult to defend with the Director in light of our present
   economy drive.

2. I should greatly appreciate a thorough staff job being
   done on this matter to relieve mo of the necessity of thinking up
   all of the arguments pro and con, especially the latter. will some-
   one please dig up in the Congressional Records the speechos mado
   during the last session of Congress in condemnation of the State De-
   partment's lavish approach to the educational and cultural exchange
   program? If we were ever forced to defend this Free. University
   program, I think we would be extremely vulnerable on the score of
   having spent $50,000 for a gymnasium or anything like it. This 18
   the icing on the cake and has the sound of being definitoly in the
   lumry category. There is also the very questionable wisdom of our
   spending additional money on "permanent plant", when we cannot be
   sure how long we will be able to continue our support of this enter-
   prise, nor for that matter how long the present flow of student
   material will continue.

3. Please let us sharpen up our thinking and our pencils
   as well. In the final analysis I shall probably have to veto this
   proposition, and will certainly do so unless it is much more con-
   vincingly supported than heretofore. However, I would like some

SUBJECT: Request for Budget Revision for NCFE

REFERENCE: Memo to DD/A and DD/P from Comptroller 13 Sept. 52

1. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of the subject memorandum requesting a budget revision for NCFA are explained in the supporting data attached to that memorandum. Items totaling $78,343 to be released from the reserve held by CIA, summarized in those paragraphs, are for material support of substantive operations already approved. Release of these items to NCFA is concurred in by International Organizations Division. It is recommended that the sum of $78,343 be released to NCFA.

2. The item in paragraph 3, i.e. $60,000 for nine months' operating expenses from July 1952 through March 1953 for the International Center of Free Trade Unionists in Exile, Paris, is concurred in by the IO Division. The reason for its concurrence is as follows:

a. Support in the amount of $71,000 for the International Center of Free Trade Unionists in Exile through NCFA was undertaken by a memorandum for the DD/P dated 1 September 1951, Lewis S. Thompson, Chief, Special Projects, OPC.

b. In early June 1952, the matter of continuing support for the ICFTU in Exile was reviewed by the DDCI, Admiral Miller and Mr. Braden. It was decided that the ICFTU in Exile would continue to be subsidized in the amount of $60,000 for a nine months' period, running from July 1952 through March 1953.

3. A cable, IN-34233, from Mr. Braden indicates the Chief of the Paris Station and Mr. Braden have discussed the possibility of ending relations with the ICFTU in Exile. Mr. Braden indicates he wishes to take up this matter with the DDCI on his return.

4. It is therefore recommended that the sum of $60,000 be released to NCFE to enable them to continue payments as already agreed. If the support for the ICFTW in Exile should be terminated, funds remaining in NCFE's hands can be applied to other proposed activities now held for justification by CIA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CHIEF, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DIVISION

ATTENTION: Mr. W. P. Burkeo, Chief, IO/TONIC

SUBJECT: Refugee Stipendiaries of NCFE

REFERENCE: Secret Memo dtd 12 August 1952 from Chief, IO/TONIC, to Chief, SE, Subject: List of Stipendiaries of NCFE.

1. In compliance with your request of 12 August, the referenced memorandum was circulated to the various interested branches of SE Division. Of the thirteen Rumanians listed as stipendiaries of NCFE, only one, Mr. Frutus Coste, is on the payroll of SE Division. However, it has been our understanding that Mr. Coste has received no stipend since December, 1951. We would appreciate a further check on the status of Mr. Coste with respect to his reported stipend. No other duplications were reported.

2. It is requested that in addition to the referenced list of stipendiaries, IO Division obtain from the NCFE and RFE a list of all refugee employees from within the SE area (Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia) who may be employed in any capacity, with their salaries and job titles. Such information has not been available to the interested branches in the past, but experience has shown that the availability of this data on a current basis would be most helpful to the responsible case officers.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CHIEF, PSYCHOLOGICAL STAFF DIVISION

ATTENTION: Mr. E. J. Harrison, PT Evaluation

SUBJECT: IPTONIC Use of PY Guidance Papers

1. In discussing this subject, the following facts of DNIC operations should be kept in view:

a. DNIC prepares its own daily guidance papers, written by a special staff which has at its disposal a European-wide news-gathering apparatus.

b. State Department overnight policy guidances are regularly delivered to TONIC on the day of issue.

2. Guidance papers from PY are dispatched as soon as they are received. For instance, Special Guidance on Bacteriological Warfare, dated August 7, 1952, and Weekly Propaganda Guidance No. 9, dated August 8, 1952, were sent on August 11.

3. The value of PY guidance papers for PTMC was taken up with TOMIC officials last May. Their observations are contained in the following quotations from their letters to this Division:

a. The Chief Programming Official wrote:

"We have received several of these papers in the past couple of months. They are extremely useful for the following reasons:

a. They set forth clearly U. S. policy on one issue or another;

b. They occasionally report thinking in quarters from which we hear nothing directly;

c. They usually contain pertinent quotations of expression of views by the enemy which we can make use of (both published and other cources, such as interrogatories).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

SECRET

ad down for propaganda addressed to other
audience than ours (other than central and
eastern Europe).

On the other hand, when these papers deal with our
targets, they sometime reveal a divergence from
our thinking and our points of view. Where this is
known to the Post that they have in mind black, we'lle
be dealin' in white. But the difference can be legitimate. But
even so, we find proposals that seem to us illogical,
and now and then extremely unwise."

b. The President of the organization wrote:

"You enclosed a paper giving additional guidance material
for propaganda countering Communist BW charges. All the
lines therein suggested have been successively used by us
since February 25 or thereabouts when the topic first
arose.

"Papers of this kind are of great use, provided they arrive
promptly. By promptly is meant, either in anticipation of
an event, or an expression of views on the day the event
occurs."

c. The Deputy Director, Radio, wrote:

"With regard to the paper (Prop-103, dated 23 March 1952)
that you enclosed, I checked Bob's department and they
advise that from the beginning we have made the points
specified in 6(a)3 and 5, 6(b)2, 9(a)1 and 2, 9(d), 9(e), 10.

"As a matter of information, to our particular audiences we
may, instead of 6(b)l, that the Soviet Union is trying to
persuade the leaders of German heavy industry, militarists,
and ex-Nazis to go into partnership with it; and instead of
6(c) that the prohibition of alliances is fraudulent, Moscow
intending, as in August 1939, to ally itself with a reaction-
ary Germany against our peoples. Again to our audiences, we
say instead of 9(a)2 that the German problem can be solved,
and that the Western powers are attempting to solve it in
the interest of the security of our audiences. We are glad
to see that our line parallels that laid down in 9(d) and (e)."

h. A fair summary of the use of FY guidance papers for RFE is as
follows:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

a. They are useful insofar as they contain ideas that have not occurred to TONIC's own people or in reference to events that are not a matter of public knowledge.

b. In most cases the guidance papers arrive so late that DMC is already engaged in treating the next stage in the development of the propaganda theme suggested.

c. As PY guidance papers, therefore, are at the moment another contribution to the thinking of TONIC officials, it is not possible to point to specific uses of the material suggested.

d. To be most useful, propaganda guidance from PY should treat the development of special themes that have a specific relation to precise U. S. Government operations and objectives aside from gonoral U. S. foreim policy goals. To be most useful to RFE, such guidance should be developed over a period of time in anticipation of the actual facts or operations making up such programs.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, IO Division

SUBJECT: Current V. S. Attempt to form a Unified Rumanian Refugee Organization

REFERENCE: Memorandum to Chief, IO Division, Subject: SE Division Plan for Rumanian Emigre Organization, dated 28 May 1952

1. In view of the considerable length of time since NCFE opened negotiations for Rumanian refugee unity and subsequent developments, a reappraisal of the situation and a delineation of final action are required.

2. It is evident that expression of NCFE interest in the Council of Political Parties (actually it has been directed primarily toward the National Peasant Party) has had the desired effect on the two refugee groups in the United States, by raising the specter of a third force developing and being recognized by the Americans. It has also made the King aware of the seriousness with which the Americans regard the division between the two groups. Further, it has incited the Iron Guard to adopt a "democratic" facade in the hope, perhaps, of fitting eventually into the resulting organization. However, in spite of the success of the maneuver, further encouragement of the CoPP and the NNI could well prove dangerous to our overall objective of unifying the refugees, by adding fuel to their differences.

3. Careful consideration has been given to the various worthwhile proposals and counter proposals which were advanced in the course of the recent discussions. It is hoped, in this connection, that the NCFE has made it entirely clear to all the participants that this series of discussions was undertaken purely to explore the possibilities for agreement in concert with the refugees themselves, and that after hearing all sides of the question, the NCFE will present for their consideration a "package" proposal, on the basis of which final agreement should be reached. It is believed that the revision of the original plan, set forth below and embodying certain features which have developed in the course of the last three months, can provide a solution acceptable both to this organization and to the refugees. Operational considerations, the desirability of maintaining a reasonable degree of control, the necessity for taking into account the refugee concept of democratic procedures, as well as the firm stand on size taken by the Rumanian National Committee, these are all important factors affecting the problem. The final organization should be small enough to control, sufficiently selective to attract prominent exiles, inclusive enough to contain the rank and file, and of an optimum size to carry out its functions effectively.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 76

4. An organizational form of a large passive Council, to which all Rumanians who meet certain qualifications could belong, but with all action vested in a small Executive Committee, offers a practical way to catiafy both U. E. and refugee requirements. The name of this overall organization should be the "Rumanian National Committee" since tids would provide a sunse of contimity and would facilitate acceptance of the proposal by Vicolanu and the King. It would be formed by an expansion of the present Rumanian National Committee into the Executive Committee of approximately twenty persons. Hembership in the Council would be extended to the rank and file by means of letters announcing the new organization and inviting perticipation. The "Council" of the Rhianian National Committee would include mimbore from all comtries and would not meet in session. Radoscu should be designated honorary president of the Council. The Executivo Committee would be the functional unit of the organization. It would appoint sub-commionions and proupe to perform the work of the Committee and designate representativos of the Romanian liational Committee at various refugee centers in Europe, South America, and the Near East. A membership card would be issued to all wno affiliate with the Council. Members of cxtremist proupo would be excluded in principle from manbership in the Romanian National Connlttce, except in certain cases passed upon by the Committoo and accepted by us. A newspaper would be published and distributed in liberal quantities.

5. The Executive Committee headquarters would be in New York City and work in conjunction with the NCFE and representatives of CIA. It is recommended that the position of chairman of the Executive Commalttee bo held for a term of one year, elective by members of this committee only. Ita nombers should bel

6. As the first step in achieving the organization outlined above, it ia suggested that the NCFE reply to Visoienu'a nemc expressing appre- clation and inviting him to a discussion of his proposal. At this meeting, the NCFE should present the idoas outlined in paragraph h as the American view of the compromise which, after careful study, appears to offer the best possible solution. In the discussion, the lNCID should indicate that this plan is the result of much thought by interested groupa after dis- cuasions with many refugees, that it has attempted to aid the refugees because of its interest in them and their country's welfare, and that it 18 prepared to support a Rumanian refugee orgadzation in a number of ways. Visolanu should be invited to recommand the people whom he considers desirable for the Executive Committee. He will have been briefed ty CIA prior to the meeting and will propose the same list generally as that in pararaph 5. The NCFE should then request Visoianu's cooperation and active participation in forming an organization along the lines suggested in para- graphs 4 and 5. It will swgest that Vicolanu, Fore and Crihan work with Cafencu, Chilesan and Coste for this purpose. Each of these gentlemon should be approached by CIA and NCFE prior to the opening contact meeting of the group. If any substitutions are made in the participants, CIA should be consulted prior to the time arrangements are completed. After this group has worked cut details of the organization and consulted with the others suggested for the Executive Committee, the NCFE will taske Invitations to a general meeting of this Committee and will ancist in getting the other organisational details underway. Sub-com18sions should be established. imnectately, using the refuzoes who have been participating in the recent NCFE discussions. Arrangements will be made for Visoianu and Cafenou and an additional delegation to be named later, to co to England to inform the King of the agreements reached and the details of the new organization.

7. During this phase of activity, it is recommended that someone from this Divinion be assigned on TUI in New York to work closely with the NCFE and advise on any necessary changes. CIA will contact certain refugees to ensure their cooperation prior to the initiation of this phase of activ- 1ty.

8. This plan has been coordinated with the Department of State. It is requested that the details be forwarded to the ICFE and a meeting arranged to discuss the implementation.

SUBJECT:
11 September 1952.

Conversation with Admiral H. B. Miller on Wednesday, the 10th of September.

The following is a memorandum of my conversation with Admiral Miller in New York on Wednesday, September 10th. I would like to preface this account with the observation that Admiral Miller seems to be in a highly emotional state and generally suspicious of those around him.

(1) Larry deNouſville

Admiral Miller reported his meetings with Larry deNeuville in Paris and indicated a difference in his projected use of Larry deNeuſville and that onvisaged by deNeufville, which Admiral Miller presumed represented CIA's interests. Miller proposes to use deNeufviile as one of a three man brain trust, one of whom is Louis Gallantier and the other is still unnamed. He mentioned that he had originally considered deNouſville as an aide in administrative matters but had been informed that deNeufville was not equipped for such duties.

(2) VOA

Admiral Miller indicated that RFE was having difficulties with VOA, especially with the new Information Intelligence Unit created by the State Department, under the direction of Donald Shea, to provide information for VOA's broadcasts to the Iron Curtain countries. Those difficulties included the preventing of RFE's information people from interviewing escapees.

(3) Information Service - Leland Stowe

Admiral Miller indicated that he was more than satisfied with Leland Stowe's activities, and that with the exception of RFE correspondents in London and Paris, they were satisfied with present personnel. He also stated that Russell Hill had become RFE correspondent in Germany. He further indicated that he will make every effort to keep Leland Stowe on after the expiration of the present six-month consultative contract.

(4) Father Horlion

Admiral Miller stated that he had conferences with Monsignor Cardini who stated that Father Horlion's information was not reliable. Admiral Miller reported that McDonald, the RFE correspondent in Rome, held the same view. Admiral Miller exhibited some suspicion of the actions of Mr. Delbeare in trying to sell him the matter of Father Horlion and Anna Brady, but stated if that was what Mr. Dulles wanted, that was all right with him.

(5) Crusade for Freedom

Admiral Miller indicated he was going to give two days a week to the Crusade for Freedom.

1. Mr. Phenix when he was recently here advised me that the Board of NCFE desired to change its name from "National Committee for a Free Europe, Inc." to "Free Europe Committee." The purpose of this was to avoid confusion with the multitude of "national committees" for various purposes, some of them subversive.

2. This proposed change was discussed at the morning meeting with the Director and Deputies and no objection was found if the Committee really wanted to do it. I suggest that C/IO confirm this to Phonix as they want to set the legal steps in motion.

1. Attached hereto is Admiral Miller's answer on behalf of NCFE to numerous requests for personnel records of NCFE in order to provide CIA with basic information about this project.

2. In view of NCFE's reticence to provide us with such basic information, Mr. Braden and I have discussed the possibility of whether we could effectively perform a liaison function here for you without such information, and we are agreed that we cannot. As you know, it is not our purpose to use this information to harrass people in New York or to quibble about salaries or details of assignments. We do think that the only way CIA can perform its responsibility toward NCFE is to keep itself fully informed in every field of NCFE's activity, and that knowing which employees are doing what is essential information.

3. You suggested at the FEC meeting on 8 August that you might be able to give us a hand in our effort to get this information.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

1. It is understood by Sponsor and the Fund that activities of the Fund will be conducted in accordance with the following principles:

a. The fund will present to the Sponsor on or before 1 May of each year a proposed program and financial budget for the fiscal year beginning on 1 July. In general, this presentation will include detail comparable to other Sponsor budget presentations and, of course, must include as a minimum sufficient information to enable the Sponsor to analyze the program from both a budgetary and policy viewpoint.

b. After subjecting the program and budget to normal Sponsor review and analysis, the Sponsor will adviso the Fund as to the specific activities of the over-all program which the Sponsor desires to support, and as to specific amounts approved for expenditure in connection with each Fund division, including a small General Administration Contingency Fund which can be used at the discretion of the Fund for minor unforeseen requirements of any division. Exceptions, limitations, or other special provisions will be stipulated where appropriate. The Fund will undertake major activities other than those approved in its annual program only when mutually agreed by the Sponsor and the Fund. Transfer of funds from one Fund division to another division will not be made except by prior mutual agreement of the Sponsor and the Fund.

c. A reasonable reserve fund will be held by Sponsor and provided for in the budget to take care of unforeseen emergencies or contemplated activities which have not been sufficiently developed to permit detailed budgetary planning. Releases will be made from this fund to the Fund as appropriate upon presentation of proper justification to the Sponsor.

d. The Fund will furnish the Sponsor with such regular financial reports reflecting its operations as may be necessary to enable the Sponsor to properly account for the Fund expenditures. The Fund will also furnish the Sponsor with copies of audit reports made to the Fund by the firm of Certified Public Accountants employed for that purpose by the Fund with the approval of the Sponsor.

e. In order that the Fund may have available at all times sufficient net liquid assets to provide for liabilities which would exist in the event unforeseen liquidation became necessary, Sponsor will provide the Fund with an adequate liquidation reserve which will be held by the Foundation and invested in United States Government obligations of a readily convertible variety mutually agreed by Sponsor and the Fund. This reserve will be made available to the Fund as required, to be used only for the purposes of liquidation as mutually agreed by Sponsor and the Fund.

f. In case of liquidation, the assets of the Fund remaining after payment and discharge of all debts and liabilities of the corporation shall, as required by the Fund by-laws, be distributed "to such tax-exempt charitable organizations as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, in its discretion," but it is understood that the Fund will, in fact, designate the tax-exempt charitable corporation known as "The 1848 Foundation" as the recipient of such net assets.

g. The Sponsor will provide the Fund with appropriate guidance and the Fund, to the extent it is apprised thereof, will insure that all Fund activities are conducted in a manner consistent with U.S. Government policy and the Sponsor policy and mission. It is more- over recognized that developments unforeseen at the time of the approval by the Sponsor of any annual program may require the termination thereof, or any portions thereof, at any time by the Fund either at its own instance or at the request of the Sponsor.

h. The Fund will accept restricted gifts from private donors, other than Crusade for Freedom, Inc., only when mutually agreed by the Fund and the Sponsor.

i. The Fund may submit budgetary revisions either quarterly or whenever proposal new activities or unforeseen developments require a significant change in approved budgets.

j. Within the limits of approved budgets, the Fund will requisition funds from the Sponsor quarterly unless unanticipated requirements necessitate interim requisitions.

k. To promote their common security interest, the Sponsor will keep the Fund continuously advised as to desirable security procedures and the Fund will be free to request specific security guidance from the Sponsor at any time. The Fund will not elect or appoint a director, officer, key executive or any other person who will have knowledge of the Sponsor-Fund relationship without the prior specific concurrence of the Sponsor. In respect of employees who will

not have knowledge of the Sponsor-Fund relationship, the Fund will, nevertheless, obtain appropriate security clearances from the Sponsor prior to employment.

2. Where appropriate, detailed procedures will be cooperatively developed by the Fund and the Sponsor to insure the effective implementation of the principles outlined in this Memorandum of Understanding.

For that purpose a liaison office in Sponsor's organization will be designated by Sponsor. Except on financial and budget matters which will be handled by the Fund with Sponsor's Office of Administration, and on matters which the Fund desires to take up with the Director of Sponsor or his immediate Deputies, relations between the Fund and Sponsor will be coordinated by or through this liaison office and, except as above, any matters which the Fund desires to bring to the attention of Sponsor may be referred to or through such liaison office.

Mr. Alan Valenting, President
Committee for a Free Asia, Inc.
245 California Street
San Francisco, California

Dear Alan:

It was good to see you, if just for an instant, in Washington.

For your private ear, I might tell you that we won our battle hands down. Merely to confirm this, our Executive Board is having lunch in Washington with Allen and Bedell next Monday. This will be a general talk, but I am sure that policies will come up for discussion. Happily, everything seems to be sailing along in good shape.

I checked down there regarding any taboo concerning your help on the Crusade for Freedom campaign. I think there was a misunderstanding here. They have no thought of providing a complete taboo. Their thought was that all other operation should not stop and your time be devoted wholly to the Crusade.

Actually, we will call upon you for very little help. When Dick Walsh comes out to talk with you within the next ten days, he will give you a complete fill-in on what assistance we would like to have. I am sure you will have no trouble in giving us this assistance.

With regard to the wording of the language by which we transmit the money to you I am going to try to get a Board Meeting together on Tuesday at which time the necessary action will be taken to clear our forwarding letters to you insofar as capital expenditures go.

My very best regards.

Sincerely,

H. B. Miller

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: NCFE-CIA RELATIONS

1. When this Division was delegated the responsibility of conducting CIA relations with NCFE it was immediately apparent that a variety of problems existed which made effective action on the part of IO Division difficult if not impossible. These difficulties may be generally summarized as follows:

(1) Satisfactory mechanical procedures to provide information to CIA and to insure effective cooperation and coordination of activities by CIA and NCFE did not exist. This was true not only in financial matters, such as the orderly submission of budgets and financial reporting, as well as security, but was also true of attempts to give NCFE policy guidance and to insure that NCFE's activities did not compromise CIA operational activities.

(2) The attitude of the responsible officials of NCFE was one largely of non-cooperation in terms of NCFE and CIA efforts being joint to achieve the same objective. Indeed NCFE's attitude was that they are a separate organization with the responsibilities of a corporation in the State of New York and that the role of CIA's representatives in dealing with them was one of being their salesmen rather than partners, that once their general activities were approved and financed, their responsibilities to CIA were fulfilled.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

- 2 -

(3) NCFE has not only failed to provide information about its activities, but had generally expanded its relations with government agencies in an effort to play one agency against another and, indeed, in many cases play the personnel of one agency against other personnel in that agency. A general feeling of suspicion and distrust provaded CIA's relationships with NCFE.

2. In an attempt to properly discharged its responsibilities IO Division has attempted to solve the above problems by (4) preparing an agreement or directive which states sets out the joint responsibilities of CIA and NCFE and which clearly states NCFE's duties and responsibilitis to this Agency. To implement this agreement IO Division has, or is in the process of, creating orderly procedures by which this agreement will be put into effect.

3. If 10 Division is to suceed in its task, which in our opinion is well begun, two conditions are imourcopinion essential:

(1) That there be a single point of liaison between NCFE and CIA and that CIA act as the sole official governmental liaison with NCFE. It should be said that this does not mean that officials of NCFE will not consult with higher authorities in CIA, but that when they do, those responsible in 10 Division will be fully informed.

(2) That NCFE clearly understands with whom they are to deal in CIA and that those with whom they deal on a regular basis are responsible officials entitled to respect as such-

officials whose responsibilities are to lend their
cooperation and guidance insofar as it is necessary to

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: CIA Investigation of Relations

PROBLEM

It is likely that at a meeting you will hold Monday, 4 August, with members of the Board of Directors of the National Committee for a Free Europe, these Directors will maintain they do not wish to sign or to accept a directive and/or agreement as to relations between NCFE and CIA, which has been approved by the CIA administrative staff and the International Organisations Division of CIA.

DISCUSSION

At the time responsibility for CIA dealings with NCFE was transferred to the IO Division, a survey was undertaken by this Division with the help of the CIA administrative staff under Mr. Wolf. The following was found to be the status of relations between CIA and NCFE:

1. Budget and Financial Relations.

a. No orderly submission of budgetary requirements on the part of NCFE has ever been established or practiced. For example, the CIA approved budget for the fiscal year 1952 was substantially different than the budget upon which NCFE based its activities. Bad communication has existed.

b. CIA has not exercised any form of control over NCFE expenditures after initial approval. For example, NCFE has been free to switch funds allocated for one project to some new project or to pay for extending an old one without further reference to CIA.

c. Monies raised by NCFE through the Crusade for Freedom or monies advanced by CIA and unspent at the end of the fiscal year have not been considered in the granting of funds for a new fiscal year.

SECRET

- 2 -

d. When budgets have been presented by NCFF, they have not been presented with reasonable thoroughness or accuracy nor have they indicated expenditures which aro masonably certain and those which are projections of possible activities for which NCFE has nevertheless asked for funds.

e. In cortain instancos, 1.0. grants to certain national councils, NCFE makes expenditures for which there is no adequate accounting to NCFE and on which the Committee has had littlo or no information on how the money is spent.

2. Financial Reporting.

a. It is unquestioned that the internal business and accounting procedurma of NC arn excellent. However, adeqius to financial information has not been presented to A.

b. Security.

As the recont case of Leland Stowo indicaton, NCFE haa disregarded essential security considerations in the hiring of personnel. Noither the Security Offi.cor, WA, nor any other branch or component of CIA, has anything but extramely inado- quate information as to who is on the NCFE payroll.

c. Policy Control.

In its relations with omigros through ito National Councils Division and in its radio broadcasts through RFE, NCFE has in many cases not received adequate guidance from CIA and the State Department and in some instances not followed the guidance provided. CIA is seldom informed by NCFE of its proposed activities other than in its over-all budgetary presentation.

d. Coordination of CIA Activitios with NCHE.

NCFE's activities in radio broadcasting, which account for three-quarters of its yearly budget, are almost entiroly transferred overseas. The action of its 1200 or more overscas personnel often cut across CLA's own field operations. NCFE has not accepted coordination in this field.

3. 10 Division and Administrative Staff Proposed Actions to Solve These Difficulties.

The 10 Division with the assistance of the CIA Administrative Staff has prepared a memorandum of agreement to serve as a guide in

SECGET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 102

GREI

the conduct of relations between CIA and NCFE. This agreement provides the following:

a. Adequate budget information upon which to evaluate the purposes and probable success of proposed NCFE activities as well as an adequate financial reporting system by NCFE so that this Agency can at all times be aware of and insure the approved expenditure of funds by NCFE.

b. Adequate security arrangements so that every employee of NCFE has been given a security clearance necessary for the proper protection of this operation.

c. The IO Division is to be the sole channel of liaison by NCFE to CIA and the State Department. The purpose of this provision is to insure adequate preparation and consistent policy guidance for NCFE in all its varied activities and to afford a single point of liaison and coordination with State Department and the area divisions of CIA. It is by no means intended to prevent officials and directors of NCFE from discussing problems with higher authorities and in fact the IO Division cannot give policy guidance without reference to higher authorities. In the past, however, NCFE has conducted liaison with many of the area divisions in CIA, with the State Department and with various officials in CIA, and there has been a resultant confusion.

d. The agreement provides for the submission of monthly reports by NCFE as to the status of its substantive activities.

4. Attitudes of NCFE.

The basic attitudes of NCFE about themselves is summed up by the comments on the first draft of the above-mentioned agreement by Spencer Phenix:

a. "Our friends can refuse to supply funds for disapproved activities but cannot legally or properly be given the 'right to disapprove or modify any activities or require abandonment, modification, or change in emphasis, in any of the existing programs'."

b. "Again, no agreement between our friends and ourselves can legally diminish our corporate right to spend our corporate funds . . ."

SECRET

- 4 -

c. It is unacceptable that private consent of CIA
should be required as to the appointment of new directors
and officers.

d. The money given to NCFE by CIA is given first to
the 1848 Foundation and this money is then donated to ECFT.
CIA therefore has no right to inquire into policies or
expenditures although "normally we would consult our friends".

5. Basic Attitude of CIA.

CIA has a duty and responsibility to insure affirmatively
the conduct of the NCFE program in accordance with the CI mission
and with the DCI's responsibility to higher authority. A course of
action based upon the view that NCFE's autonomy is such that it
cannot accept the above-mentioned agreement, or some form thereof,
might under conceivable circumstances, i.e. a change in the view-
point of the German Government where most of NCFE's employees are
located, the possibility of high-level changes in NCFE, or the
growing insistence on the part of the exiles for armed liberation,
lead to action not consistent with the DCI's responsibility. At
present a situation exists in which CIA and the Division charged
with CIA responsibility cannot exercise that responsibility.

6. Recommendation.

The PRC has reviewed this agreement and has refused to
approve the budget of NCFE until this agreement or a notification
acceptable to NCFE is adopted. The Director has approved this
decision and it is suggested that he stand upon it.

# AN NCFE APPROACH TO THE EUROPEAN REFUGEE SITUATION

-1-

## INTRODUCTION

Reduced to its simplest terms, the European refugee problem can be resolved, saving liberation, only by the assimilation, or at least the integration of the refugees into the countries which receive them or by their emigration to countries better able to do so. National and international programs vast in scope and cost are required for these purposes, and it is obviously not within NCFE's power or interest to engage directly in them. But, in an indirect way, while paying attention only to its direct and fundamental interests, NCFE can contribute to the success of both types of programs, at least so far as they concern refugees from the ten NCFE countries.

The first step is, of course, for NCFE to analyze its position in relation to the European refugee situation and to formulate a policy accordingly. NCFE has been a constantly and rapidly growing organization, fully occupied with the immediate problems of expansion which have confronted it. NCFE has been deprived of the opportunity to pause and consider the consequences of its expansion in a changed situation, much less to deal with these consequences.

Several basic factors have combined to alter NCFE's position in relation to the European refugee situation. While IRO operated, NCFE was in a position to make a distinction between the exile elite and the mass of refugees, who were under the protection of the IRO in Europe. IRO, however, ceased to exist at the beginning of 1952. IRO's several successor organizations have yet to prove their ability effectively and completely to perform its functions. During the early years of NCFE's existence, the frontier countries, Germany, Austria, and Italy, and the intermediary receiving countries, France and Britain, were absorbed in post-war reconstruction or subjected to military occupation and hence were generally not in a position to take an active interest in the refugees as an instrument of their foreign policies. NCFE in the U.S., therefore, could afford to ignore most developments of exile activity in Europe, reassuring itself that the headquarters of most of the exile National Councils were in the U.S. under nominal U.S. control. Normally, of course, each of these countries has specific interests in Eastern Europe, which do not necessarily coincide with those of the U.S. As conditions approach the normal in each of these countries, NCFE's grounds for self re-assurance become less solid. Until its May 1, 1951 initiation of saturation broadcasting to Czechoslovakia, which marked its appearance as an instrument actively affecting


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

-2-

the countries whence the refugees flee, RFE could also ignore
the presence of the ref gees in the west. This, however, is
no longer the case.

Fundamentally, any NCFE interest in the European refugee
situation is an aspect of the general HCFE relationship with
exiles. In the changed European situation in which this inte-
rest land will be manifested CFE should reconsider its basic
instruments for such relationships: the National Councils.
Thoir exceptions, gaps, and shortcomings should be carefully
unalyzed and the conclusions drwan therefrom. The inadequacy
of the national Councils as a basic instrument in the changed
situstion in Europe will be indicated in this report. Certain
ad ptations of this instrument and the cretion of new ones
will be required if iNCYE is to carry out its functions and
realize its potentilities.

WHY NCFE IS CNC NED I CHE EUROPEAN
REFUGES PROBL
THIS CORRI

## A. The Extent of ilCFE'a Concern to Date:

In the past MCPE hus net directly concerned itself with
the over-all problem of refugees ircm behind the Iron Curtsin.
This policy of CrE has manifested itself in the following ways.
NC75 has consistently made it clear that its enief interest lies
in what it regarded as the political and intellectuel elite of
emigrations from the various Iron Curtain countries. Certain
elements of this political and intellectual olite, however,
realized the necessity and the importance of channeling some
of their activities toward the mass of their respective emigra-
tions on national basis. This realization was dictated either
by humanitarian or strictly re-listic political principles, or
by a combination of the two. Accordingly, these elements of the
elite approached CFE with their proposula for CFE material and
moral support of such: ctivities. These proposals differed widely
and were implemented at varying periods over the last three
L
ers, with the result that presently ACPE is incirectly supporting
refugee activities on a national basis at an annual amount of
2118.168.00, and with the further result that these activities
ure confused, haphazard, erratic, ill-coordinated ani unjustly
and inexplicably disproportionate. Some nationality groups,
as for instance the Hungerians, have been receiving relatively
large amounts for refugee activities, with other groups, as for
example the Foles, who have a large emigration, receiving nothing.

The vehicles for the channeling of this support have also
differed widely. Originally, NC?? 's theory in providing support
for sucit activities was ba ed upon the existence of National


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

-3-

Councils or Committees, the idea being that the National Councils should themselves undertake such activities in order to gain for themselves the necessary standing in their respective emigrations. This was not altogether inconsistent with NCFE's policy of emphasis (upon direct ssistance only to the intellectuan and political elite, but was a subsequent development thereof.

The most ambitious and long-lived of these Hational Councils' refugee projects has been the Refugee Service of the Hungarian National Council, which is the best and almost sole surviving example of NCFE's origin 1 theory. The record, however, even of this prize example, is an extremely spotty one (detalls to follow in a descriptive report to be submitted separately). More importantly, the resons for the spottiness of the dic's record ure not all attributable to the HINC itself; many, indeed, ure due to the situation in which the HCN'spproach to the refugee problem, which hus provided financial support, but little or no guidance or moral support. *Kugler fins has shud had to operate and "Ihlow ated to Aeras

In the Rumanian case, NCFE' support for refugec activities was originally channeled through the kumanian ilational Council, which ceased to enjoy NCFE recognition in 1950. Since that time, NCFE support for Rumanian refugee activities has been given to Rumanian welfare, Incorporated, an organi:tion entirely outside the National Council category, and which includes Americans on ita Board of Directors.

In the Czechoslovak case, CPE his channelod its support for refugee activities through the Council of Free Chechoslovakia, a National Council, which was the victim of a political split lasting from January 1951 until July 4y 1952. The Council of Free Czechoslovakia, in turn, channeled some of this support to en organization which enjoys the status of voluntary agency, the American Pund for Uzechoslovak kefugees. This organization, like Rumanian welfare, Inc., includes Americans on its Board of Directors, which is chaired by Professor James Shotwell. Unlike Rumunian welfare, however, the AFCR in Germany and Austria received from IKO or HICGG and USCOA facilities and/or financial support as did other larger organizations such as the NCWC, the Lutherun World Federation, the World Council of Churches, the American Joint Distribution Committee, etc. which simred with it the status of voluntary agency. There is no doubt that Czechoslovak refugees have been, to some extent, the victims of the political fluctua- tions of their leadership in the 1.3., and that, in sense, NCPE must also accept som responsibility for allowing the political situation to have had repercussions of this nature.

In the case of the Albanians, no specific sums in the budget (which has been provided by CFE) of the National Committee for a Free Albania have been earmarked for aid to Albanian refugees; although despite this the NCFA has, it is reported, que chiefly to close American supervision in kome, m.naged to ac more for Albanian refugees in Italy than other National Councils, as for instance the ill and BNC in Italy.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

-4-

In the case of the Poles, because of the failure of the Polish emigration to produce a united national council which could be recognized by NCFE, no financial support whatever has been given by NCFE to Polish refugee activities, although the roles have one of the most sizable emigrations of all the nationality groups with which NCFE cooperates, and although the Pelos have an organisation, American Polish War Relief, a voluntary agency, which seems to be at least as effective, if not more so than the American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees or Rumanian welfare, Inc., organizations with which it is roughly comparable.

In the case of the Yugoslavs, which is probably the most difficult case of all, from the U.S. and the HCFE point of view as well as from the viewpoint of the individual refugee, HCFE has confined itself to contributing small amounts to the Benevolent Association of Free Citizens of Yugoslavia in London, in order that certain exiled leaders-who rendered signal services to the Allied cause during World War II, through their participation in the revolt of march, 1941, which led Yugoslavia to resist the Nazi Invasion - might receive small stipends. Although this aid is rendered through an organization abroad, to exiles residing abroad, it is in line rather with NCP's policy of providing assistance to a political and intellectual elite than with the policy of indirect support through National Councils or other organisations of refugee activity. No Yugoslav National Council, enjoying HCFE recognition, has ever emerged due to the delicate situation of western policy vis-à-vis Tito's government.

In the case of the three Baltic States, although HCFE has been provided, both in the U.S. and abroad, with the instrumenta which have most nearly proved themselves capable of efficient, just and honest use of funds for refugee activities, no such funds have been placed at the disposal of the three Baltic Consultative Panels or their counterpart committees in Germany and elsewhere abroad.

Originally, also, although the principle was never clearly defined or rigidly adhered to, and, at present, is as much departed from as observed, it was felt that CFE-supported refugee activities should be restricted, as much as possible, to the type of assistance which a consulate would render to its citizens who found themselves in difficulties in a foreign country. Such assistance would according to this line of thinking only occasionally and in cases of extreme and immediate need, be material; essentially it would consist of advice, translation and verification of documents and direction of the refugee to the appropriate agency capable of furnishing him with the type of further assistance, material or otherwise, which might be required. It has always been recognized, however, that the various National Councils acting as consulates for their anti-Communist compatriots, who could not turn to the legally-recognized Communist embassies, legations or consulates of their countries for help, would have to provide some material assistance for those who turned to them for help, if only a tram ticket, to allow them to visit the various international and local social agencies who could help them, or


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

-5-

the price of a meal or a night's lodging which would carry them over the necessary period of time which it always takes until the machinery of other agencies can be persuaded to start grinding for the assistance of these people. However, as time went on, NCFE assistance was also being given, directly or indirectly, to agencies which gave particular attention to material aid, as for instance the APCR and Rumanian Welfare, neither of which has any clear and responsible relation with a National Council, yet each of which has been the victim, to some extent, of the vagaries of exile politics.

Some of the elements which seem, either consciously or unconsciously to have been operative in the development of this NCFE policy of only limited and indirect concern with the over-all problem of refugees from Eastern Europe were the following:

1.  Refugees in the mass were already the direct concern of a large, well-staffed and well-financed international organization, the IRO, which meant that the problems confronting the National Councils and other organizations of the exile elite were limited in scope.

2.  Until the initiation of saturation broadcasting to Czechoslovakia on May 1, 1951, NCFE (through RFE or any other instrument) was not itself an active factor in the refugee problem. It was not directly associated with the refugee himself, either through indirectly stimulating him to flee or through his increased value for information purposes.

3.  The National Councils and Committees were considered to be a suitable instrument qualified to deal with the refugee problem in the limited manner in which it confronted them during the existence of IRO. It was felt that any credit for assistance to refugees could appropriately be given to the national councils, which would in turn reflect to the credit of NCFE, the U.S. and the Free West in general.

-III-

THE CHANGED SITUATION
U.S. AND EUROPE

While IRO operated NCFE was in a position to make a distinction between the exile elite and the mass of refugees who were under the protection of the IRO in Europe. INC, however, ceased to exist at the beginning of 1952. Even before IRO disappeared, care and maintenance of refugees in and out of camps had passed to the various local national authorities. IRO's functions of protection and care for the refugee in both legal and material aspects respectively from arrival to emigration have been divided


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

Among these governments and two international agencies, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and PICMS, none of which has been provided with the means adequate to the performance of their tasks assigned it, and the latter of which are only just becoming fully operational. In consequence of IRO's closure the various voluntary agencies, such as CNC, LWF and KCC, etc., have been deprived of facilities which were provided by IRO in the past, with the result that they have been compelled to curtail their activities. Neither of IRO's successors has assumed the vast and vital coordinating function performed by IRO, with the result that the present confusion is discouraging. It may develop that the New State Department - MSA program for neo-refugees will clarify this confused situation, but at present it, itself, is as yet unknown factor and naturally rumors regarding it at the field level have thus far only served to confound the confusion.

The period of INC's existence coincided with the period of mass emigration, whereas at present emigration possibilities are small and uncertain, with the result that to the hard core remnant, which cannot be moved, is being added to the small but steady flow of new arrivals, most of whom are unable to emigrate and who must also face the appalling employment conditions in the frontier countries of Germany, Austria, Italy and Triest (in the other frontier countries of Greece and Turkey the situation is probably similar) and the intermediary receiving countries such as France and Britain. Out of the more slowly moving remnants, particularly in the frontier countries, the possibility exists for the formation of more stable national committees, which would hence be more susceptible of control.

During the early years of NCFE's existence the frontier and intermediary receiving countries were either absorbed in post-war reconstruction or were subject to military occupation and hence were not in a position to take an active interest in the refugees as an instrument of their foreign policies. NCPE, in the U.S., therefore, could afford to ignore most developments of exile activity in Europe, reassuring itself that the headquarters of the exile national councils were in the U.S. under nominal NCFE control. Normally, of course, each of these countries has specific interests in Eastern Europe, which do not necessarily coincide with those of the U.S. There are now strong indications that the situation is more rapidly approaching its more normal aspect and that it is still in the process of change in this direction.

In January the British-backed Central and Eastern European Commission of the European movement held its first meeting in London; in April the French Comité Nationale pour l'Europe Libre emerged; and in June the Germans attempted to bring about the emergence of a central organization of refugees, which, in its composition reflected traditional German sympathies with the Separatist movements of Eastern Europe, a policy which is in direct conflict with that of NCFE and RFE.. Although the authorities, particularly in the frontier countries, probably lack

political situntion to their advantage. It seems resonable to
suppose that as these nationa gain in strength and indeperdance.
this process will continue at an increasing rate.

As a result of the factors described above, the refugee
finds himself in an increasingly hostilo environment, coprived
of an olfactive international protector and incapable, alone,
unsided and unulded clonaly to aos his interests and defend
them from exploitation. The Crochoslovaks and Foles in Germany
provede atrising examples of shortsighted, aimless exile
pre-occupation with utorile political manouvering to the advan-
tugo of their German houts. At the same time, the voluntary
agencies in Germany, which, fter Iho's domine, were ntud
cortain facilities by RICOC must, after thoratification of the
contractual agroemonts, look to the Gorman Government for
whatever facilities it may choose to grant them.

Until its May 1951 initiation of aturation broadcasting
to Czechoslovakia, which arked its appearence as a: nst nstrument
actively affecting the countries whence the refugees lee, REE
could also ignore the presence of the refugees in the west.
Since that time, however, the steady expansion of RFE's activity
and its increasing need of refugeon as informational sources have
led to stron, accusations that ASS 10 evading its responsibi-
lities und failing to accept the consequences of its own effec-
tiveness. Although RFE expressly refrains from specifically
inciting its audiences to flee, its comparisons of life in the
heat with life in the Easty inevitably constitute an indirect
encouragement to cocope. Those accusatione and resentment are
ill-concealed amon, the representatives of the various interna-
tional and voluntary agencies.

RFE's information service men, who, of RFE's personnel, are
in closest contact with the refu.oes, sympathize with this
criticism and wish that they could do more for the refugees than
they are prosently able to do on their own. These RFE information
gatherers are in competition with an endless series of rivals
Heeking this valuable commouity. ity. They usually present the refugeез
who have been holpful in providing them with information with
presents of food, cigarettes or money. Although they would like
to be in a position to move more than this for their into mants,
they cannot, for, as they explain, they are not in the welfare
busines8. One of their special difficulties is to persuade the
refugees to come to them in the first place. Almost universally
they have reported that if the refugees were made to r alize that
Free Europe was doing something or them, they would be more willing
and even eager, to come to the Rrs information offices in the camps
to give freely of their information. Furthermore, RES's propa-
ganda can be dangerously wenkoned by the boomerang effect of the
few disillusioned refugees who return to their homel.nda.

In respect to the second vacuum, the Brisiah, the. French, the Italiano, the Austrians and the Gormans have tie possibilities of filling this vacuum. Of these, the Veran interest is most likely to provide the most direct and immediate conflict with NCFE-RFE interonta. The fact that the Ger. ans have deconstruted an interest in these committeos and particularly in support of the Soparatiat clements indicates that liове comm1-ttees are not without political importance: Becaues of the political ambitions or a nebst desire to serve of tasir lenders and of the nend of the refugee for apokesmen and representativos in their doulinge with local authorities, auch committees will always exist, whether or not they ro controlled or supported. If these committees re to be controlled at uil, 1: 13 obviously to NCFR's advantage that they be controlled by NCFE. It would b০ dungorous to assume that this control could be exercised solely through the "loudera" residing in the J.3. as the opportunity exists for theun leaders and for those in Europe to play off one Bestern Power against another. It has already been demons-trated in ono caso that the branch of a national council, with headquarters in the U.3., que to the exigencies of the local situation may be obliged to follow a policy which is quite contrary to the interests of NCFE.

In addition to the major double vacuum described above, our survey has disclosed the existence of a number of cinor vicaums in exile representation which have been filled by unecrupulous self-appointed national representativos whose presence has been largely responsible for the skepticism and mistrust with which exile representatives are frequently regarded by the international and voluntary agencies. This unfortunate factor may be traced to the lack of recognized accreditation for such representatives, to the absence of any responsiole and c nsistent field supervision, control and backing of worthy and quali lified representatives. In this regard, representativos os of the N ilich Commission and th voluntary agencies have xpressed u definite interest in offorté to order the chaotic national representativos.

RECONS SIDERATI TIGH OF NOFE'S BASIC
IN VIRU ON RELATION
WITH

As we have shown above, it is to NOFE's interest to attempt to order this confused situation, and if the attempt is to be made, careful consideration must be given to the selection of the tools wiich are to be used. The Division of NOFE which has hitherto dealt with NCFE's relations with the exiles, und indirectly with the refugees, he been the National Councils Divisions. This Division

hus used as its basic instrument the National Councils and Committees which have their headquarters in the U.S. NCFE'S experience over the past three years has served conclusively to modify the initial view of the National Councils as suitable instruments for the creation not only of an atmosphere of positive and constructive cooperation, but even for the effective Implementation of NCF policy and purpose.

The divisive factors of exile have resulted in:

1.  The absence of any Polish National Council which can qualify for NCFE recognition;

2.  The absence of any Romanian National Council which can qualify for NCFE recognition;

3.  A prolonged split ( a year and a half) in the Council of Free Czechoslovakia;

4.  A precariously balanced Hungarian National Council.

Other factors have produced a Bulgarian National Committee which is unsatisfactory from almost every point of view. Genuine and productive reform of the BNC will doubtless prove a prolonged and difficult process. This leaves the NCF with a National Committee for a Free Albania, which could stand reform and which, nevertheless, has always been closely supervised by Americans and with the three Baltic Consultative Panels which were established entirely by NCFE in the first instance.

No single national council during its existence, with the possible exception of the three Baltic Consultative Panels, has demonstrated itself as being capable of even reasonably efficient and just administration of its own affairs. In each case NCFE has been obliged to stop in, at first exercising only cursory supervision, but at present attempting to introduce systems of closer administrative and financial control and supervision, which, unless made sufficiently rigid, will doubtless prove as unsatisfactory as they have been in the past.

Where national councils do exist branches or sections of these councils which have demonstrated their effectiveness can and should be used where practical to implement on secondary level NCFE projects and policies. For the primary implementation of these projects and policies, however, a more permanent, ordered and controllable apparatus must be found, one not liable to the naturally disruptive tensions of exile life. Even where unity in a national council can be produced, experience has proved that its continuity is at best tenuous and unreliable, with the result that the council becomes a delicate and cumbrous apparatus which must subordinate the achievement of practical goals to the maintenance of this temporary and elusive unity.

Further factors disclosed by our survey reinforce the conclusion that if NCFE is, as we believe it must, effectively to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

-10-

develop its interest in the European refuger field, a new instru-
inent must be found. Those factors iso tond to indicate roughly
some of the qualities which this instrument cust po93089.

1.  No single exile organisation engaged in refugee acti-
    vity, including those receivin; NCTS support, is consistently
    good in 11l of its local branches. This observation applies
    also to those organizations receiving NCP support watch do
    not fell into the national council category (the AFGR and
    Rumanian Felfaro).

Conclusions:

In its activity in the European refuges 21:14, SOFE
muat bo completely free to select the organizations and indi-
viduals with which it may consider it practic to cooperate
on any level. NCPE must therefore not be comm12164 to support
or to cooperate wit!. any organization in all parts and
must be free to sever connections tony time with any orguni-
zation or its parts (individuals or sections) with which it
finds it no longer practical to cooperate. NC77 cast be comple-
tely flexible in this operation.

2.  The rofugee in Europe is confronted with a situation
    which is fluid in all its spects. Ho faces clace the closure
    of IRO, a multitude of uncoordinated agencios, the continued
    existence of some (the voluntary agencies) 18 scertain; the
    operations of fothers (the Dil und "ICLE) romain be developed
    fully; the scope and activity of another (the State Department
    Program) is in the rumor stage. He is uncortaic, suspicious
    and rateful of the now status and intentions of 20 loc 1 natio-
    nal authorities under whose immediate jurisdiction he must live.
    ine fuces the after-effects of mass omigration, saica, although
    it ceased some time ago, a deprived him of the most qualified
    of his compatriots and honce of stable national Leadership.
    For himself, the limited, uncertain and uncocmicated cmigration
    on an individual beais which still exists offere but faint hope
    for departure from the frontier countries. le Laces almost
    impossible employment conditions, depending upon local situa-
    tions and seasonal work which often requires die being shifted
    from place to placo the employment situation dictates. The
    majority, however, must stay in the camps or on the colo. He
    faces shifting campe which are often moved or cizzolved by the
    loc.1 authorities. These actors combin to procace a demora-
    lizing feeling of impermanence and insecurity. They aro, in
    turn, aggravated by the unsympathetic attitude of the countries
    in which the refugee finds himself, an attitude which frequently
    approaches hostility and which is not improved by the presence
    in these countries of emb tered expelled ethnic zinorities who
    were nce the citizens of the refugee's homeland. The homelindo
    is a deplorable feeling of apatay, hopelessness, isolation and
    abandonment ani a total lack of any sense of direction or purpose.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 115

-11-

Conclusions :

NOF's appro ch to the refugee and his problems must be broad in order that it may icpart a feeling of purpose, airec- tion, continuity and security. This appro ch must have an attractive national flavor which will appel to the refugee"s desire to belong, without encouraging his chauvinistic tendencies, and, indeed, should provide a positive substitute for them. To implecent this approach NCPR's instrument in the field must gain be supremely flexible but susceptible of close and regid control. This instrument must be capable of conveyin;; an impression of seriousness, responsibility and constructive interest, thus inspiring Teeling of confidence on the purt of the authorities and agencies as well as the refugees.

3. In general it may be observed that in the frontiers countries there is a not ble lack of knowledge of CEE's role in support of the admittedly limited and relatively negligible refugee activities in which it is thus far indirectly engaged. RFE is, of course, widely known and inest as widely criticized for its failure to accept responsibility for its part in the refugee problem. FINE 18 usually known, out only vaguely and secondarily, and in many cases the picture of its scope, acti- vities nd gouls is distorted. There is a din awareness of FEJE's conection with RFF, but a general Lilure to draw any conclusions therefrom.

Conclusion:

To engage in refugee activities of any nature or extent without clearly identifying and labelling HCFE an the organiza- tion ultimately responsible for these scrivities is a neodless and senseless failure to exploit a possibility in the form of enhanced 1083 prestige and greater sympathy and cooperation with the work of RFE and FEUS on the part of both refugees and other active agencies. Particularly from the point of view of REE's essential relationship to the refugees it is a serious mistake not to do so. Thorolore the instrument which NOPE adpp for its work in this field must be identifiable only as an CFE operation, clearly related to RFE and FEUE.

4. It has dea: mentioned previously that the international anu voluntary agencies tena to regard the exile representatives with skepticism and tend to hold thes at ara's length. This attitude seems partilly to result from their ignorance of exile politics and their understandable reluctance to become involved therein. Their ignorance and disinterest as in several caseB led them to choose refugee assistants and aavisors of unfortunate political background and tendencies from the CFE point of view. Again, however, as mentioned above, the representatives of several of these agencies have expressed a definite interest in having these insuppressible refusee groups somehow organised and controlled.

Conclusion :

Responsible and direct American control would therefore


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 116

-12-

do such to dispel this negative attitude and would pave the way
for a wore positive and productive cooperation between the natio-
nai refugee groups and the agencies clive in their behalf.
Tafe cointroi would also it is reable to suppose, help to
fill vacuums in exile representation of the kind described .bove.

5.  Anoteer weaknose of the organizations surveyed in the
    frontier countries is their alzost iveral tendency in greater
    or Leaser degrees to discriminate patically or persen lly in
    the Distribution of assistance. There is no comparison between
    to extent of this woniness in the tense ani unmottled atmosphere
    of the frontier countries ad tas more corsal environment of
    BA intermediary receiving countries, France and Britain. In
    aisition to the injustice of such crimination, definito oppor-
    tunities are lost through failure seriovely to attempt to win
    0795, through. lens narrow assistance, elements (such as the Czech
    and Slovak Separatisto, Hungarian aztrelicta and the Seawabs)
    4.1cm now oppose or inthe future siger oppone the political and
    national structures which RCF recognizes and supports..

Conclusion:

Ag-in, close RCFE guidance and control aro indicated so
thet injustices way be reduced and swolder NCFE aims implemented,
rather than tserted by narrower Interests of short-sighted and
ussalightened refugos representatives.

A. NCFE's approach

If NCFE is to codify its prezect instruments and create new
ones 10 anifest its interest in the prob. & of refugees in
Europe, it sacula first formulate a broad and comprehensive
approach to the refugee as tipec person in whom and in whose
problems this interest is to be 820.

This approach will, by the nature of CEO's interest in the
refugee, aifier zarkedly from those other organisations active
in the field.

All these organizations, the intelligence agencies, the
local national governments, the 21g Commissioner and the
voluntary agencies, are interested the Czechoslovak or
Ruzanian or Pole who crosses the beer because, respectively,
he right be a Corcunist agent or have information, he is or might
be a political refugee or because se saa human being in need.
NCE is interested in him because he iz Czechoslovak or Rumanian


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

-13-

or Pole --a citizen of country whose people were promised at Yalta certain rights and privileges which they have not received because of the violent interference of a Communist Russia. This is also the fund mental theoretical reason for RFE broadcasts to the Czechoslovaks in Czechoslovakia, the Foles in Poland, te. The fundamental practical reuson 1 of course the interest of the United States in these nations and peoples us European politic1 factors.

RFS obviously cannot create a military machine capable of liberating the nations of Eastern Europe. It is interested qhite simply in promoting the existence of certain ttitudes, interests und activities which will ono day contribute to the successful fulfillment of the promises made at Yalta. RYS is intereated List mothers should teach their children certain truthe to counter Communist liest that workers should react in certain ways to Communist pressures, tint students should understand the fallacios of the system which they are being seduces or forced to serve. In short, RFE wiohos to direct Czeci.colovaks. in Czechoslovakia, Poles in Poland and Hungarians in ilungary to act in the enlightened self-interest of their respective nations. The fact that this enlightened self-interest, 10 supported by RFE, coincides with our own and other broder intérests serves only to underline its importance.

se have tried to point out in this report the ex.ent to which the presence and activities and problems of the refuдоев from NOFA countries in "ostern Europe cannot but be of interest to NCFE. Again, NCFE need not concern itself directly with the feeding, housing, employment and emigration of these people, any more than RFE should itself undertako to raise an hai
2my.

This is not to say late icrs may not.. ind it advisablo0 0 continue to use limited welfare funds in its work with fugees. But its principal tasks will be to protect its interests by attempting to produce some order out of the cimos of refugees activities by giving to the refugee and his representativen a sense of direction and belonging which the other agencies active in the field are admittedly unable adequately to provide. Without it, the refugee in Europe laost inevitably sinks into a state of hopeless and isolated apathy. He belongs to nothin but the tense na quarrelsome fr.torty of his fellow abandoned. Sitting unoccupied all day, his only activity soon becomes the endless intrigue of the political parties. with few books and less commu- nication with the outside world, and particularly, without constructive leadership and uince, the parties become almost the only organizations with a notional flavor open to the refugee. In this tmosphere it is not surprising that refugee nationalisme become chauvinistic and ideas, of nation interest, subordinated to the narrow and petty goals of the political parties.

The voluntary and other agencies and the locl national authorities can hardly provide a constructive substitute since they only approach the refugee as such, reenforcing his apathy by their euch needed gifts, unable to cfier allegiance to anything other than the Churches, opposed or reluctant to undertake any


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

-14-

altempt at support or guidance of his national tendencies. In
#11 firness, it should be noted, however, that the current
approach to the rofugee on the part of all these agencies is a
coracious and considerable leprovement on the exaggerated and
Incentive-Killing IRO dolo system.

But if NCFR approaches the new auc pae, as well as the
older Dr, not no a neody "refugee" but as a citizen of his
country who simply finds himself in a difficult position on
this side of the Iron Curtain rathr than on the other sise,
it zuould be possible to appeal to his desire for national
continuity and than to some oxtont appol to his ideas of his
own enlightened self-interest in much the same way that such
appeais are provided for the escapee's compatriots at hoze
by 7.

This approach woule also take into account the significant
fact that many of the new arrivale, (cstimates run as hien as
are not real "political refugees". They leave their
countries for economic reasona or because they are fed up or
simply want to try out the conditions in the best which are
described to them as no much superior to those in their hoze
lanie. Among these people there are of course any mistite,
incompetent a and undesir bles. No one should delude himself
with a picture of all refugees as worthy, deservios, honest
people persecuted by a Communist regime and fleeing for their
very lives.

SCHE interests, however, override this unfortunate reality:
no individual who leaves a satellite country for any reason
whatever should be allowed to fall into such a condition of
disillusionment that he should consider returning or even consider
serting word of his discouragement home. One such return or
report of personal disillusionment can produce a most unfortunate
countereffect to RFE and other Bestern propagands. It is an
accepted fact that there have been such cases and they are in
fact regarded as one of the factors contributing to the present
loser arrival rate of now oscаресв.

Granted thi pproach to the escapee and the old refugee
and Drae a citizen, and the desire to promote among these people
the lies of concern for their real self-interests, the ide which
most acequately describes this approach is that of the "corculate".

The functions of a consultere to protect the interests
of the citizen abroad. Katerial assistance is provided only in
савев 21 emergency the consulates principal task is to take
an active interest in guiding the citizen to those local agencies
beat abic to satisfy his wents and to suggest approaches and
attitudes most likely to benefit him during his stay abroad.
The Lost glaring and urgent example of the need for such consular
guidance may be found in the necessity for protecting the Czecho-
slovaka in Germany not only from the political opposion of the
Germans, but from their own senseless, destructive ana short-
sighted political maneuverings.

## 3. Jodifications of 's present instrument.

As indicated above, it will of courah be useful und desirable to incorporate in this approach and in the new instrument, (FECB), designed to implement it, features, (individuals and organisations) of the present instrument which hav demonstrated their effectiveness. However, also an mentioned earlier, in order to sure the freedom of action and freedom of choice of the new instrument, certain modifications of those, fonturos of the present instrument will be required.

1. It will first of all be nocennary that those features (individuals and organizations) of the prosent instrument consi-dored suit ble for incorporation in FECS be separated adminia-tratively and financially from their headquarters, since PECS will operate on the basis of the following prodedural approacht

Such individuals or organizations will be incorporated in FECS on one primary s their proved effectiveness in the past and/or their promise of offectiveness uncor CFE guidance; their retention will be dependent upon their ability successfully to continue this performance. This is of course basically an adaptation of part of the approach which has enabled RE and AFS to make effective use of qualified exile personnel for the attain-ment of their own goals.

2. For the undirected and uncoordinated system of almost complete lack of control which has hitherto generally prevailed in NCFE's relationship to refuges activities and exile organi-sations, will be substituted a system of control which will preserve at lost the illusion of freedom through the incorγρο-ration of qualified exile orga: Izations and individuals ond the selection of otiors to fill gaps which such organizations and individuals Lave proved unable to fill. The fact of thefr ultimate responsibility to ACFE should be made bundantly clear. That this is in no way incompatible with the atmosphere of an illusion of freedom in which FECS's exile employees will be working is amply proves by the success of RFS national desks. It will be made clear to these employees that they should consider themselves to be working as consuls and consuler assistants under a civil service progr. They should be given the impression that the responsibility for the success of FECS in its attempts to assist the refugeed lies in their hands, and that its failure for reasons of favoritise or dishonesty would constitute un evasion of their patriotic responsibility.

## C. Functions and potentialities of FECS.

The underlying purpose of FECS is of course to serve the policies and basic interests of NCFE.. Se have tried to indicato the extent to which its work with the refugees would be directly to these interests. Other interests which PECS would have the purpose of serving might be i

1) The prevention or misunderstandings on the part of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 120

-16-

refugees and other agencies active in the field regarding all phases of ACPE work, and particularly that of FCUS and RFE.

2) The attempt to keep the NCFE Suropean Representative and the RFE Political Advisor informed of oxile political developments 1: Europe which micht ffect their operations and to control and guide theio dvelop: nts wherever possible to the udvantage of NCPE and RFE. For example, ACFE, designed to wage political varfere on brond front, was recently almost outflanked in Germany. Some organized means of preventing Buch occurences, or at least of reporting their development, should be provided.

1. The primary function of PECS is to approach the refug00 os a citizon and by so doing to try and set up conditions and introduce a spirit which will make it possible for the refugoo to encape from the pathy which is his traditional lot and become a positive factor in the struggle of the nest. FCS will attempt to perform this function in several ways:

a. Normal consular activity. FECS will engage in the normal concular activities of interventions on behalf of refugees with the local authorition, voluntary agencies, international agencies such as the UN High Commission, or wherever else it might effectively and usefully do so. It will provide translations, verify documents, advise refuzoes on 11 relevant matters in conjunction with those other agencies and generally interest ithelf in all aspects of the refugee's life and problems.

b. Material assistance. white material asnistance should be kept to a minimum, it must be recognized that FRCS will be required to provide more help of this kind than the normal consu- ltes, since the physical condition of the person .ppealing for assistance will almost invariably be poor. Other or nications are botter wet up to provide such anteriol needs, and CS should of course attempt to cooperate with their already extensivo efforts to prevent duplicotion. Jut FCS muat have available emergency welfare funds in order to escape the accusation that it is a feath rbed or nother operation to "use" the retugoe.

c. Refugee corale. The fundamental practical target of all FECS operations should be the improvement of refugee morale. This morale depends on two factors: the refugee's frame of kind and the atmosphore in which he lives.

The refugee's frame of mind should be improved in several ways. The first of these is the citizenship approach which is to govern all 2803 oporations. It should be manifested as soon ae possible after the refugee's arrival and clearance, i omly in the fora of a greeting and briefing from someone not interested in milking the relugee of inforation and aning his questions. This briefing alght include a description of the voluntry agencies which might assist the refugee, a description in simple terms of his logul status and, of course, of the FECS progres, including the nincs and addresses of its representatives in the caps or


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

-17-

areus to which the refugen might be cont. The refuzon might
aloc be saved consicer ble disillusionmont il at this time ho
were given a carefully worded description of the difficult
economic situation in which ho will be obliged for some time
to reasin. For example in Germany, the rolugee should be told
of the presence of large numbers of refugees from the East Zone
and of a German government's natural desire to pulst them.
A representative of one of the voluntary agencios Buggested
to us at tas refugees are rarely made to understand that they
are liially accepted into countrios fuced with unusually severe
economic problems.

Secondly, the refugee's frame of aina might be improved
by the installation of reading rooms containing publications
In the national languages, some of then gesreć ospegelly to
the refuges and his problems. For example, some of the usoful
exilo-organ Led refugee ald Committees such as the Anglo-Rumanian
in London and the Hungrian Office in bunicii procuce rol.r
'bullotins containing local logul and employmont news of interest
to the rougee. Such bulletins should receivo a wider diotri-
bution uni others like them should be crouted. In this connection,
it should be noted that RP3. publications are not reaching the
refu.jeon, among whom our survey has indicated they would be
mont welcome and re qucis needed. Also in the rending roomu,
radios should be provided in response to the conire, frequently
expressed to us, of hearing HPE and other brožúcasts in the
nation11nguages.

The organization of constructivo meetings, discussions and
national colebretionn would provide an outlet for refugee enthu-
siaums if they were supervised by competent lendorclip. 51m1-
larly, PMCO Gaould stimulate and possibly provide the means
for self-help work projects, such as the paintingh of barracks,
the planting of gardene nu the organization of sowing cirelos,
language courses or discussion groups, etc....

The socons factor involved in the question of retugon
morale is that of his environment, the atmosphere in which ho
lives. To a large extent this wtmoepnare would be improved-in
wichik lives. To a large extont lais atmosphere would be
laproved by the orgurization, noted above, of constructive
Cutlets for the energies now dissipated in chauvinistic and petty
politic i intercal and international strife, both of which inve
at times led to murder in the camps.

FC3 major effert in this direction, however, should be
directed toward bridging the gup in a constructive maner botween,
on the one hand, the voluntary and international agencies and
the local authorities, and, on the other, the essential national
intereste of the refugee. Occasionally representatives of the
voluntary agencies have mentioned the fact that refugees sometimes
cooporite with them best when the situation has been explained
by one of their national representatives. For the reasons of
suspicion on the part of thene agencies cited earlier, this is
not always done. FECS could provide a responsible instrument for
so doing.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 122

-18-

The principal gap which exists at present between the various authorities and the refugees is over the question of assimilation, or, as it is usually described, "integration" and "adaptation". There is a natural feeling on the part of these agencies and authorities that in view of the real iction of emigration possibilities, the only alternative open to many of the refugees is to adapt themselves to their environment. The refugee, is, however, quite understandably reluctant to do so: He plans to return to his country when it is liberated "next year"; he is sure he will emigrate shortly; particularly in Germany, he may strongly dislike or distrust the local population. There is also of course the determining factor of employment possibilities -- one of the aspects of the refugee problem with which FECS cannot and need not directly concern itself.

Indirectly, however, FECS can contribute to its resolution. For example, in Germany, the problem of national schools, which has been a sore point, suggests a suitable compromise. The refugees have struggled to maintain full-time national schools for their children, sometimes succeeding with IGFE and other external support, while the local and International authorities have insisted that refugee children attend German schools. The refugee must be made to understand that it is to his children's interest to allow them to adapt as long as the essential elements of national culture can be preserved. This requirement could be and in some instance is already being met by extra-curricular instruction in the national language, history and culture.

In the same way the refugee must also be shown that by refusing to adapt, he may make of his national group an ingrown, despised and distrusted minority. If on the other hand, he shows willingness to adapt to the situation in which he finds himself, he is much more likely to obtain not only physical but psycho-logic 1 benefits in the form of broader practical experience, with the possibility that this experience may one day be of use to him in his own homeland. This is a difficult point which the mass of refugees will be reluctant to grasp. Some of their more intelligent leaders, however, -- the kind which FECS hopes to employ -- might be able to explain its importance. Also, the experience of one camp director in Trieste has proved that it is not impossible to get results through healthy national competitions; if the Rumanians paint their barracks, the Hungarians feel more obliged to paint theirs. While prob bly ineffective among the hardened older refugees, shame might successfully be used among new arrivals, as for example, "If you say you intend to return after liberation, what will you tell your friends that you did for Poland in emigration? That you helped create friends for Poland by keeping the neatest barracks in Germany -- or that you sat around a pigsty all day doing nothing? That you refused to take a job in construction company because it was beneath you, or that you helped to build a stronger and more prosperous wout to hasten the day of liberation?" arguments of this kind were not wholly without effect on strikers, and shirkers, during the war. Doubtless they have been tried by representatives of the voluntary agencies, etc., but FECS representatives should


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 123

-19-

have additional authority for such arguments by virtue of their
membership in one division of an organization actively working
in many ways for the liberation of the refugecs' homelands.

Also, just be the presence of extracu ricular schools,
by their garuntee of the preservation of the essentials of
national culture, encourage attendance at German schools, so
the manifestations of NCFE's similar interest on the local
level through FECS might liberate the refugee from the anxiety
for maintaining his traditions within his smaller group and Bo
diminish his reluctance to attempt some measure of adaptation.
In this connection the citizenship approach applies particularly,
since FEC3 must demonstrate that MCPE is not only generally and
broadly interested in keeping satellite cuiture alive(th the
DIO and foa at FEUE), but also in keeping the individual refugee
living outside a camp, in touch with his compatriots and trudi-
tions not only through personal contact but by making available
to his publications in his languago, etc; In 10 way the
refugee mig t be encouraged in his slow process of adaptation
to strange and in many cases avalle environment.

This is again a vast problem affected by many factors
far beyond the scope of FECH or #CFE. It is almost certaily
true that if more respectable and worthwhile jobs were availa-
ble to refugees, much of their apparently nationally based
aversion to adaptation would disappear,

But if FECS makes emphasis on adaptation one of its
major points of polcy, and makes this fact clear to the local
national and international authorition, and then actively imple-
mente this policy,ne suggested above, it will almost certainly
find itself most sympathetically regarded by these authorities.

2. These are but a few of the functions which FECS should
   be able to perform; anyone regularly active in the field could
   probably suggest many more. There are, however, certain broader
   potentialities for the development of this instrument which
   might be briefly suggested ere.

In the first place, it should be possible to gain
some advantage, beyond the fact that they come to us, from
the presence of the refugees in the west. FECS might be able
to produce such an advantage.

To brand this approach as hopelessly idealistic is to
ignore the extraordinary practical results achieved at Camp
Valka from July 1951 to January 1952 oy the German cap commander
at that time, von Howeyer. When von Homeyer, with no previous
experience of these problems arrived, Valke was in terrible
situation. Anifinga and riots were frequent and the Nuremberg
police were not only on constant alert, out a force of 28 men
was maintained at the camp.

Von Homeyer began by calling the national representatives
together, and it took him two weeks to get them into one room


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

-20-

Finally, when they had assembled, he gave them hell and explained it would be a waste of time for them to try to alter or influence the situation in their own countries from Valka. He told them he believed the c.use of many difficulties was the personal interest of any of the leaders in preparing the way for big roles at home after liberation. He then presented his idea of forming the first European community at Valka. He told the national representatives he had no support from Munich - he was on his own and asked for their help and cooperation. Che by one they came to him and agreed.

Von Homeyer's technique of making friends with the people, with whom he soon acquired an excellent reputation, was effective instrument in swinging their national committes to his side, for aware of his popularity, they hesitated not to show active cooperation. As a means of delegating self- administration of the camp to elected representatives, von Homeyer was about to establish a small parliment when he was recalled by rensens of a German administrative snafu in which favoritism playd a part. Just before his departure, the Huremberg chief of police appro ched him and asked that he request the withdrawal of the permanent squad, which the chief felt was no longer required due to the enormous progress in camp behaviour.

After von Homeyer's replacement by an unizuginative bureaucrat, the situation at Valka relapsed into violence. Yet his influence lingered, and delegations from the national groups visited him, be sing him to return to the camp. Later, when the situation became aven worse, delegates from the German administrative personnel at Valka alas come to urge that he return. This was just before our talk with hie, and the employees brought with them tales of the latest kniling. Obviously von Homeyer's idealistic and far-sigiated approach to the refugee problem and made profound impression ne only upon the refug es themselves but on Germans associated with the problem in pr.ctical way.

Von Home Br's European community approach might be borne in mind in connection with NCPE's espousal of the policy of Federalism. Similarly the FRCS citizenship approach sight have the potenti..lity of being broadened to provide grass-rocts emphasis on this aspect of ICPE's policy. The iden of Europe.n citizenship for refugees is not original or new, but it might provide NCFE and RFE with useful propugend weapon."

Von Homeyer's realistic and productive idealism perhaps also indicates the necessity for at least trying to uncover and support more positive elements than the usual exile poli- tical lemmers, even though it is believed likely that the 1:tter will be able to regain control of their political machinery and return to power after libration. For this re::80., not to attempt the production of more constructive leaders and attitude: core amenable to NCFE and US interests is an example of infatuation with "ard-boiled "realism for its own sake.

nother potential use of PECS might be in conjunction with certain proposals advanced by individual RFE staff Berers. These call for the use of rofugees as e uncing bourde for group romotions to new brondemet themes and as sample groups for testing basic stoellite country attitudes. Refugees helped by
THCS might be more interested in contributing to such projects;
conversely, FCCB offorts to restore their feeling of belonging to the struggle for liberation of their countries would be imme.curable assisted by this opportunity for them to assist in the sharpening of this potent "sister weapon".

HCFE and RFA exile employeen who by and large torn a privileged class among the refugees as a result of being rels-
tively wall paid, should be encouraged to contributo small but regular nosats of their salaries on a voluntary deduction basis to refugee welfare. Some RFT employees have lrendy done this on an informal basis and have expressed a desire to do so on a regular doduction basis but have been siscouraged by the information that this would involve violation of RFE regula- ions. In view of the success of a similar welfare fund insti- tuted by the rollsh Labor Service Companies attached to the 3.3. Army in Germany, it is recommended that this possibility be investigatod. NECS might provo a sure means of channeling such aid to the refugee.

The form for refugoos in Turkey establised by the Gaz1 Khan Bessolt Committee which has an internationalspect resembling Yon Homoyer's approach would qualify for inclusion in the FEC3 program, although no specific proposal can be made until after a detailed field survey.

D. Proposed organisations of FECS.

1. PECS will be a service section of ICFS under the direc- torship of HUYE's General European Representativo. General policy headquarters will therefore be in Paris as well as the operationel subsection responsible for the administration of weg! the FACS branches in England and Fruace. This will have the advantages of removing the general policy headquarters from The immediate tensions and pressures of the frontier countries. The Director will have the task of general policy coordination of PECS with other NCPE divisions and of gining on a high level the cceptance of and cooperation with FECS by the na- tional and international Authorities concerned, perups by capihasis on the contribution whic F CS could make to their efforts to resolve the refugee problem.

2. Operational headquarters under the direction of a PECS Deputy Director will be in Munich, the point closest to the refugees geographical center : from union the German refugee reception center at Velka and the austri in equivalent at Wels are each within half a day's drive, or less.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

## -22-

3. The Deputy Director will be responsible for the implementation on the operational level in all areas of 11 the functions of F8C3 in line with policies established by the Director. The Deputy Director will be responsible for general operational policy coordination with the national and international authorities and voluntary agencies locally activo.

4. The Deputy Director ill have six Aro Assistunts:

1) North Germany, center Bonn or Hannover.

2) South Germany, ceater munics and Viika

3) US and French cones of Austria, center Salzburg and wels.

4) British Zone Austria and Trieste possibly two assistents

5) Italy, center Home.

6) Paris, London and Bonolux, center ruris.

7) Greece and Turkey, probably will require one area assiв- tant each. However, no field survey of the refugee situation in these two countries has as yet been possible.

The duties of these Assistants will be to provide guidance, inspirtion and close administrative and financial supervision of the various national sections of 930S in their respective aron. Those Area Assistants must have considerable adminie- trative and financil latitusa in order that FOCS may possess the high degree of flexibility essential to its effective ex- ploitation of the fluid refugee situation. They must be fully informed of all employment and emigration ponsibilites, projects of volunt.:ry agencies, etc. Their cooperation and relations with local authorities and ctive agencice must be close and their relstions with them always excellent.

4. PACS will, in each ren where it is to operate, form National Sections. These National Sections will be recruited and appointed by FECS. They may or may not include individu.l represent..tives of org.nitions Tre loclly active. In rare cases in the frontier countries, byt aloost entirely in England and France, prove: exile-organized refugee ald Committees will beccae the local National Sections. In cases where no proven exile-organiced refugee and Committens exist, the FECS Area Assistant will recruit with the help and approval of the Deputy Director a National Section Chief, who will in turn, with the approval of the area Assistant, recruit his own paid assistant or associate where necessary, an. as many as local volunteer section zamber-representatives as may be required by the amount of work, geographical distribution of the refugees, etc.

MEMORANDUM TO: DCI

SUBJECT: Study of Working Relations between NCFE and CIA by IO and AS/S

1. Following upon its assumption of responsibility for the NCFE project, 10, aided by the AS/S, has undertaken over the past two months *has concluded* an investigation into the NCFE/CIA relations. It is apparent that these relations have deteriorated to a dangerous extent and the Agency has lost control of the NCFE activity to a degree it can no longer ignore.

2. In general, the fundamental defect in the relationship is that the NCFE has refused to recognize the legitimate duties and responsibilities of CIA for the policies, financial administration, and security aspects of the NCFE, and the latter has persisted in regarding itself as virtually autonomous. The secondary weakness in the situation has been the inadequacy and confusion of the procedures which were developed to maintain control over and evaluation of NCFE's activities.

3. As examples of the consequences to which these weaknesses have led, the following are cited: (here should be discussed illustrations of specific problems such as those in your para. a.)

4. The remedy which is being developed as a consequence of this investigation is the re-definition of the responsibilities of CIA and authorities of NCFE and the development of new procedures for the conduct of relations between NCFE and CIA. These definitions and procedures have been reduced to a Memorandum of Agreement which has been prepared by CIA and submitted to NCFE for study. A copy of this Agreement is attached as Appendix A. The Senior Vice President of the NCFE has reviewed this Agreement in detail and has prepared his comments thereon, a copy of

SECRET
Security Information


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 137

which is attached as Appendix B. In brief, those comments bear out in instance siter instance the assertions sot forth above as to the fundamon- tal difficulties with which we are faced in the administration of this project.

5. The PRC already has reviewed this Aprocment and the 1953 fiscal year budget subritted by NCFE. The Corrittoo is so convinced of the woakness the present situation and the need for its improvement along the lines suggested by the Nomorandun of Agrocment that it has rofused to approve the budist of the NCFE until a satisfactory Kemorandum of and the budget resubmitted Agreement is concluded in the manner prescribed therein.

6. There is, a choice batuwon basically only two tematives, viz., CIA either has a duty and responsibility to ensure, affima- tively, the caduct of the NCFE program in accordance with CIA's own special mission general responsibilities as a Government agency, or The NCFE is an autonomous organization operating indopendently of any Govercrent direction and controlel, in which event this Agency should formally scicate the responsibilities with which it has been charged in this connection.

I was glad of our meeting day before yesterday and

Here is a memorandum I addressed to A. a short time

some indication of how we are trying to get to work hero.
It is for your eyes only.

I talked to Min on the telephone this morning and he
seamed in an extremely bellicose moss. This bellicosity,
replete with references to "little people who get in his
hair", "from now on I'm dealing oniy with the top", and
"otherwise there are going to be soms resignations here"
is difficult for me because I as partly Irish, and as ablo
to resign as the next man. I have succeeded, however, in
maintaining my Scotch heritage to the Core so far, and
since you assure me that none of this is personally directed
at myself, or people like Bill Dirkes woon I persuaded to
come and help me or to the job that I am sincerely and
honestly trying to do, I will try te keep it there. It was
nevertheless awfully calming to have a chance for such a

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Crusade for Freedom

3-5308

1. Admiral Miller will call upon the DDCI soon to request more funds for the Crusade for Freedom. At the present rate of expenditure, funds will run out on 31 December.

2. $488,991 was budgeted for the Crusade this year. We have told Admiral Miller that since the Crusado was unable to live within this budget, we were certain that the Agency would appropriate more money to wind it up, although we have explained that his request was embarrassing because the PRC had expressly approved $456,991 instead of a larger amount in the belief that less money should be expended this year. We have asked Admiral Miller to provide us with a financial statement of the Crusade cost to date as well as a breakdown of the further amount needed.

3. The Crusade this year has so far cost only a quarter of last year's expenditure and half of the amount exponded in 1950. Receipts are up, 140% over last year at this date. On the whole, a much better job has been done to date than we anticipated -- and purely in terms of the amount raised the performance has been superior.

4. There is a good deal of gossip about the use of Crusade funds and I think you should be acquainted with it. Because the Crusade is a rather public enterprise, the gossip has occasionally been sounded not only within NCFE and this Agency but also among "semi-witting" private citizens who have been enlisted for short-term fund-raising on an unpaid basis. The gossip is that a good deal of money has found its way into the private hands of local Crusade chairmen and workers. In one instance, it is said, involving a local chairman in Minnesota, the amount which reached private hands was enough to build a new home. Another story I have heard repeated by different people on different occasions is that in the state of Nevada and certain other locales no money received by fund-raising chairmen last year was ever türned in to Headquarters, and no report ever made. Another item which some

of the people in the New York office talk about is the payment of $37,500 to Fred C. Smith, who worked for approximately one month in drawing up a Dimes for Freedom campaign which, as you recall, was rejected as a basis for this year's campaign.

5. No accounting of Crusade funds expended in the field has ever been made, and in a fund-raising campaign it is perhaps impossible to do so. Nevertheless, recorde involving payments for expense money to private citizens ongaged for the duration of the campaign are chaotic. You will recall that Spencer Phenix, Treasurer of NCFE, refuses to have anything to do with expenditures for the Crusade.

6. Since we are winding up the Crusade this year and will attempt to place it on a more reliable basis through the Heritage Foundation, I suggest that you assure Admiral Miller that funds sufficient to wind up the Crusade will be forthcoming and that you instruct the 10 Division to expedite a project granting these funds. I further suggest that in view of the allegations above, which I repeat for your private background information, you keep the position of the Agency faultless by requesting from Admiral Miller a budget in as much detail as possible for the amount necessary to liquidate the Crusade.

MEMORANDUM TO: Acting Deputy Director (Administration)

FROM: Acting Chief, Administrative Staff (Special)

SUBJECT: Conference with TPTONIC Management re TPTONIC/CIA Agreement

1. On 9 July 1952 Mr. Echols and I conferred with the President and the Treasurer of the TPTONIC organization regarding the fiscal portion of the proposed Agreement to be reached between CIA and TFTONIC.

2. The purpose of the conference was to extend to the TPTONIC management an offer of aid in the interpretation and implementation of the fiscal phase of the Agreement in response to TOIMC's request for assistance in this connection.

3. Our statement of the Agency's position may be summarized briefly as follows:

a. The Agency is insistent upon obtaining the detailed information regarding TONIC's activities which is essential in order to fulfill the Agency's fundamental policy, fiscal, and security responsibilities. The great size to which TONIC has grown makes it necessary for the Agency to take a closer interest in, TONIC's activities than it has in the past.

b. Although final concurrence in an Agreement has not bean reached by TONIC, it is necessary that revision of the financial budget be commenced immediately if PRC budget approval is to be obtained as soon as possible after a final Agreement has been reached. The budget document must be expanded in order to provide reasonably detailed information not only as to proposed changes from the previous year's activities but also regarding the continuing activities as well. Without this additional information there is lacking sufficient data on which to base the approval of any allotment of funds.

4. The President assured us that a revision of the budget would be undertaken immediately to provide not only the information the Agency requires but also to eliminate incompletely planned, vaguely foreseen requirements. He assured us that the revision would be completed in time to permit a review, prior to its presentation to the PRC, for the purpose of determining that the document attains the standards set forth in the Agreement. The Treasurer concluded that he was sufficiently familiar with the terms of the fiscal portion of the Agreement to be able to satisfy its requirements, but promised to call upon us if he should desire further clarification.

5. In orior to avoid later casunderstandings wo set forth briefly the concept of financial control contemplated in the budot soction of the Agrooment. Wo noted that the Agency must have confidence that the programs of the various TOMIC divisions are carried out to the approximato axtont proposed in the Agency approved budget since other Agency plans must be synchronized harmoniously with TOMC's approved program. Accordingly, the principle of establishing an expenditure coiling for each of the TOUIC divisions is regarded by the Agency as fundamental with which intor-division transfers without Agency approval would be incompatible. We assured the Prosicent it positivoly was not the intent of the Agency to lift managerial responsibility from TONIC's own hands, and that the controls contemplated by the Agreement are almod not at stifling managerial activity but rather to the attainment of the minimum chocks which the Agency fools it must insiot upon in view of the scope and importance of the TOEIC program in the fulfilment of the Agency's own responsibilities and mission.

6. The President expressed hie appreciation of the Agency's viowpoint in the mattor of financial control although he did not expressly commit TONIC to its adoption. He did, however, promise to undertake a point by point review of the terms of the Agreement immediately so that the specific areas of doubt or disagreement may be localized and disposed of in further negotiations.

7. This Staff feels that thore is in reality no misunclorotankiing of the Agreement on the part of TONIC nor any lack of technical confidence to carry out its tems. The problem of attaining and understanding, thoro- fore, comes to nothing more than a determination by TONIC management to accept the minimum of control upon which the Agency is insistent.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT:

National Committee for Free Europe; proposed employment of Mr. Leland Stowe.

REFERENCE:

Hemo from Security Officer to DCI dated 12 January, and attachments.

1.  As the result of an extensive consideration of the problem created by the NCFE offer of employment to Leland Stowe, and in light of the adverse information concerning Mr.Stowe's past connections and affiliations with certain organizations, it was decided by the Director upon the recommendations of Massrs. Dulles, Hedden and the undersigned that Mr. Stowe should not be employed by NCFE as Chief of the RFE information collection program.

2.  When Admiral Miller was informed today of this decision, together with the reasons upon which it was based, he and his staff immediately proceeded to re-examine the entire problem and within an hour-and-one-half communicated to the undersigned an entirely new proposition concerning Mr. Stowe, of which the following were the principal elements:

a. In line with the Director's decision, Mr. Stowe would not be employed by NCFE as Chief of the information collection activity of RFE.

b. In lieu thereof he would be offered a contract as a "consultant and contributor of information" for a six-months term.

c. He would not be offered a salary but would be placed on a fee basis, and paid according to the amount of work and material which he contributes.

d. Thus he will not become an official of RFI or NCPE, and will not be in such a position as to enable anyone to maintain that he guides the policy of or controls the flow of information to Radio Free Europe.

e. Subject to prior aproval from our security office, Admiral Miller and Mr. Lang will endeavor to securo the services of either Mr. Cy Burgin of the Time-life organization, or Mr. Russell Hill of the New York !lerald Tribune as Chief of the information collection activity of Radio Free Europe. They are both regarded as co potent and experienced individuals, and Mr. Hurgin has already indicated his interest in this position if it were open.

3. The proponal described in the preceding paragraph was submitted to Mr. Dulles and to Mr. Braden by the undersigned, and they both exprossed their approval. Mr. Dulles sald that, on the basis of aur discussion with the Director, he folt cortain that this arrangemont would be acceptable from the standpoint of CIA. The Admiral was so advised by the undersigned and expressed himself as being entirely satisfied and very pleased. He undertook to check through Mr. Eraden on the acceptability from a security standpoint of Messrs. Burgin and H111.

4. One other aspect of this matter is worth recording for future reference: Mr. Hedden has stated that he has been woll acquainted with Mr. Stowo for many years, having known him in college and having followed his carcer rather closely. On the basis of everything ho. knowa about Mr. Stowe, Mr. Hedden is convinced that Mr. Stowe 18 a loyal American citizen and that there would be no real risk in his case on the issue of loyalty as such. In the opinion of Mr. Hedden, Mr. Stove's past proclivity for becoming involved with left-wing move-mente (some of them presently regarded as subversive) is not a commentary on his loyalty but rather on his judement. At times bofore and during the war he was prone to hop onto popular bandwagons and to take a line in his writinge and broadcasts that seemed to be popular at the time. In other words, he is an opportuntat by nature and prone to take up causer which appeal to him as having wide popular interest and support as of any given moment. This propensity on the part of Mr. Stowo is not without its professional and commercial aspects.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Transmittal of Papers on NCFE Views on Yugoslavia

1. Here are NOPE's views on Yugoslavia which you asked for.

2.  I am worried about item d) in particular. The other items may be justifiable on the grounds that we have to take care of people in this country, but item d) may seem to be taking unnecessary forward steps.

3. As you suggested, we have asked the State Department for a review of the entire national council policy, and I am sure we will get State's views on Yugoslavia at this time.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Briefing of Secretary of the Army on 17 December on NCFZ and CFA

1. On 17 December, I briefed Secretary of the Army Pace on the subjects of the National Committee for a Free Europe and the Committee for a free Asia.

2. The briefing covered both physical assets and concepts. Secretary Pace asked many questions, for example:

a. How did NCFZ handle the problem of Yugoslav exiles and at the same time use the Yugoslavian defection as an argument in its broadcasts to Iron Curtain countries?

b. How much did the State Department have to say about the day-to-day operations?.

c. The duties of the President?

In addition, he expressed great enthusiasm over the concept of the two Committees and in general for the concept of covert psychological warfare. He interrupted at one point to talk at some length about his belief that while it was essential to continue to draft boys as soldiers and produce rifles, it was just as essential, and in the long run more conducive to ultimate peace, to wage the argument for democracy to a questioning world in a covert manner. He indicated that he thought very little of the government's overt propaganda program and that from what he knew about the government's covert program as conducted by CIA, it was the effective means to the end.

I would certainly be inclined to agree with FOW on the importance of a dignified "worthy cause" sort of campaign. Moreover I would scrupulously avoid any activity which might cast doubt on the good faith of the Crusade (e.g., "We save our money for balloons at Christmas - where are they?")

MEMORUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT: Proposed Campaign of the Crusade for Freedom (ER 2-0686).

1. Please note the attached Inquiry from Tom Braden, in which he raises two questions with respect to balloons. The following are my recommendations on the two questions, respectively:

a. I see no objection to reference by the Freedom Crusade campaign to the use of balloons, provided this is handled with care. By this I mean that it would be all right for the Crusade to refer to its former use of balloons and the effectiveness of this use, and also to say that the National Committee for a Free Europe will, on an appropriate occasion and at the right time, make further use of balloons. It would be wrong and unwise for many reasons to make a flat statement as to the exact time and content of further balloon operations. There is no point in thus telegraphing our punch to the opposition, and it would get us into trouble if we were to be too specific about the timing and subject matter of any new messages.

b. I would be very much opposed to the stunts such as dropping Christmas leaflets out of balloons over packed football stadiums. This is the kind of flamboyant publicity which we have agreed not to undertake this year, and incidentally which makes us look as though we were in the class with commercial advertisers or irresponsible and playful student *pranksters*, or both. I thought Abbott Washburn had gone to help Ike!

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Request for Decision as to whether Crusade for Freedom Campaign Boginning 15 November may use a Dropping of Leaflets Theme in its Propaganda.

Executive Registry
3-0686

1. Admiral Miller of NCFE has appointed a new head for Crusado for Freedom, Mr. Richard Walsh, formerly of the State Department. Mr. Walsh has submitted a new plan for the Crusade for Freedom campaign to begin November 15. The campaign will be based upon the idea of sending Christmas message leaflets behind the iron curtain with publicity that the Crusade for Freedom will use balloons among other methods for this purpose. It was originally contemplated that the Crusade would in fact send balloons as it did last year. Bearing in mind, however, the DCI's warning about using any propaganda device which might give the Soviet a weapon in its bactoriological warfare campaign, we have instructed the Crusade that there will be no actual transmission of balloons.

2. Will it be permissible for the Crusade to publicize the use of balloons, to employ such stunts as dropping the Christmas leaflets out of balloons over packed football stadiums in the United States and to give the general impression that balloons will be one of tho ways to carry messages from the American people behind the iron curtain, even though they will in fact not be employed?

3. You will appreciate that an immediate decision is essential.

MEMORANDUM FOR: MR. WALTER FORZHETHER
Office of the General Counsel

SUBJECT: Follow-up on your report of 26 June 1952 re: Captain Stanislaw Vakiorka.

1. The following report of 2 July 1952, is a reply to our presentation to the Admiral of the subject report:

"I have questioned Tom about the matter cited in your letter of 30 June 1952, File Number-3039. Tom states that the facts are as follows:

1. By letter dated March 20, 1952, Congressman Robert Tripp Rose requested consideration for the employment of Captain Uskierka. The latter was interviewed on several occasions, and prospects of his employment were fully examined. After careful consideration, it developed that Oskierka was not useful in any division of our operation, and there was no job for him. He was personally informed by Tom in a subsequent interview on May 6, 1952, in which Oskierka expressed his understanding of the situation.

2. Under date of May 23, 1952, Congressman Ross again wrote us stating that Oskierka had contacted him again about the possibilities of a job with us. I wrote the Congressman under date of June 5, 1952, telling him that, although we had made every effort to place him, we were unable to offer Vakiorka a position.

3. On or about June 25, 1952, Congressman Ross' local secretary telephoned my office inquiring about Oskierka. My secretary referred her to Tom who then talked at some length with Congressman Ross' secretary. He told the latter that we had no position for Uskierka and that we had so informed the Congressman by letter above cited. In the course of the conversation, the secretary inquired as to what suggestions we could offer relative to such a position for Vakierka as would be useful in procuring an extension of his visitor's visa. Tom stated that he might suggest to the Congressman that he might make inquiry in Uskierka's behalf in various government agencies in Washington, stating that Vakierka seemed to have various useful talents which might interest someone other than us.

4. Tom has never talked with Congressman Ross. Tom did not state to his secretary or to anyone else that Congress an itors' candidate might be able to get a position with you. Ton states that he knows better for obvious reasons than to make any such suggestion to anyone.

FROM:

SUBJECT: Captain Stanislaw Uskiorka

There are no prospects for utilizing
Captain Uskierka's services by the Fund.

I must say that I do not like the behavior of Oskiorka in again trying to pressure us via Congressman Ross. As the attached file shows, he has been most courteously treated here; every effort has been made to place him; and he has expressed himself as being pleased with the treatment and attention accorded him. I personally informed him and explained in great detail that his background made it impossible for us to use him here. He stated to me that he thoroughly understood this and that he was quite satisfied that we had examined the proposition throughly.

I don't suppose that it can be told to Congressman Ross, but Bernie Yarrow has taken his whole story to certain of our friends to explore the possibilities of their possible interest in him since he stated to me that he is single and willing to go anywhere in the world to get into the fight.

1. The following report was made available to us by Eugene Lyons, former President of the American Coxumittee, who still actively partici- pates in Committee activities ae a policy advisor. Fr. Lyons 18-a mem- ber of the Board of Directors of the American Friends for Russian Free- dom, and he achined this report from an unnamed source in the American Friends' organization.

2. A man nered Verbitsky (fru), living in Munich, has somehow managed to obtain the personal files of Georgi Mueller, the NTS safe- house keeper wo es arrested as a Soviet agent last fall. These files contain, among other things, a number of letters to Mueller from Gregori Klimov, an influential emigre who is head of the emigre group known as the League of Fort Har Defectors. These letters involve Klimov in Mueller's activities, and, implicate many other emigres. Verbitsky attempted to tom these documents crer to unnamed authorities in the field; when he was ignored by these authorities, he mailed the entire parcel to Senator Joseph EcCarthy.

3. The American Comittee naturally considers that this corres- pondence, which, if it exists, no doubt contains a great deal of that unfounded denonciation and allegation which is se typical of emigre expression, may involve the American Committee as well as other matters of particular concern to the Agency.

4. The Crief, SR Division, has been made aware of this report.

FOR MR. BRADEN

1.  Professor Richard V. Burks of Wayne University is chairman of a small team of scholars engaged in a study of the European satellites.

2.  The findings of this team are being given as the content of a course on the mid-European area. They are also, I believe, being breadcast.

3.  The time of Professor burks and his group is being purchased by the Mid-Suropean Study Center which is, as you may know, ander Er. Stetson Holmes.

4.  As yet Berks has no definite plan for the publication of his findings. Manifestly, the kind of book which would emerge from his research would have to receive some sort of subsidy. As you know, Looks of this sort, if they are considered important enough, are publiched as loss leaders by university presses. Also, as you doubtless know, university presses are in pretty straitened circumstances these days. If the Wayne University Press -- the normal place for the publication of Burks' book -- were to consider publishing the book, it might be able to publish it only with outside assistance. The figure would run probably between $1500 and 2000.

5.  In my opinion Burks is one of the most competent, if not the most competent man in the United States in this general field of investigation. Anything he turns out will be about as good as it comes. Aitrough I have not seen any of this most recent work, my hunch is that it will be enormously valuable to the policy-raker and us estimators when the time cores for sere deep thinking and critical decisions about the European satellites.

6.  I thout ce might be interested in the above, and with a little poking round yourself might feel inclined to give the venture wintever kind of boost seers appropriate.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Current activities and behavior of Grigoire
Gafencu.

REFERENCE: Paris 06.15 (IN 37959) dated 28 November 1953.

1. The reference telegram from Paris contains a recommendation that NCFE do what it can to prevail upon Gafencu to come back to the United States and engage himself in certain activities which may be of some use and value to NCFE. The following information was obtained yesterday from Mr. Tyler who is familiar with the background of the reference message.

2. Mr. Tyler stated that Mr. John Hushes has become somewhat concerned about the activities and behavior of Cafencu in Europe, and more especially in and armund Paris, and although he does not believe that a major issue needs to be made of this matter, he is firmly of the opinion that Cafencu is not doing anything useful for the NCFE in Europe and that the net effect of his activities is somewhat to the disadvantage of the interests of the United States. Carencu 18 bolieved to be maintaining a rather close association with Guy de la Tournelle (sp?) and his wife, who are described as "very sour apples and bitter opponents of DC." Gafencu is also reported to have been involving himself with certain businessmen in France in a series of questionable oil promotion schemes. He is also reported to have been engaged in organizing a kind of information center in emigre circles and to be selling this information to Agence France Presse. Moreover,.
   Gafencu has been selling himself and "throwing his weight around" on the basis of representations and strong intimations that he is a close and intimate friend of Mr. Allen Dulles. liis utterances in this ге- card are regarded by Mr. Hughes as highly indiscreet, the more so since he appears to te living and entertaining on a scale sufficiently lavish to suggest that he is being provided with substantial funds -- well above the allowance granted to him by NCHE.

3. Mr. Hughes, as well as the Paris Station, fully appreciates that NCFE is not in a position to force the return of Cafencu to the United States. At the same time, he believes that NCFE should do

all that it can to get him out of Paris and he recommends that a strong invitation be extended by NCFE to Gafencu to return to the United States, and that this invitation be coupled with a statement to the effect that in view of budgetary considerations and the very marginal value of Gafencu's activities in Europe, it will not be possible for NCFS to continue his stipend unless he returns to the United States and engages himself in activities more useful to the program of NCFE.

P. S. Since dictating this memorandum, I have received a report from a well-informed Rumanian source to the effect that Gafencu has returned to the United States within the past few days for the purpose of remaining here indefinitely. (The fact of Gafencu's return to the US has been positively established, and it is possible that within the next day or so confirmation will be obtained concerning his longer-range future intentions.) My Rumanian informant has told me that the real reason for Gafencu's return was an urgent request from Malaxa, who feels that he requires Gafencu's present in the United States to assist him (Malaxa) in government circles, etc. My Rumanian source is prejudiced against Malaxa, but has maintained contact with Gafencu notwithstanding this, and is convinced that Cafercu is still on Malaxa's pay roll and subject to Malaxa's demands for this reason.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

Conversation with Lee Pennington

1.  On Friday, 11 December, I had a conversation with Lee
    Pennington, formerly of the FFI and recently appointed director of
    the National Americanism Commission of the American Legion.

2.  Pennington was most cordial. He showed me a letter which
    he had written to the members of the Americanism Commission of the
    Legion in which he dismissed charges against WVF based principally
    on an attack by Kurt Glaser. The arguments he used in his letter
    he had drawn from briefings by this Agency. He thinks that this
    will be the end of the matter and that members of his Commission
    will no longer press for investigation of NCL and WVF.

3.  I took this opportunity to brief Pennington thoroughly on
    the World Veterans Federation which the Director had previously
    mentioned to him and about which he had had a little information,
    most of it false. He had been under the impression that we had
    something to do with it out that it was a left-wing outfit which
    we were investigating. At the end of our conversation he told me
    that he was thoroughly satisfied with the information I gave him
    and that he would take two steps in accordance with my request:

a.  He would notify the Ford Foundation that the legion
looked upon the World Veterans Federation as a worthwhile
outfit and would certainly not criticize the Foundation if
it were to make a grant to the organization.

b.  He said he would prevent any attacks on the organiza-
tion coming from Legion members being given serious con-
sideration. He said that this could be taken care of by
referring all such attacks to the Americanism Commission for
study.

Dear D'Arcy:

This is in reference to your telephone call of this afternoon. I have just had a full report on the matter of the seven visitors.

I am afraid you have got yourself on the hock on this one and nothing can be done about it except to go through with the bargain you made. This bargain, the documents indicate, was to bring the seven Czecha over here and take the responsibility you assumed when you signed the seven declarations of support affidavits.

Now having gotten that bad news off my chest, I hasten to add that I do not think this is going to be burdensome w you. You are doing a real public service, as I shall explain in a moment, and all of us will do our level dost to help you.

I realize that you did not think you wero assuring the responsibility for seven people. It is clear, however, that everyone else thought you were, and I think it is maply too late to change it now. The Csuch rezime is attacking the United States for its handling of enigres; it is attacking the camps which you have seen; it is pointing un the general hopelessness of an emiyre's Lot and the dullness and dreariness which you have noted at first had. This litala trip of our seven friends has set all the refugee circles in Geramy gossiping. It is exciting news. It is undoubtedly known behind the Curtain. To call it off now would make a real diferenco -- not test in torre of the Crusade, but in terms of vant raingeen think about the United States and United States citizens.

The procedure from res on seems to lay itself out as follow৪:
The seven refugees will arrive sometime during the month of December. Tus arrival dato is important. HICCO has made every effort to orpedite it so that they can come in December, and aly overdelning ressons ought to dictate a postponement. They will go to work and do whatever you, Clyde and food want them to do on behalf of the Crusade. After their work for the Crusade is over, all seven doubtless will wish to remic in the United States. We will all then jointly try wind Jobs and places for then. The visas are good mail next April, but if they can find Jobs here it will probably be possible for us to secure special legislation for them to stay an indefinitely.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 171

-2-

Now as to the questione you raise in your lotter of November 24th. The National Committee for a free Europe should certainly look after these peorlo when they arrive and while they are here except insofar as they are directed by you to take up certain activities on behalf of the Crusade. The National Committee should also cooperate in trying to help you in your effort to find jobs for then wien their tour is over, and I we sure the people there will do their bost. I am sending a copy of this note to hitnoy and I know that he will cooperato to the fullest.

As to your secciat question, I trink the expenses of all seven ought to be paid for out of Crusade funds. They are over hero on behalf of the Crusade Hund you aru the one who asked them to come.

On the third question, as I indicated above, I think it would be a great blow to Culted States polictes in this field if they were s turn around alter Wheir cuties were over and limp back to a dusty refugee camp.

I think the is the way the whole thing ought to rost now and I do moet earnestly urge you not to be too concerned about your personal meponsibilities. We will all be lucky if we have to tackle no tougher problams.

Sincerely,

# REFERENCE:

1.  Pemorandum to Chief, SE from Deputy Director (Plans), dated 5 November 1953- Subject: Rumanian National Council

1. In agreement with Mr. William Durkee of International Organisations Division, I share your view, as stated in paragraph 3 of the referenead motorandus, that Hr. Anthony Panuch should discuss the problem of the organization of Funanian rofugees with the SCE rather than with this Agency. We were informed by Mr. Durkee that Mr. Panuch is fully aware of the ECPE position that the refugees should resolve their own differences before presenting a solution for the consideration of the ECFE. Mr. Durkeo also informed the Rumanian Branch on 13 November that he had discussed this matter with Mr. Whitney Theyardson who concurred in the view stated above.

2. With reference to Mr. Panach's statement that the "League in its present state is a useful operational vehicle," namo traces reveal that fourteen members are Iron Quardists, five are suspected communist agents and four admit that they are on Nicolae Malaxa's payroll. Because of this unsavory composition, it appears unlikely that the League as presently composed would be useful operationally.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Southeastern European Division

SUBJECT: Rumanian National Council

1. The attention of the SS Division and Measrs. Braden and Darkes is invited to the attached copy of a letter which I have just received from J. Anthony (Joe) Fanuch concerning certain recent developments in the Rumanian emire situation and with particular reference to the "league." You will note that Mr. Panuch has indicated that if we are interested in the League and its possibilities, he would be glad to talk to us about it.

2. I believe that the addressees of this memorandus will recall the elunificence of Mr. Panuch and the role which he has played recently, including his visit to me of about two or three months ago. (I was annoyed by and considered as a minor breach of conficence the reference which was made to my name in the material which was published concerning a communication acrossed to King Kicisel, although I did note that this contained no representation that I had taken a position one way or another concerning the Learue or the proposed formula for resolving differences between the two principal Rumanian emire factions.)

3. As regards the proposal of further conversations between Mr. Panuch and either myself or some other spokesman or representative of this Agency, I continue to be inclined to the view that these are matters which should be taken up by Mr. Fanuch with Mr. Shepardson and not ourselves. If after consultation between the 7. Division and ID Division it is agreed that this is the correct position, I should appreciate it if Mr. Braden or Mr. Durkee could talk with Mr. Shepardson about this letter and obtain his views for my benefit. I would then be in a better position to reply to Mr. Panuch's letter - presumably telling him that in line with my earlier advice to him, I still would recommend that he raise these matters with KOPK and not CIA. I could also add that i had been troubled by the appearance of my name in the published material referred

to above and cite this as an example of why I would prefer to stay out of the matter directly.

Is. A copy of this memorandum is furnished to Mr. Houston because of his knowledge of the background of the old Malaza allegations, and the difficulties which Malaza is capable of creating for the Agency in the future. It will be recalled that Halasa has charged that CIA has injected itself into the matter of his immigration status; that I have wrongfully involved myself in his affairs -- including some ridiculous charge that i kept him from getting a lucrative contract with the California Steel Company, etc., etc. -- none of which has any foundation in truth whatsoever.

Dear Frank:

Re: Romanian National Council

This is to bring you up to date on the aftermath of our conference at June 17th with respect to the above. On my return to New York I took the following steps:

1. Personally submitted the settlement formula to Hica Georgescu for mediation with Visolanu and Crotsianu, and to Larry Delleufville for the information of the NCFH. Rica, in my opinion unwisely, took the position that the formula was not negotiable.

2. Directed the League to transmit the formula to King Mihail for his information and action and, panding final acceptance or rejection to "iny off" visavis Crotzianu, visoinnu ot al. This was done.

3. Summoned Malaxa and the officials of the League to (a) inform them of the false charges made to the White House by Malaxa against you in 1951 and to demand their formal retractions; and (b) insist that Malaxa immediately make good on his commitment to General Racescu that he set up an independent "no strings attached" budget for the League -- an undertaking, then six months in default. Malaxa agreed to comply will both commands and asked for time to the beginning of September when he hoped he would be released of the strain and mental anguish incident to his chronic immigration proceeding. Malaxa defaulted on both promises.

4. I issued an ultimatum to the leaders of the League to tha effect that irrespective of my friendship with General Radescu, unless they disassociated themselves completely from Pelaxa and any semblance of his influence -- direct or indirect -- I would resign as the League counsel. This severance of their relationship with Malaxa has been accomplished after a stormy showdown session between Parcasanu and Niculescu and Halava.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

Mr. Frank Wioner

The League in its present state is in my opinion a useful operational vehicle in any Romanian situation in which the utilization of skilled and experienced personnel (notably Farcasanu and Niculescu) of conservative and non-Marxist political orientation is indicated. If you are at all interested in it as such, I should be glad to talk to you about it.

With best regards,

Faithfully,

Dear Mr. Glaser:

I have read your article on Radio Free Europe - THE "RUSSIA FIRST" BOYS IN RADIO "FREE EUROPE" - and I must say that it agrees with the facts as I know them. It is regrettable that such knowledge or information cannot get to the masses of the American public. I have visited the State Department and te National Committee for a Free Europe several times during the past two years to aprize them of the situation, but it seems they do not choose to do much about it. I had my information directly and indirectly from Slovak refugees in Germany and Austria....and London. In December, 1951, the ASSOCIATION OF SLOVAKS IN GREAT BRITAIN, sent a "Memorandum" to the Nat'l Committee for a Free Europe in New York stating, in effect, the very things your article contains. The personnel of RFE in Munich was given in toto. At that time 51 program editors were employed by 29 Czechs cand 2 Slovaks (renegades). Of the 29 Czechs employed 27 wore SOCIALISTS of one brand or another! The memo mentions who they were... I still have that list. Should you want to use it, you are welcome to it.

I have long been convinced that it is not in the interests of America or other free countries to employ pseudo-left-wingers in the EFE, the Voice of America or other governmental agencies. I simply would not trust them. Your article exactly sizes up the charlatans in RFE or used by the Kremlin I certainly would recommend its publication. I, for one, certainly would!

Sincerely,

P. A. Hrobak

Statement

I read with attention and interest the article "The 'Turcia First boys in odio Free Europe'", by Mr.Birt Closer.

Having no documentation on hand in order to verify all particular affirmations contained in this article, I can express my entire adhesion as to its general line. I lived in Czecho-Slovakia between 1945 and 1946 and I know the policy of the "National Front "Government in Prague at that time from my personal experience.

In order to understand the Marxist tendency of some present politicians groupes in the so-called "Council of Free Czechoslovakia", it is necessary to point out that the Czech National Socialist Party of Mr.Benes, Lr.Zenkl, Lir.Kipko,Lr.Stransky, etc. formed, on June 25th, 1945, the "Front of Working People" with the pro-Communist Social Democratic Party of Dr.Fierlinger, Mr.Lauschman and Kr.Major and with the Communist Party of Mr.Gottwald. That "Front" constituted the closest ring of socialist solidarity and common action within the "National Front" Government composed of two more parties: the Czech Catholics and the Slovak Democrats./See the article "Let us say the truth !", by Dr.Michal Zibrin, former Deputy of Slovak Democratic Party in Prague Parliament, published in "Jednote", on October 29th, 1992, Middletown, Fa./This ring of the three Czech socialist parties is responsible for the evolution in the policy of Crecho-Clovacia until February 1948.

# Radio Europe 'Houses Reds'

Station Got Millions From Americans

By Dr. John B. Crane

Frankfurt. Germany.

"You would do well to make an investigation of Radio Free Europe," a prominent Washington lawmaker advised me a few weeks ago as we were having tea together near Heidelberg.

"I have just returned from Munich," he continued, "where I inspected both the facilities of the Voice of America and of Radio Free Europe. I was much impressed with the Voice of America set-up and find they are doing a very good job."

"But when I called at the plant of Radio Free Europe I got such a frosty reception I could hardly believe it. They tried to be polite but were obviously delighted when I left. I figured maybe they had heard of my vigorous anti-Communist campaign when I ran for re-election."

## Makes Headlines

Within the past month at least, three other visiting American officials have tipped me off that I ought to investigate Radio Free Europe. The climax was reached today when a Washington investigator suddenly appeared at my apartment for a chat and casually announced he was headed for Munich. When I inquired why, he replied:

"I want to inspect Radio Free Europe."

During the past week Radio Free Europe has twice made headlines in leading German periodicals. One important weekly paper, the Rheinischer Merkur, devoted an entire page to the problem of Radio Free Europe.

## 70 Millions from Americans

American readers will doubtless remember with what high hopes this radio broadcasting station was started two years ago under the sponsorship of outstanding private American citizens such as Gen. Lucius D. Clay, former American Military Governor in Germany.

The purpose of the new broadcasting station was to send programs behind the Iron Curtain to Poland, Czechoslovakia and other satellite countries to encourage them to hold out against their Communist Governments.

Millions of Americans welcomed this new weapon in the cold war against communism and contributed 70 million dollars for its support, according to the German press.

Omaha, November 2, 1952

## Anti-German Propaganda

The money was to be spent not only for building and equipping a broadcast station, but also for financing the escape of refugees from countries behind the Iron Curtain and giving them jobs at the new station in Munich.

Now come leading articles in the German press charging that Radio Free Europe is heavily infiltrated with Communists and that pro-Communist, anti-German propaganda is being fed to countries behind the Iron Curtain.

The well-known German weekly, Christ un Welt, states that seven members of the Czech Department of Radio Free Europe have recently been arrested on suspicion of espionage, while one member, after working for several months, was found to be a Communist agent and fled over the border into Czechoslovakia with important personal records of Czecho emigrants' families.

## 'Saw the Light'

The German paper names names and places. For example, it charges that the executive editor of the Czech Division of Radio Free Europe, Pavel Tigrid, was editor of an illegal, Communist paper in 1932 known as Hallo Noviny.

It charges, further, that during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia Tigrid co-operated closely with an important Communist leader, Fucik, who had become editor of the Communist paper Rude Pravo. Tigrid was a contributor to the Communist Central Party organ when the war ended in 1945.

Shortly thereafter, however, he "saw the light" and fled to Germany as a refugee. Soon he was executive editor of the Munich radio station fighting communism.

## Demand Shake-Up

The German paper further mentions name five other prominent employees of Radio Free Europe who were, earlier, Communist Party members or who today have close relatives in important Communist Party posts in Czechoslovakia.

The Germans are demanding a drastic reorganization of Radio Free Europe. This seems to be on the point of being realized. It is reported that 25 employees of the organization have already resigned, and that Executive Editor Tigrid (alias Paul Dittrich) has submitted his resignation.

It is to be hoped that the "housecleaning" now in progress will put an end to the many ugly rumors that have been floating around about Radio Free Europe for the last several months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Monseigneur John C. Kirk

1. You asked me by telephone for a report on subject, who is domestic prolate on leave from the Savannah-Atlanta diocese in Georgia.

2. Monseigneur Kirk was formerly secretary to Archbishop Gerald P. O'Hara, Bishop of the Savannah-Atlanta diocese, and also his secretary While Bishop O'Hara was Apostolic Nuncio to Rumania from 1946 until O'Hara's official expulsion in July of 1950. (NCS has been reliably informed that Kirk remained behind in Rumania disguised as a Swiss tourist. He visited many of the imprisoned hierarchy but eventually escaped. This report is without objective verification.)

3. Because no single member of the Rumanian hierarchy escaped, Kirk was appointed as president of the Rumanian Catholic Mission for Europe. The headquarters of the Mission is now Passeggiata del Gianicolo 5, Rome. Monseigneur Kirk resides at Via Panama 110, Rome.

4. While in the United States in 1952 as personal delegate of Cardinal Tisserant to the convention of the association of Humanian Catholics in America, Kirk visited the office of NCS. Members of the staff met with him on five occasions and made the following estimate:

As a prelate on leave in a southern diocese, Kirk can be classified as a religious liberal interested in the betterment of various classes and, particularly the Negro. In Humanian politics, he vigorously resisted the influence of the iron guard. Evidence of this is that in 1952 Kirk moved the headquarters of the Mission from Madrid, where it was located at Calle de Serrano 30, because of continuing attempts of the iron guardists to use him for political purposes.

5. A detailed account of the principal purposes and scope of the Rumanian Catholic Mission for Europe which Kirk heads is available


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 185

here. Highlights are:

a. Roughly 150,000 people under his jurisdiction.

b. Mission centers have been established in Great Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy, Argentina, Trieste, Spain and France.

c. Kirk is assisted by thirty priests located in the above areas.

6. Kirk is now in the United States and intends to return early in November. He is visiting NCFE in New York next week. His former chief, Archbishop O’Hara is now Nuncio for Ireland with headquarters in Dublin.

7. Statements made by Monseigneur Kirk in visits to NCFE together with extracts from correspondence are available if you should wish me to scan these and form an estimate of my own.

DRAFT

19 October 1953

Jamming of western broadcasts to Russia bagar sporadically in 1948 and vas well established by early 1949, first against VOA then also against BBC. Satellite language program jamming began firat from Russian stations and then from Jamming stations located in the Satellites proper. When RFE transmissions began in 1950, the organisation and equipment were available for the new target..

At the present time, the organization for Jamming including the transmitters, the monitoring stations to watch for the undesired programs, and the control network to direct the jammers to the target - is apparently integrated throughout the Bloo, with a certain amount of cooperation between countries. That is, programs directed to one Satellite country may be jammed not only from within the country but from Russia and from neighboring Satellites.

At least some of the Jammers are closely controlled so that efforts to evade them by changes in frequency or schedules are frequently met by a prompt reaction on the part of the Jammer -- within a minute or less.

The extent of integration of the total Bloc jamming system makes it very difficult to separate the effort contributed within the Satellites. However, it is presently estimated that about 900 transmitters are in the jamming effort within the Bloo, and these appear to be fairly well distributed throughout the total of the frequencies that are being used at any given time. Therefore, at times when RFE is broadcasting to the Satellite countries with a considerable number of frequencies, there are undoubtedly hundreds of transmitters Jamsing these frequencies.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 187

DRAFT

19 October 1953

The effectiveness of the jamming is difficult to assess quantitatively from the few available observation locations within the Orbit and from the fan mail received. Essever, in general, it is apparent that Jamming is most effective in large citiest approaching 100%. In rural areas, the picture varies from time to time and from place to place, but it appears that a considerable proportion of the programs to the Satellites can be received. For example, the RFR monitor in Vienna reported that, at that *location*, the medium frequency Czech broadcast from Holzkirchen on 719 xe vas practically 100% Jammed while only about 50% of the shortwave Czech programs were not intelligible. The Embassy in Warsaw reported in May that while VOA programs were unintelligible, RFE programs were "often intelligible."

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBJECT : Vienna Conference with Ambassador Joseph Flack

1. On 2 September, representatives of RFE and VOA met with Ambassador Joseph Flack and solicited his comments on reported unrest in Foland, and the utility of RFE and VOA Polish broadcasts.

2. With reference to internal disturbances and partisan activities, Flack stated that there have been "absolutely none" in recent weeks, and added that earlier reports of unrest following the June uprisings in East Germany were proved to have been without foundation as a result of relatively unrestricted survey action then taken by numerous representatives of U. S., British and French diplomatic missions in Poland. He expressed his conviction that there is no significant underground organization in Poland which might be considered as an immediate asset by the Best, and empha- sized his belief that serious disturbances would not occur as long as the present Soviet control mochanis retains its power and the Soviet araies in Poland and East Germany go unchallenged. The bitter lessons of World War II, particularly the abortive Narsaw uprisings, and lack of confidence in the Folish emigration defin- itely discourage active resistance. The Foles increasingly tend to resent the action of the emigre leaders, regarding then esse: :tially as, ayabols of failure, and, Flack feels, will undoubtedly develop new leaders from within the country when the time comes for action.

3. Flack carefully distinguished resistance as an immediate asset from resistance as a potential asset. He expressed the belief that the Catholic Church still offers the strongest and the best organised base of resistance in Poland as it is looked upon as the only symbol of continuity and solidarity with the past. To this he added his own appreciation for traditional Folish spirit of independance and Christian orientation, and emphasized his belief that Polish hatred of Russians and communian continues to nount. Unfortunately, similar sentiment persists with reference to Germany. Fear of German occupation or seisure of Polish territory continues to play a prominent part in Polish thought and is cleverly utilised by the Communist government in its propaganda effort.

h. Flack expressed certain misgivings with reference to the character of RFE and VOA broadcasts, emphasising his conviction that Western radio broadcasts should do nothing to compromise the position of the Catholic Church in Poland, always taking as guidance the attitude and statements of the Polish clerical leaders themselves. He strongly urged that all possible stora be taken to maintain the present volume of broadcasts into Polard as a means of preserving hope and belief in the inevitebility of Soviet communisas collapse.

Dear Mr. lidwood:

/ short time ago the question was asked of us whether RCFE would recommend the extension of RFE broadcasting to the Baltic states. The question was made the subject of several papers which were prepared for, and circulated to, and there after discussed it three meetings of the RCFE policy committee.

Following these discussions, the RCFE position is as follows:

Broadcasts of the RFE type (i.e. the type to Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary), directed at the three Baltic countries, would be plainly advantageous to the United States in terms of NCFE's objectives. There are even stronger arguments for starting such broadcasts at once than there were for starting them two years ago. However, now, as during the 1951 discussions, the problem rises whether such broadcasts (Voices of Free Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) cannot without damage to diplomatic usage -- be handled by the Voice of America. The fact that the Soviet occupation of the Baltic nations has never been recognized by the Government of the United States would appear to remove the restraints under which the Voice of America must operate where the local government has an American diplomatic mission accredited to it.

If the Voice of America can transmit Voices of Free Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, we would not want to compete with them and would consider it preferable that they should do the job with the whole prestige of the non-recognition policy of the United States Government behind them. If we knew for certain that the Voice is not going to handle the task (which would be a different one and in addition to what we believe to be their present transmissions in the Baltic languages) then we would add the baltic nations to the list of unfinished business to which RFE must direct its attention whenever sufficient resources become available.

However, sufficient resources are far from being available at the present time, and, urgent as are the needs of the Baltic listening audience in the present period of ferment:tion of freedom throughout the satellite area, our first task must necessarily be to hold the audiences we already have in the face of the electronic war that is being waged against our transmissions by enemy jamming. RFE's original budget for 1953-54 was based on an orderprogram to maint: in present gains in the three main targets (Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary)

and to develop our present scanty capabilities in Fulgeria, and the lesser targets of Romania, and Albania. The original budget cut of about 1,500,00, ne Fellowed by a second cut of 1,000,000, make it doubtful if RFE can even mintain fel! audience-rorching capabilities to all of its main target areas, let lene maintaining the seenty capabilities to the other targets mentioned above. Indeed, the LOVE Board of Trustees 111 pro bly vote on September isth (1) not to expand Bal-gerien brodents, (11) to shorten Rom nien broadents, and (lii) to elimin: to broadents to sinis.

To enter the Baltic gres, as a real and not teken target, veuld (I am informed by RF) cost additional sumse morey several times groter than the cuts that have recently been made. Much so we would like to see this new are opened up in what is generally regarded as "RFE style", either by VOA or ourselves, I see no hore of RFE's being able to undertake the task until their budget alloc:tions can not only reach, but substantially exceed, the mount needed to preserve existing programs (egainst enemy interference) st their existing audience-reaching level. And certainly if such budget additions were in sight, it would be necessary for us to consider, longside the Baltic plan, the relative desirability of:

(a) Strengthening still further the signal to the three principal targets,

(b) Initiating the often discussed pian for in-stalling transmitters in Turkey or Greece for reaching Romania and Bulgaria more effectively,

(c) Broadcasting to Albania as more important target than the Baltic states.

Cone usion:

Unless it is red rded as of pramount national in-teret that RFE type broadcasts be made to the Eltic states; and

Unless it is clear that Vos is not in a position to provide such programs; and

Unless it is clear that such development by SFE is more important thing

Miss McCrum:

I have a feeling that no one on our side is prepared to keep a firm hand on the Jean Paul David trip.

David is himself a king-sizo free wheeler. Although he is unquestionably one of the French "doers," as opposed to "talkers," in this field, he is also quite a big-mouth and inclined to over-talk, over-promise and over-indulge in cloak-and-dagger stage setting. U he hasn't got a guard, armed to the teeth, with a beret and a half-burned cigarette glued to his underlip, lurking outside the dining-room, he can't enjoy hię meal.

The plot is complicated by the fact that as far as the U. S. Is concerned he has always been strictly covert. This time he arrives as strictly "overt" so no one on our side will really know how to behave since everyone will have to do and be the exact opposite of what they did and were during David's last trip.

I would suggest that you show the attached to Abbott Washburn, George Morgan, Tom Braden and/or Bill Durkee, and Joe Phillips (also this note) and suggest that they work out who should consider himself responsible. I personally hope Joe Phillips will be willing to take it on.

Incidentally, the American who handles David best is Helen Kirkpatrick. She might conceivably be drafted as chaperone for this trip.

COPY

The following is from a dispatch written by Mr. William Tyler, dated 22 June 1953.

1. After a recent conversation with Jean Paul David, at which time he outlined his activities and ideas in connection with the mission with which he is charged by Georges Bidault, I received a letter from him.

2. It will be seen from this letter that David is most anxious that the report which he will make on his survey should represent, without committing any one country, a systhesis of the views and the resources of the Western powers allied under NATO, in the broad field of propaganda and psychological warfare designed to build support for Western defense policy and to promote the achievement of the objectives of these policies.

3. It occurs to me that a difficulty which we have to face, and which we are probably unique in having to face, is due to the organisational structure within which we operate officially in the general field under discussion. In a country like Italy, for example, it is possible for David to have exchanges of views with high officials of the government and to feel reasonably sure that even though such views are not to be taken as a commitment, they do in fact represent the disposition of the government in question, or any government likely to succeed it, toward these problems. In our case, however, it seems to me that it will requiro careful preparation to determine with whom David should consult and to work out a constructive position which will influence his report and his recommendations in a direction which we approve.

4. It is particularly difficult for me to make specific recommendations, since developments in Washington in the last few months are difficult to keep up with from overseas. It would, therefore, be particularly helpful to have headquarters' views at this stage on the following points, assuming that David will go to the States in late September on the last leg of his survey:

a. With whom should he mest for basic discussions. (It occurs to me that a suitable body, if still in existence, would be the Psychological Operations Coordinating Committee.)

b. Within what limits at this time are we prepared to discuss the problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of the North Atlantic Community.

5. As headquarters is aware, C. D. Jackson knows David personally, and it would perhaps be useful to arrange for conversations with him and any group he might have in mind. It is true that the position of David with regard to this Agency is anomalous, since the survey on which he is engaged, far from relating to covert operations, is of the most official

kind possible. As headquarters has pointed out, his interests in his present mission in reality pertain more to the State Department and NATO than to us, and it seems to me that we should not be in the direct line of fire except in the capacity of individual observera or participants in the conversations he will have. It would, therefore, seem to be all the more important that we arrive at a clear understanding among ourselves as to how David's trip to the States will be organised and what is to be the respective role of the component elements in the psychological effort with regard to his survey.

Translation of Letter from Jean-Paul David

June 19, 1953

My dear Bill,

You know that - probably toward the end of Septomber- I am to leave for the United States on a mission entrusted to me by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Mr. Bidault is concerned - and justly so, about the problems connected with the objectives of my survey, and my desire is to produce a realistic report since I wish to avoid (you know my way of thinking) the traditional phraseology which generally takes the place of action.

To date, in Italy, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway .. I have successively conferred with the Prime Ministers, Ministere of Foreign Affairs, of Defense, of the Interior, of Education. I have also sometimes mat with the Chiefs of Staff, and specialiste of information and of psychological varfare.

To all of them, I have said:

I wish to gather all constructive ideas on this enttor. Your ideas will bo useful, perhaps, to other countries - even if you think them inapplicable in your own. Then, I shall make a synthesis of the reports so assombled adding thereto the thoughts of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs in this respect. And, at the (NATO) 'Conference of the 14 at the end of October, we shall have available a program on the basis of which constructive action can be taken."

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Whitney Sheperdson Phone Call to You of Yesterday,
15 September, Concerning Forced Labor

1. The central facts in this business are as follows:

a. NCFE had a letter sent to the President of the United States
signed by various individual exiles expressing their gratification
to the United States Government for its "initiative in placing as an
item for the agenda of the 8th session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations the matter of 'Evidence of Existence of Forced Labor'.

b. At this Division's direction the Department of State was
asked to prepare an answer to this letter for the President's signa-
ture which NCFE could publicly exploit in cooperation with the United
States Mission to the United Nations.

c. Late Friday afternoon this Division was informed by the De-
partment that no answer could be forthcoming as the U.N. Delegation
had decided not to push the forced labor matter at this time. NCFE
was informed to this effect the same afternoon and again on Monday by
this Division.

d. Because its letter was not being answered, NCFE erroneously
assumed that the work it was doing on forced labor in cooperation
with the U.N. Delegation was to be of no avail and in fact that it
was the decided policy of the United States Government not to force
this issue at this or any other time.

e. The net effect of this matter is as follows:

(1) The Department of State will draft an answer for the
President's signature which will be transmitted to Secretary of
State, Dulles for his personal approval after consultation with
Ambassador Lodge. The approved answer will then be transmitted
to President Eisenhower for his signature. Public exploitation

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT: British Foreign Office uneasiness concerning the tone and content of EFE broadcasting to the European satellites, and related matters.

1. Attached hereto is a memorandum of conversation prepared by Tracy Barnes, who sat in on a conversation which took place on 4 September in my office with Messrs. Rob Scott and Adam Watson of the British Embassy. Tracy's memorandum covers the conversation quite fully, but I should like to point out certain impressions and conclusions of my own which I believe to be worthy of your consideration.

2. It was quite evident that Rob Scott, who, as you know, is the new Minister, and Watson had received some fairly strong prodding from Sir William Strang, and it was equally apparent that they were not particularly well prepared as they were somewhat embarrassed when called upon for specifications- unable as they were to produce these. Three other features of the conversation which struck me rather forcibly were the following:

a. The fact that they placed primary emphasis on the absolute necessity at the present time of keeping the US-UK copybook completely stainless until such time as there shall (may?) have been a high-level four-power meeting, including the Soviets, and until such time as it shall have appeared clearly that the Soviet Government is not prepared to make concessions and otherwise adopt a conciliatory approach. This is a fairly evident British line which they have been peddling for some time and I do not doubt that you heard something of it while in London. If followed to the letter and permitted to order our conduct, the result would be that we would, adopt a total "sweetness and light" program for an indefinite period of time.

b. The fact that the Embassy representatives said that they had no intention of speaking with the State Department about any of this aroused some slight suspicion on my part that they may have been deliberately bypassing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

the Department in the hope of retting a better deal directly witi. us. This is the more my impression, since if the Fritish "sweetness and light" line is to be adopted and carried out in both letter and spirit then the State Department ind icter ho get into Mre as well. Obviously the utterances of top State Depertment officials, both here and abroad, and State Dena Lment actions are much were important Tor the pia-poste of tills particular British approach than are the actions and utterances of sur uneficial pray and black media. I reported the substance of the conversation to General Cabell who authorized me to bring it to the attention of Doc Matthews, which I have done, and at the same time requested him to advise us if the Dopart- ment hears anything about Lids from the British Embassy[^7]

C. Finally, Adam Watson dragged in by the tail some questions about the so-called "Freedom Corps", and asked me whether I could confirm that there had been a substantial "heating up" of tits old proposal within the past month or six weeks. I replied that if this iden --Mich was a very old one indeed in US Covernment cireles -- cad reached any particuler climax within the past month, 1 was not aware of it. I said that I and heard that the State Duratment was considering asking the Foreign Office what if thought about such a pr
then replied that the State Department had, in fact, submitted this question to the Foreign Office and that the Foreign Office had replied Chat it recommended most strongly against any broaching of this subject at least until after the derman elections. I thanked No. Watson for bringing me up to date, and the point tas not farthor pursued.

SUBJECT: RFE Coverage of ICFTU

The following extracts of RFE's Daily Ouidance Bulletins indicate the general guidance around which more complete coverages are prepared for broadcasting:

Daily Quidance 554, June 30, 1953, Page 2 Paragraph da

Concerning forthcoming conference of ICFTU, attention is called to Christian Science Monitor of June 24, reprinted in today's Information Dulletin, and to Report on America #13. "American Labor's Wide Hori- sons as published on June 26.

Daily Quidance 560, July 9, 1953, Page 4, Last two lines:

Remarks by George Meany, president of American Federation of Labor, be- fore Stockholm meeting at International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, in addition to expressing the philosophy of free workers toward less developed areas, should have a special significance to our listeners. at this stage of their struggle against Soviet colonialism. Meany de olared that freedom to colonial peoples and inhabitants of protectorates was something democracies must take steps to insure as soon as possible. The Federation (ICFTU) should see to it that workers in such territories enjoyed trade-union organization liberty.

Daily Quidance 573, July 28, 1953, Page 3, Paragraph c

As far as East Germany is concerned, most simificant news is vote by International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to set up a fund #to support insurgent unions in East Germany and other satellite countries in their efforts to undermine communist control". George Meany, Presi- dant of AF of L, predicted that substantial sums would be made available but "declined for obvious reasons" to say how they would be spent.

Meany's announcement would seem to be an event of major significance in which all target areas should be equally interested.

Latest reports on East German purge roosive most of their meaning from fact that a faction presently losing out is said to be composed of com munists who -- while not at all disloyal to the Kremlin are not Muscovites in the sense in which the victors are Muscovites. Chances are that all communist functionaries who did not spend the last war inside Russia are in danger of their jobs or, as the case may be, of their lives.

Human interest stories on recipients of food aid speak for themselves. However, emphasis might well be on fact that recipients are either pri- marily or exclusively unemployed workers and that communists dany the existence of unemployment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Food Program for Eastern Europe

1. This proposed program supports a plan for limited food distribution to the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.

It is generally agreed that it is highly desirable honesty to attempt food distribution through regular open channels, before utilizing any unusual method such as balloons, even though it is highly dubious the offers to distribute food will be accepted. It is further felt that no food program of any kind should be commenced unless it is certain to culminate in actual deliveries.

2. Formal Offer: A group such as a Committee to Assist the Peoples of Eastern Europe would be formed, which would in turn make an offer of a definite amount of food to representatives of the satellite governments of Eastern Europe. Simultaneously, the Department of State would be requested to take up the food offer officially with representatives of the governments concerned. CIA will arrange for the composition and sponsorship of the proposed committee. The food offer of the committee, taking note of the official statements indicating that a food shortage exists in each of those countries, would propose the establishment of an international commission to supervise the distribution of food to the needy children of the areas involved. This food would come from U.S. surplus stocks and through contributions made by the sponsoring organizations.

3. Delivery of Balloons: In event of refusal by the satellite regimes of the food offer, the committee might turn to the American Heritage Foundation for help. The latter would be asked to utilise its primary project, the Crusade for Freedom, both in raising public funds and delivering food by balloons.

Crusade for Freedom (MCFE)

A. Capabilities:

1. The Crusade can deliver 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 lbs. of food by way of 200,000 to 400,000 balloons into Czechoslovakia.

SECRET

IHungary and Poland over a period of two to three wecks;

2. The Crusade can deliver 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 lbs. of food in 400,000 to 600,000 balloons into Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland over a period of five to six wecks:

Capabilities (1) and (2) above, are possible within the time periode indicated only if U.S. military facilities and equipment for the necessary procurement and stand-by storage of the hydrogen gas for the balloons is available. (20,000,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas will fill 200,000 balloons sufficient to lift 1,000,000 lbs.) If such storage facilities, etc. are not available, the time periods must be revised for (1) and (2) above to two months and three months respectively;

3. First balloon launching could commence within sixty days of project authorization;

4. Each food package, suspended to one balloon, would contain five lbs. of staples. (sugar, fat, flour, coffee, chocolate) Packages will be sealed and/or wrapped with poly- ephelene.

B. Costs:

1. Costs of operation into Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland would be approximately $1.15 per net pound of food delivered, or a total figure of $1,166,000.00 for each 1,000,000 lbs. delivered.

2. Costs of operation into Albania, Bulgaria, Rumania and Baltic areas would be greater, due to added technical factors, necessity of shipboard launchings, etc. The unit cost figure would be $1.55 per net pound delivered.

C. Operational Considerations:

1. If delivery of food into satellite areas is considered feasibly, realistically sound, then entire operational effort must be centered at launching -- delivery of food in the shortest period of time. Counteraction to the impact of food deliveries will be immediate and sustained to include "tampering" with food packages, wholesale arrest, BW charges bolstered by staged photography.

2. Launching sites previously used by the Crusade for Freedom for balloon operations into Czechoslovakia were located along the Czech frontier between Cham and Hof. For launchings into Poland and Hungary, sites in Berlin and in and around Graz, Austria, respectively, would be the most operationally satisfactory.

Concurrence of the proper Austrian, West German and British
reprezentatives as to use of lawiching sites in their juris-
diction areas must be secured will in advance through the
appropriate channels.

3. There is no marantee that the Adenauer Coverment
   will be favorably disposed towards this food delivery program,
   even if it wins the September 6 elections.

4. For an oporation which envisions the lessening of
   200,000 balloons (1,000,000 lbs. of food) over as cort a period
   as two to three weeks, a relatively large group of icdigenous
   personnel must be hired, treined (four or five days) and super
   Vised over a minimum five week period.

D. Psychological Considerations

1. Most recent estimates indicates that the harvest
   10 Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland will be fair to average
   18 year. Consequently, it would be a mistake to send food
   12to these areas simply to alleviate a desperate enortave"
   wich might not in fact exist for workers in good standing.
   Father, as a part of EFE's accompanying program exploitation,
   the population would be urged to conserve the packages as "iron
   retions" or "atrike ratione" against the day when they might not
   otherwise be able to afford ausentecian or loss of veges for
   other reasons.

2. One of the graveet riska to any food delivery
   program of this kind, especially should its launching interval
   be in accase of two weeks, is the systematic poisoning of food
   parcele by the communists. The only really effective wey of
   safe awarding against this is by anticipating it and pre-con-
   ftioning the people, via Re, against contaminated efforts.

3. During the time when, and at the places where the
   food is packaged, the Crusade should arrange for supervision of
   Buch packaging by acceptable humanitarian/religious international
   oupe, such as the Quakers or the Red Cross, in order to neutralise
   charges and aument the Lonafides of the committees and Crusade
   for Freedom.

4. The initial private and official offers of food to
   the satellite areas must be accompanied with certain conditions
   ensuring guarantees of delivery, in order to avoid contunist
   acceptance of a dare food offer as such, which would place us
   in the awkward position of having to subsequently request.
   guarantees for proper distribution and delivery.

5. Type of *WE* "running attack" during balloon operation is well illustrated by the following -- 'Czech workers would have to work 6.6 hours to earn enough money to buy one average pound of food parcels contents, whereas the American worker could earn the $1.15 per net lb. delivered in 1.2 hours.'

D. Conclusions:

1.  The operation is large and the resultant psychological gains and losses, depending on many variables, could be extensive. Needless to say, the operation should not be undertaken, even in part, as a 'gesture' or on a 'gamble'.

2.  Balloons are not the most economical means of delivering food, in point of fact, the movement of items by balloon is at least twice as expensive as any regular means. However, to date, balloons are by far the most feasible way of diffusing a relatively large amount of food containers into an otherwise denied area.

3.  Planning of the operation in all its phases should include the Director of WP7, in order to ensure a well coordinated political warfare program.

E. Recommendations:

It is requested that should authority be given to proceed on this balloon-borne food program, such authorization be contingent on the following recommendations:

1.  That the commencement of the balloon launching be generally planned for the end of this year..

2.  That no more than 400,000 balloons be released (2,000,000 lbs. of food) at a cost of approximately $2,332,000.

3.  That the balloon launching phase of the food delivery operation into Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, not exceed ten full consecutive days from its date of commencement.

4.  That $50,000 be made available immediately for preparatory work.

5.  That food deliveries into Albania, Bulgaria, Rumania and the Baltics not be considered until after the primary operation into Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland has proved successful.

Spencer feels the need for some higher level political guidance than RFE is getting from their staff people and talked about getting together a board of people like George Kennan, etc. I told Spencer that I thought it unlikely that George would give very much time to this but might be willing to give them an occasional idea or suggestion.

(2) Spencer asked me about the possibility of their finding some job for Sam Reber. I told him to wait on this until I had time to discuss it with FW.

(3) Spencer seemed disturbed that the allocation of one million a month until our budget was passed would cramp their operations. I told him that if they had particular difficulties to let me know. He also asked what they should do about the proposed allocation of $400,000 to help in the refugee situation. I told him I was not familiar with this particular issue.

(4) He suggested that it would be well to have a meeting here with some of the members of the Board and the Executive Committee and suggested a date around the first week in August. I told him I would do it if I had not already left the country by that time.

SUBJECT: Coordination of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberation

1. As both you and Mr. Slogich agreed in your informal conver- sation of yesterday, the present explosive situation in the satellite periphery and the luteris Psychological Strategy Board gutüance on its exploitation necessitate closer cooperation between our respective facilities and branches. I want to thank you for offering to zake it possible for us to gain further access to BCFB libraries and open sources and for your offering us further technical assis- tance. I agree that it would be desirable to exchange a branch of- ficer so that we may have a better understanding of our respective assete and problems. SR/1 will provide one of your associates with a desk and complete access to our files at any time.

2. It may be well for us to discuss how ve can best take ad- vantage of further demonstrations and riots in the satellito areas. Should there be an uprising in Poland, for example, it may be desir- able for RFE to place broadcasting time at the disposal of Radio Liberation so that the latter may address concentrated and repeated appeals to the Red Army not to fire on Polish vorkers and peasants, not to interfere in the folish struggle for freedom, and to consider the Polish people as the allies of the Soviet people in their common struggle against Communise. It was thic lice that Radio Liberation followed during the East Geraan uprisings. In the event of lots in Czechoslovakia where the Red Army is cot present in force and where the satellite security forces may be unable to keep order, close cooperation will be even core desiratle.

3. Corsideration could be given to having RFE allot Radio Liberation regular time ca its broadcasts to Poland and bulgaria where there are large concentrations of Soviet troops so that. Radio Liberation can further build up the idea of a free, soviet anti- Communist moral and political authority and to express the solidar- ity of the Soviet peoples with the oppressed countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Ratio Liberation could also allot regular tim on its transmitters so that spokesmen of free Czechoslovakia and Poland could address the Soviet troops.

4. It will, of course, de necessary to discuss the divergent approaches of the two stations. Because of its ajornsorship, its identity and its mission, Sallo Liberation cannot treat the Sovis oppression of the Central and East European peoples in terms of nationalist domination and exploitation. Radio Liberation alvays distinguishes between the people on the one hand and the Farty and Police on the other, and it is our policy to identify the Red Army with the people. Se

ATTENTION: Branch One

SUBJECT: General Pavle Graya Pavlovic (201 - 14578)

REFERENCE: Memorandum from Deputy for Policy Coordination, SS to IO, dated 16 July 1952, Subject as above

1. Although not initially responsible for recommending that the NCFW subsidize General Pavle Pavlovic, in referenced memorandum SE Division endorsed the continuation of payments by the NCFA to Subject on the basis of his ability to aid in research work being done for CIA at the Pentagon, as well as of his need as a meritorious exile. We have recently been advised by Miss Stern of your office that the NCFW wishes to discontinue this payment since Subject does not participate directly in the NCFW's activities. We have been further advised that if SE Division wishes General Pavlovic to receive a regular income from the NCFW, SE must provide the necessary funds.

2. It is believed that termination of the subsidy by the NCFW will result in real personal hardship to the General, who, at the age of seventy, has no other known source of income. SE Division, however, is not in a position to provide the necessary funds, since this would necessitate the initiation of what would essentially be a charity project, falling more properly within the purview of IO/Branch One. Neither can this Division justify continuation of payments on the basis of work performed for SE, since he has been working primarily for the Department of the Army during the past year. The arrangements for his work at the Pentagon are such, however, that CIA can place research requirements on General Pavlovic whenever desirable.

3. In reviewing the case this year, we have ascertained from the Department of the Army that Subject has worked diligently and contributed materially to the work of his office. He has been particularly commended for his adaptability and readiness to work, which have shown themselves in his efforts to learn English and typing.

General Pavlovic's actual contribution to the efforts of the U.S. Government, if not of CIA or the HUFE directly, should be taken into consideration in addition to his very real need before halting payments to him.

"Report this morning Mrs. Hilde Benjamin new East German Justice Minister rescinded right to strike granted June 11 by predecessor.

Seems appropriate your boss Thursday press conference or perhaps more formally sum up recent Russian inspired communist actions behind curtain; in Czechoslovakia savings wiped out, future bleak, families, children bankrupt. In east Germany recision of elementary right of labor to strike is again denied and will be ruthlessly crushed by force. Satellite states long deprived of their food and goods by most vicious practices of colonialism known for two centuries. This is no paradise for workers, this is hell. In the United States this capitalist society so often denounced by Soviet propaganda lines, the savings of the workers are protected in law and in fact, and the right to strike is protected in law and in fact also. After almost two hundred years of its national existence there can not be found in the US one trace of the colonial practices which characterize Soviet rule over its satellite colonies.

Condon asks that if such theme is used "give our boys a break so they can prepare and push home with background and variation."

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Meeting with PBB

1. I understand that two of the matters that have come up before your PSB luncheon are:

a. C. D. Jackson's proposal to send food to East Germany via balloon.

b. C. D. Jackson's proposal for a monument memorial to be put up near the Brandenburg Gate. I would like to comment on these two proposals for what use it may be to you.

2. It seems to me food shipment via balloon is a meaningless gesture. It will not do any positive good because it can't get enough food into East Germany to make any difference. Thus a negative result is fostered; it looks and appears to be psychological warfare of a rather obvious kind. The food offers by the U. S. Government and those by the ICFTU were, as the London Times pointed out last Monday, psychological victories, but the Russians are now moving food into Germany in far greater quantities than we can do via balloon. In addition, there are obvious dangers from the standpoint of a BW play-back as Mr. Wisner suggested. It would be much easier and much more effective for the Russians to use the BW these on balloon shipments than on any quantities of food that the Government or the ICFTU are actually able to get behind the Iron Curtain. In sum, balloons are a trick and food doesn't lend itself to tricks.

3. I think the monument idea is a respectable one but not on the level that the PSB people seem to want to play it. They have in mind a world campaign to be conducted in all countries, particularly in this one and in South America with a distinguished body of citizens to lead the campaign here. I do not think the memorial idea is big enough for that (the best memorial so far erected was Berlin's own decision to change the name of the Unterlinden to Strasse June 17). I think the memorial idea ought to be left to the Germans. We can delicately suggest it and see that it is followed up with any support necessary in this country through already existing organizations such as NCFE or the Crusade for Freedom if this is necessary.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

July 21, 1953

" PROSPERO "

Proliminary Report

The purpose of this operation was to exploit the present critical circumstances in the Communist empire and in Czechoslovakia in particular by bringing to the people of that country tangible evidence of the Wost's interest in and support for their resistance against the regima. There follows a brief summary of the sallent facts about the operation:

1.  5402 rubber balloons and 1212 plastio balloonH were launched from the primary sito in Ellonfeld, a small Corman village on the Czechoslovak frontier and from the secondary sito in Sohonnee, some 40 miles to the south.

2.  These carried a not total (after wastage) of approximately 10,000,000 messages of three types:

a. A likeness of the now l-crown noto issued by the Czochoslovak regimo following tho recent currency reform. The toxt of this note is attached as Appendix A,

b. A replica of the new 25 holler coin, bearing the words "All our people for freedom All the free world for our peoplo". The words "Free Europe" and the emblem of the Freedom Foll appeared in the center of the coin.

c. A leaflet bearing photographs of the Eus Berlin demonstrations on one aide and a text describing recent events in East Germany and the Soviet Union (including the Beria purge) on the other. Copies of this message are attached as Appendix B.

3.  The target areas for the operation were: (a) the industrial and mining districts of northwest Bohemia; (b) the capitol of Prague and the heavily populated area north of Prague; (c) the city and environs of Pilsen; (d) the Ostrava rogion. (See display map.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 224

4. The oporation took place between 0800 Monday, July 13, 1953 and 2400, Friday, July 17. Balloons were in the air 15 working days after concoption of the idea, and 3 working days after final approval.. The third (Boriin-Feria) message was sent to the printer on Saturday; on Monday 2,000,000 copies were at the site and on the way to their destination.

5. A crow of 22 workmen was transported from Munich to the alto. Including guards, drivers, and supervisory personnel, the total payroll for the oporation was approximately 40. The crew was billeted in a small hotel in the nearby village of Tiraohenreuth and was fed in a Gasthof at the aite, Working time totalled approximatoly 3000 man hours. The operation entailed the use of 7058 cubic meters of hydrogen, representing 17900 lbs. of lift. The weight of the hydrogen cylinders was 102 tons.

6. The rubber balloons carried an average payload of 2 lbs. and burst at an altitude of from 30,000 to 40,000 ft. They rose in the air at a rate of 100 to 500 ft. por minute. The total elapsed timo from the leaflets' point of departure to arrival on the ground ranged from 2 to 5 hours. The plastio balloons carried a payload of from 1/10th to 4/10ths of a pound, travelled at an altitudo of 30,000 ft., and penetrated from 60 to 300 miles, depending on the target desired. The plastic balloons do not burst but descend to the ground at a point determined by the amount of gas and weight of payload. At the peak of tho operation well over one millior messages were in the air at the same time.

7. The wind speed averaged 40 miles per hour and ranged from 230° (blowing into Northern Schemla) to 270° (blowing towards Prague and Ostrava). Pilson was bracketed from both launching sites. Meteorological data was obtained from the Neubiborg air base and confirmed by radar facilities located 7 kilometers from the sito. These facilities and the personnel necessary to man them were obtained from the U. S. Army. They were able to track target balloons deep into the country. The radar units were also able to datect Czechoslovak air activity and to establish that the other side was also using radar, presumably. in connection with the balloons

8. Border activity was intensified during the period of operations. During 5 trips to the frontier (which was within sight of the launching location), it was observed that officers had replaced enlisted men on border patrols. On several occasions attempts were made by ground forces to shoot down


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 225

3. 
the balloons, although only two hits were observed by bordor police.

On Wednesday, July 15, at 1400 hours, two Migs flow along the frontier over the site and were clearly observed by the working party. Subsequently that afternoon the theodolite was moved to a hilltop point (from which, incidentally, the hills around Pilsen could be discerned) and Miga attempting to shoot down ballcons were viewed by members of the party as well as by the German border patrol. As many as 7 Migs were observed at one time. Three hits were witnessed, two of which appeared to cause the balloons to explode and one of which simply caused the balloon to disappear. On Wednesday night additional planes were reported by border police. Searchlights were also seen. On Thursday, 5 Nesseramiths 109Fs replaced the Migs and succeeded in destroying three balloons. No air action was observed on Friday, although at 1000 hours a jet vapor trail materialized directly above the Launching site and was headed into Czechoslovakia. lHowever, it was impossible to see the aircraft or to say for certain that this was a border violation.

9. On the last night of operations (Thursday) a procession of 80 plastic balloons with candle-lanterns was launched. Since the night was perfectly clear, the "torchlight parade" could be easily observed - the lights looked like stars marching quietly acress the sky. No aircraft wore seen.

10. The total cost of both the original operation and the supplementary Serlin-Beria message is estimated at loss than $25,000, or a unit cost of 1/5th of a cent per message sont. A substantial portion of this represents transportation and other non-recurrent expenses which would not be involved in a sustained operation.

11. Note must be made of the invaluable technical and operational assistance provided by the two General Mills personnel, Mr. C. B. Moore and Mr. Fletcher Bartholomew, who were present on the trip. It should also be mentioned that the help of RFE personnel was exceedingly valuable.

12. As of the date of this report, regime reaction includes:

A。
Rude Pravo editorial read over Radio Prague on July 18. (Appendix C), plus supplementary articles in Svobodno Slovo and Kada Front.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 226

4. 
b. Commentarios ovor Radio Mosecu in Russian and Polish and over Radio Warsaw.

c. Articles in the Romanian and Hungarian press.

d. An article in Moscow Pravda.

13. In accordanos with previous plans, Weatorn publicity about the operation was discouraged.

Conclusions

The limited purpose of "Prospero" has, so far as we know, been substantially achieved. However, it must be acknowledged that an operation of this kind is both *strongly provocative* and (because of its tangible form) susceptible to dangers not risked by radio. There is the further complication that it is launched from German soil and could conceivably cause injury to RFE's position in Germany. All of these fastors must be carefully weighed in considering any future action of this sort. Further, this must be classified as a "crash action", as evidenced by the time elapsed between conception and termination. Crash actions are good once or twice, but are not to be recommended as a habit either from the point of view of cost or, even more important, in cognizance of the utter necessity of careful and thorough preparation of the best possible message.

On the positive side, this can be stated:

1. The message was timely, worth saying, and closely integrated with RFE policy.

2. Enemy reaction was immediate and sorely hurt.

3. Intornal conditions and the world Communist situation suggest that the action was taken at an apt moment.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 227

4. Technically, with radar help it was provod
   that balloons could be launched carrying
   relativoly heavy payloads on on assembly lino
   basis with a high degree of target accuracy.
   This was not proviously known.

5. Aside from the irpact of the meesagos, the
   very fact that the West was interosted enough
   to go to the trouble and expense of ponotrating
   the Iron Curtain by a means which the regime is
   poworless to prevent by Miga or bullets
   cannot be lost upon the captive pooples.

How many victims will fall in the Soviet Union and how many

Only those will survive who detach themselves from the sinking

appease the wrath of the people, try to bribe their subjects
by promising concessions - as in Hungary and in Eastern
Germany - they will get nowhere: for the people will no

The people are growing stronger. The first flames of revolt
have flared out in Crechoslovakia and in Eastern Germany.
From Plisen, from Moravske Ostrava, from Oslavany, from Berlin,
Dresden and Magdeburg the echo of this revolt has roared
throughout the world and deeply shaken the entire Soviet realm:
the people showed their strength.

The Communist regimes recognized the menace and became afraid.
They started apologising. They started self-criticising.
They started giving promises. In Germany the anti-labor de-
crees had to be revoked. In Czechoslovakia the frightened
government was forced to desist from applying the penal laws
concerning absenteeism. In Moscow, under the influence of
the news of the peoples volt in Czechoslovakia and Germany,
the internal struggle became sharper. Beria and his all-
powerful police fell as victims. Your resistance has helped

# A BEACH AND PUBLICATION SERVICE

July 20, 1955

The following report is one of the first full attacks on the recent "Typhoon Operation" in Czechoslovakia. The test was read over Radio Prague on July 13, 1955:

We are going to read to you now an article from today's Rude Pravo. The article is called: "An Action Doomed to Failure". This is the peace policy of the Soviet Union and of all the countries of the camp of peace, the conviction that a war can be prevented grows stronger among the people all through the world. Naturally, this evolution creates a great concern with those for whom automation is to produce a source of immeasurable gains and of a luxurious life. Therefore the warmongers do their best to put obstacles in the way which leads towards the lessening of international tension. In focus is the part of the provocateur and saboteur of the peace effort given to Syngman Rhee. In Germany resolute were used, recruited from the ranks of Nazi war criminals in the democratic sector of Berlin as well as in some other parts of the German Democratic Republic. And after the failure this much heralded day, there comes the hypocritical and demagogical offer to help to the population of the DDR, which was made for obvious propaganda reasons which, in fact, was admitted by the Western bourgeois press.

Into this chain of provocations which are aimed against the strengthening of peace there also belongs the American propaganda action which was started in the last days in Western Germany against Czechoslovakia. In a similar way in which two years ago the all-famed "Crusaders for Freedom" were doing it today again with balloons: dispersing inflammatory leaflets over our territory are being sent from the Bavarian side.

The Munich transmitter Free Europe, financed by Ford and similar "Institutions" speaks bombastically of the propaganda balloon action which, allegedly is the biggest action of this kind which ever has been attempted and for the direction of which there came to Western Germany specialists from America.

We can indeed certify that the balloons specialists did not spare the leaflets in the first two days tens and hundreds of thousands of those leaflets are with our police and our national committees: where they are being brought by our citizens after having been discovered. The farmer Hajek from Domousnice, district of Ceeky Brod, brought an entire parcel of leaflets which came down in one place. Josef Korinek from Zatae brought an entire balloon which fell down. The leaflets are being brought by the works of the Vladimir Lenin Works as well as other factories, by farmers, railwaymen and children. Yet even if the balloon action was not only four times bigger - as Free Europe says - but hundreds times bigger than the Crusade action of 1951, it will bring to its initiators the very opposite of what they had in mind.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 234

With words of justified anger cur citizens core with the leaflets and they are especially offended by the fact that one of the leaflets is some kind of a facsimile of the new Czechoslovak crown stamped on both sides by inflamatory words. Our citizens held in esteem the new crown which is firm and valuable and has a great purchasing power which helped us to get rid of rationing and, therefore, with sharp and ofter crude words they criticize that its image had been misuned as the besis for printing big lien concerning the government of our republic and the USSR.

The second leaflet is propagating the Fascist provocations which took place on seventeen June ir the German Democratic Republic. When those provocations ended by failure, their organizers ordered that they should be used at last for the printing of leaflets with pictures, demonstrating the bandits of Berlin in action; as they are starting fires or indulging in provocations, etc.

Those pictures belong into the series of the photographs which the Nazis Throatcutters used to take while they were starting fires in the occupied countries, in the Ukraine, in Cracor, in Li Lidice. It is quite natural that this, too, can only create die- gust towards those who have started this criminal action. Besides, the pictures of the Fascist provocations in Berlin are no sense- tional neus for us, as the directors of the balloon action coviously imagine. Similar pictures were published not long ago in our Svet Prece, It demonstrates the absolute political shortsighted- ness which when people mentioned it is described as atupicity of the organizers of the balloor action who think that they could influence our people by leaflets one side of which constituteз a glorification of hatred and of the attack against peace thich was to take place on 17th June in Ferlin.

In vain is the part of the defender of Czechoslovak workire people and this will always be the sane assumed by those, from whose actions there emanates the wish to start a new murderous war which is not wanted by any honest working citizen whatever be is political or his religious opinion. This provocation clearly demonstrates how the USA reactionary circles plan the Lessening of international tension.

It is a gross heresy just at the time when the pecole of the entire world are looking forward with hope towards the possibili.ty of a truce in Korea, when with confidence they are folling the peace policy of USSR, aiming at the peaceful settlement of 11 disputed international questions.

Therefore, the balloon action was met with sharp condenration on the part of our people. The balloor specialists would certainly not like to hear what the people say when they bring the Beatlete to the SMB and to the Hatioral Committees. It is worth reticing. that ever. such people who to far did not find an active attitude to the socialist development express their surprise about the means the rest is employing. And all our people are deery offended by the latent violating of the independence ca our State territory. They are surprised by the great amount of stupidity of the people


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 235

who thought that they will achieve anything by the balloon. True, the Crusaders of Freedom in the West are losing more and more possibilities for conducting enemy activity on the territory of our Republic. On the frontiers of our country there stands a vigilant guard which breaks all the attempts of their agents and so they must be contented with the balloon action which our people overtly laughed at and which they condemn.

They openly say that the entire action was a kind of pansteriorm which not even Hitler dared to commis at the time of the greatest hatred campaign against Czechoslovakia. Then they are bringing the leafiete which they had found to the security organs and to the administrative organs, they ask that the action should be publicly condemned.

This spontaneous disgust concerning the balloon action demonstrated in which complete isolation lack of information and ignorance of the real thinking of our working people do live the mercenaries of Free Europe which is the patron of this act.on. Free Europe even broadcast, while propagating the balloons, some kind of poor poetry in which one says, that "Always all the good things were coming from above" and that our people knew this".

Yet our people have got a longer memory than Free Europe believes. They will remember what good came to them from above from the West; that it was the bombs which on the eve of the end of the war were murdering women and children in peaceful residential quarters of Prapte and Plzen and which destroyed the Plzen Skeda Works and the Prague Kolben Works in order to make our recorstrus-tion more difficult.. Later we were getting from above, from Western Germany a flood of the Colcvado beetle which was pobed to bring us misery and starvation, and they know very well what American pilots are bringing from above to the women and children of Korea.

And one more coincidence: One of the boxes with leaflets which was found near Brezce in the Plzen Region carried the Inscription Munchen and aise with the name of Munich are connected for every citizen the memories of the worst time of our nations: the memories how in reality looks the love of the so-called friends of our people.

In fact the organizers of the ridiculous and stupid balloon action spent their dollars or balloons, paper and metal samps carrying the emblem of Free Europe which are also being spread. They can hardly expect any thanks on the part of their employers because the result is exactly the contrary of the expected. True, a few business ren finally got their pockets full but otherwise the action was doomed to failure fremts very beginning. This action blown up by Frec Europe deflated soon just as Its balloons.

"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent the following note to the Embassy of the United States on July 20, 1953:

During the past days balloons were sent to Czechoslovakian territory with leaflets of a nature designed to incite discontent of the population and to encourage anti-state activities. This new attempt to influence the Czech working people with propaganda means of so primitive a level, understandably met with indignant instance, that the entire action was prepared and carried out by American citizens sent for this purpose to Germany, to German territory under U.S. occupation administration. It is, therefore, a new instance where the U.S. Government abused its position as an occupation power towards ends incomparable with the four power agreement on Germany, which binds the U.S. to carry out the occupation according to the basic tenet that Germany is never again to become a threat to world peace and its neighbors.

Another important factor which makes this new violation of basic principle of international law particularly objectionable is the fact that it took place at a time when the nations of the entire world are increasing their efforts to strengthen the peace and assure peaceful cooperation.

The aim of this provocative action, organized under the protection of U.S. occupation authorities is to increase the policies of the so-called cold war and to prevent a loosening of international tensions.

For these reasons the Government of Czechoslovakia decisively protests against this action and asks the Government of the U.S. to furnish information on the steps taken to prevent similar provocation aimed against peaceful co-existence of nations, representing crude interference in Internal Czech affairs."

Joser Korinck frch Zatec brought an entire balloon which feil dow The leaflets are being crought by the workers of the Vladimir Lenin Works as well as other factories, by farmers, railwaymen and children. Yet even if the balloon action wes not only four times bigger - as Free Europe says - but hundred times bigger then the Crusade accior. cf 1951, it will bring to its initiators the very opposite of what they had in mind.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 244

With words of justified anger cur citizens come with the leaflets and they are especially offended by the fact that one of the leaflets de some kind of a facrimile of the new Czechoslovak crown stamped on both sides by inflamatory woras. Gur citizens hold in esteem the new crown which is firm and valuable and has a great purchasing power which helped us to get rid of rationing and, therefore, with sharp and ofter crude words they criticize that 1ts image had been misused && the basis for printing; big lies concerning the government of our republic and the USSR.

The second icarlet is propagating the Fasciat provocations which took place on seventeen June ir the German Democratic Republic. When those provocations ended by failure, their organizers ordered that they should be aged at last for the printing of leaflets with picturea, demonstrating the bandits of Berlin in action; as they are starting fires or indulging in provocations, etc.

Those pictures belong into the series of the photographs which the Hazin Chroatcutters used to take while they were starting fires in the occupied countries, in the Ukraine, in Cradour, in Li Lidice. It is quite natural that this, too. can only create dis- guot towards those who have started this criminal action. Besides, the pictures of the Fascist provocations in Berlin are no Bепва- tional news for us, as the directors of the bailoor action cbviously imagine. Similar pictures were published not long ago in our Svet Frace, It demonstrates the absolute political shortsighted- ness which when people mentioned it is described as stupidity of the organizers of the balloor action who think that they could influence our people by leaflets one side o.. which constitute3 a glorification of hatred and of the attack against peace which was to take place on 17th June in Berlin.

In vain is the part of the defender of Czechosloval: working people and this will always be the same Assumed by those, from whose actions there emanates the wish to start a new murderous war which is not wanted by any honest working citizen whatever be his political or his religious opinion. This provocetion clearly demonstrates how the USA reactionary circles plan the lessering of international tension.

It is a gro63 heresy just at the time when the people of the entire world are looking forward with hope towards the possibility of a truce in Korea, when with confidence they are following the peace policy of USSR, aiming at the peaceful settlement of all disputed international questions.

Therefore, the ballcon action wan met with sharp condemnation on the part of cur people. The balloor specialists would certainly not like to hear what the people say when they bring the leafiets to the SNB and to the National Committees. It is worth noticing that ever such people who so far did not find an active attitude to the socialist development express their surprise about the means the West is employing. And all our people are deeply offended by the latent violating of the independence of our State territory. They are surprised by the great amount of stupidity of the poe

who thought that they will achieve anything by the balloons.
True, the Crusaders of Freedom in the West are losing more and more possibilities for conducting enemy activity on the territory of our Republic. On the frontiers of our country there stands a vigilant guard which breaks all the attempts of their agents and they must be contented with the balloon action which our people overtly laughed at and which they condemn.

They openly say that the entire action was a kind of provocation which not even Hitler dared to commit at the time of the greatest hatred campaign against Czechoslovakia. When they are bringing the leaflets which they had found to the security organs and to the administrative organs, they ask that the action should be publicly condemned.

This spontaneous disgust concerning the balloon action demonstrated in which complete isolation lack of information and ignorance of the real thinking of our working people do live, the mercenaries of Free Europe which is the patron of this action. Free Europe even broadcast, while propagating the balloons: some kind of poor poetry in which one says, that "Always all the good things were coming from above" and that our people knew this.

Yet our people have got a longer memory than Free Europe believes... They will remember what good came to them from above from the West; that it was the bombs which on the eve of the end of the war were murdering women and children in peaceful residential quarters of Prague and Plzen and which destroyed the Plzen Skoda Works and the Prague Kolben Works in order to make our reconstruction more difficult. Later we were getting from above, from Western Germany a flood of the Colorado beetle which was supposed to bring us misery and starvation, and they know very well American pilots are bringing from above to the women and children of Korea.

And one more coincidence: One of the boxes with leaflets which was found near France in the Plzen Region carried the inscription Munchen and also with the name of Munich are connected for every citizen the memories of the worst time of our nations: the memories how in reality looks the love of the so-called friends of our people.

In fact the organizers of the ridiculous and stupid balloon action spent their dollars for balloons, paper and metal shapes carrying the emblem of Free Europe which are also being spread. They can hardly expect any thanks on the part of their employers because the result is exactly the contrary of the expected. True, a few business men finally got their pockets full. But otherwise the action was decided to failure from its very beginning. This action blown up by Free Europe deflated soon: Just as its balloons.

Draft Note to Czechoslovak Government

*Verbatim Text*

Following is text note for transmission FOHORY in reply to its note July 20.

Begin text. The American Embassy presents its compliments to the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with reference to the Ministry's Note of July 20, 1953, concerning the release of balloons from the US Zone of Germany has the honor, upon instructions of the US Government, to make the following reply:

The balloons apparently in question were not released by any official agency of this Government but by the Crusade for Freedom, an organization established by private American citizens. The US Government has ascertained that the balloons were released for the purpose of communicating with the people of Czechoslovakia.

It is a fundamental conviction of the American Government and people that free communication between peoples constitutes a principle upon which the very life of the international community should be founded. If any government attempts to erect a wall sealing off its people from contact with the outside world, it is inevitable that ways will be found both by the people inside that country and by the peoples of other countries outside to penetrate that artificial barrier and maintain some line of contact with one another. The use by those outside of such media as balloons confirms that the Czechoslovak Government has created a barrier interfering with free communication. The US believes that the best assurance that this means of communication will not be used is to obviate the need for it by permitting what is natural and necessary in the modern world, namely, free contact between nations and the free exchange of information and ideas.

As for

As for the content of the messages carried to Czechoslovakia by this medium, it is understood that they contained information on current developments in Central and Eastern Europe and in addition various statements focusing on the idea of "freedom". There would be no reason for a government to be disturbed about the principle of freedom in a message to its people, if conditions of freedom actually existed in that country. One cannot readily believe that the Czechoslovak Government would even raise this issue with the US Government if the fundamental freedoms were observed in Czechoslovakia and if the Czechoslovak Government were not now especially concerned about the attitude of the people toward the absence of those freedoms.

The US Government cannot agree that the transmission of those messages to the people of Czechoslovakia from the territory of the US Zone of Germany by the Crusade for Freedom Committee involved any misuse of the position of the US as an occupying power. Such communication is clearly not contrary to any quadripartite agreements affecting Germany. Nor does such communication violate any other international agreement to which the US Government is a signatory.

With reference to efforts to strengthen world peace the US, as is generally known, has endeavored in every practicable way to work stop by step, in accordance with the deep interests of the American people in permanent peace and in cooperation with other countries, toward building an enduring structure of international peace and stability. The US seeks to help bring about a relaxation of international tension wherever there are genuine possibilities of doing so. It is recognized at the same time that true international tranquillity presupposes conditions which assure human rights and fundamental freedoms for the people concerned. End text/

# Sem't of Information

Follows Radio Prague announcement 0510 today re note on balloons:

"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent the following note to the Embassy of the United States on July 20, 1953:

During the past days balloons were sent to Czech territory with leaflets of a nature designed to insight discontent of the population and to encourage anti-state activities. This new attempt to influence the Czech working people with propaganda means of so primitive a level, understandably not with indignate instance, that the entire action was prepared and ceerted out by American citizens sent for this purpose to Germany, to German territory under US occupation administration. It is therefore a new instances more the US Government abuse in position as an occupation power towards ends incomparable with the four power agreement on Germany, which binds the US to carry out the occupation according to the basic tenet that Germany is never again to become a threat to world peace and ile neighbors.

Another important factor which makes this new violation of basic principle of international law particularly objectionable is the fact that it took place at a time then the nations of the entire world are increasing their efforts to strengthen the peace and assure peaceful cooperation.

The aim of this provocative action, organized under the protection of US occupation authorities is to increase the policies of the so-called cold war and to prevent a loosening of international tensions.

For these reasons the Government of Czech decisively protest against this action and ask the Government of the US to furnish information on the steps taken to prevent similar perversion aimed against peaceful co-existence of nations, representing crude interference in internal Czech affairs."

Proposed Balloon Campaign in Event President Offers Food to Poland

1. With reference to our discussion of 17 July, attached hereto is a sample of the coupon which it is recommended that the Crusade for Freedom distribute by balloon from Germany in the event that a Presidential offer of food for Poland is refused by the Polish Government. This coupon reads as follows:

The bearer of this coupon is entitled to receive from the food supplies donated by Americans!

(food listed will be those specifically offered)

Stamped across the coupon are the words, "Invalid due to the rejection of the offer by the Polish 'Peoples' Republic".

2. We are advising the Frankfurt mission of this plan and requesting their estimate of the number of leaflets which they could release by balloon from the Baltic. Please advise us whether or not your printing facilities can supply the German section with whatever number of leaflets they undertake to distribute. We, on the other hand, will advise you soonest of the number of balloons we will require from your stocks and the address to which they are to be consigned.

3. In the event that the Crusade desires to include a printed message on the reverse of the leaflet, it is requested that the text of the message be cleared either with this desk or with the German mission prior to printing.

MEMORANDUM FOR: IO/PP

ATTENTION: Mr. Thomas Braden

SUBJECT: Mr. Kenneth Dean Koch

1. In January of this year I discussed with your office the retention of Kenneth Dean. Koch in Berlin as RFE representative, due to his extensive usefulness to FI in Berlin, providing FI with cover facilities, leads, general services and working very satisfactorily in supporting the FI mission in Berlin. At that time I was assured by 10 that they would do everything possible to retain Itr. Koch in Berlin as the RFE representative. In May of this year I had occasion to visit Bob Lang in New York on another matter and I again touched upon Mr. Koch's assignment in Berlin, at which time Fr. Lang assured me that no changes would be made in Koch's assignment in Berlin without prior clearance with me. He also emphasized that no man would be sent to Berlin who did not meet with our complete approval. In the meantime, Koch was sent to Israel to set up the RFE office but seemingly met with opposition on the part of Israel authorities and has returned to Germany with no definite job envisaged for him. John Elliott has takon over the KFE office in Berlin and there seems to be no attempt to make any concessions to FI wishes in Berlin.

2. We find this solution an extremely unsatisfactory one. Elliott, by background, general character, and ability, is not as useful to FI in berlin as Koch was and I seriously doubt that RFE would find him as catisfactory as Koch in standard RFE business. I know Elliott when he was a newspaper man, and I have checked with several of his former colleagues who agree that he does not have any of the hard-hitting qualities sc desirable for an FFE representative in Berlin. This is not an attempt to bolittle his. ability as a journalist but the job in Berlin is very much more than that. In short, I would appreciate your office taking steps with RFE to return Dean Koch to Berlin as RFE representative, since his services to FI are very much desired even on a part-time basis. Our main reason for wanting Koch in Berlin is that the RFE office attracts a large percentage of Satellite refugees and as such it is important for us to have the head of the HFE office in Berlin

SOVIET ZONE POLITUURO MEETING

Cable dated 7/16/53 from Ahinich to New York

"East Oerman aling President Wilhelm Pieok is definitely on the way out, reliable sources in close contacts with the East German Govern-. ment said here today. The sources stated that Plock's ouster was dia closed during an East-West German Communist Politburo meeting which ended in East Germany on July 12. Top German Communist leaders were also told that East German Secret Police Chief, Wilholm Zaisser, is now suspended or under house arest. Zuisser was arrested for publica- tion of casilty figures of the June 17 revolt, the source said. His ouster also falls in line with recent Communist policy shifts all over the Red Empire, they said. At the meeting it was disclosed that SED head Walter Ulbricht will remain a potent force in East German politics despite recent rumoro of hio imponding purge. Premier Otto Grotswohl will be given increased power in the new government set-up, the sources said. During a discussion of recent events in the Soviet at the Polit- buro meeting, the Communist leaders were given information from Moscow reporting that Foreign Minister. Colotov will emerge during the cart month as the key figure in the Soviet Union. Premier Malenkov will serve as a figurehead for Holotov, the sources revealed. The Red Army is fast becoming a major political force in Russia and several generals have been recalled from outpost arens by order of Molotov, the sources said. The USSR is suffering from acute shortages of raw materials, especially rubber and oil, as well as strategic metals of the rarer varieties, it was disclosed at the meeting. In view of this, the top Communists were told that Russia would continue its "peace offensive" for at least another year. The sourves, reported to be "highly ro liable", said that the revelations released at the meeting were to be used as "policy directives" by East and West Communist leaders."

NOTE:

FYI. "This information was released through our Central News with the warning to treat with extreme caution, adding that Political ad visor's office agreed it is of most explosive nature and should be handled strictly as speculation."

PROVISIONAL GUIDANCE: PURGE OF BERIA

I BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS:

(THIS WILL BE ISSUED LATER IN MORE DETAIL AS SOON AS TIME PERMITS.)
THE FOLLOWING FACTS, HOWEVER, STAND OUT IMMEDIATELY:

1. NO PERSON OF BERIA'S RANK IN THE SOVIET UNION HAS FALLEN SINCE BERIA HIMSELF REPLACED YEZHOV IN 1938; THE FORCE COULD NOT BEING ATA HIGHER LEVEL. THE CHARGES AGAINST BERIA (OF BEING A BOURGEOIS RENEGADE IMPERIALIST AGENT WHO TRIED TO OVERTHROW THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT, DESTROY THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND RE-ESTABLISH CAPITALISM IN THE USSR) ARE OF A MAGNITUDE COMPARABLE ONLY TO THOSE AGAINST THE TROTSKYITES AND THE RIGHTISTS IN THE 1920'S.

2. THE STRUGGLE FOR THE SUCCESSION TO STALIN IS DEVELOPING MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN AFTER THE DEATH OF LENIN. IT TOOK FOUR YEARS FOR STALIN TO REMOVE THE RIGHTISTS. FURTHERMORE, CONSIDERING THE SHIFT TO THE RIGHT IN THE EAST GERMANY AND HUNGARY, AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT AS LATE AS A WEEK OR SO AGO OF "PRO-NATIONALIST" CHANGES IN TADJIKISTAN, THE DECISION IN THE STRUGGLE MUST HAVE HAPPENED ONLY WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS. BERIA'S ABSENCE (WHEN ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO WERE PRESENT) AT THE BOLSHOI THEATRE ON JUNE 28 WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC INDICATIONS OF HIS APPROACHING FALL; THE JULY 8 EDITORIAL OF IZVESTIA, THE SECOND.

3. THE FORCES WHICH DESTROYED BERIA ARE CERTAINLY A COLLECTIVE GROUP, NOT SIMPLY MALENKOV HIMSELF. MALENKOV'S NAME APPEARS ONLY ONCE IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE PRAVDA EDITORIAL EMPHASIZES COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP MORE THAN EVER BEFORE.

4. THE PRAVDA EDITORIAL MARKS A NEW REVERSAL IN THE GENERAL LINE--AWAY FROM RIGHTISM AND TOWARD LEFTIST EXTREMISM, OR PERHAPS MORE ACCURATELY AWAY FROM MODERATION AND TOWARD; -- FASCIST EXTREMISM. THE SHIFT TO AN EXTREMIST COURSE IS BASICALLY IN TWO QUESTIONS:

A. THE NATIONALITIES QUESTION
B. AGRICULTURAL COLLECTIVIZATION

IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT BERIA WAS PRO-NATIONAL MINORITY AND ANTI-INTENSIFICATION OF COLLECTIVIZATION. THE GROUP WHICH HAS REMOVED HIM IS PRO-GREAT RUSSIAN AND PRO-COLLECTIVIZATION. IT IS RETURNING TO THE STALINIST LINE. WILL THE DOCTORS' PLOT BE REVIVED? THE SLANSKY TRIAL? SLANSKY-TYPE TRIALS IN THE SATELLITES?

5. NOT ONLY BERIA HIMSELF HAS FALLEN BUT THE WHOLE APPARATUS OF THE SECRET POLICE IS DENOUNCED, WILL LOSE MUCH FACE AND IMPORTANCE AND WILL BE SUBJECTED TO A TREMENDOUS PURGE, WHICH MUST SHAKE THE WHOLE GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS.

SECURITY INFORMATION

8. THIS PEACE OFFENSIVE WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE BUT WILL HAVE NOW A PURELY PROPAGANDA CHARACTER; NO GENUINE CONCESSIONS (E.G., SURRENDERING OF EAST GERMANY) WILL NOR TAKE PLACE. ON THE INTERNAL SCENE IN THE SOVIET SPHERE THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE TALK OF IMPROVING THE LIVING STAN-DARDS OF THE WORKERS BUT IN ACTUALITY THE COURSE WILL BE TOWARD INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF CONSUMER GOODS-PARTICULARLY IN THE SATEL-LITES.

II. GUIDANCE:

CAUTION: AS BEFORE, WE SPECULATE ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE KREMLIN AND THE SATELLITE COUNTRIES BUT WE DO NOT ACCEPT ANY ONE PARTICULAR THEORY. THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST ACT OF THE POWER STRUGGLE FOR THE SUCCESSION, BUT ONLY THE FIRST ACT; THERE ARE MANY MORE AND BLOODIER ACTS TO COME. THE COALITION WHICH DESTROYED BERIA IS JUST SUBJECT TO INTERNAL DISSENSION AS WAS THE MALENKOV-BERIA-MOLOTOV COALITION FUSED AFTER THE DEATH OF STALIN. THE BASIC ANALOGY HERE IS TO STALIN'S TACTICS AFTER THE DEATH OF LENIN. FIRST HE ELIMINATED TROTSKY AND THE LEFTS (THE NEW COALITION NOW ELIMINATES BERIA); THEN HE ELIMINATED THE RIGHTISTS (PROBABLY THE NEXT ACT IN THIS PRESENT DRAMA WILL IN-VOLVE ELIMINATION OF THE REST OF THE COALITION BY THE RISING ELEMENT IN IT).

A. TO THE PEOPLE:

AS THE SATELLITES DEVOUR EACH OTHER EVER MORE FEROCIOUSLY, OUR PEOPLES CAN LOOK ON WITH PLEASURE AND LOATHING WHILE THEIR OPPRESSORS ARE MAKING THEMSELVES WEAKER AND THEY (THE EAST EUROPEAN PEOPLES) ARE BECOMING STRONGER. WHEN THE KREMLIN IS WEAKENED BY SUBVERSION THE SATELLITE KREMLINS ARE EVEN MORE WEAK AND PARALYZED. AND OF COURSE THE PURGE HAS JUST BEGUN. LOCAL SATELLITE COM-MUNIST BIG SHOTS WILL BE TOO OCCUPIED WITH SAVING THEIR OWN SKINS TO BE AS TYRANNICAL AS BEFORE. THIS COULD NOT COME AT A BETTER TIME FOR THE PEASANTS AND WORKERS OF EASTERN EUROPE: AFTER EASTERN GERMAN REVOLTS AND CZECHOSLOVAK DEMONSTRATIONS, THEY KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND THEIR OWN POWER. AS THEY ARE MARSHALLING THEIR FORCES, THEIR TYRANTS' STRUCTURE OF CONTROL IS CRACKING. THE EVENTUAL RUIN OF COMMUNISM HAS NEVER MORE CERTAIN THAN NOW. THE REGIMES WILL CERTAINLY TRY, AS THE KREMLIN IS TRYING, TO PRESENT A FACADE OF "MONOLITHIC UNITY." BUT YOU KNOW, AS THEY KNOW, THAT THE FACADE IS HOLLOW AND THAT THE REGIMES, CONFUSED AND RENT WITH INTERNAL DISSENSION, WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE ANY CLEAR AND DECISIVE POLICY. HOWEVER, WE SHOULD WARN THE PEOPLE THAT THIS SHIFT TO EXTREMISM MAY MEAN (IN HUNGARY IN PARTICULAR) THAT THE KREMLIN WILL ORDER ITS PUPPETS TO TAKE A MORE EXTREME COURSE THAN BEFORE (BUT HERE ALSO WE MUST WAIT AND SEE-CONFUSION NOW REIGNS EVERYWHERE). NOW IS THE TIME, IN THIS PERIOD OF CONFUSION, FOR THE PEOPLE TO SECURE THE GAINS THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE AND PRESS ON FOR MORE. IN A VERY REAL SENSE, THE PEOPLE RE MORE THAN MERE ACTORS ON THE STAGE RATHER THAN SPECTATORS IN THE AUDIENCE. LED BY YOUR OWN LEADERS, YOU THE PEOPLE MUST CONTINUE YOUR EFFORTS IN THE COL-LECTIVE FARMS AND IN THE TRADE UNIONS, IN THE WAYS YOU KNOW SO WELL, TO FORCE THE REGIMES TO MAKE ACTUAL CONCESSIONS TO YOU.

D. TO THE COMMUNEST5

THE KREMLIN IS RIGHT IN ONE POINT--THIS IS AN EVENT OF IMMENS: SIGNIFICANCE. IT PROVES ONCE NONE, AND MORE PRANATICALLY THAN AT ANY TILE SINCE THE THIRTIES, THAT NO COMMUNIST CAN EVER BC SAFE. THOSE OF YOUR LIKE ZAPOTOCKY WHO TRIED TO HEDGE IN HIS BRATISLAVA SPEECH ON THE NATIONALIST ISSUE; THOSE OF YOU LIKE NAGY, GERO AND BATA WHO BECAME THE SYMBOLS OF THE RICHTIST COURSE YOU ARE SUITABLE OFFENUINGS FOR THE NEW SLAUGHTER AND THOSE COMMUNIST LEADERS WHO HAVE NOT RECOVE PREMATURE RIGHTIST DEVIATIOISST KILI. NOW UNDOUCTEDLY TRY TO BECOME EXTREMISTS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE-NO MATTER HOS MANY OF THEIR COMRADES THEY EUST DRAG DOWN IN A NEW PURGE. AND WHAT IS THE POINT OF TRYING TO BECOME AN EXTREMIST AGAIN? YOU KNOW THAT THE NES SOVIET DICTATOR (REERABER WE CANNOT BE SURE WHO HE WILL BE, HAVING ELIMINATED BERIA, WILL NOT TRY TO ELLLONATE BERIA'S OPPONENTS. AS COMMUNISTS (SEE CEFCHOSLOVAK GUTDANCE NULGER DEN) YOU HAVE ONLY TWO CHOICES. YOU CAN AND THE PEOPLE AND SABOTAGE THE REGIME, THUS CROSSING THE "GOLDEN BRIDGE TO SAFETY, OR YOU CAN FLED. THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE.

C. TO THE SECRET POLICE:

TOUR TURN HAS NOW COME. IF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT BERIA PROMOTED AND ALL THIS LOCALNORGANG OF THE END IN THE USSR ARE TO BE PUNCED, AS IS NOW ANNOUNCED, WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HA PER TO YOUR FOOR LARTONETTES IN THE SATELLITES? YOU HAVE EVEN IESS CHANCE TO SURVIVE THAN THE ORGINARY COMMUNIST. AGAIN, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE PEOPLE OR YOU CAN FLEE. OTHERWISE, YOUR DOOM IS CERTAIN..

NOTE:

AS YOU WILL SEE FROM THE ABOVE, OUR PRESENT LINE (THE INCREASING STRENGTH OF THIS PEOPLE, THE INCREASING WEAKNESS OF THE REGIME) REPAIRS INTACT. CZECHOSLOVAK GUIDANCE NUMBER TEN & ALNOST COUPLETELY INTO THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AND MUST NOW BE IMPLEMENTED (WITH APPROPRIATE CHANGES FOR HUNGARY AND POLAND) WITH RENEWED VIGOR.

5. NOT ONLY BERIA HIMSELF HAS FALLEN BUT THE SHOLE APPARATUS OF THE SECRET POLICE IS DENOUNCED, WILL LOSE MUCH FACE AND INWORTANCE AND WILL BE, SUBJECTED TO A TREMENDOUS PURGE, WHICH MUST SHAKE THE WHOLE GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS.

6. THE PEACE OFFENSIVE WILJ. FROMBLY CONTINUE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE--
   BUT WILL HAVE NOW A FURELY PROPAGANDA CHARACTER; HO GOTTER CONCESSIONS (E. G.,
   SURRENDERING OF FAST GERMANY) WILL NOW TAKE PLACE. ON THE INTEGAL SCENE IN
   THE SWIET SPHERE THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE TALK OF LUPONING THE LIVING STAN
   DARDS OF THE WORKERS BUT IN ACTUALITY THE COURSE WILL BE TWARD INCREASED
   CAPITAL INVESTIENT AT THE EXPENSE OF CONSUMER GOODS-PARZICULARLY IN THE SATEL-
   LITES.

II. GUIDANCE:

CAUTION: AS DEFORE, WE SPECULATE ON FUTURE DEVELOPARTZE IN THE KREMLIN AND THE
SATELLITE COUNTRIES BUT WE DO NOT ACCEPT ANY CHE PARTICULAR THAY. THIS IS
THE END OF THE FIRST ACT OF THE FORER STRUGGIE FOR THE SUCCESSION, BUT ONLY THE
FIRST ACT, THERE ARE MANY HORE AND BLOODIER ACTS TO CONE. THE COALITION WHICH
DESTROYED BERIA IS JUST AS CUBJECT TO INTERNAL DISSENCE ON ES WAS THE MALENKOV-
BERNIA-MOLOTOV COALITION FORDED AFTER THE DEATH OF STALIN. THE BASIC ANALOGY
HERE IS TO STALIN'S TACTICS AFTER THE DEATH OF LENIN. FLEET HE ELIMINATED
TROTSKY AND THE LEFTISTS (THE NEW COALITION MOR ELIMINEMIA); THEN HE
ELIMINATED THE RIGHTISTS (PROBABLY THE NEXT ACT IN TES PESENT DRAMA WILL IN-
VOLVE ELIMINATION OF THE REST OF THE COALITION SY THE ZISING ELEMENT IN IT).

A. TO THE PEOPLE:
AS THE BOLSHEVIKS DEVOUR EACH OTHER ETER WORE PYHOCZUSLY, OUR PEOPLES CAN
LOOK ON WITH PLEASURE AND ASSURANCE WHILE 110IR OPPRESSES ARE MAKING THEMSELVES
WEAKER AND THEY (THE FASTERN EU OPEAN PEOPLES) ARE BECCING STRONGER. WHEN THE
KREMLEN IS WEAKSNED BY DISSENSION THE SATELLITE KREMLINE 122 EVEZI LIORE WEAK
AND PARALYZED. AND OF COURSE THE PURGE HAS JUST EECOM. ICEL SATELLITE COM
VUNIST HIG SHOTS WILL BE TOO OCCUPIED WITH SAVING THEIR DET SKINS TO BE AS
TYRANNICAL AS BEFORE. THIS COULD HOT COME AT A BETTER ZE FOR THE ITASANTS
AND WORKERS OF FASTERN EUROPE: APTER EASTERN GERMAN REVOLTS AND CZECHOSLOVAK
DEKONSTA TIONS, THEY NOW KNOW THEIR OMN STRENGTH AND THEIR DAN POWER. AS THEY
ARE WARSHALLING THEIR FORCES, THEIR TYRANTS STRUCTURE OF CONTROL IS CRACKING.
THE EVENTUAL DOOM OF COMMUNISH WAS HEVER MORE CERTAIN TELE DOW. THE REGIMES WILL
CERTALILY TRY, AS THE KREMLIN IS TRYING, TO PRESHMIT A FACADE OF "MONOLITHIC
UNITY." BUT YOU KNOW, AS THEY KNOW, THAT THE FACADE IS HOLLOW AND THAT THE
REGIMES, CONFUSED AND RENT WITH INTERNAL DISSENSION, WILL PEOBABLY NOT BE ABLE
TO UNDERTAKE ANY ONE CLEAR AND DECISIVE POLICE. HOWEVER, BE SHOULD WARN THE
PEOPLE THAT THIS SHIFT TO EXTREMISH WAY MEAN (IN HUNGARY IX PARTICULAR) THAT
THE KREMLIN WILL ORDER ITS PUPPETS TO TAKE A MORE EXTREME COURSE THAN BEFORE
(BUT HERE ALSO WE MUST WAIT AND SEE CONFUSION NON REIGNS EVERYWHERE). NOW IS
THE TIME, IN THIS PERIOD OF CONFUSION, FOR THE PEOPLE TELETFE THE GAINS THEY
HAVE ALREADY MADE AND PRESS ON FOR MORE. IN AVERY REAL SENSE, THE PEOPLE RE
MORE THAN EVERY ACTORS ON THE STAGE RATHER THAN SPECTATORS IN THE AUDIENCE.
LED BY YOUR NEW LEADERS, YOU THE PEOPLE, MUST CONTINUE YOUE 2770R.IS IN THE COL-
LECTIVE FARMS AND IN THE TRADE UNIONS, IN THE WAYS YOU KICH SO WELL, TO FORCE
THE REGIME TO MAKE ACTUAL CONCESSIONS TO YOU.

B. TO THE COMMUNISTS:

THE KREMLIN IS RIGHT IN ONE POINT--THIS IS AN EVENT OF IMMENSE: SIGNIFICANCE. IT PROVES ONCE MORE, AND MORE DRAMATICALLY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE THIRTIES, THAT NO COMMUNIST CAN EVER BE SAFE. THOSE OF YOUR LIKE ZAPOTOCKY WHO TRIED TO HEDGE IN HIS BRATISLAVA SPEECH ON THE NATIONALIST ISSUE, THOSE OF YOU LIKE NAGY, GERO AND BATA WHO BECAME THE SYMBOLS OF THE RIGHTIST COURSE—YOU ARE SUITABLE OFFERINGS FOR THE NEW SLAUGHTER. AND THOSE COMMUNIST LEADERS WHO HAVE NOT BECOME PREMATURE RIGHTIST DEVIATIONIST WILL NOW UNDOUBTEDLY TRY TO BECOME EXTREMISTS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE—NO MATTER HOW MANY OF THEIR COMRADES THEY MUST DRAG DOWN IN A NEW PURGE. AND WHAT IS THE POINT OF TRYING TO BECOME AN EXTREMIST AGAIN? YOU KNOW THAT THE NEW SOVIET DICTATOR (REMEMBER WE CANNOT BE SURE WHO HE WILL BE, HAVING ELIMINATED BERIA, WILL NOW TRY TO ELIMINATE BERIA'S OPPONENTS. AS -COMMUNISTS (SAYS CZECHOSLOVAK GUIDANCE NUMBER TEN) YOU HAVE ONLY TWO CHOICES. YOU CAN AID THE PEOPLE AND SABOTAGE THE REGIME, THUS CROSSING THE "GOLDEN BRIDGE" TO SAFETY, OR -- YOU CAN FLEE. THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE.

C. TO THE SECRET POLICE:

YOUR TURN HAS NOW COME. IF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT BERIA PROMOTED AND ALL THE LOCALNORGANS OF THE AVD IN THE USSR ARE TO BE PURGED, AS IS NOW ANNOUNCED, WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR POOR MARIONETTES IN THE SATELLITES? YOU HAVE EVER LESS CHANCES TO SURVIVE THAN THE ORDINARY COMMUNIST. AGAIN, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE PEOPLE OR YOU CAN FLEE. OTHERWISE, YOUR DOOM IS CERTAIN.

NOTE:

AS YOU WILL SEE FROM THE ABOVE, OUR PRESENT LINE (THE INCREASING STRENGTH OF THE PEOPLE, THE INCREASING WEAKNESS OF THE REGIME) REMAINS INTACT. CZECHOSLOVAK GUIDANCE NUMBER TEN IS ALMOST COMPLETELY INTO THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AND MUST NOW BE IMPLEMENTED (WITH APPROPRIATE CHANGES FOR HUNGARY AND POLAND) WITH RENEWED VIGOR.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, 10

FROM: EE/Czechoslovakia

SUBJECT: Bohumil HOUSER

1. Reference is made to a letter dated 25 June 1953 and addressed to you from Mr. Leo M. Chorne, Executive Director of the Research Institute of America, forwarding certain proposals sent to the latter by Mr. Bohumil HOUSER of the International Rescue Committee, Camp Valka, Nuernberg, Germany. This momorandum will summarize for you our knowledge of Subject, and our present interest in his activities.

2. Subject was born 1 March 1922 in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. He reportedly fought in the underground in World War II and was taken prisoner. From the end of the war until December 1945 he was employed as interpreter to the U.S. military unit in Falknov, Czechoslovakia, and in 1949 he was head of the porsonnel department of the Brown Coal Mining Company in Falknov.

3. According to a report from the British Army of the Rhine, he was recruited by the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service in 1946 in Cheb, Czechoslovakia, and is an ardent Communist. According to the CIC, he travelled to Belgium shortly after the war, and then returned to Germany (sic).

4. We do not know exactly when Subject left Czechoslovakia. Ho seems to have emigrated to Australia in 1949 or 1950, and to have returned to Germany some time prior to September 1951, when he became associated with the American Fund for Czech Refugees and with the International Rescue Committee. According to one informant, Subject was deported from Australia for Communist Party activities.

5. On 14 April 1953 Subject sent Mr. Cherne an operational proposal of such interest that, in spite of the unfavorable information on Subject, ve felt obliged to investigate it further. Upon our instructions, an agent of the Munich Operations Base contacted Subject on or about 25 June, using air force cover, and obtained the identity of Subject's lead. This person turned out to be an individual who has been suspected since 1949 of being an agent of the Czech Intelligence Service, and who has very recently been crossing lines with one or two operations being run by Berlin Operations Base. Under the circumstances it appears very likely that Subject's lead amounts to nothing more than a provocation or fabrication. We are still waiting for an appraisal and recommendations from the field.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

SUBJECT: Proposed Balloon Operation

1. The following message was received from Whitney Shepardson on the proposed balloon operation.

Shepardson talked at length with Conant yesterday, Monday. Conant did not object to the proposed balloon operation, but on the contrary "endorses" the project, but said he could not "request" acquiescence. Thus Shepardson says we have "improved upon our minimum expectations".

Shepardson says further that Adenauer has been away since last Saturday but that Lentz and Hallstein were to have returned last night and IICOO is trying to arrange an appointment with either or both for today, Tuesday.

Shepardson will send further word after these talks.

On 6 May Congressman Kersten addressed a letter to the State Department, enclosing a letter dated & May 1953, which he had received from Mr. Creighton Scott, a former employee of Radio Free Europe at Munich, Germany. This letter was highly critical of certain personnel in RFE, particularly as regards allegations of pro-communist attitudes. On 6 July I discussed these criticisms with Congressman Kersten in detail, conveying to him orally the material contained in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 from the Director of Security; Subject: Inquiry by Congressman Kersten; which the Director of Security had noted should be utilized in this meeting with Congressman Kersten.

2. The Congressman noted the difficulty in evaluating the type of criticisms which Mr. Scott had made but appeared willing to accept our explanation.

3. Congressman Kersten then turned to certain criticisins which he had heard expressed regarding RFE from several sources, including Scott. One such criticism is that RFE is no doing the best it should on religious programs. He feels that this aspect of the broadcasts could probably be considerably strengthened, particularly among Catholic elements.

4. Mr. Kersten cited the opinion of Count Tarnowski (sp. ?), a well known Pole, who told the Congressman that any fourteen year old Soviet citizen would be so well briefed on Soviet philosophy as to turn up their noses at the RFF material. The Count (and Kersten appears to agree) feels that the Soviet population has more sophisticated philosophicai material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it should be an important function of RFE to counter with an attempt to destroy the Soviet philosophical material and shake the Soviet faith in their theoreticians.

5. Congressman Kersten realized that it is difficult to capture a wide audience with philosophical arguinents, but he feels that if these arguments reached a segment of important leaders behind the Iron Curtain, it would help to destroy and counter the philosophical teachings of Marx, Lenin, et al. The Congresamen feels that many of our broadcasts deal with economic inatters, and, while these are important, RFE should go


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 275

deeper and hit harder on religion and philosophy.

6. While Congressman Kersten is aware that many of the captive population are not interested in rightest movements, it is his opinion that RFE cannot beat communism with socialism. In particular, he felt (and Scott bore this out in their conversation) that we were making too much use of Czech socialista, and we were using socialists from the Eence Government which had sought to compromise with the communists. While he recognizes the popularity of Benes and Masaryk in Czechia, he feels they are not el-fective in Slovakia, where there is a heavy Catholic population.

7. Congressman Kersten plans to go to Europe, probably in September. While he did not say so, I believe he would welcome an invitation to visit RFE, Munich. Furthermore, as the author of the Kersten Amendment and of several resolutions on the enslaved peoples, at least one of which may receive Congressional approval at this session, consideration might be given as to whether it would be advisable to request the Congressman to utilize RFE facilities to broadcast while he is abroad.

SUBJECT: D'Arcy Brophy and Louis Novins' Trip to Europe

1. Mr. Brophy and Mr. Novins tell me that you have agreed to pay their expenses for their trip to Europe. I told them that since they were traveling on our business they should draw the money from Heritage Foundation funds which have been made available.

2. I think this is the tidiest way of handling the transaction. Novins gave me some representations that it would be better to channel funds for the trip through one of his clients, Paramount Pictures. This seems to me complicated and insecure, and I recommend that if this subject is raised with you directly, you again suggest use of Heritage funds.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTES.LIOZACE

SUBJECT: Comments on Arthur Page's letter of 29 June 1953

1. I think a budget presentation before a mixed audience of PEC nevcera and directors or members of the Executive Committee of NCYE plus expposedly members of the MCF? staff would be extremely confusing, whether it were hold here or in New York. Not all the marbers of the PC have detailed knowlodge of NCHE operations and most of the merbers of the xocutive Committee do not have such knowledge. I see & reeting Duch as Arthur Page suggests going about as follows:

a. 10 Division presents the budget with cuts which we plan to recommend.

b. Members of the Executive Committee of NCFE oppose the cats.

c. PRC is placed in a position of turning down its own staff before the assembled outsiders with whom the staff is working.

2. I should suggest instead that we follow the following proce-durat:

a. 10 Division presents the budget with the suggested cuts in same.

b. PRC considers these cuta carefully.

c. PRC calls in export members of the staff of NCFE, 1.0. Spencer Phenix, Bob Lang, Bernie Yarrow etc., if it desires to do so, and questions them on any matter within their respective responsibilities and in particular about the suggested cuts.

d. The exports leave the room.

e. PRC rakes up its mind whether to accept the cut proposed or to make bigger cuts, or to add to the budget, as it may desire to do.

3. It would be useful to brief the Executive Committee on the reasons why any changes in the budget are made after they are made, and it might be well to have a luncheon with the Executive Committee down here or in New York after the action has been taken and have the Director explain the reasons why Prio did thig or thats for Agency action.

4. I suggest that you write Arthur Page saying that you think a meeting such as Phenix suggests would confuse our procedures but that you do think a later routine, with the Executive Committee to explain the actions taken and have a meeting of minds for the work ahead after the budget has been passed would be useful.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/PP

SUBJECT: Recent Developments in the Rumanian Refugee Situation

1. In a verbal report to the Rumanian National Committee upon his return from a trip to Europe to secure former King Michael's approval of a proposed refugee committee, Mr. Visolanu stated that the King did not reject the proposal advanced for the reorganization and enlargement of the present Committee, although he indicated no interest in having the plan put into effect immediately. This information on the attitude of the King is contrary to that previously reported by a member of the Rumanian National Committee, who stated that the King had finally rejected the proposal upon the recommendation of his ADC, Ietru-Lazar.

2. In his last conversation with Mr. Visolanu, the King requested that the members of the present Rumanian National Committee should send him, either jointly or individually, their opinions in writing about the following points:

a. On what grounds does the Rumanian National Committee consider that it cannot continue in its present form?

b. What are the criteria for choosing the members of the new committee and who are the persons who should belong to it?

c. Who are the Rumanian exiles and Romanian organizations in exile which could be consulted by the King to advise him in the matter of forming a new National Committee?

3. The Rumanian National Committee members plan to send a joint resolution to the King requesting that he entrust Visoianu with the formation of a new committee to be comprised of members whose names were submitted to the King. Should Michael refuse this request, the Committee intends to tender its resignation.

4. Visotaru reported that he had conversations in Paris with Cafencu, Gherma, Ventanin and Antoniade, to whom he proposed membership in the new committee. At that time, which was before the death of General Badescu, Gafencu refused because of the exclusion of the General in the new organization. Since Visoianu was unable to return to Paris after his conversations with the King, a meeting with Gafencu subsequent to Badescu's death has not been possible. Gherman did not refuse to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 281

become a member of the new committee, but wished to be accepted as
a representative of the Socialist Party. This would be difficult
because of Gherman's affiliation with the left-wing faction which
seccded from Petrescu's Party in 1946, subsequently joining with the
Communist Party. Antoniade and Veniamin have agreed to become members
of the new committee.

5. In a letter to the Fund on 26 May 1953, Gafencu stated that
   an attempt should be made to give support to a new committee through a
   large national council in order to establish unity of the leaders and
   of the Rumanian colony abroad. He said that on the day of General
   Radescu's death he had received a letter from the General asking him
   to take over "this task" to assure the unity of the Rumanians abroad.
   Gafencu also wrote that friends in Paris and abroad had asked him to
   take over the leadership of a small "ad hoc" committee with the support
   of all the Associations of Free Rumanians, which he stated he will do
   if the New York group assures him of their support. After that, he
   indicated he would see if there would be a possibility of an understanding
   with the Visoianu group..

6. Prince Nicholas reports that he has been approached by Gafencu
   with a request that he join forces with Gafencu to form a new Rumanian
   refugee committee under Gafencu's leadership and with headquarters in
   France. A committee embracing such individuals as Nicholas and General
   Ion Gheorghe, whom Gafencu also reportedly approached, would not be
   acceptable to segments of the Rumanian refugee colony because Nicholas
   is not on good terms with the King and has had Iron Guard associations,
   as does Gheorghe.

7. It would appear that there is little reason to believe that
   the Rumanian refugees will set aside their factional differences and
   personal ambitions to form a representative committee at this time.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Your Meeting with NCFE with afternoon.

According to my informants (I have not talked to Arthur Page), the Executive Committee of NCFE made two decisions at its meeting yesterday:

1. That the performance of RFE in the recent difficulty was like that of a divisional commander who refuses to obey the corps plan, and

2. That RFE should immediately devise procedures so that future guidances from CIA will be put into effect without the two-week delay caused by Lang's refusal.

3. As I understand it, however, it is a fact that the guidance is not yet fully in effect and that the action part of the guidance, that is to say, paragraph 4, of the instructions of the Executive Committee to Radio Free Europe (you have a copy on your deck), has not yet been put into effect. I am guessing that you will get a lot of talk this evening about how most of this has been done before and is already standard operating procedure etc. etc. etc.

4. If you want to take a firm line this evening, I suggest that you stick to trying to find the answers to two questions:

a. Is the guidance initiated by you and passed upon by the Executive Committee fully in effect?

b. Have any steps been taken to make sure that in the future guidances will be put into effect?

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Jesse Mcknight, Department of State

1. Mr. Mcknight called to report that Mr. Herbert Florce from the Public Affairs Office is very disturbed about the conduct of "some RFE man" in New York, who is approaching members of the US Mission to the United Nations and asking them all sorts of questions, for example, their views on the recent Doctors' Trial.

2. Mr. Mcknight feels that this practice should be discontinued, especially in view of the fact that the new members of the US Mission are not yet fully informed about, or sympathetic, to RFE. He feels that any questions concerning US policy on particular issues should be cleared with Mr. Kretsman, the VOA Policy Chief in New York.

3. I think this matter ought to be discussed with Bob Lang. Would you let me know whether you will take it up with him, or whether you wish me to do so.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: Meeting to Discuss State Department Proposals on how to Counter-Check items on UNGA Agenda.

1. I attended a meeting on Wednesday, 28 January 1953, to discuss paragraphs 6 and 7 of the attached paper prepared by the Department of State. It calls for the establishment of "a commission of independent members to study the nature and extent of this escape problem, with the view of determining the reasons and circumstances impelling these people to escape" and suggests that "this inquiry could follow the pattern of the commission on forced labor. The Commission would hear refugees in such places as Western Germany, Geneva, etc., and its eventual report to the assembly would, in fact, be a report on the entire communist system, the denial of basic human right, etc."

2. The questions raised in the meeting centered around the possibility of CIA's intelligence activities being compromised by the investigations of this commission. It was decided that FI, KFDCAOP and the operating people were the ones competent to make the decision.

3. Mr. Lazarus informed me by telephone on 30 January, that the above-mentioned individuals had presented him negative answers on the subject proposal. Their conclusions are being forwarded to the DDP and subsequently to the Department of State. Mr. Lazarus further stated that any recommendations by IO would be welcome.

April 1, 1953

No. 26 Dear Adolf,

A day or two before I sailed for Europe in January, 1953, I received a typed manuscript copy of the "Progress Report on the College de l'Europe Libre", which has now appeared in mimeographed form under date of February 27, 1953, over the signatures of Royall Tyler and Richard Sears.

I admit to considerable curiosity when this document appoared. In the covering letter Royall Tyler merely stated, "It comes from Dick Sears". I rather wondered why this report should be compiled when it was known I was coming to Europe presumably to examine into conditions and it seemed to me immediately that this might be a counter foil to what it was expected I would find. In reply to a direct inquiry from me, Sears now states it was prepared "to reinforce the German language unit project by supplying informa- tion that was apparently lacking.

At the risk of indicating an overly suspicious temperament, which is not characteristic of me, I feel that this report over-simplifies a complex situation. It embodies a point of view that the operation at Strasbourg is proceeding smoothly and successfully, hich it is not. It assumes that a paper plan (for the liational Seminars) is in full and healthy bloom, which is not the case. I have stated so frequently (alrost ad nauseam) that you must live in this frustrating atmosphere for a while before you can understand what conditions are. Acyall Tyler and Sears have never had that experience and. formed their opinions from what they have been told by Davis, Galy, Straka, and Donzelot. The latter in turn was constantly fed information by Galy and Straka, and altogether has spent only three or four days on the ground. He has had numerous talks in *Paris* with Galy and some of the tutors.

So, while the factual material in this report can not be questioned - I mean the statistics and the historical portions the interpretation of them does not reflect the disappointing results. This pertains to the work of the Committee on Awards on the one hand and the actual operation at Robertsau on the other.

When I asked Sears how widely this report had been distributed he told me to the Trustees of FEUE, to the members of the Association du College

de l'Europe Libre and to Messrs. Thomas Braden, Jolin C. Hughes, C. D. Jackson
and whitney !!. Shepardson". I assume, therefore, that the members of our
Executive Committee, to whom I am sending copios of this letter, have received
it.

The sentence (bottom of Page 9 and going over to top of Page 10),
"These were mon of advanced education, expert in their knowledge of their own
countries but also, most of them, having studied in French: institutions and so
capable of forming a bond for the students between their training at homo and
in exile.", is not an accurate description of the caliter of the tutors.

On Page ll, second lino, I would question defiately the phrase
#woll organized administration". Also on that page, sixth line, the sentenco,
"Special French courses were being given to those who still showed weakness.",
is misleading. Such courses were announced, but the propren for teaching the
French language is only now being outlined with the help of the French language
staff at Strasbourg University after a conference with them I called for this
purpose.

On the same page again, fifth line from the bottom, the phrase "tha
severity of the action taken in the autumn has had a salutary effect in
imposing firmer discipline and setting higher standards eimply is not so.
The manner in whichthe action was taken, and the inaccuracy of some of the
judgments, whichhad to be reversed, called forth protests from staff and stu-
dents alike and did as much as anything else to cause present low student morale.

On Page 16, the last sentence in the first paragraph roads, "A fresh
start in life combined with exposure to Western thought and practice will, we
are encouraged to hope, produce a full return." Instead of what the statement
implies, the students have witnessed a cleavage between the European staff and
the Americans, - and the "exposure to Western thoughard practice" has been
anything but inspiring or unifying.

The distribution of this document can be and will be very misleading
by its implications that success has been achieved to an extent that warrants
our proceeding on our present path. That will be unfortunate. We have acquired
a fund of valuable experience and we have made mistakes. The net result is the
present situation. Fundamental changes must be made, which are bound to be
unpleasant, but they are essential, unless we are going to continue a more
charity operation and Edss the real purpose of FEUE.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Information reported by Bob Lang, RFE

Bob Lang has had reported to him the following:

1. Epstein, an investigator for Senator McCarthy, has just turned into the Senator a 150-page anti-RFE report.

2. Lang has received this report from three former RFE employees. The first two, FALAGO and TATER, reported to Lang they were visited by Epstein. They reported this interview to Lang because Lang has considerable derogatory information on them. They do not wish to be identified with any such report. The third informant is one DeGASTER, about whom Lang has written you. DeGASTER resigned a job in RFE to come to work -- presumably for us -- which collapsed, and has since been trying to get his RFE job back. Bob considers his report for that reason to be quite reliable. DeGASTER wrote a letter to the New York Times, which was published 8 March, in which he referred to himself as a former employee of RFE. Epstein apparently read the letter and immediately came to see DeGASTER. During their conversation, Epstein referred to a 150-page uncomplimentary report he had compiled on RFE.

3. ACFE says that it has some derogatory information on Epstein and it will be forwarded to us.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Agency Channel to NCFE

1. Now that larry deGenfville is working for NCFE, I know that there will be a strong tendency on the part of all of us to deal with NCFE through Larry, this not only because he is an able man but because we all know him so well.

2. If we take this course, however, we shall confuse channels of communications as between the Agency and NCFE by adding to the normal IG/Branch I (William J. Turkes, Chief) channel and to such informal channels as necessarily exist still another channel. This would make the job of all of us more difficult and confound our constant efforts at orderly procedure.

3. I hope that higher authority will bear this in mind.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)
FESTY DIRECTOR (ADMINISTRATION)

SUBJECT:
Request from the MPF for the release of $150,000 from the CIA held reserve for the

1. Mr. Spencer Phantx, on behalf of the MOPF, upon authorization of the Board of Directors, has requested the release of $150,000 from the CIA held reserve for Fluk capital construction for the following purposes:

(a) "Alterations to the main building:

Installation of a refrigerated cold room for the storage of food
$5,600.

Additional automatic bottles and equipment in the kitchen and service room
1,700.

Additional office space on the second floor
600.

Total
$7,900.

The original dining room installation provided for service for a student body of 100; the increase in enrollment (now almost 200) has demonstrated that more refrigeration and storage space and equipment is needed.

Housing the women students in the main building with resultant changes in the physical layout has meant the readjustment of office space and it has proved possible to provide two new offices on the second floor for the estimated cost of $600.

(b) Improvements to the furnished house adjoining the main building and used as residence by the Assistant Dean
6,000.

Necessary additional furniture to replace items removed by lessor and improve living conditions.
1,200.

Total
$7,200.

The contemplated alteration involves principally the installation of central heat connected with the main heating system. At the present time there is no central heating, the building is constantly damp in wintertime and the attempt to maintain a satisfactory temperature with stoves and portable heaters has proved unsatisfactory. Other improvements consist of additional kitchen equipment, including a gas water heater, a kitchen cabinet, the construction of a closet, repairs to the electrical system and conversion of existing garage space into a small dining room.

(c) Construction of an auditorium for student meetings, lectures and recreation activities, such as concerts, student theatricals, moving pictures and the like with, as a secondary feature, facilities for indoor exercise during the winter months.

Total $102,000.

The auditorium will have a reinforced concrete foundation, outside walls of pine clapboards (similar to recently constructed dormitory and lecture hall) to compose fireproof straw material for insulation, a composition roof of the same material used on the new territory and lecture hall and with main framing of steel. Satisfactory lighting and heating systems are included and the interior finish will be such as to provide satisfactory acoustic qualities. Also included in this building are offices and living quarters for the "concierge." The architect's estimate shows the estimated cost of the auditorium itself (17 meters x 22 meters in size, including $5,000. for steel costs and $13,000. for safety plans) as $55,000, the additional cost of the stage with the "concierge" accommodations above as $19,000, connecting passage between auditorium and adjoining building, $12,300, relocation of library and alteration of study halls, $5,100, movable seats, stage and window curtains, motion picture equipment with screen and window curtains, motion picture equipment with screen and athletic equipment, $22,400. (All figures approx.)

(d) Re-surfacing walks between building and installation of a few electric lights at strategic points along the walks. : 3,000.

(e) Installation and equipment of a central telephone switchboard with necessary wiring and additional telephone instruments so as to permit intercommunication

between the various buildings and offices. $3,000.

(f) Additional furniture required for the "Counselors" quarters, equipment for the kitchen enlargement and additional furnishings for the women's dormitory. $26,500.

(g) Architect's fees. $6,000.

Total $135,400.

Savings are due to a great simplification in the architect's proposal for the auditorium, the elimination of the new residence for the Assistant Dean, made possible by the recent agreement on the part of the owner to permit the Assistant Dean to occupy his present quarters until the termination of the lease on the entire property instead of requiring him to vacate the quarters this summer; the elimination for the time being of a proposed small apartment building to accommodate visiting professors and officials; postponement of certain landscaping expenses and the elimination of a proposed enlargement of the dining hall now felt to be unnecessary since a limit of 200 has been fixed for next year's enrollment.

In order to complete new construction by August 1, 1953, work should start not later than March 15, 1953, and in view of the time necessary for the preparation of working plans, opening of bids, and signature of contracts, it is of the greatest importance that the necessary funds be made promptly available."

2. The difference between the total of $135,400 and the $150,000 asked for is a 10% margin allowance for price increases.

3. We recommend, for release from the CIA held reserve by the D/P and the IO/A, all items except (a) and the 10% margin allowance, a total of $31,600.

SUBJECT: Good news concerning William Heimlich.

DD/P 3048

1. I have just received through Mr. Durkee a report from the RFE people in Munich to the following effect.

2. Mr. Heimlich has visited the premises and talked to some of the key personnel of RFE-Munich. He was cordially received and shown around. At the conclusion of his visit, Mr. Heimlich stated that whereas he was not primarily or particularly interested or concerned with NCFE/RFE activities and operations (presumably meaning that he was more concerned with the State Department information project -- and presumably MCA), he had been very much impressed by what he had seen. He was satisfied that this was a hard-hitting operations; that there was no "fat" on it; and that he would so report to the Senate Committee upon his return.

CONVERSATION WITH MR. STOWE ON 11 MARCH 1953 AT HAY
READY IN USSR - 9:30 TO 12:15 PM

During the course of our conversation Mr. Stowe stated that he was pleased to have had the opportunity to meet here and to clear up his status. He also stated that:

a. In his opinion Dr. Lang is indispensable to the operation of RFE, but that it was necessary for Dr. Lang to be in Munich more often. He feels that in spite of Mr. Lang's over-all comprehension that developments in Munich have out-run Lang's or anyones capacity to understand it without closer contact with its day to day operations.

b. He has a high reward for Mr. Richard Condon, whom he feels is doing an excellent job. It is Stowe's opinion that Condon needs a competent administrative assistant and that Alan Richie, RFE correspondent in Londen, could fill such a position. Lang agrees with him. Stowe feels it remarkable that curing his considerable time with RFE that he has never heard a bad word about Mr. Conden.

c. He has a very high regard for Mr. Griffith and the role he plays in RFE's operations, however, it was his feeling that it is impossible for Mr. Griffith to adequately take care of RFE's outside relations in Germany because: (1) Griffith does not have the time and; (2) He is not particularly effective in dealing with Germans because of his youth and rather pedantic manner. He informed me that there is a possibility of retting Raymond G. Suing for employment with RFE and that he felt Swing could excellently undertake the job of dealing with the German government and German public because of Swing's language facility, his familiarity with Germany and his prestige.

d. Ile is reor antzing the lows and Information Service of RFE because the drying up of escapees has increases the need for top rank correspondents with depth of uropean experience and political knowledge, so that significant ideas and contributions to RFT propamanda can be developed. He also reds that a reorganized news gathering service will lead to more effective American Leadership because of the respect the exiles will have for its American personnel. Such procedures, in his opinion, are necessary in order to reperly integrate the various free radio desks, their use of information resources and te professionalize pro ram content. He says he intends to have bis News and infomation Service prepare scripts to be used by all desks.. In addition, Stowe pointed out a news gathering service of top rank correspondents will allow him great operational flexibility, for personnel can be interchanged at will.

*   Stowe also made a strong plea for Falcon Davis who is a personal friend.

CONTS:

Stowe is a strong person who in taking over 7 Hunich, apparently with Langle consent. I suspect Lang rives his content because he has been unable to dominate either Griffith or Condon. Lany has presumably heretofore dealt with this problem by insisting upon 1.7. policy control and by keeping an inordinately large Czech, Polish and Hungarian program desk in New York.

I am sure there is merit in many of Stowe's observations but suspect that real trouble is brewing between New York and Honich, especially among exile personnel as this becomes more a Stowe "American" operation.

1.  Mr. Shepardson said that he had gone over Drew Pearson business with his entire staff and that they had all agreed that a policy of silence was clearly indicated that this was not a time to release the "ice-box" statement which he referred to as "ice-box" statement number 1 and number 2. Shepardson said he would feel out C.D. Jackson in his meeting with him today to determine whether C.D. thought any approach to Pearson should be made and whether he himself would be the one to do it. He agreed that such an approach to Pearson should be made by no one else.

2.  When I queried him about the "ice-box" statement number 3, he said he referred to the NORC Policy Statement which states the fact of US Government support. He said that it was his understanding that it had been cleared down here. I replied that to my knowledge this was not so. I told him all we had ever had was a draft statement which had been discussed informally. He agreed that if this was in fact the case, he would immediately send the policy statement for our formal approval.

3.  During the course of our conversation he indicated that Abbot Washburn had arranged for RPD to appear before the Jackson Committee on March 26 and also had arranged for the rest of MUFE to make a presentation some time in April. I asked whether Mr. Dulles was informed of this and he said he was not aware that he was. I suggested that some problem existed here for MUFE is Mr. Dulles’ responsibility and that no-one denied that US/MUFE should make such a presentation, it was still a fact that such a unilateral presentation might lead to some difficulties. I therefore suggested that we make a joint presentation whether written or oral, to which Mr. Shepardson agreed.

4.  I discussed the problem of security in RFE, Munich, and our concern that a security man competent to deal with questions other than the more internal security of RFE be placed in Munich. Shepardson immediately agreed that this should be done and we agreed that I would prepare a paper for him outlining what we thought our problems are. In the meantime, others will not be informed of our discussions on this subject. He also agreed that the matter of working out the placement of such a person in RFE would be a matter of joint study, but that it was largely a problem for him to work out with such assistance as we can give.

5.  He discussed the question of construction funds for the RFE and Shepardson agreed that he would talk with Spencer Phenix in order to arrive at an over-all estimate of University affairs before submitting an official request for funds. It was agreed, therefore, at this time we would not take any action on Phenix’s request dated 17 February 1953.

6.  I stated that I was anxious for a thorough review of Albanian-Rumanian emigre questions and we agreed that after Shepardson had time to give personal attention to details of these matters, we would have a full discussion here.

MEMORANDUM POE: DIRECTOR CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

TO: Deputy Director (Plans)
Chief, Political and Psychological Warfare

SUBJECT: Release of Funds for purchase of apartments to house FEUE personnel.

1. Spencer Phoenix, Treasurer of FEUE, has submitted a request for the sum of $52,300.00 to purchase four apartments in Strasbourg, France, to house some of the tutorial staff of the Free University in Exile (see attached). FEUE can obtain these premises by special arrangement with the city of Strasbourg, to whom these apartments belong. There is an acute housing shortage in Strasbourg so that these apartments are necessary if the teaching staff of the University is to be reasonably accommodated.

2. I recommend that this sum be released to FEUE from the CIA held reserve for FEUE capital construction. The purchase price of these quarters is readily recoverable, if necessary, by resale because of housing shortages in the city of Strasbourg -- a shortage which will not be substantially relieved for sometime.

Dear Nelson:

As requested by you this morning, I quote below the text of a letter received today from Paris, regarding the unfurnished apartments which the City of Strasbourg is prepared to sell for use by Robertou personnel.

"This morning I sent you the following cable:

*FOR ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS CAN HAVE OPTION EXPIRING ONE MAT TO PURCHASE FOUR UNFURNISHED APARTMENTS PRICED AT SIXTEEN MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS STOP OPTION MUST BE TAKEN UP NOT LATER THAN TWENTY SEVEN MARCH STOP TISON AND I FAVOR PURCHASE AS REPRESENTING MOST SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF HOUSING PROBLEM LETTER FOLLOWS SABOLOT*"

As stated in Minotis memorandum of the 9th of March the city of Strasbourg is in control. They are willing to give us an option on these apartments, at a cost of 160,000 francs, said option to expire on 1 May 1953. They give us until the 27th of March to take up this option.

The apartments will be finished on the 1st of August. They have offered us the following apartments:

a) Southern exposure - ground floor - 3 1/2 rooms, plus kitchen, bathroom and maid's room in attic. Fr. 4,075,000

b) Southern exposure - 3rd floor - 4 rooms, plus kitchen, bathroom and maid's room in attic. Fr. 4,520,000

c) Northern exposure - 2nd floor - 3 rooms, plus kitchen, bathroom and maid's room in attic. Fr. 3,555,000

d) Northern exposure - 2nd floor - 4 rooms plus kitchen bathroom and maid's room in attic. Fr. 3,950,000

TOTAL Fr. 16,100,000

To the above total must be added the costs of:

a) Registration, transfer and notary fees.

b) Installing electrical fixtures.

c) Installing stoves and ice boxes in kitchen.

d) Furnishing apartments, (I assume more of our staff will have their own furniture, etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 310

Security Information

It is estimated the scheme will come to Fr. 4,300,000, making a total of 20,100,000 francs or $58,000.00 at 350 francs to the dollar.

I am aware of your reasons for not wishing to own real estate in Europe. However, the problem of finding suitable quarters for the College staff is a difficult one. Providing the funds are available, Ty and I are in favor of purchase, as these apartments provide an immediate partial solution to a difficult problem.

If you should decide to take up the option, we can discuss the financial details of the purchase when you visit Paris next month."

You will note that for the relatively small payment of 160,000 francs, an option will be granted valid until 1. May 1953, and since it is obvious that a final decision cannot be immediately made, I have cabled Paris, requesting that the option be purchased so that we may have time to consider the problem carefully.

I shall be in Washington next Sunday evening and available for discussion Monday morning. If you have not been able to clear the question before then, I suggest that you set up a meeting with George Lefton at which Daniel Church and I can present our views in the hope of obtaining prompt determination.

Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Remarks for meeting with Spencer Pheniz et al on Thursday, 2:30 PM, 4 June 1953

1. At a PRC action on Friday, 29 May, as an interim notion pending a full review in August of NCFE's total program and budget the Division recommended:

a. NCFE be given three months operating expenses - $3,945,104 - the current rate of expenditures;

b. $813,590 to be put in the Free Europe University in Exile account - the proposed FY 1954 operating expenditures with authority for NCIT to draw upon this account for three months at the current rate of expenditures. NCFE authorities had requested that the full amount be made available to them at this time to enable them to comply with the legal requirements of the Board of Regents of the State of New York, to which the University is responsible. It was expressly stated that the activities of the FUE would be subject to the later full review and that the recommended action in no way implied approval of University activities at this time; and

c. Approval for RFE capital expenditures of $1,299,275 for the completion of RFE's transmitter program in its present locations. The funds for these expenditures were to come out of Crusade funds which, as you know, are specifically raised for capital construction.

2. In its action the PPC:

a. Refused to allow the $3,945,104 which NCFE requested to cover its current operating expenses by cutting this figure to $3,000,000 with the statement NCIE can come back for more if necessary, and with the further stipulation that Crusade funds be used for this purpose;

b. Refused to allow RFE to undertake its proposed capital development but authorized this Division to investigate the possibility of using two 100 kw transmitters owned by this Agency and as well as the purchase of the unused 100 kw's from VOA; and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 314

2

3.  Refused to appropriate any money for the FEUE, but directed NCFE to transfer funds from other accounts including that of the Crusade for Freedom to the FEUE, autorizing NCFE to incur expenditures for three months at the current rate.

4.  The intent of this Division in ito recommendations to the PFC was to provida NCFE and the FERE with the operating funds necessary to continue its motivities in the FY 1954 at the current rate. Theos i'wide ware to tide NCFE over the first months of FY 1954, pending a thorough budgetary and program review and subsoquent presentation and recommendations to proper CIA authoritios in the month of Augint. At that time whitney Shonardson will have completed his initial tour of inspection, and can be on hand to defend his budget arst our recommendations thereto.

The only exception to this procedure was the request for Approval of RrE's capital noods. This requeat was made after a thorough examination of proposals by this Division and General McClelland, Office of Communications, his technical staff and RFE ervineers. As a result, Gonaral BeClelland authorized this Division to stalo to the Pre that the life proposale were technically sound. As far as these capital expenditures are concerned the 10 Division had completed its review and recommended their approval in order that there be no delay in getting this additional transmitter equipment in place.

5.  I would strongly suggest What the mooting on Thursday not involve a general budgetary review. It should be confined, in my opinion, to a statement to Mr. Spencor Phenix and his budgetary officer, who should be the sole NCFE officers present, that CIA will condust through the 10 Division:

a.  A thorough and dotailed review of all current activities and new activitios proposed by NCFE).

b.  A financial review in the sense that all financial information necessary to support the NCHE program and budget is made available. Our study of this financial information will be confined to a general raviow to ensure accuracy, adequate explanations of uncertain items and a general analysis to ensure proper budgetary procedures. I would like to point out and strongly emphasise that we have already received the utmost cooperation from the officials of NCFE in setting such program and fiscal information.

6.  We cannot, in my opinion, having granted NCFF broad authority in the execution of its task, seek to impose our Judgment for theirs in the details of their management of this project. Such matters as were raised at the PRC, i.e. whether the request for replacement of 32 trucks is based on Agency standards for truck replacement, have in my opinion no place in such a review. We can review management and fiscal policies in a broad sense to satisfy ourselves that they are


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 315

sound. NCFE officiale sivuld be present at the budget review-to answer such questions. This is their responsibility. If we are dissatisfied with the present management, we should get a now one.

We have, however, the responsibility of making a detailed review of the policies and the activities of NCFE undertaken in pursuance of their mission as given to tham by this Agency. NCFE is entitled to know that ito programs and policies are approved and that no after the fact question can arise. Equally, NCFE is not entitled to undertake programs or activities which are not approved by this Agency.

At the completion of its review of BCEE's proposed program for FY 1954, a review which involves detailed examination in coonera- tion with the CIA starfs and area divisions and with the Department of State, Lo Division will make its recommendations to the proper Agency officials for their final action. Buch an orderly procedure will enable this Agency to have comletely reviewed NCFE's activities, to have concurred in each, and will. Allow ICKE to proceed in the nowledge that its activities are fully authorized and approved.

6. I, therefore, propose that the meating on Thursday be confined to Phenix and his budget officer during which the above approach can be made. I will leave for your judgment the question whether the actions of the PHC on Friday should be opened for roview and modification. Phenix will certainly want to do so for the following reasons:

a.  The operating funds authorized are not adequates

b.  The directive to use Crusade fuvis for oporational expenses runs counter to established procedures and NCFE'S commitments to the public in the use of such funds;

c.  The fallure to approve RIE capital items now means a delay into next year of the installation of transmitting equipment, which if approved now, can be in place and operating by October of this year. (This will not be the case if you authorize our use of the Arency owned 100 kw's and a purchase of the VOA transmitters can be arranged, which I believe can);

d. There are not sufficient surplus funds, account.(exoluding the Crusade, to a ply to the Free Europe University. (There are, however, impressed cash funds which are a three months' operating advances in NCFE's possession which can bo used - Phenix arees.)

MEMORANDUM FOR: CHIEF TO DIVISION

SUBJECT: Proposal for Establishing a Microfilm Library of humanian Rotorence Material

1. The attached paper outlines a project which may be of interest to your division. A Rumanian omigre, interested in propaganda and cultural activitios, prepared the paper after consulting with a number of rofugee scholars.

2. Although the results of sich a project would be of prent value to our Reimantan oparations, implementation is considemd beyond the scope of the activities of this Division. Further, it appears more practicable for a project of this type to be undertaken by a rosearch or cultural organization, rather than an intellicence agency, in order that the results may be moro widely used.

3. It is suggested that the NCR, which is concerned with worthwhile employment of rofugee intellectuals, may be interested in this project for its Mid-Furopean Studios Center. If the CE is not in a position to finance such a project, it is possible that a privately endowed foundation would be interested. The emigre has discussed this project with Dr. Serytus Yacobson of the Library of Congress and with Professor Moseley of the Russian Institute of Columbia University. He has reported that both agencies appear interested.

4. Because of some doubt concerning the reliability of three of the individuals mentioned in section III of the attached report, the following data is submitted for your information:

a. fr. Mircea Eliade was fomerly editor of an Iron Guard (Rumanian fascist group) newspaper and a doctrinaire of the Guard. He is reported to have disassociated himself from the Quard in the last year but this infomation cannot be confirmed.

1.  Sole control of the Bulgarian Guard Company was assumed by USARFIJE in December 1952. Since there was never a definite period of enlistment, members of the Company were free to leave at will. Ao a result, there was a considerable turn-over of personnel, The maximun T/O strength was 200. Poak strength, about 30 in excess of T/O, was reached in 1952. However, this number was inmediately reduced to 200.

2.  The Company was continually plagued by the constant political activian of the adherents of Dr. Georgi N. Dimitrov. It is estimated that a maximum of 40 mezbers were hard-core Dimitrov adherents.

3.  The first Bulgarian Commander of the Company was Stefan Boidev. Upon his removal from the Company, Borislav Baichev was appointed in his place.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, International Organizations Division

SUBJECT: Memorandum dated 13 March 1953, Subject: "Notes on Paris Trip"

1. C. D. Jackson wrote the Doris Duke Foundation on Cohranen's behalf, asking that he be granted 10,000. He was granted this amount.

2. Zurcher Berle & Co. are meeting in New York today and I have done everything that I can to ensure that Tyson gets full backing. I think this was really already being done as far as possible. When I got back, I suggested that this be done and a telegram was sent to Tyson giving him full authority to act in any manner in which he saw fit, including the firing of Kalcom Davis. In my discussion with Shepardson this morning he agreed that the entire subject of the University and its future should be discussed immediately. He will, therefore, examine their position in this matter for our consideration and he agreed to withdraw the request for construction funds until they themselves know what they wish to do.

3. In discussing the FTUS in Exile with Spencer Phenix while you were away, I was informed that you had decided that support would be withdrawn after June 30. If this is so, I wonder how Pacak could be employed unless it has other means of support. Phenix also informed me that bennen agreed to go back to Paris for at least six months on an expenses paid basis with no salary.

Frankfurt is supposed to make high level defectors available to us. I discussed this while in Munich and was assured that this would be done. The difficulty up to now has been Truscott and the Munich stations inability to insist upon anything from Frankfurt.

4. ACUE has a bank account which is used to bank funds passing through the Committee and which show on AC books. Another account is impossible for cover reasons as funds passed to it would not show in ACUE accounts in New York but would in Paris. As a result arrangements were made to have Fugitt's account a joint one with some administrative officer in Paris or to have Fugitt sign a blank check to be held in the Paris office. All these matters were gone into in great detail by Inott. Thayer, in my opinion, is using technique through Tom Hester of making business impossible. Inott shares this opinion, as do others. For example, Inott was granted a raise about one year ago, he has not yet received it, etc.

5. I know nothing about the Swiss franc matter and moreover my impression is that financial procedures now followed in the unity projects, to which I presume you refer, and which are not in this Division, have been arranged at

b. As written, this communication or brochure has every appearance of offering a *new* international news service to American editors. It is called "The RFC News and Information Service.") It is not indicated whether this will be charged for or furnished free of charge to the proposed newspaper recipients -- but in either case it would be almost sure to bring down upon the head of JPT the wrath, indignation and hostility of all the major news services who are extremely jealous and sensitive about competition of any kind, but particularly Government competition. The news services and newspapers have played ball pretty well in covering up our dark secrets, but I suspect that anything of this kind would make enemies out of friends and set the news services upon a course of deliberate exposure.

c. This move points up and invites attention to Leland Stowe's present position and, as such, opens up unnecessary vulnerabilities to the kind of attack with which we are all too familiar concerning individuals who have "written a book".

Bob Lang had no ready or very satisfactory explanation of this matter -- said that he had not known about it or had not seen it -- and that he could only interpret it as an effort on Stowe's part to personally rehabilitate himself. I said that I had no objection to a program of self-rehabilitation on Stowe's part, but that he simply could not do so at the expense of the organization for which he works. Lang appeared to agree.

5. I told Mr. Lang that as far as we understood it there would be no objection to his going to Turkey to see what he could negotiate for himself. Ambassador McGhee's cable appears to have relieved State Department's objections and the only question seems to be one of operational feasibility and desirability as regards his making the effort with the Turks. I ventured to predict that he would run into difficulties with the Turks, and suggested that if he were to fail in his Turkish mission he might stop by in Greece to look into the situation there, which I said we had reason to believe might be more favorable.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/10

ATTENTION: Miss Stern

SUBJECT: Matorial for Transmittal to RF图,

1. Forwarded horowith is a list of persons who are considered to be acceptable script writers for Albanian material to be prepared for use by RFE. It was originally intended to forward a list of persons not considered suitable, but it was later folt that thio nogative approach might allow some unacceptable persons to slip through. You will note that this approved list consists of only 30 nazes. If RFE proposen to use any persons not on the list all that they have to do is submit the name of the proposed script writer so that we may check our files for any information on him. Immediately upon receipt of the name of a person wo will reply, stating whether the person ist (a) unacceptable now, (b) may be used one time only, or (c) may be uned and added to the approved list.

2. Of particular interest to us, and something wo consider vorthy of RFE's attention, is the recent use of Ernest Koliqi for the preparation of a script. tr. Koliqi is a comber of the HKI, a political organization which has beon unaccoptable in the past. Mr. Koliqi is further unacceptable as an indi-vidual by reason of his past. From the condensed information available on him it appears that he "cooperated with the Italian Minister to Tirana in preparing the Italian occupation.. returned to Tirana (he had long lived in Italy as he doos now) where he held the post of Minister of Education 1939-1943. Member of the Albanian Fascist party."

3. It would seem that the use of Mr. Keliqi for the preparation of scripta is subject to serious question. In this script for February 22, page 2, he states a much better presentation of the various literary phases is the anthology entitled The Albanian Writers published in 1941 by the Minister of Education. (Kote that he was the Minister of Education during this period under the Fascist government.)

4. There are other specific exnaples of possibly doubtful persons having beon used in the preparation of scripts. Dimiter barati, a Zogist official then Zog vas in power, a Fascist official when the Fascista vere in power, and now reported to be a Communist stooge, vas used on several occasions. Zef Shiro, formerly, and possibly still, editor of the Fascist magazine "Albania" vas used for the preparation of a script on January 5.

5.

MEMORANDUM TO: Acting Director, Central Intelligence Agency

SUBJECT : Dr. Lela Loszormenyi-Nagy

1. This is in response to your request for our views regarding the attached letter from Dr. Bela Boszormenyi-Nagy.

2. Our files contain only a limited amount of information regarding Dr. Boszormenyi-Nagy. However, it is unlikely that information regarding Hungary which he acquired prior to September 1948 would add very much to information we have obtained from refugees and defectors who left Hungary more recently and who were better situated to observe at first hand the top government officials there.

3. I would suggest, therefore, that in acknowledging Dr. Boszormenyi-Nagy's letter we advise him not to make a special trip to Washington. Instead, we might suggest that if he is here on other business at some future time he should get in touch with Mr. DuBose at Sterling 3-5520. (DuBose is with the Contact Division, Office of Operations).

Dear George:

Confirming what I have just told you on the case, our mutual friend wrote Michael a note the exact contents of which are as follows:

"After you left this afternoon, Mr. Robert Toegeler came in to see me, and among other things told me that to his certain knowledge, RFE had been infiltrated.

"I picked up the word and asked him if he would tell me more about it, to which he replied that maybe he had used too strong a word. So then I told him to pick any word he wanted, but to tell me what he meant.

"He then told me that there were people working for RFE who were either ex-Communists or ex-Socialists who were utterly discredited in their own country and who were doing more harm than good. I asked him if he cared to tell me who some of these people were, to which he replied that he did not come to the office to denounce anybody. I thought I would leave it at that and we went on to another subject.

"However, the purpose of his trip to Washington was to feed information to Senator McCarthy's Committee, and he will be re-turning in another ten days to give him some more advice.

"I think it would be most important for you or Bob Lang to have a word with this gentleman and see if you can't find out whom he is talking about, as I am sure you would be eager to know and to act if justified."

It was our friend's suggestion, and we will act upon it, that together with Michael and Kenneth Walters I try to see Voegeler. This I will do as soon as I can locate him, and I learn that he is now in New York. We here have information that Voegeler associates socially with an individual who, having failed of employment with the Fund some time ago, has since lost no opportunity to condemn the Fund as being infiltrated. The latter individual's identity is known to Michael as is also the basic situation which gives some color to the allegation.

I will reserve further comment on this until I see you personally, or I will instruct Michael to give you this background when he next goes down to see your colleagues.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: Attempts of Virgil POFA to Secure Employment with RFS Munich

1. The information below was reported by a KUBARK source, and was acquired in Munich during October 1952:

a. Virgil POPA has renewed his attempts to secure employment with RFS Munich. Subject is in possession of a letter of recommendation signed by Barbu NICULESCU and issued in the name of General Nicoise RADESCU. The letter recommended Subject as a good and capable Rumanian to General Ion GHEORGHE and Alexander GREGORIAN, the latter an RFE employee, and requested them to assist Subject in gaining employment with RFS Munich. Subject has taken the letter to GREGORIAN in Munich, and has visited him several times, in each instance pressing him for a job.

b. POPA has explained to GREGORIAN that he wishes to emigrate to the United States, but because he is anti-CIMA, the Sinists have informed U. S. authorities that he is a Legionary. As a result, he was interred at Ellis Island and refused entry into the United States. GREGORIAN is aware that POPA is still an important Legionary leader, and that this explanation is a typical Legionary maneuver.

2. It is requested that RFE be informed of the above information.

12 February 1953

At 1715 I was called to Brad Connor's office and shown a memorandum dated 10 February 1953, "Meeting with Representatives John Taber and Cliff Clevenger on February 6, 1953 - Baker East and Baker West". The memorandum was signed by General Stonor. Present were:

Rep. John Taber
Rep. Cliff Clevenger
Dr. Wilson Compton
General Frank Steer
I/R - Mr. Crosby
IPO - Mr. Connors
I - Mr. Harris
IBS/NY - Mr. Morton
S - Mr. Barnard
- Mr. Lourie

General Stoner had been discussing the need for money for more installations for VOA. At the top of page 3 of his memo, there is found the following:

"Mr. Taber mentioned that we had a large Munich plant. He said that this was the alleged place of employment of Ruby Parsons. He stated that our plant in Munich was not comparable to the large plant built up by RFE, that we felt there should be a closer coordination on a technical level between the various US activities engaged in international broadcasting in Europe and that there wasn't any reason why a single centralized plant should not be able to serve Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, Armed Forces Network, and the American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia.

When liberation of the Peoples of Russia was mentioned as a potential broadcaster, Mr. Taber made notes and said that he would look into the matter. He was told that the single building in Munich erected by RFE could also house all the feeders located in separate sites and separate buildings pertaining to U.S. activities mentioned above. He was particularly interested in this possibility."

Mr. Connors told me that he had ordered page 3 of this memo rewritten to omit these two paragraphs before the paper got further circulation. However, he wanted us to know what Stoner had said as shown by these two paragraphs, so that we could take any action we see fit with reference to Taber and Clevenger. Connors said he didn't know how far we cut in the Appropriations Committee. He said that he had warned Stoner "twenty times" not to reveal such things. He stated that Stoner had learned these things while in Germany.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, 10 Division

FROM : Chief, SE

SUBJECT : Viorel Virgil TILEA

1. It is our understanding that Viorel TILEA is currently under consideration for the position of head of Rumanian broadcasts for RFF. In this connection wo call your attention to information in our filos indicating (a) the possibility that Subject is a British Intelligence agent; (b) that a close relationship exists between Subject and Nicolae MALAXA, the well-known Rumanian industrialist now in the United States, and (c) that Subject has ties with fomer King CAROL, MALAXA is currently under scrutiny not only by this Agency but by the 31, the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, the Department of Justice and the House Judiciary Committee, for his alleged collaboration with King CAROL, with the IRON GUARD and later, with the Rumanian Communist Covernment. CAROL'o activities are, of course, & matter of record.

2. Numerous usually reliable sources have indicated their belief that TILFA is an agent of the British Intelligence Service. This opinion appears to be held by many knowledgeable Humanian emigros.

3. That Subject is definitely linked to Nicolae MALAXA is borne out by the following:

a. A report by the FBI on Nicolae MALAXA dated 20 October 1948 indicates that the following telephone calls were made on MALAKA's own telephone in New York:

"March 20, 1946. Number called: District 3000, Wash. D.C. Berson called: V. TILFA, Mayflower Hotel. Viorel TILEA is the former Rumanian Minister to the Court of St. James who has been active in Subject's behalf.

"April 1, 1949. Incoming collect call from V. TILFA, calling from Executive 7300, Wash. D.C.

"April 11, 1949. Telegram sent to London, International 575, signed VIOREL (VIOREL TILEA)..

"April 1, 1948. Telegram sent to Paris, Interma-tional 550, signed TILEA.

SECUCITY INFORMATION

From the same report:
"Confidential Informant T-3 advised the Bureau on May 11, 1948 that he had received information that among the members of the Board of Directors of the Rumarden-American Economic Corporation (Bote: This was set up by PALAKA) are Viorel TILEA and Grigore GAFENCU..."

From TILEA's own statements to the Bureau in the same report:
"...he (TTLEA) could honestly say that MALAXA, in his opinion and in the opinions of many Rumantane, is by far the bost Rumanian citizen. Mr. TILA indicated that there nover had been any question about the charactor of MALAXA and that no one could level any charges against him that would concern his char- acter, morals or patriotism.. Mr. TILEA stated that he was vory sympathetic towards MALAXA at the present time...."

b. In the case of a auit brought before the Supreme Court, County of New York, in November 1918, by Mircen A. GROSSU, formerly employed by MAIAXA, against the latter for recovery of certain funds, the following was given as "Third Cause of Action"ו

"That on or about the 10th day of August 191, at the special instance and request of the defendant, and upon defen- dant's promiso to ropay the plaintiff the sum of three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars, plaintiff paid to ong Hr. V. V. TILEA, the sum of three thousand (13,000.00) dollars.

"That no part of the said sis of three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars has been paid to plaintiff by defendant, although demand therefor has boen duly made."

c. Another source is quoted as follows in March 1911:

There is an important consideration which, in the minds of some Rumanian political exiles, necessitates the greatest caution concerning collaboration with TILEA. It is a well- established fact that TILEA has close business connections with MALAYA and is working hand in hand with him. As TILEA'S collaboration is of no interest for MALAXA from a business point of view, it is clear that the strong ties which exist between them are of another nature. It is obvious to Pumanians abroad that TTLEA should not be included in a Rumanian National Committee."

4. Concerning TILEA's alleged ties with King CAROL, the following references are taken from our files:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 347

SECRET
CITY INFORMATION

a. From a report dated 21 August 28th from the London office of OSS:

"TILSA's Free Rumanians are also satisfied (with the new developments in Rumania) though more moderately. They too are for MICHAIL and MANIU but they suspect Russian intrigue to be responsible for the latest changes. The fact that ex-King CAROL has expressed his satisfaction is also gratifying for them since several of TILEA's men have not given up the hope of bringing CAROL back to Rumania. They have maintained a correspondance with the ex-King, and they would have much to expect from him if he came back to power. TILEA's followers are likewise very pleased with the fact that most of the men forming the new Government are of the same political color as themselves. They are almost all former King CAROL favorites and good friends of some of the members of the Free Rumanian movement . . ."

b. From an OSS report addressed to Mr. Allen W. Dulles from "B.C." dated 5 May 1952:

"Regarding the Romanian diplomat who is expected to arrive in New York (as per my recent memorandum) to take over the leader-ship of the Rumanian movement here, my informants believe that he is Mr. Viorel TILEA, the man who started the Free Rumanian movement in England. The British are said to have looked upon him with disfavor. He is a friend of King CAROL and of VIATA. It is reported that Mr. TILEA is to enter the United States via Mexico and it is believed that he may already be there conferring with G.2."

c. From a report by Emil CHILEAN in 1948:

"DAVILA might be watered down to the point where he is acceptable to the Political Parties, but never TILEA, who is a King CAROL man."

d. From a report dated 1951, evaluated as B-3, from a London source, concerning the activities of Father Vasile LEU, the discredited Romanian exile priest who has set himself up as a bishop:

"From Istanbul LEU intends to visit Max MIHAI, to request the episcopal crozier. This plan seems to have been worked out by LEU and Mme. Elena LOPESCU. Former King CAROL will apparently finance LEU's bishopric. Informant gained the impression that LEU's plans are supported by Viorel TILEA and Major Gheorghe ILESCU . . ."

e. From a report, evaluated as B-3, coming from Paris in November 1952:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 348

SECRET
SECURITY INFORMATION

"Judgin from opinions gathored here during the last wooks
Source is inclined to believe that General Nicolao RADESCU is
ready to repudiate the King. In much an action he would be
backed by the pro-CAMOL clique Gheorghe PAUT, Prof. Nicoles
HERESCH, Col. Gheorghe ILIESCU, Viorel TILEA, Coneral Ion
Gheorghe,"

5. A member of the National Poasant Party and supporter of Ialiu
   MANTU, TILEA broke away from that group around 1935 to Join Alozender
   VAIDA-VORVOD who founded the fascist RUMATIAN FRONT. VAIDA-VORVOD,
   havini: aided CARMEL in decomin: dictator, became President of the NATIONAL
   RENAISSANCE PROT, the totalitarian party set up by CAROL in 1938. ITA-
   VOLVON was an advocate of the "mumerus valahichus", an ultra-nationalist
   policy aimed at limiting to 54 the number of Jews allowed to practise
   professions or to attend universities. In 1938, according to this source,
   who is considered usually reliable, TILEA bocame one of the mainstays
   of the CAROL dictatorship. Another source, in referring to this ierod,
   statos that IILEA who was then Under Secretary of State, acted as lia-
   ison botween VAIDA-POROD and the IRON GUARD.

6. A source evaluated sa usually reliable stated that in late 1966
   TILA wrote to Alexander CRETETANU requesting loan of 30,000 pounds from
   the "resistance funds in Switzerland wil.ch CETZIANU controlled, pon
   recelving CAPEZIAMU's refusal, TILEA reportedly wrote to the latter that
   it would be necessary, since he had not received the treatment to which
   he believed he was entitled, "to rovise his attitude (towards CREZIANO)
   in futuro."

7. In the interests of expediency we have not made an exhausτίνο
   search of the files for information on Subject at this time since this
   would involve a considerable delay in forwarding information. We are,
   therefore, submitting the above in the form of an interim report for
   your immediate consideration.

28 April 1953

MEMORANDUM FOR: DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Agenda for discussion with Messrs. Ford, Brophy et al.

BACKGROUND:

1.  For your information, the following are current facts in the American Heritage Foundation take-over of the Crusade for Freedom:

a. The American Heritage Foundation will undertake the Crusade for Freedom subject to reconsideration after a period of one year;

b. PRC has recommended the sum of $25,000 be granted the American Heritage Foundation for its preliminary work;

c. Two CIA staff agents will be employed on the premises of AHF -- an administrative assistant and a financial man.

AGENDA:

2. In your discussions with Henry Ford and D.A. Brophy Wednesday, I wonder whether you should make the following points:

a. The principal objectives of the AHF program are to provide cover for NCPE-PFE and CIA through a multiplicity of ostensible sources of funds. Fund raising is a distinctly secondary objective.

b. For several reasons, cover fund-raising for the Committee for a Free Asia should be carried on outside the Crusade for Freedom activity. We may at some future date wish to transfer the fund-raising for the Committee for a Free Asia to some other organi-sation. In any event, we do not want the Crusade name linked with the Committee for a Free Asia.

c. The previous Crusade operations have been inefficiently operated. It has cost a dollar to raise a dollar. We know that AIF will be run on a businesslike basis, as have AIF past operations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 351

-2-

d. We want a dignified operation which will enlist the support of representative groups and individuals. While we are interested in securing real contributions from the public for the Crusade, the Crusade's primary purpose is to serve as a cover. It was and is intended therefore that its tenor be educational -- a dignified presentation to the American public of events behind the Iron Curtain and a request for the public's support of NCFE/RFE efforts to give aid and hope to the satellite peoples.

e. We request that before further funds are authorized, a memorandum of understanding along lines of the attached be signed by both parties. (Your attention is invited to the provision requiring two CIA staff agents assigned to AHP staff).

Nothing has been done in Security on it and possibly they can get to it next week. O'Connel on 2591 is the one handling it.

FBI made a check on him in Aug 51 and found some rather derogatory info.

Do you want to call Long and tell him clearance has not been secured yet?

Dear David:

I refer to:

25 January 1953

You may be interested in a dispatch which I received here a couple of days ago and which I quote as follows:

"On January 14, Alexander Booker of the German Foreign Office informally brought to our attention a map of Eastern Europe which appeared in the December issue of "News from Behind the Iron Curtain", a monthly periodical published by the "National Committee for a Free Europe". This map which is shown in small scale on page 1 of this periodical, shows all of Eastern Germany, including East Prussia, the Satellite States, and the former Baltic States. In the case of the former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line, the area is simply shown as belonging to Poland, and its pre-war borders are not set off by a dotted line. With respect to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania, however, the territories that were annexed by the Soviet Union during or after World War II are clearly marked by a dotted line. Furthermore, the Eastern Zone of Germany as well as East Prussia are shown in the same colors as the Soviet Union, whereas the Baltic and Satellite States are shown in white."

"Although Booker admitted that the map itself was not of great importance, he nevertheless pointed out that it represents 'a typical example of the one-sided anti-German propaganda' put out not only by the National Committee for a Free Europe but also by Radio Free Europe. Such propaganda, he said, can only increase the misgivings which many Germans, particularly the refugees, already entertain with respect to the activities of the committee and on the operations of Radio Free Europe on German soil. Finally, Booker politely hinted that the German Government would welcome it if the U. S. High Commission would use its influence with the National Committee for a Free Europe to stop dissemination of such anti-German propaganda in the future. A more constructive and objective propaganda policy of the committee and Radio Free Europe along the lines of a larger European Community that would embrace Poland and Czechoslovakia as well as a reunited Germany and the other European nations would not only contribute to a better understanding


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 358

between the various refugee elemants but would also havo the full support of all Gerzias, Booker added."

Incidentally, I think you are doing an awfully good job on this kind of thing. The other night I actually read through an antiro copy.

The article on este for the masses and the general expose of the attack on the arts is particularly significant, I think. Until the recent anti-Semitism, this field of culture is the one field of Soviet activity in which they were vulnerable before neutralists and follow-travelers everywhere. The tendancy of the intellectual to swallow the Soviet line on culture, to fall for the Stalin Prise8, the high status accorded the obedient intellectual in Soviet society, and pseudo-scientific appeal of the Serxian dogma of equality is dangerous. In a tree society, the intellectual is the origin of ideas.

Anything we can do to show the last that every aspect of Soviet culture has been transformed into an instrument of the State, that the intellectual's rola is important anly so long as he is obedient, that in fact the product of the Soviet artist would not hold a candle to the standards set by fellow-travelias circles in Wastam Surope, and that the. Soviet has corrupted the crinciples of equality on which it presumes to stand is terribly imparsant.

I am sure you are aware of all the above but I thought of it when I read the piece in the last 185ce, and my comment is just another way of telling you what a good job I think you are doing.

Sincerely,

Oliver Hariuosi

SUBJECT: Additional Funds for Crusade for Freedom

1. Reference is made to memorandum dated 15 January 1953 from Chief, PP to the DD/P and to the memorandum of 8 January 1953 for the DD/CI submitted by the Chief, 10 Division wherein request is made for additional funds of $553,109 for the Crusade for Freedom.

2. On 24 January 1953 a representative from this office discussed and reviewed the basis for the request for additional funds with officials of the Crusade for Freedom. The following unaudited amounts were presented for review:

|                                                                         |             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| An operating bank account overdraft                                     | $19,802.67  |
| Unpaid invoices on hand                                                 | 106,1.06.03 |
| Unpaid Commitments for the 1952 campaign                                | 123,294.03  |
| Total bank overdraft, unpaid invoices and commitments to 2 January 1953 | $243,502.73 |

The Crusade officials have estimated that in addition to the above $21,8,502.73 a further amount of $18,000 will be required for expenses to close out the 1952 campaign.

3. It is recommended that the $253,000 approved by the PRC, 21 January 1953 be made available to the Crusade for Freedom from the allotment to the DD/P area for the fiscal year 1953. The use of un-vouchered funds is recommended.

'JOINT' ONLY ONE OF U.S. EPY TENTACLES

Budapest, Hungarian Home Service, Jan. 23, 1953, 1900 GMT--L

(Commentary by Ful Londval)

(Sunmory with Quotations)

In the report carried by an "Amortean bourguts weekly" the name of tho banker Warburg was included among several philanthropic U.S. businessmen. arbury was described as one of the moet zouloun among them. The adjective would have been truly aft if applied not to Warburg's philanthropic activities but to his businece netivitioc.

"In the history of American capitaliam wo have hoard of many a shrewd and bone businessmen, but row have been more cunning or more rendy for any and every wiskedness than "orburg. By protonpion he le a banker--and not Just any second-or third-rate opeculator, but a member of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company, the cocond largest banking firm in the United Staton..
At the same time, ho in alas chairman et Joint, the Zionist Jewish bourgeois-nationalist organization."

"It will be remembered that the Joint has been, to the accompaniment of the eulogies of the bourgesio press, acting for yourn under a philanthropte dloguise and with the alleged purpose of providing financiel nid to Jewe in Europe and other countries."

"In reality this organization--as revealed by the Flansky triul and the case of the group of doctor-wrockors unmmaked in the USSR--has corved as a forward base at American imperialism and has carried out, under the direction of the U.S. copphage service, spying, terroriot, and sabotago activition against the UACR and the People's Democracies."

Birda ot a feather flock together: Joint to given away by the identity of the man heading it. Dr. Werburg, danning the robe of the philanthropiot and placing himselt in the role of savior of the Jewo, has been the bosom friend and business partner of the West German banker Perdomongou, ano of Hitler's former financiere and advisers, one of the wickedent Nazl war criminaln.

"Warburg, the Zionist leader, and Pferdemences, the Hitlerito, have Jointly Founded with veat initial capital a banking firm in Hamburg, the most important investment in Weat Germany of Zuhn, Loeb, and Company.

This name arburs who pronches about helping the victims at the war to one of the main architects of the cold war and, with the golden rain of dollara he helpe to net on ito feet again the bloodthirsty and money-hungry German Imperialiom."

"Such in the likenora of philanthropletu for whom every life extinguished, every bomb dropped means the clinking of gold. Under the expert direction of Mr. "arburg, the principal tank of Jotut has boon spying and the organization or subotage for the averthow of the People's Democratic regimeo. This won the organization witch directed the base activities of the doctor-wrecker and gave instructions for the extermination of the leading cadrés of the Soviet Union. At the name time, however, it does not look with contempt upon currency deale and black marketeering or onmurglirur. Spying and anbatago have proved excellent busineso aloo.

"That agency was recently given a new chief, following the resignation of Gen. Bedell Smith, with the appointment a few days ago of Allen Dulles, the brother of the new Secretary of State, the immediate director of the secret war against the USSR and the People's Democracies, the recruiting officer of the Rajk, Szonyiu, Slansky, and other traitors of the same brand."

"The central espionage organization embraces several bodies active in spying and diversion and camouflaged with impressive names, the espionage organization known as the National Committee for a Free Europe being one of the many maintained with U.S. dollars and directing its own branch organizations all over Europe. That committee, too, has been headed by Allen Dulles, and its members have included President Eisenhower, Gen. Clay, and representatives of the yellow trade unions and of 'Wall Street.'"

That committee has been the motive force behind the various national committees, including the one led by "proven traitors like Ferenc Nagy, Mikolajczyk, and their associates." In Strasbourg and other places espionage has been given a scientific standing at universities, together with various methods of incendiarism and assassination. The "Green International" is also one of the committee's branches, allied to the gang of the international scum of landlords deprived of their estates.

'It is but a few months ago that the Czechoslovak State Security organs unmasked a terrorist group belonging to the international espionage organization. The outbursts of fury of the imperialist lie-manufacturers, their wailings, the salvos of rage coming from the bourgeois politicians, are proofs in themselves that the exposure of the undercover Joint agencies, the recent liquidation of American spy and terrorist groups in Bulgaria and Poland has touched the organizers of a new war to the quick.

According to data not quite complete, in the past year alone 41 American spy groups and terrorist organizations have been liquidated in the USSR and the People's Democracies. We must be prepared for the time when the enemy, precisely because of the new blow suffered by him, will try to harm us by even viler means.

We must always remember Stalin's wise words to the effect that so long as there is capitalism around us, there will be wreckers, diversionist spies, and terrorists sent by foreign countries to stab the Soviet Union in the back. Let us therefore fight with even greater vigilance, let us fight even more implacably against the enemy's attempts to prevent, by sabotage and subversion, the building of Socialism. The frustration of his plans depends upon us and upon our vigilance."

3. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss and decide matters concerning the foreign policy of the Government in Exile. RCPE has heard rumors, but does not know for a fact, that the Poles intend to pay their respects to the new Administration. If this should be done, General Sosnkowski (who is returning from Canada at the end of this week) would be the spokesman, since he knows Eisenhower personally.

4. RCPE is in no way involved in sponsoring or financing this meeting. The Polish Government in Exile has funds of its own which should enable it to send delegates.

SUBJECT: Statements made by Robert Vogeler

1. Our friends in New York have informed us that Robert Vogeler gave a talk at the Sorrento Athletic Club in Chicago on 13 January 1953 on the subject of psychological warfare.

2. In the course of his address he reportedly remarked in broadcasting nothing but concrete, baseball scores are "news." He added that it was an organization originally founded with private capital because to of dissemination of views. However, it ran out of money because the public failed to support it and a governmental loan was made which led to unsound business. Since then, he has become guilty of the same kind of poor programming that he characterized VBA.

3. Our friends are sending down a complete report of this speech. They feel that some sort of action should be taken to stop Robert Vogeler from continuing to make such remarks.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Draft NCFF Policy Statement

1. Attached is a draft NCFF Policy Statement which has been reviewed and accepted by the Executive Committee of NCFF, but which was sent to us without the knowledge of Admiral Hiller and therefore should probably not be commented on by you to any of our friends in New York unless you have also received a copy from another source. Admiral Hiller probably intends to send us this statement after it has been approved by the Board of Directors.

2. You may wish to compare it with the old ice-box statement now in effect, also attached.

3. You may also wish to note Part I, paragraph 2 in which mention is made of government support. It is apparently the intent of NCFF to make this statement not an ice-box statement, but a public document and if so, I think you ought to make particularly certain that you approve this part of it.

4. Finally, I think you will want to note the general tenor of Part III. Perhaps I am quibbling, but it seems to me a trifle full-blown. I realize that NCFF is a separate government agency just under cabinet status, but this reads a little bit as though it were putting on the trappings of national sovereignty.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: PRC Meeting

1. Today the PRC approved $253,000 for the Crusade for Freedom, the money to be held in escrow and to be paid out on Frank Visner's signature subsequent to an audit by a CIA auditor who will go over the Crusade's books and account to us for the reliability of the Crusade's estimate of $253,000 to wind up the affair this year.

2. PRC set aside the request for $300,000 for next year's campaign on the grounds that the Agency should first settle matters with the Heritage Foundation and start clean on a Heritage Foundation estimate.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

VIA: Deputy Director (Plans)
Chief, Political and Psychological Warfare

SUBJECT: Additional Funds for the Crusade for Freedom

A. Funds requested for termination of 1952 campaign.

1. Admiral Miller has requested a sum of $261,106.92 for the 1952 Campaign of the Crusade for Freedom.

2. From April 1, 1952, the starting date of the 1952 campaign, the Crusade for Freedom has had available to it $550,760.81. Of this amount, a total of $105,239.81 was cash on hand as of April 1, 1952, and returns of cash from the field to headquarters after that date, $444,528.00 of this amount were CIA contributions to the 1952 Campaign. Actual expenses of the Crusade from April 1 through December 20, 1952, were $473,439.38. Available cash as of that date was $369,321.43. Expected additional expenses will be $330,437.35. Additional funds of $261,106.92 are thus requested. Not included in the figure of cash on hand as of December 20, 1952, are the funds in a payroll revolving account of $6,000. These funds can be deducted from the total requested if a decision is made that the present Crusade organization is to be terminated and transferred to the American Heritage Foundation.

3. Total expenditures of the 1952 Campaign will thus total $803,866.73. It should be noted that of this amount $35,928.66 was spent to clear up remaining 1951 Campaign expenses, leaving a net of $767,938.07 expended on the 1952 Campaign.

4. A comparison of the total cost of the 1951 Campaign with that of the Campaign conducted in 1952 clearly shows that the instructions of the PRC that the Crusade be scaled down in amount was complied with. Total expenditures during the 1951 Campaign were $1,932,475, while total expenditures this year will be $767,938.07. This year's expenditures are also less than those of the initial Campaign of 1950 when expenditures were $917,000. Receipts in 1950 were $1,317,000, while receipts in the 1951 Campaign were $2,011,221.94.

5. Detailed statements attached. (Tab A) (Note particularly item 3 which compares field expenses between 1951 and 1952 Campaigns)

B. 1953 Campaign.

1. Attached (Tab B) hereto are Admiral Miller's proposals for a 1953 Crusade Campaign. He has requested a sum of $830,000 for this purpose. This $830,000 is an addition to the sum requested above for the termination of the 1952 Campaign. In view of the request of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency that the American Heritage Foundation take over and run the 1953

- 2 -

Crusade Campaign, no action should be taken on Admiral Killer's proposals. However, it is recommended that a sum of $300,000 be made available for the remainder of the fiscal year 1953, to be drawn upon by the DDP, to finance such activities as may be necessary to transfer the direction of the 1953 Crusade Campaign to the American Heritage Foundation and to prepare the beginnings of that Campaign.

2. Should the American Heritage Foundation decide against taking over the Crusade Campaign for 1953, the present Crusade organization will have to again be reexamined with policies and financing decided.

C. Recommendations.

1. It is therefore recommended that the sum of $253,108.92 be made available to the 1953 Crusade for Freedom for the remainder of fiscal year 1953.

2. That $300,000 be allotted to be used on the authority of the DDP in the transfer to, and start of a 1953 Campaign by the American Heritage Foundation in the fiscal year 1953.

## Sec. 1204 of Organization

### FOR MEMBERS FOR ACTION FOR 1953

On November 24, 1952, General Clay and Campaign Chairman Strauss wrote to state chairmen for the ACRC Crusade requesting state opinion and suggestions on the basis of continuing the Crusade throughout the year. They followed a fund drive in the Fall. Experience plans this continue this next.

This would require the development of a field organization on a project scale to truly take the crusade to the American as possible and to so imbue the influencing citizenship which can be achieved for the 1953 campaign. These objectives may be attained in two ways.

The first way is to secure at the national level the endorsement and cooperation of national groups in all kinds of activity, with the wholehearted ideas of securing volunteer leadership on the state and local level.

The second way is to work directly in the state from the city and county level.

We are presently staffed to carry out the required necessary in the short approach on the national level. However the second method requiring a more concentrated efforts. For organizational purposes the country should be divided into four regions with a national representative in charge of each region. This national representative should at all times be regarded as a member of the national office delegated to be of service to the unit within his region on a year-round basis. His functions generally are:

1. To interpret national policy to the state chairman.

2. To facilitate the flow of materials, news releases, etc., from the national office to the units within the various states.

3. To assist the state chairman in succeeding from the national office assistance of all kinds.

4. To aid the state chairman in perfecting his organization.

As the time of the campaign the various state chairman would, with the counsel of the national representatives, ensure the assistance of individuals to cooperate at the state level to carry on the intensive phases of the campaign efforts, within budgetary limitation.

Experience in the field in voluntary organizations over the years indicates that this method of regional representation is effective and economical for the following reasons.

1. The national representative is the full-time employee of the organization, with a knowledge of the broad phases of the work of the organization. He is therefore equipped to interpret policy and exercise judgment as rapidly as required.

2. As an employee of the national organization he is directly responsible to the national organization, and to by the fact under the control, and subject to its supervision within a general framework of action.

3. Working the year-round with state chairmen and state committees, the national representative is in an excellent position at campaign time to secure the type of temporary personnel and help that the chairman and the state situation require.

Dear Belous:

The following is submitted for consideration but without recommendation so far as theFund's board is concerned, since a question of basic policy is involved which can be determined only by the Corporation.

The Fund now occupies an entire building, except for the ground floor which contains two small stores and a moving picture theatre, under a sub-lease from the operator of the moving picture theatre. The Fund's sub-lease expires November 21, 1956 but the Fund has the option to cancel on November 21, 1954 on payment of an indemnity of $61,800. During the reconstruction of the building to fit it for Fund occupancy the Fund contributed roughly $400,000. to the cost of asphalt tile floors, acoustic tile ceilings on certain floors, fluorescent lighting fixtures, partitioning and air conditioning. The Fund's offices take up about 32,760 square feet so that disregarding leasehold improvements rent paid by the Fund of $123,760 per annum average $3.777 per square foot. The Fund has no right of renewal at the expiration of the five-year term.

The owner of the fee has recently placed the building on the market. The asking price is $1,250,000 compared with the assessed valuation of $1,150,000. The Fund's landlord is seeking a reduction in his assessment and we are informed has been granted a reduction in rent by the owner of the fee, justification therefor being the increased tax burden (the Fund's landlord's lease being a net lease) and the less than anticipated income from his moving picture theatre. The owner of the fee has rejected as offer of $900,000 in cash for the building.

In the opinion of the Fund's counsel the Fund, if it owned the building, would be exempt from New York City real estate taxes in respect of all the space occupied by the Fund, namely, the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh floors. An appropriate amount of the total valuation attributable to the two stores and moving picture theatre on the ground floor would be subject to taxation. 1952 real estate taxes amounted to $38,900.

The Fund's current rent of $3.777 per square foot is very low for air conditioned property in the desirable location where the Fund's offices now are. Should the present owner or an investment or speculative purchaser refuse to renew the Fund's lease in November 1956, without a substantial increase in rent, the Fund would, if it were still in operation on the present scale and if the New York real estate market is not depressed, be faced with either a greatly increased rent cost of

the expense of moving to other less desirable quarters where the rent would probably also greatly exceed the prosent $3.777. Our difficulties in 1951 in this connection demonstrate the possible magnitude of that problem.

If it be true that the building, if owned by the Fund, would be exempt from real estate taxes (except for the commercially leased property which certainly could be leased for more than the tax cost) the operation of the building would cost the Fund considerably less than the present annual rental of $123,760. In the absence of a more careful study than it is possible to make without disclosing our possible interest in such a purchase the amount of that saving can be little better than guesswork. My guess is it should be between $50,000. and $75,000, allowing interest on the capital investment at a two per cent rate.

The question is whether the Fund should or should not attempt to purchase the building either to safeguard the right of continued cooupancy or to effect the ostin ted saving in annual expense, or both. If the ansmer is in the affirmative, wo shall see what can be done toward negotiating a satisfactory price and estimating in detail the probable annual saving and advise you further before any commitment is made 30 that you can approve or disapprove the entire deal. If there is a reasonable chance that you would approve, I suggest you take imediate steps to car mark the necessary funds so that if a satisfactory price can be agreed upon the transaction can be promptly concluded.

Sincerely yours,

/s/ William

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Eastern European Division

SUBJECT: Arthur Maixner; young, Czech political refugee recommended by Mr. Ortona of the Italian Embassy.

1. Attached hereto is a letter from Egidio Ortona of the Italian Embassy, who is recommending for our consideration the above-named individual who is said to be the son of Dr. Arthur Maixner, formerly the Minister Plenipotentiary of Czechoslovakia to the Vatican. Also attached is a brief *curriculum vitas* of Maixner.

2. It is rather unusual for a foreign diplomat, even though he be on good terms with officials of this Agency, to recommend personnel to us for our use, and under the circumstances I do not suppose that there would be any way in which you could make secure use of this young man even if you were to find him in other respects suitable. In other words, he is "blown" by the very fact of his having been recommended to us by a foreign diplomat. And I am also aware of the fact that this would be a good cheap way of effecting penetrations of the Agency were we to follow the practice of acting favorably on recommendations of this character. Nevertheless, there may be some aspect of this matter which would have significance to you or to Mr. Timm which I do not readily perceive, and accordingly I am passing this on to you and to Mr. Timm with this thought in mind. For example, there is a bare possibility that because of the contacts and connections of Maixner and his father, a former Czech diplomat, it might be possible to make use of him (on an arm's-length basis) in a program of defector solicitation.

3. I am also furnishing a copy of this memorandum to Mr. Braden in view of the possibility that Maixner might be of some use to Radio Free Europe, assuming that the objection of his having been introduced to this Agency by Ortona could be overcome.

4. In any case, I should appreciate your suggesting a suitable reply to Mr. Ortona, bearing in mind the fact that he has been helpful to us in the past and does seem to be well disposed.

NCFE has, from small beginnings, for purposes only generally defined, grown into a large institution ormanized as followst

NCFE is a non-profit membership corporation, organised umier the laws of New York State. Intimately associated with it aro threo separate corporationss the Crusade for Freodon (the fund raising and cover mechanian), the Free Surope University in ixile, and the Fortuguese radio relay installation, Rarut.

The Committee's major divisions, functions and budget for 1953 are an follows:

a. Division of General Adalnistration - Fudret for fiscal your 1953-5779,100

This is a hoado arters administrative unit in NOTE'S New York Headquarters. It is not an over-all administrative unit, as each subdivision has its own administrative organisation.

b. Division of igre Colatioris adret for fiscal year 1953 - 22

The Division of Balgre Relations is the political centor of NOTE. Through this Division, support is given to the various emigre organizations and to individual caigres.

In the past two years, this vision has attempted -- with conspicuous lack of success -- to create unified refugee pro ps. It is at present in the process of reviewing and revising its tulations with individal anderes and exigro organizations. It is attempting; to exercise closer Mancial control over those organisations and to develop a program using oniere groups and 1.dividuals in a way w ich will contribute more positively to psychological warfare afforts. This fivision of CFE is We most responsive to dance.

c. Division of Intellectual Cooperation - Budget for Fiscal Year 1953-02

The activities of this vision are principally directed to the building of intellectual resources which will ensure continuity wit: the past and which can be used when the satollito countries are liberated. The rivision's activities consist ofs

1. The Fast Eropean inquiry, an outgrowth and enlargemont of the Tanubian Inquiry, which was created by Woodrow Wilson in 1918. Its aim is to pare basic materials in order to meet the minimum needs of those who will be charged with the morganization of the "anubian area.

2. Other Studies of a miscellaneous nature useful to the other divisions. of TCFE and to students of Central Europe.

3. Scholarships to American universities this year will be 80-35 to highly qualified exiles who have signed a pledge to return to their homelands after liberation.

4. Textbooks to replace Communist textbooks are being prepared in stockpile and manuscript form.

5. The Mid-European Law Project, which digests and annotates current legislation from the Iron Curtain countries.

6. The East European Accessions list, which publishes a monthly annotated bibliography of current published material from the satellites received in the Library of Congress.

d. Free Europe University in Exile - Budget for fiscal year 1953 - 4037,431

Two hundred exile students, all escapees, are provided with board and lodging at the University in Strasbourg. Each student attends the University of Strasbourg for his or her formal education. The Free University, in addition to providing board, lodging, and tuition, conducts courses and seminars dealing with the countries of origin of these exile escapees. The University operates on the theory that these young people are being equipped for future leadership after liberation.

e. Research and Publication Service - Budget for fiscal year 1953 - 3300,222

The Committee for Research and Publications was created in November 1951 to make available in currently useful form information about the satellite countries. It gathers information from four basic sources:

1.  The analysis of 270 Communist newspapers and periodicals;

2.  RFE's overseas information-gathering network;

3.  Monitoring reports from all major satellite radio stations. The analysis of the 10,000 publications from the satellite area received annually by the Library of Congress. The compiled information is used in the following ways:

a) Within NCFE - Daily digest of all Iron Curtain information. These are prepared for the use of RFE's New York language desk;

b) Weekly trend meetings by RFE - RPS desk heads to discuss the interpretation and use in radio programming of events in the Iron Curtain countries;

## II

The foregoing is a cursory outline of NCFF and a brief record of our attempts to solve administrative problems. To complete the picture, the following is a brief outline of the major psychological problems we face with NCFF.

*NCFF is not what it should be* -- an integral and balanced part of the total U.S. program for dealing with the satellite nations of Eastern Europe. The top officials of NCFF have no detailed comprehension of U.S. policy, nor any understanding of how they can contribute to its development and operation. They give only lip service to the idea of obtaining policy guidance from Washington. Their apparent attitude has been that they can make a trip to Washington, determine "what *U.S. policy*" is, and return to New York with the job done. This push-button mentality, added to their deep-seated suspicion of Government interference, has lead them to resist our efforts to study their role and to develop new ideas, or reassess old ones.

As a result of these attitudes, there has been considerable difficulty in gaining information about NCFF activities, problems and plans. For example, we do not receive any regular communication from Admiral H.W. Hillers; we have received no list of NCFF personnel, nor any minutes of meetings of the Staff Executive Committee, or the Board of Directors. Even more important than this is the fact that the heads of divisions are prevented from having contact with us, except on occasions when Admiral Hiller is out of town. As a result, for instance, Mr. Lang, the head of PRD, who has considerable problems and is anxious for the fullest liaison, is prevented from dealing with us personally. Conversely, every attempt to deal with NCFF personnel individually is looked upon with suspicion and carried on by NCFF personnel with some apprehension.

The reasons for Admiral Hiller's attitude are two-fold: (a) In his organization he wants everything done through him; and (b) he does not wish any outside "control" over his activities. (Admiral Hiller's manner of conducting affairs within the Committee is resented by Mr. Spencer Phenix and other members of the Board of Directors, but Mr. Therix and NCFF Directors support Admiral Hiller in his reluctance to deal outside the Board.

This lack of consultation and common study has clear reflections in the organization's itself. NCFF is not an integrated organization. Each division operates separately, without any real relation to other divisions. Added to this, the lack of a clear understanding of the Committee's purposes and of its place in the total psychological warfare efforts of the United States has led to real dissatisfaction among the Division heads. They are anxious to know what they are doing, to integrate their own efforts and to cooperate to the maximum.

To formulate our own and NCFF's ideas, we have been and are carrying on discussions with the officials and working personnel of NCFF. In some of those discussions, Mr. Francis B. Stevens of the State Department, has been a direct participant.

Should RFE be forced out of Germany -- its facilities in Portugal can be expanded to take over the job. Programming can be moved to London and Paris. In addition, RFE has asked us to consider the feasibility of their locating a station in Turkey to enable them to program full time with a strong signal into Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania.

(3) Crusade for Freedom. The Crusade for Freedom, the fund raising cover mechanism of NCFE and CPA, is pretty much out of hand. It is operated as a separate corporation and the responsible officials of USIA, except Admiral Miller, have literally washed their hands of any attempt to control or direct its activities. As a result, it has become a high pressure, fund-raising outfit which has little comprehension of the reasons for its existence or knowledge of the kind of publicity which should be undertaken. Among the working personnel of NCFE, it is looked upon with great skepticism and much apprehension. The single strength of the Crusade for Freedom is the fact that it does raise money from individual Americans, not much money, but still some 23,000,000 Americans have contributed. This fact is a powerful weapon. For example, Adenauer's party, the Bundestag, in defending RFE from attacks by the SED, cites as one of its main arguments the support and concern of 23,000,000 Americans that this activity be continued.

Immediate attention is being given to having the Crusade conducted next year by the Heritage Foundation. Mr. C.M. Vandeburg of that organization has stated he would take on the job.

# CRUSADE FOR FREEDOM

## 1950 CAMPAIGN

1.  The Crusade was launched by General Dwight D. Eisenhower on a nation wide broadcast.

2.  The symbol of the Crusade, a ton ton World Freedom Bell, inscribed with a quotation from Lincoln, "This World under God shall have a new birth of freedom", toured the United States from coast to coast. The "Froedon Bell" was cont to Berlin to become part of a "Freedom Shrine", and tolled there over an international radio hookup.

3.  Freedom Scrolls signed by 15,000,000 contributors were taken to Berlin to become a permanent part of the Froodom Enrine.

4.  In the United States, local committees were established throughout the country. General Lucius Clay was appointed chairman of the Fund raising campaign of the Crusade for Freedom. r. Abbott Washburn, Chief, Public Relations for General Foods Corp. was appointed as the director. Assisting companies weret Fund raising - John Price Co., Inc. Advertising - Hewitt, Ogilvy, Benson & Mather Inc. Small mass contributions were solicited. Contributions from large individual donors were solicited later, in order to afford the fund raising campaign a broader continuity. Literature (samples attached) of all kinds, explaining Radio Free Europe were distributed.

5.  Financial results were as follows:

Expenses; $917,000.00

Contributions; $1,317,000.00

## 1951 CAMPAIGN

The 1951 Crusade Campaign was begun by the launching of balloons into Czechoslovakia and Poland containing pamphlets of encouragement to the people of these countries. Copies of the message and samples of the balloons were used to solicit contributions in the United States. Publicity dealt largely with Radio Free Europe. Free magazine advertising was widely used for the first time. A coast to coast telethon was used.

Inadvertently, through mistakes of the staff and the failure to adequately brief community leaders, the Crusade mistakenly implied that the Voice of America was ineffective - that only Radio Free Europe, the privately supported radio broadcasting station, could do an effective job.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 399

After conferonces with the State Department, it was agroed that VOA and RFE wore complimentary activities and that in the future the Crusader

(1) Would not put out anything which might be interpreted as a criticism of the Voice. To that end, an attached leaflet was inserted as an insort in the January 1952 "Crusader", a newsletter which was sent out to the 8,000 regional chairman of the Crusade for Freedom. It was intended to acquaint the regional Crusade organisations with the facts about the Voice of America and to offset any criticism or unfortunate comparison between Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America.

Financial results were as followss.

Expenses; $1,932,478

Contributions; $2,011,229.914

1952 CAMFAION

The 1952 Crusade Campaign was begun by General Eisenhower, Adlai Stevenson and Henry Ford, II, the 1952 Campaign Chairman. The Campaign was endorsed in a letter from President Trumanı

"I understand that on the success of the 1952 Crusade rests the plans of the Crusade for Freedom to build sore radio stations in Free Europe and Asia. If this can be done, and I believe that it will be done, the Free world cau nore offectively get the truth behind the Iron Curtain."

"It is essential that the people everywhere know that we are working for peace, freedom and prosperity for all mankind."

The assistance of the Advertising Council was enlisted and for the first time outdoor billboard advertising was used. Records were made con- taining 2 fifteen minute programs on "The RFE story and spot films were arranged for television with narration by Henry Fonda.

For the first time, fund raising letters seeking large contributions were sent to all leading corporations.

The Campaign was highly organised on the local level with state chairmen in almost every state. The Post Office Department permitted the use of a local post office address for receipts. Endorsements were obtained from many organ- isations such as the American Legion, VFW, CIO, National Auto. Dealers, American Brewers Foundation, and Catholic War Veterans etc. For fund raising

You may wish to speak to the Director about the fact that Charles Moore, a very close friend of mine who is Director of Public Relations for the Ford Motor Company, called me last week to suggest that his boss, Henry Ford, would like to be asked to become President of the Heritage Foundation.

I think this lays to rest any fears we may have had of Mr. Ford's (in roality Mr. Moore's) criticism of the Crusade for Freedom leading to Mr. Ford's becoming inactive on our behalf.

The Director might wish to call Mr. Ford and ask him to "become President if it is feasible for Mr. McCloy to become Chairman of the Board. In discretion, the Director may not wish to mention to Mr. Ford the message passed to me by Mr. Moore.

## SITE OF FACTS AR RADIO FREE EUROPE

Radio Free Europe (RFE) was established as a separate division of ICFE when the latter was incorporated on 11 May, 1950. RFE has been on the air since mid-July 1950. At the close of 1950, RFE broadcasts were totaling 7 hours daily, programs of 13 hours each being addressed to the people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria. The total cost of this earliest period, from 17 May 1950 to 30 June 1950, was $853,937.07 operating and capital costs being roughly even. The next year was to see these costs rise in the same ratio - capital to operating - to a total of $11,950,005.03.

Today, RFE broadcasts to all the above mentioned countries, with the addition of Albania, at a weekly total rate of 1066 hours, of which 190 hours are original programming - some 57% of the total free world broadcast hours directed at the Orbit. The original program broadcasts are directed mainly to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Broadcats to Bulgaria, Rumania and Albania are prepared and relayed from New York.

The estimated expenditures of RFE for the fiscal year 1953 are capital $2,981,120, operating expenses, $4,596,160, for a total of $17,280. Estimated operating expenses (only) for the same period are $21,616,300. A summary of RFE expenditures to date is as follows:

For Period 17 May 50 to 30 June 50
For Period 1 July 50 to 30 June 51
For Period 1 July 51 to 30 June 52
For Period 1 July 52 to 30 June 53

CRUSADE FOR MILLION

RFE is in part supported by the Crusade for Freedom, a major for raising mechanism. From September 4, 1950 to date, the Crusade has been responsible for some million dollars in exiri- butions to RFE and RFE. Revenues for the Crusade, over the same period, amounted to some 2 1/4 millions. All monies raised, over and above normal revenues, or a total of 1 3/4 millions have been spent directly and solely on RFE's central installations, i.e., trans- mitters, receivers, supporting equipment.

PERSONNEL

RFE in July 1950 employed 177, of whom 118 were Americans, 21 of whom were employed in Germany. At present, RFE has a total staff of 1770, of whom 252 are American. In New York, the administrative headquarters, the staff number 195. In London, where are the programming headquarters, there are 1249 employees. In Lisbon, the technical relay headquarters, there are now 134 individuals. These figures include only staff employees on the regular payroll.

# SECURITY INFOMATION

## MAJOR RFE CONTRIBUTIONS

RFE is a major instrument in total U.S. political and psychological warfare efforts directed at Central and Eastern Europe. It has contributed in the following ways:

RFE made an intensive campaign of Stalin's death and linked this event with the death of Gottwald and the illness of Fieck.
During the intensive period of the Stalin story, RFE was on the air 24 hours with all its 21 transmitters on a single frequency, which was switched continuously from country to country. It beat all Western press agencies by 2½ hours in announcing Gottwald's illness and is usually about 2 hours ahead of VOA and BBC in announcing events of major importance.

Radio Free Europe was the first to inform the Agency of the recent riots in Pilsen, the reshuffle of the Hungarian Communist Government, etc.

RFE has contributed in the launching of two balloon operations: one in the summer of 1951, when barrages of balloons were hurled at Czechoslovakia and Poland; another on 11 July 1953, when thousands of balloons were launched into Czechoslovakia.

RFE is an effective machinery through which the U.S. Government can work unofficially as cannot be done through VOA or RIAS.

RFE gives hope to those behind the Iron Curtain and its broadcasts have provided incentives to escape: e.g. escape of two Polish Pilots, Freedom Train.

Interrogation of refugees and escapees from behind the Iron Curtain. Escapees often prefer to go to RFE reception center rather than more official U.S. outfits. Interrogation reports are of immense value to intelligence and to formulation of U.S. policy.

RFE guidance: Highly intelligent analyses of current situations and lines to be followed in broadcasts. Of extreme value to U.S. Government.

7 January 1953

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: RFE in Turkey

ACTION NECESSARY: Will you please decide or cause to be decided the following question: Should the National Committee for a Free Europe in its approach to Turkish authorities exploring the possibility of creating an RFE station in Turkey contact Turkish authorities as a non-governmental private Committee or as a CIA-financed institution?

Background

1.  The State Department haz asked that RFE not approach Turkish authorities until VOA's attempt to get into Turkey has been accepted or refused by the Turks. The Department has now given the Voice of America until 15 January to conclude its negotiations with the Turkish Government. These negotiations appear to be leading nowhere and, on the assumption that VOA will not pain entrance to Turkey, the Department has authorized RFE to begin negotiations on the above date.

2.  Bob Lang, Bili Durkee and M. Wadsworth, former Ambassador to Turkey, as well as the IE Division have all beer in on discussions as to how NCFS should approach the Turks. Mr. Wadsworth counsels that all cards be laid on the table, and he bases his reasoning on his belief that the Turks will now about it anyhow and that RFE is. likely to get further if it comes clean. The NE Division on the other hand hopes that the approach can be that of a private committee and that no mention need be made of CIA's interest.

3.  Your advice on the above question will not constitute approval of the building of a Turkish station or of operations from Turkey. By PRC decision at the last hearing on NCP's budget these questions in Turkey must be brought back here for approval if the attitude of the Turks is favorable.

Ms. Penelope Grenoble, Editor
Los Angeles Free Press
5850 Hollywood Boulevard
Los Angeles, California 90028

Dear Ms. Grenoble:

This letter is in response to the distortions and outright falsities printed about me in the article written by William W. Turner, titled *BANK ROBBER, MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE LINKED TO JFK ASSASSINATION PROBE* which appeared in the July 25-31 edition of the Los Angeles Free Press

I request that the Free Press either print a retraction of such lies and distortions or publish this letter.

Mr. Turner, who spent ten years as a Special Agent of the FBI, is not unfamiliar to me. He has authored similar articles, both during my imprisonment in the United States and while I was detained in the German Democratic Republic, in which he knowingly and purposefully cited numerous lies about me. He has proved himself adept at putting words in my mouth and misquoting his sources of information to lend credence to his major untruths, a skill he probably developed while serving with the Bureau's intelligence-security division. His recent claims cause me to wonder whether or not he ever left the FBI.

Professor Richard H. Popkin, from whom Mr. Turner obviously collected much of his latest baloney, is a character that I feel should either purchase a hearing aid or consult a psychiatrist. Each of my so-called discussions with him (all but one occurred over the telephone) were duly tape-recorded by me, and if he did in fact assert what Mr. Turner has attributed to him about me, then he too is a liar.

I am listing the following facts in rebuttal to the Turner-Popkin fable:

The "papers" that I "carried" when arrested did not show me to be a "decorated hero of the Korean War," nor did they reveal anything about "a career in Army intelligence." More to the point, the documents found in my possession and under my control (some of which were returned to me only last year by the FBI) ensured my incarceration for a longer period than I had anticipated. They also guaranteed my being held practically incommunicado for many months (for eleven months I was not even permitted to read a newspaper), not to mention the curtailment of my most basic constitutional safeguards.

My contacts with Lee Harvey Oswald did not entail any "friendship," nor were they effected for the purpose of establishing rapport.

After my acquittal (in 1968, not in 1967) I did not "drop from sight,"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 4

as Mr. Turner, the FBI and the CIA damn well know.

I have never stated to anybody, either verbally or in writing, that in 1963 I was an agent for the CIA, although in 1974 I did state, under oath, that I thought I had been functioning for the CIA during part of 1963. Mr. Turner is also aware that less than two months after President Kennedy's death FBI agents confronted me with their suspicion that I had "acted as an unregistered agent for a foreign power," inferring that I was a spy for one of the Cuban intelligence services (several years later the CIA, through one of its "former" case officers, accused me of having been a Soviet spy; still later, one FBI agent suggested that I had worked for the Chinese).

The registered letter that was dispatched at my instance to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in September 1963 (not necessarily on the 13th) revealed sufficient details to warrant an immediate investigation (if not the arrest) of Lee Harvey Oswald and two Cuban refugees. I certainly "assumed" that some "action" would be taken by the FBI.

I was not the least bit "frantic" about anything in September 1963. I did not set foot inside the Republic of Cuba during that month. To my knowledge I have never talked to any "Castro aides." The main distinction between some American intelligence officers that I knew and hired killers were the procedures utilized in murdering their victims and/or the methods used to disassociate themselves and the U. S. government from their crimes.

I had no fear of being implicated "in the planned assassination" at the time of my arrest or prior thereto.

The two letters that I mailed to James L. Rankin, General Counsel to the Warren Commission, were not sent through "private channels." They were sent through proper jail authority.

I have never claimed that I "squirreled away a snapshot of (myself) with Lee Harvey Oswald taken in Jackson Square in New Orleans in 1963. I have never stated that I am "willing to surface and tell (any) story to Congress" or to anybody. And I did not reveal any details about Mr. Oswald to Professor Popkin that are "new" or unknown to the FBI.

# Bank robber, 'Manchurian Candidate' linked to JFK assassination probe

ED. NOTE: Recent exposure of what many consider to be improper CIA activity, both at home and abroad, has reawakened interest in decade-old challenges to official versions of the assassinations of John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. As new facts also begin to emerge, Congress faces growing pressure to reinvestigate the JFK assassination.

What follows are the strange stories, disclosed here for the first time, of two figures Richard Case Nagell and Luis Angel Castillo - long of interest to assassination researchers.

WILLIAM W. TURNER
SAN DIEGO, (PNS) - On Sept. 20, 1963, a rangy man with a vertical scar on his forehead strode into the State National Bank in El Paso, Tex., and requested $100 in travelers' checks. Before the teller could comply, he whipped out a pistol and fired two shots into the ceiling. Then he waited to be arrested.

Police quickly realized that the suspect, Richard Case Nagell, 32, was no ordinary bank robber. Papers he carried showed that he was a decorated hero of the Korean War who had gone on to a career in Army Intelligence before being discharged with the rank of captain in 1959.

Why had he pulled the non-robbery?

Last week Dr. Richard H. Popkin, a philosophy professor at Washington University in St. Louis, stepped off a plane in the nation's capital lugging a briefcase containing documents illuminating the strange case of the man who shot a bank. Also crammed into the briefcase was a thick sheaf of papers relating to a bizarre "Manchurian Candidate" episode in the Philippines in 1967.

Both the El Paso and Manila incidents, Popkin said in an interview before leaving for Washington, were linked to the Dallas assassination of John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. They would "crack the case wide open," he predicted.

The slight, bearded academician was stopping in Washington to present his discoveries to Attorney General Edward Levi and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities before going on to a conference of learned philosophers.

## The Second Oswald

Popkin is no stranger to the JFK investigation. In 1966 he published *The Second Oswald*, which chronicled several instances of someone impersonating the man later accused of slaying the president. At the time the book gained scant attention, but recently it was disclosed that as early as June 3, 1960, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover himself wrote an interdepartmental memorandum citing evidence of an Oswald imposter. The FBI knew Oswald at that time as a defector to Russia, and, some conspiracy theorists believe, as a possible CIA agent.

Popkin said he had been in touch with Richard Nagell, now living near San Diego, and had learned about Nagell's friendship with Lee Harvey Oswald. Nagell has fascinated assassination researchers ever since an FBI report filed with the Warren Commission quoted him as saying he had met with Oswald in Mexico City and Texas. But the former intelligence officer had been inacessible. He remained in prison for the El Paso caper until his conviction was reversed for insufficient evidence in 1967, after which he dropped from sight.

## Nagell's Version

Nevertheless, researchers were able to glean some picture of Nagell's significance from his defense pleadings and cryptic letters from prison.

In August 1963 Nagell, working as a CIA agent, learned of a domestic plot to assassinate the president, involving Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans. He informed his CIA superior but feared nothing would be done because he lacked details. On Sept. 13 he dispatched a letter warning J. Edgar Hoover of the plot but again assumed no action would be taken.

As Nagell understood it, Kennedy was to be shot in

Washington about Sept. 26 (as it turned out, JFK left Sept. 25 for a whirlwind tour of the West).
Frantic, Nagell flew to Havana on Sept. 19 to see if Castro aides could shed light on the assassination plot, but the only advice they could offer was to execute Oswald in the hope that would stop the plan.

But Nagell left Cuba deciding that he "was an intelligence agent, not a killer." Flying to El Paso via Mexico City, he walked into the bank the next day for "the sole purpose of having myself arrested and detained by federal authorities" apparently fearing that his association with Oswald would implicate himself in the planned assassination.

Nagell was in the El Paso jail when Kennedy was shot In Dallas two months later. He sent an offer to testify before the Warren Commission through "private channels" but received no reply.

Dedicated Leftist

In his recent discussions with Popkin, Nagell has revealed new details about Oswald. He first met Oswald, he said, in the late fifties at the U.S. naval base at Atsugi, Japan, where Oswald was a Marine Corps radar specialist. They became friends but didn't encounter one another again until August 1963 when Nagell learned of the plot against Kennedy.

Disputing claims that Oswald had ties with the CIA, Nagell believes that Oswald was a dedicated leftist who was duped by anti-Castro exiles involved in the conspiracy. Posing as Castro G-2 intelligence agents, the exiles wheedled Oswald into becoming a "fall guy" by playing on his Castro sympathies, painting Kennedy as anti-Castro and promising that he would be spirited to Havana after the assassination.

Nagell told Popkin he met with Oswald both in Mexico City and New Orleans, hotbeds of the anti-Castro movement. "Nagell claims he has squirreled away a snapshot of himself with Lee Harvey Oswald taken in Jackson Square in New Orleans in 1963," Popkin asserted. "In the picture are two other men, both anti-Castro Cubans, who were pretending

If this photograph does exist it would lend credibility to Nagell's account. And Na is willing to surface and te nis story to Congress, Popkin says, provided protective conditions are met.

"Manchurian Candidate"

Pookin is also convinced that the Manila "Manchurian Candidate" case was connected to the JFK assassination. On March 2, 1967, a man named Luis Angel Castillo was detained by the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation after he had contacted left-wing. Huk guerrillas. Questioned under truth serum and hypnosis, Castillo blurted out a tale of having been taken to a building in Dallas, Tex., the day Kennedy was shot, handed a rifle assembled from components hidden in a bowling bag and instructed to fire at a man in an open car sitting next to a lady. The signal to fire would be given by mirror flashes.

The story caused a brief sensation at the time. The Manila Times bannered: "'JFK Plotter' In Manila!" Wire service dispatches to the United States said Castillo was a "Cuban-trained Communist agent" who hadn't shot because he heard that a man named Joe "had already shot the man in the open car." The story was so implausible that it quickly died.

Not long ago the hypnotist who conducted the interrogation of Castillo for the Philippine authorities arrived in this country under the name Vincente R. Sanchez. When Popkin took a look at his reports, his eyes popped.

The reports termed Castillo a "zombie" - a hyp-noprogrammed robot.

Double-Agent Network

Sanchez extracted Castillo's rambling story over a period of weeks. Castillo, then 28, was inducted around 1960 into a "Special Operations Group" which afforded him paramilitary training. In 1961 he participated in the Bay of Pigs invasion, as a pilot for the CIA. Thereafter he infiltrated a double-agent network, posing as a Communist in Venezuela and liquidating a Communist agent in Mexico.

In talking about the JFK assassination, Castillo - despite some disjointed phrases - was nevertheless able to describe in some detail ordered, "They got him already. Let's get out of here." After the rifle was disassembled and stuffed in the bowling bag, he was hustled into the car which had brought him to the building. It stopped twice within blocks to pick up other men.

In 1967, according to Sanchez. Castillo was programmed to assassinate Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos after openly associating with the leftist Huks - which would implicate them in the assassination. Popkin points out that this is a similar ploy to the one Nagell attributed to the anti-Castro Cubans' use of Oswald.

Until recently, the Castilla episode might have seemed a logcial impossibility. But the release of the Rockefeller Report, with its revelations about secret CIA projects to induce behavior modification in unsuspecting subjects, make the possibility of a "Manchurian Candidate" more than mere fantasy. (In the Robert Kennedy assassination, Dr. Bernard Diamond, who examined Sirhan Sirhan for the defense, testified that he believed Sirhan was hypnotized at the time of the shooting.)

Although the current whereabouts of Castillo is unknown, the Sanchez reports contain the names of six persons who supposedly ran his network, including the "control officer" and a woman who hypnotized him. Popkin's own investigations have shown that these people do exist.

Through Popkin their stories have now been passed on to the Attorney General and the Church Committee.

18 January 1968

SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case

## ALLEGATION:

Richard Case NAGELL, "a highly decorated infantry Captain in the Korean War", alleges that he became a CIA agent. He said he fired the gun in the bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination of President KENNEDY took place. NAGELL charged that "the FBI illegally seized from him evidence crucial to his defense, such as notebooks containing the names of certain CIA employees, photographs, two Mexican tourist cards (one in the name of Joseph KRAMER, the other in the name of Albert HIDEL) and receipts for registered mail, including the one for the letter sent HOOVER warning of the assassination. NAGELL claimed he was instructed to "arrow" the patsy, that is kill him (OSWALD) after the assassination. He contended he got cold feet and this was his reason for the attempted bank robbery, he would rather be arrested than commit murder and treason. The article alleges that while it was suggested in court that an airplane crash NAGELL survived mentally affected him, he was given intelligence training after the crash. Also, NAGELL complains he has been salted away because of what he knows.

## CIA CONNECTION:

None; although, Subject was of interest to OS in 1964 and early 1965 because of information furnished to the Agency by the FBI that he had in his possession the names of six CIA employees at the time of his arrest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September 1963.

Article by William
W. TURNER

## OS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject became of interest to the Office of Security in March 1964 when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at the time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September 1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these names in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington, D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October 1962. His file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints stemming from the plane crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965 made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL be personally interviewed by a representative of OS in the hope that NAGELL might reveal how he came into the possession these names but no further action is indicated in his file and this interview was not undertaken.

## DETAILS:

Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964 when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested for bank robbery.

The RAMPARTS claim that he received intelligence training after the plane crash is true. The crash occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U. S. Army Counterintelligence Corps, terminating about 1958. A Lt. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with NAGELL personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane crash.

The RAMPARTS article's claim that NAGELL said he fired the gun in the bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on 1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of chronology)

The RAMPARTS article's allegation that the FBI took from NAGELL a note- book containing the names of CIA employees is true.

NAGELL's complaint that he was "salted away" is open to speculation. A ten year prison sentence does appear harsh, considering the documented brain

NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was referred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His condition was diagnosed as'depression, tearful, nervous, rigid". Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".

20 Sept 1963:

NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of attempting to rob State National Bank. Slashed wrist night of 9/20/63. NAGELL consistently denied he had tried to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone. He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to Cuba!".

A notebook which the Subject had on his person when arrested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the names of purported CIA agents and other information. Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge, decided everything against him in Los Angeles and made arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL reportedly attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but lost nerve.

(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles, California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affidavit that his passport had been lost or stolen. He was issued a new passport on 6 August 1963.)

1 Jan 1964:

NAGELL furnished a signed statement:
"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a representative of a foreign government preposed to me that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal offense and inimical to the best interest of the United States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May 1963, another representative of the same foreign government made the same proposal to me. At that time, I agreed to such a proposal."
"In September 1963, I was informed by an American, known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government, that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid proposal.
Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this same person to either participate as previously agreed or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person, although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I was arrested and am presently charged.
I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary, solution to the problem with which I was confronted. I am not guilty as charged."

brought in a rifle to have a telescopic sight mounted; he produced a repair tag in that name as confirmation (Report, p. 315). Garland G. Slack and other target shooters patronizing the Sports Drome Rifle Range reported that a man resembling Oswald had practiced there as late as November; the man made himself obvious, at one time incurring Slack's displeasure by firing on his target (Report, pp. 318-319).

An incident at Downtown Lincoln-Mercury is highly revealing. Immediately after the assassination, salesman Albert Guy Bogard reported to the FBI that a man giving the name Lee Oswald, who closely resembled the accused assassin, came into the showroom on November 9. Remarking that in several weeks he would have the money to make the purchase, he test-drove an expensive model on the Stemmons Freeway at 60 to 70 miles an hour. Both Bogard and another salesman, Oren Brown, wrote down the name Oswald so that they would remember him if he called back.

A third salesman, Eugene M. Wilson, recalled that when the man purporting to be Oswald was told he would need a credit rating, he snapped, "Maybe I'm going to have to go back to Russia to buy a car" (Report, p. 320).

Given a lie detector test by the FBI, Bogard's responses were those "normally expected of a person telling the truth." Nevertheless, the Warren Commission dismissed the incident by noting that Oswald supposedly could not operate an automobile and that on November 9 he allegedly spent the day drafting a lengthy letter to the Soviet Embassy. It evidently never considered the possibility someone might be impersonating Oswald. But Bogard will never identify the impersonator. He stuck to his story in news interviews, and subsequently was beaten to within an inch of his life by an unknown assailant and arrested by the Dallas police on seemingly trumped-up bad check charges. He retreated to his native Louisiana, where on St. Valentine's Day 1966, he was found dead of exhaust fumes in his automobile.

The main ingredients of the patsy theory are wrapped up in a story that has gradually filtered out of Leavenworth Penitentiary. The story is that of inmate Richard Case Nagell, and paradoxically, the most cogent confirmation for it is the manner in which he wound up sentenced to ten years in federal custody.

Nagell was a highly decorated infantry captain in the Korean War who, he claims, subsequently became a CIA agent. It is a matter of record that in 1957 he was seriously injured in a plane crash in Cambodia, which tends to support his contention, since Cambodia was not exactly a tourist playground. On September 20, 1963, Nagell walked into a bank in El Paso, Texas, fired a gun into the ceiling, and then sat outside waiting to be arrested. He says he staged the affair because he wanted to be in custody as an alibi when the assassination took place. It was a desperate measure, he admits. But he had sent a registered letter to J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the impending assassination, which he says was then scheduled for the latter part of September (probably the 26th in Washington, D.C.), and the letter had gone unanswered.

There is an incredibly brief FBI interview report stating, in part, that on December 19, 1963, Nagell advised, "For the record he would like to say that his association with OSWALD (meaning LEE HARVEY OSWALD) was purely social and that he had met him in Mexico City and in Texas" (CD 197). Another

report states that when the prisoner was being led from court on January 24, 1964, he "made wild accusations to newspaper reporters, accusing the FBI of not attempting to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy..." (CD 404).

That the charges may not be so wild is indicated by the fact that the government threw the book at Nagell, a first offender who says he expected to be charged only with discharging a firearm on government-protected property. Since his sentencing, he has been shuttled between Leavenworth and the federal medical center (a euphemism for mental institution) at Springfield, Missouri. While the government has suggested in court that his airplane crash mentally affected Nagell, the fact remains that he was given intelligence training after the crash.

What Nagell alleges is damning not only to the FBI, but to the CIA. In brief, he says that the motive for the assassination was Kennedy's move in the direction of a rapprochement with Castro, which was a rank, betrayal in the eyes of anti-Castro elements. As he puts it, an anti-Castro group in New Orleans and Mexico City, code name Bravo Club, decided to give Kennedy a "Christmas present" to be delivered September 26, a date that was postponed. A party was required. Two members of Bravo Club approached Oswald while he was working at the Reily coffee firm in New Orleans in the summer of 1963, and appealed to his ego in setting him up as the patsy. When the "delivery" site was shifted to Dallas, Bravo Club enlisted the aid of a Dallas "subsidiary," Delta Club.

Meanwhile the CIA got wind of the plans and sent several agents into the field to ascertain whether they were "for real." Nagell says he was one of the agents dispatched. Within a short time, he claims, he was pulled in. It had been verified that the plans were authentic, that "gusanos [anti-Castroites] were making the watch tick," and that the sum of the plot was right-wing in nature. Nagell says that he was instructed to "arrow" the patsy, that is kill him, after the assassination. At this point, he contends, he got cold feet and bailed out. "I would rather be arrested than commit murder and treason," he declared in a self-prepared petition for *habeas corpus*.

In the petition, Nagell asserts that he used the pseudonyms Robert Nolan and Joseph Kramer in the U.S. and three foreign countries under the authorization of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He states that the files of the FBI and the CIA contain information that Oswald was using the aliases Albert Hidel and Aleksei Hidel. He charges that the FBI illegally seized from him evidence crucial to his defense, such as notebooks containing the names of certain CIA employees, photographs, two Mexican tourist cards (one in the name Joseph Kramer, the other in the name Albert Hidel), and receipts for registered mail, including the one for the letter sent Hoover warning of the assassination.

When Nagell complains he has been "salted away" because of what he knows, he just might be making the understatement of the year.

[THE ELIMINATION OF A PATSY]

"I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY... I'm just a patsy," Oswald shouted to newsmen while in police custody. A marked patsy, contends Garrison-one who was not supposed to have lived long enough to utter his cry of innocence. But something had misfired, and Oswald fell not into the hands of his would-be executioners, but into the comparative safety of the Dallas jail. The denouement presented a crisis that the conspirators could solve only by pressing police buff Jack Ruby into service.

Although the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald ducked into his Oak Cliff rooming house to pick up the .38 revolver, later confiscated from him in the Texas Theater, it did not explain why, if he had gone to work at the School Book Depository that morning intending to kill the President and escape, he did not take the revolver with him. That he made a beeline to his rooming house for the sole purpose of getting the revolver speaks of a man who desperately wanted to protect himself from treacherous comrades rather than from the police. Notwithstanding the mild resistance he put up in his refuge in the Texas Theater, Oswald's demeanor in custody gave every indication that he would resolve the great riddle-given the time.

Oswald does not appear to be the only double-cross victim of that bloody afternoon: the evidence is persuasive that someone other than the accused assassin killed Officer J. D. Tippit, a friend of Jack Ruby, whose patrol area included the Harlandale Street section headquar-

# GI Death Probe Turns to Poison

TOKYC, March 15 (AP)-The United States Army said today one of its intelligence agents, whose body was found floating in Tokyo Bay, may have been poisoned after handing his insurance policy to his wife and disappearing. M/Sgt. Emmet E. Dugan, 39, of Crafton, Pa., left his wife Feb. 4 in a Tokyo hotel with the policy and personal papers, saying: "If I don't return, you'll need these."

The undergoing psychiatric treatment.

As usual, the Army maintained silence on Dugan's work as an intelligance agent. But a spokesman termed Dugan "a fine soldier" and denied he had any psycopathic troubles. The infantry, veteran had finished Chinese language training last year and was assigned to an intelligence unit for the first time..

![photo of Dugan]

The Army said Dugan and his wife, Maud, came to Tokyo Feb. 4 by train from Camp Zama near Yokohama. The sergeant had a pass to visit the capital. That night he left his wife. She said they planned to borrow money on the policy.

Then, the Army said, Dugan went to an Army camp north of Tokyo, drew $40 in advance pay and sold his typewriter to a Japanese dealer for $22. He stopped at the camp's noncom-missioned officers' club, lost $39 playing slot machines and vanished. There was no wallet on the body when it was found. Dugan was first listed as absent without leave but on March 1 this was changed to missing because the Army was convinced he was absent through no fault of his own. Mrs. Dugan, a former. Red Cross worker he met in Korea has returned to Crafton.

His body was found last Wednesday. The Army said there were indications he was dead before hitting the water more than two weeks ago. ["The possibility of poison is not being overlooked," the Army said, the United Press reported. "Extensive pathological tests will be conducted on body samples."]

Japanese newspaper speculation ranged from the possibility that Dugan was murdered while Investigating Chinese Communists in Japan, to a Japanese police report that he had been

## 2 HUNTED IN TOKYO IN DEATH OF A G. I.

Special to The New York Times.

TOKYO, March 14—The Tokyo police are reported to be searching for an unidentified Chinese and a Caucasian foreigner in connection with the suspected murder of a United States Army sergeant assigned to intelligence work.

A body in civilian clothes, found floating in Tokyo Bay Wednesday was identified this morning as that of M/Sgt. Emmet E. Dugan, 39 years old. He had been missing from his intelligence unit in Yokohama, twenty-five miles south of Tokyo, since Feb. 4.

An examination indicated the man had been dead two weeks. An autopsy conducted by United States Army surgeons yesterday sugested he had died before he was thrown into the water. Except for a bruise on the forehead, his body bore no marks of external injury, but there was no sea water in his lungs, Las there would have been had he died of drowning.

Sergeant Dugan's wife, returned to the United States last Monday by military aircraft. An Army spokesman said he had no "definite" knowledge that the sergeant was engaged in "investigative activity" at time of his death. He could have been a victim of robbery, he added.

(WHAT THE CONTROLLED PRESS AND OFFICIAL REPORTS FORGOT TO MENTION)

## E. Germany Frees U.S. Ex-Officer

BERLIN, Oct. 24 (AP)-East Germany has released a former U.S. Army captain it held for four months.

Informed sources said Richard Case Nagell, 38, was delivered at a border crossing point between East and West Berlin yesterday in the presence of East Berlin attorney Wolfgang Vogel; attorney Ricey S. New of Washington and an official from the U.S. Mission in West Berlin.

A U.S. spokesman said Nagell left by plane today for the United States. Nagell was described as a Californian and former U.S. Army captain who left the service in 1959. In 1964, he "made wild accusations to news paper reporters, accusing the FBI of attempting to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy (CD 404).

Informed sources said Nagell was taken off a train by the East Germans four months ago while he was on his way from West Germany to West Berlin through East Germany. Apparently he made some remarks which the East Germans considered derogatory, the sources said. Arrangements for Nagell's release were handled by Vogel, New, West Berlin attorney Juergen Stange and various government officials, the sources reported.

The U.S. Mission had not disclosed that Nagell was being held. He was not brought to trial and apparently no specific charges were brought against him, the sources added. He was reported in generally good condition on his release.

28 January 1970
Washington, D.C.

An editor of a trade journal, whom I first met while on an intelligence assignment in Latin America, has urged me for some time to "make public the facts dealing with my involvement in a conspiracy to murder the late Chief Executive, John F. Kennedy, in 1963 and the circumstances surrounding my arrest and imprisonment in the United States and East Germany. For reasons that are more personal than advisable I can think of little else that I would like to do better. Put with the copious amount of documentation and background material on hand, that I feel should be adduced to in any valid treatise of the subject, it would require writing no less than a tome, an undertaking for which I am hardly qualified. Then, too, there is a growing skepticism on my part concerning the kind of reception that a topic of this sort would elicit from a society long since inured to violence, corruption and injustice. Still, after over six years of relative silence, I've decided that I must say something about all this, if only to answer the lies and distortions concocted about me in the press. Thus, I have compiled this small booklet, a throwaway, which may be easily discarded at the whim of the reader. In it I've taken the liberty to set forth a reproduction of one of the least sanitized references to my case that has appeared in the news media, an article printed last summer in the OVERSEAS FAMILY, a weekly tabloid catering to U.S. service- men in Europe. I have utilized this particular article as a vehicle to tell a bit of my side of the story by writing an addendum to it.

# I want to find my children'
Ex-Army spook who fingered Oswald claims Uncle Sam hides his family / by Thomas C. Lucey.

UNCLE SAM has given Richard Case Nagell three Purple Hearts - one earned on Christmas Day - and a medal for heroism in combat.

But what this ox-Army counterspy and alleged CIA undercoverman wants is that Uncle keep a promise to locate his wife and two small children.

The 38-year-old former officer hasn't seen them since 1963.

Officials inside the Federal Government most likely FBI and CIA agents know where they are and deliberately isolated him from his family, the tall, lean chain-smoker claims.

Nagell became separated from his Japanese-born wife Mitsuko Takahashi and their children, Teresa, now 9, and Robert, now 8, when he was arrested for robbing an El Paso, Tex., bank in September 1963.

He staged the robbery and immediately surrendered to the police, Nagell claims, because he had refused to kill Kennedy-assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and was afraid he would be killed himself. The ex-Army captain was convicted of the crime and sent to Leavenworth, but Mrs. Nagell was never told where he was.

Since then Nagell has been written about in national American magazines and has worked his way inside a political prison in Communist East Germany for the CIA.

Two major magazines intimated that Nagell had been insane.

New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison allegedly interviewed Nagell three times in his controversial probe of what he called the plot to kill Kennedy.

However, despite all the publicity about Nagell, no public mention has been made of his charges that:

►FBI special agents who questioned Mrs. Nagell about her husband while he was in prison said they didn't know where he was;

► The CIA used the promise of reuniting Nagell with his family as part of the incentive for him to undertake a one-man CIA assignment inside East Germany.

Nagell came to Europe in February 1969 on a hunch that the path to his family started in West Berlin. In Zurich he was almost killed, he says. In Barcelona, he was watched. And in West Berlin he was attacked in a side-street bar by two strangers one of whom had been following him for two days and hit on the top of his head so hard a molar cracked in half.

Fearing that the next attacker might murder him and reassured that the Government would finally keep its promise this time, Nagell flew home to the United States.

Now he's back where he started in 1963 when he tipped off the FBI that Oswald was planning to assassinate President Kennedy.

Working through a source with access to documents on the Nagell case, The FAMILY has been able to reconstruct this incredible story of the spy who couldn't come in from the cold.

RICHARD CASE Nagell first went to work for the CIA as an informant in August 1962.

"Some publications have Identified him as a CIA agent,". the FAMILY source said. "But Nagell never claimed to be a CIA agent. For the year that he worked off and on for the CIA the first time, he was never told what he was. But it was in the capacity of an investigator or Informant."

Nagell had a good background for investigative and undercover assignments.

In the Army, he was a CIC captain who worked in field offices in the United States and with the then super hush-hush Field Operations Intelligence in Japan and Korea.

He had made captain with a battlefield commission during the Korean War at the age of 22-possibly the youngest man to earn that at distinction. Nagell served two volunteer combat tours as an infantryman in Korea, signing up for the second as soon as he returned to the States from the first. It was in Korea that he won the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts.

During a subsequent tour in the Far East with the CIC and FOI, Nagell met and married his Japanese wife in the spring of 1959. Being married to a foreign national meant an automatic removal from intelligence work so Nagell decided to leave the Army.

For two years he was a California state special investigator, working on fraud cases and liquor violations.

In the summer of 1962 he left that job to work for the CIA.

His last assignment was to penetrate the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, where he met Oswald. Nagell also briefly investigated Oswald's Russian-born wife Marisa.

Nagell considered Oswald intelligent, "but some right-wingers were using him by feeding his ego. They made him think he was a big man, important. Oswald himself was definitely a left-winger, leaning toward Mao or maybe even Castro. He wasn't pro-Moscow. He hated the Russians."

"And when Oswald said he was going to do something, you knew he meant it."

In September Oswald told Nagell, "We will kill him before the month is out."

The "we," according to Nagell, were Oswald and two Latins possibly Cubans-who belonged to anti-Castro organizations in the United States. "Him" was President Kennedy.

Nagell reported the threat to a man known only as Bob, his CIA contact. According to The FAMILY's source, "Nagell's instructions were to take care of Oswald. He told him he was an intelligence man, not a killer, and he couldn't kill Oswald.

"Threats were made to Nagell which indicated to him that he had better do what he had been instructed to do.

"Instead, he wrote about Oswald's assassination plans to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in Washington. Hoover didn't reply, but Nagell didn't expect be arrested. He expected to be held briefly for discharging a firearm on Federally insured property. By that time the assassination would be over and he'd be safe.

Apparently Nagell felt police custody would keep him safe from the CIA and from the assassins. He feared the CIA because he didn't "take care of" Oswald. He feared the

Richard Nagell: a self-deluded crank or

him to. He wanted that letter as a matter of record.

"After Nagell's tip, the FBI questioned Oswald and released him as not being a danger or a threat."

Two months later Nagell heard the assassination news bulletin on the radio. "The FBI screwed up!" he explained. "That was Oswald!" This was before there was any public mention of Oswald.

"After the assassination the FBI tried to clean their skirts," The FAMILY was told. "FBI agents insisted to Nagell that he hadn't told them this about Oswald or that about Oswald. But he had."

By this time Nagell was in Leavenworth penitentiary.

On Sept. 20, 1963, six days before what Nagell thought was to be the assassination date, he went into an El Paso bank, shot one bullet into the ceiling and waited outside to tentiary," the source smiled. "All you have to do is be there."

The source continued:

"In 1966 Nagell's sister wrote that she had had a letter from his wife. She wanted to know where her husband was and why hadn't she heard from him."

"Here is the sticky part. In Mrs. Nagell's letter she said the FBI had questioned her a few days before about her husband's activities in the Army. The FBI knew where Nagell was but didn't tell his wife."

The letter had been sent from a Hollywood post office box and Nagell tried unsuccessfully to trace it after he got out of Leavenworth.

On April 29, 1968, after 4½ years in prison, Nagell was released after he had won an acquittal on appeal and flew to New York.

"We pulled a lot of strings to get your freedom," said a man who met Nageli when he landed at Kennedy Airport. The man and his nontalking partner gave Nagell $500 in $20 bills. "More will come where this comes from," the unidentified man promised. "We appreciate your cooperation in prison."

"To this day," the source told The FAMILY, "Nagell

CAST OF CHARACTERS:
Richard Nagell was ques-
tioned by New Orleans
D.A. Jim Garrison because
Nageli claims he fingered
Kennedy assassin Lee Har-
vey Oswald while working
for the CIA. Nagell also
says U.S. Government offi-
cials isolated him from his
two children after the as-
sassination.

still has not got the money
promised him for his im-
prisonment in the United
States."

In New York Nagell kept an
appointment with a CIA offi-
cial he knew only as Buchel.
The CIA official told Nagell he
had heard that his wife had di-
vorced him while he was in
Leavenworth.

"It might be true," the source
through East Germany and he
would be arrested.

"The main objective of his
imprisonment was twofold:
One concerned a U.S. naval
officer who had allegedly de-
fected and Nagell had to find
out if he was there. But his
main purpose was to get as
much information as possible
on techniques of interrogation
and methods of treatment of

were talking about. So they
took him off the train because
he didn't have a valid transit
visa.

"They drove to Erfurt (an
East German city), where Na-
gell was held for three days in
a safe house (a private home
used as a cover for intelligence
purposes). There some men in
civilian clothes questioned
Nagell.

## the victim of dagger-in-the-back CIA tactics?

noted, "but wouldn't it be nice
for Nagell to know for sure.
He assumes his children are
still with his wife."

Nagell met Buehel to be
briefed for another CIA assign-
ment.

Why did he go back to the
CIA?

"It was the only practical
thing for him to do," the
source said, "because of his
financial situation."

Almost a month to the day
after he arrived in New York
Nagell jetted to Zurich.

"During his last week of
discussions with Buehel and
another man in New York,"
The FAMILY's source said,
"it was Nagell's understanding
that he was to have himself
arrested by East German
authorities. All he had to do
was buy a train ticket from
Zurich, Switzerland, to East
Berlin. The train would go
the MIS (East German Ministry
for State Security).

Everything went according
to the CIA's plan-up to a
point.

In Zurich, Nagell reported to
his CIA contact in the Ameri-
can Consulate General. About.
the only thing the CIA agent
seems to have said to Nagell
was to ask him the train com-
partment number on his reser-
vation. Nagell told him, No. 46.

Early in the morning of
June 10, 1968, around 12:30
a.m. to 1:30 a.m., Nagell's train
stopped after crossing the East
German border.

"He could hear people get
on the train and clomp down
the aisle, directly to his com-
partment," the source said.

"There were two men in uni-
form and two men in civilian
clothes. They asked Nagell for
his passport-by name. Then
they asked for his transit visa.
He didn't know what they
"Next he was driven to an
East Berlin political prison for
extensive Interrogation. They
accused him of espionage and
said they were going to try
him.

"Nagell had been told that if
he was in East Germany for
over three months, his release
would be effected by the agen-
cy (CIA), but he was not told
how. On his own he started to
play crazy because he was
there over four and a half
months and he began to think
there was another reason for
his being there. He felt the
CIA had deserted him and
that, quite frankly, he had
been sent to Germany to get
him out of sight or to get rid
of him.

"He was released on October
23. He didn't know he was go-
ing to be released until he was
taken out of prison and driven
to a Berlin checkpoint identi
fied to him as Sandkrug-
bruecke."

Waiting to meet Nagell were,
according to the source:

*   Andor Klay, head of the
    Eastern Affairs Section of the
    U.S. Mission in Berlin;
*   Wolfgang Vogel, a well-
    known East Berlin lawyer who
    participated on the Feb. 10.4
    1962, exchange of Soviet master
    spy Col Rudolf Abel and A-
    merican U2 pilot Francis Gary
    Powers and other spies and
    accused spies:
*   Ricey S. New, a wealthy
    Washington lawyer, supposed-
    ly "a representative - not a
    member of the CIA";
*   Bruce A. Flatin, head of
    the U.S. Berlin Mission's
    public safety section, allegedly
    "a longtime CIA member-and
    Flatin is not his real name";
*   Dr. (Capt now Maj)
    George Raymond Babineau, a
    psychiatrist at the U.S. Army
    hospital in Berlin, who ap-
    peared in civilian clothes, and
*   An unidentified man.

Nagell was driven to the
U.S. Mission at 170 Clay Allee
and interviewed by Babincau.

"That was probably because
Nagell had played crazy with
the East Germans," the source
said.

Washington lawyer New was
also present.

"Somebody brought Nagell
a cup of coffee," the source
continued. "Nobody else had
coffee. Nagell drank a small
portion of his coffee. It was
black but it tasted more bitter
than ordinary coffee. Approxi-
mately five minutes later he

![photo of Nagell's children]

began feeling sleepy and
thought he was under the in-
fluence of a drug. He went to
the bathroom and looked at
his eyes in a mirror. They were
almost pinpoints and he was
feeling exceedingly sleepy.

"Back in the room he asked,
'Did anybody put something
in my coffee?'

"Dr. Babineau said no; New
said nothing. Nagell began to
feel so sleepy he had to oc-
casionally stand up to stay a-
wake. Finally, he asked to be
examined by a civilian psychi-
atrist if there was any ques-
tion of his sanity.

"'No,' the doctor said, 'as far
as I'm concerned you're free
to go.'

"New spoke to the doctor In
a comer
the doctor kept
shaking his head no- and
then New told Nagell, 'I think
you ought to leave for the
United States. The German
newspapers are going to pick
this thing up any moment and
might want to talk to you. I
don't think you should talk to
tiiem.'

"Nagell said he wanted to go
back to Zurich first to pick up
his belongings - to be exact,
certain documents in a safe de-
posit box. Nagell keeps records,
plenty of them."

When Nagell was driven to
Tempelhof Airport, New ac-
companied him and walted un-
til he boarded the plane. Some
time during their talk New
asked Nagell about his disabil-
Ity-Nagell was getting a 60
percent disability for service-

## 'You must get out of Berlin!'

connected injuries and New promised him help in getting a disability retirement.

"But," the source added, New also told Nagell: "Of course, this (offer of help in getting a disability retirement) is predicated on your staying away from the news media.'"

On the afternoon flight to Stuttgart Nagell fell asleep, convincing him that he had been given a drug or a barbiturate.

Because of fog he didn't get to Zurich until 4 a.m. and "he was feeling extremely sick," the source sald. "He rested for a few hours and went to the U.S. Consulate General, New had told him to stay away from the 'consulate in Zurich because 'they will question you and send it to Washington.' Nagell couldn't understand New's reasoning, but he went to the consulate to get a doctor, not to tell them about Berlin. He was drastically sick and wanted a doctor. He thought he was dy- ing."

Referred to a civilian doctor, Nagell was told "he had been given an overdose of Seconal, a most potent sleeping drug." Nagell was sick for about six days.

Meanwhile, he was also waiting to hear from New, who had promised to phone him in two or three days. Nagell had told him he wanted the search for his family to be agreed upon before he returned, to the States.

Twice Nagell called New's room at the Berlin Hilton. First New was "unavailable," then he had checked out for the U.S. (Later, back in Washington, New allegedly explained it had been "unadvisable" to go to Zurich because the East Germans might have tapped his phone and he didn't want them to know Nagell was there. Nagell didn't buy that.)

With New hot showing up to discuss the search for his faml- ly, Nagell violated his instruc- tions and went to the consulate for help.

On his first visit Nagell found "they had a classified file on him and knew he had been in East Berlin," the source con- tinued. "But he refused to an- swer questions about his im- prisonment and told them about New's promise."

"The next time, he told the consulate he was angry that he had not heard from New and that if he didn't get help he was going to the news media. This is when he was offered State Department help in locating his family predicated on his early return to the United States. Nagell agreed and flew back to New York."

In New York, Nagell waited about two or three weeks to hear from the State Dept. When he didn't he contacted a State Dept, agency in New York and was allegedly told that a letter would be sent to Washington.

"That was the last time Na- gell heard from them," the source said. "He never received a copy of the letter to Washing- ton, as promised, and they were always unavailable when he called."

Meanwhile, Nagell was see- ing New in Washington and called in person at the State Dept.

"They told him that the State Department didn't have the facilities to search for the children," the source said, "but on account of the circumstances surrounding the case and 'be- cause one of our employes ap- parently made a promise in Zu- rich,' they would conduct a search for his children and de- termine whether he was mar- ried or divorced.

"He never heard from them again. When he called they were quote unavailable un quote."

Through a lawyer in New's office, described as a luxurious suite visited by Pentagon of- ficers in civilian clothes, Nagell got an appointment at the VA for "a-two-and-a-half-minute physical with his clothes on,' according to the source. "Two hours later he was awarded a 100 percent disability allow- ance for a nervous condition."

"Nagell went back to New and told him they wanted to tag him (Nagell) with a nervous condition to destroy his credi- bility."

For good reason, Nagell wor- ried that a nervous condition might be used to tag him as a nut who didn't know what he was talking about.

In July 1968, while Nagell was in the Communist prison, Edward Jay Epstein, author of a book on the Warren Com- mission, wrote an article in the New Yorker magazine at- tacking New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's in- vestigation of the Kennedy as- sassination.

Epstein described Nagell as "another witness found in the mail (of crank letters, publicity seckers and bogus tips)... an Inmate of a Federal institution for the criminally insane in Springfield, Miss. . court records indicated that Nagell had suffered brain damage in an airplane crash in 1957."

Nagell's rebuttal:

He was sent to the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield to determine whether he could stand trial and when he was up for parole;

On each occasion he was found mentally competent;

In 1954 (not in 1957) he was the only survivor of a B52 crash at Baltimore's Friendship Airport (not in Cambodia, as reported in Ram- parts magazine by former FBI agent William W. Turner);

After hospitalization he returned to Army Intelligence School, received a top secret clearance and was assigned to the CIC;

A June 17, 1966, psychiatric report from the Springfield Medical Center stated there was no "evidence or finding suggestible of brain damage.

All this runaround in Washington convinced Nagell that no one in the States was going to help him find his family. He decided to return to Europe.

# In Zurich somoone tried to kill him

On Feb. 21 of this year he flew from Mexico City to Zurich. But the vice-consul who had promised State Dept. help last fall was no longer there. Nagell asked for the man he claimed to be the CIA station chief. He, too, was gone.

Sent to the consulate's politi- cal section, Nagell told them of the promises he'd been given and threatened to go to Swiss newspapers about a CIA agent in Bern, the Swiss capital.

"A member of the consulate asked Nagell to give them two weeks and telexed Washing- ton," the source said. "But then one night there was an at- tempt on Nagell's life and he left for Barcelona the next day."

"There he contacted the U.S. Consulate General and told them why he had left Zurich and asked that Zurich's reply from Washington be sent to Barcelona."

"Nagell was in Barcelona for two weeks. But then he real- ized he was being watched and left to see an ex-Army intelli- gence officer at the American Embassy in Madrid.

"Again he stayed for two weeks. The embassy gave him no satisfaction, not even telling him what Washington had said. So he decided to go back to Berlin where this thing started and made some prom- ises to himself one of them being that if he didn't find his children he would go to the news media."

He was referred to Andor Klay and Bruce Flatin, two of the men who had met Nagell when he came from East Berlin, and eventually to a :

Kenneth Hill in the passport section.

"A week or two later," the source continued, "they finally got confirmation from Washing- ton that they had been unable to locate Nagell's children so far but were continuing their efforts."

"So he finally agreed to go back to the States as long as the State Department was con- tinuing their efforts."

Pointing out that he had spent a great deal of his money "running around," Nagell asked for Government transportation home and was refused.

On April 19 or 20 Nagell real- ized he was under surveillance.

"Around 10:30 on the night of April 22, Nagell was walk- ing down Kurfuerstendamm when he lost his tail," the source continued. "They just disappeared. He didn't try to lose them."

"Nagell then went down a side street and into a small res- taurant with a bar.

"He ordered a beer and was standing at the bar, talking to a guy on his right, when he saw the door open and two men came directly toward him.

"Nageli was getting ready to tell the men he didn't speak German when he saw one pick something out of his pocket and swing at him. Nageli turned and was hit on the back of the head."

Police took Nagell to the Albrecht Achilles Hospital. When he told the Germans he thought he had been hit by the CIA, "they called an American from the CID, a British representative (ap- parently the side street was in the British Sector) and a mem- ber of the Berlin political police."

Around midnight Nagell went to the U.S. Mission and asked for Hill in the passport section. Instead, he got the Army staff duty officer and a CIC agent.

"He gave his bloody shirt and T-shirt in a bag to the CIC agent," the source sald, "and told him to give it to Hill.

'If something happens to me,' he told the agent, 'the responsibility is going to be pinned because I'm going to the papers.'

"Back In his hotel, Nagell was worried that he was going to be killed."

In the morning he went to the Army hospital and then to Hill in the consulate.

"Hill had the bloody cloth- ing. 'You must get out of Berlin,' he told Nagell. 'We cannot give you protection here. The German police think it's either mistaken Identity or the MIS.'

'Last night I thought some- body wanted to kill me,' Nagell replied. 'Now I take it as (only) a warning.' "

(Later, Hill told The FAMILY he considered Nagell merely "a private American citizen traveling abroad." He added: "Ninety-nine and a half per- cent of his story is fantasy." Hill confirmed that he had re- ceived Nagell's bloody clothing and that Nagell had come to him with a stitched-up head wound. But he would only say that the attack "is his story, not that I have any other story about it.")

But shortly after that Nagell was placed on orders as an ambulatory patient and sent on the Berlin duty train to Frank- furt. His orders also put him on a military flight back to the States.

That's where he apparently is now.

But he still doesn't know if he's married or divorced and the whereabouts of his nil- dren.

# OVERSEAS FAMILY article

confirm each and every assertion made by its author, Thomas C. Lucey. Mr. Lucey, despite his citing a substantial number of inaccuracies, has nonetheless depicted a vast area of what may be termed the fundamental truth. With this in mind, I have tried to set the record straight only insofar as it pertains to those inaccuracies - and omissions - which in my opinion reflect adversely on the whole.

In order to view Mr. Lucey's account in a somewhat different perspective, I shall begin by advising that I first went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency much earlier than August 1962. It was during the winter of 1955-56, while assigned as a Case Review Officer with the Counter Intelligence Corps at Los Angeles, that I was initially recruited into the CIA's farflung network of informants and agents, one of a number I suppose, within the Defense Department's intelligence community who helped the Agency keep an eye on its not always tame competitor. My recruitment was, handled by a Herbert Leibacher, an agent of the CIA's Los Angeles office, and a Joe Davanon, later identified to me through photographs as an official from CIA headquarters, then located on "E" street in Washington, D.C. Motivated by a degree of naivete and the Agency's subtle reminders that I owed a greater duty to my country than to the military establishment, I served as a non-paid, confidential informant off and on until my resignation from the Army in October 1959. A complete description of the information I supplied to the Agency during my military career would only add to what must perforce become a lengthy addendum; may it suffice to say that it did not always seem germane to intelligence affairs, but when it did it consisted mainly of an assortment of data that for so-called discretionary reasons was seldom passed on to the Agency (or for that matter, to our own higher echelons) through regular channels.

Mr. Lucey's statement, "Being married to a foreign national meant an automatic removal from intelligence work so Nagell decided to leave the Army," is misleading and incorrect in its entirety. The only military intelligence organization from which an individual is normally removed subsequent to marrying a foreign national is the CIC - primarily a security type organ - and this rule does not necessarily apply when the agent is an enlisted man or warrant officer. As a commissioned officer, I was declared ineligible for further duty with the CIC effective 14 April 1959, a full year after my marriage to a foreign national. I was not barred from assignment to other, even more sensitive, MI organizations such as Field Operations Intelligence, then the clandestine espionage department of military intelligence. As for the reasons I left the Army, they were clearly if euphemistically explained in my second letter of resignation, dated 31 August 1959, namely: "I desire to tender my resignation because I wish to further my civilian education. It is not possible for me to pursue the curriculum of which I am desirous while on active duty. Also, compassionate reasons of a personal nature exist for desiring to tender my resignation at this time."

My patronage under the CIA did not end with my discharge from the Army and ensuing employment in December 1959 as an investigator for the State of California; in fact, henceforth I was offered remuneration for my services, however nominal it sometimes was. What my new tasks comprised is of no real pertinence to this addendum or to later developments, except perhaps to mention that one of my contacts said he worked out of "Domestic Intelligence," possibly the forerunner of the present-day Domestic Operations Division, which illegally keeps tabs on a wide range of American civilian organizations and activities. I should also point out that I did not quit my position with the State of California "to work for the CIA," as implied by Mr. Lucey. I was dismissed, in June 1962, at my own option and in my opinion for doing my job. (The following month I was shot through the right chest during an altercation with a person whose identity I have never disclosed . . . not through the left chest by myself, my wife, an Alcoholic Beverage Control inspector then under investigation or by a Los Angeles police officer "because of communistic implications," as has been reported at various times by various sources).

Texas on 20 September 19 I was employed by the Agency in a capacity which can be accurately described as that of an agent, in every sense of the word. My assignments varied and necessitated travel to three Latin American nations and many states, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. They also necessitated my taking on cover employment for one week in New York and for about ten weeks in Los Angeles, though usually I posed as a tourist, an investigator for the Immigration & Naturalization Service or as a researcher for a private firm, the appropriate credentials being furnished to me by the CIA. To sum it up briefly, I operated in Mexico City at the onset of the Cuban Missile Crisis in an effort aimed chiefly at the Soviet government; I conducted inquiries relative to "dissident" members of several Cuban refugee groups based in the United States; I checked out an alleged connection between a Miami resident named Eladio Del Valle and New Orleans CIA informant Sergio Arcacha-Smith; I investigated an associate of the now deceased right-wing extremist David W. Ferrie of New Orleans, as I did the activities of left-wingers Vaughn L. Snipes and his wife, Priscilla, near Venice, California, and others; I conducted a surveillance on a man, said to have been an ex-CIA employee, observed talking to MRP leader Manuel Artime and former Cuban senator/racketeer Rolando Masferrer; I inquired into an allegation that Marina Oswald intended to divorce her husband and return to the U.S.S.R. (although I never stated that I met her personally, as was reported by the FBI and Secret Service); and I performed courier duties and acted as a cut-out. At the time of my arrest I was operating in an undercover role, having become involved in a domestic-inspired plot to assassinate President Kennedy and, leastwise ostensibly, other highly-placed government officials.

Mr. Lucey goes on to state that my last assignment at the time "was to penetrate the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, where he met Oswald." Such statement is also incorrect. I was never a member, bona-fide or otherwise, of the FPCC. And my conversations with FPCC functionaries like Steve Roberts, an official of the Socialist Workers Party at Los Angeles, could hardly be construed as a penetration. Furthermore, I had been introduced to Mr. Oswald long before the FPCC came into existence, albeit under an assumed name.

As to the allusion that I told "Bob" I was an intelligence man, not a killer, therefore I couldn't kill Mr. Oswald, while the reference is true its connotation is deceptive. I had killed before and I had participated in homicides under the auspices of both MI and the CIA (one instance being the part I played in the February 1958 abduction-interrogation-murder of an FOI agent, a U.S. soldier, MSCT Emmett E. Dugan, from Crafton, Pa., suspected of having defected in place to the Chinese), under the guise that an American variation of the Soviet "wet affair" was the only alternative, that it was either essential to some overall intelligence effort or in the best interests of our national security. And it was a similar-sounding argument, ultimately reduced to a threat, that was advanced to me by Robert Graham as an incentive to dispose of Mr. Oswald in September 1963. But my refusal to do so had absolutely no bearing on the reason for effecting my arrest in the manner I chose, nor did it engender in me fear of reprisal by the CIA.

Pertaining to my arrest and convictions at El Paso, Texas, which the official spokesmen and the press have so neatly labeled as being for "bank robbery," let one of the government's own spurious records, the appelate court decision that finally yawned a judgement of acquittal in my case, give its version: "The charge was then, and is now, entering a federally insured bank with intent to rob." What the record aptly ignores is the fact that two juries, incensed by the prosecution's innuendoes in and out of the courtroom (and by the ramifications of perjured testimony and a false Bureau of Prisons report made available to the jury during its deliberations at the second trial - though never formally admitted into evidence) that I was a Communist, no doubt a very red spy, twice convicted me of having "intended" to take by force and violence one hundred dollars worth of Travelers Cheques from a bank teller.

I shall not herein attempt to list even generally the injustices to which I was subjected by a corrupt judicial system, nor shall I bother to enumerate the cruelties

Most of them are adequaly detailed in my 1967 Memorandum in Support of Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, sworn to and subscribed before William R. Martin (a former member of the CIA's Dirty Tricks Division, who by his own admission is still in "the reserves"). But I shall opine that if President Kennedy had not met his demise when and where he did, I would not have been brought to trial on charges of commiting a felony.

While my return to the fold of the CIA in May 1968 may have been the only "practical thing" for me to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, as a few old bank account passbooks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary that Mr. Lucey has portrayed). Nor was it because of any peculiar allegiance to those who had tossed me on the scrap heap for the sake of expediency 4 years earlier, love of country, masochistic tendencies or wont of further intrigue. And while it remains axiomatic in my mind that the sole requisite for one's use by the Agency is his qualification to fit into whatever may happen to be the scheme of things, even this did not apply in my circumstance, not really. I agreed to go back out into the cold, so to speak, strictly for personal reasons and I think the explanation is wisely left at that for now.

My mission inside East Germany - if indeed it was a mission - was neither as well-defined nor as elementary as Mr. Lucey has perceived. I am sure the CIA knows all it needs to know about American defectors in Berlin and the modus operandi of the MfS. In fact, the mission was net directed against East Germany, per se. Preparations bore the trademarks of an authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the main to another nation. That I was unable to comprehend the German language, that I had been a recent, unwilling guest of the U.S. Attorney General, branded a Communist in the public records, etc., merely served to strengthen an already plausible cover built up by chance rather than by design. Paradoxically, the chinks in the armor were that the cover was not wholly untrue, the MfS (unlike the FBI) not in the least irresponsible to the laws and policies of its government. In the past I had engaged in certain covert intelligence activities hositle to other socialist states, to which as an integral part of my cover - I freely confessed. Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely had neglected to tell me during the briefings that these previous activities constituted a violation of the criminal statutes of the GDR, warranting a maximum penalty of death upon conviction. By inadvertence or by plan I found myself in a not altogether unfamiliar predicament. If I had confessed to my real mission, assuming that it was genuine, without doubt I would have been spared execution, probably even escaped long-term imprisonment. Instead, I selected what I considered to be a better alternative . . . and gained my freedom. As for my treatment by the MfS, from begining to end it was far more gentle than that experienced beneath the cudgel of the U.S. Department of Justice.

With regard to my marital status and my children, the foremost area that Mr. Lucey appears to have exploited, I have never claimed that "Uncle Sam hides my family" or stated that FBI and CIA agents deliberately isolated me from my wife and children; nor have I claimed that the Agency used the promise of reuniting me with my family as part of the incentive for accepting the assignment in the GDR. My accusations in this respect centered around my children and they were leveled at the State Department as the result of a promise made to me shortly after my release from the GDR. Since returning to the United States last spring a reliable source has informed me that my wife was granted a final decree of divorce at some period during my imprisonment in the USA and although I have never been served with a copy of the decree or other notification of divorce (or notice of a divorce hearing) I see no cause to dispute the advisement.

Lastly, concerning the aspersions cast on my sanity, at this writing permit me to say only that I have never in my life been certified psychotic by any U.S. medical authority or adjudicated mentally-incompetent in a court of law, notwithstanding the conflicting legal and medical opinions as to my mental condition on the day of my arrest in Texas, over six years ago.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case - #264170

REF: State Dept. Airgram No. A-903 from Berlin - Subject: Psychiatrist's Report on Richard Case NAGELL, U. S. Citizen Released by GDR

Reference airgram furnishes background information on Subject and fills in gaps in the chronology of events in Subject's life of interest to the Agency. Of particular note is the fact that Subject was acquitted on 29 April 1968 after his claim of temporary insanity at the time of the crime found support in the expert testimony of a noted American neurologist, Dr. Edwin WEINSTEIN. An article in the January 1968 issue of RAMPARTS by William W. TURNER implied that NAGELL had been involved in the assassination plot against President KENNEDY and that he had been "salted away". Subject denied any involvement in any conspiracy and denied that he had any information of use to GARRISON. Subject alleged that his fear that the CIA might try to "eliminate" him was planted in his mind by Mr. GARRISON. (See page 2 of interview report). On page 3 of the interview report Subject states he no longer believes that it is realistic to think that the CIA was trying to kill him.

George R. BABINEAU, Cpt., MC, the psychiatrist at the U. S. Army Hospital, Berlin who interviewed Subject, was granted a continuing liaison clearance on 17 October 1968 at the request of DDP/E/G/IS.

Dr. Edwin A. WEINSTEIN was security approved as a continuing contact through SECRET for the Medical Staff on 13 July 1965. WEINSTEIN is with the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D. C.

Ricey S. NEW, Jr. NAGELL's attorney who was present during the interview, is with the Washington, D. C. law firm of NEW, MACKEY and GEORGE. Newspaper clippings from the WASHINGTON STAR for 17 March 1966 and the NEW YORK TIMES for 29 August 1965 reflect that NICEY has been associated with East Berlin attorney, Wolfgang VOGEL and West Berlin attorney, Juergen STANGE, in a number of cases involving the release of Americans from East Germany. According to an FBI report dated 3 February 1967 these releases usually involved the payment of specified sums of money and VOGEL and STANGE were allegedly reaping large monetary benefits for their services.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Garrison and the Kennedy Assassination:
Richard Case Nagell (201-746537)

1. Subject was born 5 August 1930 at Greenwich, New York
   City, N. Y. He is a U. S. citizen with passport J 543069.

2. Subject is not associated with CIA and has not been so associated.

3. He entered the U.S. Army on 5 August 1948, his eighteenth birthday. His military career was distinguished. He was awarded many military decorations for his service in Korea. He was never AWOL or court-martialled.

4. On 28 November 1954 Subject was one of six men in a B-25 which crashed near Friendship Airport. Nagell was the sole survivor. The plane was not found for 11 1/2 hours. Nagell suffered severe injury to the head and facial disfigurement. He was honorably discharged from the Army on 20 October 1959 with the rank of captain. In December 1959 he was employed as a special investigator by the Department of Alcoholic Control, State of California. He was dismissed from this position in June 1962. In July 1962 he was shot in the chest but refused to provide the police with further information. In August 1962 he went to Mexico City. In September and again in October 1962 he appeared at the American Embassy in Mexico City. He asked for help in collecting money from the State of California. He claimed that he had been approached for espionage recruitment while in Mexico City but refused to provide any particulars. He said that he wanted to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He left Mexico City on 28 October 1962. On 16 November and 15 December 1962 he was in touch with the FBI in New York City and Jacksonville, Florida. During the latter meeting he said that he had been approached in Washington, D. C., by someone whom he considered to be working for the Soviets.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

5. In December 1962 and January 1963 Nagell was examined at the VA hospital at Bay Pines, Florida. The diagnosis was "chronic brain syndrome associated with brain trauma with behavioral reaction characterized by passive aggressive and paranoid features." (An FBI memorandum of 12 June 1964 noted that Nagell was considered mentally disturbed by his mother, his brother, an ex-wife, and a friend. The mother, who said that she had been under psychiatric care for several years, described Subject's brother, Louis, es an almost hopeless alcoholic.)

6. On 20 September 1963 Subject was arrested in El Paso, Texas, on the charge of having tried to rob the State National Bank. A cell mate concluded from Subject's remarks that he had become a Communist Party member after his discharge from the army, that he had attempted suicide three times after his arrest, and that he had made arrangements with the CP in Los Angeles to pick up his passport in El Paso so that he could go to Czechoslovakia.

7. In a letter of 6 January 1964 Nagell advised the FBI in El Paso that in September of 1963 he had been instructed by an agent of a foreign government to comply with an agreement made in May 1963 to participate in a criminal offense against the U.8. or be exposed to the FBI. It was this threat, said Nagell, that led him to try to hold up the bank. The reference appears to be to the assassination of President Kennedy. At any rate, sometime after the assassination Nagell claimed that he had known both Oswald and his wife. Pictures of Nagell were shown to Marina Oswald on 18 January 1964. She said that she did not know him.

8. At the time of his arrest Subject had in his possession a notebook which made reference to "Medical Aid to Cuba", the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee," the names of six persons alleged to be CIA agents, and other information. The FBI informed the Office of Security on 12 March 1964 that at the time of arrest Nagell also had a list of six names, marked CIA. The names were F. Parker, Mrs. Guthries, C. Churchill, J. Sloss, E. Leibacher, and J. Davanon. It was later determined that Richard Fecteau also appeared on this list, where he was marked as "Lynn, Mass.", and "DAC (CIA)".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 45

a. Our records show that Richard G. Fecteau was aboard an American plane shot down over Manchuria in November 1952 and that he is serving in Peiping a twenty year sentence on spy charges. Fecteau, an OPC employee, was quoted in the press as saying that he worked for CIA.

b. F. Parker was not identified. He may possibly be John Floyd Parker, an Agency employee in 1964 who was in Japan in 1952.

c. There is no pertinent identifiable information about Mrs. Inu Guthries. She may be Frances Agnes Guthrie, an Agency employee in 1964.

d. C. Churchill was not identified. He may be Creighton Churchill, who was in Japan in 1952.

e. J. Sloss may be John Richard Sloss, an Agency employee in 1964.

f. E. Leibacher could be identical with Ernst Leibacker who in 1964 was in the Los Angeles field office of the DCS.

g. J. Davanon may refer to Joseph Frances Davanon, also in the Los Angeles field office at the time.

9. John Floyd Parker, Frances Guthrie, Ernst Leibacker, Joseph Frances Davanon, and John Richard Sloss all stated to the best of their knowledge they had never met Nagell. It is possible, however, that Nagell knew or knew of Parker, Churchill, and Guthrie through their work in the Far East. As for Leibacker and Davanon, Nagell lived in Los Angeles in 1962.

10. On 16 April 1964 Nagell sent to the FBI a letter claiming that in September 1963 he had sent to the Bureau a registered letter signed "Jack Kramer". The 1964 letter implied that the 1963 letter had warned the FBI about the impending assassination. The FBI, of course, did not receive such a letter.

11. In January 1968 William T. Turner stated in an article in Ramparts, "The Garrison Commission on the Assassination of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

President Kennedy", p. 56, that Nagell was then still confined
at Leavenworth, that he had been a highly decorated infantry captain
in the Korean War, and that he claimed to have become a CIA agent
thereafter. *Ramparts* shifted the plane crash in which Nagell was
injured from 1954 and Maryland to 1957 and Cambodia. The article
repeated the allegation that he staged a phony holdup in order to be
under arrest when the assassination occurred.

12. On 6 June 1968 the American Consulate in Zurich cabled
    Washington to say that Richard Case Nagell, passport J 543069, had
    appeared at the consulate on 4 June and had said that he was working
    for a secret U.S. Government agency on a mission to Geneva, where
    he was to meet some Japanese. He asked for money. He returned to
    the consulate the next day, was incoherent, and seemed psychotic. He
    claimed that on 14-16 May 1968 he had been interviewed by District
    Attorney Jim Garrison. He said that Garrison had warned him that he
    was in danger of being killed and that he wanted to inform CIA that he
    was in Zurich.

13. On 7 September 1968 another William Turner piece was
    printed by *Ramparts* under the heading "/ Assassinations / Epstein's
    Garrison". It referred to Nagell as a former U.S. intelligence agent
    and repeated much the same story that it had told in January. Turner
    and Ramparts may have been unaware that Nagell was out of jail by then.

14. On 25 October 1968 the *Washington Post* reported that after
    holding Nagell for four months, the East Germans had released him
    on 23 October at an East-West Berlin crossing-point. Nagell left.by
    plane for the U.S. on 25 October. "Informed sources" said that Nagell
    was taken off a train en route through East Germany to Berlin because
    he made some remarks which the East Germans considered derogatory.

15. On 31 October 1968 State forwarded the text of a report by a
    U. S. Army psychiatrist who examined Nagell on 23 October. Nagell
    said that he was on active duty with the army from 1948 to 1959 and that
    from 1953 to 1959 he was an officer in military intelligence. He also
    provided accurate information about the 1954 plane crash and its results --
    among them, in his own words, his "unstable personality and immature
    or impulsive behaviour". He said that he draws 64% disability pay. He
    lost his job in California because one night in 1962, while drunk, he tried
    to break down the door of the apartment of his estranged wife.

After his confused attempt in 1963 to rob the El Paso bank, he
spent 4 1/2 years in prison. He was examined by Dr. Edwin Weinstein,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 47

a noted American neurologist, who found his electroencephalograms abnormal, and as a result he was released from prison on 29 April 1968.

Nagell said that because of the Ramparts article of January 1968 he was paid a visit by Jim Garrison. He told Garrison that he had no Information of any use to him. The interview left him, however, with two fears: that Garrison might try to subpoena him and that CIA might try to "eliminate" him. (By the time he was providing this information in Berlin Nagell was well aware that he was not involved in any conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.) He said that his fear of CIA was planted in his mind by Mr. Garrison.

After his release he went to New York, where a sister lives. Не was almost hit by a car driven without lights and decided to go to Europe to escape being killed by CIA. In June he appeared in Zurich. He next set out for West Berlin but was taken off the train on 11 June 1968. For several months he was repeatedly asked to admit that he was a spy. Eventually he concluded that the only way to obtain his release was to pretend that he was mentally ill. He did so, was examined by a psychiatrist, and was released.

"He no longer believes that it is realistic to think that the CIA was trying to kill him." He termed himself "chronically paranoid". The Army psychiatrist concluded "Currently he is not psychotic and seems competent in a legal and psychiatric sense . . . ."

Nagell's final remark was, "Well, I'll tell you one thing, that's the last time I ever take a train through East Germany."

REF:

1.  State Telegrams No. 258355 to U. S. Mission Berlin dtd 19 Oct 1968 and No. 2538 from Berlin dtd 22 Oct 1968

2.  Clipping from WASHINGTON POST dtd 25 Oct 1968

Subject is one of the characters in the GARRISON case. See summary dtd 18 January 1968 in his file. He was arrested for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September 1963 and sentenced to Leavenworth penitentiary. In June 1968 CIA received a cable from Bern in which NAGELL was quoted as telling the CONGEN he wanted them to "inform CIA he in Zurich".

The details of how and why NAGELL is in Europe, in particular East Berlin, are missing. State Telegram No. 2538 from Berlin states that the charges are still unknown. "Basic documents -- are still in hand of State Security authorities."

Subject was released by East German authorities together with one Leon Burris JAMES. An intensive review of JAMES' file (#266602) failed to reveal any connection between JAMES and Subject. State Department reported both cases simultaneously because JAMES and Subject are currently in the same situation in East Berlin. JAMES is also mentally unstable and has cause embarrassment abroad for the State Department since 1964. He was of Agency interest in 1965 because he had in his possession while in Switzerland the names of two Agency employees who were in a covert status. It was never determined how JAMES obtained these names.

WASHINGTON POST Oct 1968

BERLIN, Oct. 24 (AP)—East Germany has released a former U.S. Army captain it held for four months. No specific charges were brought against him, the sources added.

He was reported in general good condition on his release.

Informed sources said Richard Case Nagell 28, was delivered at a border-crossing point between East and West Berlin yesterday in the presence of East Berlin attorney Wolfgang Vogel; attorney Ricey S. New of Washington and an official from the U.S. Mission in West Berlin.

A U.S. spokesman said Nagell left by plane today for the United States. Nagell was described as a Californian and a former U.S. Army captain who left the service in 1959. In 1954, he was the sole survivor of an airplane crash near Friendship Airport that killed five servicemen.

Informed sources said Nagell was taken off a train by the East Germans four months ago while he was on his way from West Germany to West Berlin through East Germany.

Apparently he made some remarks which the East Germans considered derogatory, the sources said.

Arrangements for Nagell's release were handled by Vogel, New, West Berlin attorney Juergen Stange and various government officials, the sources reported.

The U.S. Mission had not disclosed that Nagell was being held

# [Assassinations]

## SIRHAN'S MOTIVES

Unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan has lived to tell of his motivations-but he has chosen to remain silent. The only other potential source of information is his family, which had not spoken to the press. Mahmoud Abdel-Hadl, an Egyptian correspondent for Akhbar Elyoum in Cairo, recently gained access to Sirhan's family. Based upon information supplied him by the family, he has written exclusively for RAMPARTS the following account of Sirhan's motivations and the strategy he plans for his trial.

Because of the forthcoming trial and the difficulty of dealing with this subject without emotional involvement, the editors of RAMPARTS have elected to present this information of historic interest to our readers without display, and in as objective a form as possible.

BECAUSE I AM AN ARAB I was able to break through the barrier of suspicion that had stopped other journalists cold and obtain the first in-depth interviews the Sirhan family has given since the assassination. From their comments and from what Sirhan has said to them, a picture of the man and his motives begins to emerge, replacing the misleading portraits which haveswamped the U.S. press.

The fact that Sirhan has not publicly discussed his trial is no accident. It is his own strategy, something he developed after thinking about it for long hours in his specially made jail cell. In fact, he has confided to his family that he will never make any statement unless special provisions are made for the courtroom proceedings. What Sirhan wants is, quite simply, publicity. He wants the major television networks to be allowed to broadcast the entire trial. If they do this, he says, he will tell all. "And if they refuse?" his brother Adel recently asked him. "Then I shall go to the gas chamber -silent," Sirhan replied.

To understand why Sirhan is indeed capable of such an act, one must understand that he es fiest and foremost an Arab, bon un Palestine and consumed with interest in the Middle Eastern con-thet. He is deeply committed to making his trial a public and political forum for the Arab position.

College educated, articulate and a voracious reader, Sirhan is confident about his own ability to cope with his predicament. His eldest brother, Shereif, told me that Sirhan studies the intricacies of his case as many as ten hours a day in his cell. Shereif recalls that Sirhan recently said to him, "I do not need a lawyer. I understand my case and know how to defend myself." But even so, Attorney Russell Parsons is defending his client, and doing it on Sirhan's own grounds. "The main issue," Parsons told me, "is to answer this question: why, for what reason, did Sirhan kill Robert Kennedy? There are 100 witnesses who saw Sirhan shooting Mr. Kennedy, but no one seems to know why he did it."

Sirhan and his attorney hope that the defense-presuming that the television networks are allowed into the courtroom-will show that Sirhan did not have "malice aforethought" in shooting Kennedy because the act was a political gesture, and that Kennedy, to Sirhan at least, was merely a symbol. His brother Adel notes that "if Sirhan was just an assassin, he could have done it in another way, just by having a gun with a telescope. He went to the Ambassador Hotel expecting to get caught; that is why he left his notes at home. I believe that Sirhan wanted to get caught so that he could say what he believes."

WHEN I FIRST TRIED to meet with the Sirhan family, I was refused. Security is extremely heavy around them, and they are understandably wary of new faces. Later, when I finally obtained an invitation to meet with them, Mrs. Sirhan apologized, I believe for having been inhospitable to a fellow Arab.

This family, which fled Jordan to seek greater safety and security than it had known, is now living in terror. They are somewhat at a loss to understand the events which have suddenly catapulted them into history. None of the four brothers goes to his job; they all feel that death follows them everywhere, and they move carefully, with a heavy guard. "Why don't you just leave this country?" I asked Shereif. "Where shall we go?" he answered. "To whom shall we leave our brother? Our land is under Israel's occupation." Shereif clarified his statement: "Our brother is in jail; we have to stay."

I sensed not only the Sirhans' confusion, but also some bitterness. They have not received any aid from the Arab countries, as they originally thought they might. Parsons is also somewhat surprised; he had hoped that the various local Arab consulates would help defray court costs,

Indeed, Los Angeles' Jordanian consul, who visited Sirhan in jail at Sirhan's request, indicated to me that the accused assassin had expected the Arab people to treat him as a hero. However, except for some Palestinian extremists, his act has been universally repudiated by the Arab world. One Arab newspaper haş said editorially, "We don't feel any responsibility for this. It is the society that fed him with hostility, the society that gave him the gun, that is responsible." Members of the Arab Students' Association, of which Sirhan was once an officer, feel that the killing of Kennedy was a terrible mistake. One of them said to me, "What are we going to do with the rest of the American candidates? Kill them all because they want to help Israel?"

Still, the Sirhans' friends are primarily Arab, and they live in an atmosphere that is more Arab than American. The entire family spent a good deal of time discussing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The mother says that Sirhan was the most sensitive and the most involved during these discussions. Adel says that Sirhan once saw a television report of Robert Kennedy addressing the members of the Neveh Shalom Temple in Portland, Oregon. While in the synagogue, Kennedy, wearing a yarmulke, declared that the United States must help Israel against aggression from whatever source.

"Unlike the South Vietnamese," Kennedy said, "the Israelis have shown they are willing to fight for their own survival. Indeed, Israel is the very opposite of Vietnam: the Israeli government is very democratic, effective and free of corruption. Its people are united in its support." The senator then urged the Johnson Administration to proceed at once with the sale of 50 Phantom jet lighters to the Isrnell Air Force and to cut off economic aid to the Arab countries. This whole episode made Sirhan very angry, Shereif recalls. "He left the room putting his hands on his ears and almost weeping."

Continued from page 6

I asked Sirhan's mother why she thought her son had shot Kennedy. "Everything in this country was helping Sirhan," she maintained. "It was pushing him to the danger point. Everything, the propaganda of the Zionists, everything, was against his country, against his people."

Adel described Sirhan's current state of mind: "He feels he has done a terrible thing, but he feels now it is too late to be sorry. Now he wants Americans to listen to something they have never listened to."

And at their first meeting in the jail, Sirhan's mother said to him, "Shame on you. Why have you done such a thing?" He replied, "It's too late to speak of it.. But all the Americans will know why."

EPSTEIN'S GARRISON

TWO SUMMERS AGO a tandem attack on the Warren Report all but relegated that work to the fiction section of your local library. The first was Mark Lane's *Rush to Judgment*, which convincingly demonstrated-using the Warren Commission's own evidence-that Oswald could not have done it alone, and drew the first dim outlines of the conspiracy theory. The second was. Edward Jay Epstein's *Inquest*, which exposed the rather shoddy inner workings of the Commission and laid bare the tortured logic it finally employed to dispel notions of a conspiracy.

Both books became best sellers, but their authors have since gone different ways. Laane, who shuttered his law practice and struggled for years to get his manuscript published in the United States (it was first published in Britain), has stumped the country in support of District Attorney Jim Garrison's theory that the assassination was carried out by an anti-Castro paramilitary team supervised by persons with CIA affiliations, Epstein, whose book was a converted Cornell University master's thesis-the subject was urged upon him by his mentor, Andrew Hacker-has emerged as one of Garrison's most fervid accusers. His vehicle is *The New Yorker*: in the issue of July 13, he delivered a 25,000-word blast at Garrison, calling the DA's investigation a fraud.

The *New Yorker* article had its genesis over a year ago, when the author showed up at Garrison's office in New Orleans. According to Chief Investigator Louis Ivon, Epstein spent about 48 hours in town, some three hours at the office, and hasn't been seen since. Much of what he writes about has occurred since this touch-and-go visit and is obviously hearsay on his part, yet he writes with the authoritative tone of a participant. Undoubtedly this technique is convincing to his audience, which assumedly is unfamiliar with the intricacies of Garrison's investigation. But to those familiar with the facts, the article is badly slanted.

For example, Philosophy Professor Richard. Popkin of the University of California at San Diego, author of the book *The Second Oswald* (propounding the theory of an Oswald double) and "Garrison's Case" in *The New York Review of Books* (September 14, 1967), recently commented on the article:

"I found it a queer mix of facts, half-facts, rumors and very dubious information from people hostile to Garrison. Epstein has compressed all this to make it look like everything's on the same level. I think it would take an awful lot of work to disentangle what he's saying on almost any page as to how much of it has a factual base, how much of it is rumor that he has heard from people, how much of it are charges that have been made by people like [William] Gurvich [who volunteered to work on the investigation without pay, passed himself off as the Chief Investigator, then turned on Garrison] against Garrison, which haven't been substantiated anywhere except by Gurvich's statement of them. And also that he tends to take facts and information and rumors and so on, that occurred over a year and a half's period, and compress them all into simultaneous events, so that a statement made by Garrison at one time is pounced upon on the basis of information or statements he made a year and a half later in a totally different context."

So 1 think it's a quite unfair presentation, which has some factual base, but which also has a lot of very dubious elements in it."

One of the dubious elements is Epstein's version of the testimony of Dean Andrews Jr., a colorful attorney who numbers among his former clients Oswald (who wanted his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps rectified) and the late David William Ferrie, a central figure in the Garrison investigation. The day after the assassination, Andrews told the Commission he received a phone call from a man he knew as Clay Bertrand, whom he described as a "lawyer without a briefcase" for local homosexuals. Bertrand asked him to go to Dallas and defend Oswald. Garrison contends Bertrand is Clay Shaw, whom he has charged with conspiracy.

According to Epstein, Andrews initially gave the FBI "several different descriptions" of Bertrand, and finally admitted that Bertrand "was merely a figment of his imagination." Later, before the Commission, Andrews stated that he had recently seen Bertrand in a bar and, Epstein says, described him as "a boy" who was "five feet eight inches" and had "sandy hair." "No other clues to Bertrand's identity turned up, however," writes Epstein, "and Wesley J. Liebeler, a Commission lawyer who conducted the investigation in this arca, said he was convinced that no such person existed."

An objective reading of Andrews' testimony, however, reveals that he told the FBI that Bertrand was "approximately six feet one inch to six feet two inches in height, brown hair, and well dressed"-a description that closely matches the tall, aristocratic Shaw. As for Bertrand being a figment of his imagination, Andrews declared, "That's what the Feebees [FBI) put on." He recounted that G-men had pestered him to the point where he told them, "Write what you want, that I am nuts. I don't care." As for his later remark to the Commission's Mr. Liebeler that Bertrand was only five feet, eight inches, Andrews explained that "this time I was looking for the fellow, he was sitting down." Nowhere does he refer to Bertrand as a "boy." Epstein was perhaps confused by his exclamation: "I don't play Boy Scout and measure them."
In his superficial examination of Gur-

Continued from page 8
rison's case, Epstein evidently failed to check the police records prepared upon Shaw's arrest. Thoroughly shaken by the arrest. Shaw blurted out, according to Patrolman Aloysius Habighorst, that he had used the alias "Clay Bertrand." The alias was duly entered on the fingerprint card and booking sheet.

One of the most fascinating characters in the conspiracy drama is Richard Case Nagell, a former U.S. Intelligence agent who claims he encountered Oswald in Mexico City in 1963, and had been instructed by his spy superiors to determine if the rumors of an assassination attempt had any foundation. Nagell says he learned that the first attempt against Kennedy was scheduled for September 26 in Washington, D.C., and that Oswald (who crossed the border into Mexico the day before) was to be set up as the "patsy" and shot in front of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. When the anti-Castro paramilitary team could not penetrate the Presidential security in Washington, Oswald got a reprieve. But Nagell, who says he was sure the attempt would come off but failed to get the FBI to listen, faked a bank robbery in El Paso on September 20 so that he would be arrested and in federal custody when the assassination occurred.

Epstein dismisses Nagell as being mentally unbalanced, noting that "court records indicated that Nagell had suffered brain damage in an airplane crash in 1957" and that, following the bank episode, he was "an inmate of a federal institution for the criminally insane in Springfield, Missouri." As he does so frequently throughout the article, Epstein delivers a version which if developed fully would throw a different light on the matter. Nagell was in a plane crash, but he was given Intelligence training after his recovery, indicating that he had no permanent brain injury. Moreover, the fact that he stood trial implies that he was legally sane. Recently, he was released from Leavenworth Penitentiary-he had been at Springfield only temporarily.

The publication of the Epstein article came at an opportune time for Clay Shaw. Obtaining advance copies, his attorneys entered it as evidence before a three-judge federal panel which was hearing arguments that the DA was "conducting aren of terror" and "persecuting" the defendant. Apparently the panel was unimpressed, for it unanimously rejected the defense's argument and ordered the case to trial.

If Garrison does get his day in court--a day Epstein has struggled to deny him -chances are his case will hold up better than The New Yorker's brief for the defense.

The President, on the eve of his abdication, arranged to accept the resignation of the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court in order to replace him with the President's former lawyer, then an associate justice;

As a parlay, the President submitted to the Senate the name of his oldest hand-holding crony to fill the vacancy created by the promotion of his former lawyer:

The chief justice, who had written a famous report designed to satisfy the people that the assassination of the President's predecessor was sans conspiracy and the sole act of a demented mind, conditioned his resignation on the Senate's approval of the appointments;

The President's ex-lawyer, when called to testify before a Senate committee, conceded that during his three years on the high court he had continued to act as the President's advisor;

That pursuant to this role, he had sat in on numerous cabinet-level meetings, but that he had merely "summarized" the views of others for the benefit of the President;

That as a justice he had dressed down a prominent businessman who had criticized war spending, though whether his call was made at the President's request he could not say and remain faithful to the Separation of Powers;

That the businessman had retracted his statement, though in the end it proved to be accurate;

That the justice could not answer questions concerning his judicial opinions since the Constitution specifies that members of Congress may not be questioned about their acts in any place other than in Congress;

That despite this asserted Constitutional bar, the justice pointed to his dissenting vote against extending the one-man-one-vote principle to local government as proof of his devotion to State's rights;

That although he had been at the President's disposal as advisor-summarizer, he had never been involved in discussions that could conceivably reach the Court;

That the issues under discussion at the top-level meetings had ranged from the Vietnam War to riots in the cities;

That the justice had voted to jail draft card burners and had voted against taking up for consideration the legality of the war;

That he voted to give the police sweeping rights to stop-and-frisk suspects on suspicion alone;

That within two months of his proposed elevation he had authored a booklet, "Concerning Dissent and Disobedience," which limited the moral right to disobey laws to those "basically offensive to fundamental values of life or the Constitution" and held that even in such cases no legal defense could be urged, but jailing must be willingly accepted;

That shortly after that book was published, the justice denounced, in a rare interview from Washington, the activities of some of the Columbia University protestors as "totally inexcusable, from the point of even primitive morality";

That during his first term on the Court, he cast the deciding vote upholding the conviction and five-year sentence of Ralph Ginzburg for "pandering" a non-obscene magazine;

That during each of his three terms he nearly always voted for business interests and against efforts to cut down the trusts:

That throughout his years on the Court he was widely rumored to have been one of the President's most hawkish advisors on the Vietnam War.

Consider the revolt on the left if anything like this happened in 1968.

REF: IN Cable 25955 dtd 6 June 1968 from [Zurich]

OUT Cable 06625 dtd 7 June 1968 to [Zurich]

Reference cables concern the claim of an individual appearing at the Consul General's office in Zurich, Switzerland on 4 June 1968 that he is one Richard Case NAGELL. NAGELL was sentenced to a 10 year term for bank robbery on 9 June 1964 and is supposedly in a federal prison in Missouri.

GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness in his investigation according to a news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January 1968. The clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached. This file also contains a copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 prepared in research on the GARRISON CASE.

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to ascertain from the FBI if Subject is still in prison.

I did not receive reference IN Cable 25955 initially. Attached is a copy I obtained from OS Cable Desk. However, the original copy was routed to SRS and it is possible some one else on the Staff is already handling the matter.

18 January 1968

SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case

## ALLEGATION:

Richard Case NAGELL, "a highly decorated infantry Captain in the Korean War", alleges that he became a CIA agent. He said he fired the gun in the bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination of President KENNEDY took place. NAGELL charged that "the FBI illegally seized from him evidence crucial to his defense, such as notebooks containing the names of certain CIA employees, photographs, two Mexican tourist cards (one in the name of Joseph KRAMER, the other in the name of Albert HIDEL) and receipts for registered mail, including the one for the letter sent HOOVER warning of the assassination. NAGELL claimed he was instructed to "arrow" the patsy, that is kill him (OSWALD) after the assassination. He contended he got cold feet and this was his reason for the attempted bank robbery, he would rather be arrested than commit murder and treason. The article alleges that while it was suggested in court that an airplane crash NAGELL survived mentally affected him, he was given intelligence training after the crash. Also, NAGELL complains he has been salted away because of what he knows.

## CIA CONNECTION:

None; although, Subject was of interest to OS in 1964 and early 1965 because of information furnished to the Agency by the FBI that he had in his possession the names of six CIA employees at the time of his arrest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September 1963.

SOURCE:

1968 RAMPARTS
Article by Willian
W. TURNER

## OS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject became of interest to the Office of Security in March 1964 when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at the time of his arrest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September 1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these names in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted by evidence. Ho could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington, D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October 1962. His file contains mostly FRI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints stemming from the plane crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965 made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL be personally interviewed by a representative of 05 in the hope that NAGELL might reveal how he came into the possession these names but no further action is indicated in his file and this interview was not undertaken.

## DETAILS:

Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964 when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested for bank robbery.

The RAMPARTS claim that he received intelligence training after the plane crash is true. The crash occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holebird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He served in Korea and Japan as a member of the V. S. Army Counterintelligence Corps, terminating about 1958. A Lt. Col. Bed W. OLEAN who served with NAGELL personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane crash.

The RAMPARTS article's claim that NAGELL said he fired the gun in the bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on 1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (ses page 4 of chronology)

The RAMPARTS article's allegation that the FBI took from NAGELL a note- book containing the names of CIA employees is true.

HAGELL's complaint that he was "salted away is open to speculation. A ten year prison sentence does appear harsh, considering the documented brain

# Garrison Case-

# Can We Afford

# Not to Listen?

BY JACK MABLEY

THE INVESTIGATION INTO the assassination of President Kennedy is being reopened. It is being conducted by a prosecutor with the power of subpena and a grand jury with the power to indict.

It would be better for the country if the federal government were making the investigation rather than a New Orleans official who has been accused of being unstable and of seeking headlines.

However, the federal government shows no signs of wanting to reopen the matter, and the prosecutor, Jim Garrison, appears to be quite insistent on carrying it thru.

![JIM GARRISON photo]

A number of writers and self-appointed investigators also are dissatisfied with conflicting facts and unanswered questions, and they continue to publish evidence to rebut the Warren commission conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald alone was involved in the assassination.

ONE OF THE MOST persistent critics of the Warren conclusion is Ramparts magazine. This is a liberal, no, a radical publication which represents the viewpoint of a small minority. However, it has done some effective investigative reporting, particularly in exposing the CIA infiltration into college activities.

Ramparts assigned an investigator, William W. Turner, who they say is a former FBI agent, to spend 9 months looking into the New Orleans evidence.

"I have worked closely with the D. A. [Garrison] and his staff," Turner reports. "In my opinion, there is no question that they have uncovered a conspiracy."

The gist of the New Orleans case is that Oswald was Involved with a heterogeneous group of adventurers, anti-Castro Cubans, and radical righters who included members of the Minutemen and American Nazis.

Their common cause was to encourage or mount a revolt in Cuba against Castro. They also were strongly anti-Communist.

There is no question this group existed. Garrison has evidence that Oswald was part of it. Garrison's investigators have evidence that Oswald's pro-Russian leanings actually were a front, or a disguise to conceal his real role as an communist.

GARRISON BELIEVES THAT Osvald was schooled in covert operations by the CIA while in the marine corps at Atsugi naval station in Japan. Supporting evidence is Oswald's proficiency in the Russian language, the source of which was never explained, the ease with which he entered Russia, and the lack of censure by the government on his return, or by the marine corps in his discharge.

In effect, Garrison feels Oswald was either a CIA agent or was involved with CIA activities.

The New Orleans group was angry at President Kennedy because of the failure of the Bay of Pigs operation and because they thought Kennedy wasn't sufficiently anti-communist:

Garrison has dozens of witnesses he will subpena to fit bits and pieces into the puzzle, Individually, many can be dismissed as unreliable, but collectively they raise many questions that an objective observer would like to see resolved.

It certainly is within the power of the federal government to disprove every one of these witnesses' stories, if they can be disproved, Presumably, the federal government does not want to dignify Garrison's allegations with formal denials.

IF THERE IS ANY substance to Garrison's charges, two powerful agencies of the federal government stand to be discredited. Garrison has interviewed one witness, Richard Cass Nagell, a highly decorated Korean war veteran who claims to have been a CIA agent, who says he sent a registered letter to J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the assassination plot: If this is true, Hoover and the FBI would be guilty of dreadful dereliction of duty.

The CIA and CIA fronts are deeply involved in the activities of the men Garrison believes plotted the President's murder..

Turner, the Ramparts investigator, believes powerful government agencies are doing everything in their power to discredit Garrison.

Ten persons involved in the case have died, most of them violently, since the assassination. All went to their graves with information Garrison considers pertinent to his investigation.

Unless Garrison is killed or removed from office in some way, it is difficult to see what can stop him from airing these stories, probably in a court of law that the public may judge their validity.

NAGELL, Richard Case

Reference is made to your memorandum of April 25, 1969 concerning your request to locate Mrs. Mitsuko Takahasi NAGELL, the wife of Subject.

Efforts by the SY Los Angeles Field Office to locate Mitsuko Takahashi NAGELL, aka Mrs. Richard Case NAGELL, aka Mitsuko TAKAHASHI, met with negative results.

Attached for your information and retention is a copy of an SY memorandum dated September 2, 1969 which indicates that an individual identified only as R.C. NAGELL placed an advertisement in the *East Village Other*, a New York underground newspaper, which makes obscene reference to both the Central Intelligence Agency and SY.

# Memorandum

TO : Director, O/SY

Thru: Chief, O/SY/

FROM : L.G.Marcell, O/SY/

DATE: September 2, 1969

SUBJECT: Item in East Village Other, August 20, 1969

This past weekend, I visited a friend who had just returned from New York City, bringing back a copy of a New York underground newspaper, the *East Village Other*, dated August 20, 1969.

Out of curiosity, I paged through the paper and, on page 17, found a so-called classified section, consisting generally of ads for male and female artists models and offerings of books alleged to instruct one in the art of synthesizing hallucinogenics.

In the personal columns of this section, the following was noted, a verbatim transcript of which is set forth:

"Caught In The Act. Notice to the CIA and all SY
Eshitheads who participated in Project Purple Shaft:
After that fiasco in the GIR you worms did your best
to screw, blue and tattoo me. You even tried to have
my ass dusted in Berlin . . . you fuckups. Now its
my turn to do a little shafting.

Cordially, R. C. NAGELL."

Card indices in SY/E reflect no indication that anyone named R. C. NAGELL or any variation thereof, including NAGLE or NOGELL, has ever been granted clearance in this office.

A check in SY files reflected a record on Richard Case NAGELL, born August 5, 1930, who apprently is identical with the individual who authored the above item. A cursory review of the file reflects that NAGELL has been of interest to both the FBI and the Department in recent years.

While NAGELL may be something of a crackpot, the item does appear to contain somewhat of an implied threat. For this reason, the information is forwarded for your consideration and for any action which may be considered necessary.

# Background

My initial contact with Mr. Nagell was when he was expelled from the DDR by the East German officials who forcibly propelled him toward us over the borderline into West Berlin. As we initially escorted Mr. Nagell back to US Army Hospital Berlin in the US Mission vehicle, he seemed unsure of where he was, and who we were, as well as being angry and belligerent about his treatment by the East Germans. In the course of the two hour interview which was then conducted at the hospital, Mr. Nagell gradually regained his composure and gave a more cooperative and coherent history. At his insistance, the interview took place in the presence of the attorney Mr. Ricey S. New, Jr., who acted in an unofficial capacity as a legally oriented "friend."

The salient aspects of Mr. Nagell's history are as follows. He says he was on active military duty (Army) from 1948 until 1959. For the first three of these years he was an enlisted man, and for the last six he was an officer, working in military intelligence. In 1954 he was the sole survivor in a plane crash which resulted in a brain concussion, numerous physical injuries, and prolonged military hospitalization. Mr. Nagell now claims that he believes it was this head injury which resulted in his "unstable personality and immature or impulsive behaviour." lle attributes to this instability his marital difficulties and his decision to resign his commission in 1959, something which he now considers unwise. At the time of his leaving the service he was not awarded a disability pension, but he says that he was later able to successfully petition the VA for a "64% disability." He claims that he had never seen a psychiatrist during his military career.

From 1959 to 1962 he says that he worked for the State of California as an investigator for various bureaus. His marital difficulties had increased and his wife insisted on separation, keeping with her their two children. Hagell says that one night in 1962 he became intoxicated, and tried to break down the door to her apartment. On this basis he says he lost his job and says that for the next year the "just drifted," apparently without motivation to worl., supporting himself on his disability pension and financial aid from his sister. lle is not certain about whether or not the divorce from his wife has ever been legally completed.

## LINIT DISTRIBUTION

In September 1963 he was accused of committing an act which he now says was bred out of his feeling of hopelessness and desperation. He claims that in a confused way he attempted while armed to rob a bank and was easily apprehended. For the next 4 1/2 years followed a complicated series of trials, appeals and retrials. In addition to spending these years in prison, he also had at least three prison hospitalizations for psychiatric observation. His appeals apparently hinged on his contention that he was "temporarily insane" at the time of the crime. He was not considered insane at any time during his imprisonment, and his claim to temporary insanity found support in the expert testimony of a noted American neurologist, Dr. Edwin Weinstein. Dr. Weinstein apparently interpreted Nagell's EEG's (electro-encephalograms) as being abnormal and argued that Nagell had developed a "paranoid personality, and instability" on the basis of his brain injury. This contention was apparently disputed by other expert witnesses, but in any case Nagell was officially acquitted on April 29 of this year.

Nagell says he then went to the New York area, where his sister (his closest relative) resides, but he claims an additional complication in his life had risen in that he had once been an "acquaintance" of Lee liarvey Oswald, and had been implicated in a possible plot to assassinate President Kennedy in an article in *RAMPARTS* magazine which appeared in January 1968. Mr. Nagell firmly denies that he was involved in any way with any such conspiracy, and was in fact imprisoned at the time of the assassination. On the basis of this magazine article Nagell says that Mr. Garrison, the attorney general from New Orleans who is arguing that a conspiracy existed in the assassination, came up to New York to interview him. Nagell says that he denied that he had any information of use to Mr. Garrison, but that the interview left him with two fears. One fear was that Garrison might subpoena him to testify in the New Orleans proceedings, and the other fear was that the CIA might try to "eliminate" him, a suspicion which he says was planted in his mind by Mr. Garrison. He says that soon afterwards while walking down a street at night in New York City he was almost run over by a car without lights. He interpreted this as being an attempt at murder by the CIA and in some haste left the country for a tour of Europe.

In June, shortly thereafter, he discussed with an American consular official in Zurich his recurrent fear that the CIA was going to "hit" him. His next travel point was to West Berlin, and on June 11, 1968, while his train was traversing the DDR, he says that he was taken off the train and illegally detained. He is not certain why he was taken off the train but admits to having talked freely on the train to other passengers about his life history, and he was also carrying with him a heavy portfolio of all of his Army and government records involved with his service career, disability, and imprisonment. For several months Nagell claims that he was interrogated by the Last Germans and repeatedly asked to confess his role as a spy or government agent. Eventually, Nagell says that he concluded the only way to be released would be to feign mental illness, which he says he proceeded to do. This was several weeks ago and he says he was soon examined by an East German psychiatrist and events were set in motion which culminated in his release today, four and one-half months after his detention began.

Mr. Nagell's plans for the future center around returning to the United States and beginning an appeal to the government to grant him a psychiatric disability pension, as well as for his physical disability, on the basis of his head injury. He no longer believes that it is realistic to think that the CIA was trying to kill him.

### Mental Status Exam

Mr. Nagell is a tall, 38 year old male who shows the evidence of a prior head injury in the form of extensive scars on the left side of his face, facial asymmetry due to seventh nerve injury, reconstructive surgery on his left ear, etc. In addition he shows some healed incisions on his left wrist which he claims were superficial lacerations self-inflictei at the time of his first imprisonment in 1963, and again a few weeks ago in the DDR. He denies that in either instance he seriously intended to kill himself. He is of superior intelligence and shows a remarkable memory for dates and names. Initially he was belligerent, angry, and suspicious of every effort made to help him. Over the span of two hours, he gradually became more cooperative and rational. He is in his own terms a "chronically paranoid person" by which he means that he is always highly suspicious and tends to impute intentions where none may exist. Despite his


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 82

LIMIT DISTRIBUTION

overall suspiciousness, and his fears about the CIA, there was no overt evidence of psychosis. His nutritional state and general well-being both appeared to be good.

Summary

In summary then we seem to be dealing with a person who has had a personality disorder for a number of years, manifested by emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, a tendency to be litigious, and a general suspicious or paranoić orientation. It is difficult to know how much of what he is saying is factual, but it may be that in June of this year he was becoming "borderline" or even delusional in his thinking about possible attempts on his life, and this probably explains his flight to Europe. Currently, he is not psychotic and seems competent in a legal and psychiatric sense to negotiate his own affairs and be a free citizen again.

His own closing words provide a lighter note to what other- wise has been a complicated and serious mishap. "Well, I'll tell you one thing, that's the last time I ever take a train through East Germany!"

John Richard SLOSS
#34490

GIST: SLOSS, a staff employee since 1948, has recently been repolygraphed with inconclusive results, having reacted to questions regarding disclosure of classified information, association with a communist sympathizer, and homosexuality. He has also been involved with cooperation in an extramarital affair which *eliminated* in a black-mail attempt on one of the parties. His name is perhaps identical with a name among six names of Agency employees found on a mentally disturbed and disaffected former CIC intelligence officer who alleges contact with Russian and Cuban Intelligence agents. Details of these questionable areas in regard to SLOSS are set forth below. Recommend intensive and thorough investigation of SLOSS including surveillance of activities.

DETAILS: 1. Mr. John Richard SLOSS, born 24 September 1919 at Cleveland, Ohio, has been a staff employee of this Agency since 1948. His parents are American born. He graduated from Yale University in 1941 and was assigned to Military Intelligence Training Center, Camp Ritchie, Maryland, as an instructor, from January 1943 to July 1945. He attended Columbia University, School of International Affairs and the Russian Institute from 1946 to 1948, receiving an M. A. Degree in International Affairs.

2. SLOSS is currently a Special Intelligence Duty Officer in OCI, GS-14. During his assignment in Germany 1953-1955 and on a TDY to Germany in 1958, he had been authorized to deal with foreign intelligence elements in the OCI overseas liaison program. SLOSS was polygraphed in 1950 and 1953 with favorable results; in 1955 with unfavorable results; and twice in 1964 with inconclusive results regarding giving CIA documents or classified information to unauthorized persons, contact with a possible communist sympathizer, and engaging in homosexual activities since working for CIA. He was granted a "Q" Clearance in October 1963. His Top Secret Clearance was certified to the White House on 23

SECRET ![GROUP 1 Excluded from automatic downgrading and declassification]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 90

SECRET

February 1965 in connection with a visit to a Presidential relocation site.

3. The name of John SLOSS may be identical with the name J. SLOSS found on the person of Richard Case NAGELL when arrested in connection with a bank robbery in El Paso, Texas, on 20 September 1963. A notebook found on NAGELL made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the addresses of Foreign Embassies, the names of purported CIA agents and other information. Although NAGELL is unquestionably mentally unbalanced, he tells a story of being involved in espionage which is not fully contradicted by evidence. There is no apparent explanation of why the name J. SLOSS as well as five other names of CIA personnel should have been in the possession of Richard Case NAGELL. The weird story of NAGELL is contained in a chronological listing of his activities appended to this memorandum.

4. A review of the Security file on SLOSS in connection with the Richard Case NAGELL matter revealed that SLOSS, for the past few years, 1960-1964, had provided his apartment as a place of assignation in the adulterous relationship of Philip Barry KENNEDY, a GS-15 Intelligence office, assigned to OCI and Mrs. Betty BARKER, a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency from 19 October 1953 until 26 July 1962. The relationship between [Kennedy] and [Barker] was disclosed on 19 May 1964 when KENNEDY reported to the Office of Security that Mrs. [BARKER] had received a strange telephone call from an unknown male on 18 May 1964 who advised her that he knew what was going on between her and her boyfriend and that he had pictures. The unknown caller attempted to blackmail Mrs. BARKER into meeting him. Mrs. [BARKER] apparently told her husband the whole story and informed [KENNEDY].

5. It is noteworthy in the SLOSS-KENNEDY-BARKER matter that SLOSS has been involved in cooperating in an unlawful and immoral activity which, according to the direct testimony of one of the parties, (believed to be true because the report was against her own interest) resulted in a blackmail attempt against her in May 1964.

6. Of particular concern should be the results of the latest two polygraph examinations, the validity of which, because of medication including a tranquilizer type drug and alcohol in the Subject's system, was deemed to be inconclusive.

7. During the 1955 polygraph examination, the Subject admitted to homosexual desires but stated that these had never caused a personal problem and had never resulted in his participation in a homosexual act. During the 24 April 1964 examination, the Subject showed consistent reactions to the homosexual question which indicated deception. During

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 91

further specific questioning on 22 May 1964 covering the various homosexual
areas however, there were no strong reactions to indicate that Subject might
be practicing deception on the specific question regarding engaging in homo-
sexual activities since working for CIA.

8. In connection with the phase of questions concerning contact
   with any possible communist sympathizer, the Subject reflected overall
   disturbance indicating that all the questions obviously bothered him and
   that deception was being practiced within that phase. The polygraph opera-
   tor noted that there were outstanding reactions to the following two questions:

20 b "Other than your comments about FISHER, during your
undergraduate period at Yale did you have any contact
with any Communist or Communist sympathizer?

Answer: No."

20 e During your CIA employment, have you had any contact
with any Communist or Communist sympathizer?

Answer: No."

9. It is particularly noteworthy that during his examination on
   22 May 1964 when asked nine questions as to whether he had been acquaint-
   ed with certain individuals, Subject only reacted when he answered "no"
   to having been acquainted with Jerry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTON. These
   names had been submitted to Subject based upon pure conjecture that there
   possibly might have been some connection with these individuals at Camp
   Ritchie Military Intelligence Training Center. Since the fact that both
   Jerry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTON have cooperated with Soviet Intelligence
   should have been unknown to SLOSS and he declared he is not acquainted
   with them, there should have been no reason for him to react to these names.
   The polygraph operator states that SLOSS was not pressed further regarding
   FISHER (whom he had characterized as "left of center") or his own possible
   knowledge of SEVERN or WOLSTON since it was obvious that SLOSS was
   beginning to feel harassed on this matter and stated that he did not enjoy
   being asked these questions.

10. During SLOSS' interview on 4 April 1964, SLOSS reflected
    consistent reactions on the questions:

"Since working for CIA, have you given CIA documents or
classified information to unauthorized persons?"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 92

# SECRET

"Have you ever deliberately given classified information on documents to any unauthorized person?"

In explanation, Subject said he was bothered by this idea, but that he had no knowledge of any particular situation wherein he had divulged information to anyone who was unauthorized to receive it or who would have used it against the Agency's interest. On the test administered on 22 May 1964 to resolve any possible compromise to communist or foreign intelligence organizations, it was determined that there were no significant reactions to relevant questions in this area.

11. It should be especially noted that the polygraph operator, during the 4 April 1964 interview, detected an odd smell on Subject's breath and noted his flushed face, frequent silly grins and lethargic movements, suggesting that the Subject may have been slightly intoxicated. The operator did not ask during this interview whether the Subject had taken any drug or alcohol prior to the interview but recalled an incident wherein the Subject when arrested for drunken driving in 1963 had produced evidence that he was a diabetic and had taken medication prior to the incident. Consequently, during the second interview on 22 May 1964, Subject was questioned regarding his physical health. He replied that he had stopped taking medication for diabetes in November 1963. He explained that he took three or four diuretic pille. He specifically denied that he had taken any other drug, narcotic or alcohol. When this question was asked during interrogation, he reflected reaction indicative of deception and then admitted that for breakfast he had taken one glass of vodka with some orange juice. He stated that he drank vodka for breakfast sometimes whenever he was tense or nervous over anything.

12. The polygraph operator in his report concluded that the "validity of final test charts is held in question and there is no strong evidence that the specific areas of concern have been conclusively resolved at this time. It is recommended that a further study be conducted on this case and that information resulting from such a study be sent to IRD for possible reinterview of the Subject and polygraph resolution".

13. SLOSS has indicated reactions indicative of deception during the polygraph examinations. In one specific question where these reactions were present, he admitted to lying. This was in the question as to whether or not he had taken any alcohol prior to the examination.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

# CONCLUSION:

1. SLOSS has lied in his most recent polygraph examination and has evidenced indications of deception in areas concerning divulging classified information to unauthorized individuals, association with a communist sympathizer and homosexual inclinations. SLOSS' reaction to the names of Jerry SEVERN and lya WOLSTON has not been fully explored. The polygraph operator has recommended further investigation and a repolygraph because the recent tests are inconclusive.

2. SLOSS has been involved in an immoral and illegal extra-marital activity between a Staff employee and a former Staff employee where one of the parties was subjected to a blackmail attempt.

3. The name J. SLOSS (possibly identical to Subject) appeared on a list of CIA employees found on the person of a self-designated "dis-affected American" arrested by the FBI for bank robbery in September 1963. This individual (mentally disturbed) with previous intelligence experience has declared that he was approached by Soviet Intelligence while and/or after he was in Mexico City in September 1962.

4. It is suggested that the extent of the adverse security implications concerning SLOSS is such, that if SLOSS is ever found to be a security risk, the failure at this time to pursue an aggressive investigation of all his contacts and activities to resolve all areas of doubt could possibly lead to a conclusion that we have been remiss in our duties. The undersigned recommends the following action:

a. That physical and technical surveillance of at least two weeks duration be made of SLOSS to determine his contacts and activities after working hours.

b. That current seven way National Agency Checks be made on SLOSS.

c. That Richard B. FISHER, a friend of SLOSS', characterized by him as having been involved in radical and left of center ideas while en undergraduate at Yale,be fully identified, his present location be ascertained and the degree of his association with LOSS be determined by a personal interview with FISHER.

d. That Richard Case NAGELL be personally interviewed by the undersigned in the hope that by a sympathetic approach he may reveal how he came into the possession of the name J. SLOSS and other employees of CIA.

e. That police and credit checks be made on SLOSS in the Washington, D. C. areas Baltimore, Maryland; New York City; Cleveland, Ohio: Chicago and El Paso, Texas.

f. That listed references, Charles L. VENABLE, Philip B. KENNEDY and Richard LEHMAN previously interviewed in September 1963 in connection with a "Q" Clearance of SLOSS, be reinterviewed by the undersigned with intensive emphasis on SLOSS' activities and acquaintances outside of working hours.

g. That SLOSS be repolygraphed with unrelenting pressure on previously unresolved matters.

Date 3/9/68

Eleanore_Gambert was contacted at her home located at 82-25 Grand Avenue, Queens, New York, on February 28, 1964, by Special Agents Thomas J. Dowling and Benjamin P. Grogan, who identified themselves to her as Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She was told that the Special Agents wished to talk to her about her brother, Richard Case Nagell; that she would not have to speak with the interviewing agents, that anything she might say could be used in court; and that she had a right to counsel before making any statement. Nrs. Gambert advised that she had no objection to being interviewed and that she would cooperate in any way possible.

She advised that her brother, Richard Case Nagell, last resided with her in her home for a 5 or 6 week period which ended just prior to Christmas, 1962. While in New York, he was for the most part unemployed and seeking a position. She noted that he did obtain a position as a store detective but that this lasted for only several days when he decided that this was not the type of investigative work he wanted to do.

When questioned as to whether or not she knew of any activity on the part of her brother which could have been of a subversive nature, she stated that she knew of no such activity; that she did not believe her brother capable of taking part in such activity; and that if she ever became aware that he was engaging at any time in such activity she would have nothing to do with him.. At this point she noted that approximately a month prior to the interview she had received several letters that were returned to her from El Paso, Texas, which she had written to her brother, indicating that he was no longer at the El Paso County Jail. She subsequently received a letter from her brother indicating that he was at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri. She noted that she answered this letter immediately, but has not as yet heard from her

brother. She stated that she expected to hear from her
brother immediately after he received her letter and the
fact that she has not heard has made her uneasy. She
noted that she offered, if permitted, to visit him, and
that she hoped to ascertain as a result of this visit,
the reason he attempted to rob a bank in El Paso, Texas,
on September 20, 1963. She advised that she has had no
reason to believe that her brother is not responsible for
his actions, and she noted that in one letter he wrote
to her that the bank robbery attempt was a pre-meditated
action on his part. She advised that her brother has
been in a depressed state of mind ever since he had been
accused of taking a bribe and fired from his position
with the California State Liquor Authority. She noted
that she believed, as her brother claims, that this
purported bribe was set up to remove her brother from his
position with the California State Liquor Authority
because of his honesty and failure to handle investigations
as insturcted by superiors.

When questioned as to whether or not her brother,
Richard Case Nagell, maintains any type of property at her
residence, she advised that he does maintain a military
type metal foot locker, and that he has maintained it at
her residence since his discharge from the United
States Army. She noted that as this foob locker is
her brother's property, she is not aware of its contents,
although she believes it contains mementoes of his
military service, including his medals and a complete
uniform. She advised that she does not even know whether or
not the foot locker is open or locked.

It is noted that during the course of the inter-
view of Eleanore Gambert, her husband, Louis Gambert
was present.

# DETAILS: AT EL PASO, TEXAS:

Investigation in this matter is based on statements made by the subject subsequent to his arrest in El Paso, Texas, on September 20, 1963, on a bank robbery charge. Subject hinted that he might have been attempting to go to Cuba and that he really did not have the intention of robbing the State National Bank but committed the act due to the direction he had taken toward going to Cuba. A notebook which the subject had on his person when arrested made reference to Medical Aid to Cuba, Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the names of purported CIA Agents and other Information.

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times" newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned "What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961, reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961, Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied toward the cost of the afore-mentioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby influence FPCC policy. However, during the past year this source observed there has been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC so that today their influence is negligible.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

EP 65-951

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the National Headquarters of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799 Broadway, New York City. According to this source, the position of National Office Director was created in the fall of 1962 and was filled by VINCENT "TED" LEE who now formulates FPCC policy. This source observed LEE has followed a course of entertaining and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations including the CP and the SWP when he has felt it would be to his personal benefit as well as the FPCC'S However, LEE has indicated to this source he has no intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization. LEE feels the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States and support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without interference from other nations, but not support the Cuban revolution per se.

The CP and the SWP have been designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

CHRONOLOGICAL RECORD OF SUBJECT'S BACKGROUND

The subject was depressed and expressed the wish that he had died in the crash. Subject had facial disfigurement as a result of the crash. The subject was suspicious of questions asked him. When subject was examined on April 8, 1955, the hostility had disappeared and his suspicions mad been lessened. His responses at that time were regarded as normal.

July 30, 1962

On July 30, 1962, the subject advised Special Agents, of the Los Angeles Office of the FBI that he was residing at 4037 Leeward Avenue, Los Angeles, California, and that he was on suspension from the Alcoholic and Beverage Control (ABC), State of California. He stated that on April 1, 1961, he transferred from the Department of Employment to the ABC and had been employed since that time as a Special Agent, until his suspension on June 8, 1962.

NAGELL stated that on May 30, 1962, he and his wife had a domestic argument and, as a result of this, the police were called and he was arrested for being drunk. NAGELL claims he was not drunk and that the Los Angeles Police Department was "rousting him." NAGELL was able to make bond the same night and the next morning went to Internal Affairs, Los Angeles Police Department, because he was mad at the previous night's treatment and made some general complaints to them about Los Angeles Police personnel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

EP 65-951

and making allegations to the Los Angeles Police Department, which he later stated were not true.

NAGELL stated that he is presently unemployed, awaiting a hearing on his suspension. He stated that he hopes to be reinstated so he can clear his name and then he will resign his position. NAGELL advised that on the evening of July 16, 1962, he was returning from Oxnard, California. He noticed an automobile on two occasions behind him, and at about 8:00 PM stopped his car on the highway near Malibu, California. Two men from the car jumped into his car. They were dressed in business suits, and he thought at first they were police officers. One of the men asked him where his gun was, and he told the man it was locked in the glove compartment. He gave this man the key to his 'glove compartment, and while the man was opening the compartment, NAGELL took his gun from his waist. The man struggled with NAGELL for the gun and four shots were fired, one hitting NAGELL in the chest. The man said that if NAGELL had not grabbed for the gun he would not have been shot.

NAGELL advised that these men drove him to a medical center in Malibu, California, and left him. NAGELL stated that he then drove himself back to Los Angeles, California, and ended up at the Veterans Hospital Sawtell California NAGELL stated that he is sure now that the men were not police officers. He stated that he does not know who shot him or why he was shot.

As a result of the shooting, detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department came to the hospital to question him. He stated that he did not like their attitude and refused to tell them any details. The investigating officers impounded his 1957 Ford and also took all of his personal belongings he had with him at the time, including his driver's license, Social Security card, and Selective Service Registration. NAGELL stated that on July 25, 1962, he received a money order from a relative, and because he had no identification was unable to cash it He advised that he has a quick temper.and that this situation made him "hot under the collar."

complaining that his civil rights had been violated in hopes that the FBI would contact the Los Angeles Police and facilitate the return of his property. Later, on the same day of July 25, 1962, the Police Department did return all of his property except the automobile, which was returned on July 26, 1962.

Mr. NAGELL stated that in retrospect he believes that the Police Department did have a right to take the above items in line with their investigation. He stated that if it would be possible, he would like to rescind his original complaint. Mr. NAGELL declined to furnish a signed statement.

The following article appeared in the Santa Monica Outlook of July 18, 1962:

"Police Probe Mystery Shooting of Detective

"West Los Angeles police today are investigating the strange shooting of RICHARD C. NAGELL, 32, former investigative officer for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.

"NAGELL, in satisfactory condition in Veterans' Hospital in West Los Angeles with a bullet wound in the chest, isn't talking,according to police.

"Officer JIM MAXWELL said he received a call Monday from NAGELL asking that the California Central Investigative and Identification Bureau be notified that he had been shot Then NAGELL hung up.

"A few moments later, a second call came in from a witness who said that a man suffering from a bullet wound had driven up to him and asked for directions to a hospital.

"At the Veterans' Hospital, officers found:

"Powder burns and a hole in NAGELL's shirt

"A .32-caliber bullet embedded in the back of the driver's seat of NAGELL'S car.

"Detectives are continuing to investigate all possibilities of the case."

September 28, 1962 and October 1, 1962

On September 28, 1962, the subject appeared of his own volition at the American Embassy, Mexico City, Mexico, and volunteered the following information:

The card also reflected that he established his identification by exhibiting United States Passport Number C526729.

He related that he had formerly been employed by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control of the State of California as a Special Investigator. He stated that as a result of his investigation of some large cafes and bars in the Los Angeles area, one of which he named as the Mauna Loa, and some controversy which he had had with

EP 65-951

officers of the Los Angeles Police Department during the course of his investigations, he had been suspended on June 8, 1962, and later, on June 22, 1962, had been dismissed.

He mentioned that on July 15, 1962, "while making a meet" between Malibu and Oxnard, he had been shot in the chest. In connection with this latter incident, he exhibited a brief newspaper clipping which mentioned that he had refused completely to identify his assailants or furnish information which would assist the police in identifying and locating the person or persons involved.

He stated further that on August 6, 1962, he had withdrawn his request for a hearing so that he could get the money which he alleged was due him from the State of California, consisting of $800.00 retirement contributions and $300.00 for unused accumulated leave.

He stated that he felt he had been "let down" by the United States Government, both in the United States and during the time he had been in Mexico. He stated that representatives of the United States Government could have assisted him in obtaining his money from the State of California, but were only interested in soliciting from him information concerning hoodlums and other lawless elements, for the giving of which information he "could get his head blown off." He stated that he felt he had been let down by the United States Government in Mexico because nothing had been done by the Embassy in regard to his requests to have it assist him in collecting this money, which he alleged was due him from the Stateof California. He said that he himself had sent letters to California asking for payment of this money.

By way of further background, he claimed to have served in the United States Army from August 5, 1948, (then 18 years old) until October 29, 1959, and had held the rank of Captain between the ages of 22 and 29. He stated that he had received an honorable discharge and had been wounded

three times in the Korean War. He stated that he made the major mistake of his life when he did not re-enlist and continue in the Army. Besides combat duty in the Infantry, he worked as an Investigator in the Counter Intelligence Corps.

He mentioned that he spoke Japanese fluently and had been married to a Japanese woman, who he said was divorcing him in California. He also complained in this connection that the California Courts had awarded the custody of their children to her.

He stated that he thought he had been approached here in Mexico City for recruiting, but although asked specifically in this regard, refused to state by whom or for what or on behalf of what country. He stated that one job of this sort would be in New York. He volunteered in so many words that he fully realized that what he was saying could be used against him in any court or prosecution. He stated that he had almost made up his mind definitely that he would leave Mexico, but that he would not go back to the United States. He stated that he did not care to return to the United States. He stated that so far he had "done nothing inimical to the United States." He stated that he was completely "disaffected," and that he knew the full significance of that term. He also stated that he was "bitter, disgusted, disillusioned and disaffected." One thing, he said, that he could say was that if he did go to some other country, it would cost the United States millions. He stated that he was "through being a good citizen" and thought he had gotten a "dirty deal all around."

He was told to go to the Protection Section in regard to any problems in Mexico as an American citizen. He stated that he had been to the Protection Section and would not go there again, and that the way he was feeling, he would not go back to the United States. He said that he had nothing to go back for, and that his dismissal record would prevent him from getting a good job anywhere in the United States. He mentioned that the only job he had ever worked at was that of an investigator.

He also mentioned that the Veterans Affairs Attache in the American Embassy had his military record in connection with a request he had previously made to attend Mexico City College on the G.T. Bill, but to do that he would have to enroll first and pay tuition himself which he could not do in view of his financial straits.

He stated at first that he was behind in his hotel bill, but later indicated that he had been keeping his hotel charges paid. He also mentioned that he had previously obtained a small loan from the American Benevolent Society, which he had since repaid.

In regard to finances, he stated that he was receiving $150.00 disability pension a month because of wounds received in the Korean hostilities during which he was wounded three times

He stated that he had come to the Embassy to state his side in case something should happen and was told that the statements he was making would be made a matter of record with the Embassy. He was advised not to do anything he might regret, to which he replied, "What have 1 to lose?"
He stated that unless he received the $1,100.00 soon, that the State of California owed him, he was going to some other country, and that it would not be the United States, but he refused to say what for or what the country might be even through specifically questioned as to whether he had in mind Russia or Cuba. He said he wanted to have the Embassy know how he felt, but added, "I'm not going to lay my head down on the chopping block."

It was noted that he was very tense, nervous, agitated and antagonistic throughout this interview.

On October 1, 1962, this same individual reappeared at the American Embassy and wanted to know what had been done in regard to his case. When asked what he meant by this, he stated he meant in regard to getting the State of California to pay him the money due him. He was told that at his

13. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 115

EP 65-951

request he had been permitted to make statements on the
previous occasion for the purpose of having those statements
made of record with the Embassy and he was assured that this
was being done. However, he was told that for any assistance
in regard to his financial situation in Mexico, he should
contact the Protection and Welfare Section to see if that
section could be of any assistance. At first he stated he
would not visit the Protection Section again, but on leaving
he stated he was going there and also asked what section
of the Embassy he should contact to renounce his United
States citizenship.

A short time later on October 1, 1962, he did
contact the Protection and Welfare Section, where he was
advised that the section could not intercede for him
in the collection of his alleged debt from the State of
California.

Shortly thereafter, he appeared in the Passport
and Citizenship Section, where he refused to give his name
but asked what the penalty would be for going to an Iron
Curtain country and what effect it would have on his citizen-
ship. He was advised that such an action would be a violation
of Federal law.

NAGELL also on October 1, 1962, appeared in the
Office of Veterans Affairs, American Embassy, Mexico City,
and stated that he was withdrawing his request for G.I.
educational benefits as a Korean veteran.

A short time later on October 1, 1962, he left
with the Embassy a copy of his letter of August 7, 1962,
to the State of California Personnel Board, which for
the purpose of further background, is set out in its
entirety as follows:

"August 7, 1962

"I hereby withdraw my appeal of the punitive action taken against me for dismissal by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. I withdraw my request for à hearing in this matter by the State Personnel Board

"I hereby state that the sole reason for this withdrawal of my appeal and request for a hearing is because of my financial situation. Continued, and what I consider to be unjustified, postponements of my hearing have created a situation in which I cannot afford to meet my daily living expenses until August 30, 1962, the most recent date given to me as the date of my hearing. Also, I am unable to obtain employment in Los Angeles because of the stigma attached to my dismissal.

"Previously, I had hoped to remove such stigma by showing at the hearing that my dismissal was not only improper, but that the alleged reasons for my dismissal were exagerated, distorted, and untrue, and the result of vindictiveness on the part of certain senior members of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control after it came to their attention that I intended to disclose to the State Attorney General's Office adverse information pertaining to corruption within sald Department and the liquor industry here in Southern California

"I request that my retirement contributions and reimbursement for unused leave be forwarded to me at the below listed address as soon as practical.

"Yours truly,

November 16, 1962

On November 16, 1962, the subject advised Special Agents of the New York City Office of the FBI that he was

15. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

EP 65-951

a Special Investigator for the Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control (ABC), State of California, Los Angeles,
California, and had been dismissed in June, 1962, for
his failure to answer questions pertaining to allegations
he made concerning corruption within that organization.

NAGELL stated he was presently residing with his
sister, ELEANOR GAMBERT, 82-25 Grand Avenue, Elmhurst,
Queens, Long Island, New York, telephone number HA 6-6830,
and was attempting to obtain employment in the New York area.
NAGELL advised his present objective was to have the California
ARC exposed, and he was willing to furnish "court room
testimony" that would result in the prosecution of many
Los Angeles hoodlums and their attorneys, who have acted
as go-betweens in securing alcoholic beverage licenses
through payoffs.

NAGELL advised that he was shot in July, 1962, as
a result of his refusal to "lay off" the Mauna-Loa investiga-
tion; however, he declined to disclose the details concerning
the actual shooting.

NAGELL stated he had furnished some information to
the State of California investigators assigned to the
California Attorney General's Office; however, nothing was
accomplished through this.

NAGELL appeared overwrought and obsessed with a
desire to expose the ABC, and, as a result, clear his name.
He stated this situation has caused a separation between
himself and his wife and children, who are still residing in
Los Angeles.

NAGELL advised he had spoken with SA "DICK" RICHARDS
of the Los Angeles Office on three or four occasions; however,
he had given limited information to him, due to personal
circumstances at the time. He requested that apologies be
conveyed to SA RICHARDS for not "going all the way" on
revealing all he knew concerning individuals in whom SA
RICHARDS expressed an interest.

The following information was presented by NAGELL
to the interviewing Special Agent on two typewritten sheets:

EP 65-951

"As of the aforementioned date, and prior thereto, responsible authorities of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control were aware of the foregoing information. The two agents who handled special ownership investigations in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area (consisting of 3500 licensees) were OWEN J. MC CARD, a hanger-on and close friend of WILLIAM G. BONELLI, former Director of SBE, and myself. During the course of my investigations I received pressure from both MC CARD and certain superiors to fluff off on certain investigations, and to press others - depending on the licensee or who the hoodlums were in back of the business concerned. This I did not do. In my opinion this resulted directly in my dismissal from the department, regardless of what other ostensible reasons were tendered. It is a fact that I was shot as a result of one of my investigations even though it could have been avoided by myself. Certain reports of investigations which I turned in were not forwarded thru proper channels; some of them were destroyed; I was pulled off of some investigations before their completion (which were not reassigned); certain licensees were notified that I was investigating them; and I was aware of bribes boing offered in quite a few instances. Some of the attorneys who acted as go-betweens in these affairs were as follows:

November 28, 1962

On November 28, 1962, the subject contacted the
New York City Office of the FBI and advised as follows:

The subject stated that he believed that the
Superior Court of Los Angeles County did not give him a
fair chance to be heard when it granted his wife MITSUKO
NAGELL (nee TAKAHASHI) an interlocutory divorce decree on
November 19, 1962, of which he had just received notice.
NAGELL claimed that he was aware of the divorce proceedings
and, in fact, did appear during preliminary bearings and
actually entered a cross-complaint but it was his understanding

18. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 120

EP 65-951

that the actual trial would not take place until December next. He stated that he left California in August, 1962, and went to Mexico, where he remained until October 28, 1962. He claimed that his wife's attorney knew this and apparently brought the case on prematurely so that he would be deprived of his day in court

NAGELL claimed that he has written a protest to the court granting the divorce, claiming he was deprived of his right to be heard and to have a jury trial. He stated that he is consulting the Legal Aid Society and the Veterans Administration concerning this matter since his Army pension is his only current income

December 15, 1962

On December 15, 1962, the subject advised Special Agents of the FBI in Jacksonville, Florida, that he had served as a captain in the U. S. Army and had been involved in intelligence investigatiorsfor the CIC for approximately seven years He said he served in Japan for most of his period of time and married a Japanese woman named MITSUKI NAGELL from whom he is presently divorced. He advised that during 1957 and 1958 he became acquainted in Japan with one Doctor CHAKAO FUJISAWI, a professor of Political Science at Tokyo, Japan, University. He said this person was a member of the Cabinet Research Office (CRO), a rightist organization. He said this person is presently in the United States, place unknown and deems him detrimental to the safety of the internal security of the United States. He said in either 1958 or 1959 he directed an anonymous letter to the FBI in Washington, D. C. relative to the above information concerning FUJISAWI. He stated be was discharged honorably from the U. S. Army on October 29, 1959, and subsequently became employed on December 14 1959 by the State Beverage Department in Los Angeles, California He said in June, 1962, he was accused of taking a $20,000 bribe by the State Beverage Department and was released from his employment on June 8, 1962, for refusing to answer questions. He stated he talked to the FBI in Los Angeles regarding the possibility of his dismissal being a violation of his civil rights

19. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

EP 65-951

NAGELL advised that he went to Washington, D. C. where he resided until recently. He stated while in Washington, D. C. he had been approached by an individual whom he felt was either a Special Agent of the FBI or a Soviet Espionage Agent He said he met this person in a bar in Washington, D. C., located at 811 14th Street NW, Washington, D. C. He said this person talked of Domestic intelligence and also talked of giving him an intelligence assignment. He said the more he thought this matter over he was positive that this individual works for the Soviets

He said that in September, 1962, he was invited to attend a reception at the Russian Embassy. He could not identify the individual who invited him to the reception. He advised that he contacted the Central Intelligence Agency at either Langley, Virginia, or Elwood, Virginia, and used the name of JOE CRAMER or KRAMER during this.contact with CIA. He said he told them of the above information and wanted some advice as to whether to go through with such an assignment. He said he was to meet this individual who was to give him the assignment at the above-mentioned bar. on 14th Street, and in order to be recognized, he was to place three nickels on the bar in line with a dime placed directly over the middle nickel. He said the CIA told him that since this matter involved domestic rather than foreign intelligence he should refer this information to the FBI.

He stated he went to the above bar and there was contacted by the same person and was told to go to Miami, Florida, to a bar and wear a red sweater, where he would be contacted relative to an assignment.

It is to be noted that during the entire interview with NAGELL, he was noted to be in an inebriated condition and was very vague in answering questions. He was unable to identify by name any of the individuals he discussed and was also unable to furnish a physical description of any of these individuals. In addition to being slightly inebriated he also gave the impression to the interviewing agents of being mentally unbalanced.

NAGELL stated he is presently residing at the Holiday Inn, Jacksonville, Florida, and would be there for the next few days. He said he is presently driving a 1959 Ford which bears California license MYU 890. He said he has no living relatives except his former wife, who resides at 440 South Union Avenue, Los Angeles, California, and his sister, ELEANORE GAMBERT, 8225 Grand Avenue, Elmhurst, New York

NAGELL advised that he believes in connection with his contacts that he is actually working for the Soviets. He could furnish no information as to a specific assignment given him other than that he was to go to Miami and sit in a bar which he is unable to identify and wait to be contacted by a Soviet Agent. He said he spoke Japanese and Russian fluently and is well versed in the Spanish language. He said he was shot in June, 1962, but refused to discuss any of the incidents surrounding the shooting. He said his auto has several bullet holes in it. He furnished a photograph of himself.

On December 17, 1962 efforts were made to locate NAGELL for reinterview; however, it was determined that he had checked out of the motel and left no forwarding address

December 20, 1962 to January 22, 1963

On November 25, 1963, EP T-2 made available clinical records regarding the subject covering the period when the subject was a patient at the Veterans Administration Hospital, Bay Pines, Florida, from December 20, 1962, to January 22, 1963. One clinical record contained the following informa- tion

"INTERIM SUMMARY (INTERSERVICE)"

1954 with head injury and brain concussion He said he was admitted to Walter Reed Hospital for a period of approximately six months and at that time he was unconscious for approximately twenty days. This accident left him with a left facial paralysis and some difficulty in his memory. Since two weeks ago his headache is worse and he complains of it all the time. He feels more nervous and looks as though he is in real emotional distress with periods of depression.

## 2. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

Revealed a well nourished, well developed patient with periods of depression during which he cries and sometimes said that he wishes be were dead. Other times, he looks angry and anxious. He is well oriented as to time and place, but sometimes needs to look in a small booklet to remember dates or names. Sometimes during the conversation he stops and tries to remember what he wanted to tell - at that time it seems that he is not able to continue and cries.

time he looks depressed, but sometimes angry. He wrote many
letters about different subjects and some of these,it seems,
emanate from a patient who is under the effect of a depressive
feeling. The patient was transferred to Ward 22-4-S on
1-15-63.

## 5. TRANSFER DIAGNOSES AND PRESENT STATUS:

1.  Chronic brain syndrome secondary to brain concussion in 1954. Treated Unchanged.

Another clinical record made reference to the above
mentioned clinical record and stated "Paragraphs 1, 2, 3
and 4 of Interim Summary (Interservice) dated 1-15-63
remain unchanged, with the following addendum:

"4. COURSE IN HOSPITAL (Cont'd): This patient was transferred
to the open section of the Psychiatric ward after having been
seen by the Chief of the Psychiatric Service on two occasions.
At that time the Neurological Service felt that patient had
received maximum hospital benefit from their viewpoint and
because of his hostility and irritability that he should be
placed on the Psychiatric ward for further observation. He
complains frequently of not receiving the attention that he
felt he should have and that he wasn't getting the privacy
that he also thought he should have. On his initial interview
he refused to discuss why he was in the hospital, saying that
he had been through all this before. He relates that he did
not want to attend the group psychiatric conferences because
he did not want anyone to know about his private business.
He insisted 'I am entitled to a private interview if I want
one.' He was somewhat withdrawn on the ward and showed poor
inter-personal relationship. One of his chief complaints
while being on this ward was his headaches and he related that
they were getting worse. He stated 'Nothing that they give
me here is doing any good.' After several days of listening

23. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 125

EP 65-951

to his demands a better rapport was established and a private interview was given him. He seemed well oriented in all spheres. Speech was of normal flow and coherent. He showed no flight of ideas. He denied delusions or hallucinations. No suicidal or homicidal tendencies were elicited. He states that his main trouble is 'headaches which I have had continuously recently. He also complains of 'dizziness, and at times an unsteady gait. These symptoms are sometimes associated with a transient loss of memory.. During the interview his retention and recall were good. Sensorium was intact. When I asked him what he thought was wrong he said 'I think my trouble is physiologic. When I asked him what he meant by physiologic he stated 'My trouble is all due to my head injury. He felt reassured when I told him that I thought some of his symptoms were due to that mishap. Although he smoked continuously during the interview he related quite a story about his Army activities and his domestic situation, but was somewhat evasive about the trouble he was in while in California, especially the trouble involving the F.B.I. and some shooting event. He was presented before the Psychiatric stand and at first was somewhat reluctant to answer questions and when asked a question that was not due to his liking he would relate 'this is my private life.' During the Staff Conference he said 'you Psychiatrists are all stereotyped. During the Staff Conference, however, his mood was one of friendliness and not one of depression, although he will occasionally get irritable when supposedly asked a personal question. After the interview at the Staff Meeting he approached me saying 'that he did not want any of the nurses aides to know about his business and that was the reason why he refused to give out any information.' He further related that he keeps everything in a little book that he has done or said because he has a poor memory, although some of these memory deficits were not brought out in the interview with him. He was advised to stay on the ward for another week or two for further observation but he felt that he did not have to since nothing more could be done for him. He also said the reason for him wishing to leave was that he had a job in mind and was going for an interview Since his insight and judgment were unpredictable at times and although no psychotic behavior was noted, it was felt

24.

that he could leave the hospital AMA. In view of the chronic nature of his illness the future prognosis must be guarded as to a possibility of a permanent future social economic adjustment. Patient discharged 'A.M.A. on 1-22-63.

January 24, 1963

On January 24, 1963. the subject was contacted by Special Agents of the Miami, Florida, Office of the FBI at Northeast First Avenue and Fifth Street, Miami, at which time be stated that his name was JOE KRAMER. He was sitting in his 1957 Ford hardtop, black and white in color, bearing California license MYU 890.

EP 65-951

Subject was very reluctant to furnish any informa- tion but identified himself as RICHARD CASE NAGELL, a former Special Agent for the Liquor Control Office, State of California, Los Angeles Office, and a former Captain in the United States Army with experience in intelligence work with the CIC.

Subject stated he wished to be advised if he was given a pistol with a silencer and possibly some microfilm by sources - Cuban, Russian or both - from Mexico City through a Cuban in Miami - if he would be permitted to return these items to his contact so he could be of further use to the United States Government. Subject stated he did not want to cooperate fully with the United States Government or anyone else. He gave the impression that he was better at determining what the enemy is up to than the agencies regularly handling these matters, except the FBI. He stated the FBI is the only agency that has treated him well.

Subject stated within the next few days the individual with the gun would contact him and he would immediately contact the FBI, provided the gun could be returned to him in time to make the delivery to whomever he had to deliver it. When pressed for details subject was very evasive and vague.

No, promises were made to the subject and the espionage statutes and the registration act together with other laws were explained to him and he acknowledged he was fully aware of their provisions.

Subject stated he was discharged from the Liquor Control authority in California under false charges of accepting bribes. Immediately thereafter, he left for Mexico because he was disgusted with the United States. In August or September, 1962, he met a man from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to individuals whom he believed may have been soviet agents. He refused to give descriptions, names or other details. When questioned on specific points he became mysteriously evasive.

26. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 128

EP 65-951

Subject claimed he had the names of all Americans involved in activities against the United States in a safe deposit box, the key to which he gave to a close friend in the event of his death.

When subject was questioned concerning the details of possible microfilm he might deliver, he stated that maybe there would not be any microfilm, and that was a conclusion on his part that microfilm would be delivered with the pistol. He also stated he did not know what the gun would be used for but since he was not stupid he thought it might be used to kill someone with. Subject tore off the corner of a $10.00 bill and offered it to the interviewing agents to be used as identification in contacting him when he would later call the FBI for a meeting. He suggested that the corner of the $10.00 bill be shown to a bartender in a bar that he would name and then a waiter could let him know that a friend wanted to see him. The agent stated this would be unnecessary and he agreed to call the office January 25, 1963.

## ATTEMPTED BANK ROBBERY AND AFTERMATH

BUNDREN, El Paso Police Department.

EP 65-951

the fact that he had fired the two shots into the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone. He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to Cuba." This statement was not further explained. When requested to explain this statement, NAGELL refused, stating "I can see this is going to be a frame, which is to be expected in our capitalistic system."

When asked for his motive in attempting to hold up the bank, NAGELL stated that he was unhappy with the American judicial system, because he had attempted, through judicial procedures, to get to see his two children, a girl 3½ and a boy 2½, in custody of his divorced wife, and the California court had not executed an order in keeping with his request.

On September 21, 1963, a complaint was filed before United States Commissioner HENRY C. CLIFTON, El Paso, Texas, charging NAGELL with violation of Section 2113, Title 18, United States Code, in that NAGELL did on September 20, 1963, at El Paso, Texas, enter the State National Bank of El Paso, a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, organized and operated under the laws of the United States, and make a felonious attempt by force and violence and putting in fear by use of a .45 caliber revolver, one PATSY CLYDINE GORDON, an employee of the said bank to take a thing of value, to wit, Travelers Cheques, which were in the care and custody and controlled by the said bank.

In the presence of El Paso Police Department
Detective THOMAS F. MC CONNELL, JR. and his partner,
NAGELL stated that he desired to talk to Special Agents
of the FBI. He stated that he did not desire to talk
in the presence of anyone else and Detective MC CONNELL
and his partner then departed.

NAGELL started off his conversation by saying that
when he had appeared before the US Commissioner just prior
to this interview, that he had "pled not guilty" since he
did not know what else to do. He stated that he did not desire
to be represented by an attorney and that he did not care
what happened to him. He exhibited his left wrist, the inside
of which was covered with a great number of superficial
wounds to the skin. He stated that the night before while
he was in the El Paso City Jail he had used a piece of tin
in an attempt to cut his wrists. He said he had lost about
a pint of blood.

He stated that when he entered the State National
Bank of El Paso on the afternoon of September 20, 1963, that
he would not have taken any money. He said that to the
best of his recollection he had been in El Paso for
several days and had made an attempt to find a former war
buddy of his named JOSE C. IBARRA, who formerly resided at
904 South Hill Street in El Paso. He stated that he had
made inquiry at this address, but IBARRA had moved and he was
not able to find out where he had gone. He said that he had
known IBARRA in 1948 and 1949 when both of them were Sergeants
in the Army. Continuing, he advised that he had driven to
El Paso from San Diego, California. NAGELL stated that he
had not eaten in three days because he did not feel like
doing so. When asked if he desired food he stated that he was
afraid that it would make him sick if he attempted to eat.

NAGELL stated that he wanted to point out that
he had in the past received psychiatric treatment and that in
1955 he had been hospitalized at Walter Reed Army Hospital as
a result of the crash of an Air Force B-25. He advised that
he had been the sole survivor of this crash and had spent
a considerable length of time in the hospital. He advised

EP 65-951

that Doctor EDWIN A. WEINSTEIN, a civilian doctor assigned to the Neuropsychiatric Center at Walter Reed Hospital had treated him and had a considerable amount of information as to his mental condition. Continuing, he advised that he did not think that he was crazy, but that he felt that he needed psychiatric attention and advice because of the fact that he was highly emotional and at times he could not remember what he was saying or where he was for short periods. He stated that he had requested admission to the psychiatric ward at the Veterans' Hospital, Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, however, he was not granted admission and he stated that to the best of his recollection he made this request in May or June of 1963. He pointed out that all of his medical records could be obtained at the Veterans Administration Regional Office, 1380 South Sepulveda Roulevard, Los Angeles, California.

He further advised that he had been hospitalized at the Veterans' Hospital, Bay Fines, Florida, from December 20, 1962 until January, 1963, at which time he was discharged against medical advice. He stated that he had been confined in this hospital as a result of "spells" that he had been having and that he was in the hospital for observation.

NAGELL was highly emotional, was given to spells of crying, and stated that he had not been able to get his feet on the ground since his discharge from the United States Army in 1959. In this connection, he stated that his wife was a Japanese and that he had resigned his commission as a Captain in the Imited States Army since she was extremely unhappy with his being assigned to the Infantry. He said that he had resigned the commission and that after the divorce had been granted, he had not been allowed to see his two small children because he had not been able to pay the required alimony.

He stated that he had been employed by the Alcoholic and Beverage Control in California, but had lost his job in 1962. He said that he had not worked since then and actually was not able to do any kind of work because of the time he had spent in the Army. He stated that the only job that he was prepared for was that of an investigator since he had learned this as a Counter-Intelligence Corps representative

EP 65-951

of the U. S. Army. He stated that he had been shot through
the chest in 1962 in Los Angeles, California, but that the
shooting was a result of a private matter and he did not
care to discuss it further.

He stated that lately he had been too upset to
be even considered for a job and then intimated that he
had gone into the State National Bank "so that they would
take him back in the hospital." He stated that he was not in
the bank to get any money and that he fired the shots to
keep anyone from following him. He said that he had used
the names of JOE KRANE and ROBERT C. NOLAN and advised that
he had used the name of NOLAN while in the Military
Intelligence

NAGELL further advised that he had been suffering
from a headache for several days and stated that he had been
taking some kind of pills that were furnished to him by the
Veterans' Administration, but that he was out of these pills
and did not know what they were. He requested an aspirin,
which was obtained for him. In response to a question as to
whether or not he desired to see a doctor, he stated that he
did not.

In the September 21, 1963, issue of the El Paso
Times, an article appeared on page 1-A entitled "Veteran
Tries Daring Bank Robbery." The article contained a
sub-caption "Fires Two Shots As Clerk Flees From Counter."
The article states, "A 34-year-old battle-scarred Korean
war hero, armed with a .45 Colt, made a daring but unsuccessful
attempt to rob the State National Bank about 4:30 PM Friday,
firing two shots as he ran out of the crowded bank.

"Detectives and FBI Agents going through the suspect's
Suitcase found photostatic copies of numerous certificates and
commendations showing he had acquired an outstanding military
record in 11 years of service with the U. S. Army in Korea:
A photostat showed he had been honorably discharged from the
Army at Fort Dix, New Jersey, October, 1959, with the rank
of Captain.

"Other military papers found in NAGELL's suitcase
showed he had been awarded the Purple Heart three times for

younds received in battle with the enemy in Korea. Other papers also disclosed he had been awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious and outstanding service in Korea.

"Speaking to FBI Agents and other officers NAGELL admitted he had entered the Army as a buck private and was in line for promotion to major when he was given his honorable discharge. He told agents he spoke Russian, Japanese and Spanish fluently."

"His Army papers disclosed NAGELL had graduated with honors from the Army Military Intelligence School, from a special leader's course, and had served in the counter intelligence corps (CIC). He had records showing he had been given top secret security clearance on September 22, 1950."

The September 22, 1963, issue of the El Paso Times contains an article on page 1-A entitled "NAGELL Pleads Not Guilty." According to the article, "City jailers reported NAGELL has refused to eat his meals since he was booked in jail. They also reported the prisoner attempted to cut his wrists in his City Jail cell Friday night by using a tin can converted to an ash tray."

"After he was turned over to the custody of Sheriff BOB BAILEY, jailers were instructed to maintain a close watch on the prisoner and stop him from making any attempts on his life."

The September 26, 1963, issue of the El Paso Times contains an article on page 7-A entitled "NAGELL To Take Sanity Test at La Tuna." According to the article, "Former Army Captain RICHARD CASE NAGELL, 34, charged with bank robbery in an unsuccessful attempt to hold up the State National Bank, will be taken to La Tuna Correctional Institution Thursday for a sanity test."

"He will be examined by Dr. R. J. BENNETT on the motion of Assistant U. S. District Attorney FRED MORTON, who obtained an order authorizing the check up from U. S. District Judge R. E. THOMASON."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 138

EP 65-951

"MORTON said the preliminary investigation indicated that a psychiatric examination would be necessary before the government could proceed further in the case. The investigation showed that NAGELL was the sole survivor of a military plane crash, that since his discharge he had visited several FBI offices offering "highly secret" counterintelligence information, and earlier this year had been under psychiatric care in Florida for a month."

On September 27, 1963, Staff Sergeant (E-6) PHILIP J. DALY, US Army, RA 32 293 739, presently assigned to the 4th Fulisted Student Battery, School Support Command, Fort Bliss Texas, stated that he served in the same detachment in Tokyo, Japan, with RICHARD CASE NAGELL, the 441st CIC, during the spring of 1958, from approximately February to May, when he (DALY) returned to the United States. He has had no contact with NAGELL since that time.

There was only a normal acquaintance between a Captain (NAGELL) and a Master Sergeant (DALY) during this period of time.

DALY first met NAGELL on a temporary duty trip to Sendai, in northern Japan, where NAGELL had been sent to replace the Operations Officer. NAGELL stated at that time that he was being shunted into a corner.

DALY next met NAGELL about a month later in Fort Drake Tokyo.

All enlisted men of the 441st CIC Detachment thought that NAGELL was slightly unbalanced, and was not a normal officer. The reputation among the enlisted men was to stay away from NAGELL.

The November 4, 1963, issue of the El Paso Herald-Post contained an article on page l entitled "Holdup Suspect. Fires Lawyer." According to the article, "RIAMARD CASE NAGELL charged in U. S. District Court with an attempt to hold up the State National Bank told the Court today he did not attempt to hold up the bank."

EP 65-951

""I had a motive for doing what I did,' NAGELL told Federal Judge R. E. THOMASON. "But my motive was not to hold up the bank I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time.'

"NAGELL, 33, told Judge THOMASON that he is a veteran of the Korean War, that he was injured three times, and that 'I am a 64 per cent disabled veteran."

"The accused man was before the court on a petition filed by his own hand for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming he was being held prisoner illegally.

"NAGELL asked Judge THOMASON to discharge Attorney JAMES HAMMOND, who had been appointed by the court to represent NAGELL. Judge THOMASON granted the request, after telling NAGELL that Mr. HAMMOND is considered an able, conscientious member of El Paso Bar. NAGELL had refused to talk to MT. HAMMOND before the hearing opened.

"The matter of whether NAGELL, would consent to undergo psychiatric treatment was discussed, and NAGELL said he would be willing to go to La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution, and that:

'I will obey all their rules but I will not cooperate for any psychiatric examination except an examination conducted by a psychiatrist for the Veterans Administration.'

"Judge THOMASON said he would name a psychiatrist from William Beaumont Army Hospital to examine NAGELL. The Judge said he would appoint another attorney to represent NAGELL."

On November 18, 1963, the subject filed a writ of habaes corpus in the United States District Court in El Paso. NAGELL requested interview with a Special Agent of the FBI. On interview, NAGELL furnished the following signed statement:

"11/19/63

"El Paso, Texas

"I, Richard Case Nagell, do hereby make the following

38. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 140

EP 65-951

free and voluntary statement to Edward Joseph Murphy and George E. Aiken, who have identified themselves to me as Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They have advised me that the information furnished herein may be used in court. No threats, promises or force of any kind was used to get me to make this statement.

"I was born in Greenwich, N.Y. on August 5, 1930

"I was arrested on September 20, 1963, in El Paso, Texas. On September 21, 1963, I was arraigned before the United States Commissioner in El Paso, Texas, on a charge of bank robbery, at which time I entered a plea of not guilty and was bound over for indictment by the Federal Grand Jury. Bail was set at $25,000. On September 21, 1963 I was incarcerated in the El Paso County jail, where I since have been and am presently confined.

"On September 24, 1963, the United States District Court ordered that I be given a psychiatric examination to determine my mental competency to stand trial, and that if determined necessary by the examining psychiatrist, to conduct such examination, to be committed to the Federal Correctional Institution, La Tuna, Texas, for a period not exceding two weeks

"On November 4, 1963, the court nullified that part of the aforesaid order, pertaining to the committment, and re-ordered that I be committed to Beaumont Army Hospital, El Paso, Texas, for said psychiatric examination.

"On September 24, 1963 and again on November 4, 1963, the U.S. District Court ordered that further prosecutive action against me, be deferred until such time as the Court is in receipt of the results of said psychiatric examination.

"As of this date I have not received the afore- mentioned psychiatric examination nor have I been committed to either of the aforementioned institutions for such examination, nor have I been indicted by the Federal Grand Jury.

"I believe that an unnecessary and undue delay has occurred in bringing me to trial, as a result of my reluctance

39. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

EP 65-951

to participate in a psychiatric consultetion and/or examination. I believe that this is a violation of my right to a speedy trial as guaranteed to me by Amendment 6 of the Constitution.

"In relation to the foregoing statement, I believe that I, as an accused person, am not required by law to emit any statement or to answer any questions, whatsoever, to any person, whomsoever, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, or physiologist, nor that I am required by law to participate in any examination, test or activity, verbal, written or otherwise, if I do not so elect. To he coerced to do so, is a violation of my rights under Amendment 5 of the Constitution

"An attempt has been made to indirectly coerce me to incriminate myself, by a court appointed psychiatrist known to me as Doctor Bennett, in that he queried me as to my motive for committing the alleged offense and stated to me that if I did not give him such information, I was being uncooperative, and that I might have to be sent to Springfield Medical Center, if I did not cooperate with him.

I further believe that I am being coerced into taking psychiatric examination and/or consultation by the resulting undue delay in bringing me to trial.

"I have read this statement consisting of this and 3 other pages, and it is true and correct.

On November 19, 1963, Assistant United States Attorney FREDERICK J. MORTON, El Paso, advised that there is no validity to subject's allegation inasmuch as Title 18, Section 4244, U. S. Code, states that upon a motion by the United States

Attorney. the defense attorney, or upon its own motion, the court shall cause the accused to be examined as to his mental condition where it is felt that he may be presently insane or otherwise mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his own defense. Assistant U. S. Attorney MORTON advised that according to this Statute, the examination can be made with or without the consent of the accused. Assistant U. S. Attorney MORTON stated that the subject has constantly refused to cooperate with psychiatrists, and has refused to even speak to them, and that this refusal on his part has held up any possible psychiatric examination, necessitating postponing further action.

The subject, who is still incarcerated in the El Paso County Jail, sent the following note to SA THOMAS B. WHITE, JR. of the El Paso Office of the FBI, which reads as follows:

"Mr. White

"When one's actions are motivated by an ideological conviction, he cannot deviate from his pursued path simply because society may censure it as wrong. But when he becomes disillusioned with such ideology, and an existing situation so dictates, he must initiate immediate corrective action as befits circumstance and as best he knows how

"I have always acted from a principal of love for my country, and this same principle actuated my conduct of September 20th, however inappropriate or incomprehensible it may appear.

"/s/ Richard C. Nagell"

The December 10, 1963, issue of the El Paso Times contained an article on pages 1 and 3-A entitled "Says Bank Holdup Try 'Patriotic'" According to the article, NAGELL had submitted several handwritten petitions to the Judge of the United States District Court in El Paso. The article states, "In one petition, dated December 5, he wrote, 'I have

EP 65-951

always acted from a principle of love for my country and this same principle actuated my conduct on September 20, 1963, however inappropriate or incomprehensible it may appear. God and I, and also the FBI, know that I am not guilty.

"NAGELL is accused of pulling a gun on a teller at the bank When the teller fled, NAGELL, is alleged to have fired two shots into the bank ceiling.

"NAGELL had previously indicated he might submit to examination by a psychiatrist at William Beaumont General Hospital. But at the hearing it was brought out he refused to do so now.

"Judge THOMASON then overruled his motion for a writ and asked that NAGELL's case be taken before a Federal Grand Jury. Previously the judge had ordered that all prosecution be deferred until an examination report on NAGELL's mental competency was obtained.

"The judge said NAGELL's argument on the bond 'more thoroughly convinces the court you need psychiatric help.'

""When NAGELL was returned to the jail, he would not tell reporters why he entered the bank. As in the past he said he would not disclose his motive.

"FRED MORTON, Assistant U. S. District Attorney, said Monday afternoon that the case will probably be taken before a U. S. Grand Jury in January in San Antonio."

On January 3, 1964, GEORGE NORMAN STANGA was contacted and interviewed at the El Paso County Jail after he contacted the El Paso Office of the FBI and specifically requested that he be interviewed regarding RICHARD CASE NAGELL. At the time of the interview, NAGELL was incarcerated at the El Paso County Jail as a Federal prisoner for the crime of bank robbery.

42.

EP 65-951

STANGA stated that since his arrest and incarceration at the El Paso County Jail for bad checks, he has become quite friendly with RICHARD CASE NAGELL. He stated that NAGELL was a very mixed-up individual, but that he enjoyed the company of STANGA and confided in him. He went on to say that NAGELL had recently confided in him to the extent that he had told him why he attempted to hold up the State National Bank of El Paso, Texas NAGELL told STANGA that after his release from the United States Army, he drifted from job to job and became more and more mentally confused as to his political, religious, and economic allegiances. During this confused period, NAGELL apparently became a member of the Communist Party of the United States and told STANGA that he did some minor work for this organization prior to his trip to El Paso NAGELL also explained to STANGA that he divorced his wife during this period, and after making several scenes with his wife, was barred by court order from seeing his children. During this period of his life, NAGELL told STANGA that he lived in the Los Angeles, California, area.

NAGELL explained to STANGA that he came to El Paso, Texas, after making a decision that everything was against him'in Los Angeles and that he should attempt to leave the United States for a Communist country in Europe. In line with this decision to leave the United States, NAGELL made a contact with the Communist Party in Los Angeles, and arranged to meet a courier or contact man for the Party in El Paso, Texas This contact man was allegedly to have a visa and passport for NAGELL so that he might leave the United States and eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL then left the Los Angeles area and drove to El Paso, Texas. He told STANGA that during this trip, he stopped by the side of the road on at least three occasions and attempted suicide with a pistol which was in his possession. He explained to STANGA, however, that he did not have the guts to do it and just let things drift along. After arriving in El Paso, Texas, NAGELL said that he got a hotel room and again attempted suicide with the revolver. He again did not have the nerve to "pull the trigger" and decided that the best way to commit suicide would be by leaving the hotel and having a "shoot-out" with

FD 65-951

a policeman. He left the hotel room, got in his car, and proceded down the streets of El Paso looking for a policeman who looked like he would shoot it out with him. NAGELL told STANGA that he did not see a patrolman, however, and decided that he would enter the State National Bank of El Paso, and cause a big ruckus because he knew that a policeman was in the building guarding a Treasury Department money display. NAGELL entered the bank and fired two shots into a wall and then left the bank, fully expecting to be shot down by a pussing policeman: However, he escaped to his car, which was parked in an alley, and gave up peaceably when arrested by the policeman who was guarding the money display in the bank. NAGELL told STANGA that his robbery of the bank was purely a suicide attempt and that he had no intention of robbing the bank for any monetary gain.

In addition to the Communist activities mentioned above, STANGA reported that NAGELL told him of a number of rolls of microfilm which contained names, meeting places, and other activities of the Communist Party, which were in his possession. Nagell, explained that these microfilms were hidden in a gas mask (Japanese type) which was located at his sister's house in New York City. He went on to say that these micro-film are hidden in the salve container which is afixed to the gas mask.. NAGELL also explained to STANGA that he had not given this information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation because he felt they would indict him as a spy and put him in jail for life.

On January 6, 1964, the subject furnished the following signed statement:

"1/6/64
"El Paso, Texas

"I, Richard Case Nagell, do heroby make the following free and voluntary statement to Edward Joseph Murphy and Lawrence W. Gorman, who have identified themselves to me as Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They have advised me that I do not have to make any statement and

44. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

EP 65-951

that any statement that I do make may be used against me in a court of law. They have advised me that I may have an attorney if I desire. No threats, promises, force, or inducements of any kind have been used to get me to furnish this statement.

"I was born on August 5, 1930 at Greenwich, New York."

"The following statement is relative to the motive which actuated my conduct on September 20, 1963."

"In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City a representative of a foreign government proposed to me that I participate in an act; Such act being a criminal offense and inimical to the best interests of the United States. At that time I refused such proposal. In May, 1963, another representative of the same foreign government made the same proposal to me. At that time I agreed to such a proposal."

"In Sept. 1963, I was informed by an American, known to me as an agent of the same foreign government, that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned act were completed, At this time I refused the aforesaid proposal."

"Approximately one week later I was instructed by this same person to either participate as previously agreed or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Thereupon I agreed to follow the instructions of this person, although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I was arrested and am presently charged."

"I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary solution to the problem with which I was confronted."

"I am not guilty as charged"

"I have read this statement consisting of this and
two other pages, and which I have initialed, and it is true
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Witness:

"/s/ Edward Joseph Murphy, Special Agent FBI, El Paso, Texas,
1/6/64

"/s/ Lawrence W. Gorman, Special Agent FBI, El Paso, Texas
1/6/64"

On January 15, 1964, Mrs. FRANCES NAGELL, 856 South
Catalina, Los Angeles, California, telephonically advised
a Special Agent of the El Paso Office of the FBI that she
was the mother of the subject and that she had heard on
the evening before about the bank robbery charge filed
against the subject.

She stated that she last saw the subject in August,
1963, at which time subject indicated he wanted nothing to
do with his relatives and no interference with his private life
She commented that her son had had a brilliant career in
the military service up until the time of the plane crash
near Washington, D. C. following which he was unconscious
for three weeks in the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington.
Upon his recuperation from those injuries, he underwent
a complete personality change.

On January 24, 1964, the subject was arraigned
before the United States District Court in El Paso in connection
with the two-count indictment returned January 8, 1964, in
San Antonio, Texas, charging NAGELL with bank robbery.

Assistant United States Attorney FREDERICK J. MORTON filed
a motion before the U. S. District Court under Section 4244,
Title 18, United States Code, to have the subject committed
for psychiatric treatment. U. S. District Judge HOMER THORNBERRY
granted the motion and ordered the subject committed to the

EP 65-951

Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri, for a period of 30 days for the purpose of psychiatric examination. The subject advised the court that he would not cooperate with the psychiatrists at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield.

While being removed from the United States District Court House in El Paso, Texas, enroute to the El Paso County Jail on January 24, 1964, and while in the custody of the Deputy United States Marshals, the subject accused the Assistant United States Attorney of violating his constitutional rights. This accusation was a repetition of numerous accusations which the subject bad previously made against the Assistant United States Attorney, according to Assistant I. S. Attorney MORTON

On January 24, 1964, Assistant United States Attorney FREDERICK J. MORTON, El Paso, advised that he had received information on a confidential basis a short while before to the effect that there was a man incarcerated in the El Paso County Jail under a Federal charge of attempted bank robbery by the name of RICHARD CASE NAGELL who was a Communist and who was about to defect to Russia when arrested Mr. MORTON related that the story was generally that NAGELL, a retired Army Captain who served with distinction in the Korean War in combat and with CIC, became embittered with the United States and our form of government partially due to the alleged denial of visitation privileges of his children, custody over whom was awarded to his Japanese wife by California divorce decree. He allegedly turned over secret material to Soviet agents while in the Military Service. He was supposed to obtain / a passport to Russia here in El Paso from a Communist agent but was so distraught over the possibility of never again seeing his children that he considered suicide or some other drastic means of preventing his defecting that he went in a bank in El Paso, asked for $100.00 in cashier's cheques, pulled a gun which caused the teller to run, and fired two shots high into the wall and fled. At the time of his arrest, he called the policeman a "capitalistic s.o.b." and has stated that what he did was done out of "love for Country." Other than that he has made no statements concerning the bank robbery except to say that he did not

intend to take any money. He has refused to talk to a psychiatrist and fired two court appointed attorneys. His court room appearances have convinced all that he is intelligent and competent mentally but extremely confused and disturbed. He files motions and writs almost daily, which are well written and lawyer Like.

At the time of his arrest, September 20, 1963, a notebook was taken from him containing what purport to be various codes, CIA and FBI agents' names, Soviet and other Communist embassy addresses and names, and the addresses of various other people and organizations, including the Los Angeles address of the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee." NAGELL has supposedly recently received a 1963 Information Please almanac with a scrambled message. Mention is made of this in the notebook.

NAGELL is supposed to have located at the address of his sister, Mrs. ELEANORE GAMBERT, 82-25 Grand Avenue, Elmhurst 73, Long Island, New York, HA 6-6830, a trunk in which a Japanese gas mask is contained. In the salve box of this mask are supposedly 4 rolls of microfilm containing the names of various Communist Party members, agents, couriers, their activities, etc. A man by the name of FRED JOHN (BENJO) an insurance agent in California, is supposed to get these things from NAGELL's sister in the event of NAGELL's death. The sister supposedly knows nothing of the contents and is not a Communist. NAGELL recently wrote a letter to this Mr. JOHN in California mentioning the almanac bit. Mr. MORTON said he rejected an offer of a deal for information purportedly furnished by NAGELL to the FBI regarding Communists in exchange for favorable consideration made through NAGELL'S prior court appointed attorney on the basis that the information was of no value. Mr. MORTON's confidential source told him that NAGELL's prior contacts with the FBI were not revealing because they were made by him solely to determine what the FBI knew of him.

# ALLEGED CONNECTION WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD

On December 19, 1963, the subject advised Special Agents of the El Paso Office of the FBI that "for the record" he would like to say that his association with LEE HARVEY OSWALD was purely social and that he had met OSWALD in Mexico City and in Texas. NAGELL refused to comment further regarding this matter.

On January 2, 1964, the subject advised a Secret Service Agent and a Special Agent of the FBI in El Paso, Texas that he had been acquainted with MARINA, the wife of LEE HARVEY OSWALD. Subject further pointed out that OSWALD was having marital difficulties with MARINA. The subject stated that he knew "certain things" in the Fort Worth-Dallas area. He said he wanted to let the Secret Service know that someone like OSWALD was in that area, however, he knew nothing of OSWALD's intention to assassinate the President. The subject stated that the requests made by prisoners in the El Paso County Jail for interviews were at times honored and at other times they were not

The above interview was conducted with the subject in response to a request made by this subject to be interviewed by a Secret Service Agent. The Secret Service Agent was introduced to NAGELI and he attempted to interview NAGELL, however, NAGELL stated that the information he originally desired to report to the Secret Service was "too late now."

On January 23, 1964, an Agent of the United States Secret Service, El Paso, Texas, advised that an Agent of the United States Secret Service in Dallas, Texas, had displayed a photograph of the subject to Mrs. MARINA OSWALD, wife of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, on January 18, 1964. This photo- graph was taken of the subject on September 21, 1963, at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office. Mrs. MARINA OSWALD carefully


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

EP 65-951

examined the photograph and then stated that she did not
know the individual who appeared in the photograph and
had never seen him before. Mrs. OSWALD was advised of the
name and aliases of the subject and she stated that she did
not know anyone by any of those names.

On January 24, 1964, while the subject was being
removed from the United States Court House in El Paso to
the El Paso County Jail for incarceration and while in
custody of the Deputy U. S. Marshals, the subject made
wild accusations to newspaper reporters, accusing the FBI
of not attempting to prevent the assassination of President
KENNEDY and stating that the FBI had questioned him regarding
LEE HARVEY OSWALD. These statements were made by the subject
in a shouting manner on the elevator enroute to the El Paso
County Jail and within earshot of the newspaper reporters,
according to AUSA MORTON.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

24 March 1964

SUBJECT: SLOSS, John Richard
#34490

1. Subject, a GS-14 in COI, has been with the Agency and predecessor organizations since 1949. He was recently investigated under procedures of the Reinvestigation Program, and he was granted a Q clearance as of 21 October 1963.

2. On 19 March 1964, Mrs. Virginia Thomas, 00/C advised that one Richard Case Bagell (OS-HE) had been picked up in the El Paso, Texas area for bank robbery. As Bagell had in his possession a list of air names, with "CIA" written after them, the Bureau inquired as to whether Bagell might possibly be an Agency employee. Two of the individuals named were 00/C Los Angeles employees who never heard of Bagell. The other names were those of F. Farber (EPII), Mrs. Guthrie (HR), C. Churchill (OS-MR) and J. Slone.

3. On 19 March I telephonically contacted Subject and inquired as to whether he had ever heard of Bagell. He replied in the negative. When I further explained the entire situation, Subject still held with the view that he has absolutely no recollection of Bagell, although it was a curious coincidence that he had been in the El Paso area in January of this year, at which time he and his mother spent three days with an old girlhood friend of Subject's mother.

4. This memorandum is for the purpose of making my brief discussion with Subject a matter of record. It is not necessarily derogatory to him.

that the actual trial would not take place until December next. He stated that he left California in August, 1962, and went to Mexico, where he remained until October 28, 1962. He claimed that his wife's attorney knew this and apparently brought the case on prematurely so that he would be deprived of his day in court.

NAGELL claimed that he has written a protest to the court granting the divorce, claiming he was deprived of his right to be heard and to have a jury trial. He stated that he is consulting the Legal Aid Society and the Veterans Administration concerning this matter since his Army pension is his only current income.

December 15, 1962

On December 15, 1962 the subject advised Special Agents of the FBI in Jacksonville, Florida, that he had served as a captain in the U. S Army and had been involved in intelligence investigations for the CII for approximately seven years. He said he served in Japan for most of his period of time and married a Japanese woman named MITSUKI NAGELL from whom he is presently divorced. He advised that during 1957 and 1958 he became acquainted in Japan with one Doctor CHAKAO FUJISAWA, a professor of Political Science at Tokyo Japan University. He said this person was a member of the Cabinet Research Office (CRO), a rightist organization. He said this person is presently in the United States, place unknown and deems him detrimental to the safety of the internal security of the United States. He said in either 1958 or 1959 he directed an anonymous letter to the FBI in Washington D. C. relative to the above information concerning FUJISAWA. He stated he was discharged honorably from the U S. Army on October 29, 1959, and subsequently became employed on December 14, 1959 by the State Beverage Department in Los Angeles, California. He said in June, 1962, he was accused of taking a $20,000 bribe by the State Beverage Department and was released from his employment on June 8, 1962, for refusing to answer questions. He stated he talked to the FBI in Los Angeles regarding the possibility of his dismissal being a violation of his civil rights.

NAGELL advised that he went to Washington, D. C. where he resided until recently. He stated while in Washington, D. C. he had been approached by an individual whom he felt was either a Special Agent of the FBI or a Soviet Espionage Agent. He said he met this person in a GARVIN'S bar in Washington, D. C., located at 811 14th Street NW, Washington, D. C. He said this person talked of Domestic Intelligence and also talked of giving him an intelligence assignment. He said the more he thought this matter over he was positive that this individual works for the Soviets.

GRILL

He said that in September, 1962, he was invited to attend a reception at the Russian Embassy. He could not identify the individual who invited him to the reception He advised that he contacted the Central Intelligence Agency at either Langley, Virginia or Elwood. Virginia, and used the name of JOE CRAMER or KRAMER during this contact with CIA. He said he told them of the above information and wanted some advice as to whether to go through with such an assignment. He said he was to meet this individual who was to give him the assignment at the above-mentioned bar on 14th Street, and in order to be recognized, he was to place three nickels on the bar in line with a dime placed directly over the middle nickel. He said the CIA told him that since this matter involved domestic rather than foreign intelligence he should refer this information to the FBI.

He stated he went to the above bar and there was contacted by the same person and was told to go to Miami, Florida, to a bar and wear a red sweater, where he would be contacted relative to an assignment.

It is to be noted that during the entire interview with NAGELL, he was noted to be in an inebriated condition and was very vague in answering questions. He was unable to identify by name any of the individuals he discussed and was also unable to furnish a physical description of any of these andividuals. In addition to being slightly inebriated he also gave the impression to the interviewing agents of being mentally unbalanced.

NAGELL stated he is presently residing at the Holiday Inn, Jacksonville, Florida, and would be there for the next few days. He said he is presently driving a 1959 Ford which bears California license MYU 890. He said he has no living relatives except his former wife, who resides at 440 South Union Avenue, Los Angeles, California, and his sister, ELEANORE GAMBERT, 8225 Grand Avenue, Elmhurst, New York.

NAGELL advised that he believes in connection with his contacts that he is actually working for the Soviets. He could furnish no information as to a specific assignment given hin other than that he was to go to Miami and sit in a bar which he is unable to identify and wait to be contacted by a Soviet Agent. He said he spoke Japanese and Russian fluently and is well versed in the Spanish language. He said he was shot in June, 1962, but refused to discuss any of the incidents surrounding the shooting. He said his auto has several bullet holes in it. He furnished a photograph of himself.

On December 17, 1962 efforts were made to locate NAGELL for reinterview; however, it was determined that he had checked out of the motel and left no forwarding address.

December 20, 1962 to January 22, 1963

On November 25, 1963, EP T-2 made available clinical records regarding the subject covering the period when the subject was a patient at the Veterans Administration Hospital, Bay Pines, Florida, from December 20, 1962, to January 22, 1963. One clinical record contained the following information:

He also exhibited his Tourist Card Number 152067, which listed his address as 4037 Lasmar Avenue, Los Angeles, California. This card showed that it had been issued at Los Angeles of August 17, 1962, and that NAGELL had entered Mexico through Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, on August 24, 1962. The card also reflected that he established his identification by exhibiting United States Passport Number G220729.

He related that he had formerly been employed by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control of the State of California as a Special Investigator. He stated that as a result of his investigation of some large cafes and bars in the Los Angeles area, one of which he has had some major role, and some controversy which he has had with officers of the Los Angeles Police Department during the course of his investigations, he had been suspended on or about, and later, on June 22, 1962, had been terminated.

He stated that representatives of the United States Goverment could have assisted hina in obtaining his money from the State of California, but were only interested in soliciting fron him information concerning hoodlume and other lawless elements, for the giving of which information he "could get his head blown off." he stated that he felt he had been let dom by the United States Covernment in Mexico because nothing had been done by the Embassy in regard to his requests to have it assist him in collecting this money, mich he alleged van dus him from the State of California.

He stated that he thought he had been approached here in Mexico City for recruiting, but although asked specifically in this regard, refused to state by whom or for what or in behalf of what country. He stated that one job of this sort would be in New York. He volunteered in so many words that he fully realized that what he was saying could be used against him in any court or prosecution. He stated that he had almost made up his mind definitely that he would leave Mexico, but that he would not go back to the United States. He stated that he did not care to return to the United States. He stated that so far he had done nothing inimical to the United States." He stated that he was completely "disaffected," and that he knew the full significance of that term. He also stated that he was "bitter, disgusted, disillusioned and disaffected." One thing, he said, that he could say was that if he did go to some other country, it would cost the United States millions. He stated that he was "through being a good citizen" and thought he had gotten a "dirty deal all around."

He was told to go to the Protection Section in regard to any problems in Mexico as an American citizen. He stated that he had been to the Protection Section and would not go there again, and that the way he was feeling, he would not go back to the United States. He said that he had nothing to go back for, and that his dismissal record would prevent him from getting a good job anywhere in the United States. He mentioned that the only job he had ever worked at was that of an investigator.

He also mentioned that the Veterans Affairs Attache in the American Embassy had his military record in connection with a request he had previously made to attend Mexico City College on the G.I. Bill, but to do that he would have to enroll first and pay tuition himself which he could not do in view of his financial straits.

He stated at first that he was behind in his hotel bill, but later indicated that he had been keeping his hotel charges paid. He also mentioned that he had previously obtained a small loan from the American Benevolent Society, which he had since repaid.

In regard to finances, he stated that he was receiving $1,100.00 disability pension a month because of wounds received in the Korean hostilities during which he was wounded three times.

He stated that he had come to the Embassy to state his case in case something should happen and was told that the statements he was making would be made a matter of record with the Embassy. He was advised not to do anything he might regret, to which he replied, "What have I to lose?" He stated that unless he received the $1,100.00 from the State of California, he would not be going to another country, and that it would not be the United States, but he refused to say what country might be, even though specifically questioned on whether he had in mind a Russian one. He said he wanted to have the Embassy know how he feels, but added, "I'm not going to lay my head down on the chopping block."

It was noted that he was very tense, nervous, agitated and antagonistic throughout this interview.

There is not but slight physical security based on personal observation and his statements during instant interview.

On October 1, 1962, this same individual reappeared at the American Embassy and wanted to know what had been done in regard to his case. When asked what he meant by this, he stated he meant in regard to getting the State of California to pay him the money due him. He was told that at his


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 174

request, he had been permitted to make statements on the previous occasion for the purpose of having those statements made of record with the Embassy and he was assured that this was being done. However, he was told that for any assistance in regard to his financial situation in Mexico, he should contact the Protection and Welfare Section to see if that section could be of any assistance. At first he stated he would not visit the Protection Section again, but on leaving he stated he was going there and also asked what section of the Embassy he should contact to renounce his United States citizenship.

A short time later on October 1, 1962, he did contact the Protection and Welfare Section, where he was advised that the section could not intercede for him in the collection of his alleged debt from the State of California.

Shortly thereafter, he appeared in the Passport and Citizenship Section, where he refused to give his name but asked what the penalty would be for going to an Iron Curtain country and what effect it would have on his citizen- ship. He was advised that such an action would be a violation of Federal law.

MAGILL also on October 1, 1962, appeared in the Office of Veterans Affairs, American Embassy, Mexico City, and stated that he was withdrawing his request for G.I. educational benefits as a Korean veteran.

A short time later on October 1, 1962, he left with the Embassy a copy of his letter of August 7, 1962, to the State of California Personnel Board, which, for the purpose of further background, is set out in its entirety as follows:

"August 7, 1962

Gentlemen:

I hereby withdraw my appeal of the punitive action taken against me for dismissal by the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

13-00000

## Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control

I withdraw my request for a hearing in this matter by the State Personnel Board.

"I hereby state that the sole reason for this withdrawal of my appeal and request for a hearing is because of my financial situation. Continued, and what I consider to be unjustified, postponements of my hearing have created a situation in which I cannot afford to meet my daily living expenses until August 30, 1962, the most recent date given to me as the date of my hearing. Also, I am unable to obtain employment in Los Angeles because of the stigma attached to my dismissal.

"Previously, I had hoped to remove such stigma by showing at the hearing that my dismissal was not only improper, but that the alleged reasons for my dismissal were exaggerated, distorted, and untrue, and the result of vindictiveness on the part of certain senior members of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage control after it came to their attention that I intended to disclose to the State Attorney Generals office adverse information pertaining to corruption within said Department and the liquor industry here in Southern California.

"I request that my retirement contributions and reimbursement for unused leave be forwarded to me at the below listed address as soon as practical.

"Yours truly,

No indication NAGELL involved in espionage, Communist Party, or "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" activity.

DETAILS:

Mrs. MITSUKO NAGELL, nee
Mitsuko Takahashi, aka
Mrs. Richard C. Nagell
(divorced from RICHARD C. NAGELL)

On February 3, 1964, Mrs. MITSUKO NAGELL furnished the following information to SAS JAMES H. HOOSE, JR., and JOSEPH DOYLE POWELL at her residence at 440 South Union Avenue, Apartment 12, Los Angeles, California:

She filed for divorce from RICHARD NAGELL in Los Angeles on April 19, 1962, but has not received the final decree. NAGELL stayed out late nights, beat her, never gave


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 179

LA 65-7445

her any money, and did not like the children. She believes NAGELL's mother resides in the Los Angeles area, but she does not know the mother's address and has never met her. She repeatedly asked NAGELL to introduce her to his mother, but he always refused to do so.

Mrs. NAGELL stated NAGELL never exhibited any political interest, never mentioned communism or the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee," or Cuba. Once in the summer of 1963 NAGELL was mad about something unrecalled and jokingly said he was thinking of going to Russia, but Mrs. NAGELL is certain this was said in jest.

Mrs. NAGELL is of the opinion there is something mentally wrong with NAGELL. He would fly into violent rages without apparent reason. She pointed out that her television set has a split plastic case and stated NAGELL hit the set with his fist once while angry and this resulted in this damage.

Although NAGELL did not like his children, during the marriage, he has frequently complained about not being with them since the divorce. He sends them cards from various places in the United States, but has never since the divorce furnished support for the children or Mrs. NAGELL. As a consequence, Mrs. NAGELL has been supporting herself and the children through employment as a waitress and has to board the children out.

On March 6, 1964, Mrs. NAGELL stated to SA HOOSE that she never knew NAGELL to be involved in espionage in any manner. She further commented that they were always in financial difficulty during their residence in the United States. During the marriage NAGELL had a bank account at the Bank of America, Wilshire and Vermont, Los Angeles, but Mrs. NAGELL doubts there was ever much money in the account. She said that since the separation in April of 1962, NAGELL has sent her a total of about $180.00.

There is no information in the files of the Los Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with Mrs. MITSUKO NAGELL.

Mrs. FRANCES M. NAGELL,
nee Frances Kaufman
(mother of RICHARD C. NAGELL)

On March 5, 1964, Mrs. FRANCES NAGELL furnished
the following information to SAS JAMES H. HOOSE, JR., and
PHILIP J. REILLY at her residence at 856 South Catalina
Avenue, Apartment 104, Los Angeles:

Mrs. NAGELL stated that for many years and for
various reasons, none of which relate to this case, there
has been dissension in the family. However, until the time
that RICHARD NAGELL was in the airplane crash, they had gotten
along well together. Since the crash there has been a marked
change in RICHARD NAGELL, and Mrs. NAGELL is certain her son has
some form of mental trouble.

She saw RICHARD in Chicago, Illinois, in 1954, and
she moved to Los Angeles in May of 1955. It was then seven
ycars before she heard directly from him or saw him. She ran
into RICHARD by chance on the street in Los Angeles, saw that
he needed help, and thereafter tried to give him both moral and
financial assistance.

Mrs. NAGELL gave her son $1,000.00 on one occasion
and much smaller amounts on other occasions. He never expressed
appreciation for this help. RICHARD never seemed to have enough
money. She does not know if he had a bank account or not.

Mrs. NAGELL was trying to locate RICHARD after he
had disappeared for several days. She knew he could often
be found at The Happy Rabbit, a beer joint at 2709 West Sixth
Street, Los Angeles. She went there and found RICHARD, and
he flew into an uncontrollable rage because she had gone inside
this bar, claiming it was no place for a decent woman.
Mrs. NAGELL stated it was really not that bad a place. She
became definitely convinced after this incident that there
was something seriously wrong with her son. But even prior
to this time she observed RICHARD became extremely angry over
nothing, and he would cry without explaining what was troubling
him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 181

LA 65-7445

After above mentioned incident, RICHARD again would have nothing to do with her. She kept track of him through her other son, LOUIS, who is a year and a half older than RICHARD. Mrs. NAGELL was in a way happy to have the boys get together after years of estrangement. She described LOUIS as being an almost hopeless alcoholic. She thought since both sons had serious problems, they might be able to help each other. LOUIS has told her, however, that he was never able to straighten out RICHARD.

She stated that RICHARD never discussed communism, never mentioned Cuba or the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" or gave any indication he was in any manner involved in espionage.

On March 9, 1964, Mrs. NAGELL informed SA HOOSE that she wanted to point out that RICHARD had never physically abused her, that the abuse was always vocal. She also mentioned that she herself has been under psychiatric care for several years, and she does not think her problem has yet been eliminated.

There is no information in the files of the Los Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with Mrs. FRANCES NAGELL.

LOUIS KAUFMAN, true name
LOUIS NAGELL (brother of
RICHARD C. NAGELL)

On March 5, 1964, LOUIS KAUFMAN furnished the following information to SAs JAMES H. HOOSE, JR., and PHILIP J. REILLY at his residence at 10130 Samoa Avenue, Tujunga, California, telephone 353-1224:

LOUIS stated he got in trouble at age 16 and since that time has used his mother's maiden name as his last name. He considers himself to be the "black sheep" of the family and has had little contact with other family members until the last year or two. At one time in Korea he discovered he was in the same army outfit as his brother, RICHARD, and looked him up. RICHARD was an officer in intelligence while LOUIS was an enlisted man, and RICHARD did not want to have much contact with LOUIS. However, when their mother told RICHARD that LOUIS

- 4 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 182

LA 65-7445

had cancer of the throat in 1962, RICHARD went to LOUIS and
offered to help him. LOUIS later discovered he did not have
cancer and also discovered that RICHARD was the one who needed
help. LOUIS frequently saw RICHARD in 1962 and until about
August of 1963 when RICHARD left the Los Angeles area.

LOUIS considers RICHARD to be mentally disturbed.
He recalled an afternoon when both were at The Happy Rabbit
and the newspapers carried an account of the burglary of the
local armory. RICHARD told LOUIS he had pulled the burglary
and had some machine guns in his car parked on the street
near the beer joint. LOUIS immediately said he would like
to see the machine guns and the two of them welked out to the
car. LOUIS saw no guns and upon asking RICHARD where they were
the latter replied he did not know what LOUIS was talking about.
RICHARD said he had no recollection of telling LOUIS anything
about guns or burglarizing any armory. In addition to this
LOUIS said that RICHARD was usually in a state of deep
depression. RICHARD complained about his wife divorcing him
and about his employment problems.

RICHARD never spoke in favor of communism but he
did say that he thought the American government should do
more for him in view of his army service. He never mentioned
Russia. When RICHARD returned from Mexico City in 1962, he
told LOUIS he had gone to Cuba from Mexico. He gave no
reason for having made this trip. LOUIS has no information
indicating RICHARD was ever involved in espionage. He never
heard RICHARD mention the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee."

LOUIS does not know if RICHARD had a bank account;
he does know RICHARD usually was broke.

There is no information in the files of the Los
Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with LOUIS KAUFMAN.

FREDERICK HOWARD JOHN
(friend of RICHARD C. NAGELL)

FRED JOHN furnished the following information to
SA JAMES H. HOOSE, JR., on March 9, 1964:

- 5 -

201-746537


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 183

LA 65-7445

JOHN resides in a boarding house at 817 South
Catalina Avenue, Los Angeles. He is employed by the Hartford
Insurance Company, 548 South Spring Street, Los Angeles,

He has known RICHARD NAGELL for about one year.
He met him through BILL LYNN of the California Alcoholic
Beverage Controll at The Happy Rabbit. JOHN does not know
any members of NAGELL's family nor does he know of any other
close friends of NAGELL.

NAGELL left Los Angeles the first or second week of
September, 1963, Just before leaving he told JOHN he would
be traveling and asked him to share his Post Office box so
he could forward on the government disability checks which
he receives monthly. He also asked JOHN to mail him an almanac
whenever it was convenient as he liked to refer to the almanac
from time to time as a general source of information. JOHN
complied with both requests. Near the end of each month JOHN
has sent the checks to NAGELL at a Post Office box in El Paso,
Texas. He also sent him an almanac with a yellow cover as he
becalls it. JOHN did not mark or alter this almanac in any way.

JOHN recently received a form letter from a hospital
in Missouri, informing him he had been named as a correspondent
authorized to communicate with RICHARD NAGELL. JOHN has received
no indication that NAGELL is in any sort of trouble, and he
wondered what was behind the hospital letter.

JOHN has never heard anything about his receiving
four reels of microfilm or any personal papers should NAGELL
die. JOHN does not have a key to any safety deposit box and
does not know if NAGELL does or does not have a safety deposit
box. JOHN has heard NAGELL mention his sister but knows
nothing concerning any Japanese gas mask or anything else
stored with her which is to be turned over to him upon NAGELL's
death.

About a month or two after NAGELL left Los Angeles
he wrote to JOHN, probably just on one occasion, and that
concerned paying the rent on the joint postal box.

JOHN is of the opinion NAGELL is a paranoiac in
that he is depressed at the manner his ex-wife treated him
and the manner in which the local, state, and Federal governments
have treated him. JOHN definitely considers NAGELL to be mentally
disturbed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

LA 65-7445

JOHN has never heard NAGELL speak in favor of communism or Cuba. He has never heard of the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee." JOHN has no indication NAGELL was ever involved in espionage.

NAGELL never had much money, just his income from driving a Yellow Cab and from his disability check. JOHN does not know if NAGELL had a bank account.

There is no information in the files of the Los Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with FRED JOHN.

BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION

On March 5, 1964, LA T-1, whose information may not be made public except upon issuance of a subpoena duces tecum, stated RICHARD C. NAGELL had commercial checking account number 002-857 at the Wilshire - Virgil Branch of the Security First National Bank, Los Angeles.

The account was opened October 2, 1961, with a deposit of $350.00, closed January 31, 1963, no balance. NAGELL gave a bank reference of Bank of America, Wilshire - Vermont Branch, Los Angeles. Upon opening, residence was given as 4712 Saturn Street, telephone WE 4-2739.

LA T-1 recalls NAGELL vividly as he caused a commotion every time he came in the bank. He would shout at the tellers, complain about the service, and threaten to report the tellers to the management. On one occasion a girl teller working next to LA T-1 wore a red dress to work on a day that NAGELL was in the bank. NAGELL shouted at the girl that only a prostitute would wear a red dress.

LA T-1 thinks some local finance company has been trying to locate NAGELL recently to collect a debt.

On March 9, 1964, LA T-2, whose information may not be made public except upon issuance of a subpoena duces tecum, stated RICHARD NAGELL opened commercial checking account number 9-4492 on November 6, 1959, at the Wilshire Vermont Branch of the Bank of America, Los Angeles. NAGELL gave his address as the Cloud Motel, 3400 West Third Street. His bank reference was the Union Bank, Mount Holly, New Jersey, and he

LA 65-7445

Apparently exhibited New Jersey driver's license number 44342. Opening deposit was $900.00, and the account was closed September 27, 1961.

On February 28, 1962, RICHARD NAGELL opened checking account number 3-2873 at this same bank with a deposit of $143.10, the account being closed on July 16, 1962. During part of this time it was a joint account with MITSUKO NAGELL.

INFORMATION FROM INFORMANTS
AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION

On March 9, 1964, SA WILLIAM J. MC CAULEY was advised by the following that they had no information concerning RICHARD NAGELL:

ANTHONY F. LIBERATO, Investigator,
Immigration and Naturalization Service,
Los Angeles, who is cognizant of many
Cuban activities in Los Angeles.

MANUEL GONZALEZ, 1070 West Kensington
Road, Los Angeles, who headed the pro-
Castro movement in Los Angeles 1960-1961.

MAYER G. ROYAL, 5825 West Pico Boulevard,
Los Angeles, who is acquainted with some
activities of the "Fair Play for Cuba
Committee," Los Angeles.

LA T-3, who is cognizant of many Cuban
activities in Los Angeles.

LA T-4 and LA T-5, who are familiar with
Communist Party activity in the general
area where RICHARD NAGELL has resided in
Los Angeles.

There is no information of substance in the files of the Los Angeles Office of the FBI identifying NAGELL with any Communist Party, Cuban, or espionage activity.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 186

LA 65-7445

JOHN NOBURO MIYAKI (JACK MIYAKI) stated on March 23, 1964, to SA HOOSE that he and his wife, CAROLINE MIYAKI, reside at 645 North Westmoreland Avenue, Los Angeles, California. MIYAKI did not recognize name or photograph of RICHARD NAGELL. When further descriptive data was furnished MIYAKI, he recalled he had met NAGELL on one occasion about a year ago at The Happy Rabbit, a beer joint at 2709 West Sixth Street, Los Angeles

NAGELL told MIYAKI he either was or had been a Yellow Cab driver, that he had a Japanese wife who had divorced him. MIYAKI said he possibly told NAGELL he worked as a machinist at Aero-Space Manufacturing Corporation, 3825 / Cohasset Street, Burbank, California, but cannot recall having told NAGELL anything else. MIYAKI stated he thinks NAGELL left the bar at the same time he did which may account for NAGELL having MIYAKI's license number. MIYAKI drives a cream colored 1962 Buick Special, four door, license JOG 823. (California Department of Motor Vehicles verifies this license is for this car.) MIYAKI said he does not work on any classi- fied material and has no clearance. MIYAKI was born in Japan, naturalized in Hawaii on January 21, 1954, certificate number 7121559.

MIYAKI is of the opinion he and NAGELL only con- versed about ten or fifteen minutes on this one occasion, and he has no information apart from above concerning NAGELL.

There is no information in the files of the Los Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with JOHN (JACK) MIYAKI or CAROLINE MIYAKI.

Synopsis: Subject described by a former acquaintance in the United States Army in Korea as having had a brilliant war record but as not stable mentally, this instability probably being due to brain tissue damage resulting from an airplane crash during the Korean War. With regard to names found in the possession of the subject when he was arrested on September 20, 1963, U.S. Army, Japan, advised that the subject had previously served in Korea and Japan and that it was not unusual for individuals to retain lists of persons in such areas for future reference. U.S. Army, Japan, also advised that the reason for some names in the subject's possession at the time of his arrest could not be assessed. On June 9, 1964, subject sentenced in the United States District Court, El Paso, Texas, to serve ten years under the provisions of Section 4208 (a) (II), Title 18, U.S. Code, for violation of Section 2113, Title 18, U.S. Code. Subject attempted suicide on June 17, 1964. SUBJECT HAS ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

In addition, the subject had in his possession at
the time of his arrest on September 20, 1963, a piece of
paper containing the listing of what appeared to be United
States Army Officers and their serial numbers. One section.
of this paper was listed under the heading "Third Operations
Group".

On March 24, 1964, Lieutenant Colonel NAD W. GLENN,
Deputy G-2, United States Army, Japan, advised that he had
known the subject personally and had served in Korea with
the subject. GLENN noted that his name appeared in one of
the above mentioned photographs of papers which were found
in the possession of the subject when arrested in El Paso
on September 20, 1963. GLENN stated that he and the subject
had been attached to an Intelligence Branch of the United
States Army in the Far East during the period of their acquaintance.

GLENN explained that the names in parentheses in
one of the above mentioned photographs were "code names" used

5. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 192

EP 65-951
by members of Army Intelligence Units in Korea in order to protect their real identities from informants.

GLENN also advised that the subject was not stable mentally and that this instability was probably due to damage to brain tissues suffered in an airplane crash during the Korean War in which the subject was the only survivor. GLENN stated that the subject, in fact, did have a brilliant war record, which was the reason for his assignment to Army Intelligence in spite of what should have been an obvious psychological defect.

GLENN pointed out as an example of the subject's instability that the subject had turned in allegations against an Intelligence Officer in Korea, which became the subject of extensive investigation. GLENN added that te subject was subsequently transferred to another Army unit and upon reporting to that unit, was greeted in a friendly way by his new Commanding Officer, who told him he hoped the subject would enjoy his new assignment and that he, the Commander, would do all he could to make it a worthwhile tour of duty for the subject.

To this, NAGELL allegedly replied that the Commander had certainly better see that this was the case as, NAGELL told him, he made a practice of keeping a record of every move made by his Commanding Officer and if he stepped out of line one whit at any time, it would be made the subject of an immediate report to higher headquarters.

GLENN made available a letter from the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2/G-3, United States Army, Japan, which was in answer to a request for information regarding the subject and which contained the following information:

SUBJECT, after graduation from the Army Intelligence School, Fort Holabird, Maryland, in August 1955, served as an advisor to the First Republic of Korea Army and subsequently in Sendai, and Tokyo, Japan, terminating in about 1958. These assignments were concerned with intelligence activities.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 193

13-00000

EP 65-951

as an advisor to the ROK Army in Korea, and as a member of the US Army Counterintelligence Corps in Japan. During the latter tour of duty, the counterintelligence unit was designated the 3rd Operations Group, with Headquarters in Tokyo and Detachment B in Sendai, as referred to in photographic inclosures to your letter.

In assignments of this nature it is common practice for members to become acquainted with personnel of various Japanese security agencies, such as are mentioned in March 5 Memorandum of the FBI, El Paso, Texas. It is not unusual for individuals assigned counterintelligence duties to retain lists of these persons for reference in the event they are again reassigned to the area, or for dispatching cards or thank you notes from the United States. This would appear to be the reason for SUBJECT having kept the list of agency personnel, although to have retained the list for a number of years after leaving the service appears unusual. The names Kaji, Wataru and Jack Cannon were known to the public as the results of allegations of illegal intelligence operations that were publicized in the Japanese press, but SUBJECT'S reason for including those names in HIS lists cannot be assessed. Also, no reason can be given for the two or three miscellaneous names in NAGELL'S file.

The list of Americans mentioned in one of the photographic attachments pertains to US personnel in the intelligence field. It appears that the subject maintained a roster of those persons with whom he would or had contact, which is not unusual. Information contained on those rosters, particularly that portion indicating code names, was and is regarded as classified information by this office.

Files of the Counterintelligence Repository, USARJ, disclosed no information relative to NAGELL or of his aliases.

AT EL PASO, TEXAS:

On June 9, 1964, Federal Judge HOMER THORNBERRY, United

EP 65-951

States District Court, denied the motion for a new trial and sentenced the subject to serve ten years under the provisions of Section 4208 (a) (II), Title 18, United States Code, which provides that the subject can be released under parole at any time it is deemed advisable. This sentence was for violation of Section 2113, Title 18, United States Code.

The June 17, 1964 issue of "The El Paso Herald Post", contained an article entitled "Inmate 'Serious': After Suicide Try". According to the article, the subject swallowed several sleeping pills while lodged at the El Paso County Jail on June 17, 1964. According to the article, NAGELL was to be kept under observation all night and was to be transferred to the William Beaumont General Hospital from the La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution Hospital unless his condition improved.

The article further stated that Deputy U.S. Marshal JACK GRAVES said seconal pills had been prescribed for the subject and that the subject evidently had been hoarding them.

JOE CRAMER
JOE KRAMER
JOE CRANE
ROBERT C. NOLAN
Born-8--30, Greenwich, NY.

Nagell claims around the middle on 1962, he was in Washington, D C. and he had been approached by an individual whom he felt was either a Special Agent of the FBI or a Soviet Espionage Agent. He said he meet this person in a bar in Washington, D.C. located at 811 14th St, NW. He said this person talked of Domestic Intelligence and also talked of giving him an intelligence assignment.

Nagell claims in September, 1962, he was invited to attend a reception at the Soviet Embassy. He states he contacted CIA at either Langley, Virginia, or Elwood, Virginia, and used the name of JOE CRAMER or KRAMER during this contact with CIA. He said he told CIA the above information and wanted some advise as to whether to go through with such an assignment. CIA told him to see the FBI.

Nagell said he went to the above bar and there was contacted by the same person and was told to go to Miami, Florida, to a bar and wear a red sweater, where he would be contacted.
Certain material was seized from Nagell when he was arrested on bank robbery charges on 9/20/63.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation

ATTENTION: Mr. William O. Cregar

SUBJECT: Richard Case Nagell, aka
Joe Cramer
Joe Kramer
Joe Crane
Robert C. Nolan

Reference is made to a memorandum from your Bureau dated 2 October 1962, captioned as above. Representatives of your Washington Field Office have advised that Richard Case Nagell is currently under arrest for bank robbery and that the following names and information were contained on material and papers in the possession of Nagell:

RICHARD FECTEAU, Lynn, Mass
(DAC) (C.LA.)
R 58244 (MASS) (Jan. 63)

C. L. A.
1. Mr. F. PARKER
2. Miss GUTHRIES
3. Mr. C. CHURCHILL
4. Мт. J. DA VANON
5. Mr. J. SLOSS
6. Mr. E. LEIBACHER

The records of this Agency have been searched in regard to the above individuals with the following results:

SECRET

- 2 -

"Richard Fecteau, Lynn, Mass." is undoubtedly identical to Richard George Fecteau who is in prison in Communist China. Fecteau was taken prisoner by the Communists during an Agency operation in November 1952.

"Mr. F. Parker" may be identical to John Floyd Parker, current Agency employee, who was born 2 January 1898, Louisville, Kentucky.

"Miss Guthries" may be identical to Frances Agnes Guthrie, born 29 February 1908, Charleston, West Virginia, who is also currently employed by this Agency.

"Mr. C. Churchill" may be identical to Creighton Churchi 11 who was born 1 October 1912, Cornish, New Hampshire, whose present address is not known and whose address in 1952 was 27 West 44th Street, New York City.

John Floyd Parker and Frances Guthrie have been interviewed in regard to any knowledge of Nagell but neither individual has any recollection of having ever met Richard Case Nagell. Guthrie was employed by this Agency in Japan in the 1950's. Creighton Churchill and John Floyd Parker were in Japan in 1952 to interview and debrief United States servicemen who had been held prisoners of war by the Communists.

In view of the background of Nagell in the Far East, the possibility exists that Nagell could have obtained the names of Parker, Guthrie and Churchill in the approximate 1952 period, although a spécific statement concerning this cannot be made in view of the limited information concerning Nagell.

"Mr. E. Leibacher" and'Mr. Da Vanon" are believed to refer to Ernst Leibacker and Joseph Frances Davanon of the Los Angeles Field Office of this Agency. Your Los Angeles Field Office has been previously aware that Leibacker and Davanon have no personal knowledge of Nagell. There is no record of any past interest in Nagell by this Agency.

"J. Sloss" may refer to John Richard Sloss who was born 24 September 1919, Cleveland, Ohio and is currently employed in Headquarters by this Agency. John Richard Sloss has been interviewed in

regard to any knowledge of Nagell and has advised that he has no recollection of having met any individual by that name. If John Richard Sloss is identical to "J. Sloes," it is not possible from available information to even speculate as to how the name came into the possession of Nagell.

In view of the fact that Richard George Fecteau is currently in prison in China and the indication that the other six names listed above may refer to Agency employees, it is requested that the above information not be disseminated outside your Bureau. It does not appear that the above information could affect either the prosecution of or the defense of Nagell on the charge of bank robbery and disclosure of the above information could create a later cover problem for this Agency, as well as directing additional attention to the position of Fecteau.

It would be appreciated if your Bureau would advise this Agency of any information brought to your attention concerning how the above names came into the possession of Nagell.

Dear Floyd:

It was good to hear from you, to learn you are still at the old shop, etc.

I got your letter yesterday in New York, and while driving the 300-odd miles hoped that my subconscious would perhaps come out with a peal of a bell regarding an individual named Ed Nagell. But no bellsrang.

I have only a small hunch -- a piccolo-toot in my memory. When I worked for the shop I once went to see Mr. James Bennett, Director of Federal Prisons, (with whom I had once shared a table on an ocean liner, years before). You can guess why I wanted to see Bennett: I was seeking ways for birds to fly out of cages. Bennett mentioned a guy ( with a questionable record, as far as he was concerned) who claimed to know us, you and me, what we were doing., etc. etc. He had aproached Bennett " as from us". Ed Nagell -- the name rings a piccolo-toot on this, but only that. Incidentally, I filed a report on the incident when I got back to the shop.

I am often in New York -- at the Harvard Club -- and should you ever be in town, give me a ring. It would be fun to see you. I met Harry Osterweis in a restaurant the other day -- fater some many, many years. You may remember him.

I have recently become an author an Wines. After a year in France in 1959, I wrote a book on French wines which was published by Knopf, and am about to bring out one on wines of the world with MacMillan in September. That is about the extent of my news.

My best to you.

NAGELL consistently denied he had tried to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone. He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to Cuba".

A notebook which the Subject had on his person when arrested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the names of purported CIA agents and other information. Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge, decided everything against him in Los Angeles and made arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and eventually end up in Czechoslovakia.

4 Nov 1963: El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did",NAGELL told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank. I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time."

1 Jan 1964: NAGELL furnished a signed statement:
"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City, a representative of a foreign government preposed to me that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal offense and inimical to the best interest of the United States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May 1963, another representative of the same foreign government made the same proposal to me. At that time, I agreed to such a proposal."
"In September 1963, I was informed by an American, known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government, that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid proposal.
Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this same person to either participate as previously agreed or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person, although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I was arrested and am presently charged.
I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary, solution to the problem with which I was confronted. I am not guilty as charged."

Dear Mr. Plant:

In further reference to my letter from Switzerland: During our conversation of 6 April you made it clear that I must step back into time and prove the existence of a condition over ten years ago that could and should have been resolved by the Army then. a feat that is all the more complicated by the ABCMR's refusal to interview the appropriate witnesses, view certain pertinent records and to place the blame for my not receiving an adequate medical examination where it belongs.

I believe what you really meant to say was that in my particular case (as opposed to others much less valid) the function of the Board to correct an injustice does not apply.

So if this assumption is fact, as I have every reason to feel it is, then you may pass on to the Secretary that before my case is closed the Army will be confronted with a scandal that will make France's Dreyfus affair seem inconsequential by comparison. I am not quite the fool that apparently I have been taken for.

Very truly,

And it was a similar-sounding argument, ultimately reduced to a

# UNC Dismisses Red Infiltration Charges

MUNSAN-NI. Korea (UNC/ MAC)--A United Nations Command representative Friday branded as "wholly without foundation" Communist charges that two persons allegedly under UNC orders, had crossed the military demarcation line into North Korean territory on Apr. 27, 1967, to perpetrate "hostile acts."

Lt. Col. James M. Dyson, senior member of the UNC component of the team that conducted an investigation, informed his Communist counter- part:

"Complete and careful exami- nation and checking of the testimony and evidence in this case shows clearly that the conclusions contained in your report are not substantiated by evidence."

COL. DYSON was referring to to an on-the-spot investigation of the altered incident, conducted by a Military Armistice Commission Joint observer team May 23.

According to Communist claims, two armed personnel crossed the military demarcation line disguised in uniforms of soldiers of the Korean peoples Army and penetrated at 1,000 yards into Communist territory on the night in question before being stopped by Communist police. Demilitarized Zone.

One of the persons was arrested while the other escaped to the south, Communist witnesses said.

CHARACTERIZING the accusations of the Communists as "completely unfounded," Col. Dyson expressed denial of the charges "in the strongest possible terms."

3. The name of John SLOSS may be identical with the name J. SLOSS found on the person of Richard Case NAGELL when arrested in connection with a bank robbery in El Paso, Texas, on 20 September 1963. A notebook found on NAGELL made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the addresses of Foreign Embassies, the names of purported CIA agents and other information. Although NAGELL is unquestionably mentally unbalanced, he tells a story of being involved in espionage which is not fully contradicted by evidence. There is no apparent explanation of why the name J. SLOSS as well as five other names of CIA personnel should have been in the possession of Richard Case NAGELL. The weird story of NAGELL is contained in a chronological listing of his activities appended to this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SB

VIA : Chief of Station

SUBJECT : Celebration of Polish National Day, 22 July 1969

1. The undersigned attended the celebration of the Polish national day at the Polish Residence on Insurgentes Sur on 22 July 1969. The following points were the most significant:

a. The only Soviet the undersigned could identify was Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV, the Soviet Military Attache. Someone the undersigned's wife talked to mentioned the presence of the Soviet Consul, but this certainly was neither Valentin LOGINOV nor Yuriy CHERNYSII, and the undersigned did not meet that person.

b. Whether the Cubans were invited or not, they were not in attendance.

c. Jiri SVESTKA, of the Czech Embassy, was there. Per SB Section briefing, the undersigned mentioned his departure and told SVESTKA that at least he would remain in Mexico. SVESTKA said that this would not be the case, that he is scheduled to leave within 15 days for Czechoslovakia. The undersigned then mentioned a conversation with his Czech friend in which the latter told him that he expected to stay in Mexico for quite a while longer. SVESTKA denied ever having said this, pointing out that he was glad to return home. The undersigned made no further comments.

d. The ex-Haitian Ambassador, Julio Jean PIERRE-AUDAIN, was seen by the undersigned but left before he could talk to him. In view of the fact that PIERRE-AUDAIN ceased to be Ambassador of Haiti a long time ago, the undersigned feels that his presence at the Polish national day celebrations has some significance. He remembers that PIERRE-AUDAIN was also present at the celebration of the Czech national day this year. In other words, the Communists have made it a point to maintain contact with him, probably in view of the fact that PIERRE-AUDAIN may return to Haiti if something happens to DUVALIER and may secure a position of some importance in his country.

2. The President of the Consular Association, VOURVOULIAS, told the undersigned that he would contact LOGINOV at the Soviet Embassy to see whether the latter would agree to a joint celebration of both the undersigned's and LOGINOV's departures in a party to be held for both of them at the same time. LOGINOV is not scheduled to leave Mexico until September 1969, a departure postponed from the original schedule of late July or early August.

KEMO FOR THE RECORD

SUB Meeting of Cuerpo Consular de Mexico, 17 July 69

FR G A FERMEN

1. On 17 July 69 FERMEN and wife attended their first Consular Corps meeting with two other station Officers and wives. FERMEN was introduced to Lev GOLOVZOV, 201-850177,P-13,766 and Valentin LOGIKOV, 201-255412,P-11712 of the Soviet Embassy and to another Russian, unidentified, who appeared very reluctant to talk. GOLOVZOV was very civil but/a bit less expansive than his colleague, LOGINOV, who engaged in a constant verbal bantering with FADER. LOGIKOV and FADER have established a solid rapport which enables them to engage in the aforementioned antics without repercussions. LOGIKOV was accompanied by his wife, a very charming, quite women, who speaks acceptable spanish. She manifested a real interest in the chemical department of the plant, to the point of explaining certain charts and symbols to LOGINOV. She probably has had some chemical trai-ing. LOGIKOV himself appeared self-assured, sophisticated and able. He appeared not the slightest concerned over the verbal battle with FADER, and hold his cum during the exchanges. He looks strong physically, especially his hands, which could pass for a weapons. He passes out a disarming smile which he uses to his advantage, because FADER is at a loss for words, and came the smile. At one time during the return G, LOGINOV was capable into a small jump in. FADER said SISTONE.

2. GOLOVICV was, as previously tited, more reserved. He stayed in the background and accompained the unidentified Russian during most of the tour. FURALEV was introduced to him but little conversation passed between them. He appeared a little stiff, more the Russian stereotype of the reserved, social-ill-at-case person. But this was just an impression as FURALEV had noz chance for an indepth conversation. GOLOV.IOV seemed to possess decent spanish. He stated he was from the comercial section. Hopefully subject will attend other Corps meetings and FURALEV will have an opportunity to speak to him at greater length.

Subject: LIRAGON-1 (74805)

July 10, 1959

Date of Meet: July 9 st Fårense Restaurant-Bar (Newton) at 1650

1. Prearranged meet; L-l came on time; the meet lasted 2 hours and 30 minutes.

Next meet: Wed July 16 at 1650 at pick up place in Escobedo with Gutenberg

2. On July 9 at 0915 hrs L-l went to the Sov Embassy to look for LOGINOV (P-11,712). A Sov girly receptionist told him that LOG was not in and told him that he could wait in the reception roon or wait for him in the waiting room of Logs office. L-l prefered to remain with the receptionist(girl). He left after 55 minutes without seeing LOG.

3. When L-l came to the receptionist and asked for LOG she in turn asked him was he not L-1 (by first name only), son of their language teacher. L-l answered affirmatively and in turn asked her what was her name and how does she know him. She stated that her name was Alla LNU and that she recognised L-1 by his voice from calling for LOG. (NOTE: L-1 feels positive that at least 4 months have passed since a woman answered the phone when he asked for LOG).

4. In the beginning of the conv. L-1 found out that the girl was from Monow which certainly pleased L-l because he had what to talk about. She complimented L-l for speaking Russian without an accent, which was not the case with L-1s mother, the language teacher at the Sov Emb.

5. Results of this conversation:

a. Alla LNU is in Mexico city less than a year. She is bored to death here and is looking forward to returning to Moscow as soon as she will be allowed.

b. She said that Mexico had a pleasant climate, but all she knows about Mexico is Ouautla and even when she is invited there she has no company of her own (sic).

c. With regard to her schooling: after she finished


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

high school she went to a school for mechanical tech-
nicians where she studied about a year and gave it up
because she did not like it. She competed to enter the
school of modern languages at the university but she
failed. Then, she entered the M.I.M.O. (L-l does not
know what it stands for ) and after 5 monthe she had
to go to Mexico.

d.L-l told her that he would look her up occasinally
and she appeared to be pleased with the idea.
e. Description: apparent age 25 - 26; hight about 5 ft
3 in (possibly less); hair light brown; very nice eyee
(L-l does not remember the color ); buildt rather
stout; face rather long; in general: pleasant appear
ance.

6. Before leaving L-l left with her a note for LOG in which he
   stated that he can still be reached at the Institute between 1500 and 1600
   hrs and at home and added his phone numbers and concluded that if he
   did not hear from LOG it would prove he had a friend who turned out to
   be no good.

7. During L-le waiting in the reception room Yuriy OHERNISH passed
   by and they exchanged few unconsequential wurde, L-l asked YO did he
   give LOG the message he sent to LOG from that party (at Andreas OACANO )
   and he said that he did it with pleasure and added few words of his own.
   When YO left L-l asked Alla when was LOG leaving and she said LOG would
   leave in October '69.

8. At 1510 hrs of the same day LOG phoned to L-l in the Institute
   and after some verbage they agreed to meet on Monday July 14 at the
   Karinera restaurant at 1300 hrs (AV Chapultepec with or near Liverpool).
   Both of them stated that they would be there without fail.

9. With regard to the meet LOG - L-1 I repeated my previous in-
   struction to L-l concerning his attitude if LOG comes out again with
   the request to meet LIOVAL-1.

10. With regard to L-ls acquaintance with Alla I suggested L-l to
    ask his mother about her. There is a possibility of finding cut her full

name and whether she is married or not. L-l should also mention to GOG the fact that he met Alla while waiting for him. Depending on the find- ings L-l should consider inviting Alla to his house for lunch one Sat or Sun and take her with his wife and child to the Parque Asturiano to spend the afternoon. I told L-l that I would pay for the expenses for lunch and possible entertainment. I-l will discuss the matter with me before doing anything.

11. L-l reported that he had a 90 minutes talk with Karel WENDEL (see Attachment) and I debriefed him on the same. There were very few facts which were not covered in the previous report on WENIBL.

12. As it became obvious that the working part of the meet was over L-l stated that he would really feel bad and blow off his top if he did not see XARTASUK until the end of the month. I told him that KARTASTY had put long period of work in the States and consequently his leave war extended for the same amount of time and I can spend that time where he pleased. L-l commented that in that case he would extend the deadline of becoming nasty to Aug 20. I laughed. L-1 commented that probably I was not able to understand how much he was attached to KARTASUX.

July 9, 1969

Date of meet: July 7 in Subjects car and Insurgentes Samborne Bar

1. A meet was prearranged with Subject for July 7 at Del Paseo at 1400 hrs. Subject phoned to our office in the course of the morning to confirm the arrangement. ( FERNALD was trying to reach Subject to change the place of meet, but he was not able to reach him), Subject did not show up at the Del Paseo and after waiting 40 minutes F went home ( his office ). At 1535 hrs F was infoed by the office that Subject called several times and his latest statement was that he would be in front of the Cine Latino ( across the Reforma from our Embassy ). F came there on time but Subject was not around. Due to heavy rain F was bound to stay there and at 1630 hrs Subject showed up in an impressive Pontiac Boneville, blue with light top, plates BD 755 Texas, Hemisfair (black). Subject waved to F to get in the car. Next meet: Friday July 11 at Bonaparte at 1400hrs

2. In the car Subject stated to F that he goofed, because he went to the restaurant where we met twice previously and after some waiting and phoning he looked at his notebook and realized that he was at the wrong place. He apologized. Then, Subject stated that he had to return the Boneville and take another car and he asked F to have a ride with him. Subject took the car to Leibnitz and perked it in front of the apt building at 297. He excused himself for few minutes took newspapers, a small bunile and 2 miniature bottles of some liquor and entered the apt. About 5 minutes later he returned and we entered an old, beaten up Valient without license plates and the e is hard to tell.

3. During the first ride Subject tolf F that LOG phoned hic on Friday July 4 and told him that they would have to postponed their test scheduled for the next day because he (LOG) would be out of town on Sat and Sun. LOG wanted to meet with Subject on Mon or Tue

P-11,710


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

and Subject told him that he would be taken and working with 2
American businessmen who would arrive on Sunday. Subject added that
they would bring a tennis hat for LOG ( they did). LOG said that us
would want to visit Josephine AZCAYAGA, probably on Thursday July 10,
but would phone him to arrange for a meet before coming to his (and
Josephines) apt. LOG also reminded Subject & to prepare him for
that meet a written report on the opinion of Mexican government
officials about the Interamerican Economic Conference at Port of
Spain.

3. After returning from the apt Subject told F that LOG had,
   phoned to Josephine end told her that he would visit them on Thur
   a little after 2000 hrs and that he would bring to Josephine 2 bottles
   of Votka.

5. Then, Subject asked F when should he arrange for a meet
   with LOG, because in front of Josephine they do not speak about
   politics. F told Subject that the logical thing to do would be to
   take advantage "of the social gathering" with LOG to make arrangements
   for their next meet. Subject agreed and asked ? whether our security
   people decided to give or not to give the directory to him for
   passing it LOG. F told Subject that he messed the matter by bringing
   into the picture a nonexisting Patricia which we were not able to
   produce. Therefore, the first step is getting rid of Patricia, which
   means to get to the point of F's first instruction: Subject really
   has no close friend or contact in the U.S. Embassy and is willing
   to develop one if LOG insists on getting the directory: Subject is
   willing to follow LOG's instruction regarding how to go about it.
   With regard to "Patricia" Subject will have to state that she did not
   return from her leave and he does not know why.

6. At that point Subject and F were already at the Diana
   Circle and Subject suggested that they stop for a drink in Insurgentes
   at Samborns which is only a couple of blocks from his office and F
   agreed. They remained there about 50 minutes.

7. Subject stated that the directory has become a problem.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

commented that the existing problem was created by Subject and his
not compiance with the instruction; the only way out of it now is
to do what ? told him in the car.

8. In reply to F question Subject stated that the 2 Americans
   who arrived here on Sunday July 6 were interested in investing capital
   in a cuinery a housing project for people of low income. He added
   that one of them is owner of a mining corporation and the otherone
   is from the Beneficiary ( if rembered correctly) Insurance Co. Ke
   belives that they were satisfied with the findingsm but it will take
   about a month before the deal materialices, because the approval of
   appropriate board was needed.

9. Subject showed to F a calling card of Ir. C. Lester McGee
   ( or MacGee), President of Moon Valley Lining Corporation,
   3113 Oakland Ave (or Street), Dallas, Texas. There were at least
   two other addresses listed which F did not remember. Subject went
   on to say that Fr. NacGee was interested in buying platinum, but
   Subject told him that Nexico had no platinum and that once the Sovy
   were trying to sell a quantity in Mexico. Mr. NacGee told Subject
   to look into the matter and explained him the mechanics of the deal.
   Sove would have to make a firm offer to a Swiss company which is
   controlled by a Canadian company which is in fact a subsidiary of
   an American company: ultimate destination of the pistinun is the
   U.S. Reportedly, the deal is all the way through a clean legal
   commercial transaction and terms of payment would be Irrevocable,
   Confirmed Lester of Credit, cash on delivery in Switzerland. The
   intial purchase would be 5,000 ounces but there is will to buy up.
   to i cillion Collars worth of platinuz. Subject asked should he
   ask LCG are the Sovs interested in the deal.

10. F told Subject he should tell about it to LOC if there is
    a commission for the person who facilitates the deal. According to
    Subject there is a $1.- Commission per ounce if he can provide
    the goods. F told Subject he should express the desire that LOG
    oitain the into himself and if the answer is savorable and the price
    right then I can introduce Subject to the Sov official who will


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

be authorized to close the deal. Subject agreed to emphasize the attractiveness of the comission end the advantage of the fact that the deel is handled in Switzerland and consequently the commission is also paid there. F Cold Subject that he wanted to know in detail LOGS reaction concerning the commission. Subject should also play around with the theme that it would be adeal if LOC could trevel to Switzerland te introduce him to the right person (Sov) and similar.

11. Subject commented that the buyer is serious and it remains to be seen are the Sov willing to sell at a convenient for them but still fair price. Subject went on to say that if the deal was to go well he would have to go to Switzerland, and this arizes another problem, i.e. how long would it take for him to get American Passport, because he id presently documented by his Birth Certificate. F told him to start thinking about passing thet bridge when he comes to it.

12. Subject appeared to be satisfied with Fs attitude in the abovέ conversation and he commented that with this matter showing up plus the tennis hat and the written report there should be enough for a meet with LOG. F told Subject that he wanted a carbon copy of the report he would hand to LOG and Subject precise to make one..

13. Then, Subject observed that in order to place the business talk with LOG in the right prospective he would have to see LOG before Er. LeGee and his companion leave, which means the latest on Wed noon. F. told him to go ahend and make arrangements which would be normal if he was trying to push the platinum deel, but if he gets to see LOG before Thur at his (Josephines) apt, he should advise 7 by phone, 1.e. leave a message for F to ring him up.

14. Comment by Fernaid:

b. Even if nothing comes out of the platinus deal, which is quite likely, conversation about it and the associated commission, should give us some reading on LOG on one hand and on the ctier shed more light ca the personal relation between Subject and 10.

b. The so call- social relation between crephine and 200 is interim to say the least.

Subject: Valention LOGINOV- Bio Sketch by LIFACON-1

Remarks:

1. Concerning the problems which Log has with his colleagues LIHACON-1 was not able to offer specific examples. In at least 3 instances LCG spoke to L-1 that the psychological atmospher within the Sov Embassy is horrible and depressing. LOG stated that there was not a single person in the Embassy in which one can confidet everybody is ready to cut otherones throat just to advance; if there is nothing the colleagues can pin against a person they start intriguing hoping that one might lose his temper and commit something stupid which would be sufficient to harm the person involved: if ones asks for advise he would in no time find out that he was considered incompetent.

In Fall 1963 L-l invited LOG to attend a party and told him that Yuriy CHERNISH (P-13,042) would be there. LOG stated that he would not come, because it would mean or getting himself in trouble or getting CHERNISH in trouble; to keep away from Sov colleagues is the only of keeping out of troubles, concluded LCG.

2. With regard to the statement that LCG was commiting errore by exterting pressure on other people L-l stated that he reported LOGS renewed attempt to recruit Niguel Angel. In doing so LOG abandoned his tact and ignored the sensitivity of the other person; LOG talk to L-1 in Cuautla tock place in less than a month from LOG's pitch to Miguel Angel: the way ICG spoke to E-l made it evident that LOG disregarded ops security rules. Such things did not happen before and L-1 concluded that or rent all out to ecileve sole success fore he leaves 208 "cost what it may"

When 1-1 stated thet te believed that 10 would be a good perron ander normal conditions, he meant that he believed that 504 is basically a good person and would be acting and tehaving as a good preson in kis normal environment, i.e.. if he remained as a meik on the farm, or he was a tractor driver or a truck driver and sikiler, cecerise in such conditions 100 would do a good for end mouil cot have to depend on rental capability which he does not have.

4. L-l does not know why LOG expresses such a great love and admiration for Spein and Spaniards. L-l feels positive that LCG was never in Spain; he has no reason to believe that LOG did any extensive reading about Spain; in fact L-l believes that LOG knows about Spain what he heard from Spaniards who leve in the USSR and, apparently, he was associating with a number of them in Moscow.

En este sentido es muy vanidoso. Muy pocos amigos saben que tiene una hija de 16-17 años. Cuando le preguntan si trene hijos hable solo de su hijo de 11 años de edad. Le da pena presentar a su mujer, que es muy amable y buena, porque se ve de mas edad que el. No fuma, toma *aguariter* muy poco, aunque cuando la ocasión requiere de tomar mucho agucenta y siempre se le ve sereno. Es muy amable en el trato. Nunca trata de imponer sus ideas, pero siempre pendiente de convencer por las *who take of posto point of crice)* buenas a sus contrincantes. Cuando ve que no puede hacer lo último, rompe diplomaticamente los relaciones amistosas con el sujeto.

En sus ideas es de la escuela estalinista: solo cuenta lo Unión Soviética y la última, linea a seguir del Partido. Eso quiere decir que no tiene ideas propias. Sigue fidelisimamente la "linea" porque sabe muy bien que es la única forma rápida y eficaz de escalar en su carrera. Le gusta muchísimo la vida buena, tipo occidental, aunque antes se dejaría cortar un brazo que confesarselo asi mismo. Es muy ambicioso y se ve que tiene problemas con sus compañeros de trabajo. Hable despectivamente de ellos. No le gusta nada la idea de tener que permanecer en Moscú lcs dos años que vienen. Ma dijo que haría lo posible que al transcurrir esos años lo mandaran de preferencia otra vez a Mexico. Su ilusión más grande es trabajar en España. Adora a los españoles. La forma de ser de los mejicanos no le gusta. Por eso si quiere regresar, quiere decir que prefiere cualquier lugar donde vivir, menos Rusia. Creo que precisamente

insistió, llegando al *celeeio* de preguntar si podíamos abordar a
mi alumno John, sin siguiera preguntar por la personalidad y forma de
pensar de John: En los 15 miautos que estuvimos jüntos no habló mas
que de eso. Cuando yo le dije que ya le había dicho antes que no
me gustaba esa clase de trabajo, me contesto que el creia que lo
que me pasaba es que tenía miedo. La forma más inocente de hacerme
picar! A continuación, me invito a comer el dia 8 para seguir
hablando de lo mismo! En el fondo creo que todo eso revela cierta
inocencia y muchas ganas de progresar, para llevar una vida muy
diferente a lo que llevan los ciudadanos soviéticos. Creo que
quiere dejar una grand impresión a sus jefes para no quedar trabajando
indefinidamente en el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Mosca.
No se hasta que punto sus ambiciones puedan *guiarlo*. a progresar
incluso por medio de atropellar victimas. Como persona y en condiciones
normales me parece bueno, generoso y fiel amigo. Sin embargo la
verdad es que nunca lo llegue a conocer muy bien, en parte posiblemente
porque casi desde el principio sentia instintivamente que quería
algo de nt, muy aparte de nuestra amistad y en parte porque con todo
y la confianza que llego a tener conmigo jamás se descubrió por
completo, ni mucho menos. Es extréniadamente canteloso.

Rebuniendo: Mi impresión es que es una buena persona, de buenos
santizientos, pero que una vez metido en "ese trabajo," por razones
que desconocemos, hace todo lo posible por destacas.

Date of Keet: July 1 at Seps-Paris a 1900 hra

1. This meet was held in lieu of the one scheduled for June 30 at 1400 hrs. Subj requested the postponment of the meet by phone on grounde that LOGINOV did not show up for the meet on June 25 and another meet with him was arranged by phone and will take place on June 30 at 1400 bre. PERNALD phoned to Subject the same day of his call and arranged to see him at Seps-Paris restaurant at 1900 hrs. F who came to the meet place 5 minutes earlier found Subject there waiting for him. The meet lasted 5 hours in spite of the fact that paid the bill 2 hours before Subject decided to leave.

Next meet: Konday July 7 at the Del Perseo at 1400 hrs. Note: ?. will change the reet place to a more modest restaurant.

2. Subject irmediately scked what was the decision concerning the Emb directory which LOGINOVnds asking for. ? told Subject that the directory was his last worry end that he would like to hear how did the things go with LOGINOV. Subject started speaking about the meet (see separate Attack.!

By the time Subject was through with his description of the meet, ? obtained a more convenient table and as XE moved to it. requested Subject to write additional date to his FRQ-I which he did promptly. Then I asked him to write the chroco sequence of his contacts with LOGINOY which Subject did by looking in his agende and he did it Ithout hesitation.

3. At this point Subject told? hat he had seen him in the vicinity of the place where he met with LOTION. stated that he was there and that the purpose of being there was that Subject nee him. He asked tid ? also see LCG and stated that when he saw Lon coming he moved in the direction from which subject we coming. concluted by saying that the fact that? wep there himself should be sufficient to assure Subject the we keep operational costore reperieted to a tale of persons for reapons of a rit.

4. ? looked at what Subject trete conerning to ceata rith


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

and told Subject that according to the plote rerrere he left for F it appeared that LCG did not come to the meet scheduled for June 25 end not as he put it on paper. Subject repeated what he wrote and confirmed that on June 20 Juligeet did not show up and on June 25 LOG aidzis came and Subject did not show up (LIE PRACE surveillance confirmed the latter statement ). I observed that on his first meet with Subject on June 23 Subject said that he had a meet with LOG on June 25 and told him that he had no time to try to get the directory. Subject showed no embarrassment and he told that he must have mieeundertood Subject's statement.

5. F told Subject that he did not follow Fe instruction in speaking to LCG about the directory, specifically, by bringing up a name of Patricia which created a problem without which he would be much better off. The fact is that Subject brows nodody in the U.S. Embassy. Subject was of the opinion that we can always introduce him to a person in the Emb who can play, the role of being his acquaintance. ? told Subject that we were not care pulling rabbits out of a hat and all our actions were conducted within limits of security. That Subject was suggesting was a complete disregard for our as well his own security and the best thing he can tell LOG on their next meet was that "Patricia" did not show up es yet.

6. It may be noted that is attempt to debrief Subject on what transpired at each of his maets with ICG did not tear desired results. Subject stated the facts he mentioned to ? on their first meet and started repeating himself as he was going on. Therefore, F decided to get as detailed as possible description of the last meet and Subject was cooperative. Although, Subject spoke about the last meet at the begining of our weet he did not aina trying putting it in sequence as it took place. From what Subject stated previous meets it may be worthwhile noting that Subject had a party at his apt on June 10 and he asked LCG to come to the party. Lo explained Subject that he did not like to be seen in large group's and he sent Subject 2 hot lem of Votka for the party. Subject also stated that in 2 - 3 instences de promised 10G to bring hic a tennis hat frow the T.S. Actually, LO would like to inve 2 tennis hats, one with a vinor and the other type with e ris around, size large. Subject had an epirtualty of dolas it, but at the proper cement ha forgot about 14. Loc etille brings up the fact that Subject forget about him and

his hats, Subject asked ? was it possible to get those hats for him.
? said he did not know if it can be done.

7. Subject asked ? what type of a reception will be given on the 4th of July by the Emb and was there something arranged that any American could drop in, as signing the book at the Emb. promised to prove to Subject in case there was something like that.

8. After covering the ground as contained in the 3 attachments ? asked Subject was he willing to back his statements with a polygraph test ( ? used the expression 'lie detector test' ). Subject reacted by asking when did we want him to take the test. ? commented that he did not say that Subject would be given one, he only asked would he be willing to take one, if we asked him to do it. Subject stated that he was willing to take the test at any time. Then, he started asking questions about the test, especially, who usually gets it and how it works. With regard to who gets ? stated that anyone involved in matters having hearing on the security of the U.S. and as to how it works, there is nothing to it: it registers when a person says a lie as the stomach digests automatically anything a persons eats..

9. Comments by FERNALD:

a. This meet enables us to have a better insight of Subject's personality.

b. There are valid indications that Subject is not withholding important info concerning his personal history nor his activity.

c. His claim to have numerous and to an extention influential contacts appears to be acceptable.

d. He also appears to be cooperative, but has a tendency to deviate from the instruction given to him concerning his attitude toward LCCINCT. It is possible what thin is due to his conviction that he knows LCI better than we do and that we are too dogmatic and not enough flexible. At the same time this may be due to the fact that he loves clandestine activity for the sake of pleasure he gets out of the game as such on one hand and on the other, he might fear that our proposed course of action may all-late LCI from him, in which case he could be left without a game he likes.

e. It appears quite obvious that Subject's financial conditions are not rosy, but, apparently, he has a shelter, is well dressed and does not have to worry about being hungry. Therefore there is left enough room for him to lead the life as he pleases.

Subject: James SABORI

Date of Meet: June 23 at Subjects Apt at Bahia de Sta Barbara 20/508

1. Arrangements for this meet were made through the office and the fact that the phone which Subject left with cur office was out of order made it necessary that FERRALD call on Subject at his apt. It may be noted that Subject is in the process of moving and the only furniture in the living room of the above mentioned apt consisted of two beaten up easy chairs w/o arm rest and a sort of an end table loaded with papers and a telephone; another phone was on the floor in the corner of the room. There was so much dust on the floor that it is difficult to believe that the apt was in any use during the last 10 days.

2. Subjects NEW ADDRESS: Leibnitz 297 apt 7 phone 31-53-93

Office: Fraccionadora de Bajio, Insurgentes Sur 429 office 12 (first floor), phone 64-63-47.

Subject can be reached home until 0930 in the morning and in the office between 1100 and 1400 hrs and in the afternoon between 1700 and 2000 hrs. Subject stated that it would be rather difficult to find him in his office because of his frequent "in and out" work.

3. COMMO with us: Subject was told that once he was placed in contact with the "proper people" he should use from now on the extention 870. He will identify himself as Sr. ARVIZO ( allegedly his mother's family name ) and will asks for Sr. Virgil (FALDINI) FZRNAIDS alias.

4. FERRALD showed Subject his official looking credentials under alias of Virgil 2. BALDINI and after he read them quite carefully, stated that now Subject knew that he was speaking to the right person an. Subject commented that he was satisfied with is bona fide.

5. F first asked Subject few personal questions; the phone is out of order because he requested that it be transfered to his new apt and on Saturday (June 21 when he saw that the phone was not in operation he called "his friend Carlos acier" to put pressure on the Telephone Co but nothing could be done in view of the week-end: the elevator in the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

building is often out of crder, because there are too many children in the building: Subject is married and has 2 children, but he is prescatly separated from his wife; as the children finished the liigh School his wife wanted them to continue their schooling in the U.S.; Subject avoided specifying what school his children attended here and called the school "the American High School: Subject has been in Mexico 4 years and his wife only 2 years; as much as he loves l'exico so much his wife did not get used to Mexico and did not want to remain any longer here; the fact that he did not want to leave Mexico resulted in their physical separation; according to Subject it is only a matter of days that his family left for San Jose, California, which Subject called his home town; Subject claims that his family ( paternal side ) comes from Milan, Italy; his great grand father came to New York, NY, and fellowed the gold rush to California where he apparently did well; for reesons unknown to Subject his grand father noved from California to Arizona and then to Mexico (Sinaloa) were Subjects father was born; in the same breath Subject stated that he, too, was born in Mexico and when commented that it would be logical that he... have a dual citizenship, Subject did quite bit of talking to confuse the the previous statement: during the revolution all the records were burned. and he has only the certificate of baptism issued by a Mexican church and in fact it was possible that he was born on the U.S. side of the border; Subject claims he could not care less about the possibility of claiming Mexican citizenship, he is an American and it suits him well to live in this country as a TOURIST: in the Fraccionadora de Pajio he works with a partner, who entered the company as owner of 2 large chunks of land; Subject had no money but he is the person who through his connections obtained from a Mexican bank a decision that the bank would mortgage up to 90 per cent every structure he and his partner complete; now he is in the stage of obtaining American investment capital to carry out the construction of low income housing (2 does not recall the location Subject mentioned); of course Subject went through financial difficulties and is still facing some of them, but nothing serious; He has a car of his own; he is roving out of this apt and will sub-let it and make few hundred pesos per month on the difference of prerent price and what he is paying: this type of transactions cennot get him in troubles, because Lexicans do not care about much thingr; he has a friend in the Schernacion


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

The once showed him that the Gobernacion bed more than a foot high
file on him and Subject told him they should not bother trying to do
something against him beceure they concot even kick him out of the country:
he has a friend to whom he is authorised to turn if he is in any kind of
trouble and he asked his Gobernacion to dial the phone which he gave him
and the phone was answered by CISNLROS of the Presidency: Subject claims
that he has influential friendsin practically every ministry (Secretaria)
of the Federal government; Subject also prides himself with women friends
he has and the also influencial.

6. In answer to Es quetion Subject stated that he called on Mr. at the U.S. Erbassy because he had a fairly close relation with Valentin
   LOGINOV (P-11,712) of the Soviet Embassy and he would not want to be
   judged wrongly if the WOFIRM people get to know about his friendly relation
   with LOGINOV...

7. F. commented that he hoped that Subject realized that the title
   on his credentials really spells Counter Intelligence, which, for example,
   means that if F saw Subject robbing a bank he could not care less because
   that would be the matter concerning the criminal police, or if was charged
   for having a child out of wedlock, because that would be a catter for."
   the judiciary authority, but when it comes to spies than that is a matter
   which concerns F and the service ne is working for. In view of the
   well established fact that LOGINOV is a spy and Subject is his friend (sic)
   this matter is of concern for the American Counter Intelligence. Therefore,
   would appreciate if Subject stated clearly what was the purpose of his
   visit to the U.S. Embassy. Subject answered without hesitation nor
   embarrassment that he believed that he made himself clear even at the
   Embassy that he wanted to cooperate with the U.S. Service and be of help
   as much as it stood in his power. commented thet he would probably ask
   Subject does he still want to help the U.S. Counter Intelligence before
   we close our meet today.

8. In reply to Fe questions Subject stated:

a. He net LOGINCT in February 1969 at a social perty in the house of
Dr. Frederico ARIK, who is as is commonly known a
Communist by his lieology. He does not know were there
other Soviet officiels at the party. LOGINCT first


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

- 4 -

spoke to Subject in a heavy accented broken English and was delighted when Subject cuggested that they speak Spanish. LOGINOV8 general line of conv was that the essential thing in the life is understanding and to be able to understand others one must get to know them; this in turn calls for having as many friends as possible. The same applies to countries and nations. Before leaving the party LOGINOV stated that he would like to become friendly with Subject and asked hin would he be willing to meet with him. Subject agreed and they met next Friday at the Tecali Restaurant.

b. The conv at the Tecali was to an extent dealing with the theme of friendship and understanding with an added emphasis that if there was understanding and, consequently, friendship between the U.S. and Soviet Union we would be living in a much better world. Subject stated his agreement with LOGS views. In a further part of the conv LOGINOV was interested in knowing whether Subject had many friends in Mexico Subject claims to have stated that he had many good friends here. (NOTE: It is quite likely that he bragged about the number of influential friends he had here). At the end LOGINOV told Subject that he would like to see him again and Subject asked him to come to his house. According to Subject, LOCINOV asked would not the fact of receiving a Sov official com- promise Subject or lead him into some kind of troubles. Subject assured him that the receiving of a Sov or

any foreign official could not affect him in no way. Then, LOGINC asked Subject would they be alone and Subject answered affirmatively. (Note: At this point Subject indiceted that he received LOGINOV at the apt at the Icibuits 297). Finally, LOGINOV agreed to come to Subject's ept.

Subject poured and he drack only efter Subject tock a sip out of LCG's Class (Semark: This certainly sound exaggerated). Turing the evening La wes repeatedly speaking about his need to have friendsi zake new new friendships and was pointing cut that Subject was able to help in that respect. Subject stated to that he offered to LOG to introduce him to any friend of his he wished. In the course of conv LOG was asking Subject verions questions concerning politice, econom and trade in Nexico and Subject was answering with a degree of familiarity with topics. Jeg felt that Subject was well informed and he asked him how come that he was so well informed, is he perhaps a TOFIEN man. Subject laughed at the question and added that in fact he hated "OPIRI and everything associated with it. LOG gave Subject his phone (epparently the callin card) and told Subject that he should not be phoning to him and that it was better if they agreed in sa- vance when and where they would meet next.

d. From this point Subject gave up describing chronolo- gically the developments. He stated that there were about 10 additional meets with LCG. The place they used most extensively was the La Cava. They usually were meeting at 2000 hrs, i.e. the time when the restaurants have the minimum of guests. Subject believ that LOG started using La Cava rere frequently for their meet because of the fact that the of the fact that the Tecall close

Subject stated that out of pure curiosity he observer LOG coming to their meeting place: Leaves his car 5-7 blocks way from the place, beards a bus, gets out a block beyond the Greting place and comes walking slowly and making occasionel steps to observe whether he was followed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

f. Subject stated that the leitmotif of LOG during those
beete was "helpne and I will be able to help you",
"get me (or provide me with) the info I need and I will
provide you with info you might need". Among the most
saught info by LOG was personality info on Kexican
politicians and, especially, indications as to who
will be the next President of Mexico. LOG is very
cuch interested does SCHOVARPIA stand a better chance
to become the next Fresident than CARRILLO FLOARS.
Later it became an obsession to find out what was
SEAL reason for Rockefellers trip to LA countries,
LOG discounted the fact-finding as any reason, because,
according to him the U.S. embassies and the CIA in
those countries know everything that is to be known .
Consequently, LOG is convinced that there must an
important reason for ROCKY's trip. Subject added that
there very many other rinor questions concerning the
Nexican scene which interested LOC and to a fair
extent he was able to get the answers. Nevertheless,
LOG started asking Subject did he have friends in the
U.S. Embassy here. Subject was answering casually
with an "of course". On the reet Subject had with
LOG on June 9 at la Cava LCG told him that he needed
an Embassy phone directory and he anked Subject cán
he get him one. Subject promised to try. LOC brought
to Subject's attention that he needed the waw directory
because the Embassy changes the directory every six
nonthe.

E. In reply to 78 question Subject stated that CG told
his that he needed all the info he was asking for to
advance politically in his career on one hand and on
the other to dispell misunderstanding to which the
lack of info may easily lead.

h. With regard to LOC Subject described him as a licable
person with quite liberal view on international po-
litice; he passionately hates Krupichov and is


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

deeply concerned over the danger Red China represents to the world; he advocates that the U.S and Sov Union Shouldesign a cutunl defense fact and liquidate the China until there is still time; he believes that Sov Frion and the E.S. are entitled to act in defense of their own interests and to hell with what the rest of the world snys", he acaires the determination and dynerise of Americane.

9. After getting through this portion teld Subject does he still feel that he should ret end give LOG the Fab Fhone Directory. Ee stated that he was willing to do what we tell him to do, but he believed that if he came to the meet with LCG on June 25 without the directory, ECG would consider him as worthless, since was not able to obtain something which he can get in some other way. When I connented that the diredory was a tightly controled matter and to get one would practically mean to swipe one from somebody desk, Subject stated that he was convinced that LCG. would not care for a directory which ho stole, because he is interested in subject having a friend in the embarsy through whom he would have access to info, and presenting the directory would be an indication that Subject had a friend there.

10. Then Subject replied negatively to a theoretical possibility of obtaining a directory "lerslly", told him that he must necessarily be aware of the fact that ICG could not be satisfied with ith a statement that he obtained the directory from fr a woman or man friend; LOG would insist in knowing the name and the redress of the person who is his friend. Subiect pretended not to be convinced about this but did not try to arque about it.

11. Then I told Subject that whether ne odrits/it to himself or not That he was trying to maneuvre himself into was a double agent role stich is by no means an envious role. A person who is offering his cooperetion to the U.S. under such conditions should be aware that every piece of info passed to the opposition, in this case LOC, must be cleared end approved by an U.S. officer which, if nothing else, is a tire constmirz proposition. Subject sailing said "time is money". Ecocented that only productively used time is money.

In a heavy and serious tone 'F stated that he must ask now Subject whother after the explanation he gave he is still willing to cooperate with the U.S. Service under the condition that he would follow oure instruction and guidance without any reserve. Subject answered Yus and added that he was ready and willing to do whatever we tell him to dos

13. F asked Subject did LOG tell him when he was leaving Mexico. Subject eteted that Loi did not rention hie departure and Sulject felt certain thet there was no inmediate departure in sight.

14. F told Subject that he would went think this matter over and clocuse it with some of his colleagues and, therefore, would like to see him tomorrow. Subject stated that he would buisy in the morning and when I asked him what about the afternoon, Subject asked what about heving a lunch together. I agreed and picked up SZP-Paris ar the place and it was agreed that they would meet in the restaurant at 1400 hra.

15. F feels that Subject is a sort of a Soldier of Fortune, a pleasant and long talker; among his lexicon contects not mentioned to the above are D.Fiqueira and Augustin PARRIOS Gomez. To impress F with closenees of bis relations with BARETOS Gomes, Subject scored F AGE annual par for all the movie houses in town and added that AEG gave hir the pace. This fact might be interesting but it does not dispell the temptation to consider Subject to be a neme dropper.

1. This reet was held in lieu of the prearranged meet for Junels which L-l cancelled by phone. Due to the peculiarities of L-16 working habits I was not able to reach him by phone until June 20 at 1600 hrs when this meet was arranged.

2. On June 18 1-1 was without car and he felt obliged to cancel the meet. He stated that he felt heppy to have made up with his wife and to be living again home. He told me about his arrangement to go to the Russian show with LIOVAL-1 and wife. He described me the developments as LIOVAL-1 reported them to me.

3. With regard to his a "contact" with LOGINOV which he hinted by phone, there was nothing to it. L-l was at a party given by Andrea САТАÑO (P-13,545) I on June 14 at her house and YURIY CHIPNISH (P-13,042) was there and they exchanged few words about LOGINOV (see the attachment). L-1 stated that he was not with LOGIKOV since the encounter in Cueutia and did not speak to him since the attempt to reschedule the lunch which was missed on May S. Therefore, the story L-l gave to LICAL-1 on June 13 about LOGINOV being disappointed with the fact that he had to return home, etc, hae, quite likely, no connection with any recent developcents. Further, it 10 feftdro cuite te obvious odvi that L-l did not know then about the fact that LOGINCO was postponed 3 - 4 months.

L-l did not know how it came to the point that ECGATHEREV was invited to the party. L-l considered it as a significant fact that CERMISH came to that party with his wife.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: James SABORÍ

1.  At 1300 hours on 20 June Subject, on the recommendation
    of Bob JOHNSON (formerly with LNERGO in Guadalajara), came to the
    Embassy and contacted COS. Subject apparently has known JOHNSON
    and had asked JOHNSON to whom he could talk in the Embassy about
    a delicate matter. JOHNSON had recommended COS, identifying him
    only as a First Secretary.

2.  Subject identified himself as an insurance salesman who
    is in Mexico as a tourist and who apparently hopes to do some
    business here. He is of Italian origin and apparently has lived
    in Texas and California. At the present time, he is living at
    Bahia de Santa Barbara #20, apartment 308. Telephone number is
    31-53-93.

3.  Subject's story was that he has been in contact with
    Valentin LOGINOV (P-11,712) (he showed COS LOGINOV's card) and,
    as a matter of fact, has had no less than 12 contacts with him.
    He is scheduled to have dinner with LOGINOV tonight (20 June) at
    2000 hours but he would not say where as he was afraid that COS
    would contact the CIA people and surveil him. He is also scheduled
    to have dinner with LOGINOV on 25 June. In the past, they have
    had dinner at such places as La Cava and the other Tecali Restaurant.

4.  Subject refused to say very much about the nature of his
    contact with LOGINOV. His reason for contacting' COS was to get a
    copy of the latest Embassy phone directory, which LOGINOV had
    asked him for. He wanted to bring it to LOGINOV so that LOGINOV
    would do things for him. He did not say exactly what LOGINOV
    could do for him except that LOGINOV had invited him to visit the
    Soviet Union. LOGINOV has also given him several bottles of vodka.
    He was not worried about what LOGINOV could get out of him because,
    after all, he was just an insurance salesman. In other words, he
    seemed to be enjoying playing games with LOGINOV and was not
    particularly ready to cooperate with us. COS said that he would
    have to contact the "proper people" to see about the phone book.
    Subject asked COS to do that and said that he would call CoS at
    1800 hours on 20 June to get the answer. He also said that if the
    "proper people" were interested, they could contact him at the
    address and phone number given above.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

5. When Subject calls at 1800 hours, he will be told that COS has gotten in touch with the "proper people" and that a representative of these people will call Subject on 23 June. As for the phone book, COS will say that this is entirely out of his hands and that the man who contacts Subject on 23 June will presumably deal with that.

6. My plan at present is to have Bruce H. FERNALD (P) call Subject on 23 June and attempt to get as much of a debriefing as possible without being hostile or aggressive. I am looking at the long-range possibilities here because, unless there are unexpected developments, it is probably too late to use this against LOGINOV. However, if Subject has really been cultivated so assiduously by LOGINOV, the chances are that LOGINOV will turn him over to his successor, assuming that Subject continues to show the promise that he has apparently shown thus far. I want FERNALD to get as much as he can out of Subject without either frightening Subject away from LOGINOV or ruining the possibility of future cooperation against LOGINOV's successor. As for the phone book, I have no intention of passing it, at least without knowing a lot more about what is going on. Subject can be told and can pass on to LOGINOV that this is a tightly controlled publication and that it will not be very easy to come by (that is, unless he manages to steal one on his own). Also, if Subject (who is, at least to our current knowledge, unwitting of COS' affiliation) mentions COS! name to LOGINOV, LOGINOV's appetite may be greatly wetted to find out that his new contact has gone right to the top.

7. There are no Station traces on Subject.

8. Subject called at 1800 hours 20 June. He was given the message in paragraph 5 and agreed to await a call from "the proper people" at 0900 hours on 23 June. He also agreed to stall on the phone book.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: LIREALM-1 CONTACT WITH AEDIEHARD

1. The attached report from LIREALM-l was received on 16 June 1969. LIREALM-1 verbally added the following comments to the information in the report:

a. Although they have not attended any social functions together since their last encounter, it is LIREALM-1's opinion that AEDIEHARD is generally avoiding direct contact with him. Only once since LIREALM-l told AEDIEHARD that he was insulted by CEDIEHARD's request that LIKEALM-1 work for him has ALDICHARD asked LIKEALM-1 to play tennis, LIREALM-1 has seen AEDJEHARD on various occasions at the French Club, but neither have made any effort to speak to the other..

b. AEDIEHARD requested permission to bring a Mexican couple to the 21 June awards dinner. This was a strange request since the party was intended to include only those who had participated in the tennis tournament at the Club. Permission was granted, however, and LIREALM-1 will attempt to determine the identity of the Mexican couple at the party.

c. Both LIREALM-l and his wife ane convinced that AEDIEHARD is avoiding introducing his Soviet friend to the friends of LIREALM-1's wife. She has placed herself in a position, on a couple of occasions, where AEDIEHARD had to be almost impolite in not introducing his friend to LIREALN-1's wife, but he has chosen not to do so.

2. Based on the instructions given LIREALM-1 after the last incident between him and AEDIENARD, he has not gone out of his way to engage MEDIEHARD in conversation or cultivate him socially. This might explain AEDIERARD'S standoffishness and/or his apparent unwillingness to introduce his new friend. More information on this subject will be available after the 21 June dinner.

DATE OF MEETING: 11 June 1969

1. As arranged last month, I picked Subject up on the corner of Nilo and Melchor Ocampo lateral at 1100. We drove to the Tastee Freeze in Polanco for coffee and met until 1300. Next meeting will be on 9 July at 1100, same pick-up place.

2. Subject seems like a real diamond in the rough with earthy and sensible philosophy. I was surprised at his promptness and the fact that he doesn't forget meeting dates, even though they're arranged a month ahead and there's no confirmation. He told me that he frequently gives away candy and stuff to the little Sov kids who come in, feeling that they'll remember it years from now when they're fed a line of propaganda about the West and that this will make an impression and help offset all the bad things they hear.

3. I brought with me the Soviet mug flash cards to have Subject identify those who come into his store frequently and then he refers to by his own personal crypt's (since he usually doesn't know their names). Following is the key to identifications:

"The Professor": ASTAKHOV
"Colorado": DAVIDOVSKIY

Said his mother in the USCR (who neither smokes nor drinks) is very religious. She keeps a picture of Christ hidden at home and many of her women friends come to pray in front of it. SOLOMATIN did not come to Subject's house for dimer on 1 June as planned because he couldn't get permission.

Subject: LIBACON-1 (P-4805)

Date of Keet: May 21 at the Paris-Mexico Restaurant

1. This meet was held inlieu of the one scheduled for May 14 which L-l postponed by phone. Lal was at the pick up place 10 minutes before the scheduled time but I was there still earlier and I observed nothing suspicious in terms of stakeouts or surveillance. The meet lasted 75 min. NEXT MEET: Wednesday May 28 at the same pick up place.

2. As we met L-l stated that he cancelled the last week meet because he was seized by one of his nervous crisis of hysteria followed by depression (sic). He immediately added that he prepared for re nothing because in his condition he was not able to do any work...

3. In the restaurant he kept on describing what effect the nervous crisis has on him and he added that he still felt depressed. During his description he did not indulge in dramatizing the matter.

4. I asked him what happened to the lunch he was supposed to have with LOGINOV and he repeated what he told me by phone on Kay 8 and added that LOGINOV was to call him but did not do it. He added that if LOGINOV had called during the past 8 days the phone would be answered only if his wife was home. I told him that this fact was a reason for him to ring up LOGINOV, because, as we discussed and agreed on the last weet, it would serve no good purpose to L-1 if LOGINOV would characterize him as a not desirable person from the Sov point of view. He commented that be believed LOGINOV was a friend of his to the extent that he would not do such a thing to him. I countered by stating that he insisted in con- sidersing LOGINOV to be his friend, but what ever LOGINOV asked fron hir he turned him down with & No; to preserve good will of a person it is necessary to meet some of his requests and the best is to do it when it does no harm to anybody and at the same time does not get L-l in- volved in any of LOGINOVO schemes. He agreed with my reasoning, as he did at the last meet, but it is to be seen what will he do about it.

5. To change the subject I asked L-1, Karel return. He said


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

- 2 -

he knew nothing about VENDEL, except, that his wife gave a birth to a child during his absence and he added that if VENDEL had returned he would had heerd about it.

6. Speaking about Carel he recalled the fact that Carola HIRSH, an Ecuadorian girl of 22 approx. returned to Mexico and she will be taking an intesive course of Russian from L-1. He stated that he spoke to KARTASUK about this girl: she was here and worked with the Olympic committee as an interpreter; after the Olympics she went to Ecuador and now she returned here; she came with her mother who found her an apartmant in Rio Elba where they had a worming up party on Friday key 9; her father is a well to do phisician in Quito, Ecuador; she has no permit to work in Mexico which means that her father will pay the expenses of her stay here: in view of his nervous crisis he did not keep in touch with her, but he believes that her mother had returned to Quito by now: LOGINOV knows her from some of the parties L-1 and his friends were giving during the Olympics or briefly after them.

7. He forgot to tell me that he was with Andrea CATANO (P-13,546) after she returned from her trip to the US and Canada and she told him that she definitely broke with CHERNISH (P-13,042) by telling him that she had a boy friend about whom she is serious and who is a jealous type: he (C) is wellcome to come to her (parents) home when he wishes, but she is in no position to reet with him out.

8. I asked L-1 was it possible that LOGINOV, who according to him was driving hard to axtara achieve some success before he leaves, might have attempted to recruit Juan Luis ALVARES, director of the language school on Tiber, during the past 2 months. L-1 stated that he doubted that JLA would even want to see LOGINOV because LCG in many instances ignored JLA's requests through L-1 to pass by the school. L-1 went on to say that if by incident LOG got hold of JLA and made an attempt to enlist his services, L-1 was positive that JLA would had turned him down. (NOTE: This leaves unsolved what was L-1 speaking about when he spoke to LIOVALA about the good time LOGINOV and JLA had together at unknown date).

9. I tried to explain to L-1 that he should do some writing for us along the lines of waxt our previous agreement. He promised.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

10. As much as L-l is a compulsory talker, during this meet he was ratiner on the quiär side,i.e., he spoke when he was asked something. He had only 2 drinks and he tokk some food with them. He was interested in leaving on time which was pleasant news to me.

11. On the way to his car I asked L-l what he thought about the death of 16 Sov Generals in 15 weeks. He commented to the effect that a publisized purge of big wheels is intended to silence the opposition and this may be necessary in view of the fact that a number of soldiers will start returning from Czechoslovakia and their stories would be the opposite what the government used as excuse for invading Czecho.

b. L-1 can be reached during woeking days on phone 23-99-34 from 0800-1410 hrs at his school; on phone 75-10-03 at home except Wednesdays when he will be home from 1600-1700 hrs.

c. L-l can use the extention 870 to leave a message for F (whom he knows under the alias of Victor Brandon). I-l will usually stated that he wants to ses on given day and time, which means that he will be waiting for Pat a restaurant which will be sellected as their meet site on their next meet.

3. Security:

a. Standard security practices will be applied to P - L-1 personal meets and other operational activity.

b. On their next meet a new meet sight will be selected.

c. For internal use only: C instructed F that with regard to what can be said to L-l there was no use of getting into the security for the sake of security: if it would serve any useful purpose of telling L-l that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

we recruited LIBACON-1, then he should be told.about it.

4. Admin & Finance:

a. L-l considers it probable that he owes LIBACON-1
payment for several lessons. He will ascertain the
amount and F will pay it on the next meet.

b. C infoed L-1 about the status of the order of a Folboat
and was tild that when it come F will deliver it to him.

c. With regard to ops experses former agreement remains
in power.

5. Operational:

a. L-1 reported on LIRACON-Is statements to him about
LOGINOV on May 2 (reported separately). This provided
a taylor made openening for operational Cirectives.

b. L-l will continues his contact with LIBACON-1 through
language classes, because LIBACON-l is still a person
of interest to us.

c. We received from other sources info that LOGINOV would
leave PCS in July. In view of the fact that Sov IS
officers are judged home by the mecanical computation
of their activity abroad, our experience shows that
a good number of then try to embelish their record
in the last 2-3 months before their departure by
establishing contacts and making recruitment attempts
with disregard for security riles and sound operation-
practices. We have sufficient indications that LOGINOV
falls in this category of Sov IS officers without
trying to determine whether LIRACON-18 statements to
L-l may be an additional indication to that effect.
As far as we know LOGINOV it would be in line with
his recent behavior if he approached L-1.

d. If L-l is approached by LOGINOV or another Sov official
he will act friendly and speak about his frienship
with Pavel YATSKOV. L-l will make a remark to the
effect that PY failed to keep his promise and send him


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

-3-

his Moscow address.

e. If LOGINOV, or whoever it may be, disclaims knowledge
about L-1 - YATSKOV friendly relation, L-l will speak
in terms that this fact ought to be a common knowledge
in the Sov Embassy.

f. If the person making the appreach accuses I-l for
trying to buy a Sov official (PY), L-l pretend that
the approacher is grossly mistaken and will open a
barrage of questions to determine what was known
here about the PY case. If the correct sum involved
in that case is centioned, or place the pitch was made
or other detail(s) indicating that the approacher is
cognisant of this specific case, L-l will politely
ask what the approscher wanted from him and will not
hesitate to tell him that the same offer applies to
the approacher.

g. If LOGINOV makes the approach under the pretext of
wishing to maintain friendly relation with L-l and
admite knowing PY and having heard about Pys friend-
ship with L-l he will be treated friendly and L-1
will invite him to a dinner and let him talk. In
such a case it would be obvious that LOGINOV would
want to pass L-l to somebody else.

h. When, whoever it be, would attempt to recruit L-1
he will stick to his guns of being an American patriot
and will turn him down by stating that he was able
to make a better offer to the recruiter.

ATTACHMENT to TURNOVER Report
May 15, 1969.

Source: LIOVAL-1 (p-

1. ON May 2 Rafael gave a language lesson to LIOVAL-l and on that occasion he stated that LOGINOV had taken Juan Luis, Director of the language school on Tiber, for a day of having fun. It was not olear whether Juan Luis and LOGINOV had a night on the town or they went out of town for a whole day "to have some fun".

2. Rafael told L-l that he did not understand such an attitude of LOGINOV, because he considered LOGINOV to be a good friend of hist he was surprized that LOGINOY did not invite him together with Juan Luis, in fact, he could not explain to himself how something like that could happen.

3. Rafael went speaking about LOGINOV for some time about how good he is basically as a man; how pleasant companion he is and what a good friend he 18.

4. L-l pointed out that there was nothing factual nor significant in what he said about LOGINOV, but L-l was puzzled by the fact that "out of the blue sky" Rafael was speaking about LOGINOV and kept on speaking and speaking.

5. L-l believed that Rafaelo pride was hurt that by the fact that LOGINOV ignored him, especially, when there was a chance of having some fun. Therefore, L-l told Rafael that it was possible that LOGINOV wanted to invite him too, but was not able to reach him by phone, which wouli not be unusual in view of the fact that Rafael is practically never home.

6. On this same occasion Rafael asked LIOVAL-l if he would be kind to pay him the lessons which he owed him. In view of the irregularity of Rafaels appearances to give lessons L-l war not certain whether he owed anything or not. Rafael corroborated his request by stating that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

his wife writes down every payment Rafael receives and the book shows that no payment was received since Jan or Feb 27 (IP does not remember which month was mentioned). L-l stated that if it so, then, Rafael must be right. Because he was short of cash he paid him Ml 150.- and stated that he would pay the remainder the next time, i.e. the next lesson, which was scheduled for Wed May 7 at 1700 hrs. ( NOTE: Rafael had A meet with RHP on the same day at 1620 bre, and it was him to pick up this day and time. Rafael came to this meet on time ).

7. The fact that Rafael did not show up for the lesson was no surprise to L-1. Nevertheless, about 1830 Rafaele wife phoned to L-1 and asked to speak to her husband. When L-l stated that he was not there she commented that he was supposed to be there at 1800 hrs. About an hour later she called again and L-l had to state that he did not come at all. Then, the requested L-l to give to Rafael the sweater of her daughter which was accidently left at L-ls place. Of course nothing hàppened, but since that moment L-l did not hear from Rafael nor his wife. L-l pointed out that this was unusual, because if Rafael skipps a lesson hế calls the next day and never later than the third day to apologize. Further, the sweater which Rafael was to pick up from L-l, according to the wife's statement, was a part of their daughters kindergarden uniform. L-l concluded that he was inulined to believe that Rafael got angry with him or because he questioned the correctness of the claim for payment or because he placed him on a spot by telling his wife that he did not show up at L-Fs place.

8. L-l was told not to take the matter so seriously since there was stili a chance that Rafael and his wife were on a war path and they had no time for anything else. L-l was requested to try to contact Rafael or his wife as soon as possible. L-l considered that May 15 (Teachers Day) would be the best time to do it and there was no objection on his choice of date since it offered a botter chance of finding Rafael home.

9. L-1 was also requested to bring to Rafaels attention that the irregularity of lessons inconveniente him quite bit on one hand and on the other Rafael loses the money........

10. Comment by Rift The fact that L-l pointed out that Rafaels talking About TOCINOV does not mean that anything happened recently, still calle

Valentin LOGINOV (7-11,712)
Source: LIBACON-1 (P-4805)

1. On May 3 Source went with his family to Cuautla to spend a day out of town. There, as he arrived he bumped into LOGINOV who was leaving. They talked 15 minutes.

2. LOGINOV asked Source was he still giving language lessons to that American(LIOVAL-1). As Source answered afirmatively LOG told Source that he would like to meet LIOVAL-1. SOURCE stated that LIOVAL was not only a student who pays his lessons but was also a good friend of Source. Then LOGINOV became quite blunt and agressive: he outright demanded that LIBACON introduce him to LIOVAL. LIBACON tried to reason out with LOGINOV that by meeting LIOVAL he would achieve nothing because LIOVAL was a good family man, a person conscious of his responsibility for 4 children, liberal in his way of thinking but definitely a patriot and a person who is attached to his way of life and could not care less about Socialism. LOGINOV then insisted that he and LIRACON have a lunch together "next" week to talk this matter over. LIBACON agreed to lunch with him on May 8, i.e., a day after he meets with me.

3. LIBACON told me that he would stick to his guns and refuse LOGINOVE request to introduce him to LIOVAL. One of special reasom for doing so, in addition to his desire of not getting involved with that gang (KGB), was that he considered LIOVAL to be a friend of his and would not want to do anything which could make LIOVAL suspect that LIBACON wae a KGB collaborator.

4. Other, than the fact that LIOVAL existe I know nothing about him, but the sole fact that he is an agent of our forced me to assume that he was picked up for a good reason and that we must have an objective for holding him. Therefore, I felt that it would not be wise to let LIBACON shut the door to a possibility ( kaw as much remote as it cay be ) that we counted on the porribility that LIVAL be approached orcontacted by a Sov official. Further, I kept in mind that we would not want LIBACON, to alip into a double agent role. Therefore, I instructed LIHACOR

a. He wishes to be on friendly terms with LOGINOV, but certainly it is not a friendly attitude of LOGINOV asks him something impossible. (Try to get LOG to do explanaing).

d. Repeat description of LIOVAL's personality as he did in Cuautla and ask what can LOGINOV possibly achieve by meeting LIOVAL. It is anticipated that LOGINOV may be brief and say that this would be his problem and that all FILIED LIBACON had to do is to arrange for an introduction.

c. LIRACON will insists that he does not want to get involved "in that kind of business", especially, because it was clear to him that even if LOGINOV achieves nothing, he lost nothing, but LIRACON 18 a sure loser because he would lose a friend and possibly get tagged as a Sov spy.

d. If LOGINOV does not break off his insisting at this point, LIBACON will state that he would agree on a plan, if LOGINOV had one, by which LIOVAL would be in LIBACONS company, but no introduction of LOGENOV as a friend of LIBACON would be made. We played it back and forth discussing various ponsibilities, but important was that LOGINOV should come up with a plan and that LIOVAL be given a possibility of saying to LIBACON that he did not want to come.

e. After the lunch LIBACON will go to his institute and I would phone him there to find out at which point the conv with LOGINOV ENDED.

1. In accordance with the prearrangements I phoned to LIRACON-1 to the language institute at 1455 hrs to hear how did the scheduled lunch go.

2. LIBACON-1 stated that a pu student of his postponed his lesson for a half of an hour and that he phoned to LOGINOV to come to the restaurant they were to lunch about 45 minutes later than they had agreed to meet there. LOGINOV told LIBACON that in that case he prefered to postpone the lunch to the beginning of the next week and that LOGINOV would phone to LIBACCN-1 to set the date and time.

3. According to LIBACON-1, LOGINOV sounded friendly on the phone.

Valentin LOGINOV

Edad aproximada de 43-45 años, aunque aparenta menos. Fisicamente de complexion atletica, alto. Juega muy bien al tenis. Recientemente quedo en segundo lugar en el campeonato del D.F. que tuvo lugar en el Club Francia, donde practica este deporte. Cuida muchisimo su condición fisica y mas que nada su apariencia. En este sentido es mus vanidoso. Muy pocos amigos saben que tiene una hija de 16-17 años. Cuando le preguntan si tiene hijos hable solo de su hijo de 11 años de edad. Le da pena presentar a su mujer, que es muy amable y buena, porque se ve de mas edad que el. No fuma, toma muy poco, aunque cuando la ocasión requiere de tomar mucho aguanta y siempre se le ve sereno. Es muy amable en el trato. Nunca trata de imponer sus ideas, pero siempre pendiente de convencer por las buenas a sus contrincantes. Cuando ve que no puede hacer lo último, rompe diplomaticamente los relaciones amistosas con el sujeto.

En sus ideas es de la escuela estalinista: solo cuenta lo Unión Soviética y la ultima linea a seguir del Partido. Eso quiere decir que no tiene ideas propias. Sigue ridelisimamente la "linea" porque sabe muy bien que es la única forma rapida y eficaz de escalar en su carrera. Le gusta muchísimo la vida buena, tipo occidental, aunque antes se dejaria cortar un brazo que confesarselo asi mismo. Es muy ambicioso y se ve que tiene problemas con sus compañeros de trabajo. Habla despectivamente de ellos. No le gusta nada la idea de tener que permanecer en Moscú los dos años que vienen. Un dijo que harta lo posible que al transcurrir esos años lo mandaran de preferencia otra vez a México. Su ilusión mas grande es trabajar en España, Adora a los españoles. La forma de ser de los mejicanos no le gusta. Por eso al quiore regresar, quiere decir que prefiero cualquier lugar donde vivir, menos Rusia. Creo que precisamente

porque ya tiene que parti: on Julio, es por lo que ultimamente esta
cometiendo errores. Quiere hacer gentes a como de lugar, presionando
a la gente de _inuxe_ que antes jamás hacia. El dia 3 de mayo lo vi en Cuaulatla, y sabiendo que yo no quiero trabajar para el, me insistió, llegando al colecio de preguntar si podíamos abordar a
mi alumno John, sin siquiera preguntar por la personalidad y forma de
pensar de John: En los 15 minutos que estuvimos juntos no hablo mas
que de eso. Cuando yo le dije que ya le había dicho antes que no
me gustaba esa clase de trabajo, me contesto que él crefa que lo
que me pasaba es que tenía miedo. La forma mas inocente de hacerme
picar! A continuación, me invitó a comer el dia 8 para seguir
hablando de lo mismo! En el fondo creo que todo eso revela cierta
inocencia y muchas ganas de progresar, para llevar una vida muy
diferente a lo que llevan los ciudadanos soviéticos. Creo que
quiere dejar una grand impresión a sus jefes para no quedar trabajando
indefinidamente en el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Nosco.
No se hasta que punto sus ambiciones puedan quiarlo. a progresar
incluso por medio de atropellar victimas. Como persona y en condiciones
normales me parece bueno, generoso y fiel amigo. Sin embargo la
verdad es que nunca lo llegue a conocer muy bien, en parte posiblemente
porque casi desde el principio sentia instintivamente que quería
algo de mi, muy aparte de nuestra amistad y en parte porque con todo
y la confianza que llego a tener conmigo jamás se descubrió por
completo, ni mucho menos. Es extrentadamente cauteloso.

Refuniendo: Mi impresión es que es una buena persona, de buenos
Bontimientos, pero que una vez metido en "ese trabajo," por razones
que desconocemos, hace todo lo posible por destacas.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: BESABER (P-8777)

DATE OF MEETING: 10 April 1969

1. In response to BESABER's phone call, I met him at his hotel room in the Aristos from 1430 until 1545. Next meeting will be on Tuesday evening, 15 April at home.

2. Subject had nothing new to report on contacts with BENOXers, but said that he is now raring to go on any requirements I might levy. He said that all of his financial problems are now solved (as I surmised they would). Essentially, he has sold 50% of his business (INZA) to a syndicate-group that is paying off Subject's debts. They will construct a big new factory complex in Cuernavaca to bring all of Subject's manufacturing enterprises under one roof and double capacity. They're also going to open up offices and a showroom on Insurgentes Sur. Subject figures he will probably stay active for a couple of years more and then sell his remaining 50% for about a half million dollars.

3. I told Subject again that I am now anxious for him to establish a social relationship with SPYRA (P-6601) and that I am no longer interested in his developing NAJCIHCHRZAK per se. I suggested that he might use KAJ simply as an entree to meeting SPYRA, ostensibly to work out a cultural program of Subject's grandfather's music as mentioned previously. Subject said that he would get on it right away and would try to call the Ambassador on Tuesday when Subject is back in town.

cc: P.6601 cc: P.6235 cc: P. 11,712 File: P.8777


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

4. I also asked Subject to get back in touch with Boris CHEYKOV (P-6235) and Valentin LOGINOV (P-11,712) to warm up the relationship. I pointed out that we should be prepared to have Subject in a position to give them gifts in the event Head-uarters approves the plan to bug some of Subject's Trojan horses. Unless therd is some reasonably good contact established in advance, his presenting gifts will appear too contrived. Subject agreed and said that he would give them a phone call soon to try to get together for drinks. Judging from past history, CHEYKOV will be ready to see Subject for a night on the town in August.

5. I paid Subject $3000 (MN) constituting half of his retainer for three months (Jan., Feb. and March) and agreed to have the balance of $3000 for him on Tuesday. He gave me a pile of hotel bills and other expenses which will be charged against the $3000 revolving fund he has outstanding. He asked me if I could get him a case of champagne, a couple of bottles of cognac, a bottle of gin. I told him that I'd see if these are available and that, if they are, I would charge them against either his salary or fund rather than as outright gifts as in the past.

PLACE ACQUIRED: Tennis courts of the French Club
REPORT BY: John Francis

Val apparently waiting for me to make first move. I saw that Val was not playing, but looking for a part- ner white talking to Meche Pinto and an other girl. He was two courts away from me. I finished playing with my spikant opponent. I couldn't see walking over to Val and invite him to play. He knew I was finished. He also owed me an opology for the cancelled luncheon date.

I shouted loudly to a ball-boy to find my favorite trainer. Val dashed over to say he would like to play.

Excuse for missed luobb. I "what happened to our luncheon date", I asked with no smile. Val said that Dimi had been bitten badly by a dog. I told Val that I had already heard that story and that Dimi had been bitten nearly a week before our date. Once again I did not smile and gave him little opporltunity for a gradious acceptance of a poor excuse. It was clear that I was annoyed. I could see from Val's expression that he was embarrassed and off-balance. He has a pecu- liar facial expression when he has been püt at a dis- advantage.

Val admitted that the bite had been much earlier, but he explained that the wound had become inflamed and he had to take Dimi to a doctor. I saw Dimi and he had one of the smaller Bandaids on his arm. He seemed to be having no discomfort.

I accepted Val's excuse tacitly.

We played. Unfortunately Fal won 6-3, 6-1. I remind you that I switched to my left arm some time ago and am still at a disadvantage. I still apologize for letting the barbarian win. I had to leave at 1145. Immediately threeother men invited Val to make a fourth for doubles. I had hoped to talk to him when we finished.

Conversation, I finally had to interupt Val while the men were still warming up and take him to a corner of the court.

I told Val that I had honed to tell him something ot the lunch and on several other occasions but was always interupted. Now I wanted to tall him what I had in mind. I wanted him to understand that his nolitical jokon nad eniarrassed mo. That I did not want to create a aceno and had nover commented on thes. But I would not tolerate thom in the future.

I said that his offer to give me money to work for
his government had embarrassed me in front of our mutual
friends. Further, my polite refusal to make an issue of
his approach could have been interpreted as tacit accep-
kaace of his offer to pay me for treason against my
country.

Yal interrupted and said it was all a joke and
that he thought I appreciated that it was nothing
more than a joke.

I said I knew it was a joke, but could not speak
for our audience. My position as a businessman here
could be jeopardized if someone thought we were serious.

I told Val that in any case, joking or not, I do
not discuss politics or religion with my friends, par
ticularly here in Mexico.

He acted very surprised and amused.

I pointed out that I consider myself a guest in
a very hospitalbe but foreign country. "These people
are my hosts. You are a diplomat. You can, you must
discuss politics. It is your job. I cannot. I actually
am not interested in politics. I am not well versed
in politics. But if you must talk politics with me,
let us go some where in private, without an audience.
If you want to discuss business, fine! I know that
subject and I like it, and I am even better with an
audience, particularly Mexicanl

val had his transparently disturbed, distressed
and disadvantaged look. He promised never to discuss
politics with me again. He apologized. He said he
understood what I meant.

# SUBJECT: Gloria Pinto

# DATE OF INFORMATION: 26 March 1969. 1300-1355 hours.

# PLACE ACQUIRED: Office of John Francis

# REPORT BY: John Francis

Telephone call to myoffice. Gloria called to say she was having some trouble finding clients for my business. She asked when she could see me. I suggested immediately and she arrived about one hour later.

Personal chat prior to business. Gloria followed good Mexican custom in chatting lightly before getting to the matter about which the meeting was called.

Meche and San Luis Potosin I asked Gloria if she ware going to San Duis Potosi this year for the Holy Week tennis tournaments. She said that the had planned to do so but was unable to find some one to go with her at the last moment. Pepe did not want to go, and would not let her go by herself unless accompanied by several other women or by Meche. Meche refused to go saying she would have no fun if with her mother and planned to go to Corpus Christt by herself.

Pepe to Europe again. Gloria volunteered that she was annoyed with Pepe. She deplores his Jatin attitude about the double standard. She has been prohibitted to take several brief trips to various cities in Mexico to see friends and family. She is not welcome to accompany Pene on his trips. Yet he will soon take another month off to travel either to Europe or to South America. Gloria said that she has been waiting all these years for her children to grow up so that she could go with Pepe on his trips. Now that they are grown up, she finds that she still is expected to stay home.

Gloria watched carefully. Gloria must account for her time very carefully to Pepe during the day. And under no circumstances can she stay out after dark. Pepe apparently disapproves of Gloria working for me. He does not like the idea that she will be visiting businessmen throughout the city both in their offices and homes. He has expressed his disapproval, but Gloria has chosen to ignore it.

Wants to send Meche to U.S. Gloria wants to fight the attitude of superiority over women that Latin men have, but on behalf of her daughter, not herself. Gooria feels that she will never be able to enjoy anything close to equal treatment and consideration with Pope. But she feels that her daughter should escape from this Latin degradation. Two or three years working in New York or San Francisco is Gloria's dream for Mocho.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

No luck with business. Gloria seems very enthusiastic about working for me. Mot so much to help me, but to give herself an excuse to get out and do something. Further, she wants to determine whether she can actually do something other than raise children. She was married when very young and has never worked. She hopes eventually to start some business of her own. She probably wants to have a shops of some kind. Working for me is a trial for herself. She hopes to prove to herself that she can succeed in business and mecting people.

The approach she has been taking with my business has been unsuccessful so far. I have given her the one which is most time-consuming and one which I would not have been able to do by my self. There are other apporaches, but I have not outlined these to her as yet.

We discussed her approach and some modifications of it. We agreed to review her sales approach after the Holy Week and decide whether to proceed along different lines.

LOGINOV. P-11712

Discussion of val. Having completed our business I raised the matter of Val. I reminded her that I had explained to her some time ago that I was annoyed with Val's treatment of me in public, namely his flagrant attempts to recruit me in the presence of mutual friends. I told her that I still hadn't had a chance to talk to Val in private. I repeated that all I wanted to do was make it clear to him that I held him in great esteem as a person, valued his friendshin, was not interested in assisting his government, and wanted him to stop jeopardizing our friendship with his offensive approaches, whether subtle and implied or direct and coarse.

I told Gloria that I had planned to have lunch with Val today. I enjoy Val's company, rarely have a chance to chat quitely, don't like to eat luach by myself and looked forward to explaining to Val my position before he completely destroyed any chance for us to continue as friends.

Not aware of accident to Dmitri. I told Gloria that Val had excused himself from our lunch date due to an accident to his son. She did not know of any accident other than the dog bite the previous week.

Gloria said that his declining my invitation might have been an afterthought. That he did not want to hurt my hy being seen with me in a public place.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

Avoids "hurting" his friends. Gloria then told me that Val never accepted an invitation to have coffee with her or Fene or to dine out. He explained to her that it could hurt her to be seen with him. She gave an example of when she was invited to the ballet with Val and a group of friends.

After the ballet, Pove and Gloria invited Val to join them for dinner. Val declined. Pepe and Gloria went to the Hoyo 19. Shortly after they arrived, Val and a large number of embassy officers also arrived. Val steered them away from Pepe and Gloria. Shortly afterwards a man arrived, sat at a remote table and took notes while watching the Soviets.

Val works mornings only. Gloria mentioned that Val is in the embassy only in the morning. This was in response to my statement that I had tried to call the embassy and talk to Val to find out what had happened to Dmitri, but since he was out, I would call in the afternoon. She added that he of course works in the afternoon, but outside the embassy. I said "trying to buy gringos". She said "trying to convince Mexicans".

COMMENTS

It seems to me highly unlikely that Val is really concerned about the welfare of his friends seen with him. It seems quite clear that he considers Gloria and Pepe, and perhaps me, as potential assets. He does not want to be seen with us because we would lose our value to him. He told Gloria that they should confine their contacts to the French Club. This seems to confirm the suspicion that he believes that thesis a secure place to meet people.

It is possible that he checked with his colleagues and they were of the opinion that my choice of the Llave de Oro for lunch was too public, exposed us to too many Americans.

I feel that Gloria has served a very useful purpose in this matter. If she is working for Val, which I doubt, she is in a position to see that my business is indeed legitimate, time-consuming, and with considerable financial potential. Further, she is in a position to relay to Val my unwillingness to cooperate with him and his governemen and my threat to take the matter to the embassy if his harrassment continues.

CONTACT REPORT

FROM : Samuel J. KARTASUK

SUBJECT : Rafeel VIDIELLA Ruiz

1. A meeting was held from 1300 to 1445, 25 March 1969 in the Chalupes Resturant located on Reforma, one block test of Prado Norte

Next meeting is scheduled for 1630, 26 March 1969 at VIFS Restaurant on the Periferico, North of Fjercito Nacional.

2 I porked my car three blocks from the meeting site and arrived in the pren at 1255. Subject was already seated st a teble waiting. We had lunch and remained there talking until 1445. He mentioned how much ho appreciated the two books (in Russian) which I loaned him and said that he was nearly through with the last one. He said he would turn them over to VICTOR. (I had airesdy informed him that he would be meeting a man named VICTOR during my absence). He asked if we could obtain for him the three other books written by the same author who wrote "Cancer Ward". He said "Cancer *ard*" was the second book written by the author. The 1st book was "First Circle", the 2nd was Cancer ward, the 3rd was " ivans", and the last was "Easter ____".

He commented on how favorably impressed he was by the 2nd book. I said I would give VICTOR this information and I thought we could probably turn up with some of them,

2. INFORMATION CONCERNING LOGINOV (P-11,712):

Subject said that he has *not*. (definitely) talked to LOGINO in over two months, de thought it very strenge that LOGINOV hos not called him et ell. At the last meeting with loginov, LOGINOV told Subject that he was poing beck to Russi in July 1969, and that he would remain there for at least tho (2) years. LOGINOV said that he would probably then go to some other country but had no idea where, Subject did not call LOGINOV and invite him to ANDREAS party on 1 Xerch.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

75. 
Subject said that if LOGINOV received an invitation to ANDREA's party, that it might have come from CHIRNYSH (P-13.002). During his conversations with ANDREA, she never mentioned the fact that LOGINOV went to the party. She never told Subject exactly who went.

3. Concerning ANDREA CATANO: (P-1356)

About ten days ago ANDREA went to Commercial Mexicana to do the weekly grocery shopping. Subject dropped by her house while she was gone. Shortly after arriving at her house, she called home and he talked to her on the phone. She said that she had some problems at the store and asked if he could come down and bring some money. He went with her brother, and on arriving at the store found her in custody of two managers and A Policeman. They had caught her trying to walk out with a stolen jar of face cream (she admited it) and she did not have the money to pay for it. Subject talked to the managers, telling thom that she was just a young girl, etc., and convinced them to do nothing about it Rafael paid for the face cream and they took her home. (Rafeel thinks this is a very unusal side of her character that he has never seen before).

ANDREA has not mentioned CHIRNYSH to Subject since my laat report. Rafael said that he will begin to pump ANDREA for some further information (in a discreet way). As far as he knows, she has not seen CHERNYSH lately. (perhaps since the party on 1 March).

4. Concerning Rafaels MOTHER AND HER WORK AT THE EMBASSY: (11212 Janeiro (1.1913).

(I asked Subject several questions about his mother, but he dodged them. He seemed unwilling to discuss her, and after several tries I stopped pushing). Rafael said that his Mother has one particular student in Spanish (at the Embassy) who has repeatedly expressed the desire to meet and become friends with Rafael. His Mother likes the man (her student) and said that she will shortly invite him home for dinner so that he and Rafael can become acquainted. (Rafael by now is suspicious of any imbassy official who wants to become friends), The man is

# Script for meeting with Valentin

STATE OF REPORT: March 24, 1969

Reason for meeting. I find it very difficult to talk on the tennis court. Last Saturday was no exception. We are either playing tennis or surrounded by a group of our friends. There is something I've wanted to say to you, to make clear, for several weeks, and the only way I could be sure of having your undivided attention, in private, was this lunch.

Dr. Gomez luncheon, your offer of money. Several weeks ago, at Luis Gomez' house, you offered to give me a large sum of money if I could help you and your embassy. You made this offer in front of a number of our mutual friends.

I realize that your offer was not entirely serious-- but not entirely in jest. The more I thought about your offer, the more it bothered me, the madder I got. What you did was put me in a very embarrassing position. You suggested that I commit treason against my country, and you made the offer in front of our friends. The fact that I chose not to create a scene could have been interpreted by our audience as possible interest in your offer.

Not interested in your offer. In the event that you have any doubts, let me make it clear that I am not interested in your offer. I find the offer offensive and provocative.

Affection for Val. Both my wife and I like you and Alexandra. And my boys like Dmitri. We would like to maintain your friendship with you. But you are seriously jeopardizing that friendship.

Uninterested in politics. I am not interested in politics. I realize that this is your business. Well, that's your problem, not mine. I am a business man and devote all my time to business. Even so, I don't have time to learn all there is and all I need to know about doing business. Any spare time I have I will devote to learning more about business. I cannot afford the time to prepare myself for political discussions with you or anyone else.

Avoid religion and politics. Even when a discussion touches upon something about which I think I know enough to comment, I will not discuss politics or religion with friends. I do not believe it is possible to pursue those topics without upsetting someone. There are too many other things about which one can talk safely, tennis, gastronomy, girls, etc. Furthermore, I am a guest in a foreign country. I am grateful for the hospitality of this country. It is a wonderful place to live--a wonderful place to work. I will be ever more careful.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

mon to upset my gracious hosts.

Political opinions. Just for the record, let me make a few statements which I would never make in front of our friends--to avoid embarrassing you, to avoid creating a scene, to honor my resolution not to discuss politics.

1. Soviet imperialism, unjustified. I believe that your country is characterized by total-itarian imperialism--a system far more destructive than constructive--a system which is expert in taking away and destroying what others have created, but is incapable of producing creative ideas of its own.

2. UNITEDS STATES SYSTEM. I believe that the United States has produced the greatest political-economic system, the most (almost too) democratic system that man has ever seen.

3. Soviet responsibility for Viet Nam. The USSR is our enemy in Viet Nam. You supply 90% of the arms and money needed by the North Vietnamese. It is not a question of our withdrawing or ceasing the war; it is up to you to do so. The USSR is continuing the war. You know it and I know it.

4. SOVIET anti-semitism. The Soviets, you by your own confession, are anti-semites. Your role of support of the continued troubled state in the near east is unjustifiable and misanthropic.

5. BERLIN WALL. Unjustified and embarrassing to you.

6. CZECHOSLOVAKIA. Unjustified and embarrassing to you.

7. HUNGARY

8. PERU.

9. C-Minus mentality. You are like the student in a class who receives a near-failing grade. When questioned by his father, he answered that everyone else got D's. Your country has been getting near-failing grades in internal economics and external policies. You hope to see everyone else fail so that you don't look so bad.

This is just a sampling of some of my opinions. I am sure that you can argue many of these points. But I am sure that if I had the time I could document my opinions--you historically never can.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

I repeat, I am not interested in discussing policies with you or anyone else. I value your friendchan much to risk it that way. But there is something else at stake.

Risk to American businessman. Your provocative statements to me in public can make it difficult for me to do business here. I think there is a great opportunity here to do business, and I want to take advantage of it. You are jeopardizing this. I have studiously avoided political involvement here. You make such involvement inevitable.

Threat to go to embassy. If you continue to harrass me, I will go to the US Embassy and report your harrassment to the Security Officer. I will even ask to see someone in the CIA. And if I don't get satisfaction there, I'll go to the Mexican Foreign Office and tell them my story. I'll ask them to see that the harrassment is stopped and that I be protected from further provocations.

Would prefer not to do so. There are several reasons why I would rather not do all that.

1.  First. It would probably put you on the spot. This would serve no real purpose since someone else would simply take over your assingments. And I consider you a personal friend, and would not want to see you in turn harrassed by the Foreign Service or denied entry to the United States. I would hope some day you might be assigned to lhe United States and see it first hand.

2.  Second. I have had very little contact with the embassy. I have very little confidence in civil servants. They usually are working for the government because they could never survive in private business. This may or may not be the case in your own embassy. The exception that proves the rule is our economic section which I have found helpful on various occasions.

If I were to report you to the embassy, I would probably be harrassed by all the little functionaries far more that you have been able to do.

If the CIA knew that I had a Soviet for a friend, I am sure that they would have ail sorms of ideas about what I should say to you. This is one of the seasons I have never invited you to my home-- and probably never will. I do not want the CIA to know of our friendohio and to try to use it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 80

Unwilling to help CIA. I would not be willing to cooperate with the CIA for several reasons.

1. First. I don't think you people are really accomplishing anything of value. If the same amount of money that is now spent on espionage were diverted to competitive free enterprise, the standard of living of both countries would rise to levels where no one would have the time for the present suicidal foreign involvements. As a businessman I know that if you can't measure an activity in dollar profits, it should either be revised or discontinued.

2. Second. The end-result of doing business with the CIA would be to get you to defect to our side.

From what I know of you, and of life in the United States, you would not be happy in our country.

Oh, if you get in trouble somehow with your own people, by all means, offer your services to the CIA, but, please, leave me out of it.

But just for money, don't come to the US. They would probably offer you a fortune for your little secrets. The government has no idea of how to place a value on things and are delighted to spend the taxpayers money--fortunately I no longer pay US taxes--Mexican taxes are high enough. But don't do it. You wouldn't be happy. It's a great country. We have wonderful people. They'd probably do everything possible to make you comfortable, but you would never be happy.

If a CIA man ever offers you money to defect or to give up your few secrets, tell him to STICK IT UP HIS ASS. And that's what I'm telling you to do! STICK IT UP YOUR ASS!

DON'T WISH HIM LUCK. I realize that if you keep trying, someday you'll succeed. That nothing ventured, nothing gained. Someday you will find an American who will be willing to work for you. There is nothing you could ever give him that would make him really happy. For his sake, I don't wish you any luck.

# JECT: Valentin Logo
DATA OF INFORMATION: Narch 24, 1969, 1202-1205 hours.
PLACE ACQUIRED: Telephone call to my office.

Telephone call. Val called me at my office. I assume the call was from a public telephone boosh, since thero was considerable background noise of traffic. He would not identify himself a to my secretary, but said that he was a friend.

Invited me to drink. Val asked if it would be convenient for me to get together this afternoon for a drink. I checked my schedule and said that today would not be a good day. Instead I suggested that he be my guest for lunch on Wednesday.

Luncheon date. I told him to meet me Wednesday at 14000 hours at the Llave de oro.

There was much discussion about how to find the Llave de oro. He was not familiar with the restaurant, nor with the passage with its restaurants and shors. I had to explain that it was bordered by Liveryco., Genova, Londres and Insurgentes.

Camera not the reason. I assumed that val's call was going to be attributed to his interest in selling his camera through me. Therefore, I referred to ris camera and reminded him not to forget it. He said chat this was not the reason he called and that he really wasn't in a big hurry to sell it. He said he wanted to chat with me.

I told him to bring the camera anyway since I hai just this morning spoken to my friend who owns a camera, store and was sure I could dispose of his camara for him. He did perk up then and show some interest in the camera.

SUBJECT: Valentin Loguinov
DATE OF INFORMATION: March 22, 1969
PLACE ACQUIRED: French Club

Tennis: Val had come, probably thinking that my partner and I would complete our match with Val and Meche. I, however, was out of town this weekend. Meche went for it late way. Val and Gloria Pinto (the mother of Meche) were playing singles when I arrived. I had a singles tournament myself and did not join them until an hour later. We then formed a doubles group. I played with Pepe Pinto, and Val played with Gloria against us.

As is always the case, there is very little oportunity for conversation during a tennis match. Val did make a few stupid comments of apolitical nature, but entirely harmless, such as, addressed to me, haven't you any control over your friends the Grizax Chinese?

I did not get a chance to confront Valentin about his corvocative comments and how they jeopardized our friend- ship.

Val asked me if I had given any thought to his request the previous week. I could not believe that he was going to open the matter about his offering me money for "secrets". Therefore, I was genuinely stupid about what request. He remänded me that he had spoken of a movie camera he wanted to seil and which I had stated that I thought I could dis- pose of it for him through friends of mine, on consignment. I told him to bring me the camera and I would see what I could do.

I then told Val that there was something I had wanted to talk to him about anyway, land hoped we could get together sometime scon to do so. He stated that he would not come to the club tomorrow. He offered to take me to lunch sometime during the week.

This is not exactly what I had in mind for an informal and not too pleasant statement of my position about his apporach to me. But I feel it can be used and will achieve the desired effect. Unfortunately, he might spend the rext few days wondering if I am about to accept his approach.

Dmitri bitten by dog. The main topic of converstaion during the crier moments available between games or sets of tennis was Dmitri: Dmitri was bitten by the dog belonging to the Counselor of the Soviet Embassy. Apparently the bite was fairly deep in his right forearm and severed a large vein, hence there was much bleeding, probably an asset lunder the circumstances. The dog has been impounded to be watched for ten cays, to determine whtether Dmitri should unkemo rabies shomes or not. Val said that the dog had bitten four or five children already and that he, Val, would shoot eno dos when the ten days are up.

It is conceivable that this is a point of ricusch now for vai bacvuon hia Counselor and him.

PLACE ACQUIRED: Home of Ana Zuracusa (spalli..)

My wife and Ruth Wiegandt were present at a luncheon of women tennis players. In the course of their conversation they discussed the other mixed doubles group to which they both belong, including Valentin Dogusnow. My wife told Ruth that she was looking forward to having her turn of having the entire group at our home for lunch. But that we were waiting for Val to leave for Moscow. My wife said that she thought it ill-advised for an American to entertain a Soviet. Ruth agreed.

I GOT: GLORIA PIITO
2. I PORTO: March 12, 1979. 1400-1012 16.
HACE REQUIRED: Llave de Cro.
RATE OF REPORT: March 24, 1969

Commission acent. Gloria and I have been talking for some time about what the might do to keep herceir busy and make a little money. I offered to discuss the matter with her months ago to either to hire her my- self or find a job for her. This luncheon date was to explain to her what jbb I had for her.

Discussion of job. The first hour was narxx spent discussing the job I could offer her. This would in- volve her following up on a list of Americans and Englishton in the D.F. to whom I sent some promotional literature recently. These are potential clients for ono of the services of my business.

I gave Gloria a looseleaf notebook with conies of all my promotional literature to dato, including bounish translations of the pertinent literature. I also çave her a couple dozen envelopes with a complete set cach of literature and contracts.

She is eager to start. She wants to test her abil- ity to deal with people. Once she has built up her self- confidence she might leave me to shart her own business. We agreed that this would be boat for her, but in the meantime I was certain (and am certaini) that she would be able to find some clients for my business.

Confidential. Gloria asked me if I had told anyone, including my wife, about her possibly working for me. I said that I had not she prefers not to toll anyone un- til she knows if she is qualified or not.

Since that time, in recent days, it appears thet she lias not only told her family, but has been kidded about the job. Pepa even scolded her, saying that married women should not work. Gloria said she was simply ignoring his Latin attitude.

Mention of Val. Gloria mentioned Val first in an offhand comment about his departure soon for Ko

My comment about wal. I toid Gloria that Val had annoyed me the last time I saw him, two Sundays aso. I said I didn't know whether he was serious or just kiening. duc the more I thought about it, che e it bothered me. I finally decided that he right have been sariously offering me money for secrets betrayi country.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 85

of the things that she doesn't like about Valerian is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde behavior. Most of the time he is a very likeable guy, and suddenly he is nasty or do something provocative.

Gloria spoke in euphemisms and figures of speech, but Gloria did state that she is aware of Val's role as an intelligence officer. She seemed much more alert to this role than I had expected. I guess I really expected her to be naive about Val's intelligence activities. I even think I expected her to deny such activities had I been the first to mention or suggest them. Such was not the case. She referred to his activities and those of his friend Tchernich.

I was particularly surprised at her sophisticated attitude about Tchernych. I personally could have doubted his intelligence activities if I hadn't personally seen him conducting a clandestine meeting on a dark street corner in San Angel late at night.

I chose this opportunity to manifest a certain naivete on my part. I challenged her statement about Tchernych. I further stated that I doubted very much that the published reports were true that 70 percent of the Soviet embassy personnel were intelligence officers.

I said that Val was not the first Soviet that I had met. I said that I used to play chess with a Soviet quite regularly and that I knew he was not "one of those". Neither of us (Gloria and I) ever used any overt term such as "spy" or "intelligence officer", etc.

Gloria said that Val had offered her a lot of money to work for the Soviet embassy. She said she feels Val is miscast, that Moscow has made a very bad choice-he is too human, not cold enough for that kind of work."

Dr. Alfonso Martinez. Dr. Martinez is a communist and a school chum of Pena's. Gloria introduced Val and Martinez some two years ago. After this meeting they have been very close friends. He loans Val and the embassy his house in Tequesuitengo for weekend parties. His property includes a swimming pool, launches, dancing area, picnic area, house with several bedrooms, etc. Gloria was invited to this house this Sunday, March 30th.

Alexandra, better agent. Gloria said that she felt Alexandra had a better personality for that workable diplomat, colder, mature. Val is a little boy.

CONTACT REPORT

FROM : Samuel J. KARTASUK

12 March 1969

SUBJECT : Rafael VIDIELLA Ruis (P-4505)

A meeting was held from 1130 to 1430, 11 March 1969, in Chalupas Restaurant
on Ave, Reforma, one block west of Reforma and Prado Norte. The date and
hour of the next meeting will be established by telephone. Subject will pick
up Kartasuk on Reforma, in front of the anthropology Museum at a specified time.

1. I parked my car three blocks North of the Chalupas and walked to the
   meeting site arriving there at 1125. Subject was waiting at a table reading
   one of the Russian books I had previously given him. we met, talked, and conducted
   our meeting over a period of three hours and then parted company.

2. The initial conversation was general. He at first commented on how
   well he liked the two books he had received from me, and made some statements
   on the truth of their context, We ordered some breakfast and I then asked him
   if he would mind filling out the questionaire (PRQ) I had with me, explaining
   that it was merely routine. He readily agreed and I gave it to him and helped
   him fill it out. (PRQ submitted on 12 March). After completing the form I
   brought out a list of questins I wanted to ask and began going through them.
   He answered all of those he could, providing the following information:

Sady A. (FNU) MARTINEZ, OWNER OF THE PLAZA HOTEL:

Rafael does not remember MARTINEZ full name but promised to
obtain it at the first opportunity. MARTINEZ has a wife and son, The wife
originally comes from Santander, Spain. His son (no name remembered) is about
18 or 19 years of age, (8 years ago, now about 26) and at times was helping
around the desk of the hotel when Rafael was teaching his father Russian. (1960-
1961). Rafael gave MARTINEZ Russian for about 8 months, during which time
MARTINEZ learned to spook, and understand fairly well, RAMIREZ Aiver discussed
why he wanted to learn Russian with Rafael, nor did they talk poletica, either
Russian or anerican.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 87

When Rafael met PRIKNODKO (P-2270) at the Plaza Hotel, PRIKHODRO leter mentioned that he had some business with MARTINEZ concerning Tourists and Tourism, but did not expound on the Subject, MARTINIZ never discussed his association with PRINTODKO and Subject did not ask. During the latter part of 1962 Rafael wont to the hotel and by chance saw four or five Soviets in KARİliz office. Ho heard then talking, but did not go into the office. He thinks he has seen one of these Russians since but does not know the name of any of them. Martinez nover mentioned them or their business with him. In September 1968, just prior to the Olympics, Rafael went to see Martinez, trying to drum up some more private Russian lessons. MARTINEZ told him that he wasiready to take any more Russian lossons, but that he was very interested in learning German as soon as possible. Martinez said that he was currently (then) taking lessons, but that he did not like his teacher. (Did not say who his teacher was). Katsel offered to bring a teacher from his Institute, Martinez mentioned that the German Olympic team would be staying at his hotel. Shortly after Rafael brought a girl from the Institute named Gerda (LNU) to see Martines, while there they were invited to lunch and met thrée Mexican men and a tall German who said he was a representative of the german team. They had lunch, conversed about general things, and Rafael and the girl left. The girl later said that Martinez had continued taking Germ lessons from his old teacher. This was the last tire Rafael Saw MARTINEZ,
Rafael could supply no biographical data on Martinez, or any further informatio on any connections with Soviets. Subject has not heard any other Soviet mention either Martinez or the Plaza Hotel.

B. PELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOGINOV (P-11712) AND JUAN LUIS, DIRECTOR OF THE LANGUAGE INSTITUTE ON TIBER:

In about 1965 or 1966, LOGINOV went to the Instituto to take English lessons. He took lessons for about 6 to 8 months. The lessons were privato, but given at the Institute by an American girl narod Janet (LNU - Rafor? does ret remember ter lost neno, and sto is no longer thore). It was in this panner the not 100.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 88

JUAN LUIS mentioned to Rafael that he liked LOGINOV, and they seemed fairly friendly. It was at the end of this period that Rafael was introduced to LOGINOV by JUAN LUIS. When LOGINOV terminated his lessons he no longer visited the Institute. JUAN LUIS often sent his regards to LOGINOV via Rafael, and asked that LOGINOV come to see him. This was mentioned by Rafael, but LOGINOV continually told R-fael to "forget it", but did ask Rafael to return the regards. Rafael never questioned LOGINOV on why he did not go back to the Institute, but as far as Subject knows, LOGINOV has not been back. Rafael has had many discussions with JUAN LUIS but he has never mentioned any other Soviets in Mexico. As far as his politics go, JUAN LUIS is a confirmed Leftist in ideas but Rafael would not call him a Communist. Rafael believes that Juan Luis was merely a friend to LOGINOV and had no direct relations with him other than their association through lessons.

C. Andrea CATANO (P-13.546):

Andrea has mentioned to Rafael that she met CHERNYSH (P-13,042) at the Space Exhibit while she was working there. She also met several other Soviets there. She became friends with them and invited them to her house for a dinner party on two occasions. Rafael, invited by her, went on both occasions. On the first occasions there was a Russian woman, blond, about 36 years old named VALENTINA (LNU) who spoke very good spanish; a man named MISHA (LNU), supposedly an Electrical Tech from DUBNO Space Center near Moscow, about 37 years old and tall, who spoke excellent Spanish and who later wrote a letter to one of Andreas girlfriends in Mexico City (Not named); and BORIS (LNG). about 37 years old, thin, nervous but with a lot of vitality and personality. Boris spoke excellent Spanish also, and Rafael thought it very unusual that he drank American Whiskey and Coca-cola. (R-fael says this is unusual for Russians). Rafael thought MISHA a little suspicious, that he might be KGB (he knows that in cases such as this, no one is allowed to go anywhere with being accompanied by the KGB) because MISHA spoke excellent Spanish and seemed to be the only one who did not really fit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 89

The other Soviet was named VLADIMIR (LAW), about 57 years old, and did not speak any Spanish at all, but was very nice, according to Rafael, he was the only true Scientist there, (Also from Dubno).

At the second party the Russian women did not come, Andreas American boss from the Exhibit came however with a Mexican man, (Rafael does not remember his name). Rafael says he was a nice guy. He was about 43 years old, tall and smoked a cigar. He joked with the Russians and told them to be careful because Andrea was his spy. They all laughed. He came with two dark Mexicans and left shortly after dinner. Rafael said he drank a considorable amount and left drunk, CHERNYSH did not attend either of these parties. Andrea however invited him over on other occasions. On one occasion CHERNYSH brought another Soviet to Andreas who he said was a Military man. (No name mentioned by Andrea). Andrea said that this one was a pain in the ass because he was so serious it through the group (her mother also) into a depressed state. After the Exhibit CHERNYSH started calling Andrea at home and inviting her to meet him in various cafes, which she did. He cautioned her to never call him at the Embassy. He was invited to her house many times and often sat and discussed his politics (any all other topics) with her and her moth. Her mother took issue with his pol. Her mother liked CHERNYSH but does not know that Andrea is seeing him on the sl. She would not approve of Andrea going out with CHERNYSH at all. CHERNYSH began making amorous advances to Andrea and tried to talk her into going to bed with him. Andrea told Rafael that he is a very nice guy, she liked him, but was afr.

She said that he almost convinced her to go to bed, and that it is her decision that she is no longer going to see CHERNYSH for fear of doing so. Rafael had cautioned her about what she had to lose if she did. She continues to like CHERNYSH however.

Andrew had a party on 1 March and asked R-fael to invite LOGINOV.

CHERNYSH went to this party, Rafael did not bother to ask ICHINOV at all.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 90

Andrea hes often extended an invitation to LOGINOV through Setaol, but when
Rafael mentiones this to LOGINOV, LOGINOW has told him to forget it because
other people from his Embassy are seeing her and LOGINOV does not want to
appear there and cause trouble. LOGINOV did not expound and Refael did not
ask further explanation, Rafael thinks that CHERNYSH really wants to take
Andrea to bed, but he also thinks that CHERNYSH is up to other things also.
He has no idea whet, but just suspects.

3. The meeting with Rafael, after three hours, was cut short at this
   time because he had some obligations. His general daily schedule is as follows:

Monday: 1500-1600 Classes at the Institute, general.

5ummer, 1969

1. Agent: LIREALM/1
2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1200, 5/3/69; Reforma Hotel F/R.
3. Next Meeting: 1200, 12/3/69; Camino Real Hotel.

4. Reports/Information Given by Agent:

LIREALM/1 gave Rowton four pages for insertion into the HEFAIRY target notebook which he had previously prepared and turned over to the Station.

LIREALM/1 also gave Rowton a memo on his recommendations with regard to the oustanding balanace of the loan to LIKELIC (1,000.00 pesos), in which LIREALM/1 proposes to see LIKELIC once more and to obtain from him a receipt acknowledging the outstanding balance of the original loan.

A third report given to Rowton reveals what appears to have been an IS approach made to LIREALM/1 by Valentin Loguinov on 2 February, 1939, at the home of a mutual friend, Luis Gomoz. Loguinov again made reference to his previous allegations concerning LIREALM/1's affiliation with WOFACT but this time said that he was prepared to pay "a lot " of money for any information LIREALM/1 might obtain for him. L/1 reported to Rowton that he finessed as bent he could alleging that the only person he was close to in the WOLADY complex was an official in the economic section. LIREALM/1 commented to Rowton that he felt certain at this point that Loguinov was bluffing concerning his having actually seen L/1 with WCFACT officers "several times" in Sanborns, and that this was a prelude to an approach to LIREALM/1 that Loguinov had been planning for some time.

5. Administrative:

LIREALM/1 gave Rowton an accounting for his 1,500 peso revolving fund which showed a total of disbursements of 12,078.75. L/1 explained that this sudden increase in his expenditures was due to his new operations against the PARUKEN target. Ho stated that he expected the following recurring expenses every month:

C/ salary - 1,500.00
rental - 4.500.00
salary - 2,000.00
rental - 1,500.00
rental for spe - 1.500.00
miscellaneous - 1,000.00

p-11712


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 94

2. 
Since these recurring expenses would be a minimum of 12,000.00 pesos per month, LIREALM/1 requested that his revolving fund be increased from 1,500.00 to 12,000.00, and that Rowton, in addition to reimbursing him for the 9,078.75 he spent in excess of his last advance, give him an additional 12,000.00 pesos as his new revolving fund so that he would be able to pay the operational expenses required.

6. Guidance/Information Given to Agent:

Rowton agreed with LIREALM/1 concerning the approach of Loguinov and promised to give L/1 Station guidance on his future relationship with Loguinov. Rowton asked L/1 to move very cautiously with regard to implicating the WOLADY economics officer before receiving specific guidance from the Station.

Rowton promised to refer the request for an increased revolving fund to the Station in the hope of having the necessary money at the next meeting.

DATE OF INFORMATION: February 2, 1969
PLACE ACQUIRED: Iarty at the home of Dr. Luis Gomez.

Our tennis group meets occassionally at each others
homes, for lunch, dinner, or just drinks. Luis Gomez
invated us this time to his home in Xxay Pedregal for
lunch.

After I had made a point of not sitting near val,
several women wanted to change places and Val and
another person changed places putting Val next to me.

He opened the old issue by saying that he assumed
I was working for the company. He said that he had seen
me personally" several times" at Sanborns with American
inteligence officers. I asked who he saw me with. He
avoided the question. I then volunteered that it must
have been Bill Spruce, with whom I frequently have
lunch, He asked what section Spruce was in. I answered
the economic. He seemed disgusted, and sååd Spruce
wasn't worth anything.

Val then said that he wanted me to know that he
was prepared to pay a lot of money for any information
I might obtain for him. I said I'd talk to Spruce about
it and see if he had anything to seal so that I could
take my commission. I added that Spruce would probably
faint or tremble with terror--this pleased Val greatly.

I then asked Val if the Americans had ever offered
him any money for his information. lhe averted my eyes
and answered "not yet".

COMMENTS

Val is an ass!!

"Several xmas times" is, of course, inaccurate
and shows that he is guessing. It seems very unlikely
that he saw me even the one time.

Val probably regrets that we have not approached
him. But he is saxxxupid not so stupid that he does
not realize that we know he has no trade, profession,
skills, or talents which would make life for him ary-
where outside of Russia and government service possible.
Val is doing the only thing he knows how, and he knows
it, and he must realize that we know it. Hence, defection
for him is out of the question. He would only make a
short-term profit in doing so.

I have invited Bill Spruce to lunch this week. I
will develop him as my excuse and answer for any further
provocations by Val. Spruce, incidentally, is a very
clever and helpful person. My last meeting with him was
two years ago and I am still benefitting from his advice.
He has since transferred to the finance section, but
this should not affect his value to me and my cover.

DATE OF INFORMATION: February 1, 1969. 1200 hours.
PLACE ACQUIRED: French Club

Interest in American School. Val asked me if I could recall the address of the American school. He will call me for xx it. He wants to have his son Dmitri par- ticipate in some activities with the children at the school in order to learn English. Dmitri finishes school at the Russian embassy at 1400 hours. Val hopes that maybe there are some afterschool activities such as football for Dmitri.

COMMENT

This may be just val's inate stupidity. Maybe he really couldn't find the American School in the tele- phone directory.

Perhaps Val already knows of some after-school activity of which I am unaware. Maybe he already knows that someone'B child is there, someone he wants to meet. Perhaps he wants an excuse to wander about the school, meeting people.

Perhaps Val couldn't care less about the school. Per- haps he is hoping for an excuse to call me, suggesting our chiidren practice English together. Perhaps he is preparing the ground fexto go to somcone else he already has in mind to explain that there is no convenient program of after- school activities for Dmitir. He might ask that person to agree to have Dmitit play with his children.

It just occured to me that for the first time in many months Valentin spoke Russian to me. While I was playing tennis he shouted to me in Russian, "You really are playing with your left now". And later, "You look tired". When I answered that I was and that I had a head-ache, He looked particularly pleased. Normally he doesn't even answer my Good Morning in Russian. Perhaps he is preparing the xxxxx way for me to suggest an exchange in language lessons: he helps me with my Russian and dix my boys play with Dimi in English.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

3 FEBRUARY 1969

SUBJECT: Valentin Sergeevich LOGINOV (P-11712)

Attached are five LIEMBRACE Soviet Target of Opportunity reports which cover the period 12 December 1968 which was the first surveillance to four follow-up surveillance reports on the first one. On 12 December 1968 the LIEMBRACE team picked up LOGINOV in Colonia Buenos Aires in the company of an unidentified Mexican man. The LIEMBRACE team followed the Mexican man, who got into a Renault Dauphine with placas 350 HS. A LIKAYAK check revealed that the placas were listed to

Ignacio VALLINA Barros and Susana de VALLINA Fabre

Address: Adolfo Prieto 1302, Mexico 12, D.F.

A further LIKAYAK check revealed that the VALLINAs did not live at this Adolfo Prieto address and no further action was planned.

On Thursday, 2 January 1969, LIEMBRACE-5 went into Sears Department Store on Ejercito Nacional and thought that the store detective was identical to the man spotted with LOGINOV on 12 December 1968. LIEMBRACE-14 said that although the store detective looked alot like the man seen with LOGINOV, he wasnot 'identical. Photos of this store detective are attached.

On Friday, 3 January 1969 the LIEMBRACE team went to Sears Store on Ejercito Nacional to check out this store detective. The people at Sears said that if a name were given to them, they would cooperate.

On Thursday, 9 January 1969, the LIEMBRACE team picked up the store detective as he was leaving work. The store detective went to a house at Lago Chiem 142-A. Prior to that he went to an address at Avenida Claveria 84-1.

On Friday 10 January 1969 the LIEMBRACE team gave us the result of a check at these addresses. They are the following:

This information is for the file. No concrete results of the LIEMBRACE check were obtained, as the man who got into the Renault with placas 380 HS does not appear to be identifiable with the Sears store detective.

He was very much in favor of the writers who have been suppressed in Russia. Subject said that when he first arrived in Mexico his major desire was to visit a book store. When he managed to visit one he was amazed at the variety of literature for sale which was absolutely banned to Russians. He could not help feeling nervous while in the bookstore, and later cried when he got home. (Due to the emotions he felt). At the first opportunity he began buying and reading all of the books he could afford. It took him a long time in order to be able to sit in a public area and openly read a book without feeling some kind of fear.

As regards to Cuba he has heard conflicting stories, he believes that Castro has done some good for the Cubans, (by raising their standard education level), but that from stories he has heard, the Cubans had a much higher economic standard of living (than Mexico) prior to the Castro regime. He has often discussed these politics with LOGINOV. In a crowd LOGINOV tends to say good things about Castro and the Cuban regime, but when alone with Subject LOGINOV sneers at Castro and condemns the regime. This attitude leads Subject to believe that the official Soviet attitude (real attitude) towards Cuba is one of disgust. During discussions in a group, LOGINOV has stated that they (Soviets) are not in favor of Guerillas operating in Central and S. America. He has repeated this while privately talking with Subject.

During part of the conversation I began telling him about the standards of living in the U.S. and what it might be like living there. We discussed different parts of the U.S. in terms of Geography and what it had to offer. Subject repeated that his wife always thought that it would be divine living in the U.S. and that he still had hopes of going there in the future to live.

During about May or Ju, 1949 not sure, + was in Russia-
Offering standards living there, a Soviet prospect, and mother acting as the
Russian Precent. Every three months they had to go (individually) to an
office with initials -O.V.I.R. (Department of Visas and Registry for foreigners)
to pick up a slip of paper from the here, who was an old Russian Colonel.
They then took this slip of paper back to the apartment where they loved and
presented it to the person in charge of the apartment. The person then wrote
on the slip that they had permission to live there for three months. They
returned to the O.V.I.R where the Colonel stamped it and put his initials. This
had to be done every three months. Whenever they traveled they had to take this
slip with them. Subject thinks that their travel was limited to 300 or 600
kilometers, but is not sure. He said the Colonel became a good friend of his
and later advised him not to get a Soviet passport since it might limit his
traveling in the free world. Prior to leaving Russia he was not interviewed
by anyone or offered any deals.

He has known LOGINOV about 3 years. He was introduced to LOGINOV
three years ago by JUAN LUIS, the director of the Language Institute (where
Subject now works). After the introduction they went to the Director's apartment
on Hamburgo for drinks and he became friendly with LOGINOV. Prior to about 6
months ago LOGINOV had merely been a friend, but had insinuated that Subject
offer information on his students. In the past six months LOGINOV has made
about three direct offers, outlining that Subject presents and give him personal
information on his students, especially those who might be in a position to go
to the States. (He wants the usual personal information, including their attitude
towards Americans). Subject has refused LOGINOV on each occasion. He said that
he did not attend the meeting arranged for Saturday, 1 February, because he
slept late and was not interested, he had previously said that the meeting
was on the corners of PRAGA and RAFORK; but during this meeting he said he
was in error the meeting was suonored to be on the corners o INIG and

that LOGINOV had told him several times never to call him or visit him at the Embassy. LOGINOV usually calls Subject when he wants to meet him.

During the first year after their arrival in Mexico, he recommended his mother to the Soviet Embassy, and while there met a (FNU) BROWN who was an old friend who had met his mother in Russia. While talking to BROWN, they asked if he had any jobs for Subject, or know of anyone who might employ Subject. BROWN said No, but later introduced Subject to CHICHKOV, who gave him a job.

Subject met PRIKHODKO in the Plaza Hotel (See previous Contact Report). PRIKHODKO was there to meet the owner, and after they (He and PRIKHODKO met) talked by the phone booth they went to the bar to meet the owner. The owner did not show up and they then went to PRIKHODKO's apartment where Subject stayed for dinner. While there he met CHERNYSH. Subject said that CHERNYSH did not ever try to recruit him for anything (He said that I must have mis-understood him during the previous meeting. CHERNYSH is playing around with ANDREA, who can go to the "S. anytime she wants. He said I must have mistaken him). CHERNYSH is about 37 years old and ANDREA just turned 17. ANDREA has told Subject that she has kissed CHERNYSH on several occasions and really likes him. Subject is very angry about this and says that CHERNYSH has no business picking in ANDREA, and he knows that CHERNYSH (Suspects) is up to no good. Subject would like to put a stop to this but does not know how. (I use this as an arguement but to no avail).

PRIKHODKO is a friend of Engineer (FNU) MARTINEZ, who owns the hotel PLAZA and the HACIENDA VISTA HERMOSA. MARTINEZ is now about 62 years old. Subject tought MARTINEZ Russian about 8 years ago and has not seen him since. During this time he also taught a man named Miguel MORA, a Mexican who has since visited Chermanya Russia.

SUBJECT: Gloria Pinto
DD OF INFORMATION: January 31, 1900, 2100-0200 hours.
PLACE ACQUIRED: Restaurant Nomandia, Niza.

A group of ten of us celebrated New Year's Eve together.

Business at Soviet onhiasy. Gloria wants to purchase & Persian Lamb coat. Alexandra Doguinov. Sas one she would be willing to sell, but Gloria believes it would be too hot for Mexico, having been lined for Moscow weather. Gloria thinks that the commercial counselor of the Soviet embassy would be interested, willing, and able to help her in obtaining a Soviet coat.

Gloria also wants to open a shop. She thought that maybe she could handle imported Soviet goods. Her children are now old enough to take care of.. themselves. She feels unneeded, hence the interest in opening a shop. She has checked with the camino Real and learned that shop space rents for 12000 pesos per month. She would probably work for someone else for a while to learn the problems involved, before opening her own shop. She admits to very little education. She has never worked in her life.

Wants help from me. The last time I saw Gloria she reminded me that on New Years Eve I promised to give her problem some thought, Frankly, there is something she could do for my cover business. I need someone who is attractive, mature, but not necessarily very intelligent, and not necessarily very experienced, to contact potential clients, to sell a service. I think Gloria could fit this requirement. I had in mind a commission agent: someone who would recieve no salary, but would receive a percentage each month (20%) of the income due to clients she obtained. Let's say she would bring me 100 clients over a period of two or three years. Let's say further that cach client would represent an income of $250 peces per month. She would receivé 20 x 250 x 100 = 5000 pesos per coach as long as those clients continue. and whether she continued to work for me or not. She could work as little or as much as she wanted, though I would probably set a cuota of eno new client per week. she would and as the year 2600 peses per month, averaging 1300 pesos נוכת כעת over the year. She has her own car. I wouldproba reimburse her for gasolino and entertainment cx- peases.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

I mention this in soms detail because I think it really would suit Gloria and would help my business. If I used her, it would probably preclude her use wittingly against the Soviets. Further, before using hot, some thought ought to be given to the possibility that she might already be working for the coviets (which I doubt) and could be targetted against me.

Soviets interest in Gloria. I would not attempt to explain why the Soviets might be interested in Gloria as a target. My guesses would be a waste of time considering that the Soviet section has probably given this sort of thing a great deal of experienced thought. I do believe that Valentin and Gloria might be having an affair for strictly personal and non-operational reasons. I further believe that Valentin might actually be paying his own way at the French Club to pursue a sport he is fairly good at and enjoys--and not as an excuse to go to the French Club to find potential recruits.

Our interest in Gloria. I can see a possible use of Gloria if recruited by false Mexican secret service. The scenario would go something like this:

We (the Mexican secret service) have observed that she (Gloria) has been seen in the company of Valentin. We know Valentin to be a very dangerous and destructive person to Mexico.

Would she be willing to report on Valentin, his personality, his views, his activities as far as she is aware of them.

(Later) Would she be willing to make comments which would encourage Valentin to try to recruit her. Such comments would be that she has met diplomats from various embassy, knows students who are anarchists and communists, is growing more and more disappointed with the U.S. foreign policy, especially since that imperialist Nixon has taken over, etc.

CONTACT REPORT

FROM : Samuel J. KARTASUK

SUBJECT : Rafa-1 VIDILLIA aute; contact with on 29 January 1969.

1. KARASUK Lert his car in a parking lot in the Zone Rosa and welked to the vicinity of Sanborns on Reforms and fiber. At 1455 I called the Language school where Subject teaches and was told that he had not you arrived for class. I called again at 1:05 and was informed that he was already in clees. At 1545 I began waiting in front of the Language school for Subject to come out, He came out at 1610 and we walked towards Sanborns. I invited him to go to La Mansion Restaurant on Insurgontes Sur but he said that he had a class scheduled from 1630 to 1800. Wo wont to the Sonborns bar and had a drink. I told him that I thought that two girls I had proviously mot wore going to meet me at the La Mansion at 1700 and that I wanted him to go with me. After some discussion he decided that he could postpone the class until-Friday, but would have to wait until 1630 for the pupil to arrive, in order to inform hor. We left the Bar at 1630 and encountered the student by the magazine stand. Subject made his excuses, and we started walking to his car. (Subject had not wanted to miss his class, and after some discusion in the bar, he offered me his car in order that It go to La Mansion and get the girls. I told him that I also wanted to est, and that there was a possibility that the girls would'nt show up. He finally corsented after some consideration).

We arrived at La Mansion shortly before 1700 and went inside, lervi the car parked in the Restaurant lot. After sitting don and ordering dricks and a steak, I told him that I would like to discuss a few important item thet had a lot do to with his future. (I had mentioned during the previous meeting that I had some business to talk to him about). I began by telling him that in our relationship I had neglected to mention somethine important : 10 that meeting him in casules was not an accident, had gone there for express payoss of meeting after considerile planning. Subject just art there with a cria anused Soc. on his son hade if I were the .3.3.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

or the Police, or something. I said "No. I'm an Intelligence Officer for the
U. S. Government", and showed him my I. D. card. He looked at it, raised his
eyebrows, but never changed the expression on his face. (From the look on his
face, one might think he was watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon). I said that our
files show that for some years he has considerable contact with members of the
Soviet KGB. Before I could go any further he stated that he was not a member
of the KGB. nor did he ever work for them. I said that that was what we believed.
and that was also why I wanted to talk to him. I had a proposition to make to
him. Before I could continue, he said that he had often been approached (Currently
and in the past) by the KGB to work for them. At present he is being hounded
by Valentin (LOGINOV) to report on his Mexican friends. He considers the KGB
to be a bunch of Basterds (Cabrones) and that he does not believe in all of this
under the table spying, nor does he believe in what the KGB are trying to do.
and if I'm involved in this work, and I am asking him the same thing, then I'm
the same kind of bastard that the KGB are. He said for some time now, LOGINCV
has called him, met him, and asked that he (Subject) spot Mexicans (students)
who are either going to the U.S. or look like they might be promising in that
respect, and that he (Subject) prepare biographical data and other details
about their current life, and arrange for them to meet LOGINOV at parties, etc.
LOGINOV, during each meeting with Subject, brings an envelope with 500 pesos in
cash in it, and continually offers this to Subject. Subject says that he
does'nt say yes or no, but that to date he has not furnished any information and
has not accepted any money. He likes his friends and students, and any cooperation
with LOGINOV (along these lines) would make him feel like a Judas. Besides,
these students are young, and nice people, and the KGB basterds should keep their
hands off them. He said that he appreciated the fact that I immediately showed
him an official I.D. card and declared myself, because LOGINOV did not ever have
the decency to do that, LOGINOV has never showed him anything at all (in I.D.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 115

and never oven extended the courtesy of telling him why he wanted the information on Mexican students, but Subject knows LOGINOW is KGB and doesn't appreciate the approach by LOGINOW. IF LOGINOW had approached him honestly, shoved him I.D. and talked about the idealism involved in what he wanted, Subject might have paid more attention, but he (Subject) did not like the dishonest way LONGINOV went about it, offering money and trying to con him. Subject said, granted, he needs money, and the 500 pesos always looks good. but that if he started doing what LOGINOV wanted, the sight of the money would make him sick afterwards. I told him that we were not interested in his students, but that we wanted to stop the KGB in their efforts to undermine other nations and direct sabotage against the U.S. he might not like the idea of under-the-table dealing, but it was a real fact of life. If it were not for the current under-the-table conflict, the world would probably be rushed into a nuclear war, and he know what that meant, what was going on in the espionage field was actually a deterrent, and that the people involved were composed of the best minds of two worlds. I recalled his (Subject) two world powers opinions (previously expressed by him) and asked him what he planned to do. He couldn't return to Russia; his current future prospects in Mexico were not too promising, and he had previously mentioned that he wanted to go to the U.S. If it's true that there are only two important powers in the world, then he had better seriously consider where he wants to place his marbles. Opportunity doesn't knock every day. and he was talking to a representative of the U.S Government at the moment, who was making a proposition directly to him (Subject). Subject said that that was all true; he at first wanted to return to Russia but after seeing some things in Mexico he realized that he could never be happy in Russia again because of the oppressive regime and the lack of freedom. (He cited the recent Russian invasion of the Checks and said that it made him sick to see the Russians do this). He said that he was not happy in Mexico but that he could live here O.K.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 116

He had previously tried to go to the U.S. but had been turned down. In any case, he had made friends here, and this was his life, and he has no intention of either screwing his friends or being an informer, either for the KGB or for their U.S. equivalent. The first person he has to live with is himself, and the realization that he is a spy against his own friends would be enough to mentally ruin him, regardless of any money received. I told him that one of our efforts is trying to block the KGB when they go after people that turn out to be his friends. He can think that he (Subject) is not involved, but that is far from the truth. He may not work for the KGB, but his associations with them have been known for some time and that a thick file already exists on him. I know him personally now, and like him, and if he refuses to work with me I'm obligated to write it up that way. My superiors will later sit down with me and ask the results, and I'll tell them that Rafael is a nice guy, honest, sincere, and I firmly believe that he is completely honest. This however will not answer the question why he will not cooperate, and when it is put on paper it will just be a cold report lacking personality, and the paper will indicate that he might be working for the KGB regardless of any opinions tacked on to the bottom. In a case like this, protocol between the U.S. and Mexican Governments require that we eventually turn over to them any reports on people in their country who might be involved with the Russians in efforts against Mexico. In his case, his file would be turned over to the Mexicans and then he can imagine what could happen. By the time the Secret Service stopped harassing him, or he wound up in jail, he would by living a miserable life. All this just for being innocent. For this reason, and for reasons involving the fact that as a real person in a real world he can't afford just to sit on the middle of the fence, he should seriously consider my proposition.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

Subject said that what I mentioned sounded like a threat, and that if it was, it still wouldint make ary differences ho would rather go to  or be harrassed by the police then to cooperate, either with us or the KCS. I told him : what said was not a threst but a reality, and that he should conrecisto the fact that I'm being frank with him instead of trying to do what LOGINOV did, to con him. I was only asking.. I was a friend remordless what his decisions, and that if its "No", then I'll do everything in my power to see that he cmains untouched and un-bothered, but that I can't gerunted anything because a bureaucratic structure was involved and I didnt have the final sey. I told him that unless everything he had told me during our previous associction was complete D.S...then ho had a duty to at least consider what I was asking. (By now we had been at this from 1700 to about 1930). Finally he asked me what I would want of him. I said that I wanted him to work with me directly against the KGB and that I had no interest in his friends or students at all. If ho was concerned about the AGB bastards bothering his friends, this ves his chance to help me do something about it. We can't operate alone. He hos the intelligence, the ability and the opportunity to do a great derl and he should involve himself. if only for the ideals that he has previously expressed. (He thought about it for a few moments and began to talk about Yuriy CRNYSE). He said thet for instance CHERAISE was snother KGB man who had approsened him to report on Americans, LOGINOV had told him that he (LOGINOV) couldnt get along with Americans and consequently was only interested in working with Mexicans, but CHERRYSH tried to recruit Subject to work against Americans. Subject refused. CHERNYSH however was trying to work on ANDREA (Subjects friend) and this made him damned med. The girl ANDREA was only about 16 or 17, and a sweet little girl, and they (KGB) hed no business trying to pick on her: Subject said that he was in the Plaza hotel ore day waiting to make a phone call, and that he heard the man in the phone booth speaking fluent Russion, then the man for through Sgbjret asked him in Russian he was from the labrasy. The man gave his ne and said that he was theist Secretary and asked Subject is his awe was l


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

The 1st Secretary said that he recognized Rafael because he had seen his picture. During the conversation the Secretary asked Rafael over to dinner that night and he accepted. When Rafael arrived, he was introduced to CHERNYSH who made overtures of Friendship which later led to the attempted recruitment. In the meantime Rafael had introduced CHERNYSH to ANDREIA and now regretted it. (This led into further conversation about the KGB and I asked him about CHICHKOV). He said that he has worked for CHICHKOV but that he had no idea that CHICHKOV was KGB. CHICHKOV had never made any attempt to recruit him for anything. He later mentioned that he might know VOSKRESNIKOV by first name, but could not be sure of the last name. (I didn't try to describe him). Subject mentioned other Soviets who are KGB during fast moving conversation but I did not take notes. My aim was the recruitment and I tried to keep the conversation channeled towards that end. During the conversation Subject said that at one time his mother had confided in him that they had tried to recruit her several times in Moscow to work against Spaniards and Latin Americans who visited. The KGB had once threatened her but when she combined that she would consult her husband, they told her to forget it. He said that she had known many members of the NVD, NKVD and now KGB, but that she still refuses to work for them in their business.

After considerable more discussion along the same lines. Subject finally thought a bit, and said that he would agree to work with me on one condition only. The condition was that I would not ask him to inform on, or work against, any of his friends or students, including COIL, VENTURA or ANDREIA in particular, and that if any thing should happen to him as a result of his work for me, that I would promise to take care of his wife and child. I agreed to his condition, restating that my only concern was the KGB. I said however that in the future if I could prove to him, or convince him, that any of his local acquaintances were directly involved with the KGB then I would expect him to help me.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 119

He said that was fair enough. He said the they rey, he had a Restaurent date with LOGINOV at 1530. He was to meet LOGINOV at a Mariacos Restaurent on the corner of Ave REFORMA and PRAGA. He wanted to know what he should do with LOGINOV. I told him to be very careful that he doesent change his attitude one bit, and to continus for the time, being with LOGINOV Just os if nothing at all had happened. I said that the Soviets do have a dopertzent... at this he interrupted and seid "SMERSH" and grinned. I said yes, they do oporate now and then, and that the Soviets would not be very hapey to discover that their friend hd anything at all to do with us. I said that even though we treat each other as gentlemen. they are capable of being tough at times. He said not to worry, that he was an excellent actor, and LOGINOV would never suspect a thing.

During the time I was trying to convince him, he said that I wes forgetting one thing. He assured me that he was SC Socialist and 20% capitelist. and he firmly believed that Socialism was good for some countries, including Russie. He said that because of thet he didint see how I could ever have any confidence in him. I answered by saying that everyone was entitled to their ideals, and I too believed in certain forms of Socirlism. The encouraging thing was that he believed in something, and that was his right as an individual. we in the U.S are entitled to our beliefs, and are not restricted in our reading metter or what we said on street corners. If he wanted to, he could stand on the steps of the Lincoin monument and give a speach on socialism and no one would bother him provided he didint cause a riot, disturb the Deech or break some local law. We have Socialists who are still good citizens. He then talked a little about the restrictions in Russi in reading matter and talking, but saw my point.

by 2115 we were in agreement on his cooperation with me involving the above mentioned conditions. I asked him to rect me on Wednesday, 5 February, at 1.030 &t CHALUPAS Restaurant on Reforma (just across the Poriferico). Es know where it was and agreed to mect mo. I cautioned him again to be very careful in his dealings with LOGIKOV and to take precantiere the saro to the meeting.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 120

Just prior to leaving the restaurant he said that after this he was going out and get drunk. (I don't remember where he said he was going, but it might have been COMS). In cautioning him, he his said that he would not say a word, even to his mother or wife. He left the restaurant at 2145. He wanted to give me a ride, or have me go get drunk with him, but I said that even though I wouldn't mind it, that three of my associates were waiting about three blocks away for my report, and that I had to tell them what happened...they were very anxious about this. He parted in the doorway and he drove off as I walked in the other direction. I later caught a cab to town and left it in the vicinity of my car.

REMARKS:

During the conversation Subject mentioned the names of various Soviets, but I was not taking notes and proferred to channel the conversation back to the recruitment pitch. I thought the details could be obtained later if he was recruited.

During the pitch the only one who was nervous was me. Subject displayed a "cool" which was amazing. When I presented my credentials and the pitch he never batted an eyelash...just continued slightly smiling. I noted no reaction at all. It could be that he still thought I was kidding, or playing some game. In any case, either he works for the other side, or he is indeed cool to an admirable point.

We (I) talked from 1700 to about 2030 without making any headway.

Up until that time I had gotten an emphatic "NO". I almost gave up before another approach produced a little result. I think that prior assessments which state that he will do anything for money is entirely false. At the moment the recruitment is still on thin ice, and subject is serious about involving his friends. Perhaps after he gets his feet wet (if it lasts that long) and has some experience he can be brought around to do almost anything.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

21

e the meantime however I would be very careful not to cast any reflections on his friends, (left or not) the Russian people, Republican Spaniards in general, or anything else that he ...s expressed a definite opinion on. If all of the foregoing is-really legitimate, the success of the recruitment so far has been due to friendship and my willingness to see just about everything his way. This will take time to change.

SUBJECT: LIREALM-1's Soviet Contacts at the French Club

1. Without encouraging any further contact between LIREALM-1 and the Soviets but simply taking advantage of the fact that he does continue to see them, I would appreciate continuing information on the following points:

a. Anything new learned about the activities of LOGINOV and CHERNISH, even the fact that they were at the club for certain hours on certain dates, with whom they played tennis or talked, etc..

b. Any indications that either LOGINOV or CHERNISH have any interest in anyone at the club.

c. Continuing assessment and biographic data on Gloria PINTO and her husband with the view of approaching both or either.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT : BESASER (P-8777)

DATE OF MEETING : 22 January 1969

1. Following a phone call from Subject, I met him at his hotel room for lunch. The meeting lasted from 1435 until around 1600. The next meeting will be arranged by phone when Subject is back in Mexico City.

2. During the past month, Subject was all with flu and, following recovery, spent all of his time on business matters rather than on subjects of operational interest. As usual, he is up to his ears in financial woes, though he just discovered that his position is not nearly as bad as he thought.

3. Subject said he thinks Polish Ambassador MAJCHRZAK may come to visit him in Cuernavaca this Sunday, though plans are not definite. I urged him again to get busy courting NAJ, a bit moreaggressively and not to let the relationship grow cold. Subject said that the reason he has not been more active lately is that Lolita is in the early months of pregnancy and has not been feeling up to any large-scale entertaining.

4. Yesterday afternoon, 21 January, Subject ran into Valentin LOGINOV at Florencia and Hamburgo. They exchanged brief greetings and LOGINOV commented "We have had a very good beginning of the year." (whatever that means).

5. Subject recently received a post card from BEWEEP advising that BEWEEP has seen Subject's sister in Warsaw. Nothing more than this other than routine greetings.

1. The undersigned met with LIROBIN/1 and 2 at the LIRODIN apartment on 4 December from 1215 to 1300 hours. The next meating will occur when one of the LIROBIN's contacts REIDEMANN via telephone.

2. LIROBIN/2 reported that both of the LIROBINS attended a cocktail party at the home of the Indian Embassy Counsellor, FNU PARASHAR, at which they met the LOGINOV'S (P-11712). LOGINOV again refused to carry on any of the conversation in English even though English was the common language used by the guests. At one point during the evening, Mrs. PARASHAR addressed LOGINOV in front of all the guests and chided him for not using his English remarking that"everyone here knows that you speak English". LOGINOV stared at her icily, but did not comment in either Spanish or English. LOGINOV spoke briefly with L/1 inquiring what L/i's duties were with the newspaper and gave every indication that he was unaware of L/l's column. Mrs. LOGINOV was quite cordial and inquired if L/2 had been to the film festival in Acapulco. L/2 replied that she had not to which Mrs. LOGIKOV countered by remarking that she had seen L/2's friends - the SARATOVS (P-13125)- at Acapulco. L/2 stated that no effort was made to involve the LOGINOV's in polemics during the evening and that LOGINOV did not appear to know the majority of the approximate 16 guests who represented almost every nationality. The LIRCBIN's were the only Americans with the exception of Edward KENEDY and his Mexican wife. LOGINOV did not spend an inordinate time with any particular individual nor did they remain lato.

ancia: Moria and in-a

GOORIA'S ZEROsure. There seems to με το izm evidence that loria is interested in "al other than socially and for soapis.

Gloria is a very attractive and vivacious woman of 40 cr 45 years. She is the center of gravity of a croup of tennis enthusiasts, rancing in age from Péche, Gloria's daughter of 19 or 20 to Licenciado Preciado (a deputy from PAN) of perhaps 65 years or more. It is doubtful that Gloria would encourage an affair with Valentin. Her in- terest in val is probably that of everyone else's, as a Soviet, he is a novelty. He is also probably attractive to women who like brutish mon. Gloria, żx however, is married to a very soft-spoken and considerate person.

EXTENT OF SOCIAL CONCCUESE. It seems likely that Val and Gloria and their families have come together socially at intervals. It is doubtful that they are intimate friends, but likely that they (the Pintos) are the closest friends that al has among the Mexicans.

VAS'S INTEREST IN GLORIS, Val's interest in Gloria is probably more complex than har interest in him. First, he probably has entertained the possibility of an affair with Gloria, val has spoken Frequently of his interest in girls. Glória could easily be a sexual target for Val-- self-appointed, of course.

Further, Gloria organizes tennis groups and informal tournaments. Through her val is likely to meet a number of Mexicans.

It seems highly unlikely that Wal would try to re- cruit either Gloria or Pepe. They enjoy a fairly luxorious life, Bere being a fairly successful physician. Neither Pene or Gloria take life seriously enough to become in- tellectual communists. Philosphy is certainly not their reading of choice during idle hours. Gloria is primarily interested in sports. She was national champion of water- akling several years in a row. Now she is devoting her- self to tennis which she plays reasonably well. Dancing is probably her next great interest. In my opinion she does not have sufficient time left to devote to marxism or economics of politics. She seems particularly fil- informed about politics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

It would b. pir-
ily natural for us to invite the Pintos to dinner. We
have maintained contact with them through tennis at least
twice a week. There have been occasional dinners among
us.

He could also invite Valentin with or without the
Pintos. Valentin has done us at least one favor which
we have not reciprocated, an invitation to the Moscow
Circus.

GLORIA'S FEELING ABOUT THE US. I believe that Gloria
is less anti-American than the average middle-class Mexicanl.
She has travelled to the US many times for vacations and
shopping. She knows the US rather well, but she does not
seem pro-US.

RECRUITABILITY OF GLORIA. I am convinced that she
would never agree to work for the US. She might consider
working for a false-flag "Verdian" if she were told
that Val had been observed participating in some heinous
espionage act, supplying arms and money to the communist
student agitators, for example. Her-ultimate objectives
are not clear in my mind. I doubt that she could ever
hope to recruit Valentin to defect to Mexico. I am sure
she could never recruit him as an agent of Mexico. It
does seem possible that she might be able to get him
to reveal his disappointments and grievances--information
which might be of value to us.

PRO-I and II. At the moment I have insufficient
information about the Pintos to prepare a complete PRO I
or II. If it is deemed of interest, we could exchange
invitations during the next few weeks in order to obtain
the necessary information.

DATE OF INFORMATION: December 21, 1988. 1100 hours
PLACE ACQUIRED: French Club

I saw Cloria talking to Jouri Tchernych. I joined them. Gloria was turning on all of her not inconsiderablé charm. Invited Touri to her posada. Then asked whom she should ces at the Soviet embassy about a business deal alho ul. Waa told this would be Ivanov. Gloria said she know him and deaerlled him as big and corpulent.

SLOT: Tony Valero
DATE OF : November 20, 1963

CLASS R REASON: For various reasons, I would
like to know if there is any information in the files on Tony.

INTEREST IN RUSSIAN. Tony has shown an unusual interest in Valentia Loguinoy. He recently made a date with Val to play tennis at the French Club. Tony admitted to making quite an effort to keep his date, despite other committments which had come up. Val, however, did not show and did not call Tony. Tony seemed far more annoyed than would be normal under the circumstances.

TONY'S FATHER, AMERICAN. Tony has a large family here and in the US. His father is an American and Tony speaks excellent English. He is very friendly, well-liked, pro-US!!, excellent tennis player.

# CONTACT REPORT:
SUBJECT: LIROBBINS/1 P-11665
DATE OF MEETING: 14 November 1968

1. The undersigned met with LIROBBINS/1 at his apartment on 14 November from 1500 to 1630 hours. LIROBBINS/2 was ill in bed (flu) and was unable to participate in this meeting. The LIROBBINS daughter, Lisa, was present in the house during the meeting which prompted REIDEMANN to inquire of L/1 if the daughter was aware of the type of relationship which the LIROBBINS had with REIDEMANN. L/1 replied that "they" had told their daughter inasmuch as she had come to suspect such a relationship over the past year or so. REIDEMANN felt that it would be of little purpose, at this time, to admonish the LIROBBINS and dropped the subject. REIDEMANN has found the LIROBBINS to be woefully lacking in general security principles and has strived, in a tactful manner, to point out past shortcomings and possible security hazards - especially with regard to telephone conversations.

2. In response to REIDEMANN's question regarding attendance at the 7 November reception, L/1 stated that they had both attended. L/1 commented that there appeared fewer people this year than last.. As a matter of fact, L/1 could identify only two people in the entire throng that he had previously known. They were: the Indian Embassy Counsellor (?), FNU PARASHAR and an American couple, Lulu Vargas-Vila de LEE (wife), who is the correspondent for La Union (Valparaiso); La Prensa (Buenos Aires); El Tiempo (Bogota) and resides at Platon 445 - 2nd floor, Tol: 20-10-23. The LIRO3-INS spoke briefly with both of the above parties as well as SARATOV (P-13125), SYCHEV (P-11113), LOGIKOV (P-11712) and PALIIOKO (P-2270). The conversation adhered to generalities such as the Olympics, food, etc.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

appeared to be Mexicans - a large number of them clad in their every- day clothes. There was also a sprinkling of Mexican student-appearing types. For the record, L/1 reported that his automobile is a 1965 blue, two-door, Oldsmobile bearing Oklahoma license plates, ZS-8546 (1968 plates).

3. With reference to SARATOV's party on the evening of 13 November, L/1 commented that he and L/2 arrived at the party at approximatoly 2000 remaining until ca. 0030, 14 November. The LIROBBINS were the last to leave although they departed only minutes after the rest of the guests. The guest list included: The LIROBBINS, Arnold Bilgore and wife JoAnne, Roger CUDNEY (Radio VIP) and wife, and the Saratovs. English was the common language spoken and L/1 noted that both the Saratovs handled the language with ease although as the evening progressed ari SARATOV'd liquor consumption increased his fluency and articulation became more labored. L/1 stated that SARATOV pushed liquor very hard the entire evening starting out with two pre-dinner drinks andthen serving vodka in accompaniement to the borsch. Wine was served with the main course, Chinese beef, prepared by Nataliya SARATOVA. Dessert was accompanied with brandy and the evening progressed with long drinks after dinner. L/1 stated that SARATOV drank with the group al though 1/1 doubted that SARATOV matched the men drink for drink. Mrs. SARATOVA appeared at ease and seemed to enjoy the conversation. L/1 assessed her as a woman who complemented her husband and made a charming and vivacious appearance. L/1 seemed to be struck with SARATOV's apparent"sincerity" in is his enjoyment of the evening and his "candor" in the discussions. For the most part, the conversation edged away from any controversial subjects; seemingly all were content to dwell upon "Old Mexico" of 20 years ago and the joys of simple living in the city. During a discussion of the style of night life in Moxico, SARATOV remarked that he enjoyed


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

a good strip-tease performance now and then relating that he had seen a number of them when he was in the States. SARATOV spoke nostalgically of his life in the States admitting that ho missed many aspects of his life there. L/1 remarked that the conversation was largely centered around comments by the BILGORES and L/1 and L/2 inasmuch as the CUDNEYS were very reserved and seldom expressed themselves to any degree. L/1 commented that to the best of his knowledge the CUDNEY's ad SARATOV'S had first met and the dinner party held by the LIROBBINS. L/1 expressed some surprise in that the CUDNEY's were invited as they are rather shy and inexpressive. Toward the end of the evening, L/1 was able to raise the question of the Soviet invasion of the CSSR. SARATOV staunchly defended the Soviet and Warsaw Pact occupation claiming that it was a necessary move because of the increasing aggressiveness of the West Germans and that the avowed purpose of West German truculence was to put pressure on both the CSSR and East Germany in hopes of reunifying Germany. SARATOV did not become emotional over his defense, but left little doubt that he wholeheartedly approved of the Soviet move into the CSSR. Neither the BILGORE's or the LIROBBIN'S pursued the issue although L/1 commented to SARATOV that he was not convinced by SARATOV's defense of Soviet actions. In short, L/1 felt that the evening went off smoothly and as the LIROBBINS departed SARATOV walked them down the steps and solicitously inquired of L/1 as to whether they (SARATOV'S) had entertained properly and if all had been satisfied with the SARATOV's production. L/1 found this vaguely out of keeping with SARATOV's personality and somewhat gauche. L/1 noted that the SARATOV apertment was modern and well-kept giving every evidence of having been lived in. The SARATOV's possess a large European make combination phono-radio set which was tuned to light FM music for back- ground. SARATOV stated that he had inherited this from his predecessor. SARATOV'S one child (age 9) was in bed when the guests arrived. Upon departing, SARATOV inquired of the LIROBBINS if they planned to attend the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 143

forthcoming Acapulco film festival. L/1 stated that he was not sure if he would journey there and SARATOV stated that he and his wife planned to attend.

4. LIROBBIN/1 stated that during a recent conversation which he -had with Stratford JONES (US citizen representing AP in Mexico), JONES commented that he knew both SARATOV and SYCHEV. JONES remarked that he had been to a party at SYCHEV's during the Olympics. KT- Further-more, JONES related that he knew the KUCHEROV'S (TASS) and that Mrs. KUREKAWY KUCHEROV had been sent home before the departure of KUCHEROV. JONES strongly implied that security reasons wore behind the rather abrupt departure of Mrs. KUCHEROV. L/1 did not press the issue any further.

5. LIROBBIN/1 also reported that the Foreign. Press Club in in a chaotic state in that the president, Jose QUIROGA, has accused the club director, Katherine MANJARREZ, of embezzling funds. The truth of the matter, however, seems to be that QUIROGA is engaged in either shady dealing or is guilty of sloppy administration of finances. At any rate, L/1 commented that all members must pay cash for all services and that the club's creditors are pushing for cash payments of all services. The "scandal" seems to have shaken the Club and many members are staying away until the financial situation is corrected.

6. The undersigned inquired of L/l as to whether he knew of any US citizens who might be looking for an apartment. L/1 stated that he was currently unaware of anyone desiring housing but that he would keep his ears open and make a few discreet inquiries without revealing that he knows of any vacancies.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/IC/SB

VIA: Chief of Station C/IC

SUBJECT: Consular Corps Visit to Veracruz

1. The undersigned visited Veracruz on 9 and 10 November together with other members of the Consular Corps on an official visit to that city. Although the Cubans were scheduled to attend and official diplomas proclaiming them guests of the City of Veracruz were prepared, none of them showed up, including Lino SALAZAR Chia, who is stationed in Veracruz. The Czechs, East Germans, and Poles for a number of reasons also failed to go on this trip. Thus, the only Communist representative was Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, with whom the undersigned had plenty of opportunity to talk. It seems that LOGINOV, at least for public consumption, considers the undersigned "his friend." LOGINOV was accompanied by his wife.

2. The following were the main points of interest discussed by LOGINOV:

a. The Soviet appeared very anxious to get the undersigned's opinion on a subject to which he kept going back time and again during the visit: the position of the Richard M. NIXON administration vis-a-vis Communist China. Specifically, what LOGINOV wanted to know was what the chances are that the NIXON administration might attempt to bring about a rapprochement between Communist China and the United States. LOGINOV approached this topic from various directions, and the undersigned had the distinct impression that he had received a specific query on this subject. At one point, LOGINOV stressed the importance of Communist China to his country, indicating that his government is becoming increasingly concerned with developments there.

b. Connected with the above was LOGINOV's concern for peace in Vietnam. For the first time that the undersigned can remeber, a Soviet stated that the United States and his country had "a common interest of utmost importance" in bringing peace to Vietnam. That the Soviet interest may be connected with their concern about Communist China was indicated by LOGINOV when the latter indicated that peace should be obtained in Vietnar as a way to keep out the Chinese Communists. This did not prevent LOGINOV from making the usual noises in favor of the National Liberation Front and the Vietcong, blasting away at South Vietnamese militarism.

c. While talking about the Middle East, LOGINOV said that the Soviet Union was in the Mediterranean to stay and fully intended to give such support to the Arab nations in that area as to someday "get rid of Israel." LOGINOV specifically stated, "The Jews have it coming to them, and the day of reckoning is coming." The undersigned was curious to know whether this was prompted on LOGINOV's part by a dislike of the Israelis or an anti-Semitic feeling. LOGINOV was quite blunt and categorically stated that he for one "hated all Jews," and did not hide his profound anti-Semitism. LOGINOV added that Jews are parasites who have little nationalism other than that generated by the Zionist cause. He implied that those Jews left in the Soviet Union are foreigners who have done little to help the Soviet cause. The undersigned pointed out that anti-Semitism has been a long Russian tradition, dating back to before the Revolution, and deplored this obvious discrimination. He added that this reminded him of the anti-Semitism of the party which not so long ago made mass murder of Jews a matter of national policy.

d. It took LOGINOV about one day to bring up the Sucesos para Todos article. The undersigned jokingly asked him whether this was a Soviet or Cuban sponsored joke, saying that rumor had it that Sucesos was financed by both the Soviets and the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

SECRET

-3-

Cubans. LOGINOV denied this, saying that the staff
of Sucesos could not be put by any stretch of the
imagination into the category of "Communists." He
then point-blank asked the undersigned whether he
belonged to the organization mentioned in the
article. The undersigned laughingly answered that
if such trashy publications as Sucesos were believed
by anyone "of course he belonged to that organization."
LOGINOV laughed and made a few more noises about how
Sucesos obtained the undersigned's name. The latter
replied that his name was probably selected at
random from stolen pages of the Embassy directory
or other such document. He added that if LOGINOV
had wanted his phone number he would have been glad
to have given it to him rather than see it appear
in Sucesos.

e. The discussion the undersigned had with
LOGINOV in Guadalajara about the KGB was apparently
not forgotten by the Soviet, for the latter pulled
out of his purse a copy of the stamp commemorating
some KGB anniversary that the undersigned had
mentioned to him. The undersigned has no idea of
the reasons for this gesture. One of the topics
which seems to embarrass LOGINOV the most is the
number of visas he signs at the Soviet Embassy.
Whenever LOGINOV gets a little too pointed in his
provocations, the undersigned raises this subject,
with LOGINOV invariably giving a little laugh and
no answer.

f. LOGINOV indicated that he was aware that
the undersigned had met with Jiri SVESTKA at the
time of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia
and asked for his opinion of SVESTKA. The undersigned
made no bones about the fact that he had a long lunch
with the Czech. He said he had found him to be "muy
de la izquierda," adding that unfortunately SVESTKA
belonged to the very small minority of his country
which had wolcomed Soviet intervention. The under-
signed predicted that the Soviets would have con-
siderable trouble with Czechoslovakia and pointed
out that this serious error had tarnished the cause!

of the Soviet Union. He said, for example, that the Soviet intervention was very unpopular in Mexico. This seemed to draw a little blood from LOGINOV, as he abruptly interrupted the undersigned and asked, "Where is it popular?"

CONTACT REPORT:

SUBJECT: LIROBBINS/1 and 2.

DATE OF MEETING: 15 October 1968

1. The undersigned met with LIROBBINS/1 and 2 at their apartment on 15 October from 1600 to 1730 hours. The LIROBBINS were informed that REIDEMANN would be out of the country for the next two weeks and, accordingly, were requested to contact "" should they obtain information which they deem perishable and of urgency. The ROBBINS will contact "" either at HHH the Station or at home via telephone. A supplementary report on the activities of Pearl GONZALEZ is attached to this Contact Report as a Memorandum for the Record (separate).

2. LIROBBINS/2 reported that on 2 October Aleksandr PRIKHODKO (P-2270) delivered an invitation to the LIROBBINS to attend a reception at the Soviet Embassy for the Soviet Olympic team. PRIKHODKO did not come in and visit with the LIROBBINS but merely made out an invitation for the LIROBBINS to attend. Both the LIROBBINS attended the function arriving at approximately 1930 and departing about 2130. The reception was rather poorly organized and there were few people in attendance from the Mexico City community. The LIROBBINS stated that they were the only American journalists and recognized no other guests with the exception of a Mexican movie star/director, Amilio FERNANDEZ ("El Indo") and wife. During the reception, LIROBBINS/2 saw SARATOV (P-13125) who approached the LIROBBINS and apologized for the fact that he had not been able to hold his party. SARATOV said that he had been extremely busy with the Olympics which occasioned him to go out to the airport every day as well as doing the work of others who he implied had been shirking their duties. SARATOV repeated his regret that he had not been able to organize the promised party, but assured the LIROBBINS that as soon as the Olympics were over


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

he would invite the LIROBBINS (and others) to a special party. The LIROBBINS noted that SHURININ (P-11113) was not in attendence at this reception. The LIROBBINS also passed a few light remarks with LOGINOV (P-11712) regarding the party reception and the Olympics. L/1 noted that LOGINOV spoke to them in fluent English although he had previously denied to L/1 and L/2 that he spoke or understood English.

Mr. Loyd Rosenfield

Balderas 87
Mexico, D.F.

Dear Loyd Rosenfield of the SEELINES Dept.;

My father was a government official in Greece -

We are now here in Mexico. We know for sure that the C.I.A. of the United States engineered the military take-over of the Greek government and the errection of the present police state that exists there.

In Peru, I suspect a similar course of events has taken place.

We would like to stay here in Mexico: Do you think that the militarists of Mexico are planning to take over the government of Mexico? Doesn't it make sense that if the militarists are able to create a state of civil disorder that they will be granted more power, to the extent that they will become the acting government of Mexico, like the governments which have recently come into being in Greece and Peru? Couldn't the terrorist groups like the "Murro" and the so-called "Communists" be in actuality employees of the militarist institutions of this country whose purpose it is to frustrate a situation which only the military-police state could control?

And lastly, I know you have no way of responding to this last question but I will ask it anyway: Don't you think that the American C.I.A. is at least as influential here in Mexico and Latin America as it has been in my country? Excuse me for not signing by hand. Respectfully yours,

SUBJECT: Julio PLATAS Urbina, born 10 October 1941 in Empalme,
Sonora

1. It has come to our attention that Julio PLATAS Urbina,
   an agent of the Soviet KGB, is presently living in Bacobampo,
   Sonora. PLATAS has been known to us since 1961, when he was in
   contact with Aleksander BROVKIN, a KGB officer who was then
   and still is attached to the Soviet Ambassy in Moxico City as
   a Third Secretary. In 1965, PLATAS was in contact with Valentin
   LOGINOV, a KGB officer who is a Third Secretary and Consul of
   the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

2. The exact nature of PLATAS'S KGB assignments is unknown
   to us, but he is believed to be a courier, carrying both money
   and drugs in behalf of the KGB. His courier duties are also
   believed to have brought him in contact with the Communist Party
   of Mexico.

3. PLATAS is believed to have traveled considerably through-
   out Latin America, and is known to have been in Argentina and
   Great Britain in 1967. According to our information, he has just
   received a new assigumont, a courier mission which may begin as
   early as 1 August 1968.

4. We would appreciate receiving the results of your inter-
   rogation of PLATES particularly since he is alleged to have
   knowledge of Soviet attempts to recruit personnel of the U.8.
   Babassy in Mexico.

# The Consul General

C/PRO - T. Frank Crigler

## Manuscripts of "General" Norton SLONE

April 4, 1966

Just after 5:00 PM last Friday, Sr. Higinio Gómez Jr., previously unknown to me but whose calling card indicates that he is employed by the Weyerhauser Paper Company here, brought to the Protection and Welfare Office a blue canvas bag containing two book-length manuscripts. Sr. Gómez stated that he had found the bag containing the manuscripts in the elevator of the office building in which he works, at Reforma No. 308, opposite the Embassy. He said that he was ignorant as to the identity of their author, as well as who it might have been who had left them in the elevator. He had examined them briefly, he said, and then decided that they ought immediately to be brought to the Embassy.

The cardboard cover sheets of both manuscripts identified the author as Horton Slone, and one of these showed his address to be "General" Horton Slone, c/o Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, Chief of the F.B.I., Pa. Ave. at 9th Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. The books were entitled "Swords along the Shore," and "Kozotan - Folklore of the Incas." A cursory examination of the former revealed a clumsy hate theme, charging minority groups in the United States with selling out to the communists. The letter was apparently a romantic treatment in novel form of Pizarro's conquest of Peru.

As you are aware, the manuscripts were delivered to you on the same day for storage and subsequent disposition.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: RESABER P-8777
DATE OF MEETING: 3 June 1968

1. I met Subject in his room at the Del Paseo from 1430 to 1615. The next meeting will be arranged by telephone.

2. LOGINOV. Not hearing from LOGINOV after their telephone conversation on 10 May, Subject called him on 30 or 31 May. Subject told LOGINOV he couldn't remember who was supposed to call whom about setting a date for the LOGINOVS' visit to Subject's home, and he just wanted to check to see that they hadn't gotten their signal crossed. LOGINOV said that it wasn't that he was waiting for Subject to call, but simply that a free date hadn't opened up yet. LOGINOV said that it didn't look as though he was going to be able to get to Subject's home for the next couple of weeks, but that he definitely wanted to take Subject up on his invitation and would call him just as soon as he definitely knew he would have a free Saturday or Sunday when he could come.

3. I instructed Subject to leave the initiative for the next contact to LOGINOV.

4. Pedro* DALMA. DALMA is the general manager of "MEXAMA" in Cuernavaca. The firm deals in citric acid. To the best of Subject's knowledge, DALMA was born in Hungary and came to Mexico about 10 or 15 years ago. He is a member of the "Industrial Club" in Cuernavaca, and Subject occasionally meets

cc: P-11712


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 166

him there. Subject said that DAIMA has tried to be friendly
with him for several years and has many times invited Subject and
his wife to his home. Subject said he has never liked DALMA,
however, and has always found a way out of the invitations.
One reason he didn't like DALMA, Subject said, was that he always
seemed to have something good to say about Communist Hungary.
About nine months ago, DALMA tock a trip to Hungary, and whenever
Subject has seen him since then, he has made a point of telling
Subject how good conditions are in Hungary and how happy everyone
is there. Subject said he thought we should therefore have the
fellow's name in our files.

5. BESABER'S PERSONAL LIFE. In late March, Subject told me
   about a woman he had met on a business trip to New York earlier
   in the month. Her name is Velia SANCHEZ Belmont, Mexican citizen,
   age approximately 33. Subject happened to sit next to her on the.
   flight to New York, struck up a conversation, and ultimately
   spent a few nights with her in New York.

6. Subject told me that Velia was once married to an
   American singer, but had been divorced and subsequently become
   the mistress of Julian RODRIGUEZ Adame, a former Mexican
   Secretary of Agriculture (under LOPEZ Mateos) and currently the
   President of the International Cotton Association. Subject said
   that through RODRIGUEZ Adame, Velia had gotten to know many of
   the top people in the PRI and had become particularly friendly with
   the wife of Alfonso MARTINEZ Dominguez, the new head of the
   PRI. Subject said that Velia had become fairly wealthy as the
   result of her influential contacts and now owned an apartment


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

in New York City, a house in Mexico City, and a second house
in Acapulco, where she also had a sizable piece of undeveloped
land. Subject described Velia as both extremely intelligent
and a tremendous sexual partner, and speculated that because of
her excellent political contacts, she might from time to time be
able to provide some interesting information on the Mexican
political scene.

7. I was in Acapulco on 6 and 7 April, and at Subject's
   invitation spent the afternoon of 7 April with him and Velia
   on the beach at the Pierre Marques Hotel. Subject introduced me
   (by phony name) as a business contact from the States, and I had
   the opportunity to talk with Velia at intervals throughout the
   afternoon. As Subject told me, she is attractive, well-built,
   intelligent, polished, very sharp, and evidently very shrewd.
   She also speaks very good English. She told me she had just
   returned two days ago from a shopping trip to New York with the
   wife of MARTINEZ Dominguez. She said the señora is really just
   a country woman and had asked her to go with her to New York to
   help her pick out a new wardrobe, which she needed for her new
   role as the wife of the leader of the PRI. We later drove to
   Vilia's house for a drink, and from its size and location
   (overlooking the bay between the zocalo and the Caleta Hotel, it
   would indeed appear she had a considerable amount of money.

8. On 3 June, Subject told me that his romance with Velia
   had gotten out of hand, as she was extremely demanding and
   possessive and wanted him to divorce his wife and marry her.
   The problem, Subject said, was that he felt just strongly enough


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

about her that he couldn't just dismiss the idea. Moreover, his wife had learned about Velia, and although she was accustomed to Subject's philandering, she recognized that Velia was a little different from Subject's other girl friends and was extremely upset. Subject asked my opinion and advice, and for what it was worth, I told him I thought he was crazy to even think of breaking up his family and his marriage with a woman whom he claimed to still love and who was tolerant to the point that Subject was able to have both her and all the routine extra- curricular activity he wanted at the same time. I pointed out that this certainly wouldn't be the case with Velia, who would probably poison him if he even looked at another woman. After batting this around for some time, Subject finally said he agreed with me and that if he couldn't simply keep Velia on the string, he'd have no choice but to drop her. This is hardly to say, however, that this is what Subject will do, and I suspect Velia will continue to disrupt Subject's personal life for some time to come.

9. As for our possible use of Velia--and she does seem to have the credentials to be one of the great female spies--there are clearly two considerations which should be mentioned. First, any attempt to use Subject in her exploitation (at least at this point) would further complicate his relations with her and presumably further disrupt his personal life. Second, based on what I know about her from Subject and from personal contact, I am afraid that if we did succeed in recruiting her for whatever

purpose, we would sooner or later find that we had a genuine Mexican tigra by the tail.

DATE OF MEETING: 31 May 1968

1. COIGNE and I met with Subject at the Dairy Queen on San Antonio from 1600 to 1635 hours. Subject will call if anything of interest develops during COIGNE's home leave, and I will meet him at the Dairy Queen at the time specified over the phone.

2. Subject said he had a good friend by the name of Donald BRIGGS who was planning to visit him in Mexico for about three weeks beginning the first or second week of June. BRIGGS, according to Subject, teaches Spanish at Florida State and speaks some Russian. Subject said he mentioned BRIGGS' upcoming visit and the fact BRIGGS knows some Russian to VIDIELLA at class on 27 May. VIDIELLA perked up at this and suggested that he, Subject, BRIGGS, and his (VIDIELLA's) good friend Valentin (LOGINOV)--as a group of Russian speakers--all get together for an evening. VIDIELLA suggested that they go to his French girl friend's apartment and have a blast replete with girls and boose. VIDIELLA then asked if Subject thought BRIGGS would mind if a Soviet Embassy official came along, Subject said he was sure BRIGGS wouldn't mind, and they agreed to make definite plans at a later date.

3. Subject said that VIDIELLA mentioned that his mother had taught Spanish to Valentin in Moscow.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

VIA: Chief, SB
Chief of Station

SUBJECT: Consular Corps Visit to Guadalajara, 17 and 18 May 1968.

1. Among the 30 odd members of the Mexico City Consular Association who traveled to Guadalajara for a semiofficial visit to that city on 17 and 18 May 1936 were Valentin Sergejevic LOGINOV and Vasily CHUMYSA, representing the Soviets; Jiri SVESTKA, representing the Czechs; and Enrique GORDO Labrada and Lino SALAZAR Chia, representing the Cubans. SALAZAR was a surprise to everybody since he is stationed in Veracruz. It must be said, however, that at least one other representative of the Veracruz Consular Association (a Guatemalan or Dominican) also traveled with the group. Travel to and from Guadalajara was by train, giving ample opportunity for a variety of conversations. The undersigned also found himself seated on several occasions next to the Soviets and the Cubans, with whom he also conversed while visiting points of interest listed in the official program of the visit.

2. CICARD certainly made an effort to be as sociable as possible in his dealings with the undersigned. By the end of the visit, as a matter of fact, and in spite of several rather pointed discussions, CICARD appeared to have become the undersigned's good friend, walking about with his arm around the undersigned's shoulder and calling him by his first name. The undersigned found CICARD far more reasonable than his colleague, SALAZAR, and he led that he could have a fairly frank discussion with him without CICARD'S showing irritation or anger. This was important since on several occasions the undersigned made the Soviets laugh at the expense of the Cubans. While on an official visit to the Guadalajara cathedral, in a receiving room adjacent to the cathedral the undersigned asked CICARD what his religion was. CICARD said he was a Communist. The undersigned then pointed out that for a Communist country, Cuba certainly got along splendidly.

with the Vatican, to the point where it had an Ambassador to the Vatican and had celebrated some months ago some distinction accorded by the Pope to the Papal Nuncio in Havana by lighting up the churches at government expense. CICARD readily admitted that there were many "good Communists" in Cuba who were also good Catholics, even, he said, among people fairly high up in the government. He, CICARD, was a dedicated revolutionary, however, who did not give any part of his loyalty to the regime to any type of religion. CICARD went on to emphasize that the close CASTRO relations with the Vatican were a demonstration of the democratic nature of Fidel's regime. On several instances the undersigned joked about Raul CASTRO's recent spe ch which brought about the nationalization of every last small enterprise and further rationing in Cuba of such things as beer and soft drinks. On one occasion he also told CICARD t.at the latter's country was at the end of its rope economically,..
with hard currency reserves at an all-time low since the CASTRO revolution. CICARD agreed that the "economic situation of his country was bad," particularly as far as hard currèncy reserves were concerned. Ne naturally attributed this in part to the so-called American blockade and in other part to the efforts that had previously been made by the government to buy as much machinery as possible to go on with its plan of industrial expansion. When the undersigned mentioned shortages of meat, Fruit, et cetera, CICARD readily admitted these were being sold to purchase badly needed equipment. As far as the sugar crop was concerned, he also admitted that the one of this year would not rasch that of last year, but he would not agree that it would not go over 5,000,000 tons. He and his colleague, however, repeated time and again that they were convinced, as Fidel has promised them, that by 1970 Cuba would have a 10,000,000 ton harvest of sugar. As a matter of fact, the date 1970 came up in the conversation about other matters, as if that date were that from which Cuba would have no more economic problems. Someone in the group mentioned to CICARD that there had been rumors in the press of rapprochement between Cuba and the United States. CICARD said he did not think so because, he said, relations between the two countries were at present "very bad." The undersigned jokingly asked. CICARD about Cyrus PATON'S visit ar the purpose of it. All CICARD would say was that EATON had a meeting with Fidel (photographs of 2.ON and CASTRO appeared in the local news- papers). as to the reason for the trip, CICARD rather

screastically pointed out that that was up to the Ministry of Information and claimed to know nothing about it. On the return trip to Mexico City CICARD broached the topic of the cight beatniks who had recently been arrested by the Mexican police as they were about to board the plane for Cuba and deported to the United States. The undersigned kept a straight face throughout this and told him he knew nothing about it. CICARD protested that news of the arrests and doportation had reached the press. The undersigned told him that he had seen nothing of the sort. CICARD then went on to blame the incident on the American Embassy, which, he said, was behind the arrests and deportation. The undersigned pointed out that the Embassy had other things to do than to concern itself with, according to CICARD'S own description, beatnik-type students. This was, in any case, a Mexican matter and it was not surprising that the people were arrested. and deported, as the Mexicans had arrested and deported many other beatniks of all nationalities. During a rather heated exchange. the previous night in which Yuriy S. CHERNYSH and Jiri SVESTKA were also present, CICARD boasted that Puerto Rico would soon find its freedom. The undersigned really opened up on him and blandly told him that the United States had held a referendum in Puerto Rico, during which it had offered statehood or independence, but the Puerto Ricans preferred to maintain the status which they now enjoy with the United States. He also told CICARD that the two or three bombs that had blown up on the island in recent months and were no doubt the work of the Cubans were probably one of the worst pieces of stupidity that the regime had committed, The undersigned went on to blast. CICARD in front of his Communist friends for the policy of aggression pursued by Cuba in Latin America, even against the advice of the Soviets and other foreign Communists. He said he could not imagine how Cuba could continue with such a program after the rout it suffered in Bolivia and Peru. CHERNYSH and SVESTKA, WhO were listening to this, remained silent during this exchange. CICARD. ch a sarcastic laugh, said that Bolivia and Peru were one thing, but what about Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala? The undersigned told him that these so-called revolutionary movements had badly suffered in the last few month. The control the Cubans claimed to exercise over these movements was also doubtful, as some of these movements had openly criticized the Cubans. The previous day during a visit

to the Center for International Friendship in Guadalajara,
CICARD also boasted of the moral necessity for the Cubans to
help free Latin Americans from the drudge of misery and
מכסression. When the undersigned jobirly asked whether this
included Mexico, CICARD said that the Cubans had to watch
themselves in that country and would do nothing there. The
undersigned, by way of conclusion, warned him that any effort
in Mexico was doomed, as the Cubans would get nowhere in that
country even if they tried. At another point of the visit
both CICARD and SALAZAR denied vehemently that Cuba had
supported any opposition movement in Mexico or that it had
backed guerrilla movements in Guerrero and elsewhere. Both
CICARD and SALAZAR several times joked in the presence of
their Soviet friends that any American aggression against Cuba
would probably mean Russian reprisals against the United States,
but that Cuba in any case was ready for any alternative.
While at the Hilton Hotel, where the group stayed in Guada-
lajara, the undersigned, who was looking out a window over-
looking the garden in the back of the hotel where the pool is,
Spotted CICARD, SALAZAR, and CHERNYSH late on the evening of
18 May, just prior to leaving for the railroad station,
engaged in an animated conversation. While CICARD looked
over his shoulder, SALAZAR scribbled something on the paper
which he handed CHERNYSH. The same day, about half an hour
before going to the Station, Reynaldo CEPEDA Hernandez and
his wife arrived at the Hilton, where they were eventually
introduced to the undersigned by CICARD as "our First Secretary."
The undersigned later asked CICARD what, CEPEDA was doing there
since he was not part of the group and since the Cubans have
no consulate in Guadalajara. With a broad smile CICARD said
he was on "vacation." At one point of the visit, the bus
used by the group left without the undersigned, the Cubans,
and the representative of Ecuador and his wife. It was agreed
to proceed to the banquet which was to be held at Chapala,
some 35 kilometers away, by taxi, if the taxi could not first
locate the bus in the city. The bus was not located, and the
little group proceeded to Chapala, where to the undersigned's
amazement CICARD paid for the entire taxi trip and refused
money from the others.

3. Lino SALAZAR is undoubtedly one of the most uncouth,
   vulgar, and all-around uneducated men the undersigned has
   ever met. A light mulatto, SALAZAR speaks with such a heavy

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

SECRET

-5-

Negro-type accent that it is almost impossible to understand him. As a matter of fact, both LOGINOW and CHERNYSH told the undersigned that the latter seemed to understand SALAZAR far better than they did. At every possible moment ho could squeeze in some Communist propaganda SALAZAR threw in a CASTROist tirade, whether it was relevant to the conversation and the moment or not. He tried to embarrass the wife of the Souch Korean representative who was with the group by asking her whether every Korean woman had a wart over her lip as she did. Fortunately, the wife of the Korean representative speaks very little Spanish and hardly any English, and the undersigned just would not translate. He also, in her presence, launched into a tirade about South Korea, which the undersigned cut off by telling rim that he did not know what he was talking about and that North Korea was the bottom of the barrel as far as nations were concerned. SALAZAR said that in Veracruz the Americans avoided him, but that this was all right with him since he had no business with them. He boasted that he was at the battle of the Bay of Pigs, which, he said, was one of the most tremendous battles of modern times. Since the Russians were listening to this the undersigned turned towards them and asked how many men had died in Stalingrad. LOGINOV said about a million and a half. The undersigned then turned to SALAZAR to say that if a thousand men had been hurt at the Bay of Pigs he would be very surprised. Both SALAZAR and CICARD on several occasions blasted Cuban exiles in the United States, saying that they were men without honor and social responsibility who were afraid to work. The undersigned maintained that on the contrary the exiles, who arrived without a dime, had given a very good accounting of themselves in the work department, as most of them had started new and successful comercial enterprises in the United States. SALAZAR and CICARD said this might be so, but that in any case they had no courage, as if they did not agree with the CASTRO regime they should be in Cuba fighting it. SALAZAR has the manners of an arrogant dog, whistles at the table during dinner, uses obscene language in front of ladies, and, as pointed out above, never fails to give out with strong "patria o muerte" music. During the banquet at Chapala on 18 May SALAZAR, who had come with an expensive camera as did CICARD, took pictures of each member of the group so obviously that the undersigned walked up to him and asked him if he did not want his signature as overheard well, to the great amusement of the Soviets.

this: LIRENO-1, incidentally, has pointed out in his reports that SALAZAR is extremely active in Veracruz and that he has the car of someone important in the city council as well as others. The general commanding the area, who is a source of LIRENO-1, has been looking for a chance to have SALAZAR deported. This Section will see what it can do to oblige him.

4. There was no doubt from LOGINOV's statements to the undersigned that the Soviet had made at least some mental notes before he went on the trip about subjects he should raise with the undersigned. Vietnam, of course, was profusely discussed, but LOGINOV also wanted to know about the state of the clection campaigns in the United States and about the March of the Poor on Washington. Ono afternoon that LOGINOV was with CHERNYSH, the undersigned told him that he could not imagine how the Soviets could favor the candidacy of Bobby KENNEDY, an aristocrat and millionnaire who had never worked with his hands and was liberally spending the family fortune to influence people's minds, when ort HUMPHREY, for example, was far more to the left in the American political spectrum and obviously had the support of the labor unions. No matter what the undersigned said, the Soviets found something good to say about KENNEDY, who appears to be the candidate the Soviet Union would most like to see as the next President. The two Soviets laughingly remarked that the undersigned's apparent dislike for KENNEDY might one day cost him his job. The undersigned said that fortunately the American Government was not at the mercy of the prevailing winds as were the governments of "other countries." The manner in which LOGINOV went about collecting his "information" was interesting and amusing. For example, on the way to Guadalajara, when the undersigned and LOGINOV were alone in the corridor of their coach, LOGINOV mentioned the armistice negotiations in Vietnam. The undersigned, as he has done many times in the past, emphasized that this opportunity to find an adequate peace should not be thrown away, as a backdown in negotiations might increase the tempo of the war to the point where a much larger conflict could result. LOGINOV agreed that no one, including his country, wanted such a conflict and indeed a maximum effort should be made to find peace in Vietnam. The undersigned reiterated that much depended on the Soviets, as the latter obviously had some influence over the worth Vietnamese Government. He then said that peace was possible providing that

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 177

SECRET

-7-

two main conditions were met. At that point someone came by and interrupted the conversation for a good two or three minutes. Rather than renew the argument he could see LOGINOV wanted to develop, the undersigned started to talk about the cattle in the fields, Mexican agriculture, et cetera. LOGINOV listened to this for one or two minutes and then reminded the undersigned he had said something about conditions for the armistice. The undersigned said that the primary condition for peace was for North Vietnam to pull out all of its troops from South Vietnam. Before he could mention the second condition, someone again interrupted the conversation, handed the undersigned and LOGINOV drinks, and remained for a good five minutes. After his departure, the undersigned again talked about something else, but again LOGINOV, after one or two minutes, doggedly went back to the original discussion and wanted to know what the second condition was. The under- signed then told him that this condition was that really free elections be held in South Vietnam. About half an hour later, LOGINOV opened up on the March of the Poor, whereupon the undersigned referred him to a recent article in the U.S. News and World Report listing the salaries of various workers in the United States. Electricians, for example, are listed as making $7.50 an hour. In short, the undersigned pointed out, to be really poor in the United States takes a lot of doing, or rather, a lack of doing. He said he wished the United States could do as the Soviets do and send people without a desire to work or the will to assume responsibility to re- education camps in Siberia and elsewhere. LOGINOV confirmed, in fact, that that was what the Soviet government was doing. LOGINOV also touched upon the search for the assassin of Martin Luther KING, whereupon the undersigned told him that the United States lacked the regimentation of the Soviet Union and the heavy state controls over the population so that it was difficult at times to find a man in that nation of more than 200,000,000 people in one or two days. He also told LOGINOV that it remained to be seen who put the assassin up to his act. The undersigned, of course, mentioned that the assassination was an abominable deed, as KING was probably the most reasonable of the black leaders. He said that had the white extremists, as LOGINOV called them, been behind the assassination, it is probable that Stokeley CARMICHAEL or Rap BROWN would have been shot. During the ride on the bus and out of the clear blue, LOGINOV asked the undersigned

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 178

SECRET

-8-

whether he had met J. Edgar HOOVER. The undersigned said he had not. LOGINOV then said that he was a bachelor. The undersigned said that if he was it was probably because in his 40 years as head of the FBI he had had an awfully lot to do. The undersigned then pointed out that the FBI was a thoroughly respected organization in the United States which had the support of the people. LOGINOV thon switched to the CIA, but the undersigned told him that unlike the FBI, on which quite a bit was known to the American people, very little filtered out about the CIA. LOGINOV made ono more crack about the periodic changes at the helm of the CIA and dropped the subject. A somewhat similar conversation occurred a little later between the undersigned, LOGINOV, and CHERNYSII when unexpectedly LOGINOV mentioned something about the KGB and its dedication to the protection of the Soviet people and the Constitution. The undersigned asked LOGINOV for a sample of the stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the KGB. Neither CHERNYSH nor LOGINOV seemed to know that such a stamp existed but launched into praise of the service which assured the protection of the Soviet people with such a light hand. The undersigned returned that the KGB was an organization with a terrible reputation overseas, where, contrary to what the Soviets had just told him, they appeared to maintain numerous stations. LOGINOV then pointed out that the United States police did not have a light hand and, as he put it, cracked heads any time they had a chance. The undersigned said that, on the contrary, when a firm hand had to be used, the police had a very bad time of it during everyday life, as recent decisions of the Supreme Court made law enforcement a very difficult business because of the emphasis given by the Court to the respect and protection of human rights. Surprisingly enough, neither the Soviets, nor the Czechs, nor the Cubans had much to say about recent race riots in the States other than to confirm for themselves that quite damage had been done. The undersigned had the opportunity to talk to LOGINOV alone about the recent speech of Raul CASTRO and the following nationalization of businesses and restrictions imposed on the Cuban people. LOGINOV, who, incid tally, made no bones about the fact that his country is muc.: opposed to CASTRO's policy of expansion of terrorist activities in Latin America, a the complete nation-alization of private business as an action with which ha "did not agree." He said that the Cuban Communist state

SECRET

was a young one and on occasion claimed to know more than those who have been purifying Communism for 50 years and more. The undersigned joked about the fact that the Soviet Union would have to give the Cubans petroleum free if the sugar crop this year was as bad as it appeared to be. LOGINOV had a good chuckle över this but did not comment.

5. The undersigned, who has already had the feeling that Jiri SVESTKA apes the Soviets, copies their line, and mimics their comportment, had confirmation of all this during the trip. SVESTKA was one of the first to raise the topic of Vietnam and pour oil over the fire. During dinner in the dining car on the way to Guadalajara, where he sat with the undersigned and the two Soviets, the topic of the Red army came up. The undersigned, who had previously told the Russians that he served for a brief time with that army, said that he had great admiration for the military feats of the Russians. This led SVESTKA to say that the Red army was never beaten. The undersigned then gave SVESTKA a short refresher course in what had happened in Warsaw in 1920 or 1921, when a Franco-Prussian army led by Gen. Maxime WEYGAND and Gen. Jozef PILSI DSKI beat an invading Soviet army, which had, among other things, Joseph STALIN as its commissar. SVESTKA tried to dispute the fact that this took place, whereupon the under-signed offered to buy him a history book. That seemed to pre ent SVESTKA from making any other expeditions into history during the remainder of the trip. Most of the discussions with the Czech, Soviets, and Cubans were on extremely friendly terms, in spite of their pointedness at times. During the night of 18 May, during the train trip back to Mexico City, a particularly heated discussion took place in a compartment Where CHERNYSH, SVESTKA, and CICARD were present. This. discussion will be reviewed in the next paragraph. Suffice it to say that at one point SVESTKA intervened in the defense of CHERNYSH to say something about how indebted Czechoslovakia was to the Soviets. The undersigned then told him that if it had not been the decision of President Franklin D. ROOSEVELT, at the urging, apparently, of STALIN, to stop the advance of the United States army into Czechoslovakia to allow the Russians to liberate Prague, the armistice would not have, found Soviet troops occupying Czechoslovakia, and "things night have been completely different for the Czech nation." When, SVESTKA claimed to bo bewildered by this statement, the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 180

SECRET

-10-

undersigned even more blandly asked him if he meant to say that Czechoslovakia would have become a Communist power had the Soviet armies not occupied the country by the end of the War. SVESTKA said that there was no doubt about this, that the coming of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia had been inevitable because of the historical and social background of he Czechs. The undersigned expressed horror at a statement like this, which did not take into consideration the fact that such anti-Communists as Jan MASARYK and Eduard BENES were the fathers of the Czech state. SVESTKA then went on to say that indeed neither MASARYK nor BENES had been Communist, but that neither had any deep knowledge of the inborn desires of the Czech people. The undersigned told him that this was enough to make both MASARYK and BENES turn over in their graves. He pointed out that there had been a violent exchange, according to the Mexican press, between the Czech and Soviet papers over MASARYK, with the Russians saying that MASARYK had participated in an attempt to kill Nikolai LENIN. CHERNYSH said that this was a pack of lies, that he had reviewed the Soviet press for that period and found nothing about MASARYK. This was quickly endorsed by. SVESTKA. When the undersigned once more stated his belief that people who had known better would take the first opportunity to overthrow Communism, both CHERNYSH and SVESTKA started speaking at the same time. The undersigned pointed out that the Russian people had never known anything other than a curb on personal freedom and very strong central government, but the Czechs, the Poles, the Hungarians, and others had known differently. Such people were thirsty for personal freedcms and direct control over their destiny. When CHERNYSH said he doubted this, the under- signed reminded him that it was Russian tanks that had crushed the students and workers' revolt in Hungary in 1956. He also pointed to the recent quiet but radical revolution which hạd taken place in Czechoslovakia, saying that, for example, the day after the right to strike had been re-established practi-, cally all workers struck to protest 20 years of mismanagement, poor housing, and lack of freedom. From that point on SVESTKA remained silent, apparently having been shaken up.. The undersigned allowed himself to think that in several years. at least the Czechs, like the Rumanians before them, would be governing themselves without having first to check with Moscow. This discussion ended about 130 in the morning. At 9:00 the undersigned saw LOGINOV, with whom he had a chat about various

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 181

-11-

things. He inquired about SVESTKA. LOGINOV said he had
briely seen him on his way to the dining car, but commented
that WESTKA looked mighty unhappy about something. It was
obvious to the undersigned that, as mentioned above, the
previous night's discussion had really shaken up the Czech,
who was worrying about how things would turn out in Czecho-
slovakia and about his future. SVESTKA, as a matter of fact,
mentioned to the undersigned when he saw him a few minutes
later that he had felt that part of the previous night's
discussion had been conducted in what he phrased as a rather
cool atmosphere. This feeling was obviously not shared by
CHERNYSH, despite the heat of the discussion, who warmly
greeted the undersigned the next morning, and unless the
undersigned is very much mistaken, appeared to have a sort of
liking for him.

6. The undersigned finds CHERNYSH a fairly easy man to
   talk to. Not that CHERNYSH is not a dedicated Communist, but
   he seems to enjoy a good discussion, probably because he
   finds this a good opportunity to pass on typical Communist
   views. Before the discussion the night of 18 May mentioned
   above, during which CHERNYSH was one of the main participants,
   the Ukrainian and the undersigned had previously discussed
   such things as Western-style elections and the right to strike.
   On both topics CHERNYSH obviously was not on the same wave
   length as the undersigned. He appeared to believe his state-
   ments to the effect that a strike was unnecessary in a society
   dedicated to the well-being of the workers. It would only
   cripple an economy struggling hard to meet local demands. On
   the subject of elections CHERNYSH was even further away from
   the Western view. He pointed out that some Americans, and
   perhaps the undersigned, did not have any particular liking
   for any of the candidates for presidential elections. This
   made the element of choice a very marginal benefit, if benefit
   it was. The picking of a president and a political leader
   inside the government where these men could be thoroughly
   tested and screened was a much better prospect. The under-
   signed naturally explained at length that, according to the
   old cliche, "variety is the spice of life," and that choice
   is a born right. The undersigned said that he would never be
   able to live in a place where he could pick his close
   friends, his family companions, or the people scheduled to
   represent him in the republic. That seemed to make no dent

in all of CHERNYSH's arguments. The undersigned scored a little more during the previously mentioned discussion during the night of 18 May. He then had a better chance to compare the American Constitution with the Soviet one, underscoring the elements of centralisa and curès on personal choice. The discussion of the role of the Russians in World War II permitted his question of whether the Russians had fought for their country or for their regime. The undersigned told CHERNYSH that his contact with Soviet soldiers during the War had no doubt in his mind that the latter had fought for their country and families first, and much later to back up their regime. Both SVESTRA and CHERNYSH naturally argued with this view, particularly SVESTKA, who at tires can be more pro-Soviet than the Soviets. As pointed out above, CHERNYSH seems to like the undersigned's company, and the farewell between him and the undersigned at the station in Mexico City appeared to be particularly warn. This, of course, is not viewed by the Cubans or SVESTKA with a particularly good eye.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

VIA : Chief, SB
Chief of Station

SUBJECT : Celebration of the Czech National Day,
9 May

17 May 1968

1.  The celebration of the Czech national day on 9 May
    was held at the residence of the Czech Ambassador, Karel HANUS,
    in Polanco, where the undersigned estimated that the crowd
    numbered at least 150 people. The only other Americans
    present were Mr. Wallace W. STUART, head of the Political
    Section, and Mr. David N. WIESLEY, Honorary Consul of Iceland.
    The undersigned was a little bit surprised to see Rodolphe
    BABOUN, the new Haitian Acting Ambassador, in attendance with
    a colored Haitian. BABOUN, as a matter of fact, spoke briefly
    to the Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas.

2.  The undersigned had several little discussions with
    Jiri SVESTKA, Czech Consul and known intelligence officer.
    When he casually reminded SVESTKA that Czechoslovakia was an
    industrial power before World War I and that Czech products
    flooded Western Europe, SVESTKA sharply commented that his
    country was still an industrial power. When the undersigned
    mentioned that MASARYK was very popular in the United States,
    SVESTKA countered that that was no doubt because he had lived
    as an exile in the United States. SVESTKA cut short a remark
    by the undersigned about the effort currently being made to
    throw light on MASARYK's death by saying, "There is no doubt
    that he committed suicide." SVESTKA showed himself on this
    occasion a rival of LOGINOV as far as provocations are
    concerned. After the undersigned answered comments on the
    Negro problem and forthcoming urban terrorism and guerrilla
    warfare in the United States, SVESTKA mentioned the "overt
    letter" to the American Ambassador which appeared in various
    local newspapers. He hinted that the incident "described"

P-11712


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

-2-

in the open letter was not only a blunder on the part of Ambassador FREEMAN, but also indicative of the superiority complex of the United States. At one point, when Valentin LOGINOV had joined in the discussion, the undersigned retorted that the man who had written the article was a fourth-class writer without a dime who somehow had found the thousands of pesos necessary to place his editorial. When the Czech and the Russian laughed, the undersigned continued that if the Soviet Union wanted to give money to the Mexican Communist Party to engage in such shenanigans to amuse the local members of socialist countries, it was fine with the Americans, as this is just about all it could hope to achieve. SVESTKA and LOGINOV naturally denied that their countries had anything to do with the Mexican Communist Party, not to speak of the overt letter on the Ambassador. The undersigned, tongue in cheek, then pointed out that he was glad to tell them for their information that a Communist Party did exist in Mexico.

Perhaps the most interesting reaction of SVESTKA came towards the end of the party just before the undersigned left. During a discussion which included SVESTKA, LOGINOV, one of the Soviet military attaches (a tall colonel with white hair), another Russian, and a youngish, short, and chubby member of the Mexican Foreign Ministry the undersigned expressed a thought that the two systems of government, the capitalist and the soviet, were gradually inching closer together. When SVESTKA allowed himself to doubt it with a nasty little laugh the undersigned naturally could not resist telling him to have a look at what was going on in his country. The reaction of SVESTKA was both immediate and noticeable. He sort of straightened out, jerked his head back, opened his mouth, dropped the ashes of his cigar on the floor, and obviously bit his tongue as he said nothing. From the above and from the fact that SVESTKA plans to drive to the next Consular Association meeting in Guadalajara with his Soviet colleagues, the undersigned feels that SVESTKA is not only a lackey of the ex-NOVOTNY regime, but very probably in the employ of the Soviet KGB. He seems to be inseparable from LOGINOV and has lately mouthed the same provocations in the same techniques, showing himself more and more aggressive, a thing which he was not a year ago.

3. Among other nasty little remarks made by LOGINOV, including references to the open letter against the Ambassador, the war in Vietnam, the Negro problem, the difficult financial position of the dollar, et cetera, was a reference to this Station. LOGINOV at one point asked the undersigned where he worked (not the first time he has asked this). The undersigned told him that he worked in the Consular General's Office. LOGINOV then said, "What about the fifth floor?" The undersigned told him that the fifth floor comprised both the Ambassador's Office and the Political Section. LOGINOV went on to say something like, "I know about the Ambassador, but what about the other offices, those occupied by WOFIRM?" The undersigned let that one go by as LOGINOV had obviously found it very funny. He proceeded to pay back the Soviets a litt'e later by counting on his fingers the number of visas issued at the Soviet Embassy each year, the number of cultural exchanges handled by the Embassy staff, and "all the work done for trade promotion with Mexico." The undersigned felt tha the Soviets probably issued some five visas a month, if thac many, had about ten cultural exchanges a year, and had practically no trade with the Mexicans. What, then, he asked, were the 40 odd "diplomats" in the Soviet Embassy doing in Mexico? LOGINOV laughed, but he laughed green and promptly broke off this conversation.

4. The undersigned had no opportunity to talk at any length with Ambassador HANUS, who was very busy at the reception. The Ambassador, however, greeted him warmly and gave him a prolonged bear hug as he left. The undersigned had no talk with the Cubans except a few words which hẹ exchanged with Sergio MARTINEZ, whom he had not met before.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: BESABER P-8777

DATE OF MEETING: 16 May 1968

1. I met Subject in his room in the Del Paseo Hotel from 1415-1630. The next meeting will be arranged by telephone.

2. LOGINOV. Subject reported that LOGINOV called him at his factory in Cuernavaca on Friday, 3 May. LOGINOV said he had some visitors who would like to buy a few things to take back with them to Russia and asked if it would be convenient if he brought them down to Subject's factory on Saturday afternoon, 4 May. Subject said fine and invited LOGINOV and the visitors to come back to his house for a few drinks after they finished shopping. LOGINOV gratefully accepted and said they would be there at 1330. (Per LIENVOY--see attached transcript--LOGINOV called BEWEEP on 3 May to ask for Subject's telephone number.)

3. LOGINOV arrived (in 19 DA, a dark blue Chevy) at the factory at 1345 with three other persons:

(a) A big, fat, plain, peasant-looking woman by the name of "IGOROVA," "IGANOVA," or something similar. LOGINOV introduced her as a commercial representative, but did not elaborate..

(b) A second Russian woman whose name Subject couldn't remember. She looked to be 33-35 years old and wore glasses. LOGINOV did not mention her profession, and she seemed simply to be a friend of the first woman.

cc: P-9097 (P-11712


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 187

(c) The son of one of the above two women. He appeared to be about 12 years old.

4. LOGINOV and his three companions shopped for about an hour while Subject worked in his office, and in the end bought 450-500 pesos worth of merchandise (at wholesale prices, of course). Subject and the four Russians then left together, got into their respective cars, and drove to Subject's home with Subject leading the way. When they were driving into Subject's driveway, Subject, in view of his wife and two children and the four Russians, accidentally ran over and broke the back of one of the BESABERS' beloved dachshunds. Chaos reigned for the next ten minutes as Subject went into the house, got his pistol, and returned and shot the dog while the children screamed, Mrs. BESABER tried to suppress her own tears and shoo away the children at the same time, and the four Russians sat aghast in their car and watched. LOGINOV acted extremely sorry and did his best to console Mrs. BESABER and Subject. Mrs. BESABER recovered quickly, however, and soon had all the adults seated in the living room. Subject served the first round of drinks, and within a half hour everyone was at least reasonably relaxed again.

5. LOGINOV was the only one who did not take an alcoholic drink. He wore dark sunglasses all afternoon and explained that he had to stay away from liquor because he was taking antibiotics for an eye infection. Despite this ailment and inability to take a drink, LOGINOV was nevertheless more sociable and friendly than Subject had ever seen him. He also struck Subject as being


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 188

more relaxed than in the past. He brought the BESABERS two bottles of vodka and two cans of caviar, asked why Subject hadn't called or visited him at the Embassy, addressed Subject only as "tu" (where he had formerly mixed "tus" and "usteds" with Subject), enthusiastically toured the BESABERS' new house, and patiently translated for the two Russian women, neither of whom spoke Spanish or English. The conversation was generally dull, however, and nothing even mildly controversial was discussed. The Russians finally left about 1700.

6. In the course of the conversation, Mrs. BESABER asked LOGINOV when they were ever going to get together to play tennis. (Mrs. BESABER had of course previously invited LOGINOV to play tennis with her sometime at the home of a retired American gentleman in Cuernavaca (1.e., Col. Lawrence HIGGINS) who was a good friend and who had an exceptionally good court.) LOGINOV replied that he still wanted very much to play, but that it was always a question of time for him. "Why didn't LOGINOV come down to Cuernavaca next Saturday morning (11 May)?" Subject interjected. He (LOGINOV) and Mrs. BESABER could play tennis in the morning while Subject was working, and then they could all spend the afternoon at home relaxing. LOGINOV replied that that sounded great, but asked what he was going to do with his wife and child. Mrs. BESABER answered that of course they expected him to bring Mrs. LOGINOV and the child with him. LOGINOV said that would be very nice and he'd like to accept the invitation right at that moment, but he was afraid that his schedule was such that he was going to have to hold off on a definite answer until later in the week. OK, and Subject, "will you call me, or shall I


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 189

call you?" Well, replied LOGINOV, why didn't they leave it that if he didn't hear from Subject, he would call Subject, and vice versa. Subject agreed.

7. Subject said he waited until Friday morning, 10 May, to hear from LOGINOV, and when LOGINOV didn't call, he called LOGINOV (confirmed by LIENVOY). LOGINOV, according to Subject, said he was afraid he was not going to be able to make it, after all, because the Mayor of Moscow was visiting Mexico and he would be tied up with the Mayor on Saturday. Subject said he suggested that perhaps they could make it for the following Saturday, then. LOGINOV replied that he thought he might be able to make it then, but, again, he couldn't say for sure just then. "But anyway," LOGINOV added, "we're going to be seeing each other more often because we've (i.e., the Soviet Embassy) taken a house on Calle Umbolt (in Cuernavaca) for the summer, and I'll be coming down to Cuernavaca every weekend." Subject expressed pleasure at this and said that he'd expect to hear from LOGINOV sometime soon then. LOGINOV assured Subject he would.

8. BEWEEP. BEWEEP called Subject in Cuernavaca about 1400 on 10 May. He said he wanted to tell Subject that a Polish musical group was about to open at Bellas Artes and would be playing some of Subject's grandfather's music. (Subject's paternal grandfather was a pupil of Franz Liszt and, according to Subject, is generally regarded in Poland as the second greatest Polish composer next to Chopin.) BEWEEP asked if Subject was going to be in Mexico City the following week and if he'd have time to accompany DEWEEP to Bellas Artes for a performance. Subject said that unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to go, but suggested that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 190

REMEEF bring the musicians to his home in Cuernavaca for an afternoon. BEWEEP said he wasn't sure if they could work it into their schedule, but he'd check and let Subject know if they could come. (Neither Subject nor BEWEEP said anything about the "vacation trip" they discussed on 10 April.)

1. At 0945 hours 2 April 1968, Subject called for Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV and left a message that he was the person who was going to give LOGINOV English lessons. He also left his telephone number: 11-02-88. (This is listed in the reverse directory for Maya Internacional SA de CV; it does not appear however in the current telephone directory.)

2. At 1208 hours on 2 April, Sra. Cora (Inu) tells LOGINOV chat the teacher she recommends for him is 21 years of age, studying for his doctorate in literature in Mexico, and prior to returning to England is willing to give lessons; he is presently giving classes for other PhD's.

3. At 1320 hours, LAMBERT tells LOGINOV that Sra. Cora told him to get in touch with LOGINOV regarding English lessons. LAMBERT would like to talk about it. LOGINOV agrees, but says he is very busy right now and will call LAMBERT at the end of the week to make arrangements.

DATE OF MEETING : 30 April 1968

1.  Subject called me on 29 April and we agreed to meet at the restaurant "Bocana". The meeting lasted from 14:30 to 15:40. I advanced Subject 500 MN for his Russian lessons. Next meeting is at the Bocana at 13:45 on 17 May.

2.  Subject reported that he had gone by the IICMR to inquire about Russian lessons but was totally unimpressed. He gave his name and talked to the Director of Courses whose name he didn't get. He will write up the details for the next meeting.

3.  He then contacted VIDIELLA at the latter's Institute and invited him out to discuss Russian lessons. Since it wasn't a personal matter VIDIELLA suggested that they bring along a couple of the students. Odile MORISSET, a French teacher also came along. They went to Sanborn's cocktail lounge. While talking Sra. MORISSET (she is divorced) invited Subject to her home for a party and said he could spend the night with her is he came. She gave her address as, Paris 7, Apt. 5. Subject described her as ca. 40 years old. Later VIDIELLA told Subject that MORIESET will sleep with anybody and that he usually shacks up with her on Fridays.

4.  Subject told VIDIELLA that he had gone to the IICMR but it looked poor. VIDIELLA agreed, saying the teachers are no good. He did not say that he is or was connected with the IICMR. VIDIELLA suggested that Subject take private lessons from him. Subject protested that he would need accreditation which he could use for further formal study. VIDIELLA said Subject could study with him and then take exams at the Institute which would give him a certificate for that level. He said the Director would be glad to do this. So they agreed. VIDIELLA will give Subject private classes at Subject's afternoon school twice a week from 19:00 to 20:00 on Mondays and Wednesdays. Price will be 50 MN per lesson. Subject paid him 400 MN in advance. The first lesson was on 29 April. Since 1 May is a holiday Subject will go to VIDIELLA's apt. He gave his address as Romero de Terreros 1153 apt. 1 (we had #922, apt. 1) and telephone 43-80-16.

5. In the presence of all VIDIELLA boasted about his great Soviet Friend, Valentino, the consul (this is obviously LOGINOV). The two students and MORISSET all seemed to know LOGINOV personally. One of the students asked VIDIELLA if he had been invited to the Soviet 1 May celebration. He said that he hadn't. He then asked Subject, if he knew any Soviets. Subject answered as casually as he could that he had known one casually with whom he used to go fishing and changed the subject. Subject didn't feel that VIDIELLA VAs fishing for information but I am not so sure.

**SUBJECT: Soviet Cultivation of British Subjects**

1.  It has come to our attention that the Soviets, specifically KGB officers, have been looking around for English language instructors. One KGB officer, Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, is notorious for using this tactic to assess contacts who may be of use to him.

2.  Among the persons in whom LOGINOV is reported to have shown interest are two British subjects:

a. A young student, (fnu) LAMBERT, who is studying for a doctorate in literature in Mexico and who prior to returning to Britain is giving English lessons.

b. Walter James PLUMB, Director of the Anglo-Merican Institute.

3.  It is suggested that you might wish to contact these individuals to determine if the Soviets are indeed cultivating them. I would appreciate receiving the results of such interviews.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. On the occasion of the visit of the local Consular Association to the "Home Fair" on 28 March the undersigned conversed on and off with Jiri SVESTKA (P-7111), Second Secretary of the Czechoslovak Embassy and known member of the Czech Intelligence Service. The undersigned asked SVESTKA what was going on in his country. The Czech launched into an explanation which sounded like a recitation. The essence of his comments was that when leaders have lost touch with the people, they should be replaced. The recent changes in Czechoslovakia would ensure more democracy for the people and would more closely represent their views and take care of their needs. Fifteen years in power, he said, is a long time for a leader. The undersigned pointed out that the recent changes in Czechoslovakia might not please "everybody", SVESTKA agreed that this was bound to happen, but that his country had the right to do what it wanted without worrying too much about the opinion of some of its neighbors. The undersigned then went one step further and pointed out that ULBRICH from East Germany for one seemed to be worried about possible repercussion of the Czech reforms on his regime. SVESTKA said he did not care what ULBRICH said or did and repeated that the Czechs are masters of their country. When the undersigned pointed out that the new president was not a member of the Communist Party but had headed a Czech Division that fought with the Russians SVESTKA agreed that this was a good choice that should please a lot of people. Throughout his talk with the undersigned, however, SVESTKA tried to play down the degree to which things are going to change in his country as a result of recent reforms.

2. Just to test SVESTKA a little further, the undersigned asked him what he thought of the U.S. elections. With a broad grin SVESTKA stated that Senator KENNEDY would undoubtedly be the next president. When the undersigned replied that he hoped not, SVESTKA said, "If I were an American I would vote for him." Valentin LOGINOV of the Soviet Embassy joined the conversation at this point. The two went on to say that KENNEDY was the only candidate for peace and social justice, that he had their moral support and sympathy (this given reports for an intel, report) etc. SVESTKA added that the war in Vietnam was good for the U.S. economy. The undersigned told him that the USSR manufactured more rockets than bathtubs and more machine guns than cars.

1.  Subject is a 26 year old Mexican citizen (although he looks to be in his 30's). He is a Spanish teacher at the Mexican-North American Institute and since the fall of 1967 has held a second job as the director of the Community Services Program at the American School. In April 1967 he married an American citizen from the Chicago area named Donna WEINTHALLER (phonetic). They live at Juanacatlan 15, which is just around the corner from the Soviet Embassy. Home phone is 15-28-49.

2.  Subject was recommended as a Spanish tutor in August 1966 by Enrique GUTIERREZ Martinez (P-12667), who was then C/SB's Spanish tutor. GUTIERREZ was subsequently recruited by C/SB as a utility agent but has since been dropped because he is related to other Station assets. On GUTIERREZ's recommendation, I began taking private Spanish lessons from Subject in August 1966. I found Subject an excellent teacher and continued taking lessons from him until December 1966. In March 1967, my wife and I had Subject as a teacher in Spanish courses we took at the Mexican-North American Institute. I have maintained intermittent social contact with Subject since March 1967, and my wife has become friendly with Subject's wife, having visited her at her apartment two or three times and having had her to our home during the day an equal number of times. I have also

Files: P/2671


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 204

kept informed to some extent about Subject through his younger brother, Javier ARIAS Buerba, from whom I have been taking Spanish lessons since July 1967.

3. Subject was a casual contact of Station officer Olivia C. RAGNITY in 1965 and 1966. than a file card noting this contact, " .... Station traces on either Jorge or Javier ARIAS Buerga..

4. Subject and I from the beginning have had a very friendly and informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with a friendly, open personality and a good sense of humor. Politically, he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths and positive qualities and tends to minimize or overlook negative factors in our society. Subject knows I am with the Political Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Union. We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and Comunism several times, and he has always come out a strong anti-Communist. He has one brother and two sisters living in the United States. The brother is married to an American and lives in Virginia, where he is in the construction business. One of the sisters is also married to an American and lives in California (I believe San Francisco). The second sister is married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago. The sister in California is a naturalized American citizen. The brother and the sister in Chicago are not.

5. On 24 April 1967, LIENVOY reported the following call from GAZIYEV to LOGINOV:

GAZ: "I saw him, he arrived yesterday."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

LOG: "Excellent. Then I'd like to see you to discuss certain things."

GAZ: "Then I can come there tomorrow?"

LOG: "No, better Wednesday."

GAZ: "All right. He usually comes there at 6 o'clock. He got married and came here with his wife. Now they look for an apartment. I'll go there on the 10th, because I want to attend courses in English. This week I'll be busy."

LOG: "OK, until the next then."

6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was probably talking about Subject, since:

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted with GAZIYEV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although Subject told me he had not gone).

(b) Subject had gotten married that month.

(c) Subject had just returned to Mexico with his bride.

(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.

(e) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800 to teach evening Spanish classes.

7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had considered using Subject as an access agent against GAZIYEV, but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was developing into something more than occasional chats between classes. I did not see much potential in approaching Subject before this with onezde the idea of having him deliberately cultivate a friendship with GAZIYEV, as I felt Subject was living


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

such a busy and hectic life that I would get very little out of him. Prior to his marriage, he was keeping such a hectic schedule between his Institute and private classes that he wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the job with the American School (although he gave up most of his private classes).

8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's relations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I attempted to find out what I could about them from Subject. For a number of reasons, however--including my going to the States in June--we were not able to get together until 11 July. On that date I took Subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a little Spanish restaurant downtown.

9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading. I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had developed any further. When I casually brought the conversation around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy, as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that they never talked politics. In reply to an offhand question about whether he had met any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 207

said that he had not. My inclination was to believe Subject, and I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been talking about someone else over the phone or that they had never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.

10. On 1 November 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother Javier in Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee. As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and would like my advice. He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience, he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was in El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security department" about his predicament. What did I think he should do?

11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice other than to tell him that it was entirely his own business whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a "black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew" the U.S. Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

the Soviet Enbassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Babassy
refused to give him any advice, at least it would make a record
of his visit and anyone who was ever interested would his
heart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't
afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.
After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the
States to study sometime, and they might even want to go to
the States to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very
serious, I became more serious myself and told him that just so
he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the proper Embassy
department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had
told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy reception, but
wished the U.S. Embassy to know he was doing it solely out of
curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union.
Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.

12. Seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given Subject the
    invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject
    replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYEV was
    now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his
    own initiative, that he had also been to GAZIYEV's apartzent
    twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said
    that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he
    (Subject) got married (Subject was married about mid-April
1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he
      and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'. Subject finished
      eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had
      his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,
      but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone amther


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

time.

13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our home on 27 November, but the evening was not meant to and did not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further. Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the 7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he felt it was simply safer to stay away from the Soviet Embassy altogether. At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for lunch sometime in the near future.

14. For various reasons, including the poor state of Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, I played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested in anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details. Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered my questions to the best of his ability. It seemed to me, and still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject had not told me on 11 July what he subsequently told me on 1 November (1.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and on one occasion had met another Soviet there). This was that he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too hard (which I didn't on 11 July), he felt more comfortable ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was genuinely concerned not to "get luto any trouble" with the U.S.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

Embassy over attending the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and felt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning the visits to GAZIYEV's home and meeting the other Soviet there.

15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went to Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV introduced the third person as Valentin "something." When I asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject immediately reacted and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV: GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and described JOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening started off very casually, with LOGI NOV expressing interest in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute. LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject if he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to start with, etc. Subject replied that he'd be happy to, although it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometimo soon. LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 211

with "no doubt" that he (LOGINOV) was trying to feel Subject out
on his political views. Subject said that he couldn't remember
most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV
began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't
find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish
than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory
remarks about the extent of American influence in Mexico. Subject
said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so
blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation
and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought
LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was
"100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely
no sympathy with Communism. (While this sounds awfully blunt
and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good
in my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to
be *** a bit blunt at times, and knowing his ideological leanings,
I would not put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject
said that LOGI NOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the
conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject
commented that he had a pretty good idea of what the Soviets were
up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subject
related the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz
a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone knew
the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda."

16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics
    were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 212

Subject said that LOGINOV seemed somewhat irritated with him, but on the whole kept his composure very well and treated Subject politely for the two hours or less Subject remained. As Subject was leaving, LOGINOV again said he'd come by the Institute to see Subject in the near future, but he never did. One day in late 1967 Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by name. However, they did not converse with each other.

17. Subject said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject returned to Mexico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his wife over to dinner (this would place the second dinner in about mid-May). This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only others present, and the evening passed without any reference to politics. Subject saated that he still occasionally goes across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV betweem evening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been to GAZIYEV's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his home.

18. Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose in meeting him was to assess his exploitability, he did not seem to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV was an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I also explained that it was very possible GAZIYEV was using the Institute to spot other candidates for interviews with Soviet


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 213

intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV'S activities and contacts at the Institute. liuwever, Subject said that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself at the Institute and did not have any particudar friends there whom Subject knew about. Subject said he would keep his eyes open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would let me know if he came onto anything interesting. Subject also offered to "play up to" GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance if I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions of appreciation.

19. The question that remains unanswered after all this is, of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject over the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while LOGI NOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took place about mid-May. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV told GAZIYEV on 24 April he wished to discuss with GAZIYEV concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on 24 April, it would appear that it was finally decided that GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase the memory of the first dinner.

French Club. My wife talked to Loguinov at the French Club. There seemed to be considerable doubt about their communication. Loguinov might have said that she had just played tennis, or was about to play tennis, or plays tennis occasionally. It seems likely that she did not play and was not about to play. She probably came to the club for the steam bath. She was in a hurry, possibly to leave the club.

COMMENT

It is possible that Mrs. Loguinov and Mrs. Small are part of a communications channel. Loguinov's haste might have been due to the unexpected appearance of my wife and the risk that Small might arrive while my wife was still in the vicinity.

Extracts from LIREALM-1 contact reports

10 May 1967

LOGINOV played tennis at Mundet with S. S. Abdel Rahman Hassan Abdel-RAHMAN, 1st Secretary and Consul a: UAR Embassy. This was the first time they had played together. (played doubles with LIREALM and his wife).

14 May 1967

LIREALM played tennis at Mundet with LOGINOV. LOGINOV's son Dmitriy was there, speaks absolutely no Spanish or English. Also played with Jacques LEMAIRE. LOGINOV said his wife had had several heart attacks in Mexico and sannot play tennis. LOGINOV said he wanted Dmitriy to learn English, like his sister in Moscow. LOGINOV said he knew Jean BINEAU, when asked if he knew any French diplomats. LOGINOV claimed to have been in Soviet Navy, then immediately entered the Foreign Service Institute and straight into foreign service after that.

17 May 1967

LOGINOV plays tennis left-handed. An instructor commented that he was convinced LOG INOV had played much more than the one year he admits to. The instructor said he had never seen LOGINOV play with an instructor.

20 May 1967

LIREALM saw LOGINOV at Mundet but did not play with him.

25 Jun 1967

LOGINOVA said she was chemist, but did not say whether she had ever worked in that profession. The LOGINOVs never eat any food at the club, but LOGINOV drinks beer there. The week before LOGINOV played in mixed doubles match with 16 year old girl and won won a small silver cup. LOGINOV had a Russian movie camera with him and took pictures of people at the Club. LOGINOV talked to a Mexican named Jose Manuel. LNU, connected with some Mexican ministry that assists SovEmb personnel; LOGINOVA said Jose Manuel was very sympathetic to them; LOGINOV said they had meft at the Canadian or French Embassy.

SOVIETS LOGINOV

Valentin's friends, June 30, 1967.

Contact. My lawyer celebrated his 40th birthday on June 30. Jin and Connie Pollack offered their home at Calero 76 in San Angel for a party for my lawyer. Of the 12 to 14 people at the party the following are part of a group who have organized a Great Books type club. At least once, and possibly twice or three times they have invited Valentin Loguinov.

Doug Wiltshire
Timmie Davis
Alexander "Sandy" Reed
Werner Thurau

Doug Wiltshire, about Masri. Doug claimed that Masri, his partner is pro-U.S. and anti-Nasser. He believes that Masri's wife is the secretary to the ambassador.

THEN MOVED

Werner Thurau. The Anglo-American directory lists Werner as British. My lawyer states that he is actually Danish. He previously lived in San Angel to the Lomas address now shown in the directory. He since has moved back to Aida in San Angel and lives one or two doors from Timmie Davis. He is listed as vice-president of Jeffrey Manufacturing. He is reported to have studied at Oxford.

My lawyer, who is one of the more brilliant humorous-type intellectuals in Mexico has described Werner as the most brilliant person he has met in Mexico. Werner's friends are agreed, behind his back, that Werner is "ill-employed", that he is earning far less than he deserves. His standard of living strikes his friends as austere.

AN OXFORD GRADUATE!

Sheila O'Sullivan Mabbo Thurau. Sheila is the wife of Werner and was not at the party due to illness. She is an actress, attractive, extreme extrovert, and the sometime mistress of Jim Tierney (spelling ?) the former head of the Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico, now at the home office in New York. I have often run across Sheila, but this was the first time I saw Werner.

Werner Thurau, about Valentin. As Werner was introduced to me he acted very surprised. He explained that he thought I was someone else, a friend of his, Valentin Loguinov. He claimed that we


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 218

could be twin brothers. My wife overheard this performance and
feit it was highly overplayoi. My opinion was that this was a
conversation starter, nothing moro. Werner cxpected ne to show
interest in his having met a Russian. I did. Werner then told
ne about the book group. I had heard of it before through my
lawyer and through Valentin. I had never before realized thoy
vere ere and the same group. Warnor spoke of only one occasion
when Valentin was there he did not say there were not other
ecomsions. Valentin spoke of soveral occasions. Werner des-
cribed Valentin as good-natured, narrow intellectually and
curious.

I did not acknowledge knowing Valentin but avoided the issue.
I do not know who knew Valentin and first invited him to the
group. I do not know how often the group meets or where.

Comments

I found Wernor to be very interesting and charming. I have
hold held the the sane opinion about his wife for sone time. I believe
I could develops him if it were of interest.

Werner deserves to be checked. Everyone seems agreed that
there is something amiss hore

I would not mind belonging to a book group-I have in the
past. This one should be real swinging and night have Val as
a permanent visitor.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT : LICOLY-3

DATE OF MEETING : 10 October 1967

1. I met with Subject at the restaurant of the Del Paseo from 09:15 to 10:00. Next meeting to be arranged by phone. Subject will take a months vacation with his family from 28 October to 25 November. He will go to South Africa and other countries in Africa.

2. During the week of 3 September, PRIKHODKO came to Subject's office to announce that he was back from home leave. Subject asked him about the status of the proposed Soviet tourist office. PRIKHODKO said that the Mexican Government had turned it down. Specifically SALVAT had told the Soviets that the tourist exchange between the Soviet Union and Mexico was so insignificant that it did not justify a reciprocal exchange of tourist offices (Comment: Evidentally the Mexicans used the reciprocity issue to deny the Soviet request.)

3. PRIKHODKO also said that Oleg NECHIPORENKO (P-7442) would arrive in Mexico in October and that he would have a job in the Embassy, not in the consulate.

4. While PRIKHODKO was in Subject's office, Senador ECHEVARRIA, the brother of the Secretary of Gobernacion came in and Subject introduced them.

5. Finally, PRIKHODKO mentioned that YATSKOV would be leaving soon PCS (Comment: As I mentioned earlier, I'll bet that NECHIPORENKO replaces YATSKOV).

6. The next day LOGINOV called Subject and asked him to come to a cafe near Subject's office. LOGINOV started off by calling Subject a son-of-a-bitch. He said, "Look at all the contacts you have in Mexico, even ECHEVARRIA'S brother". He then went on to berate Subject for refusing to continue to work for the Soviets. He became quite hoated at times. Subject repeated all the arguments he had used earlier about willing to be friends but refusing to help the Soviets in a clandestine capacity. During the discussion LOGINOV asked if Subject knew the "legal counsellor" of the US Embassy.

By this he meant the Embassy's lawyer, not the legal attache. Subject just laughed at him.

7. On 7 October Miguel ALEMAN Jr. came to Subject and said that he and Jacobo ZABLUDOWSKY had just seen Ambassador BAZAROV. They wanted BAZAROV to make arrangements to get them to the USSR for television coverage of the 50th Anniversary celebrations. BAZAROV had told them that things were very tight but if they went to Subject and he could arrange accomodations, BAZAROV would see that they got to the USSR. (Comment: From LIENVOY we know that the two had an appointment with BAZAROV on 9 October and thay they had been agitating for permits for about a week. I feel that by sending them to Subject, BAZAROV was giving them the brush off. If the Soviets were really interested in seeing them go, they would handle it differently,)

1. I met Subject in his room at the Del Paseo from 1415-1530. Subject will call me a day in advance to set the date of the next meeting, which as usual will be in the Del Paseo.

2. Subject had not seen or talked with CHMYKHOV or any other Soviet since he and CHMYKHOV were out together on the evening of 4 August. At that time, CHMYKHOV suggested that he and Subject have dinner together the next time Subject was in Mexico City. Subject agreed and told CHMYKHOV he'd call him the next time he was in town. Due to Subject's tight schedules on his visits to Mexico City, however, it wasn't until 28 September that he called CHMYKHOV. When Subject called the Embassy, however, he was told CHMYKHOV wasn't in. He therefore asked for LOGINOV, who proved to be in. LOGINOV immediately recognized Subject's voice and sounded very pleased to hear from him. He stated that he had had a wonderful holiday in the USSR (he returned on 27 August), but was now swamped with work. He added that he had planned to call Subject as soon as he got things under control. Subject thereupon said that he was actually calling for CHMYKHOV, because he didn't think LOGINOV had returned to Mexico yet. LOGINOV replied that CHMYKHOV wasn't in just then, but they'd both very much like to visit Subject in Cuernavaca. Subject said that he'd like to have them, but suggested they hold off for a week or so until the weather got better. LOGINOV agreed and said he'd talk to CHMYKHOV

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Erika Cammerman

SOURCE: LICOZY-5

1. On 7 September 1967 I asked Source about Subject. He knows her well.

2. The Cammerman's are Rumanian Jews who came to Mexico about 15 years ago. Eugene was a brilliant man who started with nothing and ended up very wealthy. Several years ago he attempted to negotiate trade between Mexico and Rumania but without results. He died of a heart attack about two years ago.

3. Erika is a charming, intelligent, cultured west-European type. She is not a leftist. She owns and runs INCOMEX at Isabella la Catolica 45 (telephone 18-65-61) and (12-88-32), a wine and cheese importing company. On ca. 1 September she left Mexico to some "bad" in Austria for a month. At Source's suggestion she added 2 weeks in Israel to view the conquest.

4. They have a daughter, Marina, who is stunningly beautiful. Marina met and married a German Gentile in New York for which her mother and family ostracized her. Source does not know where Marina is at present.

5. Although I did not mention my reason for interest, Source stated that if Erika is in touch with Soviets it would only be to get their business. She would not find Soviets either ideologically or personally attractive.

5. Subject has checked with Adolfo de la Huerta of Salvat's office about the Soviet application for a tourist office. De la Puerta had heard about it but said it was not their affair and would be handled by Gobernacion.

6. David KLEINMAN, ca 55 yrs. old, born in Russia recently made reservations to go to Moscow during the celebration of the 50th anniversary. He will go in a private capacity as a tourist. Subject described him as an orthodox Communist and vas particularly galled that KLEINMAN, a Jew called Israel an aggressor.

# THE CONSULAR SECTION OF THE USSR EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY

The consular section consists of three persons:
Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV - consul (third secretary)
Vladislav Sergeyevich KORKUSHKIN - vice consul (Attache)
Vladimir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH - vice consul (third secretary)

With such a seeming-scarcity of work for the Congulate, it would be sufficient to have only one man forit. But the Soviet Embassy has to have three men handling consular duties. The Consulate is open to visitors twice a week and only two hours a day. Even that is too much for an occasional person who desires à visa for visiting the USSR. Eowever, in addition to their regular duties, the consuls have to arrange various matters relating to visiting Soviet cargo vessels, artistic and cultural groups, etc. On several occasions, they had to do izz errands outside of their overt field of activity. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why, in many instances, they cannot be reached on the telephone. 412 three of them speak fluent Spanish and have no difficulty in getting around and acquiring Mexican Friends. Given below Sro thoir respective character sketches.

Consul V. is a rather recent arrival (two yours in realcol and not very expertenced in his job. However, sta Learnin; the monas quite durries a lot of wolgas the cae woord

to be sent for any visiting dignitary or a performer. me,
apparently, scrutinizes and approves the names of doctors and
dentists patronized by the Embassy personnal. Recently a
Man on Duty said over the phone that LOGINOV had forbidden
to be given out the address of a German dentist, whom the
Soviets visited quite frequently before.

LOGINOV is also in charge of making us a duty roster
for appointing a Man on City who would be responsible for
anything that took place at the Embassy on that particular
day. No one, except the ambassador, seems to be exempt from
that duty. On a few occssions LOGINOV encountered hostility
to his arbitrary manner of making up the duty roster. Thus,
when a Man on Duty called Nikolay Sergeyevich LEOFOV, Press
Attache and a (former?) Cultural Officer, and told him that
LOGINOV put his name down as the pesponsible Man on Duty for
the Embassy for that day, LEONOV said that he was very busy
and let LOGINOV do it himself.

Obviously LOGIKOV had made a number of secret enemies
with his dietstorial manners and his disdainful, monotonous,
and slow way of talking. His medium- to high-pitched voice
sounds as if he is extremely bored with the world and cocs
dia inter locuser a faver just be talking to his.

a continptuous smile on his lips. Unquestionably, his typa
of charm appeals to cldorly ladies and LOGINOV is quite aware
that he is attractive to the other sex. Without a doubt, ho
tries to capitalize on it and with his fluent Spanich prob-
ably tries to ensnare Kexican females. Therois no indicat
tion that LOGINOV has tried anything of the sort with the
Soviet wives. One of the reasons may be that he would not
like his wife, Aleksandra Dmitriyeva, a very formidable woman
indeed, to get wind of it. On the other hand, the Mexican
women may seem to be more exotic and attractive to LOGINOV
than his own countrywomen, in especial his wife, who is a
large unattractive female.

Nevertheless, LOGINOVA seems to be quite pleasant, with
a nice cultured voice, and gets along with her husband well
thanks to her good humour and social activity. She has
been quite prominent in Mesthom work and in the children's
summer camp. 2ch Shortly after their arrival, LOGINOV bought
a tape-rccorder for his wife for 115 dollars. Whether it
was to be used for music, or other purposes, has not been
determined.

Once in a while, LOGINOV goes on drunken sproes. Taus,
on 12 Egg Fobruary 1906, he and RORMAIN drove us to
the Embussy gate at three a.m., pounded on the gate, biew
t.sis hora ana aad altercations with scantslev orgzeyevich
BLIC, who was on Caty atas time.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 229

Another very prominent trait of LOGINOV'S character is his extreme chauvinism, bordering on jingoism. In referense to other nationalities, LOGINOV uses such deprocatory epi-ktx thets as: "Amerikashki", "Chidorika", "Nenchura", etc.

It is doubtful if LOGINOV has any true friends. His sneering attitude is probably the reason for it. Although he made overal errors in judgement in his work and social behaviour, LOGINOV by no means is a fool and should be Lept in mind for any possible developments.

Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, vice consul (Attache), is a young man about thirty-three years of age, rantum rather stocky, with blond wavy hair over a high forehead. A pair of heavy-rimmed glasses gives him the appearance of a very intellectual porson. On the whole, KORMUSHKIN has the air of an easy-going fellow, who can make friends almost over-night. KORMUSHKIN and his wife are exceptionally close friends with Anatoliy Vięcimirovich KARABACH, employee of the Commercial Office, and his wife. Soth families visit each other quite frequently.

whenever any of the Soviets or his family is ill. KORNUS-EKIN is also quite active in consular affairs and does most of the leg work for LOGINOV. He is also very active in Hestkom functions, where he is in charge of the Children's section. KORRUSHKIN is quite an energetic and pushy individual and can be quite rude and nasty at times. Undoubtedly, he is looking forward to being a full-fledged consul in time to come. The impression of KORMUSEKIN'S ambition and pushy trait in his character is intensified by the sound of his rapid and energetic but pleasant baritone voice.

A curious fact should be cited here. Shortly after his arrival, KORKUSAKIN purchased a tape-recorder for 185 dollars or 70 dollars more than the one bought by his "boss" LOGINOV. Why?

It seems that in the future, KORMUSHKIN may slow down somewhat, but his inner drive and energy will nevertheless make him a more adroit and skillful individual. His further progress should be watched with interest and caution.

Vladimir Ivanovich SHPAK, vice-consul (third secre-
tary) seems to be able to handle any job that comes his way.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: BREADER 25777

DATE OF MEETING: 27 July 1967

1.  I met Subject from 1522-1645 on 27 July in his room at the Del Pasco Hotel. The next meeting is scheduled for 4 August at 1400 at the Del Pasco.
    Subject will call on the 3d or 4th to give me his room number.

2. Display of Subject's Products. Subject will hold a private exhibition of his factory's latest lines of furniture and artifacts at the Hotel Presidente from 24 August, between 1000 and 2000. Sanborns' buyers will get a sneak preview on Tuesday, 1 August. Subject will consequently be in Mexico City from 31 July thru 4 August. He said he planned to send out invitations to all the Embassys, but had not yet done so.

3. Soliman CHERY. Subject had neither seen nor heard from GORI.

4. Col. Laurence HIGGINS. Subject's wife learned from Mrs. HIGGINS that the Colonel is duo back in Mexico on 12 or 14 August.

5. CHEKHOV. CHEKHOV dropped in on Subject at Subject's home in Cuernavaca about 1800 on Wednesday, 26 July. After hemming and hawing around for a few minutes, CHEKHOV finally said that look, they were friends now and he wanted to ask Subject's advice on a matter. The doctor whom Subject had recommended for CHEKHOV's son, CHEKHOV said, had diagnosed the boy stomach trouble as an advance case of one of the worst strains of amebas and had advised that the child be kept in bed and under observation. CHEKHOV said the child was consequently being kept in bed at home in Mexico City. The doctor, according to CHEKHOV, had also expressed concern that the amebas

Subject by the time I saw him to lead him to decide to tell CHEKHOV, when he called him at the Embassy, to come to the Del Passo (Subject's hotel) rather than the Presidente, where clients and acquaintances might frown at all his Soviet friends. I told Subject to handle it the way he wanted, but just not to bring me a restaurant bill for six ballerinas and their escorts. I told Subject that his near-term objective should be simply to establish as much rapport with CHEKHOV as possible, with the view to finding out what kind of person he is and what he has on his mind. I said he should consider CHEKHOV his main target for the present time and urged him to take advantage of any opportunity to get together with him alone.

7. Subject apologized for his 800 story about his encounter
   CHEKHOV being a bit spotty, but he said he had a hard time understanding CHEKHOV and wasn't able to follow everything he said. Subject said CHEKHOV's Spanish is not good, he speaks very fast, and continually jumps from one subject to another. On the whole, Subject said, he had the impression CHEKHOV was a rather nervous person and much less sure of himself than, for example, LOGINOV. Subject said that whereas he always felt he had to be on his guard with LOGINOV, he felt completely relaxed with CHEKHOV and felt he dominated their relationship.

8. Invitation to ANDREYEV Farewell Party. Subject gave me an invitation he had received in the mail to a despedida for ANDREYEV on the evening of 31 July. (The invitation was formally issued by KAZANTSEV. See attachment B.) Subject said that although he was going to be in Mexico City on the 31st, he expected to be completely tied up with preparations for the opening of his exhibit the next day and unless I had a special reason for wanting him to go to the reception, he was going to have to skip it. I told him that in view of the circumstances there was need for him to go.

P-8777

DATE OF MEETINGS: 13 and 19 July 1967

1. I met Subject at the Del Paseo Hotel from 1350 to 1410 on 13 July and from 1345 to 1530 on 19 July. The next meeting is scheduled for the Del Paseo on 26 July. Subject will call in to arrange the time.

2. GOHARY. On 13 July Subject reported that he still hadn't been able to get through to GOHARY at the UAR Embassy, as the number GOHARY had given him was always busy. I gave Subject three additional numbers from the Diario Oficial and he tried all of them in my presence. He got through on the last one, managed to reach GOHARY, and spoke with him for about three minutes in English. The tone of the conversation tended to confirm BESABER's claim that he is on very close and informal terms with GOHARY. Subject asked why GOHARY hadn't come to his home the previous two weekends. GOHARY excused himself by saying he had simply been too busy, but wanted very much to see Subject. Subject replied that he was in town at the Del Paseo and why didn't GOHARY come up to his hotel room that evening. GOHARY readily agreed to come about 2030.

3. Subject reported on 19 July that GOHARY had arrived at the hotel room about 2050 on 13 July and stayed for two hours. At the conclusion of their meeting, Subject invited GOHARY to come to his home in Cuernavaca with his fiancee on Sunday, 16 July. GOHARY agreed and visited Subject in Cuernavaca from 1500-1700 on the 16th, but without his fiancee, who he said was ill. The hotel meeting on 13 July was by far the most profitable, as it gave Subject an opportunity to talk with GOHARY alone and at length over several drinks. The presence of Subject's wife on the 16th inhibited the conversation.

Subject submitted the attached report (original given DOCS) describing the

help-in. His positive reaction to the idea of talking to the older
American would seem to be confirmation of this.


e. (p. 6) While no future meeting was scheduled, Subject and GCHARY
parted on the 16th with the mutual understanding that Subject would get in
touch with GCHARY either to discuss further GCHARY's'business future or to
arrange a meeting with Subject's American friend.

f. (p. 5) Subject said it was his wife's understanding from Mrs.
HIGGINS that Mr. HIGGINS would return to Mexico sometime during the week of
31 July.

g. Subject said that he thought a sizable amount of money--such
as $1,200 U.S. per month, would be a vital, although not the primary, factor
in recruiting GCHARY to remain in place. The prime incentive, in Subject's
view, would obviously be the opportunity to help Egypt.

4. Contact with the Soviets. CHEKHHOV called Subject at home about
   1000 on Sunday morning, 16 July. CHEKHHOV said he was at the Soviet dacha
   in Cuernavaca and that he and LOGINOV had gone to Subject's factory about 1700
   on Saturday, the 15th, in order to present Subject with three bottles of vodka,
   but the guard had told them Subject had left. (Subject said he left the factory
   about 1630.) CHEKHHOV said that LOGINOV had left Cuernavaca because he was
   leaving for the USSR on vacation, but he (CHEKHHOV) was still around and
   could Subject come over to the dacha. And oh, yes, CHEKHHOV's child was
   sick with some form of dysentery and could Subject recommend a pediatrician?
   Subject said that despite the uncivilized hour, he got dressed and went over
   to the dacha about 1100. CHEKHHOV was overflowing with friendship, kept
   urging everyone from the smallest child to the oldest woman to go up and say
   hello to Mr. BAER, and meekly presented Subject with one bottle of vodka.

Ha er Cained that they had druck the other two bottles. About 1115 or so, Samists benan arriving at the dasha in droves; Subject estimated 20 men and 25 women arrived in all. One of the newcomers to walk in was ANDREY, ho ssered to be greatly surprised to see Subject and to learn that Subject and JOT knew each other. Subject stayed for about 40 minutes in all. CEKHOV stayed with him the entire time and talked incessantly--mostly about nothing and often so rapidly that Subject had a hard time understanding his faulty Spanish.

5. In speaking of LOGINOV, CHAKHOV did say that LOGINOV is responsible for "matters inside Mexico," while he (CHAYKHOV) "supervised Latin American countries outside Mexico." CEYAHOV did not elaborate on or give any hint as to what kind of "matters" he was talking about. As Subject was leaving, CETHOV urged hin to come to the cassy the next time he was in Mexico City and they would have a few drinks. CHAKHOV then said that as a matter of fact he was coming back to Cuernavaca the next weekend and would like to see Subject them. Subject said to give him a call. (NOTE: Subject is unusually busy right now because of his approaching trip to the U.S.--in about two weeks, but told me he would try to get together with GEYAHOV for a drink. I urged him to do this.) In all, Subject said he had the impression from CHEKHOV's general depertment that LOG107 had told him to look after Subject while he (LOGINOV) was gone.

6. Comict Activity in the State of Morelos. Subject said that Cesar TIR, the Jofe de Investigaciones of the Policia Judicial in Cuernavaca came his hore on the evening of 17 July to ask about a room-divider screen made of the turquoise mosaic material that Subject's factory specializes in. MR told Subject that he'd prefer "not to pay too much for it," and Subject being Subject and also hoping we might make it up to him, obli below cost. Delighted, HR stayed on awhile and

SUBJECT: Telecon with LIROBBIN-2 on 12 July 1967 P-11665

1. LIROBBIN-2 called the Station at 1345 on 12 July and left a message for me to call her. I reached her about an hour later. She said she had met LOGINOV at a party at the Indian Embassy on the evening of 11 July. During a brief conversation with him, he told her he was going to the Soviet Union on vacation on 16 July. He also said that PRIKHODKO was going to the USSR on vacation on 26 July. A minute later, he said PRIXHODKO was leaving on 29 July.

2. Subject said he had had no other contact with any of the Soviets since March. (It will be recalled that she invited PRIKHONKO to dinner on 31 March, but he did not come.) Subject said she would call PRIKHODKO in a few days, mention that LOGENOV had said he was going on vacation, and invite him over before he left. She will let me know what happens.

SUBJECT: VALENTIN LOGUINOV P-11712

Music Hall de Moscow

Valentin invited our tennis group to be his guests at the final performace of the Ballets Ruso at the Arena Mexico. The total group was about 15 persons.

Alexandra not present. Val's wife, Alexandra, was not among the group. Val made no comment about why she was not there. No one else asked, that I know of.

Czechs. Three Czechs were among the group. The introductions were badly handled and I wasunable to learnthe identity of the Czechs. Val and they spoke Spanishnot Russian or Czech.

Odile Mauricee. (Spelling not certain for last name).
Odile was invited by val. She is Canadian, about 35, not unattractive, but careless in her dress. She struck me as being slightly masculine. She is a teacher of French in the mornings at the University of the Americas. In the afternoons she teaches at an Institute for Translators and Interpreters on Rio Tiber,

We were waiting for a mutual friend of Odile and val, al Rafael. He never arrived, I asked Odile who Rafael was. She explained that he was a teacher and her drinking buddy. Every afterncon around 4-5 she and Rafael can be found in the bar across the street from the institute.

Odile had been drinking beer, probably quite a bit, prior to joining us that evening. She has lived in Mexico for 15 years. Her French, English and Spanish are fluent. She seemed to prefer French, though I felt her English was better.

She dressed oddly with white bobby socks. She did not fit in with the rest of the group. And I'm sure she didn't care. She seems to go to all Scviet embassy functions.

She might possibly be an intimate friend of Val's, SE if not a mistress, at least an occasional bed-partner. She commented (within the context of tennis, which was the topic of conversation at the moment) that one night Val told her he had to go home early (11 PM) because ba was going to play in a tennis tournament the day.

STAKE-OUT REPORT

11 March 1968

DATE: 8 March 1968

1. I checked the Hotel Prince from 09:45 to 09:50 and noticed nothing unusual. I was outside the Hotel Alfer from 09:50 to 10:30 - nothing unusual. I then checked the Prince again at 10:40 for 5 minutes and noticed nothing.

2. I checked the Hotel Prince at 16:50 and saw two women and two men (Soviets) talking in the lobby. Then at the Hotel Alfer from 16:55 to 17:40. Nothing except a man at 17:30 who looked very European. This man looked into the lobby of the hotel, then into the adjacent garage, then back to the hotel then out of the area. He definitely was not a local Soviet.

3. At 17:40 I went back to the Hotel Prince to see if the entertainers were there. At 17:50 two men left who could be Soviets. I followed them to see if they were speaking Russian. I turned the corner from Luis Noya onto Juarez going east, I almost bumped into LOGINOV who was coming west on Juarez. I recognized him immediately and I felt that he recognized me. I continued along Juarez for a bit and then came back to see where LOGINOV went. I then stood on the other corner of Juarez and Luis Moya for 3 or 4 minutes. At this time I noticed a Soviet across Juarez (at the west side of the Juarez monument). He looked like KOLONTAKOV but with too much hair. This Soviet was taking panoramic shots across Juarez. As his camera approached me, I stepped behind a Kiosk. However, in the minutes before I noticed him, he could have been photographing me. A moment later I noticed LOGINOV about 10 yards from the Soviet. Both saw that I had spotted them. The Soviet with the camera then drifted west, photographed the Juarez monument and went further west. LOGINOV then went off in the same direction. I then went to report the above to CLASTONBURY at the Hotel Alfer after checking that I was not followed. I got there at 18:02.

4. The Soviet had a small camera which appeared to be 8 mm. Thus I doubt if he got identifiable pictures of me.

5. We checked out of the hotel at 18:30. At 18:40 wo saw LOGINOV's car ahead of us on the Reforma headed toward the Soviet Dabassy. Tuo men were in it whom I did not recognize.

6. LILYRIC has LOGINOV and BARANOV leaving the Soviet Embassy in LOGINOV's car at 15:36 on 8 March. Neither were back by 18:30 when LILYRIC secured. I instantly recognized BARANOV's photos as the Soviet with the camera.

7. Also per LILYRIC, LOGINOV left the Embassy in his car at 09:41 and returned on foot at 10:51. This was the period ve were waiting for Subject. However he could not have. soon me at the Hotel Prince since I left there at 09:50 the first time aad at 10:40 the second time.

# CONTACT REPORT

12 February, 1968

1. Agent: LIREALM/1

2. Date and Site of Meeting: 12/2/68, Tecali Bar, Mariano Escobedo, 1700.

3. Date and Site of Next Meeting: Same place, same time, 19/2/68.

4. Administrative: No administrative matters discussed.

5. Information/Instructions Passed to Agent:

Rowton advised LIREALM/1 to continue his same line with his friend Valentin Loguinov. He agreed with LIREAir/1 that since Loguinov did not bring up the matter of his "boss" since his first reference to it at 27/1/68 at the French Club, Loguinov probably has not given further thought to the matter. (Loguinov had two opportunities to bring the matter up again with LINCALM/1 and did not do so).

Rowton also advised LINEAL/1 to continue to push LIRELIC/1 into the PKI but agreed that in the light of the current uncertainty as to whom sight emerge as the future leader, LIRELIC/1 should not attach himself too firmly to any one individual, but rather await the outcome of the 27/2/68 convention.

6. Information/Reports Given to Case Officer by Agent:

LIREALE/1 gave Rowton his reports 050/JF and 051/JF, attached herewith, toge her with the latest LIRELIC/1 report passed to LIREALM/1 through the drop.

VALETTE LOGUEHOV

February 7, 1963, 1645-1815 hours.
French Club

Tato for tennis. Val was 45 minutes late for our tennis match. I take this as meaning that he no longer suspects me of working for the company. Or at least his suspicions have been sufficiently allayed to permit him to risk missing a contact with me. He obviously answers to his earlier provocation.

I am no longer a target. When we talk now, I have the definite feeling that he has neither thought at all about our meeting in advance, nor has he been briefed in advance by his people. Our conversation is spontaneous, inane, and frequently bogs down..

Horative about Gloria Pinto. Val seemed genuinely bored about Gloria. She is not young, but definitely attractive, athletic, sympathetic, and has organized several tennis groups, always careful to include Val. He seems completely unappreciative of her efforts in his behalf.

asked no leading questions and made no provocative policy.

Curious about personnel cuts at U.S. embassy. Val asked if it is true that 10 percent of the personnel would return to the U.S. He asked if I knew anyone personally who would be affected. I stated that the only person I really know at all as Ruth Ortega. I added that the embassy couldn't possibly due without her. Val said considerable interest in Ortega and our ostensible interest in Oxford and my oriental tie

I bring her along for tennis because I explained that my contact with Ortega eat. Mexicana for business not, social, and that she probably was a little too old for tennis.

Economies lectionis. Val was still on the girl phase. He hoped I could recommend some
of US Embassy American girls to him. He asked me if I was interested in girls. I admitted

050-2/JF

February 10, 1960. 2100-0200 hours
Home of Gloria and Popo Pinto

To this dinner. Gloria has organized a tournament. Prior to the first rather she invited all the participants to a cocktail-dinner in her house.

Val late. Val was late, explaining that his wife had a doctors appointment. He also said that he had spent the day at a party in honor of the ambassador who soon will leave.

Val might leave. Val was asked by a provocative German if he too would soon be leaving. Val explained how most people leave after three years, or when the ambassador they have been serving leaves. He said there was a possibility that he might leave, but he refused to express his opinion about such a likelihood.

Party rough on Val. Everyone at the party seemed to want to kid Val, or, in the case of the German, come as close as possible to insulting him. I refrained from this attack. I asked Val if he were always treated as some sort of a novelty at parties, with people attacking him. He said no, but that most parties were diplomats or his own Soviet community. He explained the Germans behaviour as typical of the shortsighted, ill informed and vulgar Germans.

Alexandra. Alexandra spoke little during the evening and needed help from Val frequently to explain what was said in Spanish. However, she seems very intelligent and very calm.

DATES OF MEETINGS: 11 and 19 January 1968

1. I met Subject in his room at the Del Paseo Hotel from
   1415-1545 on 11 January and from 1415-1515 on 19 January. The
   next meeting will be arranged by telephone.

2. The Soviets. As of 19 January, Subject had not seen or
   talked with any of the Soviets since his telephone conversation
   with LOGINOV on 28 September. Subject did, however, receive a
   Christmas card from LOGINOV. With my agreement, Subject sent
   inexpensive gifts along with Christmas cards to LOGI NOV and
   CHMYKHOV, but they weren't delivered until the week of 15
   January. Subject explained that before Christmas, he assigned
   his salesman the job of delivering a score of Christmas gifts,
   including LOGINOV'S and CHMYKHOV'S, around town, but shortly
   after Christmas, found that the salesman had not delivered any
   of them. This discovery caused Subject to fire the salesman,
   who had been increasingly derelict in performing his job over
   the past few months and who, Subject had recently learned, had
   begun taking dope. Subject consequently wrote "better-late-than-
   never" notes on the cards accompanying the undelivered gifts and
   had his new salesman deliver them. I have instructed Subject to
   leave the initiative for the next contact up to the Soviets.

MEMORANDUM FOR : COS

FROM : C/SB

SUBJECT : Policeman Recruited by LOGINOV

1.  In reviewing LOGINOV'S SPR which WEENING has just completed, I note that LOGINOV recruited this policeman 5 19 months ago and that his first requirement was on the BOESTROM couple. At that time we gave LITEMPO-8 traces on LOGINOV saying that he was a dangerous KGB officer. LITEMPO-8 subsequently mentioned that the case was continued and that he, himself, was directing it.

2.  If you think that LITEMPO-8 will cooperate, I would like to know the following about this case;

(a) Is it still active?

(b) Did the policeman pass info to LOGINOV on the BOESTROM couple? If so, what? Was there any follow-up?

(c) What type of requirements has LOGINOV given to the policeman? Are any Americans involved?

(d) Have any other Soviets been involved with this case?

(e) Who is handling him while LOGINOV is in the USSR on vacation (he left Mexico on 16 July and ituned. S.)?

3.  As a basis for discussing this case you could mention that we are especially concerned about LOGINOV because he specializes in US operations. He tried to recruit a chauffer at the Embassy and tried to develop a female Foreign Service Officer (true). You might also say he is running a sensitive case into the US (false). Thus many of his requests to the policeman may be in support of American operations although this would not necessarily be apparent. Therefore we would like to know what he is asking for. Our traces would help both ourselves and LITEMPO-8, etc.

4. Depending on LITEMPO-8's reaction, you might even suggest that LITEMPO-8 take advantage of LOGINOV's absence from Mexico in the USSR to request Relacciones not to give him a new visa because of his intelligence activity as detailed by LITEMPO-8.

He mentioned that NIKOFOROV and KORMUSHKIN had had a car accident. Also that NECHIPORANKO had arrived but that either he or someone in his family had been sick ever since arrival.

4.  LOGINOV used the occasion to renew the old pitch. He said that with the celebration of the 50th anniversary everybody is contributing. What would LICOZY-5 contribute? Subject then gave LOGINOV a pair of sun glasses with a built in transistor radio (as a Christmas gift). LOGINOV said he meant not personal favors but something for the cause. He then asked Subject to spot a Mexican employee of the American Embassy. Subject laughed at him and repeated all the old arguments about not working for the Scvs. He told LOGINOV that, if he wanted to be friends, then stop bringing up these old requests.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Berta *NAVARRO*, Member of Fuersas Armadas de América Latina (FALA)

SOURCE : LICOZY-5

1. Source stated that Subject is the sister-in-law of his old friend Lic. Juan *SALDAÑA* who used to be in Relaciones and is now Sub Director General of Accion Social of the Departamento del D.F. Subject is the sister of SALDAÑA'S wife, Fernanda and is 24 years old.

2. A few weeks ago SALDAÑA brought Subject to Source asking the latter to give Subject a job. Subject told Source that she had formerly worked at UNAM and had been arrested in a group which had bombed the Bolivian Embassy in Mexico. She was held and interrogated but because of SALDAÑA'S influence, she was released after 2 months without charges. However, the police refused to let her work at UNAM and told her that they would have to approve any job she undertook. She still has to report to the police every 3 days. Subject told Source her story because she know that the police would check with him.

3. Subject told Source the following about herself and the FALA:

a. The FALA has 76,000 members.

b. Her superiors told her that the PCH tipped off the Mexican authorities about those involved in the bomb throwing. The PCM did this because terrorism is against their line and harms the peacful diffusion of Communism.

c. The FALA works on the coll basis so that each member knows only a few people. However, whe worked as liaison between Moxico and Poza Rica and knows more members there. The FALA mombers in Poza Rica are Pemex workers.

d. The FALA is financed by the Cuban Embassy.

.: Operational Meeting with LIMOON/1 (P-IME)

DATE OF MEETING: 24 November 1957

1. The undersigned met with LIMOON/1 on 24 November from 1200 hours to 1545 hours at an in-town safe house. From 1205 to 1245 the meeting was conducted in L/1's car inasmuch as the safe house was occupied during this period. The next meeting is scheduled for the same safe house on 8 December at 1500. hours.

2. The following meetings between I/1 and the below named Soviets occured during the months of October and November:

a. Classes of 3 October: BEDRIN (P-9037) and GONCHARENKO (P-9379) studied on this day from 1530 to 1700. KAZANTSEV (P-880) studied from 1700 to 1800.

b. Classes of 5 October: In the morning of this day, an unidentified Soviet phoned Mrs. ROCKET (L/1 was out of the house) and requested her to inform L/1 that there would be no classes that day. No reason was given, either then or subsequently, for this cancellation.

c. Classes of 10 October: BEDRIK & Concharenko studied from 1530 to 1700. KAZANTSEV came at 1610, interrupting class, to pick up several pocket books which he had previously asked L/1 to procure for him. L/1 selected them from his own library. KAZATSEV stated that he did not care what subjects were chosen; he wanted them only to improve his reading ability. He did mention, however, that he preferred not to read books which had either violence or pornography as their central theme. L/1 brought a book on science fiction (Kaz. was not particularly interested in this), a book on ballet, and a book on the FEI/which KAZANTSEV seemed very interested. V said that he would not be taking class today and that they would all discontinue clases after 12 Cet. V stated that he was supposed to take his vacation

and commented that they would be too busy with the upcoming Olympics and 50th anniversary. L/1 noted that although LIKI was not necessarily interested in the books given MALINOVSKIY, he was interested in obtaining books of a hydrographic nature. BEDRIN has previously remarked that he related a good spicy story and that during a 1963 layover in Brussels, he (reportedly) sought out and enjoyed seeing some sex movies there.

6. Classes of 12 October: (Last class until 14 November).

BEDRIN and COLOMLINO studied from 1530 to 1700. KAZAKOV did not study. BEDRIN told L/1 to come to the Embassy near the end of October in order to pick up his invitations for the 7 November anniversary. L/1 mentioned that he might be going to the States during the last of October. BEDRIN asked L/1 to bring him two 7 inch recording tapes and two 5 inch reel tapes. BEDRIN commented that "another friend" had previously brought him some tapes. This was the frist time BEDRIN had ever requested L/1 to perform any personal favor.

3. On 31 October L/1 drove to the Embassy to pick up his inviations. L/1 met by BEDRIN who gave him two inviations. L/1 commented that he was not now planning to motor to US. BEDRIN stated that he did not need the requested tapes inasmuch as a "friend" had purchased some Grundig tapes for him while in the States.

4. On 7 November L/1 attended the Soviet celebration. L/1 was not accompanied by his wife since he had to teach classes that evening and therefore stayed only from 1700 to 1830 hours. By his own testimony, L/1 consumed some 14 shots of vodka during this period, yet managed to teach two classes that evening. L/1 agreed that the classes were conducted in a voluble spirit. L/1 was met at the gate by GORLITSYN who passed him on to LOGINOV. LOGINOV commented that he was still interested in possibly hiring Enrique GRIMMAN as an English language teacher for his son. In the reception line L/1 met IVANOV and wife, who introduced him to the new military attache (name corrected by L/1) with whom he had an animated discussion.

conversation in Spanish. The military attache spoke very good Spanish and indicated to L/1 that he would probably begin to study English within the next few months. The mil. attache's English was very poor. L/1 then met BEDRIN & GOKOMIMIMO and had the usual cocktail chatter with them.

BEDRIN and GOKOMIMIMO, in turn, introduced L/1 to FIU GOLOVCO, allegedly a representative of the "Ministry of Culture" of the USSR who, in that capacity, was accompanying the Soviet Ballet on Ice troupe. GOLOVCO spoke in fluent English with L/1 commenting that he had studied English in the USSR. His home is Kiyev. L/1's impression of GOLOVCO was that GOLOVCO did not appear to be the "cultural type". GOLOVCO was very imprecise as to his actual role and duties with the Ice Ballet. GOLOVCO's dress was somewhat hap-hazard and he impressed L/1 as somewhat unrefined and a heavy. GOLOVCO, according to L/1, is about 40-45 years of age, 6'1" in height, 160-165 pounds, grey hair and thin-faced (angular).

L/1, emboldened by a few vodkas, requested two tickets for the Ice Ballet from GOLOVCO. GOLOVCO politely acquiesced and said he would get two of the best seats. L/1 was then introduced to the assistant director and the director of the orchestra by GOLOVCO who translated in a seemingly suave manner. With this show of friendliness on the part of the Soviets, L/1 then decided to invite them all to his house for a buffet supper within the next few weeks. GOLOVCO and his associates were visibly pleased and L/1 also extended the invitation to BEDRIN. BEDRIN said he would try and make all the arrangements and a tentative date of 9 or 10 December was agreed upon. L/1 was then introduced to the Ethiopian Ambassador, Gaitachiwa DIMALE, with whom he conversed in English. DIMALE has good English facility. DIMALE appeared to be on good terms with a number of Soviets and know BEDRIN quite well. DIMALE is tall and thin, pronounced Negroid features, and possesses a strong, forceful, dynamic personality. L/1 and DIMALE had a friendly talk and then parting left open.

the possibility of meeting together socially. As L/1 was having the Soviet
Embassy, the/Translator protected him, spoke from the group he was con-
versing with, and walked over to L/1 with whom he proposed a toast and they
drank to the USSR.

5. Beginning with 14 November, the following classes were held:

a. Classes of 14 November: GONCHARENKO arrived 10 minutes late for classes at 1540. He informed L/1 that neither KAZANTSEV or BEDRIN would be available for classes that day. Then, apparently as an after thought, GONCHARENKO commented that he would not attend classes either.

b. Classes of 16 November: L/1 met GOLOVOCO who gave him two tickets for the Ice Ballet. BEDRIN and GO CHARINKO entered at 1530. At 1620 KAZANTSEV entered and interrupted the class to announce that he would not study that day. Immediately BEDRIN wheeled around and told KAZANTSEV very explicitly that he should remain and study. To this KAZANTSEV replied in English, "See the pressure my Chief puts on me!" It was quite apparent that BEDRIN was in charge of the language lessons and that KAZANTSEV was seemingly very hesitant to defy BEDRIN's challenge. (C.O. note: This may signify that BEDRIN's rank is considerable more than a Second Secretary within the internal organization of the Embassy). KAZANTSEV stated that he wanted to take a week's leave, but in deference to BEDRIN's wishes KAZANTSEV finally remained during the rest of the class, although his presence was a somewhat disruptive factor. GONCHARENKO, who had remained silent for the most part, became somewhat bored and dispirited by KAZANTSEV's antics and therefore exited the class at 1640 - some 20 minutes before the end of the lessons. BEDRIN and KAZANTSEV remained and L/1 had them ask each other questions in English - an exercise which KAZANTSEV enjoyed in that his English is superior to BEDRIN's. However, B DRIN rose to the occasion, comported himself in a fine manner, and there ensued a lively exchange of answers and questions on non-controversial topics.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 276

c. Classes of 21 November: BODKIN and GONCHARINKO studied from 1530 to 1700. At 1700 KAZANTSEV entered together with KORNIYCHUK. KORNIYCHUK possesses good, fluent English although his grammar is quite rough. He speaks with a decidedly British accent. KON YUNIN commented that he had served in Burma (approximately from 1962-65) and more recently (1965-67) had been working in Moscow. KORNIYCHUK is married and stated that he had been in Mexico some four months. KORNIYCHUK appears to be between 35-40 years of age, blonde hair, trim, athletic appearing, approx. 6 feet tall and weighing between 165-170 pounds.

d. Classes of 23 November: BODRIN and GONCHARINKO studied from 1530 to 1700. GONCHARINKO commented that his wife and two children were ill with the flu. KAZANTSEV and KORNIYCHUK arrived at 1700 and studied until 1800. During the lesson a slight argument or difference of opinion arose between KORNIYCHUK and KAZANTSEV over what the official Soviet position was during the 1954 Cyprus crisis. (L/1 could not recall the substance over what they differed on). L/1 then queried them as to what the official position was on the present crisis. They both replied that they didn't know as yet what the "position" of the USSR was on the current Cyprus dispute. The exchange reflected the obdurate, somewhat dogmatic, character of KORNIYCHUK. L/1 characterized KORNIYCHUK as possessing very strong and fixed ideas. KORNIYCHUK did not appear to be awed by KAZANTSEV's position and spoke openly and forcefully to him. Upon departing L/1 spoke with LOGINOV regarding the possible employment of an English teacher for LOGINOV's children. LOGINOV commented that a Soviet English-speaking teacher/employee was now coaching his son. L/1 had recently met a KGB contact through William (?) Plytn, Director of the British Institute.

, a British study, as he was in assuring the .tholom. although L/1 were new he did not know, he was .for him during the Nave meeting and moved on to Lonney a strong recommendation as to Johnson's credentials. (Ron Son is a lawyer by profession and is unmarried). Rooney became more interested in Johnson and told L/1 that he might be able to use his services in two of three months. The undersigned instructed L/1 to obtain more bio information (full name, etc.) on Johnson and to monitor the progress of Johnson in attempting to obtain a teaching position at the Embassy.

littre this day: busy with recooming
anniversary arrangements and Olympics.

Requited that they be given lessons
following day. This was not possible for L/1.

SOKOLOV (P-11167) came into classroom after departure KHUDIN & SOLOMONKO and began talking to L/1 in English. L/1 assessed GORLINSKIY’s English as being fairly good and capable of carrying on a conversation. GORLINSKIY said that he preferred to study English alone rather than in a class or with a tutor. GORLINSKIY commented that he would be required to take his English exam in Moscow in the near future (time not specified) and that he would closet himself off for one week while he prepared for it. GORLINSKIY stated that he wanted to "maintain his 20% bonus" by passing this English exam. L/1 views GORLINSKIY as somewhat of a bumpkin; not particularly intelligent, but a plodder; and a loner in his relationships with others – as far as L/1 can discern. MAKSIMOV was not able to attend classes as he was to accompany a group from the international diplomatic community on a special tour to the Musatan. LOGINOV (P-11712) also spoke briefly with L/1. LOGINOV asked L/1 if he would have time to teach his son (8 or 9 years old).

English, in the company of another Soviet boy, between the hours of 1900 and 2300 any day of the week. L/1 stated that these hours were impossible for him, but might be able to arrange another time. LOGINOV said that he would give this consideration. LOGINOV then began talking of his love for sports and his background as a former judge in Olympic skiing as well as refereeing, various other sports including tennis. This was all discussed against the backdrop of the Olympics. LOGINOV’s English is good, although not as fluent as MAKSIMOV’s. LOGINOV only pretending not to be a laconic.

LO(il)UINOV, Valentin P-11712

November 2, 1967. 1130 hours.

Casual contact. Loquinov was entering the French Club as I was leaving. He asked me to stay long enough to play a couple of sets of tennis with him. I had to decline due to previous commitments. We both agreed to look for each other for tennis some day after the 50th anniversary celebrations next week.

November 11, 1967. 1100-1200 hours.
Source: Direct. At French Club.

Tennis. Loguinov and I played doubles with two women. Everyone seemed to permit themselves to tease Loguinov about the embassy's celebration of the 50th anniversary and about the numerous requests that everyone seemed to have made for gifts and souvenirs from Russia. Val has signed up for a tournament of mixed doubles which begins tomorrow. I too have been invited and accepted.

Attitude. Loguinov seemed very friendly and anxious to continue our friendship. His motives, however, seem strictly for tennis.

Companion. Earlier I saw Loguinov playing tennis with a rather tall and heavy-set person who left when Loguinov approached my wife and me. Later, when dressed, this person passed by to say goodbye to Loguinov, in Russian. He is obviously an embassy type.

November 12, 1967.
Source: Direct. At French Club.

Loguinov played tennis with still another member of his embassy. We did not have an opportunity to talk on the courts. We did see each other in the showers. He showed great interest in playing soon and said he would call me to arrange the date and time. He joked that I should bring some of my friends from the embassy, all of whom are CIA. We could have an international tournament. I told him that none of my friends played tennis. He misunderstood and thought I said that I know no-one at the embassy - he looked disappointed. I corrected him and said that I did indeed know embassy people, but that none played tennis and that I doubted very much if my friends were CIA, FBI or anything else.

# CONTACT RECET

SUBJECT: IBAGON/1

PLACE, DATE, TIME: FIRE REST., 20 aug., 1615 - 1800

1. Subject was fifteen minutes late for the meeting scheduled for 1600 hours, claiming a terrific hangover and admonition, having spent most of the previous night with REI, driving. (Possibly his eyes were very clear, but then he is quite young.) I am quite sure that immediately upon his arrival and after making his explanation for being late he added that his car was in the shop for repairs, but at the end of the unproductive meeting he walked to his car parked only half a block away from the cafe. I walked with him and commented on his earlier remark regarding repairs but he denied saying anything about it.

2. Subject had not yet seen LUBAN but said that he planned to attend a party allegedly to be given by Laila (not Sergio's wife,) at which time he will attempt to elicit info re LUBAN's recent trip. Incidentally, Subj. stated that Sergio OLMOVICI had returned to Mexico 3 or 4 months ago. (It had been my understanding that Sergio was still in Moscow.) Subject has not seen either of the OLMOVICHS' for several months.

3. We chatted to great length about many innocuous topics, Russian literature, Mexican food, etc. At one point I attempted to have him work on LOS ...s Day, but he begged off, referring again to his exhaustion, etc. However, rescheduled a 1000 hour meeting at the JEF cafe for Monday. Subj. promising to be in good condition enabling him to tackle the Pat at that time. (Personally, I am not in favor of doing this sort of work in a restaurant.)

4. During our discussion of Russian literature Subj. asked me if I could get him a copy of SOLZHENITSYN'S "GULAG ISLANDS", xxxxxxiii in Russ, I said I would try.

5. Subject is going to try to get away for a short vacation in Acapulco sometime in Sept. and he hopes that I can join him. I made no comment.

6. While waiting for Subj I was reading "Sports Field" which I threw on a chair when Subject ... asked me if I were interested in hunting and fishing and when I replied in the affirmative he quickly came up with a "brilliant idea-" He said he has a student and American friend, who is studying Russian, and rabbit fisherman. He thought it would be a terrific idea... for him to introduce this man, John Smith WELD, to me so we could hunt and/ or fish together. I told him I was not ready for this sort of thing yet, perhaps later.

7. Subj has got room 203 in Italy but has a date with him to the Hacienda Hotel Calle Liverpool, on the 28th of August. Apparently he is very interested in the row. School teacher is arranged by Mr. S. very interested in the row. He said: "I have to go to Moscow, or any other country for training we are asking him to do, but hopes he can become more active at this time. I told him he is to do your training."

He said that type of activity would require much and everything. I asked him to be consistent for this time, and not to talk about this time, or anything for training. He laughed and left saying he understood perfectly.

8. Q.K.M.Z.S. Subject is a strange, vague, with a tendency to wander off into related topics. (Probably because of a con erg station. To leave every one alone and so he is certainly. He went to the cafe and began a serious briefing as to what was meant. He is the early for me to tell whether he can be brought

down cut of the clouds to face reality an! ! I imajine a rather dull daily existence. I think he would like to be, and moto is, an avid reader of literature. Ferhaps he entertains thoughts of becoming a writer someday. He apparenti enjoys puting any a good deal of alcoholic beverses.

Contact Report
Subject: Jimmy SABORI (2-13,530)
Date of Meet: Aug 5 at Continental Rest from 2000 to 2330 hrs.

1. The meet was prearranged and S came on time. The purpose of the meet was to debrief S on his meet with LOG which took place the previous evening and proceed with the filling of the PAQ as well as to give necessary opt instruction. The purpose was achieved.

Next meet: August 19 at the same time end place.

2. The fact that LOG started the meet with a talk about books appeared to S to be curious. No doubt that LOG was peddling some Communist ideological tid bits, especially, justification of Sov International policy. Briefly, too much freedom is not good: Americans and their foreign policy is naive: they worry more about the world opinion than about their national interest: If they want to do something they consult everybody and everything to find out an ages old act that noby can satisfy everybody; Nixons trip to Rumanie was outright a provocation aimed at Sov Union, except, if it was a product of naavenese.

3. S was really surprised to hear LOG giving up so easily on the matter of the US Emb phone directory, but he was outright disappointed when LOG stated that he nor any of Sov Emb officials would want to meet with RNG. Further, S was shaken up when he directly told that he was to be Sov agent assigned to collect info about Red China and Nat Chinese policy concerning Sov - Red Chinese conflict from a Chinese Emb official. Although, he did not mention it to WALD, it was obvious that S did not like at all the idea that big money was spoken but there no mention of money right now, i.e. during the period "S will be working on winning TANGS confidence".

4. P reminded S what he told him at their previous meet concerning his involvement with the Chinese and said that if it was not clear then what P meant LOG spelled it out in clear terms. S. contented that he did not want to go to see RNG before spelling to S, because he wanted to follow our instruction. This was said to please P on one hand and on the other.

other to appease his (S) own fear from the cere possibility that something
might go wrong and he would have nowhere to turn to. F told him that
going to TANG ONLY in connection with the matter of publishing the article
could do him no harm; denying having contact with LOG recently is not
sufficient; TANG could bring up the questica for an estensive purpore
of wanting to send a message to S Sov friend and the fact of not seeing
each other during the past 2 - 3 weeks deans nothing masie-nothing, be-
cause s is supposed to be able to reach a friend; S must be ready to
meet any question by TANG not by denying previous statemente but by
emphasizing that he was thinking carefully about what he told TALIC and
he reached the conclusion that that would gettize him in a situation
he was never before^in and, consequently, knows nothing about possible con-
sequences; therefore, he decided to keep out a field he is ignorant in.

5. As for as the other requiremente concerning the chinese are
   concerned, 2 told S te do nothing for the time being and, especially,
   to keep may for trying to ascertain the ames of Mexicans working in
   the chinese a. should clei that he was spending his time on trying
   to get the name of the next rcsidential candidate before the Fresident
   sends the name of the candidate to PRI for approval. Further, I can
   always be no more surry than Lon was to get him as answer on the
   platinun decl.

6. In spite of his reactions concerning the business part of tis
   meet, S was flatted with Lom invitation to spend a day with his and
   are Janly in Cuantia "to celebrate his birthday together", asked F
   would it be appropriate if he and Josephine took a present to re. 200,
   as for example, a silver breach or something siziler. told him that
   the maximun te could take for rs. ICG and the toy was a box of chocolatte

   it.

8. At the end of the meet S stated that he did not have his cer this evening because Josephine needed it. F told him that he was willing to pay him a taxi, but he was not able to give him a ride. F is quite sure that the car which S uses is Josephines and that it is on s' disposal only when she does not needed. Further, ifs ever wanted to identify P's car it is extremely doubtful that he would hellvertured lato setting excuses in an evening with such lousy weather as it was last nicht.

good job, which he appreciated, but he must be very cautious because the
Chinese are clever people and extremely suspicious.

6. In reply to S' question LOG stated that for anyone of them (Sov
   Emb official) would meet with TANG, because that it too dangerous. S que-
   ried what was dangerous about it and LOG stated that there was always
   a chance that they (TANG and LOG or another Sov) might be seen together
   and that would be very bad. S went on to tell S that it would be his
   job to develop friendly relations with TANG ot possibly another Chinese
   official and slowly obtain from him the info LOG and his embassy needed;
   LOG will guide him as to how to go about it and if they show confidence
   in & he will have it made and Sove ( LOG used the expression: VE ) would
   pay him very well for that job. & commented that he had believed that
   what he was doing he did out of personal friendship with LOG and not
   for money. LOG smiled at $' statement and added that in addition to meney
   they (Sovs) enable & to travel to Éov Union and have a vacation on the
   Black Sea.

7. While & was thinking whether to say something or keep quiet, LOG
   told him that the next time he went to TANG he should limit his conv
   to the publishing of the article about Nat China and if needed deny
   that he had any contact with his sov friend (LOG) since he met TANG, S'
   job is to win TANGS confidence and that is a slow process with the
   Ohinese. Then, in answer to LOGB question & stated that there were to
   Mexicans ( a woman and a man ) working at the Chinese Emb. LOC told him
   to get their names and addresses. S commented that this was not se simple
   as it sounded, because one cannot just ask a person what was his name
   and address. LOG commented that even this was a matter which cannot be
   rushed, first get their names and later obtain the address.

8. There was another thing & should dos find out how many Chinese
   live in Mexico Oity and detoreined whichonse were the influentialone and
   among the latterones determine which are the most influential; he con
   etart working on this by dropping in a better Chinese restaurent and
   trying to develop acco Boquaintances, it can do assumed that those who
   go to restaurante ere people who have money and those who have money aro

usually influential. S agreed with LDG and expected LCG to tell him that he would pay for the viafting of Chinese restaurante, but LOG kept quiet.

9. S had no intention to skip the talk about money and he told him that the publishing of the article about Nat China may end in a blind alley if TANG does not supply at least a half a page of advertising. LOG did not want that to happen and he told S that he (LOC) would give him ΜΝ 1,000.- if the printing of the article should be held because of lack of advertising. S brought to LOGS attention that half of page of advertising brings to Pierre (RUDIAN) 1,500.- pesos. LOG felt that he would pay that money as a price of keeping the door open to the Chinese Emb for S. To put some coating on the pill S added that he would try to obtain an ad or two from Ohinese restaurants, but he daoubted that the owners would be interested in advertising in a magazine which is far from being well known. Just the idea that $ conteplated going to Chinese restaurants pleased LOG's ear.

10. LOG was interested in the status of the Presidential race and S told him that it narrowed down to four candédates and that all the indications were in the direction that ECHEVARRIA was to be the official PRI candidate. S believed that by Aug 20 he would know the name of the candidate. In reply to LOG's question S stated that the candidate will be publically known Sept 15-20.

11. LOG wanted to give more time to be positive of the name of the Presidential candidate and he decided that their next (business) meet would be on Aug 25 at the same rime and place. LOG immediately added that he did not forget that I birthday was on Aug 15 and that he believed that it would be the best if they celebrated together in Cuautla on Baa Aug 16. LOG added that on that day his wife and son would be with him in Cuautla and S should bring along Josephine, Log will bring a bottle of "Russien" champaign and pic-nic style food; there will be bottle of Vodka for Jisephine and a bottleof ( r does not remember what ) for S plus the book te previously mentioned. LOG added some more description about what a wonderful day they would have together. They are to meet in Cusutla about 1000 hrs at the bence. LOG will be there without fail because he will pick up his son who is now attending the "Russian school"

in Quernavaca; the son speaks only Russian and English and LOG is looking
forward to the fact that his son will be obliged to speak english all
day: LOGs wife speaks a little Spanish and there will be no problem for
her and Josephine to underetand each other. S promised to be there.

12. Lest moment assignment for S: LOG hold an info that TANG speaks
    Russian. If S succeeds to verify this fact LOG would like to know where
    did TANG learn Russian.

5. Administrative (salaries, accountings, etc.)

Subject mentioned near the close of the meeting that he owed me $600 (US) for the TV set which COIGNE had obtained for him. I said that I thought this was a gift but Subject said no, he insisted on paying for it and would do so shortly. Meanwhile, a part has burned out and he can not obtain a replacement in Mexico because this particular model is not made in Mexico. He will call in with the details and I will try to get it for him.

6. Information/Instructions passed agent:

None

7. Report/Information received from agent: (use back if necessary)

Subject had been in Europe and Israel for several weeks since our last meeting. Nothing of particular interest developed on this trip.

Before he left, Subject was invited by NECHIPORENKO (P-7442) to celebrate the latter's birthday (which happens to be 4 Jury). Subject tried to beg off but NECHIPORENKO refused to take no for an answer and actually came to Subject's apartment with KOSTIKOV to bring Subject to NECHIPORENKO's apartment. Since NECHIPORSKO's wife was away, three girls from the Pianitsky Chorus were awaising the tarse men. Considerable drinking was done and Subject said it was obvious why they had asked him since the third girl needed a partner. Her namo was Nina BUCHAROVA. Subject said that all of the girls were quite attractive and "available for anything." Subject said that he under- stood that most of the girls in the Chorus fit this category and that they would simply wait until their housemother was asleep before going out and getting some action.

Subject and NECHIPORENKO actually have a good personal relationship. (see attached sheet)

Subject Bolved a mystery of where OLSTETNER van during his recent visit. Subject had not GESTETNER at the airport and bad sined and diued his family during Boat of the time that GESTETIER van hero. No sonder GESTETNER had no time for LISTYS or anybody else.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 295

#7 continued

Subject believes that NECHIPORENKO is very intelligent. He speaks the best Spanish of any of the Soviets known to Subject and due to this facility as well as his looks, can pass for a Mexican. Subject believes that NECHIPORENKO was given the task of cultivating and attempting to re-recruite him after LOGINOV failed. Subject had some interesting comments about LOGINOV (P-11,712) which seem to jive with other comments which have been made about him. LOGINOV had apparently originally been given the task of re-recruiting Subject. When he failed, he felt rebuffed and has since been very cool towards Subject. Subject believes that LOGINOV either has or thinks he has been given bad marks by his superiors for having failed with Subject. LOGINOV is probably jealous or NECHIPORENKO who has at least managed to retain Subject's friendship. Subject says that LOGINOV is not dumb and that he uses his good looks to great advantage particularly with women.

Subject has recently had some dealings with IVANOV (P-1612) who is furious for the following reason: Formerly Soviets leaving Mexico would take KLM or Sabena to Europe where they would pick up Aeroflot the following day. KLM and Sabena would pay overnight hotel costs. Now, however, the Soviets are picking up Aeroflot in New York. Because of scheduling, however, they still must spend at least one night in New York. The airlines will not pay this and IVANOV wanted Subject to cover it. Subject refused for the very sound reason that it did not make sense for him to pay $20 for selling a $127 ticket from which his profit was only $9. IVANOV became furious and Subject yielded by agreeing to pay for IVANOV's accommodations and he said he would do it for those becoming as friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but he would not do it as a general rule. While Subject was away, however, his wife went overboard and got IVANOV four rooms (for two people). Now Subject is furious.

On 31 July Subject was visited by PRIKHODKO (P-2270) who came in carrying a copy of Pravda or Izvestiya. Subject quoted the old saw, "There is no truth in Pravda and no news in Izvestiya," and PRIKHODKO got mad claiming Subject was acting very unfriendly by making anti-Soviet propaganda. PRIKHODKO was very serious. This is probably as good and as accurate a thumbnail sketch on PRIKHODKO that we are likely to get. PRIKHODKO, who said that he was leaving in September, had visited Subject to find out what Subject knew about a congress of Jewish intellectuals which is to be held in mid-September in Bogota to discuss the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union. PRIKHODKO wanted to know whe was going from Mexico. Subject told PRIKHODKO that he had not heard of the congress but would check into it. He did check with someonw at the Israeliac Enbassy to was bor:ified to learn that word had gotten our since at this time knowledge of the congress is confidential. Subject told me that he would tell PRIKHODKO that he had been unable to learn anything, reasoning that to tell him about it would get him involved with further requirements and would be working against the best interests of the Jews. I told Subject that I agreed completely.

Subject said that the Sputnik group which was due in June never did get Mexican visas and their trip has been cancelled. On the other hand, a delegation of about a dozen Soviets is due in August for a Congress of eye, ear, nose, and throat specialists, and stili another group of a dozen is due in September for a congress of soil mechanics. Since these are official delegates as opposed to the sputnik group who vere tourists, they will have no trouble getting Mexican visas.

Subject himself will be going to Budapest from 1 to 7 November for the IICA congress. Subject is world chairman of this group which apparently is the International Convention Organization.

Subject has received several letters from the Sputnik translator de meet on his recent trip to the Soviet Union. She had received the dictionary that he had sent her from Rose and the art books ho had Beat her from Lexico but not a pair of glasses he had wont ber by KLN. Subject will look into this, he la obrlously quite fond of this girl and appeared to be aceking my Peancurance that pho was nat a KGO provocation, I repeated that I had dald boforo which is that the possibility she is should be considered but that under

Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-15.850)
P-11,712
Date of Meet: August 1 at Restaurant INN Le Olub and Bonaparte Bar from 2000 to 2540 hrs

1. The meet was prearranged and S came on time. The main purpose of the meet was to have fill the PAQ on LOGINOV (P-11,712), which wae accomplished to a satisfactory degree, i.e. 26 pages out of 53. Further, FERNALD wanted to check what S has done or prepared for his next meet with LOG which is scheduled for Konday Aug 4 at 2000 hrs (this will be covered in the following paras).

Next meet: Tuesday August 5 at the Restaurant-Bar Jontinetal at 2000 hrs.

2. On Friday Aug 1 at 1400 hrs 3 called on OKINAKSIEN TANG, Minister Counseler of the Nat Chinese Emb at his office. The purpose of the call was to explain that the magazine La Mision goes to press the latest on the 18th of the month and it was too late to have anything gablished on Nat. China. In accordance with the instruction 3 received from Pierre RUDIAN, 8 told TANG that in publishing such articles the magazine writes them according to the wishes of the embassy of the country about which they are written. Because embassies pay only the subscription, they usually see to it that at least a half of page of advertising is in-cluded in the same issue.

5. TANG expressed understanding for such a practice and stated that he was interested in having published article on the Republic of China and probably one on Chian-Kay-Shek and that he would see to it that a proper amount of ada be purchased.

4. TANG went on to ask which embassies are subscribers of the magazine and which use it for publishing articles. S stated that prectical-ly all embassies are subsoribers and almost all of them had their articles published at one time or the other. TANG, apparently, was not astiafied with this answer and he asked point in blanc was the Sov Embassy a subi soribor.

Whan Ranawood affirmatively. TANG arred & did he know anybody


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 297

in.the Sov Embassy. 8 stated that he was on friendly terme with an
official of the Sov Embassy. TANG commented that this was unsual, because
Sove make frends with nobody. S stated again that he had no other way
of calling his relation with the. Sov official than a personal friendship.
In reply to TANGS question 3 etated that he prefered not to mention the
nase of his Sov friend and TANG asked what position did 88 Sov friend
have. S replied that as far as he knew the Sov official was quite high up
(610). TANG continued his questioning: what was the nature of S relation-
chip with the Sov, was it a business type relationship; how often des they
see each other; where did they meet. S stated that he never transacted
any business with the Sov and they meet about twice a month for a dinner
or lunch in various restaurante. S added that the Sov plays tennie every
week-end and that he (2) sometime goes to watch him playing (Note: the
latter statement is not true). TANG asked did 8 play tennis and he an-
swered negatively.

6. At this point 3 asked was he interested in meeting his Bov friend
   and TANG stated that he was. Then, S asked aka TANG whet should he say
   to his sov friend. TANG commented that this was a good question and he
   told $ that he would think about it. Consequently, he asked & could he
   pass by on Monday or Tuesday (Aug 4 or 5 ) and 3 said he would.

7. In reply to Fe question 5 stated that he intended to tell LOG
   exactly what tranpired on his meet with TANG and that he planned
   visiting TANG on Monaday so that he would be able to tell LOG did TAND
   decide to meet LOG.

est
8. P told 8 that he was going too far in pleasing LCG and was
getting in a deeper and deeper mess by setting involved with the Nat
Chinese, it was obvious from the attitued of Mr. TANG that he read him
through and was taking his time to find, could he benifit. something out
of the whole scheme. Therefore, S should also take it easy and not
rush to see TANG on Monday, 1.e. before seeing LOG: further, he should
stick to his previous decision that it was rather dangerous to be
ceoting with LOG often.

9. 8 felt that LOG would press for a meet with S as soon as possible
   once he got to know that CANG had opened the possiblity of wanting to
   meet with LOG. P considered this to be possible and impressed on 8 that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 298

it was up to him to stall.

10. At this point S asked P would we help him out if he got in troubles on account of his acacciation with LOG. F replied that he was trying to instruct him how to keep out of troubles and it appeared that 3 did not care much about what F was telling him. 3 reacted quite strongly to Fe statement by saying that F was wrong, or at least incorrectly interpreted S attitudes as far as he (3) is concerned he is willing to discontinue meeting with LOG immediately, if we tell him to do so. F answered that if we wanted him to drop LOG we would had told him to do it. Nevertheless, S as an American is certainly aware of the fact that the US Service and, consequently, the US security is getting nothing out of S collaboratton with LOG, in view of the fact that LOG will remain here only about 2 mothe more we felt it would be the best to leave the matter take its normal course and find its natural end, we were and continue to be interested in keeping out of trouble, but to achieve this the most important thing was that he carry out our instruction as he received it, we badly need that 3 fullheartedly comply with our instruction; if &' association with the KGB (sic) continues after the departure of LOG we would probably be willing to continue our relationshir with 3 only if we were able to count on his sincerety and complete complying with every instruction he moy receive from us. S stated that it was clear to him that he could not count on any help from us if he got himself in trouble by acting on his own. F left it at that.

11. As the working part of the meet ended about 1040 hre 3 stated that he was broke and did not anticipate to be in a better financial condition for two additional monthe. 8 turned this theme one way and the other until he came out with the request for about 50.- Dollare. F answered that he would look into the matter and we left the INN Le Club and started walking. 3, was obviously fearing that the meet would brak up and he would go home without any money, andis complained that the place ( the INN) was good for writing purposes but the food was lousy (true) and no drinks were served and that if he was not broke he would hed invited P to a brandy. P reacted by offering a brandy. Once at the bar 3 naked & could he give him some money this evening. I felt it would serve no purpose if he stalled more and he gave 8 X6500.- ond obtained the anen.

Date of Meet July 30 at Restaurant Firenze at 1630

1. Prearranged meet to which L-1 came 10 min early. The meet lasted 2 hours and 30 min.
   Next meet: Wednesday Aug 6 at the same place at 1630 hrs.

2. L-1 came to this meet in much better shape than he was last time in spite of the fact that he complained of being tired. He wanted to eat something, but he did not feel has having a full meal. He had 4 drinks (Rum and soda).

3. L-1 handed me a personality sketch which he prepared on DROVIM which is not much by itself, but it could be useful for personal assessment of B.

4. I questioned as much as I was able without tipping my hand, about his visit to the Cov Emb on July 9. I detected no indication of deception nor withholding of info on his side.

5. In the course of debriefing L-1 on his meet with LCC I made my comments and gave him necessary instruction, which are covered in the following paras.

6. As L-1 mentioned LCCs questioning about LIVAL-1 he immediately pointe: out that the whole thing made no sense to him after LCGK repeated statements at the last meet that he was not interested in LIOAL-1. I told L-1 that it made little sense to me, except, if LOG wanted to ascertain was L-1 selling him the truth. Then I added that I wished LOG-1 had made some statement which L-1 could relay to LOG to see what would he his reaction. L-1 commented that once in the past he told LOG that LIOVAL-1 told him that he used to know a Sov diplomat here whom he considered to be his friend and was disappointed when the Sov diplomat tried to recruit him, because it was obvious that the friendship was a pretence. LOG heard this he laughed and said that this rescue of the old clumsy methode which are no longer used. (NB: I did not know about

7. thie fact and would appreciate whether it is contained in the files)

With regard to Victor I. FAMOS P. (or A) there is little to be caid which was not mentioned in the Attachment 1. Fie calling card had the following phones printed: 46-77-17; 46-15-78 and on the bach was writeen 32-08-95. I en not inclined to take at the face value LOC's statement that he knew nothing about ACS, especially, in view of the fact that MACS ought to be attending the IICHK for some time to be able to speak some Fussian and prounced well. -l is willing to make the translation SAMOS wants if he finde no difficulty in handling the terminology.

8. LCGS reaction on 1302' plan to show the Sov film at the CP center at Versailles appears to be interesting.

9. L-l was again puzzled with LOG's hints that L-l should do something for the Socialist cause genuinely dislikes the idea of getting involved in the EGF work. I told him that I also did not want him to get avuived in spying for GB but I did not want him to be cast aside by Sov uliciale; tress will be things I-l can do to show the good will end what he dees dru amount to nothing as is the care with the showing of the Sov film: the rost important is that he does nothing without checking with me.

10. According to L-1, LCG never before remealed his political way of thinking as much as he did in his statements concerning the excessive freedom in the USSR and other Socialist countrier.

11. In answer to my question L-1 stated thet be brought up the questica si not being invited by LOG to his apt, becauce on the previous meet. I asked him whether he was ever in LCG house. This correct and I acked 2-1 this question having in mind the filling out of the FAQ. I sax in L-l's agenda under Aug 8 LCC address plus 1900 hrs. ! told L-1 that if he is received by ICGe as a friend that it will be necessary that he (L-1) give a feremall dinter for LC at his plece. is a matter of fact before breaking up the evening L-1 should ask Lot and his wife which date in Sopt they would be able to come to L-Is Loure; he will add he would appreciate if Los bo it along one or two sov coupler. 100 este who else would be there f-l will state he did not par hair done else, but if it wisher to be ree willing invite anyone ICG curgentes.

Purpose of this suggestion from the point of our interest is quite obvious.

12. After the debriefing I asked - to start filling out the IAQ and it 10 pages were completed. The work was going slower than I anticipated because it is not only a matter of translating but also explaining the questions.

Subject: LIBACON-1 (P-4805) - LOGINOV (P-11,712) Meet
at Restaurant Fonda del Retiro on July 28 at 1500 hrs

1. The meet was prearranged and L-1 was in front of the restaurant 4 min before LOG. The meet lasted about 90 minutes.
   THEIR NEXT MEET: Friday August 8 at LOGS Apt at Ignacio Esteva 21/2 at 1900 hours.

2. No cocktails were taken before the meal and with the meal beer was drank. LOG lead off with questions concerning L-le family, health, work and entertainment.

3. Ammong questions concerning L-l's work there were also questions concerning LIOVAL-l: was L-l giving him classes regularly; was LIOVAL-1 asking L-l questions about the USSR or Sov officiale; did LIOVAL-l make any statements which would show how he breates politically" (sic). L-1 gave routine answer pointing out that LIOVAL-l does not hesitate to speak about his family matters and work, but he never seks questions of any kind; be takes his language classes regularly; there were no statements concerning political matters.

4. L-l told LOG that July 24 or 25 a young man Victor I RAMOS called on him in the evening at home and told him that he needed a trane-lation of about 20 pages of Russian text into to Spanish ard that he was sent by LOG and he asked him who was the person. LOG stated that he did not know the person and since it was a matter of translation he (LOG) sent him to L-1 hoping that he may earn some money by making the translation L-1 asked LOG did he know that RAMOS spoke some Russtan which he learned at the IIORM. LOG stated that he was not aware of that fact. L-l will make the traslation if he can handle the terminokoły dealing with economy.

5. L-1 told LCG that he spoke to 3, MUNOZ about the Sov film and that MUNOZ was pleased with the offer. Due to the fact that KUNOS is presently undergoing a treatment he was not able to make arrangemente for showing of the film. In reply to LOG's question L-l stated that MUNOZ wanted to show the fils in the Communist Party Centro (sio) at

Versailles, LOG exclaimed that for Heavens sake he did not anything like that; he wanted this to be entirely on private and personal basis without political elements involved; to show the film at Versailles would be stupid, it would just enable the imperialists to blast in the papers that the Sova were getting involved in internal political matters ef Mexico, in view of the coming Presidential elections this could be blown up into a ecandal. L-1 remarked that he saw no difference in showing the film in the OPCentro or in the Centro Asturiano as LOG wanted originally. LOG explained at length the difference and L-l promised to have another talk with MUNOZ.

6. L-l told that LOG that quite recently he saw in the press some- thing written to the effect that there are presently in the USSR 4 types of detention ( concentration ) camps and he wondered whether that was an indication that the freedom in the USSR was being trimmed again. LOG stated that "this was pure imperialist propaganda". He went on to say that in the USSR the cafes are full of people and that one can hear them even critisizing the government. He added that in his opinion there is too much (demasiado mucho) freedon in the USSR and other Socialist countries If Stalin was alive it could not happen that while the people in America are openly protesting against the war in Vietnam and against imperialism a Socialist country as Ozecho rizes its people in favor of American and West Gernam empirialiom. "Too much freedom in the USSR results with still more freedom in other socialist countries; this is no longer freedom, it is a shameful betraial of Socialism; I hope that it will de realised soon that Stalin was right", eaid LOG.

7. At this point LOG worked in a hint to L-l that he should do something for the Socialist cause. L-l sounded his old tune saying that he eaw nothing he could do and added that now when LOG opened him the door to the American Intelligence Service through Victor RAKOS (actually working for the Economist Intelligence Unit, S.A., Reforma 116 - 801 B) he would find out would they pay him well and if they would he would work for them, because anyway the Sove never gave him anything. When LOG asked him what the hell he was speaking about, L-l stated that he was km joking and LOG commented that L-l had never done anything to help the Sov effort and consequently, they were not able to pay him anything.

nover invited him to his house, while at the time he had met BROVKIN he was invited to Bs house after they met the second or third time. LOG told L-1 he had no intention of keeping L-1 away from his house, but he wanted him to know that since the time BROVKIN was here certain things had changed: previously the Sov Embassy was paying the rent for the apts of their nofficials and now the officials have to pay the rent from their salary. Consequently, LOG lives in a small, modest apt and he does not feel that it is adequate for receiving people. L-1 commented that LOGs statement made him feel bad because he believed that they were friends and that formalities were not necessary among them. LOG counter-acted was by saying that L-1 and his wife were invited to his apt on Wed July 30, but he did not want L-1 to be surprized to see in what kind of apt a Sov Aipl officials was living. L-1 thanked for the invitation and stateu that it was impossible to him to come before 2050 hrs on Wed because he had late classes. LOG felt that 2050 was rather late and they agreed that we L-1 and his wife would come to LOGs for dinner on Friday Aug 8.

Subject: Jimny SAPORI (2-13,870)
Date of July 22 at the Raffaello from 2000 to 2325 hours.

1. This meet was held in lieu of the one scheduled for the previous evening to which S did not come. In the course of the morning of July 22 I tried to reach S by phone at his office but he did not come there. In the afternoon he phoned to our office and left the message to call him home. I called about 1625 when I returned from another ops meet, but S was not in. Josephine told me that he would be back in 30 minutes. Then I called at 1700 hrs Josephine told me that S called from out and told her that he was going to the airport and that I should call about 1800 hrs. At 1815 hrs a maid answered the phone and told that S was out but would return home soon. At 1900 hrs the maid gave me the same answer. At 1930 hrs Josephine answered and passed the phone to S. We arranged this meet.

Next meet: August 1 at the Chez Le Club at 2000 hrs.

2. S did not go through much of trouble to explain the reason he did not come to the meet the previous day. He said that he did not write in his notebook the time of the meet and he went to the Reffaelio at 1400 hrs just to see whether I was there; in the evening he went to movies with Josephine "because, anyway he was not sure when we were supposed to meet. I listened to his explanation without comment.

3. Inevitably, the moon landing was the first topic. S spoke about his excitement while watching the event on July 20 in the evening and he concluded that 200 congratulated him on the great American success and explained the failure of the Luna 15 by saying that it must have landed on a rock and toppled down. At this point I asked S when did he see 200 and he answered that they had their meet on Friday July 18. Willy-nilly I had to ask S how could 200 congratulate him on the successful moon landing which took place two days later. It took a second or two until S told me that 200 extended his congratulations by phone. It is possible that a meet with 200 took place as was scheduled and there was no talk about the moon landing, but S' emotional description of the feat carried to the statement about 200's congratulations. It is also

that S met with LOG on son evening (July 21), i.e. at the time S was supposed to meet with me and he did not have the guts to tell me that he left me waiting and he went to meet with 107.

4. I went to the debriefing of S on his meet with LOC. Foet of the aspects of that meet are self explanatory. Nevertheless, there are new inter-sting factor concerning S' future meets with LOC. It may be noted that S requested less frequent meet on basis of suggestion I made to hie during the brief meet of July 18. Another factor is the rattling of big money.

5. There are facts which are naive and contradictory as for as LOG is concerned. LOC will work out a plan which is to provide security to their personel meets on one hand and on the other he invited S to come to the French Club..... 100 did not appear a serious operator if he felt that I was able to lead in convs about military strength of Red Chine.

*ALDAIN*

6. The previously heralded friendship between LOG and boils down to a buble. On the other hand zy attempt to debrief S on the activity of res just a little better then nothing. (Till prepare a separate Attachment).

7. As the attachment 1 shows I discussed in detail the question of S' phone calls to LOG on July 10.

ATTACHMENT # 1
July 24, 1969.

1. JS steted without hesitation that he phoned to L on July 10, 1.0. the day their meet took place.

2. JS believes that he made his first phone call (the one recorded by LIENVOY) about 1100 hrs. Be wes told to call in an hour and he DID CALL more or less an hour later. Then, he was told that LOC wee still busy and that he should call in 30 minutes. JS CALLED AS HE WAS TOLD and ester quite bit of waiting LOC came to the phone. Consequently, JS made THREE calls to the same phone number.

3. All THREE calls which JS made were anmered by time same nale voice. There was no indication that the male answering the phone recognired JS voice in any of his two back calls.

4. JS recalls that when he made his second call and stated that it was "Vladimir calling" the operator understood that "calling" was the second name and he asked JS konto spell it, which required some explain-ing.

5. JS is positive that at no time during his 3 calls he mentioned any kind of second nece.

6. English was spoken at the request of the operator.

Comment: Apart of the fact that the meet did take place.

July 24, 1969

Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-13,830) Report on
Meet with LOGINOV (P-11,712) on July 18 at SEPe-Paris

1. The meet was prearranged and it lasted about two hours. The previously used procedure was followed: S and LOG met in front of the restaurant and they entered it together. As usually, LOG was sharp in appearing at on the spot.

THEIR NEXT MEET: On Aug 4 at Samborne Insurgentes-Tasquena at 2000 hrs.

2. Qourse of the Meet.

LOG asked S why he did not come "to play tennis with him" at the French Club on July 12. S explained that he was not feeling weli and that he did not recover completely from the flu which he had all week. S added that only for the reason of keeping the word given to a friend (LOG) he came to this meet. Nice worde by LOG who concluded that he brought S 2 bottles of Votka which can be used as "a medicine" for colds and similar disconforte.

3. As it could be expected after such an opening of the meet LOG was interested was S able to accomplish something for him. 8 told him that he had done what he promised and gave LOG the written report which LOG read. When he finished the reading LOG remarked that 8 did not sign the report. When & said that he was willing to do it right there, LOO said that it was not necessary and that he was only joking.

4. LOG spent considerable amount of time in questioning 8 about the ressons, consequences which the cancellation of PEMKX contract(s) with some US oil companies. At certain point the questions lacked ciarity and 8 asked LOG point blane what was he driving at. LOO stated that 8 should realize that the USSR is the second largest producer of oil in the world (sic) and that he was interested in finding out was it possible for the USER to step in where the Americane kicked out (sic). S told LOG that it was difficult to go core wrong than LOG was in his thinking. because if Mexicane dak did not want Arericans involved in their oil business it was positively certain that they wanted no foreigner, г-

LOG commented that the USSR was very much interested in establishing strong economic interchange, especially trade, with Mexico and they were not finding the right atmosphere nor proper response in Mexico. He asked S what, in his opinion, sould or should be done to overcome this situation. S answered that he beltoved that the Bovs ought to change their mentality if they wanted to trade with Mexico, naimly, in the field of trade they should forget about Socialism and adapt the Capitalistio mentality: to trade with Mexico 50vs would have to establish industrial plante here and to do it Mexicens must have 51 per cent share in each case, which means the controling stock; in reality this does not mean that Mexicans would invest 51 per cent of the value........

# 6.
LOG went to the other item of the written report and he asked S how he went about in contacting Ohin-Hsien TANG, counselor of the Nat Chinese Zab. S told him about posing as a reporter for the magazine La Mision and going there on reccommendation of Pierre KUDLAN ( Fee FERNALD'S previous contact report). S added that in the Sept issue of the magazine there would be an article dealing with Nat China and the Poiking - Moscow coflict and if needed another artcicle on Ohing-Kai Shek would be published. LOG told S that he was pleased with the manner in which S handled the task he gave him. LOG did not discuss the contents of this part of Ss report and he questioned S about CETANG: he wanted to know was S in a position to keep this acquaintance alive and develop it in to a sort of friendly informal relationship, he (LOG) knew TANG from some formal diplomatio gatheringe and he liked the person. S believed that he was able to keep alive the established acquaintance and was not able to guess as to tow far he would be able to develop it. LOG suggested that B do not allow too much time to pass until his next visit to TANG. S said that he could call on TANG on Fri July 25 to explain him that he did not succeed in getting the article in the Aug issue of the magasine and will publish it in Sopt issue, at the same time S will make it knowa that ho wee interested in getting the material for an article on Chiang-kai Check which should keep the doors open for another visit.... S was in hie element when he was describing this and LOG was not finding enough. word to praise & and at the same time to encourage his to all he can


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 310

to bring his relationship with TANG to a point that LOG could meet TANG in a friendly unofficial manner. LOG concluded that for such a job he was willing to pay $ in terms of thousands of Dollars. After the dust of verbage settled LOG told 8 that he should try to feel out TANG was he willing to speak about the military stregth of Red China. LOG explained to S that presently the Sove were completely in dark as to the military strength and operational organisation of the Red Chinese army, they have no way of acquiring the info because even if they had friende in Red China none of them dared to maintain contact with Sov officiale nor officials of other Socialist countries which are known to be on the Sov side; Nat China has many spies in Red China and they are well infced on all aspects of developments in Red Chinas it is possible that TANG would be willing to make arrangements with his government for exchange of info, especially, military info between the USSR and the Rep. of China and this would be beneficiary to the USSR and the USA. LOG went on to tell 8 that he should think in terms of using RUDIAN for getting to meet TANG out of hie embassy: be that a party or whatever might be needed, the expenses will taken care of by LOG, because money is no problem.

7. Then, LOG stated that 8 should arrange something to enable LOG to meet RUDIAN in a small, family type, oirole. 8 was cought by surprize and told LCG that he told him that he and RUDIAN were quite often seeing each other. LOG stated that he knew RUDIAN well and was in may instances with RUDIAN at receptione and other formal social functions, but he never had an oportunity to be with RUDIAN in friendly and unformal circumstances. $ commented that the only problem he found in trying to make such an arrangement was in the fact that RUDIAN often, sometime even twice in a week, drops in to see 8 at his (Josephine's) apt but he never announces hia visits in advance more than an hour or two before he comes.

8. LOG asked 8 what happened to the US Emb phone directory; did the girl (friend of 3) return. 8 answered that he did not have the slightest idea what was going on, "because in his condition (of health) he did even go to check did the girl return".

9. LOG was proposing that they meet in the course of the next week bus & told him that he felt that they were meeting too often and in view


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 311

of his status of a tourist it may be assumbed that the Gobernacion carry
out spot checks on him; if he was to be seen by the Gebernacion or Security
agente in company of LOG it is prety certain that they would take him
in and interrogate him; he thinks that this can be avoided if they do not
see each other so often.

10. LOG agreed with S' reasoning and added that he himself realised
    that they were getting together too often and he also cannot be 100 per
    cent sure that he is not tailed some-time. Therefore, he will out a plan
    by which they will be able to see each other whenever it is needed and
    will limit their regular personal meets to twice per month. He went on
    to tell $ that he would pick up an apropriate spot on which S will place
    a chalk sign when he needs to se LCG urgently: LOG will pass by the place
    every morning and if he see the sign he will erase it which will assure
    Sthat he understood his request and they would then meet the same evening
    at a place (restaurant) which they would select only for this purpose.
    SOG concluded by stating that this was the general idea and that he would
    work out the details which he will explain to 8 on their next meet which
    they would hold in two weeks, i.e. August 4.

11. S commented that. the plan looked good and if LOG was sure that
    it would work then there was no need for them to meet more than one a
    month. LOG stated that 2 meets per month were needed in spite of the
    fact that he was positive that his eystem was dependable.

12. S told LOG that he did not spend any of tha MN 400.- he gave
    him for the purpose of establishing contact with an official of the
    Nat Chinese Emb and consequently wanted to return the money. LOG told
    him to keep it for himself and that he would give him money, as much as
    needed, if he had an oportunity to entertaia TANG.

13. There was some unconsequential talk and LOG told S to come
    to the French Club any Saturday and that he would teach him to play
    tennis. LOG explained that he was going to the club every Saturday
    about 1000 hrs: 8 will be allowed to enter if he says that LOG was
    waiting for him.

Platique con el sr. Tang sobre el problema de Russo-Chino on la-frontera del rio Ussuri isla de Dacansol llamada en Chino Txenpao.

El cree que Fas Tse-tung en realidad necesita tanto una diversion de sus problemas internos como consolidar el Ejercito Rojo un en-emigo para unir al pueblo. Ya que los Estados Unidos es un cuento viejo y que no arienazan sus fronteras, el más logico es la Un-fon Sovietica. Los terrenos que reclama son realmente Chinos pues en el añð 1847 Zar Nicolás I lo ró anexar Rusia la cuenta del -rio Amur y en el año 1853 arrancaron a China la margen norte del-also rio. Mao Tse-tung ya so fué más allá de lo que pensaba y para el ya no hay retorno. Si sa recresa, pierde tanto al ejercito Rojo asi como la union del pada weblo. Ahora tiene que se-uir adelanto solo que el camino que laduce a la cuerra, en el traso de San Petescurge lusia echo 13 10 da otro 70 -11 kilómetros cuadrados de la China occidental de la provincia de Sinklang. Asi qua en realidad el probleza de la isla de Chenpao no está circunsorita a olla, que en si no vale la pena.

Le pregunte a que lado estan ellos en este probleza y el ma respondlo," al lado que más aos convenga". Le dije que al lado de 20-no tiene un aliado y con el jamas volveren a Caina. Ellos tiene -un departamente estratejico que estalla con quiene y cuando as al-mejor tiempo de regresar y con quienes ais les conviens.

Date of Meet: August 26 at Chez Rene at 1400 hrs

August 26, 1969.

1. The meet was prearranged and S came on time. The meet lasted two hours and 30 minutes.

2. URY Meet: Sept 8 at the same place at 1400 hrs.

3. S apologized for not bringing the copy of the report he gave to AEDIEHARD: he did not think of it this morning when he left the house.

4. I told S that the fact that DEDIEHARD would remain here at least five additional month did not please me, because I was not able to let the things go the way they were going until now and be just an observer. In reply to my questions S stated he was ready and determined to anything we tell him to do: he is willing to drop the association with ABDIEHARD; he is equally ready to do or tell ABDICHARD anything we instruct him even if it was certain that AZDIZHARD would drop him; he is willing to go through any doings we consider necessary. I believe S was sincere in his statements.

5. I told S not to call under any circumstances before their next meet (Sept 10); keep away from the Chinese Emb; if he gets the add from Luau Restaurant S can advise JONG by phone; take proof of the article as was promised but avoid any cony whatsoever, if Josephine feels like going to the French Glub on Sat (Aug 30) S can go with her, but I see no point in him going along alone. S stated that he understood what he was told and he would not do a move without checking with me.

6. S asked in a matter of fact tone that he would like to know where he stood with us; did we want him to carry out the work we request for patriotic reasons; do we intend give a salary or make a worthwhile present. I told him that he can rest sure that we realized that he was not in a financial position to be able to work out of patriotic feelings, and consequently, could be paid for his work as much as it is worth to us.

7. No next incident: According to the statement of Dr Enrique BOLAÑOS Cacho, cousin of GDO with whom GDO plays domino every Tuesday

Subject: Jimmy SANORI (P-13,830) Report on His Meet with AEDIEHARD (P-11,712) on Aug 25 at Samborne-San Angel at 2000 hr

1. The meet was prearranged and it lasted 90 minutes. No changes in the pattern of meeting and A came on time.

THEIR NEXT MEET: Sept 10 at the same place at 2000 hrs.
S was invited to come on Sat at 1030 hrs to the French Club with Josephine. S not sure he will go.

2. A apologized for not going to Cuautla on Aug 16. Lots of nice worde about thinking about S and Josephine all day that rainy day.

3. A had a suprise for S: few days ago he received orders to remain in Mexico at least 5 months more (sic). When S aked was he not pleased with the order, A stated that he was practically packed up and he had made plans regarding the places he wanted to visit and it was pleasure in unpacking and so much less he liked the idea of cancelling his plans. S asked several questions about A's wife and A was giving normal answers. Ati no time did A belittle his wide and he stated that she was 40 years old.

4. S handed to A a written report on what he accomplished with the Chinese. A thanked for the same and told S to get the article published by all the means; do all possible to get the ad from the Luau Restaurant, keep in touch with WONG or TANG but make sure there is a bona fide reason to go to see them, example, to tell them that the ad was obtained, show them the script of the article before it is published and similar; be very careful because Chinese are highly suspicious people.

5. Then, A asked S why TANG was not listed in the Dip List. S stated that it was evident from TANGs calling card that he just recently arrived here. A accepted the explantion and told S that WONG was listed in the Dip List es a counselor and that he (A) had confused TANG with WONG and that it was WONG who spoke Russian.

6. At this point A handed to s an envelope containing MN 500.-
   and he told & he wanted him to have that money for accidental expenses


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 321

while cell seting info for A. S pretended he was hesitant to receive money but did not drag the story long ( from fear that A might change his mind ).

7. After the brief "ceremony" about giving and accepting the money & asked S did be have any news about the US Embassy Phone Directory. S reminde A that he told at their last meet that he had no way of getting it. A asked S did he know anybody working in the ME USIS. When S answered that he did not think so A told him there was a number of girls working for USIS, they work on the 3rd floor (of the End building) and several of them live in the Hotel Geneve; they carry out some propaganda; A is not sure "how far" can one get with them (in terms of having good time), but there is no problem of getting them (although, the interet is limited to one girl) to go out for dinner and dancing. This is something S should look into. S commented to the effect did A have an idea how much it tekee to take a chick like those for an evening of good time; such a bill runs about MN 700.-. A replied that money was no problem; if S lines up something it is enough if he phones him a day earlier and he will bring him the money.

8. At this point A gave S the following instruction: If S ever needs something from A, as money, or he has something for A he should call the Emb and state that he wants to speak to Vladimir of the Consulate and stress that it was Vladimir calling. If A is in his office he will take the phone and there will be "just mucho gusto de saludarle" from both sideas. If A is not there he(s) is to request to give the message that Vladimir called. The call should be made in the morning if possible. Regardless, whether S gets to speak to A or not he is to go the same evening at 2000 hrs to their meet place at Samborns-San Angel.

9. said S he would see what could be done and asked A was it possible that he was not able to do anything about the platinum. A apologized that it skipped his memory to tell s that he spoke to their Commercial Counselor Viktor IVANOV (full name mentioned by A) about the matter and that VI wanted first to know through which Swiss bank would the transaction be carried out; terms of the deal the buyers propose and be advised that Sova were not interest in any deals which would be less than 1 million US Dollars. As soon as 8 submits the info, S and IVANOV will start work- ing on the deal: if IVANOV leaves before the deal is closed it will not


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 322

affect the deal because IVANOV will be able to back it in Moscow. S
commented that it sounded good and that both of them will make a nice
sum of many money. With a smile on his face A told S that he did not
want any money because he had all the money he wanted. A commented that
this was the case which makes it evident that they were in position to
help each other: A facilitates the platinum deal for 'S and S get hold
of a girl who can bring out the phone directory for couple of hours.

10. A asked the regular question as to who will be the next
    President of Mexico. 8 told him it will be Luis ECHEVARRIA, but this is
    still not positive. A did not ask for the source of info.

11. S asked A who was the girl in the restaurant he waved to and
    she waved back. S stated it was the girl with whom he quite regularly
    played tennis.

12. S was not able to recall one more thing A asked him to do or

   a drink on Sunday Nov 1 at 1900 hrs. Source and wife were also invited. This get-together lasted 3 - 3½ hours.

2. The party was pleasant and Subject appeared satisfied to be able to have somebody with whom he could speak his language. He was quite talkative, while his wife was rather reserved. Nevertheless, when Source stated that on Nov 3 will be 13 years since he arrived in Mexico and wanted to celebrate the occasion with a dinner at his place and have the same company together, Subject and his wife commented that the celebration would have to be postponed, because Ann de RESTORI and xxxdo: Sokolov will be on a business trip. They both accept the invitation for the dinner to take place a day or 2 after Ann RESTORI and SOKOLOV return to town.

3. It was interesting to note that Subject and his wife Lyudmila stated that ABRHAMID lived in Moscow in the same building or the same complex of buildings and that they were very close friends. Lyudmila went on to say that, ABRHAMIDS daughter was now 18 of age and that she was outright a beauty. ABRHAMID was proud about the fact that his daughter was admitted to the Institute (Source believes: of Technology) In Moscow. Subject and his wife also stated that ABRHAMID was doing fine back home, but no details were mentioned as to what

1.  Subject spoke about the place he was living in here and added that there were several Sov families living in the same building. He started the listing with DULANCY and Source interrupted by stating that he knew DOL and explained how he got to know him. Source went on to say that in connection with the same job he got to know MALAGIN. Subject and wife commented that KALACHNIKOV had left POS same time ago. Source said he did not know it, because he believed that KALAGIN would remain here until he completed a 4-year stay and he did not believe that the 4 years already passed. Subject and wife said they did not know how long he was here but were positive that he left POS.

2.  Subject asked Source whom else did he know in the Sov Emb.
    Source stated that he presently know very few because a number of his friend left. He mentioned he knew CHININISH, whom he liked as a person. There were no comments from Subject and his wife. When Source stated that he also knew WOZNESENSKINO but found it difficult to get closer relationship with him because he is a dry person, Subject started smiling and nodding his head in sign of approval, but Subject's wife remained motionless and looked reproachingly at her husband.

3.  Subject's wife spoke that the fact of having their own car here was of great advantage for her, because the Ambassy has strongly recommended to wives of Sov-officials never to use taxis which obliges them to wait for their husbands or embassy chauffeurs to take them around for chopping or social visits.

4.  Source considers Subject to be a simple man, quite bit a peasant, talkative, fairly attached to the region between which.

Soviet Crirational Contests Contacte

ARIDUSS zase the following corrents concerning what appeared to
her to be operettenci contacts and/or modus operandi of Sovict intel-

Febriefing conductes 23-25 April 1970:

LOGO- During the affair between EIDRIFF and LOGINOV,
they went to the movies once or twice a week, the Futurama and Cine Mod
being the theaters most frequently attended. LOGINOV always made some
sort of contect during these cutings, according to AMIDRIFF. She stated
that he usually left his seat about 2300 hours and went out to the lobby
for some time. She did not know where the contacts were actually made.
Once she and LOGENOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the
Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Army Colonel, who was introduced to her by
LOGINOV as "Col. Sergio." In this instance LOGINOV did not excuse himself
to have a private conversation with the Nexiean. "Col. Sergio" vas de-
scribed by AMIDRIFT as about 40, tall, no coustache or glasses, thick,
curly hair, appeared to be of Spanish descent. The woman with "Col.
Sergio" appearca to be about 25 years old and was introduced as his wife
(which AEMIDRIFF doubted because, as she put it, he didn't treat her es
one would a wife, but rather as a mistress). AEMIDRIFF knew nothing core
about this Mexican and never saw him again.

On another occasion, LOGINOV and AFTERIFY cet an American in
front of the Futurama theater. LOGINO introduced him to her as "Col.
Michael." AEMIERIFF stated that he was dressed in civilian clothes. He

had blond hair, vas of redis height, no classes, larcy grey eyes
(AFMIDRIFF thought him quite attractive). LOGLIOV told "Michael" that he
would call him the next day on urgent business. "Michael" was alone.
AFMIDRIFF stated that they did not have a private conversation. She
estimated this encounter took place about September 1959.

GOLOS-JZCV - AFMIDRIFF stated that GOLCUZCY used her in the
same manner, i.e., took her about 3 times in all to Cine Chapultepec, then
left her during the movie to make some sort of contact.

Debriefing conducted 12-16 May 1970:

Concerning Soviet Contacts in the Mexican Police: AFMIDRIFF
stated that she overheard GOLCUEV and DYCHIN talk about many contacts which
they had in the police here. She said she had also overheard KOLCZAKOV,
PAKULIII, AND CHRYCHOV talk about how many good police contacts the Soviets
have. However, each specific example which AFMIDRIFF could give concerned
some non-operational favor which the Soviets could get taken care of, e.g.,
when the Soviets wanted to get something through Aduana; when some Soviet
was missing and police cooperation was needed; getting advance notice when
some demonstration hostile to the Soviets was about to take place, etc.
She was not able to recall any hints that Soviets had operational contacts
in the police; agents reporting on what the police were doing; assets who
assisted Soviets operationally in some way. However, AFMIDRIFF thought
the Soviets probably have such assets.

Concerning Soviet contacts in West German Police: AFMIDRIFF
recalled that when she went to Germany as interpreter for Soviet surgeon
and textbook writer, Pablo ARNSIN, in January 1959 (they went to Cologne

West Germany on Commerciel Ministry business), the Soviet Ambassador in West Cormany stated that the Embassy had some paid agents within the West Gorman police who helped them to protect the Soviets (in context that it was dangerous there; some Soviet official could be kidnapped by the enemy, etc.) AFILRIFF noted that A'MASOV was quite old and very pro-regime.

Miscellaneous operational notes - ACIDRIFF had no knowledge of Soviet safe houses or safe apartments. She stated that many Soviet visitors stayed at the Hotel Virreyes or in two other hotels near the Soviet Embassy (she.couldn't remember names). She did not know whether the Soviets had any sort of special arrangement or contacts in these hotels.

AEMIDRIFF stated that she had attended several parties at which Mexicans also were present (she recalled specifically parties at the homes of KOLORYAKOV, PARULIN, LOGINOV) and in each instance the Soviet officer, at some point during the evening, had a private conversation with a Mexican guest. (Unfortunately, AEMIDRIFF was unable to recall the names of any of the Mexicans she met on these occasions, and of course there is no way of knowing whether such private conversations were operational meetings.) AEMIDRIFF commented that at purely Soviet parties, husbands all ways went off together and talked business, and if wives approached, they stopped their conversation.

Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970:

KORLUSSEKIN - AMIDRIFF commented that she thought KORUSKIN made operational meetings in the Srecen Par, since she often sas him sitting in that bar, wearing dark glasses and trying to loss inconspicuous.

(ALMIDRIFF sometimes passed by this bar and would look inside, although she never went in.)

KUPLYAKOV - Possible PCI Contact - ALMIDRIFF stated that she was told by Daniel Montiel (Daniel MENEZ Montiel, 201-238951), the Soviet's chauffeur, that his brother, who is a Central Committee member of the PCI and who worked on the PCM publication "La Voz de Mexico," was in contact with KUPLYAKOV. In addition, ALMIDRIFF stated that she believed that Arcando VEREJOO (iden with Armando MARTINEZ Verdugo, 201-851726) had an uncle, also named Armando VERDUGO, who is First Secretary of the PCI and who is in contact with KUPLYAKOV. At least this was strongly inferred by Montiel, according to ALMIDRIFF. (Editor note: Arnoldo MARTINEZ Verdugo, 201-054254, who is brother of Armando, is First Secretary of PCM).

AEMIDRIFF stated that KUPLYAKOV always seemed to be very interested in and knowledgeable of what appeared in "La Voz de Mexico" and in the PCM publication "La Epoca." She stated that, in general, KUPLYAKOV paid so much attention to local politics and seemed to be so well informed on PCI matters that she felt certain he had something to do with the PCM.

AEMIDRIFF stated that KUPLYAKOV's wife was a good friend of Salvador GONZALEZ Marin, head of the Fondo de Cultura Popular. GONZALEZ' wife works in the Museum of Anthropology. GONZALEZ sold a lot of Soviet books, according to ALMIDRIFF, and for that reason was in contact with KUPLYAKOV, but she commented that GONZALEZ may also have been utilized by KUPLYAKOV in some other operational way. Most of KUPLYAKOV's contacts seem to be journalists. (These were the people ALMIDRIFF saw talking to him at receptions, etc.).

AEIDRIFY stated that Leopoldo AREAL, whose wife is the daughter of David Alfaro SIQUIEROS, is another Soviet asset who is handled by KURSYANOV (she heard VAROVSKIY talk about this). AENIERIFF said that ARRUL works with Eduardo ARAUJO (economic consultant for "Minera Conti- nentol; S.A.", mentioned in Commercial Office). She also stated she knew that AREAL went at times to the Embassy to see KUPLYAKOV. AEHIDRIFT said that ARENAL goes to Moscow every year or so.. (ARENAL identical with Leopoldo AREIAL Faster, 201-117959).

Soviet Involverent in Student Msonders of 1658:

Debriefing conducted 25-25 April 1970: EXIDRIFF stated that LOGINCY want cut et nichts often during this period uni told her It was to make "antoate." for also stated that his work during this period was some of the cost dangerous he had ever done. ANNIERIFF was certain that these "contacts" involved in student piots. AEMIERIFF related that once at Auto Cine, LOGONOV made a meeting with a group of youths who cane in another car (Felcon). Another time, some 2 or 3 days later, LOGAW hed MITOPOLSKI give him some shotguns which MITOPOLSKI had charge of. LOGINOV cot the guns about 2200 or 2300; the guns were returned the next morning. Others who seemed to be going out all the time at night during the student riots (end talking about their meetings in general the next morning) were FOLSHAKOV, KORMOUSIKI, KIKIPOROV. AEDDRIFF never heard mention of money being passed during this period (ise., to Soviet assets involved in riots) nor any wention of any names or positions of assets (This not in agreement with some of Dan Jemes info). CHAVKCV seemed to be involved also.

Debriefing conducted 12-16 1970: AMIDRIFF was again questioned on her knowledge of Soviet activities during the 1968 student disorders. She reported that all she really knew was that the Soviets were very busy curing this period; that LOGIKOV told her he was going out every night to make "contects;" that she overheard Soviet case officers talking at various times during this period to effect that they very busy, mrking zany contects; that the situation was potentially explosive and a dangerous time for thea to te making such ecatsets. ALIIKUFF twice was with LEGNICV

when he met with some "youths" in private conversations. However, AEMIDRIFF stated she did not ever hear any mention of any names of Soviet contacts in relation with the student disorders, any mention of the level of involvement of these contacts in the student organizations, any mention of Soviet guidance to the student movement, financing of the student movement, or the like. She really doesn't know that the Soviets had any contacts with direct access to information to these activities, but she strongly assumes that they did, based on their level of activity and the strong tenor that LOGINOV and other case officers gave to the idea that the contacts they were making were dangerous ones for them to be seen with during this period.

Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970: AEMIDRIFF questioned re 1968 student disorders again, for clarification previously reported details. She stated that the Soviets had some different types of rifles in the Commercial Office which served as samples of guns which they were trying to sell commercially in Mexico. One night about 11 o'clock, during the period of student riots, LOGINOV came to the Commercial Office with MITOPOSSKI (AEMIDRIFF was there watching TV). They got "some" rifles - AEMIDRIFF could not see how many or what kind. They took them out in some sort of bags. The next morning "some" rifles were returned to the Commercial Office, but AEMIDRIFF doesn't know whether all of them were brought back. She doesn't know whether or not LOGINOV might have been duty officer for the Embassy for that night.

AEMIDRIFF stated that MECHIPORENKO's trip back to the USSR during the 1968 riots may well have been to report on the riots. However, she didn't know that this was the case and noone specifically told her so.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with Ed ELLY with USIS

DATE : 3 December 1969

1. On 3 December 1959 I had a brief conversation with Ed ELLY to find out if he knew any of the Soviets at the French Club, and to brief him on these individuals. He did not know either CHERNYSH (P-13,042) or SHEVCHINKO (P-15,623) by name and when I showed him pictures, he said that he did not recognize them by sight either. Since he is a relatively good player and they are relatively poor, it is not likely that they would play together. He said, however, that he would keep his eyes open for them and would try to identify some of the contacts they appear to be making at the French Club: I explained to him who the two Soviets were and why we were interested in them, and he said that he would be only to happy to do what he could.

2. I also asked him about Gloria PINTO (P-13,223) and showed him a picture of her, but while he thinks he may have seen her, he does not know her. He will check with his wife who may very well know her since she is a regular player and probably more or less in the same league with Gloria. I told ELLY that Gloria had been very close to LOGINOV (P-11,712) and that I was interested to find out if she would now, since he has departed, transfer her attention to one of the other Soviets. (I was specifically interested in finding out whether or not Gloria and CHERNYSIH had met on the morning of 29 November as indicated by LIENVOY, but ELLY had not been at the French Club that morning.)

3. ELLY commented that he had found it hard to make contacts at sports clubs in Mexico than in other countries. Mexicans were particularly difficult to become friendly with and it was not at all uncommon to have a tennis match with no personal contact whatsoever. He said, however, that he thought the French Club was better than most in Mexico City. Even though the people at the French club were rather clanish, it was easier to get to know them there than, for example, at Chapultepec.

say about anything, why whether it be American or Russian. He is only interested in booze and women. I would say this is a pretty accurate description of TUCHI (who is now gone--replaced by EMFLUTE'S friend PERFILIYEV).

5. Subject has also met LOGINOV, for whom she did not have too much xanax respect. She didn't think him very smart, and he was constantly saying foolish things against the United States. Shaznaxar sakzkia I asked if LOGINOV had ever made a pass at her. She said no; but then she never saw him when his wife was not along. (Again, she has come up with a pretty accurate thumbnail description.)

6. Getting back to SARATOV, they have remained good friends (sincethe Olyppics, and the friendship extends to SARATOV's wife. Subject and Natasha are very friendly, and I would like to keep it this way, for several reasons. I don't think there has been any sex betwen Subject and SARATOX (although I could be rong, and I will ask, and I think get the truth). Subject is well aware of the friction between SARATOV and wife, and has a matter of fact Natasha has said quite openly that she intends to leave SARATON in about a year. They have an 11-year-old to whom she is very attached, and since he must return to the USSR to complete his schooling, she is going to return with him. In effect, she has chosen her son over her husband. Subject does not know whther Natasha's dyerly close attachment to her son (she won't go out in the evening until he is in bed, etc.) is is, theresul the result of SARATOVS palying around, on vice-versa, but it is a fact, and it irritates the hell out of SARATON. On the other hand, Natasha is attractive, intelligent, and if anything more stry f y attached to the Soviet Union than SARATOV Alrasit. Recently she offered to give Supect Rugatan

AEDIEHARD (F-11712) October 7, 1969

Contact Report
Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-13,830)
Date/Place of Meet: Oct 7 at Ches Rene Rest at 1414 hrs.

1. The meet was arranged by phone and 8 came about 14 min late.
   NEXT MEET: Oct 10 (Friday) Insurgentes Sus & Extremadura at 1100 hrs.

2. According to S his last meet with AEDIEHARD was on Aug 25. A had arranged a meet with S for Sept 10, but A did not come to that meet. Two days later,i.e. after he did not come to the scheduled meet A phoned to S' apt in the afternoon when he was not home and after exchange of nice words with Josephine he told her that he was not able to keep his appointment with 8 two days ago and he wanted to apologize for not showing up and that he would ring up 8 in a day or two. Because there were no calls from A for few days (sic), 8 decided to give him a ring and advise him that he had something for him, namely, S had in his possession a duplicated copy of an "Agreement" concerning the Platinum deal. As it is evident from the mentioned copy of the Agreement the same was signed and the Buyers Agent signature, was legalised by the U.S. Consul in Mexico City on Sept 25.

3. Although, this story lacks acuracy in terms I of dates, it is subtantially different from the one s gave to FERNALD on Sept 12, the date of their last personal meet. Inspite of the vagueness concerning the dates and absence of detaile, this story appears to be much closer to truth, than the version of Sept 12.

4. S gave me for copying a technical copy of the above mentioned Agreement concerning the Platinum transaction. As is evident from the wording of the Agreement 8 would have nothing to do with buyer or Buyer's Agent. The Agreement places & on the Sellere side or at the best makes him middle can between the actual Seller and Buyer's Agent. ? did not read the Agreement in the restaurant (during the meat) and made no comments with regard to the Platinum transaction as such.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 336

5. S asked P should he ring up A from the restaurant to ask for a meet with him. F told S that A had left or was about to take off the same afternoon. Instead of commenting on the fact the A left without even indicating to S that he might leave, S stated that this situation was giving him an opportunity to find out for us who was As replacement. F told him that it was a common knowledge as to who was As replacement and that the only thing to ascertain positively was whether A had dropped him (S) or the developments prevented A from meeting with S.

6. Therefore, F suggested to S to phone to the Sov Emb by using the duple talk (code) which A gave him and see what happens. If ahother person tells him that A left Mexico, S should sek how was he to go about a transaction he intiated with A. If the answering person insists in knowing what was it about, which is doubtful, S should limgi himself to the statement that it is a commercial matter involving large amount of money, and it reached the stage that an sction should be taken.

7. S promised to phone to the Sov Emb on Oct 8 about 1000 hrs and F told him that he would give him a ring about 1500 hrs.

88 F told S that he intended to discuss a serious matter with him but did not have all the facts on hand as yet. F added that he would have all the facte the latest Thursday Oct 9 and he asked S to come on Friday Oct 10 to the place mentioned in para 1 above at 1100 hrs and that they would go to an adequate place for such a conversation. S offered that the conv could be held in his apt and P tolf that it would be against our practices.

9. As far as his present activity was concerned, S stated that he was doing a lots of running in connection with his attempt to sell the unfinished hotel on the Caleta Beach in Acapulco.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: LEBACON 1

DATE, TIME, PLACE: 6 Oct. 1100-1200, JET Cafe.

1. Subject arrived at the Cafe five minutes late (unusual for him) fairly bubbling over with "good news". Subject had a little difficulty getting to LOGINOV'S Embassy des edida at 1900 hrs. as he had planned. It seems that the neighbor with whom he had planed to le ve his child was not at home and so he had to wait until his wife came home, at about 2020 hrs. Subj arrived at the Embassy at about 2020 hours where he was warmly greeted by LOG. After only a few words of greeting, Mrs. LOG fixed Subj a drink and a sandwich, and LOG excused himself saying he had to take care of the many guests and telling Subj to make himself at home, "you are more or less one of us." It should be noted that LOG did not introduce anyone to Subj. Subj soon approached Yuri CERNYSH and a rather long, innocuous conversation ensued. Mikhail P. DAVYDOVSKI approached the pair and was introduced to Subj by CHERNISH. (Card attached.) Subj was very taken with DAVIDOVS. It's charm an simplicity and learned that the latter had at one time been a "locksmith," (?) and having studied at the "Inte national Diplomatic Institute" recived this appointment as Private Sect to the ambassador.

2. During one of Subj's free moments he approached Pavel KOVALEV, whom he recognized from the army Day party which attended, but he could not recall his name. KOVALEV said he thought he recognized Subj's face but could not place it. Subj then told him that his mother taught Spanish at the Embassy (actually Subj told me he is not sure she is still doing so.) KOVALEV said he was interested in forming a small group to stud Spanish and have Subj teach it and the latter heartily agreed to do so.

KOVALEV promised to phone Subj at the earliest opportunity. Subj asked KOVALEV how the latter sould be adiressed, i.e., what was his position at the Embassy? K replied that he was more or less attached to the military attache's office.

3. Subject met a young lady, Tanya LTI, and husband name unknown. They have been in Mexico for three months. Very little, if anything else, was said but Subj was impressed with the girl, physically that is. Subj left the party before 2300, got a bear hug from LOG and was escorted to the door by KOVALEV. Subj having only had two drinks while as the party went to Cill's but she was out, so he went elsewhere (no identification) where he sent the night "talking."

Contact Report

Subject: LIGVAL-1 (P-8903)

Date/Place of Meet: Oct 3 at Rest. Koyo at 1330 Hrs.

1. Prearranged meet to which L-1 came 10 min. early.
   Next meet: October 16 at the same place at 1430 hrs.

2. Since our last meet (Sept 19) 1-1 had not seen LIFACOS-l who in two instances apologised (2-3 days after the class was due ) for Lot holding the calx class "because he was not feeling well". In bath cases it was obvious to L-l that he was dead drunk when he på phoned. In view of the fact that LIBACON-l did not phone to L-1 for a whole week, L-1 gave him a ring on Cet 2 and he promised to give a lesson to I-1 at 1630 hrs of Cot 3.

3. L-1 explained me that his working schedule in the new scholar year keeps him busy in the morning and the afternoon, except, Friday afternoons, which makes it difficult on him to be txix tieing himself twice a week for LIPACCIN-13 class which most of the time does not take place. L-l felt that nothing would be lost if he reduced the Russian language classes to one per week, which would be more than he ever actually had in the past. I told him to go ahead and suit himself.

4. I told L-l that AEDIEHARD was scheduled to leeve in about a week and it would be interesting to ascertain whether LIBACON-1 knew it. I-1 will show to LIBACON-1 the Excelsior of Sept 25 in which the Sov End farewell party was announced.L-l felt bed about the fact that he did not even have a chance to see MEDIEHARD face to face.

5. L-1 asked could he remird LIBACCH-1 that he promised to cake some arrangements which would enable L-l to meet Alla (GLEFOVA F-13,482) and suggest that AZDIGHARDS departure was opening the possibility to do something along that line. I told L-l that there was no reason to expect that LIEACON-1 would accomplish anything, but L-l should be after hiz on the basis of his former promise.

6. I told I-l that he should tell LIFACCH-1 that a person he know quite mix well 3-4 years ago returned to the US Embassy and that this Arerican Embassy official was a very clone friend of a dear friend of his (L-l). I explained to L-1 that auch nowe would certainly plense LIRACON-1 for several obvious reasons, but it was more important to as- certain whether LISACON-l would relay such news to some of his Sor acquaintances. If it happens that DICHARDS replacement or another Sov official attempt to contect -1 through LIPACON-1, it would be an indication that LIBACON-1 got the news of L-l's US Embassy contact: L-l liked the idea and will give the story to LIHACON-1.

7. At this point it may be recalled that L-l had met NECHI PORENKO (2-7442 ) at the time he had met YATSKOV..

8. Comment by BH:

In view of the fact that IMECHIPORENKO by himself is a determined KGB case officer who is agressive in pursuing American targets, I felt that we stand to lose nothing by adding to L-l a label of having a contact in the US Embassy...

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

FROM : C/CUB

SUBJECT : Visit to the Soviet Embassy, Night of 1 October 1969; Occasion: Déspedida for Valentin LOGINOV

1. As members of the Cuerpo Consular, Terence D. SISTONE and his wife were formally invited to Valentin LOGINOV's despedida. The scheduled hours on the invitation were from 7:00 to 9:00. Actually, they arrived at about 7:45 and left at about 9:15. SISTONE had two main purposes in attending the reception: 1) to determine LOGINOV's replacement, and 2) to meet the Cubans present, if any. On the first count SISTONE was successful. Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO was formally introduced to the crowd as LOGINOV's replacement by Mr. KAZANTSEV, the Soviet Chargé. On the second count SISTONE was not successful. The only Cuban present that he recognized from mug photos was Rafael MIRABAL Fernandez, who quite obviously avoided any contact with SISTONE, rather furtively staying on the other side of the room at all times. In all, SISTONE talked to some nine Soviet Embassy officials that he could recognize from the mug book and had somewhat extensive conversation with three, LOGINOV; KAZANTSEV, the Chargé; and Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, TASS representative. For cover

purposes SISTONE, of course, also had to spend much of his time with fellow members of the Cuerpo Consular, mostly with Leander VOURVOULIAS, the Cuerpo Consular president and ex-Greek Consul General, and Sra. Marta FONSECA Guardia de JIMENEZ, the Consul from Costa Rica and Cuerpo Consular secretary. SISTONE also met a Mexican engineer, Alfonso SIBAJA C., who is married to a Greek woman who is Press and Cultural Attache for Greece. SIBAJA is therefore active in, though not a member of, the Cuerpo Consular. It is very early to tell, of course, but a man like this could conceivably become an access agent to either Soviet or Cuban officials.

2. At the entranceway SISTONE met and recognized Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV, the Soviet Military Attache. Both on this occasion and later in the evening BOGATYREV seemed to have a forced grin on his face. He exchanged pleasantries but provided nothing of significance.

3. In the reception area inside, SISTONE greeted Valentin LOGINOV and his wife, who readily recalled SISTONE and wife from the excursion to the Ford factory in July. LOGINOV also recalled that SISTONE was Raymond A. FRADYER's replacement and asked after the latter: Had he yet arrived in Paris? SISTONE said that he understood that FRADYER probably had arrived by now. SISTONE asked LOGINOV when he was leaving for the Soviet Union. LOGINOV answered that he was leaving

on 7 October and that en route he was visiting New York City,
a place that he was anxious to visit. He added that he would
not be visiting Paris to see his friend FRADYER. LOGINOV all
evening was a very amiable host, circulating and talking to
practically everyone present. About half the time he was
surrounded by a circle of very young and apparently unattached
Mexican ladies - perhaps university students. Mrs. LOGINOV
was quite transformed from the very drab woman of the Ford.
excursion. She was quite dressed up, even attractive, and
did her best to be a charming hostess, although this was
obviously a forced chore for her. (Later in the evening she
busied herself pointing out what she thought to be the choicest
items on the buffet table.) Valentin LOGINOV invited SİSTONE
and his wife to visit him in Russia. SISTONE answered to the
effect that this would be wonderful someday if he or the
Russian Government would pick up the tab. LOGINOV replied
that that was not necessary because all Americans are so rich
they can afford a trip anywhere. Later, talking to SARATOV
(see paragraph 9 below), SISTONE was told that LOGINOV would
be spending three days in New York City. Later in the evening
LOGINOV had his picture taken, probably by a press photographer,
with SISTONE's wife, and he was in general quite gallant with
her. In the little speech following the buffet, LOGINOV thanked
VOURVOULIAS for his few words of farewell and the Cuerpo.

Consular gift of a silver plate. He ended his speech by saying, "Thanks on my wife's behalf and mine. You all have been very attentive to my great country." About the only times that LOGINOV seemed reflective and serious during the evening wore during this little speech and later in saying good-by to SISTONE (accompanying this with an abrazo).
LOGINOV's last words to SISTONE were said with much real or imagined feeling: "You Americans and we Russians have to be real friends in these days of the world."

4. Negatively, SISTONE did not see LIREALM-1; SAO'S friend, Yuriy VANOVSKY; or Chief, SB's friend, Boris CHMYKHOV, at the Soviet reception. Since there were over 100 people milling about, SISTONE, of course, could have missed those people.

5. Prior to the buffet, SISTONE met again Leon (Spanish version of Lev) N. GOLOUZOV, a member of the Soviet Commercial Staff. SISTONE had met GOLOUZOV on the Ford excursion as well, and the two chatted briefly about that trip. GOLOUZOV gave SISTONE his calling card, which is attached.

6. Standing beside GOLOUZOV, and obviously a very junior officer under the latter's wing, was Vladimir PETROV, also of the Soviet Commercial Office. Following the example of big brother, PETROV also gave SISTONE his calling card, which is attached. PETROV looked to be no more than in his late 20's.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 348

SECRET

-5-

He is almost baby faced, has sort of a pug nose, is perhaps 5' 9" tall, is of medium to slim build, and has light hair. PETROV said he had only been in Mexico two weeks and was terribly confused by the vehicular traffic, which is much noisier and extensive than that of Moscow. Although he speaks Spanish quite well, he said that this is his first tour in Latin America.

7. Also early in the evening SISTONE met Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, Soviet Vice Consul. He is a fairly tall, heavy built, athletic-looking young man with a very strong handgrip on being introduced. KORMUSHKIN was almost the only Russian with whom SISTONE talked who did not even try to be friendly. He just stood around most of the evening, listening and looking very ill at ease.

8. SISTONE only met Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO, LOGINOV's replacement, very briefly and on an occasion when LOGINOV was not around. Therefore, SISTONE was not formally introduced by title or as FRADYER's replacement to NECHIPORENKO. This man looks very Latin and could mix in a crowd on the street without any difficulty. He stayed very much in the background all evening. During the little ceremony in which he was introduced by the Charge as LOGINOV's replacement, he was asked when he had previously served in Mexico by the latter. He replied he had been in Mexico from 1960 (or 1961) to 1965.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 349

-6-

The Chargé described him as a young man advancing rapidly in the Soviet Foreign Service. He also said he had been a simple Military Attache before but is now a Second Secretary and is taking over as Consul. The Chargé described NECHIPORENKO as a non-Great Russian, SISTONE missed his nationality, if it was mentioned. The Chargé hastened to add that NECHIPORENKO's wife, however, is Great Russian.

9. Possibly the longest conversation SISTONE had with any Russian was that with Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, the TASS representative. SISTONE was introduced to him by Findley HOWARD, local Pan American representative. SARATOV was the only one with whom SISTONE spoke in English. All other conversation with Russians and other non-Americans was in Spanish. SARATOV is a very smooth, gallant man-about-town. He seemed to really enjoy talking to Americans and other non-Russians at the reception, and bowed and established rapport with the ladies of all ages. He said he has been in Mexico two years, is married, and has one son in the fourth grade, who is naturally attending the Embassy school and who will be sent next year to the Soviet Union for his further education. He asked SISTONE how many children he has and commented on the answer, five, by saying that in his business it is not practical to have many children. SISTONE asked him how he gets his news to send home. SARATOV replied that he is obliged to send home

daily a resume of the most important Mexican events, much of which he obtains from the Mexican press. He added, with a smile, that he, of course, has to supplement such newspaper accounts with information from his own contacts. SISTONE asked if this meant, among other things, getting handouts from Government offices. SARATOV dismissed such sources as unimportant. He said this daily resume which he sends home by Telex takes him about two or three hours. He said he is the lone TASS representative here. He has his own office separate from the Embassy and prefers it that way. SARATOV claimed to have traveled around Mexico quite a bit. He seemed to be impressed with the Yucatan and wanted to know if SISTONE has visited there. The latter replied that he has not yet visited the Yucatan since being stationed here, but that, as a tourist, he had seen the ruins there some years ago. SARATOV said that he is from Siberia, and in answer to a SISTONE question said he thinks the Georgians are the warmest and friendliest people of the Soviet Union. SARATOV obviously likes to brag about having been stationed previously in Washington. He also said he would very much like to have been assigned to the new TASS office being opened in San Francisco. According to SARATOV, per an agreement between the United States and the U.S.S.R. the former will have a Consulate in Leningrad and the latter a Consulate in San Francisco, The opening of

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 351

the TASS office in San Francisco is somehow connected with the establishment of the Consulate. In speaking of LOGINOV'S three days in New York, SARATOV said he would recommend three things for him to visit: a good steak house, a good Chinese restaurant, and Rockefeller Center Music Hall.

10. Somewhat after the despedida ceremony, SISTONE noted the Chargé, Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV, alone and introduced himself. From a distance KAZANTSEV looks extremely young for his high position; closer up he looks a little older. KAZANTSEV was extremely affable when he learned that SISTONE was a new member of the Cuerpo Consular. He said he is a member of an equivalent organization among the diplomats and in that context knows Mr. Wallace STUART quite well. He said he was extremely privileged a couple of nights previously to be able to shake Astronaut ARMSTRONG's hand and talk to him. He thinks the space program a wonderful adventure for both our countries, and he mentioned the current negotiations between the American Atomic Energy Commission and its Russian equivalent in working out the rules for use of peaceful nuclear energy. While affable, KAZANTSEV does not impart any feeling of sincerity whatsoever. He seems transparently cynical, and reminds one of a second-rate American politician. After the above conversation and when SISTONE was talking to a Mexican airport official, for some reason KAZANTSEV reapproached

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 352

SECRET

-9-

SISTONE and said to him and the Mexican that he hoped there would be a rapprochement soon between the United States and Cuba. SISTONE cannot figure out why KAZANTSEV made that remark at that particular time unless 1) he thought the Mexican airport official was. a Cuban, or 2) he had been briefed by LOGINOV not only on the fact that SISTONE is FRADYER's replacement, but that FRADYER had somehow been connected with Cuban operations.

11. SISTONE only met Yuriy CHERNYSH, Soviet Vice Consul, very briefly to shake hands near the end of the evening. He was easily recognizable from his very light gray hair.

12. SISTONE was only sure of one Cuban's being present, Rafael MIRABAL. At one time; SISTONE thought he saw a gentleman who looked a little like Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas, but at second glance he did not think so. There was no doubt in SISTONE's mind that MIRABAL was avoiding him. On one occasion, MIRABAL was quite close, within earshot, and may well have heard SISTONE either talking English to a fellow American or his wife, or discussing something American. Thereafter, every time SISTONE tried to work his way toward MIRABAL, the latter would shortly move further away. Twice SISTONE talked to people that vaguely looked like they might be Cubans from the mug book, only to discover in both cases that they were Mexican.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 353

13. One of the above Mexicans turned out to be Alfonso SIBAJA C., who described himself as a mechanical engineer and industrial consultant. His address is Ezequiel 82, Mexico 14, D.F., and his telephone number is 17-88-85. This man is the husband of a lady he described as Press and Cultural Attache of the Greek Embassy. SISTONE was also introduced to her somewhat later and got the impression that she is not Greek but either all Mexican or perhaps of partial Greek ancestry. SIBAJA and SISTONE exchanged calling cards (SIBAJA's is attached). SIBAJA said that he and his wife attend such functions as this reception quite frequently and definitely recalled not having met SISTONE before. The latter explained his recent arrival. SIBAJA claimed that he is a good singer of folklore songs and that his wife knows how to dance them. They have performed spontaneously quite often at diplomatic and consular affairs. Asked whether he would be going on the Cuerpo Consular excursion scheduled for late October, SIBAJA said he would like to go. He is a working man, however, and was not sure he could get away. SIBAJA and wife and SISTONE and wife established rapport rather easily, and all agreed they should meet again rather shortly. SIBAJA said that he is of partial French ancestry. He looks as though he might be Mideastern, however. He is proud that he is from JUAREZ' home state of Oaxaca. It would seem to SISTONE that this is

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 354

SECRET

-11-

the kind of man who might be used as a fairly nonsuspicious access agent to either the Soviets or the Cubans. He obviously circulates in their social milieu. SISTONE intends to follow up on this man. He said he lives in Colonia Lindavista, where SISTONE'S wife's relatives are concentrated. He has a son going to Colegio Tepeyac in that area.

14. The only Americans SISTONE was aware of at the reception were 1) Clyde SNIDER, Chief of the Visa Section of the Consulate, 2) Findley HOWARD, of Pan American, and 3) David WIESLEY, American businessman and Honorary Consul of Iceland.

15. Considering the fact that SISTONE was only in the Soviet Embassy a little over one hour and had to spend a good part of his time talking to SNIDER, VOURVOULIAS, and that real pain-in-the-neck, Sra. JIMENEZ, he considers his contact with Soviets about the maximum that could be achieved under the circumstances.

CONTRACT REPORT

SUBJECT: LIBAOC! 1

1 October 1969

DATE, TIME & PLACE: 1 Oct., 1600 - 1730, El Portiro West. & Hotel Emperador.

1. I arrived ten minutes prior to the anointed time, noted Subject's car parked around the corner, entered the restaurant and found Subj without difficulty.

2. Without any preliminaries to speak of, Subj told me that he had interesting news for me. As he hesitated for a moment I asked him if he had been invited to the despedida this evening. He was a bit shocked and probably disappointed, but broke with a "no, what", but recovered quickly and admitted that this was to have been the interesting news - yes he had been invited and was going. He explained that he had made a phone call to the embassy to invite LOGINCY to his house for a farewell party, but the latter turned the tables and invited Subj to the despedida. Subj claimed that he told LOG that this in reality a "dirty deal", but LOG countered with the claim that Moscow wants him to return urgently and now he was too busy to consider personal invitations. (Subj did not appear to be unhappy with this turn of events.) Subj promised to keep his eyes and ears open and fervently hoped that LOG would introduce him to his replacement, the un-official one.

3. Above, of course, took only a few minutes, the rest of the time Subj discussed women, food, drink, and related topics. He would like, he said, to be better acquainted with Alla GLEBOVA (works at Sovemb) whom he considers to be an exceptionally interesting girl, although married. (I don't believe he is in a position to do much about this. I believe he is capable of seducing a lot of girls, but I don't see how he could work up much access to this woman.)

4. Subj gave a copy of a short paper (written in Russian) he worked up on his friend REMAREV who lives in San Juan del Rio, near Queretaro. Subje is very anxious to have us help this individual but I still don't see much point in it. I asked Subj is REMAREV is acquainted with anyone at the embassy and was told that he might know one or two the Kazakhs/Spaniards/Greeks (nines ?) who are employed there. REMAREV is one of these himself. A translation of the document is attached.

5. Subj is a very friendly, likable chap, but I do not him think he could find it difficult to fabricate something, whether it be important or otherwise. This is surely an opinion, so far, based on nothing concrete.

6. Subject expressed a desire to have a "blast" with me sometime with no reference to business. I said I would consider it, perhaps it would be amusing.

"HERPES sho lives in San Juan del do."

"HENARES

A Spaniard born in the province of ASTURIA. During the Spanish Civil War was taken to the USCR with other children. Completed his elementary sencaling in Spanish childrens' schools. Entered Leningrad University majoring in history, ni following graduation was a given a chair in the same deartment. Arrived in exico, I believe, in 1957, with the aid of ais sister, who lives in San Juan del Rio. Is a manager of a restaurant. Henares is a very intelligent, sensitive, fellow. Always studied with pleasre. des very font of nature ad animals. Daring periods of vacation from the elementary schools, instead of just fooling around as did the other kids, he would wora as a shepherd, water boy, in vineyards, took long walls, read, swan, ani always tried o be a loner. Therefore, he was not very well liked, was teased, and once, knowing that he was not a good swimer, was thrown from a steep bank into the river ALIA My mother dragged him out. He always loved her, and to this day has great affection for her. Whenever he visits exico he never fails to call on her. Being acquainted with his character ani sentiments, I would say that now, living in a lead city, he suffers greatly. I suppose that because of his loneliness he impregnated a stupid, old fashioned, infan girl. diş political views are the most liberal, and being an intelligent fellow, he was never placed in an unconfortable position, although he was not fully trusted.

I think, that were it possible to use these characteristics, we could use him to our great advantage."

I toli Subject that we would make no move whatsoever, until, and cermaps not even then, he provided me with personal biographic data re the above individual.

1. Talking to various people, such as Guillermo Tardiff, no information has been circulated or has circulated regarding the fact that Carrillo Flores did not attend the interview of Raul Roa, foreign minister of Cuba and president Diaz Urdaz.
2. By going to the General Assembly of the United Nations, lic. Carrillo Flores, secretary of Foreign Relations is out of the presidential race by constatutional reasons.

According to people who may be considered as knowing about politics Carrillo Flores never had a chance to be nominated because of his closc associations with United States Pankers.

2. On the 18 of September I went to the national day celebration at the Chilean embassy, where I met Kazantsev who invited me to go to their ambassy on the first of October for a farewell party fcr Valentin Longuinov, who is leaving soon. The new checoslova- quian ambassador was with Kazantsev. I arrived late and many people had already left. Wallace Stuart was there, the new Rau ambsaador, the Chana ambassador, the Paraguyan chargé d'affairs, an several other diplomats of minor importance. The Chilean colony seems to be quite large.

1. Subj arrived eight minutes late and realising same, apologized. He appeared to be in a good mood and when asked told me that he and his wife were now getting along very well. He claimed that he called LOGINOV an, at the Embassy on the morning of the 15th and asked that their dinner engagement for that evening be post oned. According to Subject LOO told him that their dinner had been scheduled for the 18th, not the 15th, so Subj mamad assumed LOX was correct. I remainted Subj that to the best of my recollection it had been for the 15th. In any event, Subj said LOO took the costponenent very well, especially when Subj confirmed with LOO again that the latter was not leaving in October, perhaps not even in November. Subj apologized to LOO, explaining that his wife had just taken on a new job, was nervous about it, and in addition, was taking care of her parents dog and birds, and was simply not in condition to have a party. (I am not sure subj went through with this explanation to LOO or to me only.) Subj plans to visit LOO at the Embassy on the 29th, 30th, or the first of October, at which time he will set a date for the dinner, hopefully he said, for the same week. If the dinner is to be held prior to to the evening of the first of Oct. Subj will call the office, (as in the past) and so inform the party on the other end. Our next meeting is scheduled for 1600 hours, 1 Oct., at te "En Mortiro" (?) Rest. anar in the Suite's Emperador.

3. Subj then asked me if I/check a street map of Moscow and see if I could find NEZHDANOVA on it. I told him I could but would not give him an answer ons/or the other unless he would provide me with a satisfactory reason. After extracting a promise from mo that I would not laugh at him, ho roceeded to toll me about a recent experience he had with a medium at Andrea's home. He prefaced his story with an assurance that he is an atmist and does not believe in the hereafter nor in spiritualism in particular, nevertheless, ho was shaken with the experience. Ha cined that the modiwa (name unknown to Subj.) did not go into a tranom, nor turn off any of tin lights, but sim ly ased Subj. if he had ev r known a girl by h nuso of "Tanya while Subj. lived in an amall town near Ivanova (A.so not far fra Hoscow.) sub alaizod that he recalled a girl by that hame, that ho an: she wore only about 10 yrв of aro as to tim, and that tey used to to tamahroca gathering together. the ho said e brove out in a cold avant when Godin 5:01 1:13 quan because he was absolutely positive that no o in extoo wald remser a girl'e na nor na 10010. thon sald, meaking for Tanya, biurovo Hafichka", (itello, mfsel).

Tanya further explained that KIRASOV was engaged in some unspecified underground work, possibly xxit anti-government activity, and that one mrber of this group was actually employed by the KOB. He was not further identified.

4. Subj then went on to relate two other 8 "odd" experiences he had had prior to his coming to Mexico. They are not worth repeating here. I told Subj I would try to locate the afore mentioned street on the Moscow map but that I did not take any of this very seriously. Although Subj realised that I was amused by this tale he was not agad angered by my attitude saying he did not know what to make of it himself.

The party was very gay, excellent food brought by each of the guest, auch music, dancing, and drinking. No politics. Everyone was in a very friendly nood.

2. Formel farcoll reception. Wodnesday, October 1, at 1900 hours at the Soviet embassy will be the fornal party for DIEHARD.

The Pintos, Gomez and possibly others from our group will attend. this party. I do not know how big it will be.

DIEMARD was disappointed when I said I would not attend, but that this was no reflection on ny friendship for hin. I stated that I folt it umrise for an American to visit the Soviet embassy. I was afraid that the FBI or CLA would learn of my visit. Val was very insistent and said he'd be disappointed if we did not cono. Later in the ovening he brought up the subject again and insisted there would be no way anyone could know if I were present or not there would be no risk to me--no nanes would be recorded. I said I would think about it, but doubted that we would come.

3. DISHARD's replacement. During the course of the evening speeches were rado, or at least semi-formal cocaents and wishes of goodluck to DISHARD and his wife. DIEHAND said that his replacement would be at the farewell party at the cabassy and he hoped we wald all act blu. Ralph Wieganit stated that he wanted DICHLO's replacement to know that he, the replacement, would be welcome in our group. Our group is somewhat inter-ntional and has given us all a chance to exchange views. We would remot losing extact with the Soviets. DICHARD then mentioned that his replacement is something of a sporstaan.

4. Ari Schornich. I told DEEHAPD that I hadn't seen Yuri for a long time. I asked wit had happened to him. Ho answered that Yuri had been on vacation for a wile. This does not account for the nary months, perhaps five or six, that I have not seen Yuri. I did not press the issue.

5. DISHARO FLIRT. DESMARD soczed to be indifferent to Pepo's procenes, then ho danced with Gloria he often secaed vory intizato--dancing close, whispers and girls giggles, souliul looks. Gloria did not try to control this situation, but rather participated.

Maxico since has chon hia't to the world as Mexico's groat hand surgeon. Ho travels around the world attending rodical conventions and is the principal host to zodical conventions here in Hoico. An elaborate book was published by Seguro Social on surgery of the hard ari Luis' work in that field. I mention the above since it sees to sot the store for seacons who night beliovo that socialisa and socialized zedicine is good, becauso ho hinself has profited so greatly from it.

Further, Luis and Sylvia had nado it knom for quite some tine that they wanted to have the fare:coll party for DEEHARD in their heze. I always felt that this was dus to communit sympathy. How I don't lamow. And I an at a loss to explain why they insisted upon holding the party. They do not seem to be close friends of DIZHARD, are somewhat different in social and intellectual status, and no longor seca to no to be con- nunist sympathyzers.

Luis commented that I DIEMAND's son would probably coze to the prty since they have no raid. Incidentally, he did not core. Ee then stated that the boy stiil ppoaks no Spanish at all. He added that the boy has lived in Mexico for five years and before that for soveral years in Cuba. Luis explained that the Soviets are afraid to have their children see how the world really is. Luis added thit Kruschev saw a super-market in Los Angeles and simply couldn't believe his eyes. Luis was frankly critical of the Soviets and their intellectual isolation- ism.

7. DIEHARD MIGHT RETUEN, DIEHARD and his wife both con- ceded that there was a good chance they night come right back to Mexico. She told no that if she did, sho would like to teach me Russian. We had exchanged a for elementary words during the evening.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief SB

INFO : Chief, CUBA

SUBJECT : Relationship Between AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO

1. In response to a conversation between Chief, SB, and the under-
   signed, LIREALM-1 was questioned indetail on 25 September concerning
   the relationship which exixts between AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO with a
   view toward possible embarrassment of AEDIEKARD before his superiors.

2. LIREALM-1 and his wife both believe (but have no proof) that
   it is probable that Gloria PINTO is having or has had an affair with
   AEDIEHARD. Both LIREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINTO'S
   and know that Gloria is strongly attracted to AEDIEHARD who is both
   physically and intellectually superior to her husband. Due to Gloria's
   continued friendship with AEDIEHARD at the French Club and other places,
   LIREALM-1 feels sure that Gloria's husband, Pepe, does not yet know of
   the affair.

3. LIREALM-1 characterized Pepe PINTO as: aveet, slow-witted and
   below average in intelligence. He is a physician specializing in lung dis-
   orders, born in the Canary Islands. He considers himself a Spaniard with
   the Characteristic Spanish lack of respect for women. He attempts to
   tigatiy control Gloria's activities while, according to Gloria, having
   as many affairs himself as he can. Gloria greatly resents Pepe's attitude
   toward her. Pepe is basically defensive and would not want anyone to know
   if Gloria were having an affair with another man. He would probably deny
   it if anyone said so, even if he were aware of it. He would take it out on
   Gloria, however, and would probably beat her and restrict her movements even
   more closely.

4. In view of the above, it would certainly appear that there would be
   nothing to gain, and perhaps much to loose, by any attempt at exposing her
   supposed affair with ABDIEHARD. Since she now appears to be in contact with
   SHEVCHENKO, much better to hope for better developments in this case.

is more to this invitation than meets the eye and that the KGB will be going all out to recruit him. I think Subject may be right and I think he should probably find a good excuse for not going.

Subject states that he had complained to KAZANTSEV (P-880) about the shoddy treatment he had been getting from LOGINOV (P-11,712). Never before had he been forced to "stand in line" for Soviet visas for his clients. In the past, he had been able to sent passports to the Soviet Embassy any day--never mind the office hours--and get the passports back with visa the same day. Subject says that LOGINOV himself finally admitted that this was because Subject had been uncooperative (meaning that he had refused to let LOGINOV recruit him). Subject says unequivocally that LOGINOV is leaving PCS by the end of October and that he is not being replaced by a newcomer. Subject understands thatNECHIPORINKO, who in a former tour bad worked in the Consular Section, will take over as Chief of the Consular Section when LOGINOV leaves.

Subject says that KAZANTSEV is about to leave (in fact, Subject thought KAZANTSEV had already loft) and that both a replacement for him and a now ambassador were on the way. I told Subject that as far as I know, KAZANTSEV was to be replaced by another concierge Consejud who would be Chargé, but Subject insisted that an ambassador had beon named and would be coming soon. He did not know who the ambassador would be.

Subject remarked that both IVANOV and NIKITOLOV had left and he said that NIKITOPOV was, he thought, a very decent person.

Subject said that PRIKHODKO (P-2270) had come to sae him to say goodbye. PRIKHODKO had said, almost with tears in his eyes, that Subject had been a very good friend and that he would never forget him. He invited Subject and wife to come visit him in Moscow. Then when Subject asked PRIKHCDKO for his address, PRIKHODKO hemmed and hawed and said that he didn't really have an address yet but that Subject could write him in care of Latin American Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Subject remarked that PRIKHEDXO was undoubtedly being sincero, but when you came right down to it, he was just as hemmed in and afraid as anything of the others. Subject said that it was a real tragedy that the Soviet system made such robots out of good people.

Memorandum

TO: RIZZUTO through ARCHBOLD

From: FERNALD

Subject: AEDIEHARD (P-11,712) Thoughts Ro possibility of Pitching Him

1. Assuming it was agreed that A should be pitached before his POS departure, because there are no indications that he would be more susceptible later to an approach later when he comes to a new post abroad in few years and, to the contrary, it is more likely that he would be still more daring, more selfconfident and more determined to advance and solidify his position within the KGB, I wish to add some views of mine to the list of possibilities as to how a pitch could be carried out.

2. My views and thoughts on this subject will be based on the possible use of existing assets and means. I am fully aware that there will be plenty of room for improvements, additions and modifications of what will be said in the following paras.

3. As far as I know we are lacking adequately solid facts in which we could put our teeth, i.e. we do not possess worthwhile mentioning material which we could use to exert a desired pressure on A.

4. I am inclined to believe that we are in a position to make a serious attempt to obtain a "pressure argument" through the use of existing assets which are targeted against A and that it can be done without taking an undue risk.

5. As a move in this direction I was thinking in terms of having recorded a SABORI-A meet for which we would prepare SABORI. To be more specific I have in mind a situation along the following lines:

a. In going to one of his next meets with A, SABORI should carry on his person a transmitter. I am not in favor of a body recorder, because the recording time is limited and it requires the bearer to be turning it on and off, while the transmitter can be set and it requires no motion by the bearer on one hand and on the other the bearer is under the impression that

> [Figure: handwritten notes]

September 23, 1969


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 371

- 2 -

every action and statement of his is recorded from the moment the transmitter ie strapped on him.

b. SABORI should go to such a meet with experession of a person who is in exceptionally good mood, because of a business success and he was given a substantial advance on his commission: After A and SABORI have their routine two drinks, SABORI will state to A that he would pick up the tab for the evening ( after being treated by A so many times ) but he would want to celebrate the occasion. It would be desirable that A agrees on a drink or two to please S, but even if that does not take place, it is anticipated that A would want to accompany S in his good humors. What ever be the case, the situation lends itself to a free talking, critical commenting and some bitching, juat to play it big. It will be up to us, to prepare S as to how to run the conversation to get out of A a few statements which he would not like his superiors to know about.

c. As far as 5 is concerhed I believe that he can be persuaded to carry a transmitter on his person and as a reason for requesting it we could tell him that It represented a complimetary element to the PAQ which he made on A, because the psychologist who reviewed hia PAQ considendit essential to have a tape covering one meet. There is no way of hiding the fact that we will be recording what is transmitted, but we will not have to give any explanatione regarding how it will be done.

d. I hope that one way or the other we will in possession of a tape which could be used as a pressure factor. From there on all becomes a matter of manupulation: S may request a meet with A under the pretext that that the people interested in the platinum deal cent to f their specialist, who would like to cleer come


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 372

- 3 -

questions before opening the letter of credit and that
it war essential that the person who arrived here see
A, because that will strangthen S' position in the deal.
I mentioned the platinum deal because it would give
some common ground to the new person being introduced
on the scene, but some other story might be as good.

e. The new person showing up under the platinum deal
or any other pretext would be a case officer of ours.
I feel that such a person should at first sight show
that he was a Yankee, that he be versed in platinum
or what ever the pretext may be and that he should be
a Russian language speaker. I am inclined to believe
that after some business talk and after creating an
atmospher of mutual understanding there would be no
problem for the case officer to start speaking Russian.
If A takes this fact in good mood and the business
conversation continues in Russian, S would be in a
position to excuse himself as a person who was no longer
needed. It is almost impossible to anticipate what.
would be Ab reaction to the fact that S wanted to leave.
If insisted that S stay, we will have to accept it.
Nevertheless, S will be instructed to "go to the bathroom'
for a while and the case officer will have to use this
opportunity to drop his cover and go on with his job.
He will have in his pocket a reel of tape to counteract-
Albi emphatic refusal (which we must anticipate ).

f. It may be mentioned that S will not have to know
anything about the existance of the tape and as far
as the case officer is concerned S may have to be
satisfied with the explanation that the c.o. was the
psychologist who decided that he wanted to meet A in
person. Of course, may not bear out this cover, but
that will be at the stage of dezelapuents when we
could not care less.

C. There is no doubt that s will be burned whether the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 373

372

the things turn out right orwrong, but S will be left
only with guesses as to what transpired between the
case officer and A in Russian.

h. It is the fate of any officer making the pitch to be burned if the exgersice ends in anything less than
a success. Therefore, it would be worthwhile considering
to get a suitable laguage speaker case officer from
Eqs for this purpose.

6. I am aware of the fact that has the above discussed scheme has
   a quite certain weakness in as much as it is built on and around an untested
   asset as S is. Nevertheless, in terms of security and protection of Agency/
   Asxata Station assets the scheme is advantageous, which is selfevident.

7. It should be assumed that S might come up with some objections
   when it comes to introducing another person to A from fear that he would
   deal himself out of the game and terminate his usefulness to us. I do
   not consider it difficult to put him at ease.

8. For your consideration and comments.

Agree that blackmail won't work - but in reading file mair thaing that stands out (to me at least) is the energy with which AEDIEHARD pursues his career. Believe he is *ruthlessly* ambitious to get ahead. If we are willing to burn SABORI, it might be advantageous to insert senior Russian speaking staffer as suggested in this paper (but without transmitter) who will make A offer to think over on long cold Moscow nights prior to his arrival at a new post. Our offer will consist of first, sewing seeds of discontent on fact that he is now 42 years old and has not risen to the heights in his professions that he cou'd have. (He is only listed as 3rd Secretary while younger men ere 1st and 2nd Secreteries ) I don't know his KGB rank but it can be intimated that we know his rent could be higher. Telking fast, we could then suggest to A that we will work out a olen in his absence whereby we can aid his future career by pitting kis in his path adventegeous situations such as allowing him to "recruit" a U.S. official at his next post. In return, he world service our requirements d'ring his tour. Our working relationship with A could have a time limit with control factors on both sides. "No answer is wanted now. Report the approach if you wish. The offer will be good upon your arrival at the new post whereever it is." (A, of course, will thing the talk is recorded so there must be some way of assuring him it is not. SABORI, naturally, must be absent.)

1. It is possible that Oleg had been planning to contact me and had deliberately had placed himself in my path.

2. It is also possible that Oleg, like all the other Soviets, hates to spend money and would rather play with another club member than to spend money on an instructor. He may be trying to build up a group of friends or acquaintances with whom he can paxxixxhixxxixxaxplay. (continued next page)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 377

9. Supervisor's comments (continued)

3. If he had been looking for me, it could be that họ has been asked to step in where val failed. That is, as an American friend, I never invited Val to my home. He never met other Americans through ma. Note, however, that he never invited me to his home either--though he did invito us frequently to various events which were under the auspices of the Soviet embassy. We did not but rarely accept, One such occasion was the Moscow circus.

4. If he had been looking for me, it could be that he wants to assure his acceptance by our tennis group where Gloria Finto is a possible target. Oleg has gotten to Gloria, but I, the American who is somewhat and sometimes hostile to soviets, might be considered a stumbling block. Perhaps he, Oleg, will try to reach all the other members of the group in-dividually so that an invitation by Gloria to one of our functions will meet with general acceptance.

SCENARIO OF CONTACT

I arrived about 0900 and took an instructor.

About 0950 Olegk arrived to play with and in-structor on the adjoining court. He made no effort to greet me. He had been pointed out to me by Val, but I had not been pointed out to him do my knowledge--though it is certain that Oleg and jVal must have discussed the "players" in their"game" and counted me as possibly on the other team. That is, I am sure that val has pointed me out to Oleg, but Oleg would not have wanted to acknowledge this.

At 1000 my hour was up and I told my instructor I was through--I did not want to continue for another hour. As I was paying my instructor I noticed that Oleg was paying his. It is very unusual and possibly even had form to take an instructor for less than half-an-hour. I am suggesting that he wanted to bộ free to contrive an accidental meeting with me.

I set a course for one of the several gates from the courts we were using. I could see that Oleg had headed for the same gate (this could have been perfectly natural) and at a speed which after some thirty yards would bring him to the gate at the same moment as I (this was not entirely natural).

Since I had an excuse to greet him, having had him pointed out in front of Pepe Pinto the preceding week, I did so. I asked said Good Morning and asked if kal were here. He looked very pleased (I kthoughe possibly relieved) when I took the initiative and recognized him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 378

Oleg said that val had not arrived es far as he knew. I said I had been training to get ready for Val. I wanted my revenge for last week.

Oleg seemed amused by this and immediately asked if I would like to play with him since Val was not here. I agreed. We found a court and played for about one hour. Olgg won 6-3, 6-4.

Oleg is very athletic in appearance and played and excellent game for someone who has played for only two years (if this is true). He has enormous muscular thighs. It escapes me what sport would produce this, other than weightlifting. Weightlifting is out since his upper torso, though muscular, is far less developed than his legs. Basketball does not seem likely to produce his particular kind of development.

Oleg is pleasant. Speaks excellent Spanish. Has not made any political comments (yet!). Seems more intelligent, but less extroverted than Val.

Oleg asked if I were with the American Embassy. I answered"no, I have my own business". It was then that he asked if I knoew another "Bill" who is in private business ana who is has an army rank. Oleg Khonyhawajaxx thought the other person was a major.

I left at this point. Oleg stayed on to play some nore. My wife could not see him and it is not therefore, known with whom or how much longer Oleg did play. Val was not seen during the course of the morning. The Pintos are in San Francisco.

Contact Report

Subject: Jimmy SABORI (P-13,830)

Date of Meet: Sept 10 at Samborns-Lafragua at 1700 Hrs

1. Prearranged meet and S came 10 min early.

   NEXT MEET: Friday Sept 12 at Chez Rene at 2000 hrs.

2. Instead of receiving the Agency Contract from the Moon Valley Corp. Dallas, Texas, he received a phone call (his phone was connected) on Sept 10 in the morning and was requested to sign the contract immediately and return it by registered mail. The caller (Leater MacGhee) told S that the contract was mailed "Registered-Return Receipt" on Mon Sept88 ". S concluded that he expected receiving it on Sept 11, but more likely on Sept. 12.

3. S was disappointed because he counted on showing the contract to AEDIEHARD that evening and the absence of the contract will necessitate another meet with A when the contract arrives. FERNALD repeated to S that he needed a Xerox copy of the same and decided to meet with S on Sept 12 to debrief him on his meet with A and get a copy of the contract.

4. S will not have much to report to A when he meets him that evening. S went to the Hotel Geneve where a friend of his used to be a manager and was disenchanted when he found out that he no longer worked there. The new manager did not want to show him the register of guests and his attempt to spot a girl or girls who lived in the hotel and appeared to be working bore no results, because all he was able to see or exchange few words were tourists. S spoke to TANG by phone to inform him that the Luau manager wanted to check with the embassy on the size of the add he was to place in the monthly MISSION. TANG stated that he would take care of that and he reminded S that WANG wanted to see the article before it was printed. Other, than to capitalize on the info that Echevarria would be the next President of Mexico and speak about the platinum deal S had practically nothing to report.

5. F repeated the instruction he gave S on Sept 8 with regard to stalling IS activities with A and as far as the platinum deal was concerned it was made clear that his fair and square will determine our attitude.

DATE, TIME & PLACE: 19 Sept. 69, 2000 - 2000, Florence Rest.

1. Arrived by on the dot, found Subject already there. First thing he said was that he could not stay July, was having trouble with his life but due entirely due to his back behavior, apparently he had stayed out all night family, with a girl friend whom he will not identify and did not just push it. I do not feel, at this time, that this is a particularly important item.

Date of Meet: Sept 8 at Ces Rene at 1400 Hrs

1.  The meet was prearranged and S came on time. The meet lasted about 3 hours.
    NEXT MEET: Sept 10 at 1700 hrs at SAMBORNS-La fragua if S does not request to see me earlier.

2.  S was advised by phone from Dallas, Texas, that the Moon Valley Corporation was able to meet the Sov requirements concerning the platinum deal and that they mailed on Sat Sept 6 a contract (agency contract) to S which enables him to purchase 10 ounces of platinum per month from the Sov seller ( an export company ). According to the same phone message the contract provides for a US$3.00 commission per ounce.

3.  S hopes to receive the contract before he meets with AEDIKHARD on Sept 10 at 2000 hrs. On his own intiative S decided that he would want to show the contract to FERNALD before taking it to A. That was the reason for arranging another meet with F before the scheduled meet with A.

4.  The generous commission provided for by the contract enables 8 to offer to A US$1.00 per ounce. Even if the minimum required by Sovs is purchsed a<sup>1</sup>.- commission per os. would still net $20.000.-, according to S'estimates. S anticipates that the purchases would go above the required minimum. 8 was taking in consideration the possibility that A would not want to accept any commission.and Therefore, s came up with a scheme by which there would be a bank account for A and the money would be his, whether he wanted it or nos, or better said , it would be up to his decide when he wanted to use it.

5.  At this point it may be mentioned that spart of the fast whether the love would want to close the platinum deel the entire above mentioned account is strictly & interpretation of what he was told over the phone

and only the copy of the Moon Valley Agency Contrat with & will clarify
many questione one would like to ask right now. Nevertheless, it appears
to be probable that an Agency Contræt was promised to S..

6. In spite of the fact that at the tize of this writing one can
   deal only with "ifs", it is worthwhile mentioning that s believes that
   A would like to facilitate S to get the deal, because in that case S would
   be on one hand morally obliged to him and on the other S would had
   collected a nice sum of money. In turn this would make A feel that he
   obtained a satisfactory control factor over S and the rest is quite ob-
   vious. Other than reccurring to methods which are quite rarely used gainst
   people as 8, we in a situation of a very inconfortable spectator left with
   a hope or a which that A might go for the commission.

7. As far as S'willingness to give to A the attractive chunk of
   money is concerned he is doing it for a double purpose: to please us
   (indirect protection of his interest) and to protect his interest directly
   by assuring As willingness to help him in getting the deal.

8. Although, our situation is not pleasant ( if the deal is to
   materialize) we are not helpless onlookers. S mentioned that if it comes
   to closing of the deal he will have to travel to Zurich, Switzerland, and
   for that he needs a passport. How much S is aware of our control positiion
   ( by enabling him to get a pessport fast or dragging its granting) can be
   best illustrated by the fact that he told F that he would certainly put
   aside a worthwhile sum for F. Needless to mention that I gave him a daάκη
   dern good lecture whaxhxesxtinnad when he made his silly statement.
   Nilly-willy ? was obliged to turn weaknese into stregth and S understood
   that he could as well forget about the deal ( if it comes his way) if
   he would not play it fair and square with us.

9. S brought up quite reasonably the question that A would most likely
   put pressure on him to get producing along the lines of assignments against
   the US Embassy and as the first thing the question of obtaining the
   Kabassy phone directory would be thrown in S' lap.

10. F told & that because of the new development in the platinus
    business ? will allow s to follow An instruction in as to how to go about
    getting the directory. I told him to go ahead and look up all the USIS

girls he can find in the Hotel Geneve and report to A his findings. P point- ed out that we demand from him to stall as much as possible. On S remark that he should have something to report to A when he sees him on Sept. 10 P commented that he will have no objection that & report his findings.

11. S really stalled all he was able in connection with the Chinese Embassy; he did not go there at all, because he still did not obtain the ad from the restaurant Luau.

12. After the above conv 8 completed the PAQ, which is attached hereto.

13. S told F that his home phone was disconnected because he did not have money to pay the bill of MN 632.- This happened at unconvenient time because the Moon Valley from Dallas, Texas, was not able to reach him and they were obliged to contact him through a friend wg of his. F anticipated that S would in one or the other way be asking for money and he had with him a filled receipt for M500.- which he gave him. F implied that he would give him a couple hundred pesos more at his earliest convenience.

14. Then, 8 spoke about the presidential race and stated that the Gobernacion Secretary Echevarria would be the FRI officiel candidate and that the public announcement to that effect would be made on Sept 19. F phoned this info to ARCHBOLD. See Attachment.

SECRET

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 6 September 1969

FROM :CUBA/PBELEMENT

SUBJECT: Recent and Proposed Contact Between LIREALM-1 and AEDIEHARD

1. At the 5 September 1969 meeting between LIREALM-1 and Andrew E. PELLEMENT, the following information was received from and discussed with LAREALM-1:

a. LIREALM-1, following Station advice after the recent incident where AEDIEHARD approached LIREALM-1 with an offer to pay LIREALM-1 for any information he could obtain from the U.S. Embassy, has avoided contact with AEDIEHARD at the French Club. LIREALM-1's wife, an almost daily visitor to the Club, has been asked by LIREALM-1 to note AEDIEHARD's activities and associates and report anything interesting to LIREALM-1.

b. Mrs. LIREALM recently told LIREALM-1 that for a number of consecutive Saturdays, AEDIEHARD had brought a young lady, whom MRS LIREALM thinks to be German, to the Club as his guest. Mrs. LIREALM did not attempt to determine the identity of the female, but reported the information to her husband. She has noted no other items of interest in AEDIEHARD's pattern of activities at the Club. He has not seemed to single out any individual as a tennis partner, nor is he frequently seen socializing with anyone in particular while at the Club.

2. LIREALM-1 was advised that the Station had learned that AEDIEHARD will not return to MHHARSH immediately as originally thought, but he will probably remain in Mexico for another five months. LIREALM-1 was told that this information was not yet public knowledge, but the Station would like LIREALM-1 to confirm this if possible. This led to a general discussion of LIREALM-1's association with AEDIEHARD since the recent incident. LIREALM-1 was instructed that it was not the Station's wish that he avoid contact with AEDIEHARD, but rather that he not single out AEDIEHARD for special attention or closely court his friendship. It is the writer's opinion that a sufficient time has elapsed since the last incident for LIREALM-1 to again renew some association with AEDIEHARD, and a particularly opportune chance to do so is available: LIREALM-1 and AEDIEHARD both belong (as has previously been reported) to a group of tennis enthusiasts at the Club who take turns entertaining each other in their homes. To date, all the members of this group have given parties except LIREALM-1. Mrs. LIREALM, following theincident and thinking that AEDIEHARD was soon to depart, has stated that she did not want to have ADIERARD in her home since he represents a government so opposed to the principles of her govern- ment, etc. Based on ADIERARD's extension in Mexico and the fact that the LIREALM's owe their friends a party, LIREALM was instructed to plan a party for the group and to include AEDIEHARD and his wife in the group invited. At the party, LIREALM-1 should not focus an undue amount of attention on AEDIEHARD, but should take advantage of the opportunity to renew their general friendship and let the matter, more or less, take its own head from there. As a first step in this general direction, LIREALM-l plans to go to the Club over the weekend of 6-7 September at times when EDIEHARD usually playa tennis to at least say hollo.

File: P-11, 712

SECRET

3. A second reason why both LIREAMM-1 and his wife plan to go to the Club is to see if they can identify the new "girl-friend" of AEDIEHARD. LIREALM-1 says he almost always carries his camera with him when he goes to the club and frequently takes pictures of his wife and their friends. Under this pretext, he will try and take a picture of the girl friend if the opportunity presents itself where it will not come to the attention of AEDIEHARD.

4. LIREALM-1 is preparing a written teport in some grester detail concerning AEDIEHARD and his relationship with him since the incident. He will also attempt to see if his can get any more details about the girl friend from his wife.

5. The substance of the above including the idea for the party has been verbally reported to C/SB and he is in accord with the plan for the party, which will be, at least in part, paid for out of Station funds.

Contact Report
Subject: LJOVAL-1 (1-8903)
Date of Meet: Sept 4 at Hoyo 19 Rest at 1340 Hrs.

1. The meet was prearranged.

   Next meet: Sept 11 at the same place at 1330 hrs.

2. During the language class on l'on Sept 1 LIBACON told L-1 that he had a lunch with ANDIEHARD on Aug 29 and on that occasion A accepted to come to JIRACON-ls house for dinner on Sept 15 about 1900-1930 hours. LIRACOI-1 added that Yuriy CHEMYSH (F-13,042) would ask also attend the dinner.

3. LIBACON-1 told L-1 that he wanted to invite, to the same dinner I-1 with wife, Mrs. REX and Odil, but his wife refused to have more guests than the two Sov couples, because they did not have sufficient space and could not afford to spend the amount money the additional number of guests would cost. He went on to state that even this way he was in a quite embarrassing situation because he would not have money to buy more than a bottle of Castillo rum.

4. L-1 thanked LISACO-l for thinking of him and added that he would not have been able to come for dinner that evening because he had to give a class which he was not able to cancel. LIRACOI-1 felt releaved, but he appeared to be very nervous. I-l added, as an afterthought that he would bring to LIBACON-i a bottle of wisky, because his friend Octavio from Katamoros was scheduled to come to town before Sept 15 and he usually brings him a couple of bottles of wiskey; if not sooner I-1 was certain that Octavio would call on him Sept 14 or 15 the latest and in that case L-1 could hand the bottle to IIFACON-1 on the evening of the party at 2100-2130 hrs. LIPACO-1 felt that this would be great and that 1-1 could remain with his guests for a drink.

5. 1-1 commented that the above mentioned developments made it unnecessary for him to go through the gimic of asking to have his classes at LIBACO-15 place. Further, LIFACON-1 told 1-1 that he had asked AIRHARD for the fishing knife I-l had requested, but A did not know whether they had them on stock and if there were any he would bring it


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 393

to the dunner.

5. IJOVAL-1 fet certain that LIDACOI-1 was very nervous during the class and, especially, when he spoke about his meet with ANTICHARD And the forthcoming dimmer. He went to the bathroom & times in an hour and a half (he usally goes twice when served the sere sount of liquor). This lead L-l to sreculate that there might be something fishy in the connection with the dinner, including the roscibility that ANDIEHARD requested to meet L-lat IIDACOI-18 place and that his wife sroiled the plans by limiting the number of people. To keer the matter from developing into wishful thinking I told I-l that it was possible that LIRACON-1, felt imbarrassed for not being able to invite him to the dirrer. L-l cormented that LIBACO-1 had no reason to tell him any- thing about the dinner and if he kept it to himself there would had been no reason for embarrassment. We agreed that there was no reason to speculate, but to wait and sec. I-l stated that his hores went high because LIBACO-1 told hin thet AEDIEHARD tatt stated that his departure was lostroned and that he did not count on leaving before the end of December '69. Difficulty in finding a suitable replacement was given as reason for rostronement of departure.

7. Recuirement: In view of the fact that LIEACON-1 is used to see at L-ls place wisky which doed not have the tax tags (stamps), because he normally gets his from Octavio ( a Customs inspector in Natamoros), L-l requested that I supply him a bottle of wiskey which entered the country tex free. (L-l usually has the Old Far ).

8. For his rersonal use L-1 would like to borrow a John Flaino catalogue, the issue valid after Aug 18,169.

COAT
SUBJECT: LIBACC 1

DATE, TIME & PLACE: 3 Sept. 1969 - 1700, Adirondack - Tontines.

1. Subject was already at the meeting site when I arrived ten minutes after the hour - late because of mother's dominance and traffic tie-up. He had to leave early to pick up his wife and child and take them home and, therefore, asked if we could continue our meeting at a later hour, same day. I had no objection so we agreed to meet at Sanborn's, Tiber & Reforma, and proceed elsewhere from that point.

2. Subject did not prepare any notes for me re his meeting with LOG as I had requested but assured me that he recalled it vividly and then proceeded to describe it to me without any prompting by me.

3. Subject met LOG at the Insurgentes del Refugio, 166 Liverpool, at 1400 hours, 29 Aug, as had been arranged. They stayed in the restaurant for approximately 90 minutes. LOG asked Subj if he had seen any of his American friends lately and Subj replied that he had seen "John" and "Rex" in the usual manner, i.e. as students. LOG offered the opinion that Subj was being "surrounded by Amis and didn't." Subj feel the same way. Subj denied that this was so, at least as far as he was concerned, but if LOG felt that some of these people were "intelligence" types, he, the Subj certainly did not feel that way. LOG then asked Subj how he was fixed financially and the latter said he was as broke as usual. LOG then suggested that Subj could have a little extra money if he would only agree to write a report or two about these Americans. Subj told LOG that he had already reported orally all he knew about John and Rex and that he saw little point in reporting it in writing. LOG then suggested that he would pay 20 pesos for such reports and thus help Subj out of his financial difficulties. When asked by Subj, LOG offered to pay 20 pesos for each report, claiming that "we have unlimited funds for this sort of thing". Subject did deny any commitment, and said that "as a fellow Soviet I would hate to accept any money for such a favor.". LOG insisted that this small amount would help Subj take the vacation he was so eager to take. LOG told Subj that he had bad news, he would not be able to return to Moscow on the first of Oct as he had wished. A replacement for him is not available and he therefore has no idea when he will depart. In fact he had hoped that he could have brought his replacement with him to this meeting, but no luck. In any event Subject invited LOG and his wife to come to his home for a farewell () dinner on 15 Sept at 1930 hours. LOG asked Subj to invite Miguel Angel AERODIO and wife also, and Subj agreed. Subject commented to me that the 15th was a particularly bad date, he having forgotten that this was a big holiday. He will call LOG and see if he still wants to keep the service.

4. Subject told me that AERODIO had confided in him to the effect that LOG had tried to recruit him by writing reports on his friends but AERODIO refused. AERODIC made Subject promise that he would not breath a word of this to anyone.

I told him we were not in favor of his playing a double agent role, at least at this time; however, I would discuss the possibility of his writing a report for ICI with my superiors and let him know about the decision at a later meeting. I also told him to go ahead & write a brief report as though for Lorent to give it to Herndon. He promised to do so but I have doubts really doubt that he will do it. I explained to him that a double agent is permitted to keep moneys received from both sides and that any money he might receive from LOS, for whatever purpose for any reason, would have to be turned over to me. He seemed to understand this reasoning very well.

7. We met at Sanborn's as arranged and I am not very happy about this site for a meeting place. Although nothing untoward happened as far as I know, we will not meet there again. We did not move from there as I had planned to but inasmuch as we were sitting in a rather dark corner I didn't press a move. It is quite apparent, and I suppose with good reason, that Subject is very naive in respect to espionage in general. For example he claimed that he did not the meaning of the term "President". Kuztanski I presume that this term would hardly have any use or meaning inside the USSR. Most of Subject's youth was spent outside of Moscow, in a small mining town about 100 kill northeast of Moscow. Subject claimed that he is becoming more and more interested in working with us, not so much against the Soviet Union but for the dignity and freedom of humanity.

8. I asked Subject if he had read the Penkovskiy Papers. He claimed that he asked for a copy once or twice but "BOM" had not been able to obtain it. He would like to read it in Russian if possible. I think he was shifting at his eyes a bit more but I really don't know where he could get a chance to read it without revealing the fact to his wife or someone else.

9. Next meeting is scheduled for 15 Sept, 2330 hours, Firenze Rest.

Mexico, 2 Nov. 1970

Dear Valya, (LOGINOV)

It doesn't seem to be true, but it is. I am witing a letter ((to you)). Several times I got ready to write, but couldn't because of either laziness or too much work.

One and a half years have gona by since you left. My wife and I remember you often, more so, because there are practically all new and some very serious faces in the Embassy ((now)). I went to the reception on the Red Army Day, but since I didn't have an invitation, they didn't let me in, even though CHERNYSH and NECHIPORENKO tried to help me. As you see, my brother, times change. In our days, 1.e. when you were here, everything was simpler and I would say even gayer.

Well, enough of complaining. I'll now turn to the news. The most important news, at least for me, is that Tege is expecting. We are waiting for the "Parisien package" approximately in February. It would be nice to have a son, since we are not going to produce more children. But if it is a girl, that too would be nice. I will feel as though I am in a harem.

I am studying English and French seriously. In 2-3 years my wife and I want to move to Spain. I have had enough of Mexico. I have been living here for 14 years. On the other hand, with the knowledge of languages, one can earn a better living in Spain. You know yourself that life is much happier in Europe. Last year 21 million tourists visited Spain. One can make a good living through tourism, and without much difficulty.

I continua working in the Institute. We bought a good lot on Rin Street and built a three-story building. Juan luts's wife is also expecting their second child.

Please extend our big hollo to your wife. We remaxber her often. You have boar a very nice and hied vito. Looking forward to your novo, we embrace you.

REDTOP INBREED: Request for Photos and Bio Data

Reference : ESBW-13096, 14 November 1972

1. As requested in Reference, Station queried INBREED as to why they had included Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-0285412) in their list of Soviets who had been PNG'd or expelled from various countries in the past five years.

2. In INBREED's reply to our query, they stated that in the periodic "Das Beste" there was an extract from the Reader's Digest of 1 January 1972, of a bookletitled "Moscow's Attack on Mexico" by John Barron. From this article it was learned that the KGB officer LOGINOV met secretly with Mexican students at the time of the student demonstrations in Mexico in 1968, In March 1971, when five Soviet officials were PNG'd from Mexico, it was believed that Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV was among those ousted.

3. Upon learning that LOGINOV served in the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City as Third Secretary/Vice Counsel from August 1965 to October 1969, INBREED has now advised the Station that LOGINOV'S name erroneously appeared in their list of Soviets who had been PNG'd.

9.03.07 Castrónomo cuyo refinamiento en el comer es pronunciado y extenso. A la mesa es muy ritualista y para él el ambiente y el servicio son casi tan importantes como la comida. Es agraciado y culto a la mesa así como al fumar. Es fácil imaginarlo cambiar de ropa para comer y disfrutar buen vino y finos platos a la luz de candeleros.

Soviet Crerational Contacts:

AEMIPRIFS made the following comments concerning what appeared to her to be operational contacts and/or modus operandi of Soviet intelligence officers in Honico:

Debriefing conducted 25-26 April 1970:

LOGINOV - During the affair between AEMIDRIFF and LOGINOV, they went to the movies once or twice a week, the Futurama and Cine Mod being the theaters most frequently attended. LOGINOV always made some sort of contact during these outings, according to AEMIDRIFF. She stated that he usually left his seat about 2300 hours and went out to the lobby for some time. She did not know where the contacts were actually made.. Once she and LOGINOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Army Colonel, who was introduced to her by LOGINOV as "Col. Sergio." In this instance LOGINOV did not excuse himself to have a private conversation with the Mexican. "Col. Sergio" was described by AEMIDRIFF as about 40, tall, no moustache or glasses, thick, curly hair, appeared to be of Spanish descent. The woman with "Col. Sergio" appeared to be about 25 years old and was introduced as his wife (which AEMIDRIFF doubted because, es she put it, he didn't treat her as one would a wife, but rather as a mistress). AENIDRIFF knew nothing more about this Mexican and never saw him again.

On another occasion, LCGINOV and AEMIDRIFF met an American in front of the Futurama theater. LOGINOV introduced him to her as "Col. Michael." AEMIDRIFY stated that he was dressed in civilian clothes. He

had blend hair, was of rediva height, no glasses, large grey eyes.
(AMIDRIFF thought hin quite attractive). LOCINOV told "Michael" that he
would cell hin the next day ca urgent business. "Michael" was alone.
AEMIDRIFF Omind that they did not have a private conversation. She
esimated this encounter took place about September 1959.

GOLOJZOV - AMIDRIFF stated that GOLCUZOV used her in the
same manner, i.e., tock her shout 3 times in all to Cine Chapultepec, then
left her during the movie to make some sort of contact.

Debriefing conducted 12-16 May 1970:

Concerning Soviet Contacts in the Mexican Folice: AENIDRIFF
stated that she overheard COLCUSOV and DYCMIN talk about many contacts which
they had in the police here. She said she had also overheard KOLCMYAKOV,
BAKULIN, AND CHAYKHOV talk about how many good police contacts the Soviets
have. However, each specific example which AFMIDRIFF could give concerned
some non-operational favor which the Soviets could get taken care of, e.g.,
when the Soviets wanted to get something through Aduana; when some Soviet
vas missing and police cooperation was needed; getting advance notice when
some demonstration hostile to the Soviets was about to take place, etc.
She was not able to recall any hints that Soviets had operational contacts
in the police; agents reporting on what the police were doing; assets who
assisted Soviets operatincally in some way. However, AEMIDRIFF thought
the Soviets probably have such assets.

Concerning Soviet contects in West German Police: AENİDRIFF
recalled that when she went to Cercany as interpreter for Soviet surgeon
and textbook writer, Pablo NASOV, in January 1963 (they went to Cologne

West Germany en Comercial Ministry rasinees), the Soviet Ambassador in West Germany stated that the Embassy hed scre paid agents within the lost Gemman police who lielped them to protect the Sovices (In context that it was dangereus there; some Soviet official could be kidnapped by the enemy, etc.) AUDRIFF noted that AMASOV was quite old and very.pro-repine.

Miscellaneous operational notes - AMIDRIFF had no knowledge of Soviet safe houses or safe apartrents. She stated that many Soviet visitors stayed at the Hotel Virreyes or in two other hotels near the Soviet Embassy (she couldn't remember names). She did not know whether the Soviets had any sort of special artangement or contacts in these hotels.

AEMİDRIFF stated that she had attended several parties at which Mexicans also were present (she recalled specifically parties at the homes of KOLOMYAKOV, EAKULIN, LOGINOV) and in each instance the Soviet officer, atome point during the evening, had a private conversation with a Mexican guest. (Unfortunately, AENIDRIFF was unable to recall the names of any of the Mexicans she met on these occasions, and of course there is no way of knowing whether such private conversations were operational meetings.) AEMIDRIFF commented that at purely Soviet parties, husbands all ways went off together and talked business, and if vives approached, they stopped their conversation.

Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970:

KORMUSHKIN - AEMIDRIFF commented that she thought KORMUSHKIN made operational meetings in the Bremen Fer, since she often say kia sitting in that bar, wearing dark glasses and trying to lor: inconspicuous.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 467

(AEMIRIFF seartimes passed by this bar and would look inside, elthough she never went in.)

KUPINAKOY - Possible PC Contact - ALMIDRIFF stated that she was told by inniel Montiel (Daniel MERDEZ Montiel, 201-230951), the Soviet's chauffeur, that his brother, who is a Central Committee mumber of the PCM and who worked on the PCM publication "La Voz de Mexico," was in contact with KUPLYAKOV. In addition, AEMIDRIFF stated that she believed that Armando VERDUGO (iden with Armando MARTINEZ Verdugo, 201-851726) had an uncle, also named Armando VERDUGO, who is First Secretary of the PCM and who is in contact with. KUPLYAKOV. At least this was strongly inferred by Montiel, according to AEMIDRIFF. (Editor note: Arnoldo MARTINEZ Verdugo, 201-06425h, who is brother of Armando, is First Secretary of PCM).

AEMIDRIFF stated that KUPLYAKOV always seemed to be very interested in and knowledgeable of what appeared in "La Voz de Mexico" and in the FCM publi- cation "La Epoca." She stated that, in general, KUPLVAKOV paid so much attention to local politics and seered to be so well informed on PCM matters that she felt certain he had something to do with the FCM.

AEMIDRIFF stated that KUPLYAKOV's wife was a good friend of Salvador GONZALEZ Marin, head of the Fondo de Cultura Popular. GONZALEZ' wife works in the Museum of Anthropology. GONZALEZ sold a lot of Soviet books, according to AEMIDRIFF, and for that reason was in contact with KUPLYAKOV, but she commented that GONZALEZ may also have been utilized by KUPLYAKOV in some other operational way. Most of KUPLY KCV's contacts seem to te journalists. (These were the people AMIDRIFF saw talking to him at receptions, etc.).

AMIDRIFF stated that Leopoldo ARENAL, whose wife is the daughter of David Alfaro SIQUEIROS, is another Soviet asset who is handled by KUPLYAKOV (the Beard VAROVSKIY talk about this). AMIDRIFF said that ARENAL works with Eduardo ARAUJO (economic consultant for Minera Continental, S.A.", mentioned in Commercial Office). She also stated she knew that ARENAL went at times to the Embassy to see KURDYAKOV. AMIDRIFF said that ARENAL goes to Moscow every year or so. (ARENAL identical with Leopoldo ARENAL Faster, 201-117999).

Soviet Involvered in Student Disorders of 1969:

Tetelofing conducted 25-26 April 1970: AEMADMFS stated that LOGINOV went out at nights often during this period and told her it was to make "contacts."  [Illegible text] stated that his work during this period was some of the most dangerous he had ever done. ADMICHIFF was certain that these "contacts" involved in student riots. AMIDRIFF related that once at Auto Cine, LOGINOV made a meeting with a group of youths who came in another car (Falcon). Another time, some 2 or 3 days later, LOGINOV had MITOPOLSKI give him some shotguns which MITOPOLSKI had charge of. LOGINOV got the guns about 2200 or 2300; the guns were returned the next morning. Others who seemed to be going out all the time at night during the student riots (and talking about their meetings in general the next morning) were FOLSHAKOV, KORMOUSEKIN, HIKIPOROV. AEMIDRIFT never heard mention of money being passed during this period (i.e., to Soviet assets involved in riots) nor any mention of any names or positions of assets (This not in agreement with some of Dan James info). CHHYKOV seemed to be involved also.

Debriefing conducted 12-16 May 1970: AEMIDRIFF was again questioned on her knowledge of Soviet activities during the 1968 student disorders. She reported that all she really knew was that the Soviets were very busy during this period; that LOGINOV told her he was going out every night to make "contacts;" that she overheard Coviet case officers talking at various times during this period to effect that they very busy, making many contacts; that the situation was potentially explosive and a dangerous time for them to be making such contacts. AEIDRIFF twice was with LOGINOV

when he met with some "youths" in private conversations. However, AEMIDRIFF stated she did not ever hear any mention of any names of Soviet contacts in relation with the student disorders, any mention of the level of involvement of those contacts in the student organizations, any mention of Soviet guidance to the student movement, financing of the student movement, or the like. She really doesn't know that the Soviets had any contacts with direct access to information to these activities, but she strongly assumes that they did, based on their level of activity and the strong tenor that LOGINOV and other case officers gave to the idea that the contacts they were making were dangerous ones for them to be seen with during this period.

Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970: AEMIDRIFF questioned re 1968 student disorders again, for clarification previously reported details. She stated that the Soviets had some different types of rifles in the Commercial Office which served as samples of guns which they were trying to sell commercially in Mexico. One night about 11 o'clock, during the period of student riots, LOGINOV came to the Commercial Office with MITOPOLSKI (AEMIDRIFF was there watching TV). They got "some" rifles - AEMIDRIFF could not see how many or what kind. They took them out in some sort of bags. The next morning "some" rifles were returned to the Commercial Office, but AEMIDRIFF doesn't know whether all of them were brought back. She doesn't know whether or not LOGINOV might have been duty officer for the Embassy for that night.

AEMIDRIFF stated that MECHIPORENKO's trip back to the USSR during the 1968 riots may well have been to report on the riots. However, she didn't know that this was the case and noone specifically told her so.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Operation Road Course

REFERENCES: A. Our memorandum dated 9 December 1930, same subject.

B. Memorandum No. 5-69/4748, dated 10 December 1969, same subject.

1. The following comments from CAS/HEX on References are forwarded for your information. In an effort to identify "George", CAS/HEX obtained the following information from reliable sources concerning the 3 and 4 October 1969 meeting between Subject and the Soviets.

2. CAS/HEX sources reported the presence of certain Soviets at the Soviet Embassy on the morning of 4 October 1930, which is when the debriefing of Subject took place. Although the presence of some of these Soviets have been reported previously in Reference A, the context of the observations could indicate that possibly one or more of these individuals was involved in the interview of Subject on 4 October 1939.

3. Yevgeniy Ivanovich FEDIN was seen entering the Embassy on 4 October at 0953 hours. He was seen working in Window #12, which is his and Yuriy Viktorovich KUPYASOV's office. This office is also used for receiving VIP visitors. FEDIN was seen exiting the Embassy with Mikhail DAVIDOVSKIY and Lev GOLOUZOV at 1240 in an automobile carrying license plates "83 DD".

4. Boris Pavlovich KOLONYAKOV was seen entering the Embassy on 4 October 1989 at 0910 hours. At 0019 hours, KOLONYAKOV was observed speaking with Vladislav Sergeyevich KONTUSIKIN in the garden of the Embassy, then KOLONYAKOV entered the main Embassy building by the main entrance. At 1037 hours, KOLONYAKOV was again observed in the garden speaking with Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, after which both went

into the receiving room just inside the gate into the Embassy grounds. If a Mr. X, or MIKEEV is the Soviet who was interviewing Subject as described in his cobriefing report, then this convervation in the garden might have occurred during one of the times "Soviet Car" (as described by Subject) left the room. KOLONYAROV was seen exiting the Embassy at 1904 hours that day in an automobile carrying license plates "89 DA."

5. Veldislav Sergeyevich KORMUSKIN was seen entering the Embassy at 0910 hours on 4 October in the company of KORMUSAKINA, dirving an automobile with license "76 DD." Other than the conversation mentioned in paragraph 4 above, he was not seen again until 1824 hours when he exited the Embassy alone. It is not known whon KORMUSIKJNA left the Embassy.

6. Oleg Sergeyevich KORONEY was seen entering the Embassy on 4 October 1969 at 0840 hours driving a dual-control car from a local driving school. The car and instructor then departed. KOROLEV entered the main Embassy building and vas not seen again until 1349 hours, when ho exited the Embassy on foot.

7. Valentin Sergeyevich LOGIKOV was soon entering the Embassy at 0823 hours the morning of 4 October 1969. Ho vas seen exiting the Embassy in his car, license plates "31 DG," at 0913 hours and vas seen entering the Embassy again at 0939 hours in the same vehicle. At 1016 hours he vas soon exiting again in car "31 DG" with LOGIKOVA. The above is brought to your attention because all of these Soviets are known KGB officers (except FEDIN, who is carried as Suspect KGB), and all have at least passable English speaking ability.

8. Attached is a photograph of Conrikh Ivanovich KUZMIETSOV, who might have been the driver for car "23 DD," in which Subject was smuggled out of the Soviet Embassy on 4 October 1969. Since his wifo, Yelizaveta Ivanovna KUANLIDOVA, may have been with him, her photograph is attached. Also attached is a photograph of Yevgeniy Grigoryevna KOKOVA, wife of Inva Fedorvich MOKHLOV, who night be identical with the woman who met Subject at the gatehouse as he entered the Embassy on 4 October.

9. With reference to the emergency instructions for Subject on the last page of Reference B, CAS/HEX reports that they were not briefed concerning this emergency means of co

He was in "exico on two different occasions.

She states that during the time she was having an affair with Valentin LOCINOV, who was chief of the consular section, he occasionally took her out at night to places where she knows he rape contact with persons who seered to be Mexicans. She says that she doesn't know with which persons he made contact, nor if they were "exicans or not, because she never saw then, but that he, on several eccasions took her to these places: the Cine "od on Lomas de Tecamachalco, the Cine Futurama in Colonia Lindavista, the drive-in theater called Autocinema del Valle, the drive-in called Autocirera Satelite and the fine Tlaltelolco. When she accompanied him to those places, he left the car and she remained in it; that he would go for 10, 15 or 20 minutes to converse with those people. lle never told her who these persons were nor what they talked about.

Assessment of ARDIKHARD

REFERENCES: A. HAMA 37833, 12 September 1969

B. TGA 37626, 10 October 1969

1. The two Personality Assessment Questionnaires on ARDIKHARD which were transmitted as separate cover attachments to Reference A were unfortunately not received until 30 September, by which date we knew from a visa cable sent the State Department by the Embassy in Mexico City that AEDIEHARD was departing PCS one week thereafter, on 7 October. Reference B confirmed that departure.

2. Since but one week was available for the completion of the MKCRUSH assessment, and its transmittal to the Station, we decided not to go ahead with it. The PAQ's have been made a part of AKDIKHARD's file, and should he appear in the future outside the USSR, an assessment can be made at that time.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES: *Reference: DIRECTOR 27630, 7 August 1969

1. LIFIRE reported the PCS arrival in Mexico City of the MAZURIN family on 20 October 1969 aboard Air France flight 707 from New York City. Subject travelled on Soviet Diplomatic Passport D-027105 and his wife, Lidija Petrovna, and son, Andrey, travelled on Soviet Diplomatic Passport D-027106.

2. Per Reference cable, Subject was scheduled to replace Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412). Subject will be replacing LOGINOV in slot but apparently not in position. Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO (201-305870) was introduced at LOGINOV'S farewell reception at the Soviet Embassy as LOGINOV's successor as "Head of the Consular Section." Since we do not have passport coverage on Air France flights, we were unable to obtain Subject's passport, which would indicate his title.

3. Subject was escorted into the Soviet Embassy on his first day in Mexico by NECHIFORENKO.

4. Photographs and further information on Subject will be forwarded when received.

5. A 201 number for Subject is requested.

1. Forwarded herewith is Bruce H. FERNALD's progress report on LIBACON-1, covering the period 30 January to 15 August 1969.

2. AS FERNALD's report indicates, steady pregress has been made in developing LIBACON-1 into a responsive agent. LIBACON-1's credentials vis-a-vis the Soviets are excellent, ard he is learning to use these credentials to the Station's benefit. He was reluctant at first, possibly because he did not want to do the same thing for RVROCK that he refused to do for AEKICK. Patient handling by FERNALD seems to have overcome this reluctance, and LIBACON-1 now responds well to direction.

3. 80 far, there seems to be no reason to suspect the sincerity of LIBACON-l's relationship with RVPOCK. He developed strong personal affection and prefessioäal respect for both KARTASUK and FERNALD, and his turnover to Douglas F. DITMANSON on 14 August 1969 represents an effort to strengthen the emotional attachment, which seems to be so important to him, by providing him with a case officer who speaks his native tongue. And, although LIBACON-1'0 private life is a mess, we willwatch closely to see that this does not cause any greater problem than occasional missed meetings and delays in completing assignments.

4. In the next phase of LIBACON-l's activity, we expect to concentrate on two things:

a. Strengthening the ties with AFDIKHARD (there have been indications that ANDIKHARD's tour may not be ending shortly after all, in which case he will remain a prize Station target).

b. Spotting additional agent prospects, as suggested by Reference A.

PROGRESS REPORT

Subject : LIBACON-1

Period Covered: January 30 to August 14, 1969

1. LIBACON-1 was recruited by Samuel J. KARTASUK on January 30 and was handled by him until March 26. During this period they held nine ops meetings.

2. Bruce H. FERNALD took over LIBACON-1 on March 26 and handled him to August 14, when he turned i over to Fouglas F. DITMANSON. During this period 16 ops meetings were held.

3. After a fine recruitment jol KARTASUK also accomplisied tre difficult task of craverting LIBACON-1's agreement to were for KARTASUK personally into a regular working arrangement.

4. Of the nine meetings KARTASUK held with LIBACON-1, actually only six were working meetings. Info was obtained on LIBACON-1's personal background as well as his ops potential. LIBACON-1 was SGSVIRLED with satisfactory results. Further, LIBACON-1 was motivated to work for us and he was mentally prepared to accept another handler. During this period the condition which LIBACON-1 had placed on his agreement to work for us was respected (i.e., that he would not be asked to report on his personal friends bich as Saniards, his students, or Mexicans to whom he vis emotionally sttached). LIBACON-I did complete for KARTASUK a 15-line written report on AED IEHARD.

5. FERNALD encountered no problems in getting along with ar.d handling LIBACON-1, whom he got accustomed to following instructions and to submitting reports in writing.

6. LIBACON-l's initial attitude was that he had agreed to work, or more accurately, to assist us in our work against AEKICK, but he was determined to keep himself away from everybody and everything associated with AEKICK. Pe did not see AEDIEHARD for more than four wonths, and when they met accidentally in a resort, LIBACON-1 vas decisively turning down everything AEDIEHARD asked for. He went so far as to accept a lunchecs appointment with AFDIEHARD, and then a day before it was to take place he postponed it indefinitely.

7. FERNALD succeeded in convincing LIBACON-1 that he should maintain social or friendly personal contact with AFDIEHARD and his colleagues and that he could do it without either giving in to his or their demands, or at the other extreme, without saying no to everything they wention or ask for. LIBACON-1 followed instructions and went to AFDIEHARD's office to ask him why he had not called him for ten wecks. The result was that LIBACON-1 had two luncheon meetings with ALDIEHARD in July, and on August 8 LIBACON-1 and his wife were dinner guests of AEDIEHARD and his wife at their apartment. The AED IEHARDs agreed to come to LIBACON-1's place for a farewell dinner in September and in the meanwhile LIBACON-1 and AEDIEHARD will meet, for a luncheon on August 29.

8. FERNALD insisted from the beginning of his handling of LIBACON-1 that the latter prepare bio sketches on the MHHARSHers ho knew personally and on Spandards who had lived in the USSR. LIBACON-1 prepared bio sketches, which are actually personality assessments, on AEDIEHARD, IDENTITY A, IDENTITY B, IDENTITY C, and IDENTITY D. The latter two reports showed that he would also report on two Spaniards who are close friends of his, ia spite of his earlier conditions. Further, FERNALD instructed LIBACON-1 to contact > good friend of his (IDENTITY E) when the lartes returned from a longer trip to Czechoslovakia. LIBACON-1 carried out the assignment well and reported (orally) about IDENTITY S's observations, impressions and conclusions concerning what he saw and heard during his stey in his country. IDENTITY E is also a good personal friend of LIRACON..

S. From the above it can be seen that LIBACON-1 has developon inte a person who has confidence in us, and he accepts without reservation that we know what we are doing.

10. In analyzing LIBACON-l's written reports it can easily be seen that LIBACON-1 takes his assignments seriously and when he makes a statement about a person he is scrupulous about drawing only that conclusion which can be corroborated with facts. LIBACON-1 1 equally serious and reliable when he reports about his meeting JtS AEDIELAND: He first reports the course of the meeting and reports AELICIARD'S statements. verbatim, as much as possible. Then, he uses - crea knowledge and the knowledge of the person to relay the actual meaning of the statements. FERNALD not only believes that LIBACON-1's reporting is reliable, but he also feels that ore can depend on. LIBACON-1 to use his knowledge of the area and people to separe the appearance and verbiage from the facts, be they good ord.

11. An assessment of the moral and political reliability of LIBACON-1, from the point of view of his work and activity on our behalf. can only be favorable. The same cannot be said when ore views his peroceal life. In this field he has many problems, which, generally roaring, are a result of the fact that while he is intellectually mature (or at least adequately mature for his age),

- 3 -

when it comes to emotions he acts like a toon-ager. LIBACON-1 is aware of this fact and he ascribes it to the fact that he grew under conditions of regimentation and moral terror; and when he found himself in a world in which people live free and there are no restrictions on personal activities, as long as they do not violate the laws of the country, he remained possessed by the desire to enjoy this freedom. Fortunately, his personal immaturity affects his work for us only to the extent that he occasionally may not complete an assessment; but when he does do a job he does it very well.

12. To conclude: Although LIBACON-1 has his problems, there are restricted to the area which does not affect his reliability, dependability and loyalty to us and our cause. It is felt that LIBACON-1 will be still more productive and easier developed when handled by a case officer speaking Russian;i.e., the language of his formative years.

(13) On 12 December 1968 two team members spotted Valentin S. LOGINOV (known KGB) walking with an unknown Mexican male. After LOGINOV departed the Mexican remained at a restaurant for an hour appearing to be waiting for someone. The Mexican finally departed after making a phone call and was lost in heavy traffic. The team members obtained the Mexican's license plate number from which he was identified as Ignacio VALLINA Barros.

Chief of Station, Mexico City

Contact Between 201-825021 and ADILHARD.

References:
A. HUMA-33764, 28 December 1957

B. HUMW-10709, 11 October 1968

Per LIENVOY Subject of References (Subject) contacted ALDITEARD at 10:15 on 6 February 1959. Subject said that she was in Acapulco. She invited ALDIRILARD for lunch but

in Mexico for a few days before returning to the USA and had just spent two weeks he could not make it. Ho agreed to visit her at the home of her host (reported in reference A) as on as 19:00 the same day. Thus Subject had not contacted the Station, she was called at the home of her host the next morning, 7 February, and a meeting was set for 15:00. Roth on the phone and at the meeting, Subject had a severe hangover.

3. Subject gave full information on her call to AUDILHARD on 6 February. She said that she was just about to call the case officer on 7 February when he called her. She did not call on 6 February because she wanted to wait until after she saw AEDIALDIARD so that she would have something to report. She stated that she had not visited Mexico since the trip reported in Reference A when she first met ALDICHARD because she is tied down with the care of her mother who is still alive. She had sent two or three letters to ADRIARD but he had never answered them and on 6 February AEDIARD Gui said that he had not received them.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

SECRET

1.  As previously, Subject's reporting was terribly confused. From every point let her into rambling tangents. She said that ALDIRAND arrived at her host's home at ca 19:30 on 6 February. About four women and Subject were there. They were all guests at the luncheon to which ALDIEHARD had been invited. The male guests had long since departed to their jobs. ALDIRAND made his usual impression on all the girls, none of whom he had not met before. "They all loved him." ALDIEHARD stayed until ca 22:00 when he left pleading a previous appointment.

2.  ALDIRAND debriefed her on her activities since they last met and told her that he would be coming to New York on vacation. She invited him to visit her and gave him her address and telephone number (under separate cover). She asked about the manuscript of her book which she had left with him. He told her that it was in good hands and that he was looking for a publisher. She told him that she was leaving on the morning of 9 February and he promised to see her again before she left. Actually, ALDIEHARD spent considerably more time charming the other ladies than he spent talking to Subject.

3.  At ca 10:30 on 7 February, Subject called ALDIEHARD in the case officer's presence. He was not in. She was told to call later which according to LIMOVY she did but he was still not in.

4.  The case officer called her again on the evening of 8 February but since ALDIEHARD had not contacted her, she was not met. She was instructed to call the Station before contacting APOLAND on her next visit. She departed on the morning of 9 February.

5.  Since ANDIEHARD did not engage in significant conversation with her and made no attempt to see her a second time, it would seem that he has no interest in her. This is not surprising since ALDIEHARD could hardly escape the same assessment of her that the case officer has. She made an even worse impression than at the first interview--a totally self-centered person who could not even remember the last names of the women who met ANDIEHARD although she can talk endlessly about them on how they relate to her. Her mind is totally distracted.

6.  In view of the above, the Station believes that Subject would be of no use against ALDIEHARD and plans to terminate her, if she reappears in Mexico.

A GERMAN GUEST AND ARSED , "DO YOU THINK THAT LIREALM COULD
EARN AS MUCH MONEY AS HE DOES, DOING WHAT HE SRAS HE DOES,
WITHOUT HELP FROM WOFIRM?" THE GERMAN, GOING ALONG WITH THE
JOKE SAID, "OF COUSE NOT".

C. SUBJECT PRESENTED THE WHOLE THING AS A JOKE BUT WITH A

D. THIS PROVOCATION OF HIS CONTACTS IS *STANDARD* PRACTICE WITH SUBJECT. HE SEEMS TO HAVE A COMPULSION TO COME UP WITH SLIGHTLY OFFENSIVE PROVOCATIONS. TWO WEEKS AGO AT A SIMILAR LUNCH AT ANOTHER GERMAN,S HOUSE, HIS PROVOCATIONS HOW GERMANS ON NIXON'S VISIT TO BERLIN AND ELCTION OF PRESIDENT THERE LED TO HIM INSULTING HOSTS AND LEAVING IN A HUFF SHORTLY BEFORE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVICTED.

E. LIREALM FEELS THAT THIS HARPING ON LIREALM'S WORK FOR WOFIRM IS SUBJECT'S STANDARD PROVOCATION FOR HIM (LIRELM AND WIFE ARE ONLY AMERICANS IN GROUP) AND THAT SUBJECT HAS NO HARD INFO ABOUT HIS WOFIRM CONNECTIONS. HOWEVER, LIREALM ALSO FEELS THAT IF SUBJECT IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THIS PROVOCATIVE LINE WITHOUT EFFECTIVE REBUTTAL, LIREALM CAN BE MADE TO LOOK TO FOOL IN THE GROUPS EYES. IN LIREALM'S ESTIMATE NONE OF GROUP SUSPECTS HIS STATUS IN MEXICO BUT THINK THAT THE WOFIRM LINE IS JUST SUBJECT'S WAY OF PROVOKING THE ONLY GRINGO IN THE GROUP.

2. LIREALM STATED THAT SUBJECT IS VERY GOOD IN DISHING IT OUT TO EVERYBODY BUT INVARIABLY COMES OUT A POOR SECOND IN REPARTEE AFTER DELIVERING INITIAL DIG. HE CAN NOT TAKE IT, IS THIN SKINNED , AND EMBARRASSES EASILY.

1. 201-285412 HAS BEEN ASSIGNED AEDIEHARD.

2. THERE APPEAR TO BE TWO KEY OBJECTIVES WHICH SHOULD BE SOUGHT IN THIS LATEST LIREALM/AEDIEHARD DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE:

A. PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN LIREALM'S COVER IN A NATURAL MANNER, AND

B. OPERATIONALLY EXPLOIT AEDIEHARD'S AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE IN POSITIVE TERMS SO THAT STATION CAN DEVELOP ADDITIONAL

ACCESS TO HIM WHILE MAINTAINING THAT WHICH IS ALREADY EXISTENT

3. IF OUR ACTIONS ARE CAREFULLY PLANNED, THESE OBJECTIVES NEED NOT CONFLICT. REVIEW OF AEDIEHARD'S FILE REVEALS FOLLOWING

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS:

A. DESPITE HIS AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE AND VISIBILITY, THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY SIGNIFICANT SUSCEPTIBILITIES. 201-285412

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Jeremy K. BENADUM, Payment of Annuity

REF: DIRECTOR 104776

1. At the time of transmittal of Reference, I had been informed that the military service still had not been verified. In talking about this matter with Mr. Sidel. I asked if he would request MMPD, possibly through some sergeant to sergeant or colonel to colonel whether the matter could be expedited. He assured me he would give this an all-out try and agreed to let me know during the forthcoming week.

2. In checking this morning I find that Mr. Sidel is out on leave and going into training for at least the next week. In asking how to get in touch with Mr. Sidel, eventually Mrs. came on the line. She advised that nothing new was in the record and there was no info on the verification of the military service and wished to assure me that just because someone want on leave or was out that a case was not dropped. I asked then if any affort has been made to contact MMPD. She said the file didn't reflect anything and agreed to check MMPD and let me know.

Since Subject's annuity will begin on the first day of the month following retirement, it is considered advantageous to make his retirement effective as of the last day of the month. In this way his annuity would commence the day following his last day as an employee.

2. When BENADUM retires, his regular Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (without accidental death and dismemberment benefits) will be continued at the same amount without further cost. The cost of the optional FEGLI, which he is eligible to continue, will be deducted from his annuity until he reaches age 65. These insurances will retain face value until BENADUM reaches age 65 at which time they will reduce at the rate of 2 per cent per month until they reach 25 per cent of their face value. if he wishes, Subject may elect at the time of retirement to convert to an individual life insurance policy in order to retain lifetime coverage in an amount equal to his present insurance. He must pay the premium applica- ble to the type of policy selected. A medical examination will not be required under the conversion privilege.

Jeremy K. BENADUM - Retirement

Reference: IDMS-6919

1. After careful review at the Station and discussions with Jeremy K. BENADUM, we have concluded that the most amicable and efficient separation date for BENADUM would be 31 December 1970. In our review of costs, we find the additional benefits to BENADUM result primarily from his additional two months of service increasing his retirement benefits.

2. Based on this decision we plan on having him begin leave on 14 August 1970 and are therefore submitting the following papers as requested in reference.

a) Attached is the signed original copy of an amendment contract which provides for his participation in the Organization Retirement Program.

b) A memo prepared by BEJADUM requesting approval for him to retire 31 December 1970, and which is concurred in by the Chief of Station.

c) A statement in lieu of a copy of his discharge papers. As outlined in this statement, BENADUM indicates he never received an official discharge.

d) A report of cover earnings for the period 1 May 1969 through 30 June 1970. BENADUM's statement indicates he has received no income, either in dividends or salary, from his cover company since 30 April 1969.

3. BENADUM has indicated his present plans call for him residing in the U.S. for a period of six months each year. He plans to return to the States after 31 December 1970 and has queried the Station regarding reimbursement for return travel to the U.S. for himself and family. In future correspondence please indicate whether return travel is authorized.

None.

On comparison to official Station cover, and for the type of work that Subject has been engaged in, the cover is good. His cover is that of a retired former FBI employee ("rentista" in Mexico). He is an investor in a Mexican business firm and has properties in the United States which he manages from Mexico. Subject is also independently wealthy. Subject is known to be a CIA asset in high Mexican Government circles.

The Station has consistently rated Subject's performance as "strong".

Subject and his family have adapted completely to a dual life. Subject works full-time for CIA and there is no conflict of interest with regard to his work for us. (Subject has been employed in this same position for approximately ten years.) Subject's wife has a full schedule of activities surrounding her family and community. She is discreet and is not the type of woman who feels that she has to know and approve of her husband's every move.

N/A. Subject has had the same cover and position since originally hired by the Agency. Prior to Agency employment, he was employed by the FBI In Mexico.

N/A. Subject will retire from Agency employment this year.

There are no plans to use Subject's services after his retirement.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeremy K. BENADUM

During the past three months I have had the opportunity to work with and direct the activities of Jeremy K. BENADUM. Within a few months he will be retired from further service and it is appropriate now to review his past performanco and presont status in order that this remain a permanent part of his record.

BENADUM, during the past ten years, has performed as the outside case officer for the LITEMPO Project, He was pressod into service after resigning his position with LNERGO, for whom he worked for a period of twenty years. His primary value to the Station, at that time, was his access to persons of all-levels within the Mezigan Covernment and especially the Mexican Security Service. On further investigation it became clear it was his close personal and official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offered him this access across the board. Gradually over the years he developed a similar relationship with LITEPO-12, LITEMPO-4 and others.

His past evaluations are still valid, however, during the past three months he has gradually been phased out of liaison contacts and has been used principally to assist the Station in its orderly liaison transition. He is currently in touch with two liaison types officially but occasionally sees others on a purely social basis.

Although his retirement is not voluntary, he has good-naturedly assisted the Station in this very sensitive and delicate changeover. He will remain in Mezico after his retirement and has offered his assistance if needed. He presents no overriding handling problem, reports promptly and does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings.

Chief of Station, Mexico City/LITEMPO/Jeremy K. BENADUM - Agent Evaluation

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information

REFERENCES : A. JIMMA-32877, 28 August 1967
B. DIRECTOR-99063

1. In accordance with the request made in Reference B, the following is an up-dated Agent Evaluation on Jeremy K. BENADUM, Career Agent and outside Case Officer for the LITEMPO Project. This evaluation should be considered in conjunction with Reference A, which is still valid and more extensive.

2. BENADUM continues to perform as the Outside Case Officer for the LITEMPO Project in a professional and efficient manner. The relationships he has developed with persons of all-levels within the Mexican Government and especially the Mexican Security Service allow him to obtain information of great interest to WOFIRM which might otherwise be unavailable. For example, via LITEMPO-12, Chief of a special investigative unit, the Station receives carbon copies of the reports prepared by the group. BENADUM also is able to ask this group to conduct investigations or provide file checks on persons of interest to the Station.

3. BENADUM is able to stablish a system whereby persons of interest residing in PERU may obtain Mexican entry visas without the long delay usually required.

4. BENADUM writes well and has improved considerably in providing information he obtains from his contacts in written fore. Usually, the reports he submits need little editing in order to be processed for dissemination.

5. This Officer speaks Fluent Spanish which enables him to communicate with the persons with whom he meets in a free and easy manner. This ability certainly has assisted BSADES in establishing the rapport and confidence so necessary in working with Latins, especially those working for the host goveroment.

6. BENADUM presents no overriding handling problems for his Station Case Officer. He is willing to work long hours, reports promptly and does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings. Based upon the Regular Fitness Report system, this Officer could bo rated as STRONG in judging his performance.

7. BENADUM is the only other Station Officer besides the CB who has good and ready access to various personages within the Mexican Government. With the departure of Willard C. CURTIS, the value of BENADUM to the Station should not be underestimated.

8. BENADUM was shown this evaluation in draft form.

SUBJECT: Assessment of Career Agent, Jeremy K. BENADUM

1. Pseudonym and salary: Jeremy K. BENADUM, CS-15, $14,055.

2. Division or Staff and city: WH Division, Mexico City.

3. Operational duties: Subject maintains unofficial liaison between the Station and a Mexican Ministry. He also develops independent agents.

4. Cover: Subject has Inmigrante-Rentista status which allows him to remain in Mexico indefinitely and the only restriction on his activity is that he cannot be gainfully employed. In view of the fact he is a wealthy wan in his own right and will soon be of age to collect retirement from his long service with the FBI, this cover presents no problems. After five years in this status he will obtain inmigrado status which will give him complete freedom of operation, with all the rights as a Mexican citizen, except that of voting. The cover is excellent because it is secure, allows him complete mobility, and require no administrative support. There are no existing or anticipated problems related thereto.

5. Division's assessment: Subject is an experienced, well-trained, serious intelligence officer, capable of spotting, assessing, recruiting and handling agents. Most of his experience and capability is in the field of collection of FI intelligence and operational support, the latter being his most outstanding area of contribution to Station objectives, He would also be capable of running CI operations. His knowledge of CA type work, however, cannot be assessed at Headquarters.

Subject's cover is a natural one and poses no difficulties. Since Subject has been in the intelligence field for over 20 years, he is psychologically prepared for his dual role in intelligence operations and is well qualified to operate without strong Station support.

Headquarters is not in a position to comment on the timeliness or quality of his operational reporting, but no defects in this regard have been noted nor have any been brought to the attention of Headquarters by the Station,

Subject needs no training.

Jeremy K. BENADUM - Retirement, Report of Cover Earnings

Reference: Mexico City 3340

1. Reference indicated Jeremy K. BENADUM had proposed an extension of his retirement from 31 October to an appropriate date in December 1970 in order for him to use his annual leave in lieu of lump sum payment.

2. Shortly before the COS left Headquarters for Mexico, a meeting was held during which the Branch Chief discussed contract personnel of the Station.

Ref was discussed and it was the COS's desire for there to be an amicable separation at the time of BENADUM's retirement. If, therefore, the extra two months would accomplish this, then the added costs would be worthwhile.

3. The following annuity figures have been provided by the Retirement Office and are predicated on a retirement date of 31 December 1970. Please keep in mind, the figures must be considered as estimates and subject to verification of service and final computations. Retirement would be under the Organization Program.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeromy K. BENADUM

During the past three months I have had the opportunity to work with and direct the activitios of Jeremy K. BENADUM. Within a few months he will be retired from further service and it is appropriate now to review his past performance and present status in order that this remain a permanent part of his record.

BENADUM, during the past ten years, has performed as the outside case officer for the LITEMPO Project. He was pressed into service after rosigning his position with LNSRGO, for whoe he worked for a period of twenty years. His primary value to the Station, at that time, was his access to persons of all-levels within the Mexican Government and especially the Mexican Security Servico. On further investigation it bocane clear it was his close personal and official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offered him this access across the board. Gradually over the years ho developed a similar relationship with LITEMPO-12, LITEMPO-4 and others.

His past evaluations are still valid, however, during the past three sonthe he has gradually been phased out of liaison contacts and has been used principally to assist the Station in its orderly lisinon transition. He is currently in touch with two liaison types officially but occasionally sees others on a purely social basis.

Although his retirement is not voluntary, he has good-naturedly assisted the Station in this very sensitive and delicate changeover. He will remain in Mexico after his retirement and has offered his assistance if needed. Ho presents no overriding handling problem, reporte promptly and does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings.

ADMIN/CONTRACTS
Jeremy A. BENADUM

Reference: HMMT-10052

1. Reference asked Headquarters guidance in determining possible adjustment in the Quarters Allowance for Jeremy K. BENADUM, Career Agent. Reference stated:

--BENADUM purchased his local residence 1 December 1964 for $50,200 and cost of utilities average $98 monthly.

--Although the current maximum Quarters Allowance for BENADUM is $4,700 per annum, the Station has been paying at the rate of $4,128.96 per annum.

--Reference forwarded a list of BENADUM's estimates of utilities costs and a LNPURE memo on personally owned quarters.

2. The formula described in Para 3 of the LNPURE memo has been used in prior cases and is that which is also used by the Allowance Committee. Based on this formula, 10% of $50,200 (original purchase price) plus $1,176 (yearly utilities), total $6,196. The amount granted BENADUM would presumably be the maximum unless the Station had determined a lesser rate was applicable due to cover or operational reasons.

3. Using the effective date (5 October 1969) of the current Quarters Allowance rate $4,700 ($4,100 plus $600 for dependents) minus the rate being paid, $4,128.96 represents an increase of $571.04 per year or $47.58 per month.

For the period 1 December 1964 - 31 March 1965, BENADUM was paid quarters at the rate of $4,024.92 although the maximum allowance was $3,700 per annum. For the four months, BENADUM was overpaid $108.28 ($27.07 x 4).

Presuming the project has sufficient funds and the COS decides the maximum rate is applicable, the overpayment is to be offset against the increase.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Jeremy K. BENADUM

THROUGH : Head of Career Service

SUBJECT : Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their eventual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each employee at a point in service five years prior to the date of scheduled retirement. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to advise you that you are scheduled to retire in August 1975.

2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To assist you in this regard, the Agency will make available to you various resources which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. In October 1970, the Agency will conduct a Retirement Information Seminar to which you will be invited. Your spouse, if you are married, may accompany you to this seminar. Following the seminar, you will be invited by the Retirement Counselor for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling session (or more than one, if you wish); this phase of retirement planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement system under which you will retire. The individual counseling sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits, life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, relocation and movement of household effects and assistance in obtaining other employment, if appropriate. In addition to the sessions with your Retirement Counselor, you will be invited to avail yourself of selected literature on all aspects of retirement.

3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the scheduled date, or who wish to commence their planning as early as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe you would benefit from such an earlier start on your personal planning, you are invited to contact the Retirement Counselor responsible for your Directorate; he is assigned from your Directorate to the Retirement Affairs Division, 212 Magazine Building in Rosslyn, on telephone extension 3328.

4. Experience has amply demonstrated that careful planning facilitates the transition to retirement. I recommend, strongly, that you avail yourself of the services the Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

Subj.: PER EXPENSES FOR PERIOD 1 April, 1968 - 31 Oct., 1969.

Since December, 1968, when writer moved into his own home, he was not aware that receipts for utilities etc. would be necessary. As a consequence, the attached are not complete, but they are all that writer has been able to find.

1. Electricity: Receipts are complete.

2. Gas: Receipts are complete from Jan., 1969 to date. The 1968 receipts were destroyed, but the average consumption was the same.

3. Water: In writer's "colonia" there are no water meters. The cost of water, garbage collection, street lighting and cleaning etc. is included in a monthly quota which is paid to the Association of Colones. The quota was raised in September, 1969 from 75.00 to 200.00 pesos per month.

4. Fuel Oil: Writer found only one receipt during the period in question. Two more are attached to indicate the monthly expense.

5. Firewood: Writer has contracted with an Indian with two burros to deliver wood twice each month. Each delivery is 56.00. The Indian is illiterate and receipts are not feasible.

# PERSONALLY-OWNED QUARTERS

Because of the number of inquires received regarding personally- owned quarters, the following memorandum which has been sent to a number of posts may be useful as a guide to our policy on the subject:

When an employee occupies personally owned quarters his SF-1190 should show in Section 21 (5) the initial purchase price as shown by the deed. Section 21 (6) (7) and (8) should show annual rates for utilities as authorized by Section 132.5 of the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas). These are the only items of cost to be considered.

When the quarters allowance system provided for reimbursement for quarters costs within a predetermined maximum, the regulations provided that the allowance for personally owned quarters should not exceed 10 percent of the purchase price, converted to dollars at the exchange rate available at the time of purchase, plus allow- able utilities. The 10 percent of purchase price was ample to take care of taxes, depreciation, repairs, interest on investment, and amortization of the costs within a reasonable period of time by U. S. standards. Only light, fuel, and water could be added in arriving at the allowance.

Under the current quarters allowance system, it is expected that the flat rate will be paid unless the authorizing officer believes it necessary to reduce the payment under Section 134.2 of the Standardized Regulations. The employee in personally owned quarters would be treated the same as any other (except that he cannot receive advance payment of quarters allowances under Section 113 of the Standardized Regulations). This makes unnecessary a special rate for personally owned quarters. The requirement to report the purchase price on SF-1190 is to pro- vide the authorizing officer additional information to be considered, together with any other pertinent local circumstances, in deciding whether reduction of the allowance is necessary and, if so, how much. Only the utilities costs are to be considered in addition to the purchase price except in those rare instances where land rent is involved. Because of varying conditions between posts and individuals, it was not considered advisable to specify any certain percentage of the purchase price that should be considered.

In addition to the information on the SF-1190, the authorizing officer should consider local circumstances, which vary greatly from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally owned quarters should be treated any differently than the employee in rented quarters and receiving the flat rate allowance.

1.  In accordance with the request made in Reference B, the following is an up-dated Agent Evaluation on Jeremy K. BENADUM, Career Agent and outside Case Officer for the LITEMPO Project. This evaluation should be considered in conjunction with Reference A, which is still valid and more extensive.

2.  BENADUM continues to perform as the Outside Case Officer for the LITEMPO Project in a professional and efficient manner. The relationships he has developed with persons of all-levels within the Mexican Government and especially the Mexican Security Service allow him to obtain information of great interest to WOFIRM which might otherwise be unavailable. For example, via LITEMPO-12, Chief of a special investigativo unit, the Station receives carbon copies of the reports prepared by the group. BENADUM also is able to ask this group to conduct investigations or provide file checks on persons of interest to the Station.

3. BENADUM was able to establish a system whereby persons
   of interact to FOFIRM residing in PURUMEN may obtain Mexican entry
   visas without the long delay usually required.

4. BENADUM writes well and has improved considerably in
   providing information he obtains from his contacts in written form.
   Usually, the reports he aubmits need little editing in order to be
   processed for dissemination.

5. This Officer speaks fluent Spanish which enables him to
   communicate with the persons with whom he meets in a free and easy
   manner. This ability certainly has assisted BENADUM in establishing
   the rapport and confidence so necessary in working with Latins,
   especially those working for the host government.

6. BENADUM presents no overriding handling problems for his
   Station Case Officer. He is willing to work long hours, reports
   promptly and does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings.
   Based upon the Regular Fitness Report system, this Officer could be
   rated as STRONG. in judging his performance.

7. BENADUN is the only other Station Officer besides the COS
   who has good and ready access to various personages within the
   Mexican Government. With the departure of Villard C. CURTIS, the
   value of BENADUM to the Station should not be underestimated.

8. BENADUM was shown this evaluation in draft form.

Reference: HMMT-9712 dated 16 May 1969

1. Reference is made to conversations COS, Mexico City, had at Headquarters on 26 May and 27 May 1969 concerning the postponement of the effective date of retirement of Jeremy K. BENADUM until 31 October 1970 in order:

a). To enable BENADUM to acquire eligibility for WOFIRM retirement; and,

b). To give the new COS, Mexico City, time to build up relationships with the LITEMPOS (the LITEMPO Project) with whom BENADUM now has excellent, close and long-standing relationships.

2. Headquarters suggested that:

a). BENADUM sign the regular "Service Agreement" form by which he requests that he become a member of the WOFIRM "Organization Retirement and Disability System"; and, that

b). BENADUM write a memorandum requesting that his date of retirement be postponed from 30 June 1969 until 31 October 1970.

3. These two forms are attached, in the original and one copy each.

4. It is requested that, after receipt and study of the attachments and the attachments sent with reference, Headquarters cable Mexico City and advise whether or not BENADUM is now to be assured that his retirement date is 31 October 1970.

MEMORANDUM

28 May 1969

SUBJECT : Jeremy K. BENADUM - Request for Retirement

1. I herewith request that the effective date of my retirement be set as of 31 October 1970 instead of 30 June 1969.

2. This request is based primarily upon my desire to complete ten years of service in the Agency as is required by law in order to be eligible for Agency Retirement instead of being retired under Civil Services Statutes.

3. Secondly, however, I believe that by remaining in my present position until 31 October 1970 I can assure a better turn-over of contacts I have with a great deal less loss to the Agency.

4. I should appreciate a reply as soon as possible, since if my proposal is not accepted, I shall plan to accept other employment on 1 July 1969.

H/W ATT MENT 1 TO: HT-5712, 1 MAY 1969

7 April 1969

SUBJECT: Retirement

1. Reference is made to our conversations concerning the possibility of your retirement from our service.

2. I discussed this matter, along with all other personnel matters, while in Washington in March 1969; and the authorities indicated that they would like your retirement to become effective on 30 June 1969.

3. For your information, a drive is on to have officers over fifty years of age take advantage of the early retirement program, in order to:

a. Allow younger officers to move into active operational assignments;

b. Reduce expenses, by getting rid of the higher ranking (older) officers;

and

c. Put the early retirement program into effective use and make it customary for fifty year old officers to retiro.

4. In order to carry out your retirement, I would appreciate it if you would submit your letter confirming that you are in accord with this plan to place you on retired status.

5. You should plan to dispose of the Government owned vehicle on or near your retirement date. As you know, this is accomplished by obtaining at least three bids, which you should report in writing, and then by selling to the highest bidder. Also, any contract on rental of the office-apartment you use which involves this office should be ended.

6. I regret that you will be unable to take home leave at Government expense; but regulations prohibit the payment of homu leave expenses for persons within two years of effective rotirement date.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 134

7. The amount of your annual annuity, the pay allowable for your accumulated annual leave and other data relative to your retirement will be discussed in memoranda to follow.

8. I am in the same "boat" with you on several of the above items, if that is of any comfort.

9. Please sign this memorandum and return it to me.

México, D.F.

21 April, 1969

SUBJECT: Involuntary Retirement

1. A deak officer from Headquarters visited the Mexico City Stetion during mid-November, 1968. While here, the visiting officer talked with the writer for approximably one hour regarding the operation of the Litempo project and writer's plans for the future. The following points were discussed:

(a) The fact that the project was considered to be an important and successful one.

(b) Writer was specifically asked if he had any plans for an early retirement. Writer replied in the negative. The visiting officer indicated complete satisfaction with writer's desire to continue in the service, and noted that it would be particularly important in view of the upcoming change of Mexican administrations in December, 1970, and the necessity of keeping the project functioning at its current level of effectiveness.

(c) When the visiting officer asked whether the writer had ever visited Headquarters during his career with the service, and found that he had not done so, the officer asked whether writer could arrange to visit Headquarters for a week or ten days during his next home leave, which would take place in August, 1969. Writer indfonted that he would be most pleased to do 80.

2. Based on the foregoing, writer made plans to proceed to the United States on home leave in early August, 1969, to return in mid-September, 1969. Since such matters cannot be handled on short notice, writer has already rented a house in San Francisco, California for the period in question.

3. This is where matters stood, when, on 7 April, last, writer was advised that he would be retired, effective 30 June, 1969, in accordance with various changes of polioy. He was also asked to confirm in writing that he is in accord with the plan to place him on retired status as of 30 June, next.

4. While the reasoning behind what appears to be a complete reversal of policy, vis-a-vis the writer, may be crystal clear to the responsible officials at Headquarters, writer is at a complete loss to understand.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 150

- 2 -

For the writer to indicate his agreement with a plan which appears to him to be arbitrary, short-sighted and irrational, would be completely out of character for a person who has spent almost thirty years in the intelligence field, and has a justifiable pride in his status as a professional intelligence officer. As a professional, writer also realizes when the handwriting, however illegible it might be, is on the wall, and, that if the decision has already been made to retire him involuntarily, then retired he will be --- involuntarily. Little as it may matter, writer desires to emphasize that nothing in this memorandum should be construed to indicate writer's personal accord or approval.

5. According to writer's records, as of 30 June, next, he will have completed the following government service:

|                                                                                                        | Yrs. | Mos. | Days |

Writer desires to complete thirty years' service, and requests that the effective date for his involuntary retirement be set accordingly.

6. Home Leave: While writer readily understands the rationale of a ruling preventing the taking of home leave at government expense within two years of voluntary retirement, he does not see that the interests of fairness, justice or decency are being served in attempting to apply the same ruling to writer's involuntary retirement. As a matter of possible historical interest, writer desires to point out that, when he joined the service in 1930, he voluntarily gave up the home leave which he had earned with the (3 years). Writer has


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

-3-

taken home leave in 1962, 1964 and 1966, in accordance with regulations. In line with what appeared to be Agency policy as of November, 1968, writer has made plans for home leave from 5 August to 15 September, 1969. Writer feels most strongly that he and his family should be allowed to take this lea ve at government expense.

7. Future of Project: Writer would be less than candid if he did not point out that the present success of the project is owing in large measure to contacts which writer has developed over an eighteen year period. The precipitous forced retirement of writer will preclude an orderly and intelligent period of transition, with a concomitant loss of effectiveness. Even though he is being retired, writer is still interested in preserving the results of his work in Mexico, which writer regards as being of continuing importance to our country.

8. In conclusion, writer wishes to state that he has thoroughly enjoyed his association with the Agenay during the past nine years, and is proud of his part in the accomplishments of the México City Station. Owing to the nature of writer's position, his personal contacts have been largely limited to the personnel of the Station here. The writer has the highest professional and personal regard for the Chief of Station, with whom he has been privileged to serve, as well as the highly competent case officers who have worked with writer on the project.

It is a scurse of great satisfaction and pride to the writer to have known and worked with a truly great American, Mr. Allen W. Dulles, whom the "San Francisco Chronicle" (generally a hostile critic of the Agency) described posthumously as "...The most creative, powerful and eminent U.S. intelligence officer of modern times". And, as one's career comes to a close, the words of President Nixon, in describing Mr. Dulles' great contribution to his country, have a very particular significance: "...In the nature of his task, his achievements were khoan to only a fow. But, because of him, the world is a safer place today".

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

THROUGH: Deputy Director for plans

SUBJECT: Clarification of Cover Income Status of Career Agent Jeremy K. BENADUM

1. During the recent audit of WH Division, we noted that, since October 1961, Career Agent Jeremy K. BENADUM has not submitted cover income reports. These reports are required every six months by BENADUM's contract. Office of Finance personnel informed us that, since his payroll file does not indicate that he is under a cover activity, they do not expect these reports to be submitted and therefore have not requested them. However, operational files in WH Division Mexico Branch indicate that BENADUM owns his own business in Mexico City, is a member of the Board of Directors of another business, and spends a portion of his duty hours on these businesses. Therefore, it appears that BENADUM may be receiving cover income which should be refunded in accordance with his contract. In addition, the question arises as to whether BENADUM's contract should contain the provision (similar to Douglas J. FREAPANE's contract) that he can retain only the first $2,000 a year company profits as provided in FN 20-32.

2. It is requested that a review be made to determine whether BENADUM should be refunding cover income and whether his contract should be amended as indicated. Please notify this office of the results of this review.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Jeresy K. BENADUM (p)

SUBJECT: Federal Tax Obligation - Letter of Instruction

1. Based on the tax briefing held on 16 February 196 by a representative of the Organization's Tax Committee, the Committee approved a flat rate assessment of your covert Federal tax obligation. This assessment has been developed in two stages: The first stage applies to tax year 1965 and is based on your taxable compensation of $18,303.20. The second stage relates to your future year tax position and is based on an average of your annual Organisational income of $19,305.60 developed from a two-year projection of your earnings, beginning with tax year 1966. Under this procedure you will not be required to file a covert tax return, beginning with tax year 1965.

2. Effective 20 December 1964, the beginning of tax year 1965, the Organization has applied a tax percentage of thirty (30.0) per cent to the gross taxable compensation paid by the Organization in 1965. Effective 19 December 1965, the beginning of tax year 1965, this percentage will be decreased to twenty-three and four-tenths (23.4) per cent.

3. The application of the percentage assessment to tax year 1965 results in a tax liability of $5,490.96 (30% or $18,303.20). After applying the tax withheld of $2,562.49, an additional payment of $2,928.47 is required. However, future changes in your income or tax status may justify a future revision of the assessment rate. In this event, this agreement would be amended accordingly.

4. The Tax Committee has granted you a basic $250.00 tax credit in computing the percentage rate. This credit is granted to give reasonable assurance that you will not pay higher tax than you would under ordinary reporting procedures. The computations of these percentage rates are attached.

5. The retroactive satisfaction of this assessment from 19 December 1965 will be made by attaching the Federal tax withholdings available in your pay account. You will be advised as to the effect of this payroll account adjustment. You must file a tax return directly with Internal Revenue consistent with your overt tax status and provide the Tax Committee with a certified true copy. It is extremely Important for you to exercise care and accuracy in preparing this return. Provided below are specific criteria to assist you:

You will continue to file a tax return directly with Internal Revenue, reporting other income (interest, dividends, rental, etc.) and computing tax thereon. Any earnings received from a commercial


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 185

source are reported on the Form 2555 (Statement to apport Exclusion of Incosa Larned Abroad) and excluded under the bona fide residenco exclusion.

Any tex liability resulting from overt filing will be set by you separately from the covert tax assesment funds collected by the Organization.

6. You have recourse to the Organization for reimbursement of bona fida foreign income or related taxes paid on income received from or guaranteed by the Organization, in accordance with FHB 30-1, paragraph 45, (a) and (b).

7. Please acknowledge the original of this lotter and return to Headquarters, attention: Covert Tax Comedttoo.

8. The Tax Committeo appreciates your cooperation in establishing this systomized method of satisfying your Federal tex liability on Organisational income.

SUBJECT:
Career Agents - Legislative Pay Adjustments

ACTION REQUIRED: Information

1. During Robert L. EASBY's recent TDY at Headquarters, he informed Howard D. MYNARD that the last Legislative Pay Adjustment had not been granted to the following named Career Agents at the Station. He was advised that follow-up action would be taken and information forwarded to the Station.

   Jeremy K. RENADUM

   Douglas J. FREAPANE

   Victor W. OSOLD

   Wallace C. RIKON

   Donali E. VELAZQUEZ

   David F. WILSTED

2. The contract for each of the above named individuals except VELAZQUEZ contains the provision he shall receive any Legislative Pay Adjustment adopted by KUBARK. As the provision is a contractual item, the individual will automatically receive the increase without any requirement for a specific request or justification. Although not on the above list, the same information also pertains to Leo C. EDLICH. VELAZQUEZ, a Contract Employee, was authorized the increase (Phase II) by an amendment effective 14 October 1962 as his contract does not provide for automatic entitlement.

3. The Payroll Branch advised that except for RENADUM, the increase was reflected in the pay period ending 18 January 1964 as indicated in the earnings statement provided each individual. HM13-3534, 28 May, was sent to the Station by Payroll to increase RENADUM's field allotment in accordance with the pay adjustment.

Term Life Insurance Premium - Jeremy K. BENADUM

For your Information

Ref: Hqrf-2907

1.  BENADUM'S application for the Term Life Insurance, together with the payment of $72.00 for the six months' premium have been received. His life insurance is now paid up through December 1962.

2.  BENADUM did authorize deductions to pay the insurance premiums, but since he is being payrolled in the field, it will be necessary for him to forward future premium payments to Headquarters.

For your information

"413"-(CHICA "X" OND)

1.  The Station was surprised to receive the reference, which stated that BENADUM's life insurance application had not been received in Finance Division as of 15 June 1962. Recently we received 1824-S-2450, dated 14 June 1962, which requested that the Station collect from BENADUM the premiums for his life Insurance, and no mention was made of payroll deductions we had requested in 1824-T-2800. Therefore, the Station collected the sum of $72.00 from BENADUM in payment of 6 months premiums. This payment was forwarded to Headquarters under HMM-T-2892.

2.  No action will be taken by the Station to change BENADUM's field allotment until notification is received from Headquarters. It would appear that the easiest means of now adjusting his pay account would be to refund the pre-paid premiums and begin payroll deductions for the life Insurance.

It can collect all monies paid to BENADUM under his oral agreement, whereupon Headquarters can effect payment of salary and allowances effective 30 October 1960.

Please advise Headquarters which method the Station and BENADUM prefer.

In order to establish BENADUM'S leave record with KUDARE, BENADUM should furnish any final pay slip he might have received, which would reflect the amount of annual and sick leave he had as of his date of resignation and also, his salary rate at the time of resignation. If BENADUM has no such slip, a certified statement of the above is required. Since BENADUM's contract is effective 30 October 1960, the day after the end of his annual leave for 1960, BENADUM must return to AUBARA the gross amount he received from CDENVY for his "accrued carry-over" of 633 hours.

h. BENADUM should be told that he must advise KUBARI, should he still be in our employ, before he applies for CDYNY retirement for which he will be eligible when he becomes 50 years of age because of his CDNVY service.

9. The Station should return to Headquarters the original signed copy of the attached contract. The copy may be retained by the Station.

The station has two choices. To either collect all monies paid to BEACON under 530 oral agreement, whereupon headquarters can consider 3% commission of total monies collected retroactive to October 1963. Or alternatively, the remitted would be for the station to satisfy headquarters of a breakdown of what has been paid BEACON, on the basis of which headquarters would start prorating BEACON, deducting any overpayment of salary from net salaries due. Please advise headquarters which method the station and BEACON prefer.

3. In order to establish ADU/ADPE's leave record with FIWARE, BEACON should furnish any final pay slips he might have received, which would reflect the amount of annual and sick leave he had as of his date of separation and also, his salary rate at the time of separation. If BEACON's contract is effective 30 October 1963, the day after the end of his annual leave for 1963, BEACON must return to FIWARE the amount he received from CANTV for his "annual anniversary" of his leave.

4. BEACON should be told that he must advise FIWARE, should he still be in any employ, before he applies for GOLD retirement, whether he will be eligible then to because 10 years of age because of his CANTV service.

5. The station should return to headquarters the original signed copy of the attested contract. The copy may be retained by the station.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Clifford A. Fenton, Jr.

FROM: Jack Moriarty

RE: Peter Carroll Glynn, Jr.

DATE: April 25, 1977

001304

Pursuant to an earlier phone contact, I interviewed Mr. Glynn on his job at 4301 Suitland Road, Suitland, Maryland at 2:35 p.m. Friday, April 22, 1977. Subject is employed as an Intelligence Analyst by NOSIC (Naval Oceanic Surveillance Information Center) 763-2258 and resides at 107 Howard Street, Dumfries, Virginia, 221-8748.

He was serving with the U.S. Army on 11-22-63 assigned to Fort Walters, Mineral Wells, Texas as a radio technician and as such regularly monitered messages between Mexico and Cuba. As a result, he overheard comments in the sphere which were adverse to the newly assassinated President and were upsetting to him. Although he doesn't recall the exact dialogue, the gist concerned the humor found by the Cubans and Mexicans appraising this murder as being done by his own people and yet suspecting foreigners like themselves.

Consequently, it has occurred to Glynn that we may benefit by causing a thorough check to be made of the ASA (Army Security Agency) who Glynn believes recorded all such messages usually in tape form-and stored same. He also prepared dossier of which he gave me the original and one copy.

He goes on to say their mission at Fort Walters was labeled a training mission and, as such, was comprehensive enough to encompass the recording of all such collateral messages. Additionally, he recalls the Mexican sending station used the name of "Chihuahua."

3. In a report dated 19 October 1963, source un.cnown, it was stated that one Osvaldo RELOVA Penichet was appointed administrator of "Envases del Cerro, S.A." firm, located on Calzada del Cerro Avenue, Habana..

4. A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 23 October 1963 revealed that Osvaldo RELOVA, First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in Canada, left Kingston for Toronto on 21 October 1963, on TCA flight number 885.

5. An official Canadian source, in a report dated 26 November 1963, said that Osvaldo RELOVA Ponicitet, born on 13 August 1930, was not the First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in Canada as previous reports stated. Rather, RELOVA, who was a frequent visitor to Canada, traveled as an "Embassy Inspector." He carried Cuban Diplomatic passport D/63/415 with Mexican visa number OF-7090; he had no Canadian visa. The address on his passport was given as 15/3 number 2419, Santa Fe Banch (sic). Habana. RELOVA entered Canada on 16 August 1963, destined to visit Jesus YANES Rodriguez, Cuban Commerical Attache in Montreal. He departed Canada for Mexico on 25 August 1963, in the company of Alberta MENDUCA.

6. A former Cuban Intelligence officer who has been living in the United' States since 1963 and whose reporting over the past nine months has proven reliable, gave the following information on 21 July 1964, on Osvaldo RELOBA Penechet (presumably identical with RELOVA):

   In early 1961, RELOBA was an administrator of a section of the Consolidated Hardware Stores and annexes. In late 1961 he went to see source to get help with an investigation on a Mr. BARRAL, Administrator of the Consolidated (sic). RELOBA was requesting source's aid in the belief that source was still working for G-2; source did not tell him otherwise. RELOBA is a new Communist who wants to be more than MARX and is trying to instruct everyone around him. Source said that RELOBA was born about 1934, is 164 pounds, five feet nine inches in height, has a medium thin build, a long face, and a long thin neck. He has dark eyes, black hair, is partially bald, and has a small, thin mustache.

Dear Lou:

With kind regards,

Cordially,

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

September 26, 1977

The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on House Administration
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am requesting that you consider authorizing a retroactive pay adjustment for a former deputy chief counsel of the Select Committee on Assassinations, Mr. Robert K. Tanenbaum. Mr. Tanenbaum's employment with the Committee was erroneously terminated at the close of business July 31-- three days prior to the date he actually left the Committee. This administrative error was an oversight, which went unnoticed until after the August pay period when he notified the Committee that he had not received a paycheck for August 1 through 3. His annual rate of pay was $36,000; therefore, the amount I am requesting he be retroactively paid is $300.

Mr. Tanenbaum was a valuable employee, well thought of by the Committee. I regret the error and am hopeful that you will grant this request providing Mr. Tanenbaum the pay he has earned. If there is anything further I can provide, please do not hesitate to let me know. Your attention to this matter is very much appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

LOUIS STOKES
Chairman

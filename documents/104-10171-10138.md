TO: Chief, WZ

FROM: Chief of Station, Paris

DATE: 5 February 1953

SUBJECT:

GENERAL: Fritz (aka Fred) SNSCI

Reference: State Dept Control Cable 1437, 14 Nov 52, from Bonn

1. On 11 June 52, the Press Attache of the Paris Embassy wrote us the following memorandum:

According to French records, Fred SNSCI was born May 31, 1903 in Berlin. He was trained as a lawyer, left Germany in 1931, and appeared in France in 1933. In 1939, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion. Some time in 1940, he was demobilized in Morocco. He fled to Switzerland in 1942, and returned to Paris in May 1945. Since that time, he has worked for "Die Zeit" in Zurich, "Libera Stampa," a Socialist daily in Lugano, and other papers. In 1949, he went to work for "Die Welt," the British-controlled newspaper in Hamburg. In February 1951, he was replaced on that paper by a German. At the present time, he works for "Radio Saarbruecken," as well as for "Der Bund." He was naturalized French in 1947.

Recently, he was cleared by SHAPE to see everything from the Pyrenees to the Elbe. He did so and made a report on the Atlantic Forces. His articles were considered OK by the French, and even were translated in the press review bulletin, "Documentatica."

Some time after the articles had appeared, however, a French official expressed astonishment that SNSCI had been given such aid and accreditation. Though he had no proof to offer, this same official made the statement that SNSCI was known to the French as an agent of the Cominform. He gave no further derogatory information.

2. We searched our files, found no previous record of Subject, and informed the Press Attache accordingly.

3. On 17 Nov 52, the Press Attaché called our attention to State Dept. Control cable 1437, from ESCOM, dated 14 Nov 52, a copy of which is attached hereto for your convenience. Basing our request on the information contained in para 1 above, and on the attached cable from Bonn, we submitted queries concerning Subject to both UNION and UNBOUND.

4. On 23 Jan 53, we received the following reply from UNBOUND:

Fritz (aka Fred) SIRSCU, born 31 May 1903 in Berlin, of German origin, the son of Willy and Bertha TURIUF, acquired French nationality by naturalization on 1 April 1931. On 19 October 1933 in Paris 16e, he married his compatriot Edith STRIEBEL, born 24 August 1905 in Berlin. They have one child, born 25 May 1937, of French nationality.

SIRSCU joined the Foreign Legion in 1940 and was demobilized in February 1941. In August 1942, fearing lest he be interned in a camp in the unoccupied zone, he decided to go with his wife to Switzerland. Upon his arrival in Switzerland, he was arrested for clandestine border-crossing and interned in a camp at Martigny, (Valais). Later, he was transferred to a labor camp at Sterre. During his stay in Switzerland, he allegedly wrote several articles under the pseudonym "Basel" in the Swiss socialist press, notably in the paper "Libera-Stampa."

In May 1945, he returned to France and settled at Entraigues (Salce), where he still resides at 211 Avenue Pierre Brocolotto. Since 1945, he has had a legal office at 63 rue d'Hénouville, Paris 16e, where, according to a usually reliable source, it is reported to have held meetings with Konstantin OUMANSKY of the Soviet Commercial Mission (etc - see Ltr 14555) and with WOCHENIN of the Soviet Information Bureau. The activity of this legal office is, in fact, almost negligible.

Since 1945, he also has operated an office for the settlement of disputed claims for the international Reserve and Relief Committee (I.R.R.C.), 35 Bvd. des Capucines, Paris. He equally is administrator of the firm "Vank and Sluit" of Antwerp, Belgium.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILES

SUBJECT: Passing of KI reports to Brasilian Authorities.

REF: KP-4-513

33

29 October 1954

1. On 18 October, Marcos EASTOS, ALUMNI's colleague in the Brasilian Federal Political Police, informed him that on 15 October he had submitted to the Chief of Police a translation of the reports he had received from AERMANY. (EASTOS had been given by AERMANY sterilized versions of KI-1 to KI-15, inclusive, and KI-17 to KI-29, inclusive, along with the biographical information of the sources of those reports. KR-25 and KR-30 were not passed to EASTOS because they had been obtained from ALLOPATHY.)

2. On 27 October EASTOS informed ALUMNI that the translation of the reports had been forwarded by the Chief of Police to Colonel LOMBALDO, the present head of the Federal Political Police in Rio de Janeiro, who, in turn, had forwarded it to José PICAMILLI, head of the Political Division of the Political Police, for his recommendations. EASTOS stated that he believed PICAMILLI would recommend that the reports be forwarded to the Foreign Office and the War Ministry. EASTOS also intends to give a copy of the translations to Ribeiro de ALMEIDA, head of the Servicio de Vigilancia of the Department of Political and Social Order (D.O.P.S.), São Paulo, who has indicated an interest in receiving it.

3. As an introduction to the translation of the reports, EASTOS described briefly Brasil's Stateless refugee immigration problems and the voluntary welfare organizations which assist the immigrants in gaining entry to, and settling in, Brasil. The translation of this introduction is as follows:

"The current immigration of White Russians into Brasil began in 1919. It has diminished since June 1954 in the face of the decision taken by the National Institute of Colonization and Immigration (Istituto Nacional de Imigração Colonização) (N.I.I.C.) on 16 June 1954. On that date, the Directorate of the N.I.I.C. decided to request that the Ministry of Foreign Relations take the necessary steps to stop the issuance of visas for stateless persons for a period of sixty days."

"On 30 June, Vicente Rao, then Foreign Minister, sent a circular to all the consulates ordering a stoppage in the issuance of visas until a final decision could be reached."

"On 22 September, the Foreign Office issued to the consulates new instructions, according to which, generally speaking, stateless immigrants are permitted entry to Brasil only if they have in Brasil relatives in the direct line of descent whose economic situation is such that they can guarantee the subsistence of the immigrants."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 7

Nevertheless, it may be noted that there are various stateless persons in Hong Kong, with their respective passports in order, awaiting accommodations on one of the five ships of the Hong Kong-Buenos Aires line: the *"BOISSEVAIN", "TJISIDANE", "TELLEROS", and "TJIALENKA".*[^1]

The difficulties which the international organisations encounter in obtaining complete and reliable information on the immigrants are due to a large extent to the fact that those immigrants always reside in areas far removed from the locales of the organizations' offices. One must also recognize the fact that included among the stateless immigrants is a large number of persons useful to Brazil, such as the following types of workers: mechanics, engineers, electricians, chemists, etc.

There are twelve international organisations who are responsible for preparing the immigrants for the journey - or better, the cult - of those stateless refugees from China and various European countries. They are:

1.  A.J.D.C. - American Joint Distribution Committee, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.
2.  E.O.I. - Entr'Aide Ouvriere Internationale (International Workers' Mutual Aid)
3.  H.I.A.S. - Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.
4.  I.C.M.C. - International Catholic Migration Commission, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.
5.  I.S.S. - International Social Service, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.
6.  I.R.C. - International Rescue Committee. Has no representatives in Brazil.
7.  L.W.F. - Lutheran World Federation, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.
8.  N.C.W.C. - National Catholic Welfare Conference, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.
9.  S.A.E. - Swiss Aid to Europe. Has no representation in Brazil.
10. T.F. - Tolstoi Foundation, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.
11. U.U.A.R.C. - United Ukrainian American Relief Committee.
12. W.C.C. - World Council of Churches, with offices in Rio and São Paulo.

"Two of those organizations handle the largest number of arrivals. One is the W.C.C. whose office in Rio is located at Praia do Flamengo, 180, apt. 602; its office in São Paulo is at Rua D. Veridiana, 393. The São Paulo office is under the direction of Miss Rachel de CARVALLO.[^2] The other organization is the N.C.W.C., whose office in Rio is at Avenida Churchill 60; its office in São Paulo is in the Church of Peace (Igreja da Paz) on Rua Alvares Penteado e Rua Libero Badaro, 377/393/399, 9th floor on Rua Alvares Penteado e Rua Libero Badaro, 377/393/399, 9th floor on Rua Alvares Penteado e Rua Libero Badaro, 377/393/399, 9th floor Lívio.[^3]

"Since 25 April 1954, many stateless persons who have been unable to obtain a visa for Brazil, Canada or Australia have been repatriated to the U.S.S.R. As a result of this repatriation, it is possible, though not probable, that some elements may be sent from China to Brazil to engage in subversive activities here, while members of their families, who have been repatriated to Russia, are held as hostages there."

[^1]: The last word is unreadable.
[^2]: The office has more rooms.
[^3]: The director is Father Lívio.

Subject: Joseph LE GRAND Report No: KP 5929.

Place Acquired: France, Paris Date of Information: Current

Evaluation: () Date Acquired: 8 January 1952

Date of Report: 12 January 1952

Source: Through a fairly reliable source from an informant with A contacts.

1.  Joseph LEGRAND, involved in the "Promoter affair" and as a result expelled from the Central Committee of the PCF in the Spring of 1951, was recently re-appointed the position as Administrative Secretary of the Regional Miners Federation (COF) in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais regions. Augusto ISCARI was instrumental in securing this reassignment for LEGRAND, according to source.

2.  XERGES (Leon) and KOEHLY (Lalla) who were in charge for two years of the reorganization of the Regional Federation have been placed under LEGRAND's orders and have been charged with "insufficient action".

3.  LEGRAND has been given "full powers" to visit all syndicates and to eliminate those elements judged unnecessary, reducing the directing organisms of the various syndicates. Source stated that LEGRAND's activities are partially dictated by financial necessity and that staffs will be reduced for economic reasons.

4.  HERMETZ (fim), Secretary of the Miners' syndicate of Comin (Nord), has been charged with reorganizing the Valenciennes sector, in particular the Calais-sous-Douai region, which "has fallen into lethargy as a result of the inertia of the trade union (Callo)". According to sources, GIL, former Secretary General of the miners COF syndicate in Anzin, has for some time been in line for dismissal as a result of lack of discipline and incompetence in syndicate affairs. However, no one wanted to take the responsibility for dismissing him, the first act performed by LEGRAND in his new position was to fire him.

5.  It recently confirmed that he has also been given full power to purge miners syndicates and that HERMETZ (Charles) will not be a COF candidate in the next elections for miners' delegates.

Peter SCGC

1. The following information on Frederic SESC, believed to be identical with your subject, has been translated from a news report in German received from a "well-placed source in the West German Government", and transmitted to headquarters in I02/KAI, 4 March 1954:

Name: SESC, Frederic (Afred)

Born: 31 May 1900 in Berlin

Address: Nantsschl o/Solna, Pill Aysnus, Stockholm

Professions: Journalist, currently correspondent of the Swiss newspaper "Vor Lund", the German daily "Die Welt", and of "Radio Stuttgart".

A politically doubtful person who received an entrance visa for West Germany valid for six months on 23 January 1952. According to information from the French Ministry of Interior (the S.I.I.), SESC was working for the Communist paper "Die Zukunit" (Hunsberger) before the war and during the war for the Swiss Communist newspapers "Die Tat", "Volkszeitung", and "Arbeiterzeitung". Allegedly not a Communist.

At any rate so stated the present Press attache of the Consul General to the German Consulate General, Paris, Koxemer/KO-He Pfenning, on whose behalf SESC applied for a visa. On January SESC submitted a written application on behalf of the newspaper, "Die Welt", "Stuttgart" (Radio), Frankfurt U.: Nationalliberale Partei Deutschlands (Joy) from 1954 to

Next, where he acquired French citizenship. According to his own statement, he was advised by the West German Press Office in Bonn to apply again for German citizenship as be,

afterall, vas waiting for German newspapers. Hanner,
he declined, stating that he had a bad press in Bonn. He further stated that he had serious differences of opinion with Paul BAECOLI, Allemann's former press chief.
When Hanner was not yet Chancellor of West Germany, but only President of the Parliamentary Council, he has refused permission to interview Allemann during his Swiss conference. He has never forgiven him for this.

2. To note that there are several references to Alexander KIRCHNER (presently, Alexander  Kirchmayer) in Wilhelm Hoegner file (see WILHELM), 12563, 12715, and 12717, and that LUDEMANN has been closely associated with William Clumberg, Georg Munst and, probably, others of the Lutz/Heidenmann group. We are also interested in the fact that WILHELM was introduced to CLUMBERG by Leo SPAELLER. To consider if Alexander Alexandrovitch WLADIMIROV, vice Consul at the Soviet Consulate in Paris, and a suspected NKVD agent, and if BILLANFF has been in contact with WLADIMIROV is alleged.

3. The Hans DURANDT now in Paris as economic correspondent for "der Bund", probably is identical with the Hans LUCHARDT mentioned in the "Final EQUAL Report" (KLA-3160, Part III, Vol. I, p. 34, which states:

> Hans DURANDT
> Address: Deals, 6 Paris
> Nationality: German, born 9 September 1906 in Leier
> Occupation: Journalist. 1936-1938 in Paris as representative of "Europa Presse" of Frankfurt-am-Main, end of
> "Presse Telegraphique Suisse" of Berne.
> Liaison: Unknown, but contact of FOOTEL (Alexander) during war.

Part III, Vol.11, P. 31 of the "Final EQUAL Report", of which you have a copy, lists a Charles SIBIUN, but there is no mention of Frederic (or Fritz) SIBIUN in the reports or in the Lota Lapallo.

4. We are unable to identify the (fn) LUCCHESI of the Soviet Information Bureau with whom SHEV and Konstantin OUMANSKY held meetings in 1945. The International Rescue (sic) and Relief Committee for which operates an office, in c/o International Rescue and Relief Committee offices at 43 rue de Friedland, New York City, and 33 Boulevard des Courcelles, Paris. The organization is an outgrowth of the former International Relief Committee and the Company Relief Committee. It was formed originally to assist refugees from Spain. Since 1945 it has functioned as an anti-fascist organization assisting refugees without regard to nationalities. Although not ostensibly a Communist organization, several Communists have been affiliated with it (see VOU-5634) and, therefore, membership in the I.R.R.C. should to viewed with some suspicion.

International Rescue Committee's Progress for Hungarian refugees

During a recent luncheon conversation the Ambassador suggested to General Donovan and other officers of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) that this organization might investigate the advisability of devoting part of its funds and efforts to the student groups among the Hungarian refugees. General Donovan and other members of the Board of IRC have acted favorably on this proposal. A memo of conversation attached as Enclosure 1 to this despatch indicates the general lines of action being followed by this organization.

General Donovan also discussed with Mr. R. R. Ervin, OFC, Frankfurt, the question of HIC administrative support for this IRP and student program and was counseled to submit estimates of the costs prior to contract negotiations.

For the Ambassador,

Alfred Puhan

First Secretary of Embassy

**Clarions Fall reports the aids of the International Rescue Committee to be as follows:**

1.  Care and maintenance of and counseling and other assistance to 1000 students (predominantly University rather than High School) for one year. Although I.R. will take care of these students, they live around, wherever they may be, the Austrian Government has agreed to pay 10 schillings per day for all of these students who remain in Austria. I.R. will endeavor to have some of its students qualify for scholarships offered by U.S. Universities and others for 500 scholarships offered by the French Government as well as any others which may be available. In the case of any student who obtains a full scholarship, I.R.C. assistance to him will consist primarily of counseling assistance and supplemental aid, if required.

2.  A hostel for 100 students is being established and will be operated near Paris by the French branch of I.R.C.

3.  I.R. is covering expenses of a student hostel in Vienna - estimated capacity 300 students.

4.  I.R. is covering the costs of a hostel for a reported 150 students in Wolfgangesse.

5.  I.R. has purchased a Volkswagen bus which starts operating as of today near Anton, shuttling refugees from the border to the collection station 6 kilometers away.

6.  I.R. will furnish 500 assurances under RP for the U.S.; 200 have already been covered. These assurances are not limited to students or intellectuals but the Committee would prefer to assist those types insofar as possible.

7.  Some time ago I.R.C. offered the Ministry of Interior to cover the cost of 1000 beds. At the time the deal was called off by the Ministry, since then the Ministry has not followed up I.R.C.'s proposal, (although I have personally repeated on occasion to Ministry officials that they should not let this opportunity drop), but I.R. still stands ready to cover its commitments.

REFUGEES LAY BE SENT TO U. S.

PROFESSIONAL
By Our Diplomatio Corespondent

A thousand Eastern European anti-Communist refugees of the professional classes may be sent for employment to the United States by the International Rescue Committee. Mr. David Martin, the Committee's Executive Director, is in London on his way to Paris and other capitals to investigate the scheme's possibilities.

It is also proposed to establish, probably in London and Paris, European institutes for the study by refugee experts of every aspect of life in East Europe. Mr. Martin said yesterday:

"The time has come when the free nations must use this case of human talent to record what is going on and to ensure there are groups available to revive culture in Eastern Europe when the time arrives. We are prepared to bring 1,000 intellectuals to the United States and could, I think, absorb 2,000 - 3,000."

On October 1, 1954, I received a letter from the Consulate in Genova. This letter stated that "If you would indicate the particular authorities here to whom the fact that this woman has proceeded to Mexico might be of interest, I shall be glad to communicate with them."

This office does not feel that we should tell the Consulate in Genova which American officers would be interested in the type of information set forth above. It is felt that you might wish to transmit this information.

1. Complain: In accordance with the request contained in Reference A, a summarized evaluation of the potentialities of Identity 1 was forwarded in Reference B. This dispatch is prepared to record in greater detail the information forwarded in Reference B and to report the latest developments concerning Identity 1.

2. Coveral weeks following the 17 June 1953 demonstrations, a group of East German refugees, who identified themselves as "strike leaders", was reported as forming Identity 1. From several sources, it was determined that this group was receiving financial and moral support, assistance and guidance from such persons as Eduard S. Von Vina, Paul V. Baudress and others who allegedly wished to create a real crime-formation for East Berlin resistance-type groups. It was previously known that Von Vina was very active for over six months attempting to establish a central file for information concerning East Germany to which all West Berlin organizations would be required to submit information. Publicly, his reason for this was to classify coordination activities among the Berlin groups, but it is known that his real reason was to establish a personal measure of control over all of these organizations. In the past, his efforts had been unsuccessful due to, among other factors, the absence of a consistent "courier" organization. The continuing efforts upon the part of DILDEI to regain the position he had prior to his dismissal from VILHEI are a matter of record.

3. It appeared that the creation of Identity 1 as a separate entity would not add anything of constructive nature to the general "cold war" front, and further, that its existence under the behind scenes guidance of the persons mentioned above could merely complicate the already complicated West Berlin scene. The EOD position was, therefore, to attempt to prevent the formation of Identity 1 and to resolute the tools available among the "strike leaders" upon an individual basis. Reference 2 contains a description of the activities of DILDEI in this regard.

4. On 10 July 1953, prior to the initial meeting of Identity 1, CADCIT invited the strike leaders to visit the CAEDOFF establishment to be briefed on the manner in which CAEDOFF carries out its East German program encompassed. During this visit, a member of the strike leaders discovered that the CAEDOFF East German program encompassed

all of the points which were hoped to be obtained by the formation of Identity 1, and since this would constitute an obviously undesirable duplication of effort, approximately ten of the "strike leaders" indicated that they would give their support to CADROIT or other existing organizations rather than to the new group. (The German language report of the CADROIT meeting is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment "A")

5. On 21 July 1953, a special meeting of various west Berlin government and resistance group representatives was called to discuss the feasibility and desirability of encouraging the formation of Identity 1. With few exceptions, all of the major organisations expressed the view outlined in paragraph 3 above. The suggestion was officially voiced that the members of Identity 1 should lend their support to existing organisations. (A German language report of this meeting prepared by the CADROIT representative is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment "B")

6. On 12 August 1953, a meeting was called by HICOG-EAD of representatives of U.S. intelligence organisations in Berlin. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the possibility that the formation of Identity 1 might constitute a threat to the security of american forces in Berlin. HICOG had also received an erroneous report that DILINEN and CADROIT were rendering Identity 1 financial support. The latter impression was corrected during the meeting, and it was determined that Identity 1 would probably not constitute a threat if it did not receive or develop financial backing. At the time of these discussions, it did not appear likely that Identity 1 would receive such support, and its assets would probably be absorbed in other West. Berlin or West German organizations. There were indications that several of the "strike leaders," with the aid of ZRCODIFY, were gaining employment in the Federal Republic.

7. The only direct contact established by BOB with any of the "strike leaders" was with Identity 2, who was considered for employment with DTLINEN. The nature of this contact is essentially covered in the following correspondence: SELLY CUCA, DIR 18181 and ICP-A 6120. Identity 2 was not hired by DILINEN.

8. On 17 October 1953, the Chairman of Identity 1, Identity 3, informed Nelson O. Leonard that he (Identity 3) intended to resign from Identity 1 since he was receiving insufficient support to make a living. He stated that although he was receiving some support from Identity 4, it was not enough to maintain his organization upon a working basis. Identity 3 said that he had made several radio appearances, and that as a result of these, Identity 1 had been receiving up to one hundred visitors a day. He reported that he had attempted to gain financial support from the West German Ministry for All German Affairs and other organizations, but had been unsuccessful. He then suggested to Leonard that Identity 1 and CADROIT could establish a covert working agreement with the latter organization furnishing the funds. The offer had one attractive aspect, namely, that CADROIT could, through the contacts of Identity 1, broaden its present mission and expand into other fields of psychological warfare. However, for the reasons outlined in paragraph 3 above, He was instructed to cover all contact with Identity 3. After he was informed that CADROIT would not endorse the suggested working arrangement, Identity 3 admitted to Leonard that there were undesirable elements within Identity 1 who would have to be removed before the organization could function effectively.

9. In accordance with the request contained in Reference A that a study of Identity 1 be made; discussions have been held with Identity 5. He stated that he was well aware of the activities of Identity 1 and that they were closely coupled with the development of the TROCCULT Berlin office. Shortly following the Stock- holm meeting of TROCCULT, Grambo, Identity 6 and others met with Identity 5 in Bar- lin to discuss the advisability of increasing the activities of TROCCULT in Eastern Germany. Identity 5 felt at the time that Grambo and Identity 6 appeared to be the force necessary to get TROCCULT on its feet in West Berlin. It was decided that TROCCULT would form a Berlin office which would be responsible exclusively for East German operations. Although the mission of this office was not initially established, discussion apparently centered about the formation of an underground trade union to oppose the East German FDGB. Identity 6 and Grambo indicated that funds in the amount of DM 1,000,000 would be provisionally available.

10. Identity 7, an East German refugee who was an active labor leader and had work- ed with the SFD Ostburo, was designated the chief of the new TIOCCULT office. He commenced work immediately, but it soon became apparent that he was not going to cooperate with either CADCNA or ZRCODIFY Berlin, other than to use the latter's offices. Identity 5 states that efforts were made by West German and Belgian rep- resentatives of TFOCCULT to bring Identity 7 into closer harmony with CADCNA, but those were fruitless. Identity 7 kept knowledge of his activities from ECODIFY members, and it also became apparent that he was not informing TrOCCULT of every- thing either. The latter has evidenced a growing distrust and dislike for Identity 7 which has almost approached the state of complete disassociation. (For recent evidence of TFOCCULT by-passing its own Berlin office, see E3D-A 11223 which des- cribes a TFOCCULT overture to DILINN.)

11. Since the TFOCCULT Berlin office was more or less an outgrowth of the 17 June demonstrations, it was natural that Identity 1 would seek a close working associa- tion with that group. An attempt was made, but apparently Identity 7, as an indi- vidual, prevented the establishment of an effective working relationship. On the other hand, CADCNA looked upon the TROCCULT office under the leadership of Identity 7 as an increasingly undesirable element in the Berlin and East German scene. Ac- cording to Identity 5, it was about this time that Boudreau began making overtures to CADCNA, reportedly acting as an "unofficial" representative of Identity 1. Since then, CADCNA apparently has considered Identity 1 as an activity to effect the un- desirable operations of Identity 7 and has reportedly been funneling funds (amounts unknown) to Identity 1, possibly through Boudreau. Identity 5 is aware that CADCNA speaks highly of Boudreau, an observation which has been reported by John W. Kahlert since also.

12. Identity 5 reported further that Boudreau has been quite active gaining publi- city for Identity 1. He has, for example, coordinated with Identity 8 in the prep- aration of an article concerning 17 June for Identity 9. During the Fall of 1953, Identity 8 introduced Identity 5 to Boudreau, and since that time, Identity 5 has frequently pressed Identity 5 for U.S. support of Identity 1. Identity 5 says told Boudreau that Identity 1 is completely a labor matter and that proper liaison should be made with either TFOCCULT or ECODIFY. Identity 5 introduced Boudreau to an American representative of the AFL, but there was no indication of the amount of interest the latter organization showed in the activity of Identity 1. Recently, Boudreau published a study of the events of 17 June (this source of funds for this venture is unknown, but Identity 5 suggested that they may have come from CADCNA). Boudreau, giving credit to Identity 1 for the material in this report.

has mailed copies of the booklet to prominent public figures throughout Last Ber-lin, among them Identity 5 and CALCHA. About one week after Identity 5 received his copy, sources telephoned him requesting comment concerning the publication and reiterating his former requests for U.S. support of Identity 1. (A copy of Bourgeau's booklet was given John H. Quaintance by CALCHA. This copy is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment "C")

13. It was reported in Reference 8 that Identity 5 felt that a major portion of Identity 1's financial support stemmed from Identity 10 sources, however, he now feels that what little support Identity 1 is receiving comes from CALCHA for the reasons outlined in paragraph 11 above. Identity 5 was aware that Identity 1 had received welfare items from Identity 4 for further distribution among the families of persons who had been arrested for taking part in the 17 June demonstrations. To his knowledge, however, no funds, as such, were ever given Identity 1 from this source.

14. Nelson G. Henard recently reported that Identity 3 has resigned from his posi-tion in Identity 1 and is now practicing law in Western Germany. Henard also stated that he has heard of no recent activity upon the part of Identity 1 and has heard of no replacement being named to fill the post vacated by Identity 3.

15. The membership list of Identity 1 as reported in DBM-207 agrees in part with a list forwarded by Henard. For comparison purposes, the latter list is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment "D".

16. Since it appears that Identity 1, although reportedly not very active, has been receiving a small amount of financial support from CALCHA, it is possible that a continued investigation of its activities may be warranted. If so, it is sug-gested that future queries be directed to John H. Quaintance, the DBMATT Case Offi-cer who has direct contact with CALCHA. Since the attachments are forwarded in single copies, it is requested that they be forwarded to the Home Office following perusal.

Chief, CI

Reference: Arisco/16, dated 31 October 1951

1. The files of this office reveal the following information concerning the subject:

(a) The name of Lordkipanidze appeared in connection with the Real and Ideal cause. The FBI report on the interrogation of the subject, dated 8 October 1947, stated that the subject have known both of them over a period of many years. They first lady then very intimately as A. causes. The FBI report on the subject who was foreign correspondent for the ministry in Germany where the kept them for almost 2 years and stated as their propagandist teacher. This report further stated that in 1937 after the subject had returned from Moscow having broken with the Russians, they came to often, and they found that the still friendly with both of the AROC officials and saw them from time to time.

(b) In a report dated 3 August 1950 revising his activities in Russia during the 1920s and 1930s, it was stated that FLOYD was still known to have enjoyed unusually close contact with Soviet officials particularly in the Soviet Foreign Office. It’s stated to have nothing like a Bolshevik journalist, was reported to have something like a Bolshevik journalist, was reputed to have something like a Bolshevik journalist, was reported to have something like a Bolshevik journalist, was reputed to have something like a Bolshevik journalist, were liquidated in and east of FLOYD's well-placed contacts were liquidated in and east of FLOYD's well-placed contacts were liquidated in the Great Purge of 1937-38, and all this contributed, no doubt, to FLOYD's disillusionment and disenchantment with the Soviet regime. In any event, he contrived with difficulty to get his Soviet-citizen wife out of the USSR.

LTC. Eleanor ROOSEVELT Intercession with Soviet Ambassador UMANSKY in Washington for the Soviet authorities were well aware by the time of FLOYD's defection. This

report also stated that FISCHL was active during the spanish civil war in support of the loyalists and was reputed to have had good contacts with the last Republican Prime Minister, NEGRIN, who was generally regarded as a Soviet stooge. However by this time FISCHL was regarded in Moscow as a "trotskyist." The report confirmed by stating that FISCHL had been very active in reporting the Italian intervention cause and was on very good terms with the USSR and at the same time he had become very critical of the USSR and generally. During 1949 and 1950 he displayed some interest in politics, and in Germany, where the then former Soviet citizens, and collaborated with Doris A. WlIKill publishing a book in the U.S. entitled INTERROG the V-I which is a compilation of the reputed life stories of career-tired, mainly from the vlasny movement.

In this report Karkaseba or Dorthy WISCHER, wife of Louis FISCHL, who was born in Latvia, is said to have written some books under the name of CHICHEBAU. At one time she was a secretary of CHICHEBAU, the early Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee, and Louis FISCHL met her while she was working for CHIHEBAU at the Caracas Conference in the early 1930s. Although she had been very strongly pro-soviet in Moscow, she reportedly very very bitterly hostile in her present anti-Soviet expressions and writings, since 1945 one-time in Caracas as the representative of Committee of Kay Krill. She was reported to have left Germany in 1945 to go to Italy there she was supposed to have worked on a dock cold to be a wife of flottica. The document stated that Karkaseba FISCHL was currently living at a farm which she owns at Kallara’s Church, Fa., near Quakertown, Pa., but that she was seeking employment again in work

Another section of this report was devoted to Pernices, son of Louis and Parkeesia FISCHL, who is sometimes known by the name of Dimitivo, educated in both Germany and Moscow and came to the U.S. co 14 years of age with his mother. He was graduated from the University of Wisconsin. Serving as a captain in the Air Force Intelligence during the war, he was used in discussions in where the knowledge of Russian proved very ess-ful. This report stated that following the war comrade FISCHL was at Harvard for several years on a Lowell fellowship and had been working on his doctorate for his doctorate. In this time doing considerable writing on the origins and history of the Vlassov Movement, his output being probably the best material avail-able. To obtain material for articles appearing in a number of American colleges, he made several trips to Berlin areas and other DP centers in Germany. His most recent trips were on behalf of the Russian Research Center of Harvard University, and he seemed to enjoy the confidence of Professors KARPOVICH and YAKOVLEV there. While in Germany in April, 1950, he was traveling on orders from the Air Force Intelligence. He is an officer of the Air

Varco Ecserva. This report further stated that in August 1950 he returned from another trip to Germany where he conducted negotiations for the Harvard Russian Research Center in connection with the establishment in Munich of a Russian Research Institute and also to arrange the details of the Harvard Russian Center's project of sending a group of students to Germany the autumn of 1950 to study the Russian emigration. He informed Professor FALCOV that upon his return he was withdrawing from further work for the Harvard Russian Research Center in order to concentrate on his thesis. George FLICHERO's principal contact in Germany was Boris EINOV, head of the Viasovity group, Salius Derleg as Covebosods Radael (Militant Union for Liberation of Peoples of Russia), the SOOUZ. On earlier trips he had been in touch with MY way, chief of SOOUZ's security section, but since LCCSTAFLV reported to be suffering from cancer and therefore not active, FLICHERO's later contacts with him were occasional. George FLICHERO is reported to have told Col. FOODIKAL.O7 in connection with research which FOODIAKOV was doing for Harvard, but VILIMA did not have close contacts with him.

(c) The FBI in an investigative report on Carol Bundy BRAIDS dated 4 January 1952 stated that an informant of known reliability advised that in October and December 1941 and also in January 1943 Louis Fischer, who then resided at Hotel Dauro, 25/ Madiscon Avenue, New York City, was in contact with Carol Hill, Literary agent, 22 East 12th Street, New York City. This report quoted a review of *[?] book [?] in the 12 May 1941 issue of [?] magazine. This review stated *[?] years Louis Fischer was the journalistic delegate from New York's Liberal [?] to the Russian Revolution.* It also described Fischer as an authority on Russian foreign politics and brought his close contact with Russian politicians.* According to this review, while dispatches of [?] correspondent in [?] Fischer's reports were objective and full of hostility to Russia, Fischer became the favorite Russian author of [?] U.S. Intelligentsia.* This report also stated that an informant of known reliability advised on 21 July 1951 that Fischer, a well-known Communist writer, was leaving for England and that another informant of known reliability advised that in 1937 Fischer was active with the Loyalist forces in Spain. In addition an informant of unknown reliability advised that Oscar J. [?] in February 1951 that he had no positive information but believed that Fischer was working for the CPD.

(d) In an FBI report on Coleman A. Nichols dated 21 February 1951, an informant of known reliability stated that he was now, reportedly a member of the Soviet Intelligence organization in the U.S. engaged in industrial espionage, as the [?] and [?] Fischer in Moscow in 1923. The report identified Fischer as an anti-Communist writer, author of [?] and [*?] *Petition*, who at that time was pro-Germanist and was in Moscow for the magazine, *[?]*.

(o) A GGC report on *[illegible]* and his wife dated 17 August 1950 in-cluded a list of *[illegible]* information indirectly obtained from the subjects. The name of Louis Fischer, 237 Madison Avenue, New York City 16, telephone number 1-2-3-[illegible]-9563 appeared several times and the date 15 December 1947 mentioned. The name of FISCHER also appeared on a list headed "Letters".

(1) In a document from a usually reliable source dated 27 September 1951, Louis FISCHER, an American citizen born in Philadelphia 17 February 1953, was reported as staying at the Hotel Imperiale in Rome from 3 April to 23 April accompanied by his alleged wife, Derta Fischer born in Latvia on *[illegible]*. He was in possession of passport No. 55603 dated 1 November 1950 and his wife, No. 257533 dated 23 February 1949, both issued in Washington. Derta was reported as departing for Florence on 7 April 1951 where it seemed she was joined by him. According to personnel of the hotel, Fischer claimed to be a journalist, but there were some doubts as to hotel personnel. When leaving Rome, he left his trunk with hotel personnel, and it was later picked up by an unidentified friend. In Rome Fischer had contacts with fellow-Americans. The purpose of his trip to Italy was unknown.

(7) A report dated 19 September 1951 stated that one GRAZI[illegible] and wife, and FISCHER and wife spent the holiday of Easter, 1952, at Voria (near Naples) together with the “well-known anti-Stalinist newspaperman, Louis FISCHER.” This report also stated that GRAZI[illegible] had Communist affiliation but that FISCHER gave no indication of being aware of this.

(h) In a report dated 22 December 1950 Louis FISCHER was included among delegates to a conference of the International Labor Organization to be held 1[illegible] December 190 in Lucknow, India. The report also stated that it was presumed that FISCHER was from France but that this was not definitely known.

(i) In a document dated 13 January 1951, Louis FISCHER was reported to have made contributions to the 3203., a political organization composed of the anti-Soviet remnants of the wartime Vlasov movement. 4303 carries on both overt and clandestine activities aimed at the eventual overthrow of Soviet dictatorship. The activities of this organization have been financed mainly by gifts, contributions, and indirectly by Harvard University through the Institute for the Study of the Soviet Union which is staffed wholly by 4303 personnel.

2. There is also a reference... Louis FISCHER in JFA-8135 dated 23 May 1951.

3. In requesting information concerning subject, JFA-9714 invited our attention to the following references: JFA-135 dated 24 December 1950, and [illegible] December 1950, and B.C. [illegible]'s memorandum of 5 January 1951. It is the opinion of Nicholas A. Benard, author of JFA-6135, that Louis FISCHER described in these references is not identical with Louis FISCHER cited in the KATZ synthesis.

TO: Chief FE (Attn: Chief SP)

FROM: Chief of Missi 4, Frankfurt

SUBJECT: GENERAL - REDSOX/AEPAR

REFERENCE: Assistance to Soviet Escapees Through USEP

FILE: 81-30972

1.  In a recent conversation with Mr. Richard R. Brown, OFCEP, Frankfurt, he read several portions of a letter which he had just received from his Washington headquarters directing some fairly strong criticism to the German country unit in its handling of the program. Needless to say, Brown was considerably upset since it appears that much of the criticism stemmed from KUDARK. It was his impression that our conversations of last November and December and the remedial action taken by CFC at that time relative to the USEP German unit's handling of the Soviet program had indicated his willing-ness to do anything possible to correct deficiencies and to forestall just such criticism. In paragraph 1 of the reference we indicated that satisfactory answers to our questions had been received. In this connection we enclose as Attachment A a copy of Brown's written answers to our specific questions. (Attachment B is a criteria for USEP Assistance.)

2.  In regard to the criticism leveled at Brown and the German unit by the Commanist Kolo office, the following pertinent excerpts were passed to the undersigned:

> "At the third meeting a great deal of stress was laid on the question of the special interest cases of other Government agencies. I was able to dwell at some length on the special handling that we have given special interest cases, and to cite chapter and verse of our report to the OPD. Nonetheless,

It was felt that we should very greatly intensify our efforts in this respect. It is clearly considered that the disposal of special interest cases on a very high priority basis warrants unusual effort, procedures, and expense on the part of the Program. Both Army and (KUDARK) attach very great importance to this, and deep dissatisfaction was expressed with the manner in which the present procedures are being implemented by the Program. In Germany, specifically, it was felt that the Program has been reluctant to associate itself or its contractors with cases which present apparent insuperable difficulties in connection with the cases."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

voluntary agencies, the Program should find other means through other contractors, or through its own offices, of arranging disposal on a *top priori* basis. I would suggest that the Program was better geared to such an effort than any other U.S. Government program, and that one of its most important yardsticks of its effectiveness must be its capacity to handle this type of case. In brief, should we comprehend that we have perhaps been inelastic in our approach to this problem and predisposed to keep a simon-pure operation at all costs.

"I want to point out one point. ...two or three OCB meetings..." Two members other

Washington recently, there has been severe criticism of the manner in which eligibility criteria are being applied by the German country unit. Criticism has been received on three occasions from (WHCAM?), and is also included in the State Department report to the OCB Group. The charge is made that the German country unit has been unnecessarily legalistic, has adopted overly restrictive manners, and was hypertechnical. The statement was made that in the OCB meeting that the all-important Soviet escapees, cases had been turned down for the grounds of voluntary repatriation. Though the escapees never got near Berlin. The statement was also made that more than Soviets, only diplomatic and military defectees had been granted eligibility."

3. We are assured by Brown and other responsible officials that the final charge made above relating to diplomatic and military defectees is entirely erroneous and this information is borne out by our own investigation. In the past, eligibility was withheld from certain *voluntary repatriates* who had in fact, not no further than Berlin on the trek back to the USSR who later returned to West Germany. However, we are assured that this is no longer necessarily true and that each case is judged individually.

4. Finally, the German Mission feels that remains flat statement that any or all assistance can be rendered to any escapee without regard to past disqualification, provided KUBAIK will designate them to receive such assistance, is evidence of his and his units desire to cooperate wholeheartedly. We wish to assure Headquarters that the field is now of the opinion that USREP is making a sincere and energetic effort to carry out a most difficult task. We have no complaints at the present time as to the handling of that part of the program which touches KUBAIK interests. It will be appreciated if this can be made clear by the KUBAIK official responsible for liaison with the Escapen Program in Washington.

However, EPD Germany has advised OFC that a form has been devised to determine this information and that this form was presented to the agencies, for their use, on December 7. They have been asked to report on all persons assisted.

(b) Question: What, if any, project exists to relieve TB incidence among this group?

Supplemental aid is primarily designed to help escapees maintain or recover their health. All agencies know that evidence of poor health, supported by advice of a doctor, authorizes special food supplements. USEP funds can and have been used to provide better living conditions also. The Tolstoy Foundation and AFRF have spent $7,550.45 on supplemental food, including additional food at the three special installations. No figures are available as to the exact number of 23 Soviet escapees who have been assisted.

(c) Question: How many people have received jobs through the efforts of the agencies?

(1) Through the Kaiserslautern project, 40 Soviet escapees have been placed in jobs and private housing found for 17 of this number.

(2) During the recent review of agency cases, about 50 Soviet escapees proved to be employed. In some cases, agency participation was apparent; in others, not. The degree of agency aid in finding these jobs would be difficult to pinpoint.

(3) There is also evidence that 20 to 30 escapees have enlisted in Labor Service Companies as "other nationalities". Here again, agency participation is difficult to determine.

(d) Question: How many have been emigrated through efforts of the agencies?

According to the October reports, the Tolstoy Foundation has obtained 94 visas for escapees, in addition to 432 visas under Section 3(c) of the DP Act. For the rest of the fiscal year they estimate that they will obtain 118 more 3(c) visas and 53 others. APRF, which has just started resettlement activities, expects to obtain 15 visas under Section 3(c) and 15 others.

(e) Question: Is there any vocational training or other educational program?

(1) There are three vocational training schools available for escapees, with unused space in all three, at Munich, Ingolstadt and Berlin. Training-expenses-plus complete care and maintenance are paid for ...

for by the German Government and USEP. The Harlafeli project, will, hopefully, attack the problem causing poor attendance, namely lack of interest and poor accial adjustment.

(2) The World's YMCA conducte language training in Valka and Karlsfold. Other classes were discontinued due to lack of attendance, but a campaign is now in pro,ress to rebuild the pronten.

(f) Questions What housing projects have been projected?

No further housing projects are contemplated untila

(1) The egency counsellors visit each family and definitely deter- mine the problems facing them, and

(2) The present 126 to 146 spaces are effectively utilized.

13. Cuentions What are future plans for the items listed in paragraph 127

The fundamental shortcoming in the USEP program to assist Soviet escapoos is the fact that the counselling progres has not been completed. Once this has boen done, EPD Germany and the voluntary agencies together will dovolop a comprehensivo prograå for nesting all of the needs of the Soviet group. This plan will undoubtedly include *inter alias*

1. Development, improvement and ccapletion of the projects now in operation.

2. Increased supplemental and as families are visited and their noods determined. Cleso supervision will be exercised to ensure that the agencies relate this aid to the solution of the families' problems, including health difficulties and housing.

3. All ouCapoes will to registered for enigration, the employ. ablos caong then will be trada-touted, and arrangements will be made to ensure that the propor vocational training is available to those requiring it. In addition, assistance will be bxtended in clearing up logai problems faced by sscapees which might bar thes from resettloment. The agoncios will be required to subuit special reporte on their activities.

4. Spacial efforts are being made to revitalise the vocational training and la guage training programs. Past experience indicates that success in this ondeavor will be limited. Eowever, it is hoped that offective individual counselling will eventually induce the oscapees to take proper training.

ORT Union, the World YMCA, and the Lutheran World Federation. With- out exception, these agencies have strong and reputable American affiliates which are accredited and recognised by the Advisory Com- mittee on Voluntary Foreign Aid. In the case of WCC, the American affiliate is the National Council of the Churches of Christ, whose welfare organization is the Church World Services is is accredited by the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid and is a member in good standing of the (American Council of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service, Incorporated. The specific requirements for quali- fication are not now available; however, it is believed that to be qualified for accreditation by the Advisory Committee, an agency must be supported by voluntary subscriptions, and humanitarian in character. It is believed that agencies wholly political are not eligible.

9. Question: What is the status of the proposal to form a Russian labor company which we understand has been approved in Washington?

General agreement on the formation by USAREUR of a Labor Service Unit comprised of Soviet escapees has been reached by US EUCOM and USAREUR. This project now only awaits final approval from the Depart- ment of Army as to certain details. (It is understood that the Army has already agreed to the proposal in principal.) It is anticipated that the project will be implemented in the near future.

The Unit, which will be assigned a guard mission, will comprise initially 100 officers and men. In addition, one man to act as staff advisor to USAREUR on matters affecting the Unit will probably be recruited. This position should have a field grade of perhaps a Lieutenant Colonel. The personnel ceiling of 100 may be raised to 200 should it appear desirable in the light of experience. In order to avoid the appearance of supporting Great Russian or minority national aspirations, the shoulder flash for members of the company would bear the name "ROSSISKIY" or Russian People, rather than "RUSSKIY" or Russians.

In the course of a recent discussion between representatives of CAS, U.S. EUCOM, and this office concerning this proposal, general agreement was reached on the following points:

a) Leadership in the company should be recruited from the more recent Soviet escapees or defectors, rather than from the older "emigre" groups.

b) Efforts should be made to recruit the maximum possible number from the escapees registered with USEP, and

c) The TZOPE group should be strongly represented in the company.

10. Questions...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 48

# SECRET

10. Question: Have any steps been taken to get the Clemency Board of HICOG to pardon Soviet escapee's sentenced for minor offenses committed in an attempt to survive, thus clearing their records? Do you want us to make any pitch on this?

In the past, petitions for clemency have only been presented to the Clemency Board of HICOG when a person was under active consideration for resettlement. The Clemency Board has usually acted swiftly with the best interest of the individual and of the J.S. Government in mind. Recently, however, steps were taken to initiate petitions for clemency on all cases of the types mentioned in Question 10. It is too early at the present time to foresee the result of this operation. However, it is believed that it is not yet necessary for CAS to approach the appropriate officials on this point.

11. Question: Is the USEP policy to reduce the numbers who can be helped under the Program? If true, what are the reasons for this policy which appears on the surface to be a step backward from solving the problem?

It is not the USEP policy to reduce the numbers who can be helped under the Escapee Program. As a matter of fact, the USEP caseload has continued to increase despite the fact that over 6,000 have been resettled, and many have been dropped for various reasons, including ineligibility, local integration, and death. It is true that the primary purpose of the Program is to resettle eligibles abroad, and to integrate locally those whose resettlement potential is low. This action, of and in itself, does tend to reduce the number of persons who can be subsequently helped under the Program. It is also the policy of the Program to create an atmosphere in which other programs which depend to a certain extent upon the psychological attitude existing in emigre circles can operate successfully. In furthering this particular objective, the Program has recently taken action to declare as eligible those persons who, although having records as minor criminals, are of interest to U.S. agencies, and have broadened the basis to accept any Soviet citizen as eligible if he has in any way been under discipline of the Soviet Government since January 1, 1945.

12. Question: What has the Escapee Program accomplished for Soviet escapees?

USEP's assistance to escapees is based primarily upon the needs of each individual registered with the Program. These needs are determined through a counselling program under which the voluntary agencies cooperating with USEP are supposed to send case workers to the field to interview each escapee family to determine their particular needs, background, problems, experience, ambitions, and general situation. Based upon this interview the agency is supposed to develop a specific plan ...

10.5 perations Mission for Germany has contracts with both
Po..ty Foundation and AFRP to carry out a counselling program for
Soviet ..capeos, and has spent approximately $11,000 on each agency
in this connection, to date the agencies have not completely counselled
... their cassionde. Accordingly, it is most difficult to make any
Bind of analysis of the amount of assistance rendered as compared to the
extent of need. On Decoubor 7, representatives of both agoncios voго
advised by the Kacapoo Program Division, that the counselling progran
aust to completed in the near future, and that USEP will be in a much
better position to evaluate the program of assistance to Soviet escapoes.

Despite the admittedly unsatisfactory situation outlined in the
previous paragraph, certain positive action has been taken by the EPD
and the voluntary agencies to provide assistance to Soviet oссареов.
Reportedly, AFRP has distributed in the neighborhood of 813,000 in
supplemental assistance in the form of food, clothing, lodging, ०१०.,
to cacajeea rogistored in their oncoload. The Tolstoy Foundation has
distributed in the neighborhood of fly,000. In addition, threo special
housing aid projecto have been established in Germany the Friendship
House in Munich with a capacity of 10 peracne, and the conter in
Kaiserslautern, with a capacity of 36 -- both sponsored by AFR?, and
the Toistoy hose in Karlofeld which has a capacity of 60 to 100. A

The Friendship House in Munich is saall and is always full. The
longth of otay varios por individual as ita primary purpose is to fur
nich topporary housing for Russian escapees who come to Lunich looking
for work. In cows cause these periods of residence have dragged out.
At this home full caro and caintenance is given, as the residents are
coatly ineligible for rollof grants in Bavaria.

All these people, plus other dependents, passed through the center or were aided by the agency facilities there. (Dependents moved to Kaiserslautern only after private quarters were located.) Of the total, at least forty-three persons had, at one time or another, lived in the house. It must be emphasised that this installation is not regarded as permanent housing but was erected solely to house escapees temporarily for whom jobs had been found and who needed quarters until they could locate permanent billets. Therefore, escapees are referred here only when job opportunities exist and stay only until private housing is located. At one time, consideration was given to filling the house with employment potentials, but the agency demurred for fear the project would be ruined by insoluable morale problems and by the lack of available space to meet quickly employment requirements.

To summarize on the question of "housing projects", and apart from housing in the German economy, installations for special purposes are considered and these three subsidized: (1) the benefits derived from the Friendship House in Munich are being evaluated, and will be discussed at the forthcoming conferences; (2) the Karlufold House has recently been opened and filling it is being delayed by a rather cumbersome screening process, but a process required to meet our security requirements and the requirements of the Munich Consulate Generals; and (3) the Kaiserslautern House has been rather effectively used, being limited by the numbers of job opportunities. Until we are convinced, however, that full or almost full benefits are being derived from these houses, USEP is reluctant to establish additional housing projects of a temporary nature and it is contrary to USEP policy to enter into long-term arrangements which would be entailed in provision of permanent housing.

Further, escapees generally are eligible for housing within the German economy. A search for this housing is made among that controlled by the Wohnungeant or is earmarked in new refugee housing being built. Escapees are being included in a new FOA program of $15 million which is currently being discussed by FOA and the German Federal Republic (see DEPTEL to Bonn USYOTO 453, December 15, 1953.).

Additionally, 50 Soviet children were sent to Switzerland for rehabilitation and a vacation for eight weeks last summer at a cost of $3,907.

(a) Question: How many ex-Soviets have received what assistance and how much for Care & Maintenance?

As pointed out above, the incomplete and unsatisfactory status of the counselling projects of the agencies, plus inadequate or unavailable files, preclude the possibilities of determining how many Soviets have received that assistance and how much for Care & Maintenance.

Text of January 9, 1955, cable. (Confidential)

"Local Units are advised that effective inned Soviet defectors who escaped since Jan 1, 1945 may be considered eligible for complete program assistance. Units shld complete registration of this group in each area and advise OFC of numbers registered. Every effort shld be made to create maximum program impact on Sov escapees in each area. It is realized that extension of eligibility to this group may cause some repercussion among other nationality groups and the agencies supporting them. It is pointed out however that great majority Sov defectors are eligible under provisions para 6 & 7 of Provisional Guide #1. Moreover Units shld take all feasible measures to minimize repercussions by exercising utmost discretion in implementation of this instruction e.g. by discussing it primarily only with agencies interested in this group."

"Soviet defectors referred to in Frankfurt tel sent Vienna 83, Rome 87, Athens 102, Trieste 39, Istanbul 43, Geneva 21 for Carson chld be generally interpreted as those Sov citizens or Sov Ukranians who left Military or Govt service since Jan 1945, or their dependents (para 6 of Prov Guide #1). Local Units may also extend assistance to such other post Jan 1945 Sov escapees who qualify under Para 7 of Guide #1, excepting hard core DP's or persons who have been in refugee status prior to World War II."

Text of instructions issued to all field units December 1953:

"Regardless of his country of origin, any Iron Curtain escapee who, during the period 1945 to the present time, was voluntarily or forcibly repatriated, but who proceeded no further than the Eastern Zones of Germany or Austria, and was detained in the Eastern Zones of Germany or Austria under the discipline of the Soviet occupation forces or was employed in an official, semi-official, or any other capacity, regardless of the nature of his employment, by or for the Soviet occupation forces, and who subsequently defected, fled, escaped, or otherwise returned to the West, for any reason, should be considered eligible for USEP assistance, provided he is otherwise eligible."

Your attention is again directed to Section 7 of Guide 1 which authorises you to make exceptions in any individual case, regardless of eligibility criteria.

1. Question: Does USEP plan to exort tighter and constant management control over this project, as against the present system of hands-off until end-audity or is this impossible because of regulations? If the latter is true, who has the power to change the regulations, and is it possible for them to be changed within the context of overall USEP policy?

Short of involving itself or its staff in the actual implementa- tion of projects or in voluntary agency operations, USEP maintains a continuing scrutiny and review of every project and contract into which It has entered. Information developed by field officere in the course of this review is passed to the Chief of the Escapee Program Division concerned, who evaluates the material and discusses it, when appropri- ate, with the local agency director. Subsequent to this evaluation and discussion with the agency, the material is forwarded to OFCEP which cakes a second analysis and, if indicated, discusses it with the agancy's European Director. There is no policy of hands-off until the end-audit is made. End-use-audits are an integral part of the review of projects in order to determine whether or not the supplies and services are reaching the escapees.

In the light of the preceding paragraph, the latter part of the question becomes academics however, USEP policy in this respect is flexible and can be adapted to any situation warranting a modification of proceduree.

2. Question: What is the interpretation of "local settioment"? If a man is earning a distinctly submarginal existence, which means an unhealthy and unhappy existence, is he automatically ruled out? Who caile the shots on this, USEP or the agencies?

Local settlement is not predicated solely on economic factors. Rather, local settiomen: doponds upon a variety of conditions obtaining in the case of a particular family. Consideration quet, of neces- sity, be given to the jobs of the principal wago-carners to deteraino whother or not they are working in an occupational area most suitablo to their desires, background and ability; to their wages to deteraine whether or not their earnings are sufficient to moot the needs of their familys to their housing to determine if it is adequate, and other fac- tore which must be considered in connection with a family's fira inte- gration into the local community, including its own attitude toward such integration. It is not the policy of USEP to place a man or a rezily on an ineligible or inactive list as a locally settled case if ho to earning a distinctly submarginal existence. The decision of local settlement is made by the Chief of the Escapee Program Division concerned and only after a careful analysis of the situation obtaining in each particular casa. Usually the Division Chief's decision is dased upon the recommendation of the voluntary agency as analyzed and evaluated by USEP officere in the field.

3. Question: What is planned to eliminate the duplication in caseload of the two agencies?

Duplication in caseload between the various voluntary agencies participating in the Escapee Program has been oliminated to an approviable extent. It has existed principally in the cage of two agencies in Germany dealing with the Soviet problem --Tolstoy Foundation and American Friends Dr Russian Freedea. This, however, was resolved on December 7, 1953 at a meeting of the two agoncios with the Chie. Kacapoo Prograa Division/USC at this mooting the Tolotcy Foundation was given principal responsibility for all cases which havo a resectio-cont potential. AFRF was given all casos which had limited or no resettlement potential and cust, of necessity, bo sottled locally ta the Corman .concay. The supplementary care and maintenance was dividad arter a thorough discussion with each agency by mutual agreement. This action resulted in establishing a cavalond in Germany of 79 cases consisting of some 100 peuple for TF, and 102 cases with approximately 200 people for AYRF. Now registranto by withor agency will be reforred to Escapos Program field representatives (in Germany, Munich) for a chock against current card files. After a dossior has been fully developed on the case, a determination as to the appropriate agency vill de cado according to the case's recetticment potential.

4. Question: What are the criteria for accepting a Soviet escape as a relief recipient and what office or regulations determine swe?

Thore is enclosed the basic provisional guide concerning eligibility, together with subsequent clarifications issued to the field on the Sovieto. This is the criteria under which a person is ostended, and declared eligible for, Progran assistance. Thoes regulations veто adapted frea, a general policy issued by the U.S. Department of Stato.

The Escape Program was originally outlined in CEPCIRTEL 676, January 29, 1952 (Top Secret) which indicated that the Program would be undertaken through contracts with voluntary agencies to provide certain supplies and services to escapees of recent date. Inasmuch as the largest and most important voluntary agencies operating in Europe are of religious nature and endeavor to stay clear of undertakings which have political implications, it was determined that the Escape Program would suppress to the extent possible the political nature of its operations in order to secure and maintain the "good will" and cooperation of those agencies. In our relationships, however, with certain agencies of ethnic character (e.g. AFCR - American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees), especially when these agencies are directed by individuals in whom USEP has complete confidence, little, if any, action has been taken to suppress or disguise USEP political implications. There is, however, a tendency on the part of USEP officials to suppress political implications of the Program in their arrangements with several agencies -- due to their lack of confidence in the leadership of those agencies. Mrs. Schaufuso, Tolstoy Foundation, Sheba Goodman, American Friends of Russian Freedon, Max Braude, Organization for Rehabilitation through Training, Anna Matson, International Rescue Committee; and Michael Rodyk, United Ukrainian American Relief Committee; are examples of Directors in whom USEP has little confidence. This lack of confidence arises from the fact that those personalities apparently have their own axes to grind. USEP has revealed, however, and will continue to reveal to a limited extent, the political nature of the Escapes Program to certain selected persons in the voluntary agencies who are subject to the necessary degree of direction, and in whom confidence may be maintained. This course of action to motivated primarily by the fact that political overtones of the Program cannot be wholly hidden from an intelligent person, yet it is not in the Program's best interest to advise officially the religious bodies of the political aspects. Although the major religious agencies undoubtedly are aware of the political aspects of the Program, they choose to ignore them so long as they are not involved directly into any political operations, and so long as they are not advised officially of them.

6. Citation: Are there any means through which assistance to deserving members of ZOPE (already on the caseload) can be speeded up?

USEP officials throughout the area are continually endeavoring to speed up Program benefits to the ultimate recipients. This is applicable to the entire caseload of all agencies and has not in the past been predicated upon membership in any organization which may or may not be of interest to U.S. Government agencies. In this way, USEP endeavors to extend Program benefits to all those eligible without focusing unnecessary attention upon individual members of a particular organization of interest to agencies of the U.S. Government. Further, USEP officials ...

officials have no way of determining whether an escapee is or is not a master of TCOPS. However, if CAU desires to furnish USEP with a list of TCOPS membership, OFC will request the USEP Divisions in each country to confer eligibility on the individuals listed and to pay particular attention that such individuals may receive personal attention in the future.

7. Question: Is there any possibility of eliminating Tolstoy and AFRF altogether and doing this job through another agency or agencies?

In consideration of this question, USEP has reluctantly decided that it would not be possible to eliminate Tolstoy Foundation, since Tolstoy is an old, established agency with a name known and respected within certain emigre circles. It may be possible, however, for CAS to undertake the elimination, although CAS relationships with TP and its Board of Directors are unknown to this office. Since AFRF is a relatively new organization, and the character of its European leadership is much more undesirable than that of Tolstoy, it is conceivable that AFRF could be eliminated from the Russian field considerably easier than Tolstoy. Moreover, as the Chairman of the Board of the AFRF is a retired U.S. Admiral, he would probably be inclined to go along with the wishes of Government officials if it could be shown that the elimination of AFRF was in the best interest of the U.S. Government. However, the elimination of ethnic type agencies in this respect would, perhaps, compel the Escapee Program to enter into relationships with a religious agency, e.g. the WCC, in their stead and the successful resolution of the Soviet problem would become automatically much more difficult.

8. Question: How does an agency qualify for a USEP contract? What are the requirements for qualification?

USEP currently has contractual arrangements with 22 voluntary societies representing the major religious bodies (i.e. Catholics, Jews, and Protestants) and the major ethnic groups represented in the population of the United States of America. To qualify for a USEP contract the agency, if it is wholly American in composition and incorporated under the laws of one of the 48 States, or the District of Columbia, must be accredited by what was known as the Department of State's Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid, and which is now a part of FOA. The Executive Director of this Committee is Mr. William H. McCahon, who is also a staff member in the Office of the Assistant Director for Refugees and Migration, FOA. In addition to those agencies which have been incorporated in the U.S., USEP also enters into relationships with other organisations which are international in character and composition- such as the World Council of Churches, the World

1.  The Mutual Security Act of 1951 provides the basic legislativo authority for the Escapco Fregran and thus establishes the elementary criteria fer extending assistance.

Section 101 (a)(1) of that Act authorizes the expenditure of a sua not to axceed $100,000,000 "for any selected persons who are residing in er escaphos from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonin, er the Communist dominated or Comunist occupied areas of Cormany and Austria, and any other countries absorbed by the Soviet Union either to fom such persons into olarents e the military forces supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or for other purposes, when it is similarly dotermined by the tresidont that such assistance will contribute to the corease of the North Atlantic area and to the security of the United States!".

2.  Officials carrying out this program she old not become involved in complex, time-consuming procedures in dotermining priority for assistance. It is expected that a positive approach toward priority will be taken and that criteria will insan a simple and broad as is consistent with U.S. interests. It follows that and should be given inmediately to persons who apparently meet the pri Pity criteria outlined celom and should be withdrawn only if reasonablo evidence is brought forward which indicates that the person does not meet these criteria,

3.  The intent and purpose of the program is to aid new escapces fro communist oppression. Whatever the merits of aiding persons who wore displaced before, during, or soon after World War II, such aid is not normally a proper concern of this program. Hcreover, quite apart from any other considerations, the program does not have sufficient funds to assist many parsans other than those who have recenti escajed from benind the Iron Curtain. In the foregoing perspective, the following criteria will be utilized by the luissans in according priority for assistance.

4.  Friority for assistance in resettlement and for supplementary care will bo granted any person who escapod after Junuary 1, 1940 from the WSR, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Runania, Bulgaria or Albania.

5.  within the bread sonfines of the above, there will be certain persons whos the United States cbviowly will not desire to assist and there will to others whose status in their country of residence after flight is such that they possess the rights and obligations of nationality of tho country in mich they have taken asylwi.

CI: Eaton, the World N, and the Lutheran World Federation. Without exception, these agencies have strong and reputable American affiliates which are accredited and recognised by the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid. In the case of VCC, the American affiliate is the National Council of the Churches of Christ, whose welfare organisation is the Church World Service; it is accredited by the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid and is a member in good standing of the American Council of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service, Incorporated. The specific requirements for qualification are not now available; however, it is believed that to do qualified for accreditation by the Advisory Committee, an agency must be supported by voluntary subscriptions, and humanitarian in character. It is believed that agencies wholly political are not eligible.

9. Question: What is the status of the proposal to form a Russian Labor company which we understand has been approved in Washington?

General agreement on the formation by USARSUR of a Labor Service Cal: comprised of Soviet escapees has been reached by US BUCOM and USARSUR. This project now only awaits final approval from the Department of Army as to certain details. (It is understood that the Army has already agreed to the proposal in principal.) It is anticipated that the project will be implemented in the near future.

The Unit, which will be assigned a guard mission, will comprise initially 100 officers and men. In addition, one man to act as staff advisor to USAREUR on matters affecting the Unit will probably be recruited. This position should have a field grade of perhaps a Lieutenant Colonel. The personnel ceiling of 100 may be raised to 200 should it appear desirable in the light of experience. In order to avoid the appearance of supporting Great Russian or minority national aspirations, the shoulder flash for members of the company would bear the name "ROSSISKIY" or Russian People, rather than "RUSSKIY" or Russians.

In the course of a recent discussion between representatives of CAS, U.S. BUCOM, and this office concerning this proposal, general agreement was reached on the following points:

a) Leadership in the company should be recruited from the more recent Soviet escapees or defectors, rather than from the older "émigré" group;

b) Efforts should be made to recruit the maximum possible number from the escapees registered with USSP; and

c) The TZOPE group should be strongly represented in the company.

10. Question ...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

# SECRET

10. Question: Have any steps been taken to get the Clemency Board of HICOG to pardon Soviet escapees sentenced for minor offenses committed in an attempt to survive, thus clearing their records? Do you want us to make any pitch on this?

In the past, petitions for clemency have only been presented to the Clemency Board of HICOG when a person was under active consideration for resettlement. The Clemency Board has usually acted swiftly with the best interest of the individual and of the U.S. Government in mind. Recently, however, steps were taken to initiate petitions for clemency on all cases of the types mentioned in Question 10. It is too early at the present time to foresee the result of this operation. However, it is believed that it is not yet necessary for CAS to approach the appropriate officials on this point.

11. Question: Is the USEP policy to reduce the numbers who can be helped under the Program? If true, what are the reasons for this policy which appears on the surface to be a step backward from solving the problem?

It is not the USEP policy to reduce the numbers who can be helped under the Escapee Program. As a matter of fact, the USEP caseload has continued to increase despite the fact that over 6,000 have been resettled, and many have been dropped for various reasons, including ineligibility, local integration, and death. It is true that the primary purpose of the Program is to resettle eligibles abroad, and to integrate locally those whose resettlement potential is low. This action, of and in itself, does tend to reduce the number of persons who can be subsequently helped under the Program. It is also the policy of the Program to create an atmosphere in which other programs which depend to a certain extent upon the psychological attitude existing in émigré circles can operate successfully. In furthering this particular objective, the Program has recently taken action to declare as eligible those persons who, although having records as minor criminals, are of interest to U.S. agencies, and have broadened the basis to accept any Soviet citizen as eligible if he has in any way been under discipline of the Soviet Government since January 1, 1945.

12. Question: What has the Escapee Program accomplished for Soviet escapees?

USEP's assistance to escapees is based primarily upon the needs of each individual registered with the Program. Those needs are determined through a counseling program under which the voluntary agencies cooperating with USEP are supposed to send case workers to the field to interview each escapee family to determine their particular needs, background, problems, experience, ambitions, and general situation. Based upon this interview the agency is supposed to develop a specific plan ...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

Plan of assistance for the family with the basic objective being their eventual resettlement in a country of immigration or, if this is not possible, re-establishment within the economy of their present country of residence. Although the Escapee Program Division of the U.S. Operations Mission for Germany has contracts with both Tolstoy Foundation and APRP to carry out a counselling program for Soviet escapees, and has spent approximately $14,000 on each agency in this connection, to date the agencies have not completely counselled all of their cases. Accordingly, it is most difficult to make any kind of analysis of the amount of assistance rendered as compared to the extent of need. On December 7, representatives of both agencies were advised by the Escapee Program Division, that the counselling program must be completed in the near future, and that USEP will be in a much better position to evaluate the program of assistance to Soviet escapees.

Despite the admittedly unsatisfactory situation outlined in the previous paragraph, certain positive action has been taken by the EPD and the voluntary agencies to provide assistance to Soviet escapees. Reportedly, AFRP has distributed in the neighborhood of $15,000 in supplemental assistance in the form of food, clothing, lodging, etc., to escapees registered in their caseload. The Tolstoy Foundation has distributed in the neighborhood of $19,000. In addition, three special housing aid projects have been established in Germany: the Friendship House in Munich with a capacity of 10 persons, and the center in Kaiserslautern, with a capacity of 36 -- both sponsored by APRP, and the Tolstoy home in Karlefeld which has a capacity of 80 to 100.

The Friendship House in Munich is small and is always full. The length of stay varies per individual as its primary purpose is to furnish temporary housing for Russian escapees who come to Munich looking for work. In some cases these periods of residence have dragged out. At this home full care and maintenance is given, as the residents are mostly ineligible for relief grants in Bavaria.

- The Karlofeld house was opened on September 4 and has accepted 26 escapees to date. In addition to the fact that each applicant is screened by the agency and then by a consulate and USEP representative, the admission process is complicated by the need to transfer unemployed and relief benefits from other areas. While this installation is not meant to be a housing project of semi-permanent quarters, the type of aid needed by most persons selected will probably result in a fairly stable population, once the house is filled. The Kaiserslautern home reported, as of November 15:

19 current residents
11 persons moved to private quarters
3 persons moved to Labor Service Units
10 persons returned to former residence
5 dependents placed in jobs
48

All these people, plus other dependents, passed through the center or wore act as the agency facilities there. (Dependents rated to Kaiserslautern only after private quarters were located.) Of the total, at least forty-three persons had, at one time or another, lived in the house. It must be emphasized that this installation is not regarded as permanent housing but was erected solely to house escapees temporarily for whom jobs had been found and who needed quarters until they could locate permanent billets. Therefore, escapees are referred here only when job opportunities exist and stay only until private housing is located. At one time, consideration was given to filling the house with employment potentials, but the agency demurred for fear the project would be ruined by insoluahle morale problems and by the lack of avail-able space to meet quickly employment requirements.

To summarize on the question of "housing projects", and apart from housing in the German economy, installations for special purposes were considered and those three subsidized: (1) the benefits derived from the Friendship House in Munich are being evaluated, and will be dis-cussed at the forthcoming conference; (2) the Karlsfeld House has recently been opened and filling it is doing delayed by a rather cumber-some screening process, but a process required to meet our security requirements and the requirements of the Munich Consulate General, and (3) the Leitershofen House has been rather effectively used, being limited by the numbers of job opportunities. Until we are convinced, however, that full or almost full benefits are being derived from these homes, EIP is reluctant to establish additional housing projects of a temporary nature and it is contrary to USEP policy to enter into long-term arrangements which would be entailed in provision of permanent housing.

Further, escapees generally are eligible for housing within the German economy. A search for this housing is made among that control-led by the Wohnungsamt or is earmarked in new refugee housing being built. Escapees are being included in a new FOA program of $15 million which is currently being discussed by FOA and the German Federal Republic (see DEPTEL to Bonn USFOTO 453, December 15, 1953.).

Additionally, 30 Soviet children were sent to Switzerland for rehabilitation and a vacation for eight weeks last summer at a cost of $3,987.

(a) *Question:* How many ex-Soviets have received what assistance and how much for Care & Maintenance?

As pointed out above, the incomplete and unsatisfactory status of the counselling projects of the agencies, plus inadequate or unavail-able files, preclude the possibilities of determining how many Soviets have received what assistance and how much for Care & Maintenance.

SUBJECT: GENERAL - REDSOX/AEPA

SPECIFIC: Assistance to Soviet Escapees Through USFP

RE: ECA-30972

DISPATCH NO. EGOA-36400

ROUTING

1.  In a recent conversation with Mr. Richard R. Brown, OFCEP, Frankfurt, he read several portions of a letter which he had just received from his Washington headquarters directing some fairly strong criticism to the German country unit in its handling of the program. Needless to say, Brown was considerably upset since it appears that much of the criticism stemmed from KUBARK. It was his impression that our conversations of last November and December and the remedial action taken by OFC at that time relative to the USEP German unit's handling of the Soviet program had indicated his willingness to do anything possible to correct deficiencies and to forestall just such criticism. In paragraph 1 of the reference we indicated that satisfactory answers to our questions had been received. In this connection we enclose as Attachment A a copy of Brown's written answers to our specific questions. (Attachment B is a criteria for USFP assistance.)

2.  In regard to the criticism levelled at Brown and the German unit by the Comarea here office, the following pertinent excerpts were passed to the understmode:

> "At the third meeting a great deal of stress was laid on the question of the special interest cases of other Government agencies. I was able to dwell at some length on the special handling that we have given special interest cases, and to cite chapter and verse of our report to the OFC. Nonetheless, it was felt that we should very greatly intensify our efforts in this respect. It is clearly considered that the disposal of special interest cases on a very high priority basis warrants unusual effort, procedures, and expense on the part of the Program. Dot Army and (KUBARK) attach very great importance to this, and so dissatisfaction was expressed with the manner in which the present procedures are being implemented by the Program. In Germany, specifically, it was felt that the Program has been reluctant to associate 'tools' or its contractors with cases which might present insuperable difficulties in connection with the

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

RCA 36100

voluntary agencies, the Program should find other means through other contractors, or through its own officers, of arranging dispersal on a top priority basis. It was felt that the Program was better conred to such an effort than any other U.S. Government program, and that one of the most important yard-sticks of its effectiveness must be its capacity to handle this matter in other eligibility criteria now being applied by the agencies. In brief, it is thought was unprec that the Program would perhaps been inelastic in our approach to this problem and pre-disposed to keep a situation at all costs.

"I want to bring out one more point..." At three of the three OCD meetings and from numerous other Washington recently, there have been severe criticism of the manner in which eligibility criteria are being applied by the German country unit. Criticism has been received on three occasions from (KUBARK), and is also included in the State Department report to the OCD group. The change is made that the German country unit has been unnecessarily realistic', and has adopted overly restrictive measures, and has been hyper-technical. The statement was made in the OCD meeting that the all-important Soviet escapees, cases had been turned from the grounds of voluntary repatriation even though the escapees had never past Berlin. The statement was also made that the Soviets, only diplomatic and military defectors had been granted eligibility."

3. We are assured by Brown and other USSC officials that the final charge made above relating to diplomatic and military defectors is entirely erroneous and this refutation is borne out by our own investigation. In the past, eligibility was withheld from certain "voluntary repatriates" who had in fact, got no further than Berlin on the trek back to the USSR and who later returned to West Germany. However, we are assured that this is no longer necessarily true and that each case is judged individually.

4. Finally, the German Mission feels that Brown's flat statement that any or all assistance can be rendered to any escapee without regard to past disqualification, provided KUBARK will designate them to receive such assistance, is evidence of his and his unit's wish to cooperate wholeheartedly. We wish to assure Headquarters that the field is now of the opinion that USSC is making a sincere and energetic effort to carry out a most difficult task. We have no com-plaints at the present time as to the handling of that part of the program which touches KUBARK interests. It will be appreciated if this can be made clear by the KUBARK official responsible for liaison with the Escapon Program in Washington.

## CRITERIA FOR FRIORITY ASSISTANCE JIDER ESCAPES PROGRAM

1.  The Lutut Security Act of 1951 provides the basic legislative authority for the Escapes Irogram and thus establishes the elementary criteria fer extending assistance.

Section 101 (a)(1) cứ thịt Act cuthorizes the expenditure of a sua not to accocd $100,000,000 "for any colected portens who are residing in or cscapacs froa the Soviet Unica, Foland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, imania, Bulgaria, Albania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, or the Communist dominatol er Commist occupied areas of Gorzany and Austria, and any other countries absorbed by the Soviet Union either to fola cuch persons into cleants of the cilitary forces supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or for other purposes, when it is similarly coterained by the President that such assistanco will.contributo to the defense of the Horth Atlantic crea and to the security of the United States".

2.  Officials carrying out this program should not becas involved in complex, time-consuming procedures in dotermining priority for assistance. It is expoctol that a positive approach toward priority will be taken and that criteria will remain as simple and breed as is consistent with U.S. intorests. It follows that aid should be given irmodiately to wrong who epparently acot the priority critoria outlined telas and should be withdrawm only if reasonablo ovidonco is brought forward which indicates that tho person does not nest these criteria.

3.  The intent and purpose of the program is to all new escapes fro canist oppression. hatovor the worits of aiding porsons who wore din-placed before, durung, or soon after World War II, euch all is not normally a proper concern of this program. Loreover, quite apart from my other con-ellorations, tlio program does not have sufficient funds to act any parsons other than those who have recently cocard fren behind the Iron Curtain. In the foregoing perspective, the following criteria will be utilized by the Wissions in according priority for assistanco.

4.  Priority for assistance in resettlement and for supplementary care wili to granted any porson who escaped after January 1, 10 from the lisa, Polerad, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Czec.cslovakia, Hungary, Ra Bulgaria or Albininc

5.  within the trond confines of the above, thero will be certain persons whos the United States cbviously will not desire to assist and thoro will to others whose status in their country of residence after flight a such that they possess the rights and obligations of nationality of tho country in which they have takon asylwi.

## CRITERIA FOR PRIORITY ASSISTANCE UNDER ESCAPEE PROGRAM

Text of tele-conference received from Department July 14, 1952 in amplification of criteria outlined under Provisional Guide #1:

"FEP Program is concerned with escapees from Soviet or Soviet dominated areas. In view fact FEP funds are limited and because of legislative history of program priority or preference must be given to more recent escapees such as those who escaped after January 1, 1948. Decisions as to application of fund must also be based on results which can be achieved in terms of basic objectives of program. In other words we are not distributing a limited relief fund equally among a designated number of people. We are more concerned with those who have escaped more recently than those who have been in the refugee state since World War I or those who were uprooted between September 1939 and January 1, 1948. The date January 1, 1948 is an administrative device which should not to rigidly applied unless later exhaustion of funds increasingly requires this action. Of equal concern to FEP are the results which can be achieved in terms of reestablishment, resettlement, better morale, etc., as between one project and another. We should seek self-liquidating, non-repetitive uses for FEP funds. Avoid to the extent possible acceptance of responsibilities which cannot readily be relinquished. As experience develops we shall make the foregoing more selective

:Coadquarters Memorandum 7 June 63

1.  The local office of the IZNS requcated the file of
    Mrs. Chu from the oston office. This revealed the previously unr:-
    ported information that Mrs. Chu's husband died in Hong Kong in 1958
    where he had worked as Manager of the Pin Chong Food Company. The
    file further revealed that Mrs. Chu had come to the US under the aus-
    pices of the international Rescue Committee and was being sponsored
    by Manning Group of 5101 Elmcadron, Dallas, Texas.

Use: S-101937

2. Mrs. Chu was contacted at 4321 Travis Street where she
   is living with her six children. She corroborated much of the infor-
   mation contained in her IENG file and advised that she was not in
   contact with anyone on the mainland of China but occasionally heard
   from friends in Hong Kong. She is looking for work and hopes to find
   a job as a waitress or possibly a filing clerk. She stated that she
   had left the mainland in 1949 and had no recent information on condi-
   tions in Communist China. Since her potential appeared extremely
   limited, she was not questioned on the checklist guides and it is
   suggested that this case be closed.

1. WE STOVE BRIEFLY WITH HARRIS ON KOHDAY, S AFRIL. HE HAS FADE SEVERAL TRIES TO CUSA, THE LATEST IN JANUARY 1963 FOR TWO WEEKS HE VISITED FRESBYTERIAN CHURCHES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITH THE EXCEPTION O THE AREA WEST OF HAVANA. HIS OFFICIAL TITLE IS DIRECTOR, HISPANO-AMERICAN DEPARTMENT, BOARD OF NATIONAL MISSIONS (THE PRESBETRIAN SORY IN CUDA IS ADMINISTRATIVELY A FART OF THE NEW JERSEY PRESBYTERY).

HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD COMPLETE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, ENCOUNTERED NO DIFFICULTY ANYWHERE AND WAS NEVER STOPPED OR CUESTIONED BY THE AUTHORI-TIES. HE SAID HE WAS OFTEN TAKEN FOR A SOVIET OR EASTERN EUROPEAN, ΠOPARLY BECAUSE NΟ ΟΝΕ ΣΥΡECTED TO SEE AN AMERICAN.

2. HIS FLANS FOR FUTURE VISITS TO CUBA ARE A BIT INDEFINITE. HE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE NEXT VISIT WITH SEVERAL OTHER CHURCHMEN FROM OTHER DENOMINATIONS. THERE IS AN INTERDENOMINATIONAL SEMINARY AT MITANZAS, WHICH HAS MANY PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED. THE SEMIN-ARY VOULD PLAN A BOARD MEETING TO COINCIDE WITH THE VISIT OF THESE FEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE BOARD. THE GROVE THAT WOULD GO INCLUDE: Dr. STOCKWELL (METHODIST) BISHOP JOHN BENTLEY (EPISCOPAL), DE, LAPSEN CAFTIST) AND DR. JOHN SINCLAIR (PRESBYTERIAN), THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS GROUP YNOWN TO US IS BISHOP BENTLEY WHO HAS BEEN AN EXTREMELY COOFEΡΑΤΙΜE CONTACT OF THIS OFFICE. THIS TRIP HOPEFULLY WILL TAKE FLACE IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUUT THERE ARE NO DEFINITE PLANS AT THIS TIME.

3. HARRIS HAD A FROBLEM NE THOUGHT, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP WITH. THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHINCH IS TO TAKE


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 89

PLACE IN DES MOINET, IOWA FROM 15-? MAY. THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE DILECATES FROM CUBA ATTEND, BUT THEY HAVE HAD LITTLE SUCCESS IN GETTING THE NECESSARY PAPERS. THE ONLY POSSIBILITY SEEMS TO BE FOR THE DELEGATES TO GET THE SELVES TO MEXICO CITY AND TAKE A CHANCE THAT THE US EMBASSY THESE WILL GRANT THEM PERMISSION TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY. THE NAMES OF THE PROPOSED DELE ATES ARE SERGIO MANEJIAS, FACTOR OF THE CHURCH IN CARDENAS, AND HIS WIFE, PRESIDENT OF THE FRECOYTERIAN WOMEN'S

ORGANIZATION IN CARDENAS; ALSO DR. PENE CASTELLANOS, A LAYMAN FROM CARDENAS AND A FORMER UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR.

4. ON THE BASIS OF OUR RATHER SHORT VISIT WE CANNOT MAKE MUCH OF AN ASSESSMENT OF HARRIS. HE WAS EXTREMELY CORDIAL, ENTIRELY SYMPATHETIC WITH OUR INTERESTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WANTING TO BE, ASSURED THAT HIS CONTACT WITH US WOULD NOT BECOME NOUN. HE SAID THAT NATURALLY MANY PEOPLE ASSUMED HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE CIA BUT THAT IF THERE WERE ANY BASIS IN FACT FOR THIS ASSUMPTION HIS USEFULNESS WOULD BE AT AN END. THIS WOULD LEAD US TO THINK THAT HE WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING ON OUR BEHALF DURING FISTURE TRIFS TO CUDA. WE ALSO THINK, HOWEVER, THAT HE IS ENOUGH OF A REALIST THAT HE WOULD NOT BE UNDULY UPSET BY THE REQUEST AND THAT HE WOULD GIVE IT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. WHETHER HE WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE IF SOMETHING COULD BE DONE TO ENABLE THE CUBANS MENTIONED ABOVE TO COME TO DES MOINES, WE DON'T KNOW. WE THINK HE WOULD TURN DOWN ANY REQUEST TO HELP DURING HIS NEXT TRIP SINCE IT WOULD BE MADE IN THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHURCH PEOPLE.

5. WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO TALK WITH HARRIS AT GREAT LENGTH. COULD YOU GIVE US ANY IDEA OF WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE OF HELPING HIS CUBAN FRIENDS AND WE COULD THEN TRABSMIT THAT INFORMATION TO HIM AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU.

1. On 6 August 1957, Mindszenty, a representative of the International Rescue Committee, called at the office, a meeting we previously described in a memorandum cabled to the Department to study the defeatism in order to redress it into anti-Soviet sentiment. He subsequently contacted the United States with the deep financial backing for purposeful help in 1951. His visit to the United States provided backing for a put convention activity, which we and a friend developed. He also wanted to explore what activity of getting contact with OI intelligence agent with a group of possible cases of kidnapping or drumming-out to satisfy him in the person of the Soviet Union to destroy the Soviet system. Mindszenty wanted to change the scheme of the International Rescue Committee. Mindszenty was representative of IX to talk to the man. Mindszenty wanted that he not be made previous approaches to the man. The man in the office stated that he has no interest. The Embassy will then try to persuade him to become with military intelligence or hard family, which he has associates with military intelligence. The group will be available, on 16, 05, 1951, had an important exception to his ideas. The important approaches we made in November, 1950, at the time of the Hungarian revolution. The last approach was made in November, 1950, at the time of the Hungarian revolution. The Mindszenty's number formally had a pretty good illegitimate project of his. The contact in London was a Mr. Steinnger-of. Certain OI9 did not know the spelling of the man's name.

2. Cattell's strong anti-Communistic feelings result from the destruction of his family by the Soviets, as well as his intense nationalistic feelings. The astounding arrogance of his visit to the United States was contact with RJ/K-1-Academy, who has also replied. There played a terrible desire to Khrennikov in order to solicit Soviet defection. Cattell stated that he had not worked w La Borwick's assistance. Cattell was acquainted with a Corona free will for Horowitz, PAND. Cattell was a society of Soviet communism and religion had the view military against the person communism person. Therefore the meeting was a more normal thing.

I feel it is important to discuss two or three other aspects of this situation so that you will have a more correct impression of the matter and the Government's reaction to it. First, it is important to remember that the Government, particularly the P.M.A., has a substantial investment in this product. This is because the Government has assisted in financing the plant from which it is produced. Second, this is an important war product which is vital to the war effort. If the product has to be rejected, it may cause great difficulty and perhaps even result in the loss of lives. Third, the P.M.A. has given other lots of this product to our Allies. Rejection of additional quantities of this product will affect the quantities which we will be able to give them. Fourth, this situation affects morale. If the product has to be rejected, the company will be severely censured for what is already considered to be a serious violation of a contract. This will in turn affect production and make it more difficult to get a good product in the future. The situation, therefore, is rather complex and should be dealt with very carefully.

Aside from all of this, I should also like to discuss the advisability of issuing a report. It is my understanding that the company has been advised of the fact that its product is substandard and that it has already begun to take steps to rectify the situation. I also understand that the company has agreed to allow Government representatives to be present in its plant at all times to ensure that future products will be of the best possible quality. In view of this, I do not see why it is necessary to issue a report which will be detrimental to the company and which will not add anything to the current understanding of the situation. I think that in this case the best thing would be to give the company a chance to clean up its own house and to allow the Government to be present at all times to ensure that the product is satisfactory. I am confident that this is the best solution for everyone concerned and that it will ensure that the product is of the highest possible quality in the future.

1. The following information on the IRC is for background only.

2. In August 1950, Outline for Project QKGAUNT was approved for the purpose of acquiring biographic information on top-level defectors/emigres from an official of the IRC. The sum of $2,500 was to be provided by covert means. A partial payment of $1,250 was advanced on 30 August 1950 but was refused by the IRC representative, who stated he would supply as much of the information desired as possible without cost. The project was closed as of 31 August 1950.

3. In November 1950, David Martin, Executive Secretary of the IRC met with George Carey, Assistant Director for Operations, with as many as five proposals for collaboration between CIA and IRC. One proposal was for the support of a European Institute which would provide employment for displaced scientists, journalists, etc. He was informed that CIA had no funds for financing such a project.

Dear Mr. Sternberg:

As you might surmise, your organization is well known to the Agency. Following the receipt of your letter of 31 March 1976, a more definitive search for information pertaining to your request was conducted. No information was located which would indicate that CIA has ever provided funds to the IRC either directly or indirectly. I trust this letter will allay any apprehensions your organization has had in this matter.

If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.

1.  We met Charles Sternberg, Executive Director of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) on 10 May 1973. In the course of our conversation, Sternberg noted that we had shown quite a bit of interest in Soviet arrivals (defectors) recently and suggested that it would be of a great advantage to us if we were able to introduce ourselves as, for instance, representatives of a scientific institute rather than Agency employees.

2.  We are quite certain that Sternberg meant well and had our benefit in mind when he made this suggestion. Sternberg has been cooperative and helpful to us over a number of years. His suggestion particularly aims to simplify our problem of making initial contact with USSR nationals. They are particularly sensitive and suspicious, and CIA has a very ominous meaning to them according to Sternberg.

3.  We explained to Sternberg that we cannot do what he suggested, but in turn we suggested that in instances where a new arrival is ill at ease, we should wait a few weeks or months until the new arrival has settled down, found a place to live, and hopefully, a satisfactory place of employment.

4.  We did, however, tell Sternberg that we will discuss his suggestion with our associates interested in this particular problem.

1. This memo covers subjects discussed in references.

2. Since Tereshko came into this country as a refugee under the auspices of the International Rescue Committee in New York City we do not have any commitments to assist him in his re-settlement problems whether they include job assistance or assistance in firming up his immigration status to this country. We, however, also realize that he has been a very cooperative and prolific reports producer for the intelligence components. We want to make clear that we have no commitments to help Tereshko.

3. Tereshko should find his own way to mail letters to Minsk through parties located in other cities. Subject mentioned that he has friends in New York City whom he could use for this purpose.

4. We contacted the office handling Tereshko's refund for his rubles and rupees and were informed that he will shortly receive a check for US$125.00 plus some gold rubles which could not be changed for him, when we receive the money in a week or two, we will forward it to you.

5. Apparently Tereshko feels an attraction to work for Radio Liberty in Munich, which was offered to him. This again is his own decision although he has a good position and a fine future with his present company.

6. We have found from experience that defectors generally blame us for decisions and actions which fail and credit their own astuteness for those developments which succeed. We would like, however, to point

# Memorandum

TO: Director, Domestic Contact Service
(Mr. Murphy)

ATTN:

FROM: Chief, New York Field Offics

SUBJECT: Meeting with Edmund Cummings, Dept. of Immigration, US Catholic Conference
Ref: Dept. of State memo of 12 May 69 from Wa. C. Trucheart, forwarded to NYFO on 16 May 69.

NY#399-69
DATE: 12 June 1969.

1. On 6 Jun 69 Deputy Chief, NYFO, accompanied by C/S Elliff, met with Edmund Cummings to discuss any aspects of the relationship between his office and the Agency that might be unsatisfactory to him. This appointment was requested by NYFO as a result of the comments made by Cummings in reference memo.

2. When we opened the discussion with the statement that we had heard indirectly that the question of cooperation with the CIA had arisen at the ACVA meeting, Comings immediately stated that this was indeed the case, and for his part, he wished to have no contact at all with our Agency. Invited to elaborate on his reasons, Cummings said it could be very "embarrassing" were it to become known that he had furnished information on Czechoslovak refugees to the CIA. He later stated that it could be extremely dangerous for refugees to have contact with the Agency, since if this fact were known, it could bring harm to themselves or to their families still in Eastern Europe. If he had furnished the informa- tion about the location of a refugee to whom harm later came, it would cause him great anguish. He knew, he said, of an instance in Connecticut in which a refugee who had cooperated with the Agency was beaten up by Communist agents. Curmings did not respond to our invitation to elaborate on this incident, which we said was unknown to us. Cummings said that not only was he concerned about CIA activities involving refugees, but that if cognizant, the US bishops would be unhappy about CIA involvement with organizations such as the US Catholic Conference. Again, Cumings declined to elaborate. Cummings suggested that we get our information from the I&IS to whom the US Catholic Conference furnishes data and he was unsympathetic to our desire to have this information on a more timely basis than was possible with reliance on IS records. He also suggested that arrange- ments to see refugees in the US be made with the refugee in Surope and that the refugee be given a telephone number to call after his arrival. Res- ponding to our direct question, Cummings said he viewed cooperation with the FBI in a different light and would not deny its agents information they requested.

NY#399-69
12 June 1969

3. We wish to emphasize that Cummings made none of the statemente to us that he did in paragraph two of reference memo. On the contrary, in response to our direct question, Cummings said that his objections were those of principle rather than of manner of approach by the NYFO. At no time during our conversation with him did he make any objection to the procedure set up between him and C/S Elliff to facilitate the acquiring of the information we requested. We do not have any doubts that Cummings did indeed make the statements attributed to him in reference memo, but it is at least interesting that he specifically refuted them in our presence. After displaying nothing but hostility toward the Agency, during cur entire meeting, he invited us to call upon him in the future if he "could ever do anything for us personally." Obviously we do not expect to contact him on any basis in the future and we are certain that he does not anticipate further inquiries from this office.

4. c/s Elliff reports as follows on her contacts with Cummings and other officials of the Dept. of Immigration, US Catholic Conference:

> [Figure: Handwritten marking 'B' on the left margin]

"The first contact with Cummings was on 11 Sept 68 and the results of that meeting are contained in NY#677-68 of 11 Sep 68. This was a straight-forward request for informa- tion on how the UG Catholic Conference would handle the in- flux of refugees. As can be seen from the memo, Cummings was cooperative and, in fact, offered more assistance to us than we later requested. We spoke on the telephone with Currnings a few weeks later to say that, in all likelihood, we would only be needing to ask for address information on selected refugees occasionally. For this information, he referred us to Mrs. Irene Bilinski. On 12 Dec we saw Mrs. Bilinski who we cooperative furnishing information on a specific Czechoslovak refugee. Upon our return from Washington in late January 1969, a number of requests had piled up and we tried to obtain the needed information through Mrs. Bilinski. She pleaded that they were very busy, extremely behind in their filing and asked that we call on her later."

B-69-169


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 131

NY#399-69
12 June 1969

"Since it appeared in late March that Mrs. Bilinski would not be available in the foreseeable future, we called again on Cummings and explained the problem. We said we understood the problems involved for them in providing this information, in view of the fact that they were extremely busy, and said we would appreciate anything he could do to facilitate matters. There was one address we needed urgently and this Cummings obtained for us while we waited. We left with him about six three-by-five cards on other refugees, plus a stamped self-addressed envelope, and asked that he return the cards, with the address and employment data added, at his convenience. After that, we sent Cummings two letters requesting data on additional individuals and received replies in due course. After his receipt of the second letter, Cummings called Deputy Chief, NYFO (whose name he had obtained from Charles Sternberg of the International Rescue Committee) to check on Miss Elliff's bona fides. According to Deputy Chief, NYFO, Cummings was satisfied that our inquiries were legitimate and only expressed the hope that they could be kept to a minimum. We suggested the mail procedure agreed to by Cummings only in the interest of saving the time of an obviously overworked organization.

"When the account of Cummings' complaints to the Department of State official reached us, we endeavored to set up an appointment for ourselves and Deputy Chief, NYFO, to see him. Our first call in this regard was on 19 May. He said it was a very busy week and asked us to call later. We called the following week and he again stated he was extremely busy. We said we did have one address to ask him about and asked if we might see him briefly. He invited us to write him for the information, and assured us that this would be entirely satisfactory. We wrote on 26 May and he replied the following day, much faster than he had previously. When we called him on 6 June, he invited us to meet with him that afternoon. We estimate that we have requested address and employment information on about 13 individuals. Since this is the only data requested from Cummings, we do not understand his statement in reference memo that he had "become concerned over the numbers and types of request." In addition to Cummings and Mrs. Bilinski, we have contacted Mrs. Olympia Boroni, whom we saw in 1967 in connection with Case 49,354. Although she could not furnish the current location of the individual in whom we were interested, she was extremely cooperative."

SUBJECT: CIA Requests to Voluntary Agencies in

With reference to our recent discussion of this subject, I am attaching a memorandum from Mr. Laugel of Ambassador Martin's staff on his meetings in New York with various representatives of the voluntary agencies. It would appear from his report that concern among the voluntary agencies over CIA approaches is more widespread than we had at first supposed.

SUBJECT: CIA Requests to Voluntary Agencies in New York

*Mrc 5 69-169*

Ambassador/Graham Martin has asked me to inform you of conversations which were held in my presence by certain voluntary agency representatives with regard to CIA requests for information on Eastern European refugees (primarily Czechs) who have been arriving in the U.S. as a result of the Czechoslovak-USSR crisis. The following information was obtained on a confidential basis while I was in New York this week to work on an unrelated project:

*A. 2257*

A41194

(1) On May 5, after concluding my own business discussions, Dr. Jan Papanck, President of the American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees, Inc., expressed his deep concern over being asked to supply information on the whereabouts of his former countrymen. Dr. Papanek told me that the CIA is checking on a large number of Czech refugees, most of whom have no special experience or qualifications which would seem to be of particular interest to the United States. He knows that many of these people are being subjected to intensive interrogations which bewilder and frighten them. The procedure was initiated last October by a CIA man who identified himself as Norman. N. Graber. Dr. Papanek receives his requests by letter (he showed me one sample) which simply lists the names and other basic data, either immigration number or date of birth. The return address used by the CIA is P.O. Box 1294 in Grand Central Station, to which Dr. Papanek is to send his reply - that is, the latest U.S. address recorded in his files. Dr. Papanek did not mention a specific number of names or requests but he said they are growing and he is very uncomfortable about it; he does not want his good name or agency to become identified with the CIA. He indicated, in addition, that the method of operation seems heavy-handed in comparison to that of the FBI, whose agents present themselves in person, make their requests known

and are serviced to the extent permitted by Dr. Papanek. If this information is essential to U.S. interests, Dr. Papanek cannot understand why it is not handled on an intra-governmental basis -- namely have the CIA obtain its information from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is responsible for alien registration in the United States.

(2) On May 6, after concluding my work with Mr. Edmund Cummings, Associate Director of the U.S. Catholic Conference, the question again came up. Mr. Cummings expressed his agitation over the seemingly amateurish and scattershot method by which the CIA is operating in this field. He also questioned the value of interrogating simple refugees who are not defectors with special qualifications or background. Mr. Cummings said the groundwork was laid sometime ago (no date mentioned) by a female officer of the CIA, and that he agreed to the exchange of mail procedure utilizing the P.O. Box at Grand Central. However, he has become concerned over the numbers and types of requests. He suggested, as did Dr. Papanek, that INS might be the proper contact point for CIA. Mr. Cummings also mentioned that the FBI agents appear in person and he indicated that their approach seems more professional.

(3) I was also informed by Mr. Cummings that the International Rescue Committee, Inc., whose Executive Director is Mr. Charles Sternberg, was somewhat alarmed by the same situation. I had previously consulted Mr. Sternberg on my own project but he did not raise the CIA matter with me.

(4) On May 7 I attended (as an observer) a meeting of the Committee on Migration and Refugee Problems, American Council of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service, Inc., which was called to discuss refugee and related matters. The meeting was chaired by the Rev. John W. Schauer of the Church World Service; in addition to

Council officers, representatives of seven voluntary agencies were present. Those in attendance were:

Mr. Eugene Shenefield and

American Council of Voluntary Agencies

Mr. Edmund E. Cummings and
Mr. John McCarthy of the
United States Catholic Conference

Mr. Donald E. Anderson of the
Lutheran Immigration Service

Mr. Harry Freeman of the
United HIAS Service

Mr. Charles Sternberg of the
International Rescue Committee

Dr. Jan Papanek of the
American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees

Mr. Teymouraz Bagration of the
Tolstoy Foundation

Chairman Schauer also represented the
Church World Service

At one point the meeting went off-the-record to hear from Mr. Cummings of USCC, who had been assigned to study the 'CIA problem." But Chairman Schauer opened the discussion by announcing rather mysteriously that he had been in touch "with Washington" at the appropriate level -- implying that the Council should at least table the matter for the time being. Mr. Cummings then moved that (a) there would be no further discussion of it, and (b) each voluntary agency should deal with the CIA as it sees fit on an individual agency basis. His motion carried and the Council proceeded to other business.

# Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Chief, Contact Division

FOR: Allen Branch (Vienna)

FROM: Chief, New York Office

SUBJECT: Case: NY/19- Dr. Alexander Kremen's Defection and Interrogation.

1. Herewith a summary of this case, as requested in WA-61595.

2. The case was opened to this office by a telephone call from George
   Micalin in mid-morning on 20 Sep 63. The only information available to us
   at that point was an account in the New York Times of 17 September. Freund
   of IWO was instructed to contact Mr. Joe Semaitis (Assistant Special Agent in
   Charge), New York FBI: the FBI had notified CIA through Washington Liaison:
   that it would be ready to turn over subject to us for interrogation some time
   on this date, and the details were to be discussed with Semaitis.

3. Semaitis passed Freund along to the supervisor and special agent
   handling the case (Rosen known to us), and we learned that the FBI had not seen
   the subject as yet because of unexpected delays at Immigration and Naturaliza-
   tion Services. The expected schedule was for subject to be fingerprinted and
   released by INS in the early p.m. The FBI estimated that its own interroga-
   tion could be accomplished within about 45 minutes. As envisaged, FBI
   interrogation would be carried out at International Rescue Committee office,
   where subject would be turned over to us at about 3 p.m.

4. Above information was phoned through to Allen Branch, which advised
   that two OSI representatives, Drs. Hoffman and Huber, were to be dispatched
   to New York to conduct an interrogation that afternoon. Numerous telephone
   calls between this office and Allen Branch, the VOI, and IRC continued
   throughout the afternoon. The FBI very graciously agreed to make a staff
   translator of Czech descent available for our interrogation. Charles Sternberg
   of IRC agreed to stay in his office until we could take the subject off his
   hands when it became clear that the OSI representatives were late in arriving.

5. Dr. Hoffman, OSI, and Dr. Huber, Medical Staff, in fact reached HYFO
   at 1:50. There was considerable misunderstanding between them and this office
   concerning the situation. They were unaware that subject had been interrogated
   until late the previous day by INS and was somewhat exhausted by interroga-
   tions and procedures on 20 Sep at INS and involving the FBI. They expected
   to operate under cover (to be furnished by FBI or this office), they expected
   to be provided with a secure interrogation facility wired for sound, they
   understood that Czechoslovak authorities had attempted to reach the subject.
   In the circumstances, they remained at IWO in the care of the Field Office
   chief, while Freund proceeded to IRC.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

6. Conversations as I recall them, revealed the following: That subject can expect any two CIA men from Washington. That Allen French's tone indicated the happiest moment after talking for several hours. Further discussion with Chief, MTD, and with Sternberg led to the decision that subject was to remain in Sternberg's area over the weekend, that any interrogation in the circumstances would be unwise (particularly as the transcript of the exhaustive 1955 interrogation would be available). Allen Branch should Interrogatle would be valuable only in the following suggestion re Allen Branch to bring him in to see possible installation for detailed exploitation should be followed.

7. Freund took the FBI translator and subject out for supper and developed a few facts. Subject was overly optimistic about the results of de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia and the current "new-look." which he hoped would continue for one to two years. He was staying with one of the other 24 physicians in his friend, Danes, and felt confident that nothing that matters in the other 24 will induce him to Danes. Subject was very willing to leave New York for internship or elsewhere. He spoke about his political convictions-anti-communist, particularly Czech-and his admiration for the US, also a new fort. Freund thanked the translator for his help. Interviewed subject re: his apartment (on dit not enter it), notified Chief, MTD, of developments. And reported to Moulin at the earliest opportunity (10250 2015).

8. On Monday, morning, 23 September, we received word that Allen Branch was ready to accept subject into his safe facility. Later that day, George Ingle, using a registered position, drove subject to Washington in the afternoon. An agreement reached earlier with Sternberg was re-affirmed in front of subject at the time that Freund picked up subject. He will assume full responsibility for subject's welfare, under procedures and considerations affecting aliens as promulgated by the INS. During this period (until subject is to be somewhere in the neighborhood of one week) that we will not share this responsibility. We want to make clear, however, that CIA was not in any way involved in this matter other than to avail itself of the opportunity to interview a source with recent experience in Czechoslovakia. Sternberg clearly understood this, and all subsequent behavior vis-a-vis us appeared to te seyond reproach. On our part, we will not further involved with living arrangements in New York, no opportunities. par to Luge.

9. The report shows that subject was returned (Rosenbrook driving) to New York on 3 October at a panel rack to Sternberg by Freund at 1400 hours that day. He advised Sternberg of subject's interests in relocating in West Germany or Austria frore be is expectation that he would be more readily admitted to medical practice in either country than in the US. Ultimately, he hoped to remain to him the US, with his family, if possible and enjoy coin him in the US.

was up to late that it was a worthwhile plan. The more good from

feartul of 1'rechos wan offerns to rebas ata al uppross of our faces to
Sternberg, but what to intormace him. In retrospect, Stern org
might wish to have more resources, based on his dealings with other
to run subject down.

10. Our next activity came when we called Sternberg, during, the early after-
    noon of October. We were in receipt of an Airtel, which purported us to ask
    some questions. We had learned from Sternberg, that the
    at IRC. Later that afternoon, Sternberg promised to phone us as soon as a subject arrived.
    since Major Prirrom lal had had there as what an appointment would be made.
    preliminary indicator of possibilities for a .org. We mentioned this
    to Sternberg and Ford .org representative. Later that afternoon, Stern-org
    phoned Jack, indicated subject had not shown up at IRC and that Sternberg
    would go to subject's hotel (near IRC headquarters).

11. The following morning, Sternberg phoned will vehemently indicated
    that something was amiss. He had not found a subject in his room at the Hotel
    Le Marquis, 12 East 31st Street (near 1 RC), on Monday afternoon. An IFC
    employee who had visited the hotel room on the morning, of Tuesday, 5 October,
    established that subject had not been near his room at least since the day
    before. Subject's belongings, including the briefcase he took wherever he
    went, were in the room. Sternberg concluded that subject had left his hotel
    room Monday morning and had not returned since then. Sternberg invited us to
    inform the FBI. He had no cupinout stipulations to anybody but ourselves.
    We notified Sivess, who suspected Sternberg share the FBI himself.
    Sternberg Lack and so advised him. Sometime later, the F I supervisor called
    us to pass the news to to us. Around noon, Sternberg, had a call from subject, who
    said he had chosen to return to Czechoslovakia. Subject answered in this
    affirmative when Sternberg inquired whether subject phoned from the Czechoslovak
    Mission to the U.H.. The conversation was very short. Sternberg new enough
    to inform FPB and the FBI. We expressed the hope that the US Government would
    take steps to make sure that subject was exercising free choice. A number of
    telephone calls from F I 111 and the FI ensued, in which the latest developments
    were played back to us. This office notified Deputy Chief, Contact Division,
    by phone.

12. During the afternoon, I was advised that [illegible] had received en inquiry

    were at the hotel and trying to plain or get a subject's belongings. The hotel manage-
    ment wondered whether it should comply. 11 had already hal checked with the FBI,
    which had expressed no interest. We thought that we might wish to go through
    his briefcase, but told the Haller that we had to check with headquarters
    before giving him a reply. Our call reached Desembrook, wit the reply (negative)
    came from McConnell. After nomy 20 minutes, we therefore advised INS that CIA
    has no special wishes with regard to subject's belongings. Our advice was that
    the hotel management treat him bractly as an ordinary John Doe.

    An inquiry Cron divess on 14 Octover (eased on in yogue sport that subject had
    been offered 2.00 for a appearance in the C) led to a call to Sternberg

During the first conversation, Mr. Kovo was not yet aware of subject's departure from the US. Nemecberg told he would merely express the hope that subject was interviewed by a US Government official before his departure. It was academic now to worry about whether there had been any dirty tricks involved on the part of the Czechoslovak authorities in persuading subject to return. It was not completely impossible that subject himself took the initiative and called the Czechoslovak Mission to learn about his family.

International Congress on Education of the Deaf

F00564

15 September 1961

S 70479

1.  Dr. Edgar Lowell, a contact of ours at the John Tracy
    Clinic, 806. W. Adams Blvd., Los Angeles 7, California, where a
    great deal of electronic research is carried on concerning deaf-
    ness, has advised us that he has been nominated as the Program
    Chairman for the International Congress on Education of the Deaf,
    which will be held in June 1963. The host for this Conference will
    be the Council on Education of the Deaf and the Congress will be held
    at Gallaudet College, Washington, D.C. The Coordinator for this
    International Congress will be Dr. Powrie V. Doctor of Gallaudet
    College, who will be working with the State Department on this par-
    ticular Congress.

2.  As Chairman of the Program Committee, Dr. Lowell will be
    required to go to Europe to attend a meeting of a similar European
    group planning their annual congress for about the same time, and
    will visit Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, England and Scandinavia
    to check on attendees. There is a possibility that he will also go
    to Yugoslavia at the same time.

3.  As a side-line it is also possible that Dr. Lowell will go
    to Moscow where he will visit Prof. E.N. Sokolov, Institute of De-
    fectology, Pogodina Str 8, Moscow G-117, USSR. Prof. Sokolov is
    well-known and has been active in previous Macey Conferences in
    which Dr. Aldrich and Jack Ford have been interested. We have re-
    ported through Dr. Lowell on both Sokolov and Prof. A. R. Luriya,
    and continuing correspondence between Sokolov and Dr. Lowell has
    also been reported.

4.  The Soviets will be invited to this Congress and if the
    present cordial re'ationship still exists unaltered by world events,
    no doubt Sokolov and/or others will certainly be interested if not
    attend this meeting.

5.  Enclosed is a rough outline of the program Dr. Lowell is
    responsible for which, of course, is still in the formative stage.
    Also copy of the original letter announcing the Congress
    is attached.

6.  We would be interested in-knowing your degree of interest
    in this particular matter, and entertain any suggestions you might
    have towards working with Dr. Lowell.

They ask you contact your sources at Gallaudet College in Washington for any information they have of Pasovic, who according to a Los Angeles memorandum of 14 November 1961, is Yugoslav and well-known as a Mohammedan working in the area of the deaf. He was apparently co-chairman on a committee with Mr. Bernart Tervoort, a Jesuit priest, who is a PhD and a linguist, and a Dutch national. The two, Pasovic and Dr. Tervoort met together in mid-October 1961 in Italy, at which time Pasovic expressed a desire to defect.

2.  To assist you in this assignment, we are attaching copy of the KE/YA memorandum of request and a copy of the Los Angeles memorandum of 14 November 1961, giving more details about the meeting between Mr. Tervoort and Pasovic.

Joseph Kovago, Ex-Mayor of Budapest

АТТИ: KR/USSR Branch A66377

1. Upon reading an article appearing in a Wilmington daily newspaper (copy attached), J. Jacobs visited ex-mayor of Budapest Joseph Kovago and got the following information:

2. "Ex-Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy was asked by the Free Europe Committee to form a new Hungarian Committee which will replace the two committees now in existence. The new committee is being formed because the Free Europe Committee wishes to economize and representation from several Hungarian political parties is wanted."

3. "Since I do not dare correspond with friends and relatives in Hungary and the US government is interested in current information on Hungary, I think I can give the name of an individual who is living in Vienna and is truly an 'operator.' His name is Dr. Thamas Pasztor. I believe he can be useful to the US because I recommended him for the purpose of gathering information on Hungary to Mr. David Martin of the International Rescue Committee. Most of the information gathered by Pasztor was used by IRC in reports on Hungary to the United Nations."

4. "Pasztor's address is I. Jakobergasse 4.III.18, Vienna, Austria, telephone 522-0-455. I am able to give the following biographic data on Pasztor: aged 46, divorced, official of the Pfeiffer Party after he was kicked out of the Smallholders Party, arrested for anti-Communist activities in 1948 or 1949, He was convicted and sentenced to death which was later commuted to life imprisonment. He was in the same political prisons with me at Vac and the Gyuto prison in Budapest."

5. "While in prison he was a 'double-dealer' and most prisoners liked him but distrusted him. He seemed to be able to find out about all news both inside and outside the prison. He was released from prison during the destalinisation period and escaped to the West during the revolution."

CONFIDENTIAL

Chief, Contact Division -2- 57-402

6. "He has been sending typewritten news reports on Hungary to several individuals in the US and Europe. I have received copies in both Hungarian and English. I sent the English copy to Mr. David Martin, IRC in New York. He does not charge for the service, but I remember seeing some of his news items in Hungarian newspapers after receiving his report. Pastor tells me that he is in financial straits and asked that I try to help him find someone who could use his service."

7. The 15 June 1957 issue is titled 'Picture of the Hungarian Situation' and it covers information on (a) General Situation; (b) Internal Politics; (c) The Terror, Public Opinion, Resistance; (d) Military Situation; (e) People's Economy, Industry and Agriculture; and (f) Miscellaneous news.

8. "I cannot vouch for his sincerity or loyalty but I would say that about 95% of him is good and the remaining 5% of him is questionable."

9. Enclosed for your retention is the above-mentioned news issue and you can use it for what it is worth. We shall be glad to get more detailed information if you wish.

Mr. James MacCracken

Tolstoy Foundation, Inc.

989 Eighth Avenue

New York, N. Y.

Dear Mr. MacCracken:

I thought you would like to know that the International Rescue Committee has organised a Commission of distinguished Americans who will visit Europe to investigate the refugee situation and issue a report on their return. We envision that the Commission's report would highlight the following factors.

1.  The conditions and needs of those Forgotten Men who have been sitting in refugee camps for years or who are inadequately resettled outside of camps. A portion of the report will be devoted to the Hungarian refugees who are still in camps.

2.  Make specific and general recommendations as to what can be done in the future to meet the needs of the "Forgotten Men".

Aside from highlighting the factors just mentioned, we feel that the Commission's report can serve, among others, the following constructive purposes.

1.  By dramatising and humanizing the problems of European Escapees, we believe that the Commission can help to create a climate of public opinion conducive to:

a. More generous support for U.S. programs concerned with the refugees, both private and governmental.

b. More flexible immigration legislation.

2.  The report of the commission will, of course, incorporate information from the survey now being prepared by the UNHCR. Indeed, we feel that the Commission can be of great assistance to the UNHCR by bringing his report and the refugee situation in general to the attention of the American


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

public. We believe that the commission is especially qualified to fulfill this function since they are a group of private Americans talking to fellow Americans.

The Commission will leave for Burope on October 15th and rotura on October 31st. Enclosed you will find their tontative schodule and a list of Commission members as of this date, In addition to the odoorvations of the Commission, their final report vill, of course, also represent intensivo ressarch on the part of our staff.

We have asked our overseas representativos, in the countries which the Commission will be visiting, to provide at least one opportunity for representatives of your organization to coot with the Commission if they wish se do so. If your representatives desire to moet with the Commission to discuss ma opecific aspect of the rofugee problem, I suggest that thay contact our representative in the country whore they are otationed.

I have not been in a position to write to you about the Commission before this since the Commission plans have just been finalised. If you desire further information, I am at your cervico.

    indicated that when he first got to Austria he was so
    frightened lest he be refused entry to the US that when he
    was asked whether he had any Communist connections he said
    he did not.

2.  A check with I & INS in Hartford indicated that
    this man was born 24 March 1923, had been under investigation
    back in February, that the case was closed, that the file
    indicated he was again under investigation as of April and
    that the case was evidently still open. It was also
    indicated that he was in the New Haven area, but there was no

# SUBJECT: ALEXANDER-SINCLAIR, John

1. Reference is made to the name check request from your office dated 28 January 1957, for information concerning Jobs ALEXAKONE-STECLAIR. The files of this office and those of a predecessor organization oratais considerable information concerning Bubject, the major part of which is not derogatory. This information includes reports of subject's personal views as of January 1943 on political and economic conditions in Shanghai, China, which could be made available to your office upon request. Following is information which may be deemed derogatory in one case and of intelligence interest in the other.

2. A usually reliable source reported in September 1951 that Bubject, then the director of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and an official at the British Foreign Office, accompanied the High Commissioner to Italy on his first unofficial trip in July 1951. Source stated that Subject was not at all tactful in his dealings with Italian officials and thus he met passive resistance. Furthermore, acting on behalf of the Commissioner and very eager to put at once as many British egouts as possible into positions under the Commissioner's cover, Subject appointed Marvel אס EKAR, Chairman of the International Refugee Organization (IRO) Review Board, to the position of representative in Italy. According to Source, this annoyed Prince DEL DRAGO, Italian envcy to IRD in Genova, Switserland, who stated that as long as IRU was functioning, there would be no other refugee representative working in Italy and that, after all, the Commissioner had to be first recognised by the Government. DZ BEAR was said to be "peracna nen grata" to the Italians.

3. According to a report dated 7 January 1954 from a fairly reliable source, it had been reported by various sub-sources that John ALRIARTER, British, Delegate to Italy of the High Commissioner of the Untied Fations for Refugees, vas a parson to be considered rather politically dubious. According to Source, on several occasions he had been excessively interested in favoring foreigners in Italy who had received expulsion notices as a result of their commercial activity and political contacts with Iron Curtain countries. Source stated that Subject was further reported to te on very friendly terms with Italians and non-Italians who vare clearly oriented toward the parties of the extreme left.

Deputy Director, Plans

SUBJECT: ALEXANDER-SINCLAIR, John

S-5564

1. Reference is made to the name check request from your office dated 28 January 1957, for information concerning John-ALEXANDER-SINCLAIR. The files of this office and those of a predecessor organization contain considerable information concerning Subject, the major part of which is not derogatory. This information includes reports of Subject's personal views as of January 1943 on political and economic conditions in Shanghai, China, which could be made available to your office upon request. Following is information which may be deemed derogatory in one case and of intelligence interest in the other.

2. A usually reliable source reported in September 1951 that Subject, then the director of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and an official at the British Foreign Office, accompanied the High Commissioner to Italy on his first unofficial trip in July 1951. Source stated that Subject was not at all tactful in his dealings with Italian officials and thus be met passive resistance. Furthermore, acting on behalf of the Commissioner and very eager to put at once as many British agents as possible into positions under the Commissioner's cover, Subject appointed Marcel DE BEAR, Chairman of the International Refugee Organization (IRO) Review Board, to the position of representative in Italy. According to Source, this annoyed Prince DEL DRAGO, Italian envoy to IRO in Geneva, Switzerland, who stated that as long as IRO was functioning, there would be no other refugee representative working in Italy and that, after all, the Commissioner had to be first recognized by the Government. DE BEAR was said to be "persona non grata" to the Italians.

3. According to a report dated 7 January 1954 from a fairly reliable source, it had been reported by various sub-sources that John ALEXANDER, British, Delegate to Italy of the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Refugees, was a person to be considered rather politically dubious. According to Source, on several occasions he had been excessively interested in favoring foreigners in Italy who had received expulsion notices as a result of their commercial activity and political contacts with Iron Curtain countries. Source stated that Subject was further reported to be on very friendly terms with Italians and non-Italians who were clearly oriented toward the parties of the extreme left.

1.  Peter Whild reports that subject has injected himself into the affairs of American Friends of Vietnam in a manner which he considers to be suspiciously like that of an intelligence agent. Since the subject is a former British subject but now a naturalized citizen, he poses the question to whether he might not be a long-term British agent. Peter reports that subject is seeing Duc-Phoonb regularly and is a close friend of Prince bah-hoi. Subject was a friend of President Diem when he was in this country.

2.  Subject has stated that he has money which he wants to invest in Vietnam. His present occupation is that of button manufacturer with which he has had considerable success.

3.  We admit that this is a little bit like seeing a bogey-man behind every bush but are a little curious as to the prospects for button manufacturing in Vietnam. We are only passing this on for what it is worth, which is probably not much.

d. A publication entitled "Livre Noir". This is a ref Viet black book against Dien, a copy of watch, according to du Berrier, vas given to Vice President Nixon during his last visit to Saigon. du Berrier says that there is a third portion of the book watch he does not Lave.

e. Press release, 25 September 1956, distributed by Dai Vist Party from Paris.

3. It is our impression that du Berrier has little to say by way of analysis that differs from the standard Dai Viet statements. du Berrier vakes no effort to hide his admiration for Hoan and his people. He says that in time, either Hoan or the Communists will win out in Vietnam and that 18 Hoan vins, he will need a couple of friends in the US. The implication coems plain that du Ferrier plans on being one of those "friends".

4. It seems to us that the best course on handling this material is to sond the whole batch to you in order to determine whether or not any of it is worth reporting or placing on file. We will furnish report elements for any of this material which is found reportable. If you find that copies of Evan's letters might to desired, they could possibly be obtained from du Berrier as such times as he is in New York.

1. Our contact in the Harold Oram Agency public relations office advises that a Mr. Rufus Philips who is connected with psychological warfare activities of the Agency, has been in contact with Oram and his agency for the purpose of arranging distribution of a film which was made in Vietnam and is concerned with the communist methods of operating in an agrarian community. Phillips was formerly in Vietnam under cover.

2. Our contact further advises that one John Gates, a former member of CIA in the Saigon station, was used by Oram as the narrator for the movie at a recent private showing. This same John Gates is reported by our contact to be extremely indiscreet insofar as security matters are concerned. Our contact is somewhat concerned that Gates will inadvertently reveal that he. (Peter White) was connected with CIA while he was in Vietnam. Peter's experience with Gates' indescretion dates back to his visit in Vietnam at which time Gates told his girl friend about what Peter was doing. (This has been previously reported.)

3. John Gates is now working part-time for the International Rescue Committee?

4. The film in question which now bears the title "The Fire and the Shadow" was in part or wholly financed by CIA. The Oram Agency has arranged distribution for showings in Formosa and Korea. The Oram Agency has had professional movie makers take a look at it for possible showing in the US. The professionals were highly critical and completely discouraged any attempt to have it distributed in the US.

5. We assume that Headquarters 00/C was not advised of this out of channels approach since the NYFO had not received any word of same. As you know Harold Oram and his Agency has been a contact of the NYFO for many years.

Subject: Information on Defection of North Koreans in Hungary to the Side of the Hungarian Freedom Fighters

5-5567

The Department has received information from a source in the International Rescue Committee that some North Koreans resident in Hungary defected to and sided with the Hungarian Freedom Fighters. Three recent Hungarian refugees, reported eyewitnesses to these defections, are now resident in the United States, as follows:

1. Thomas Orley, who can be contacted through the International Rescue Committee, New York
2. James Ambory presently studying at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York
3. Szaba Gall, presently studying at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York

The Department is very much interested in additional information on this subject, for example: Who were those who defected? (Students, industrial trainees, members of government missions, etc.) How many defected? How many are known not to have defected when given the opportunity? (In other words, how widespread were defections?) If defectors had any important positions, information on persons and positions is desired. What were the circumstances of the defection? What appeared to be the motivations for defection?

The Department would also be interested in information, if procurable, on the number and type of North Koreans in Hungary or other Satellites.

We would appreciate your handling this on a priority basis.

ORLEY INTVO

NEW YORK JANUARY 15--ONE OF HUNGARY'S LEADING ATHLETES
WHO FOUGHT IN THE FREEDOM REVOLT SAYS NORTH KOREAN, COMMUNIST
& CHINESE AND VIET NAM STUDENTS WERE AMONG THE SYMPATHIZERS IN
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SOVIET INTERVENTION LAST FALL.

IN AN INTERVIEW HERE TODAY, FORMER FENCING CHAMPION THOMAS
ORLEY RECALLED THAT "PRACTICALLY EVERYONE NOT INVOLVED IN THE
ACTUAL FIGHTING" LENT SUPPORT BEHIND THE SCENES TO THE FREEDOM
FIGHTERS. HE COULD NOT RECALL SPECIFIC DETAILS OF THIS "PASSIVE
RESISTANCE" BECAUSE AT THE TIME HE WAS "TOO BUSY FENDING OFF SOVIET
TROOPS AND TANKS WITH SMALL ARMS." BUT ACCORDING TO THE 33-YEAR
OLD REFUGEE ATHLETE AND STUDENT, THE TIDE WAS DEFINITELY FOR FREEDOM
--ONLY THE OVERPOWERING FORCE OF SOVIET ARMOR AND ARTILLERY
REINFORCEMENTS MANAGED TO HOLD UP THE COMMUNIST PUPPET REGIME.

WHEN THE FIRST WAVE OF THE REVOLT BROKE OUT IN BUDAPEST,
ORLEY WAS ON LEAVE FROM THE UNIVERSITY AT AN OLYMPIC TRAINING CAMP
IN TATA. HE SAID HE AND OTHER ATHLETES AT THE CAMP HEARD THE NEWS
OF THE FIGHTING OVER WESTERN RADIO BROADCASTS. IT CAME JUST
BEFORE THEIR SCHEDULED RETURN TO BUDAPEST. ORLEY AND SOME OF THE
OTHER ATHLETES JOINED THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS AS SOON AS THEIR
OLYMPIC TEAM BUSES RETURNED TO BUDAPEST. THE ATHLETES WERE RETURNING
TO THE CAPITAL TO PREPARE FOR DEPARTURE TO THE AUSTRALIAN
OLYMPIC GAMES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 185

THE YOUNG BARGAPS SAID BOTH THE STUDENTS & WORKERS
ANTICIPATED THE SEC, ONSLAUGHT OF THE SOVIET TROOPS IN EARLY
NOVEMBER, DESPITE OFFICIAL CLAIMS THAT THE PUPPET GOVERNMENT
WAS NEGOTIATING FOR THEIR WITHDRAWAL.

THE STUDENTS PREPARED FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF FIGHTING WITH
SMALL ARMS COLLECTED FROM THE MILITARY ARMORY AND THE FACTORIES IN
BUDAPEST. ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF SUPPLY, ORLEY NOTED, WAS A "SO-
CALLED LAMP FACTORY" FROM WHICH THE WORKERS THEMSELVES TOOK THE
ARMS THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS NEEDED.

IN THOSE FEW DAYS BETWEEN NOVEMBER 4 AND 6, ORLEY RECALLED,
THE SHEER NIGHT OF WELL OVER A THOUSAND SOVIET TANKS TURNED THE TIDE."
HE SAID "SO FIGHTERS, NO MATTER HOW BRAVE CAN WIN OUT WITH SMALL
ARMS AGAINST HEAVY ARMOR."

BY NOVEMBER 10, THE YOUNG FREEDOM FIGHTER AND HIS CLASSMATES
DISCOVERED THAT THE SOVIETS HAD TAKEN OVER MANY OF THE RAILROAD
STATIONS. HE SAID LONG EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMMUNISTS CONVINCED
HIM THAT EXPORTATIONS HAD BEGUN, AND HIM AND A FRIEND DECIDED TO
TRY TO ESCAPE.

ORLEY SAID THIS WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR HIM BECAUSE OF
HIS FAMILY. IT WAS ESPECIALLY HARD TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIS FATHER
SINCE ORLEY'S TWO BROTHERS HAD ALSO FLED HUNGARY IN 1947--ONE
TO BOLIVIA AND THE OTHER TO AUSTRALIA. THOMAS' FATHER WAS
FORMERLY A WORLD CHAMPION SKEET SHOOTER, A PRE-WAR FIELD
MARSHALL IN THE HUNGARIAN ARMY AND A LEADER IN THE NON-COMMUNIST
FREEHOLDERS PARTY. BECAUSE OF HIS BACKGROUND, THE COMMUNISTS HAD
FORCED HIM INTO A HARD FACTORY JOB DESPITE HIS ADVANCING YEARS.

NO MATTER WHAT HE DID AFTER THE REVOLT, THOMAS SAID, HE
KNEW THE COMMUNISTS WOULD RETALIATE.

HAD XEPT UP HIS STUDIES AS A BADLY HEEDED STUDENT OF PHARMACY

AT THE TIME ORLEY AND HIS FRIEND DECIDED TO HEAD FOR THE BORDER,
SAID SON, OCOHUNGARIANS ALREADY HAD FLED TO AUSTRIA. THOSE

COMPLENIST GUARDS DENIED THEY HAD FIRED A SINGLE SHOT.

ALL ALONS THEIR ESCAPE ROUTE, ORLEY RECALLED, FARMERS AND
WOLPERS, VIRTUALLY VITHOUT EXCEPTION, TOLD THEN WHICH ROADS VERS
SAFEST AND WHERE THE SOVIET SOLDIERS VERE STANDING GUARD..

THE YOUNG ATHLETE "VILL NEVER FORGET HIS FEELING ON REACHING
AUSTRIA ALIVE. IT WAS AS IF A GREAT ROCK HAD FALLEN FROM MY
HEART AND EVERYONE COULD BEAR THE THUANDER," HE SAID.

ORLEY CONSIDERS HIRSELS "LUCKY" TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BUILE

Then Practically the same requirement that is contained in the attached memo had previously been received from OCR as an USIA requirement.

On the latter we told OCR (Sturbits) that since the names of the people given were not their correct names we could not take action on the requirement since we need the right names to get an FBI clearance. USIA later told OCR to consider the requirement withdrawn and USIA would contact the tree people.

I told "migel's office of the USIA business and suggested that they contact USIA since it would look bad for all of us to be contacting the three people about the same thing. Smigel's office will do so. I told Carl Martin of the above developments and he took an autostat copy of State's memo to Camp Kilner.

INFORMATION ON ESCAPEE BEING RESETTLED

Mr. Tapak's village was in the area which was completely destroyed during World War II by the Russian Army. His family lost the mill and the farm. At this time he was in the Czechoslovakian Army, because he did not want to be a farm worker at a "colchoz", so he decided in 1952 to escape. While he was on guard in a border battalion, he crossed the border and came to Bavaria.

The I. R. C started in 1946. When I furt came acroos the name in 1950, I thought it was a Godsend as Palrs consider myself as a square peg in a round hole. Their registration were still opere then.

I am an unagonized citizen of the U.S.A. and as either myself nor my forebears can claimed to have fled from any kind of aggression. I am clearly not eligible for thin legal assistance, and must therefore apply to the American authoritus myself for reinstatiment. This fine point delivered with milch dignity and profundity left me more dazed than enlightened when I left their office, last year however, by careful observation and quoting precedent & managed to cireut a promise from them to pay for my passage aboard, when I receive my visa, felt not being B.P. and registered with them. I must arrange to get my own entry or destination visa for resettle meal. I must also consider the fressage money as a loan to be refunded when I am fully settled in a new country.

Alien Load - Eva Kralovensky

Central

F-5564

9 September 1955

1.  The Washington Office has received a routine alien
    lead on Eva Kralovensky, age 23, born in Czechoslovakia, S-5564
    "housewife", endorsed for US immigration by the International
    Rescue Committee. The Washington Office contacted one of
    its sources and learned that Miss Kralovensky was a stewardess
    on one of the three Czech airplanes which flew into West Germany
    (possibly West Berlin) about four or five years ago. We were
    also informed that she had been an employee of Radio Free Europe.

2.  The Washington Office contacted Alien Branch (Sivess)
    and asked if there was any reason to proceed further in
    locating Miss Kralovensky on the assumption that she was
    probably well-known in the intelligence community. Mr. Sivess
    checked and informed the Washington Office that there would be
    covert interest in Miss Kralovensky, and requested that her
    address be obtained and the appropriate field office be alerted
    for an alien contact.

3.  The Washington source finally determined that
    Mina Kralovensky moved to California but at the end of two
    weeks finally settled in Reno, Nevada. She can be contacted
    at 521 W 6th Street, Reno, Nevada.

# THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE

Since the start of the Cold War the International Rescue Committee has organized voluntary American assistance to aid refugees fleeing from Communist oppression.

When the tide of persons fleeing Soviet dominated countries into the free city of West Berlin reached more than 3,000 per day during the Spring of 1953, the Committee successfully mar-shalled more than $700,000 in gifts and donations of clothing, drugs and other necessities. This earned the commendation of President Eisenhower and leaders throughout America.

As the historic emergency increases, the Committee's work continues to uphold America's belief in the indivisibility of freedom.

# The Turning Point

On June 17th, 1953 one of the most significant events of the 20th century took place. The inhabitants of the Soviet Zone of Germany rose in rebellion against their Communist overlords. For eight years they had been living under conditions of plavery and starvation.

The insurrection began in East Berlin on June 16th. It was begun initially by a few workers but within hours it had spread to every level of the population. By the 17th of June the uprising had spread throughout the East Zone-a completely unorganized, spontaneous revolt.

At 11:00 o'clock the morning of June 16th the workers in block 10, Stalin Allee, decided to organize a demonstration to protest the raising of the work norm by the regime. By 2:00 o'clock that same afternoon, the mob of people which had grown from 200 to over 20.000 became revolutionaries. Surging in front of the East Zone Government building in East Berlin, they demanded not only the lifting of the norms but free secret elections, the unification of Germany and the abdication of the East German government.

The stories contained here are the stories of a few of those brave men and women from East Germany who played leading roles in the revolt and had to flee to the West. They are representative of 1.000 leaders, many of whom have subsequently been sentenced to death by Communist courts. Some were intellectuals and profes sionals. Most of them were workmen: AlH are men who deserve the undying gratitude and support of free men everywhere.

> [Figure] Bare Fists Against Armed Might. Historical Proof of the Perennial, Inextinguishable Urge of the Human Heart for Freedom.

## Stalin Allee Block 40...

### A CONSTRUCTION WORKER

(WOLFGANG THELUICH was a building con struction laborer working on Block 10, Stalin Aller.)

"When the work norms were increased the men were furious. We began daily to gather in small groups before and after work. The fear that had made us so cautious gradually began to dissolve. There was, after all, little more to lose.

"By the morning of June 16 we were reso lute. As always, we entered the building on which we were working and took our sta tions. But this day we sat down and refused to work. There was no organization, no leader. but each man knew what had to be done. The foreman dashed in gaping with disbelief. His eyes turned to the spot where the norm in crease order had been posted. Two men walked in with a freshly painted sign-The Work Norms Must Be Decreased. The cour age of these men inspired the rest of us to action.

"A concrete worker leaped onto a heap of stones. I leave it to you as individuals! Those

# The "Free Youth" Revolt...

## A 20-YEAR-OLD GIRL

(ELLA SARRE, an instructress within the Communist Youth Movement, [FDJ] is a dark haired girl of twenty with pert, intelligent eyes.)

"As I stood in the crowd before the government building, a fellow instructor came up to me and told me to take careful note of the people sympathetic to the demonstration and give him a complete report that evening. I was embarrassed by his apparent hurry to leave the square and told him if he was so afraid for his life he had better jump on a tram in a hurry and get out.

"A few minutes later I forced my way through the crowd and jumped to the rostrum. Many people recognized me as a devoted member of the FDJ. They hooted and taunted me. Never before had I realized how hated the FDJ was.. Infuriated by the refusal of the Communist leaders to appear and by the open cowardice of my male FDJ companion, I tore off my FDJ jacket and threw it to the ground. The jeers became cheers.

"I gathered my strength and shouted a warning to the crowd that members of the FDJ and SED were in the crowd and would not only try to dissuade them from the demonstration but also would report them. I shouted, 'Do not allow them to break you up! Stick together!' People began to examine their neighbors. Fist fights started as the hated Communists were spotted. I wanted to say more, but my strength was gone. A new life had begun for me."

# The Revolt Spreads...

## AN ENGINEER

(N.N., A Mechanical Engineer, Brandenburg.)

"There were only twenty in my group as we marched into the Brandenburg area. At that time we knew only that, according to a broadcast from West Berlin, the workers in East Berlin were on strike. Although we knew that strikes in the Communist Zone were considered political crimes and punishable by two years in prison, we marched on with a feeling of exhilaration. As we strode along we beckoned to the people on the pavement and in a few minutes our number had increased to about five hundred.

"As we approached a factory protected by high iron gates, we noticed employees shouting from the windows. 'We have been locked in. Come, help us. We will go with you.' A pile driver was found and we stormed the gates. The employers rushed out and embraced us.

"At this time, we still thought we were the only demonstrators in the city. As we neared the center of the city, we were amazed and overjoyed to find thousands of people converging from all directions. We had not fully realized that our people, constantly intimidated by spies and police controls, could rise up as one man without a strong central leadership, no weapons-nothing but determination and hope. We were overwhelmed at what we saw."

# The Red Flag At Brandenburg Gate Comes Down...

## A TRUCK DRIVER

(HORST BALLENTIN is a 20-year-old truck driver of East Berlin.)

"I looked down into the crowd and saw three Soviet officers looking helplessly upward as I climbed to the top of the tower and shinnied up the pole. I flung the flag to the ground with great contempt and watched the people tear it to pieces. They applauded and shouted in a way I had never heard before."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

- Two hours later when I had the honor of installing the Bear Flag of West Berlin, the Russians had brought three tanks into the square. As I began pulling up the flag they began to fire. Somehow I was able to finish my task and jump to the ground. The flag of West Berlin was in its right place and, miraculously, I was safe."

At Magdeburg...

## A BAND LEADER

HANS HERZBERG, band leader at the city theatre, was the strike leader under whose guidance the FDJ (Communist Youth Movement) office, Communist Party Headquarters and the home of the Chief Commissioner of Police were stormed. No event of the day impressed Herzberg as much as the occurrence at Magdeburg station!

"After we disarmed the Vopos (People's Police) on duty at the station, we tore down the hated 'Passage of Interzone-Dispatching Sign.' As though this in itself could accomplish the task, the crowd began shouting, 'There are no borders anymore.'"

"As the interzonal train arrived in the station, the frightened passengers locked the doors and windows, fearing an attack by Communist soldiers and police. As soon as they saw our sign 'The SED is beaten,' the windows and doors were opened and the people burst out, embracing each other, shouting, crying and some even giving away their possessions in celebration, assuming that the union of the East and West was an accomplished fact."

"We asked them to spread the word along on their way to Berlin. At this time we still thought that rebellions were taking place only in Magdeburg and Berlin. We were jubilant a few hours later when we learned from RIAS (Voice of America) and NWDR (West Berlin station) that uprisings were occurring all over East Germany."

"The next train to arrive contained a prisoner car. After a few tense moments we managed to gain control of the train and get the cells open. One of the prisoners was a 74-year-old farmer who was imprisoned a year before because he had not been able to meet his quota. He was speechless with fright and disbelief. When he was finally convinced that he was a free man, he broke down and wept, overcome with joy. I had to carry him away."

Prisoners Are Freed...

## A LOCKSMITH

WERNER MENGELSDORF is a locksmith. He led the heroic liberation of 80 political prisoners in Magdeburg.

"A mob 3,000 strong stormed into the courtyard of the prison in Magdeburg. The prisoners pressed their worn, pale faces against the bars. A woman in the crowd started to scream as she recognized her husband who had been arrested only two days before."

"The wooden doors of the prison splintered under the weight of the surging crowd. The guards fled. The metal door to the cell block was pried open. Mengelsdorf called for the locksmiths and together they opened the cell doors. Indescribable scenes followed. One prisoner cried, 'Freedom! Freedom!', then fell to the floor crying. A young man sentenced to 25 years for crimes against the state stepped out of his cell into the arms of the girl to whom he had been engaged. Neither knew the other was there until the doors opened. They embraced, wordless."

"Soviet tanks rumbled into the prison yard before all the prisoners could be released. Mangelsdorf himself barely escaped with his life. His only route of escape lay in swimming the Landwehrcanal which separates East and West Berlin at certain spots. He waited until dark and then made it, narrowly escaping death from Soviet bullets which peppered the water around him. He is today in one of the camps in West Berlin, destitute but resolved that one day will come when all of East Germany as well as the satellite countries will again be free."

*Executive Director*

Dear Mr. Fondiller:

I have just returned from Berlin. I am reporting to you as one of many observers who are agreed that the weaponless men and women of Eastern Germany stand as the first line of defense between us and the tyranny of Soviet Power. The entire world is now aware of what has been happening in East Berlin and East Germany since June 17, 1953.

But do you know why this most remarkable revolution occurred - how these people just like the young couple next door, the truck driver down the street, the band leader - have been able to rebel against overwhelming odds? It is not only out of sheer desperation because of the insufferable conditions under which they have been living. People in the other satellites are suffering. These are people who are desperately weary of tyrants of all political shades and colors. Through the window of West Berlin we gave them hope for a better world and they have become our allies. We cannot let them down. When we do we have lowered the first defense in the battle against tyranny over the minds, hearts and bodies of men.

The enclosed personal accounts of the June 17th rebellions are dramatic proof of man's invincible desire for freedom. The International Rescue Committee is doing everything possible to aid these brave men and women including some of the resistance leaders and proscribed members of their families. We need your help to continue this vital work.

We are asking you to send us your contribution so that we may continue to sustain the bodies of these brave men and women in whom the flame of freedom is burning. The aid we are extending to them is a message the whole world understands. A message which says that we believe in the dignity and goodness of people enough to help them survive their worst times so that they can fight for better times.

Sincerely,

Leo Cherne

We made an informal inquiry of the New York League for the Hard of Hearing to determine (a) whether it would be possible to teach a person to lip-read efficiently, (b) whether it would be possible to teach lip-reading to a person who is losing his hearing, and (c), if so, approximately how long it would take and how much such training would cost.

2. We have found that it is possible to teach both hearing and persons who are in the process of losing their hearing to lip-read proficiently. We did not go into the problem more thoroughly since New York League could not tell us how long such training would take. We do know that simple phrases can be learned in a short time. Also, we found that the league has taught lip reading to hearing persons in special cases which they described as "special cases". (We gather that the FBI has used agents as lip-readers in the past and it is possible that they were the "special cases").

3. As the New York League for the Hard of Hearing operates under the New York State Board of Education we were unable to determine the cost of lip-reading training in our informal inquiry. If we could have more details, we could try to obtain more definite information.

4. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Miss Bolster at extension 2761.

# Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Chief, Contact Division

FOR: Alien Branch (Czajkowski)

FROM: Chief, New York Office

DATE: 27 February 1953

SUBJECT: Concern about Physical Security of
Gisela Wassiliev, IRC Representative in Berlin

REF: Our TK NY-9780, dated 30 Nov 51 (to Alien Branch)

1. In reference wire, David Martin recommended subject individual (whose name he spelled "Wasiljev") for contact by this office. Martin described this German national, wife of a Russian DP then and now in the US, as "exceptionally capable, intelligent, with rare political understanding". She has been director of the Berlin office of the International Rescue Committee for some three years (perhaps longer). As you know, the IRC has been prominent for aid given to West Berlin and is currently in the midst of a campaign for aid to refugees arriving there in increasing numbers from the East.

2. Mr. Becker, present executive director of the IRC, has passed on to us a letter from Mrs. Wassiliew, dated 23 February 1953, in which she reports alleged attempts on the part of "the East" to kidnap her. In view of her activities and her connection with Rainer Hildebrandt's Kempfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit, there may be some basis for her fears. Mr. Becker, who knows her as a calm person not given to hysterics, is deeply concerned about her safety and has stated that he would have replaced her with a U.S. citizen if it were not so difficult to find a qualified successor. He has requested that we communicate with any U.S. agency or department in a position to provide physical security for persons representing U.S. interests in Berlin.

3. We have promised Mr. Becker to pass on his request to our superiors, but we told him that we were not aware of CIA facilities abroad or of CIA responsibility for coordinating action abroad with other appropriate US Government agencies. We therefore suggested that Mr. Becker himself communicate with such agencies to the test of his ability and did not commit CIA to any action upon his request.

4. If, in your judgment, the covert staffs might be interested in this problem or a justifiable representation to other agencies (e.g. Defense or State) can be made, we feel that such action would serve U.S. security interests and, incidentally, benefit IRC in a measurable way. We are attaching Mrs. Wasiliew's letter for whatever use you care to make of it.

5. This office has had no contact with Mr. or Mrs. Wassiliew, and these individuals are not aware of any possible CIA interest, to the best of our knowledge.

6. Please advise whether there is anything you can do, whether Mr. Becker should approach another Government agency (if he has not done so in the meantime), and what reaction, if any, we may pass on to Becker.

Memo to: BE (cc: Munich, Frankfurt)

From: Gisela (Wassiliew)
(3. Emserstr., Berlin Wilmersdorf
Germany)

Dear Abe:

I am sorry that I must bother you with my personal problems, but since I don't know what to do under the present circumstances I am begging you for understanding.

As you know I alwaya had trouble with the other side". If somebody works in this field he must be endangered after a certain time. I believe. I told you about the calls in Russian and about the spies who are constantly around me since about 1951. I am used always to be on the alert and to look around me carefully, this is the only thing I can do. In addition to that I bought a dog in the summer of last year.

Since about four months the attempts of the East to get have increased. I had several rencontres with them and have informed the police. But since we have so many people here in Berlin who have good reasons to feel endangered they cannot watch everybody constantly and the person in question is more or less left to his own measures.

Last Wednesday night I ran into a situation which would have meant the end for me if a friend of mine had not happened to be with me. This way they did not dare to because they are accustomed to see me always walking alone; and cars and helpers disappeared (not around). I have reported my situation again to the police, they promised to do what they can, but it is so that I have to work out something that makes it a little more difficult for them to complete their plan.

With friends who work in the same field and who know about these things I have worked out the following: I must sell my dog and buy a sharper one. when I bought him in July last year the situation was completely different. I did it merely as a measure of precaution not because I had proofs of the danger I was living under. For this purpose he is good but not for the purpose for which I need him now, ha is not sharp enough. They have already calculated my dog into the plan. I absolutely need another much sharper one. But I must tell you frankly that even if I sell my dog I would not be able to buy the new one, because they are terribly expensive. Then I have decided that I cannot go to the office and come home alone anymore. I can move from one of my friends to the other for a certain time but not constantly. A friend of the Committee will pick me up every morning and bring ra home at night in his car. In the meantime I'll talk to Mrs. Wolff of arbeitervoalfahrt, who has an office car and arrange with her that her driver pick me up. But this will take some time; until I have reached her and discussed the matter with her.

Please don't believe that I am hysterical, on the contrary. But now it is so that I not only feel endangered but I have knowledge of their intentions and I an sure I would not get out again, once they have had hold of me.

Cordially yours,

/s/ Gisela

AT THAT TIME, HE ASSURED US OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH US TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND IMMEDIATELY SUPPLIED PROOF OF THIS BY FURNISHING DETAILED BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ON US RPT 80 REFUGEES WHICH THE IRC BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY; HIS COOPERATION IN THIS PROJECT WAS SPLENDID.

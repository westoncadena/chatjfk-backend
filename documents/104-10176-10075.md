1. According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER, LITAMIL-7, who

LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Allough Subject was never a very productive asset, provide information on activities of the installation and individuals working therein. In approximately 1969-70, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy, ending her previous usefulness. In spite loss of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with the personnel, including the ambassador. For this reason maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly upon retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them. This was somewhat incongruous. since she did not feel such loyalty when she was working in the embassy.

2. Subject met FAHLANGER, as approximately six times in home. The last time she was told that in view of retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the embassy, our relations with would be terminated. However, if reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This, of course, never happened.

3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, did receive spot payments for the information submitted, also received occasional small gifts at Christmas time and ca her birthday. The

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/OA

ATTENTION:

SUBJECT: LITAMIL-9
201-329609

1. LITAMIL-9 returned to Mexico from Cuba in October 1966. On 8 November he was contacted and debriefed by Mexico City Station. Throughout the month of November he debated the question of whether or not he should return to Cuba. In the first week of December 1966, he decided to remain in Mexico.

2. Since it was believed that LITAMIL-9 would have little access to LIRICS or to persons of interest in Mexico, he was terminated and the balance of his escrow account was paid to him on 9 December 1966. However, it has since become apparent that from time to time it would be valuable to OFACT to contact LITAMIL-9 for information on PBRUMEN personalities. He is acquainted with a large number of persons who themselves are of interest to OFACT or who could supply information on third persons on whom information is needed.

3. Therefore, provisional operational approval and subsequent operational approval for such occasional contact with LITAMIL-9 is requested. It is not planned to pay him a salary or formalize an agent relationship. LITAMIL-9 would only be contacted when specific needs for information arise and the possibility exists that he has or could obtain the information.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CI/OA

SUBJECT: Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. The Provisional Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9 (C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.

2. In discussions with the field case officer for this operation, WH/1/Mexico has found that there is no way to determine when, or whether, LITAMIL-9 will again leave Cuba. For reasons of personal security, LITAVIL-9 has not been able to function as a reporting BULK, Cuba in early March 1965. Letters to his brother, LITAMIL-17, and reports from occasional Cuban official travelers transiting Mexico indicate that LITAMIL-9 is well and is employed by the National Cultural Council.

3. LITAMIL-9 is now an inactive agent. The Station has recently proposed that his salary cease accumulating as of 30 June 1966. If and when he again manages to leave Cuba, he will be contacted and a full assessment of his future usefulness will be made. Owing to the fact that his sister-in-law is a secretary to Fidel Castro it is expected that he will be a valuable source of information, at least for an initial debriefing period.

4. It would be appreciated if the POA on LITAMIL-9 could be extended for six months. If at the end of that time he has not left Cuba, it will be proposed that the POA be allowed to expire.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CI/OA

SUBJECT : Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITAMIL-9, who has recently returned to Cuba, and has accepted an FI mission from Mexico Station. The Station has expressed its reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged in 1959 that LITAMIL-9 was a Communist, since this course of action would unnecessarily draw attention of this officer to our interest in LITAMIL-9. WH/1 has concurred in this decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory information on LITAMIL-9 is far outweighed by his performance record.

2. Realizing the risk involved in working with any Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAMIL-9's excellent record of cooperation, plus his acceptance of the idea of continued cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of an Operational Approval. Additionally, we have had audio coverage through the telephone in LITAMIL-9's office for the past two years or more, and during this time the Station has used the installation for spot checking his information, and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his veracity and security or suspect that he is under control of the Cuban service.

3. Attached for your review are several contact reports of LITAMIL-9, as requested by Mr. Lally. Their prompt return will be appreciated. This office will be pleased to cooperate in any further review of this case which will facilitate the OA.

As such, this requires Headquarters approval, i.e. that of wa Division, for we recrulents a government official of a denied erea country.

2.  As described in MEXI-6696, LITAMIL/9 "serves es invaluable eyes and ears inside target establishment" reporting on information received in his government position.

a. no mention that they are using man without approval of any kind (the TOA granted for tour only automatically expired at the completion of tour session.)
b. no mention that he is deep in the LAURICHE requirements of the station.
c. Para #b should read REFLUTTER is a must.

28 February 1963

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: LITAMIL-9, Report of TDY, Andrew S. Parmers

1. During 21-26 February 1963, Andrew S. PARMERS travelled from Headquarters to Mexico City on TDY to train LITAVIL-9 on various clandestine, operational, techniques, including SW. Upon arrival in Mexico City PARMERS ascertained that LITAMIL-9 allegedly became of moral inbibitions, was unwilling to receive training and also unwilling to accept the SW systues Headquarters had issued for him, and which PARMERS had carried to Mexico City. Nevertheless, PARMERS met LITAMIL-9 three times to determine the agents precise objections and to overcome them if possible. Although the agents general resistance was not overcome. PARUS di review with T.TTAUTE_Q clandestine methods and techniques in a general way.

2. The first meeting was held at the Station case officers home, with the Case Officer present. LITAMIL-9 ex- plained his reasons for refusing to be trained and for cot being willing to communicate in Sw with KUBARK while in Cuba. Generally LITAMIL-9 claimed that he is very nervous, and incapable of performing clandestine tasks without having a nervous breakdown and at the sam time getting himself caught in the act because of his general incompetancy. Also, LITAMTL-9 was planning to stay at his brothers home in Cuba, and felt it would be unethical and immoral for him to be communicating clandestinely with KUBARK while accepting the hospitality of his brother and sister-in-law who are staunch supporters of the Castro regime. These agreements obviously had already been presented to the Case Officer who had already concluded that LITAMIL-9 could not be moved from his position. The agent furthermore, felt that there was no need for training or SW since he would be returning to Mexico after only three months in Cuba. He displayed a cable he had just received from his father ansvering LITAMIL-9's query as to what might be his next assignment. The cable stated that LITAMIL-9 would nost likely return to his present post in Mexico. The agent tre- fore felt that upon his return to Mexico City, he could be debriefed by his Case Officer. LITAMIL-9 rejected all attempts to convince him of our need for current info from inside Cuba. He was adament when we pointed out that he might not return to Kexico City as hoped, but might have to remain in Cuba having no means of contact. If this happens he plans to rest his position and return to Mexico as a private citizen, since he already is a registered "resident" of Mexico.

3. On Friday, 24 February, PARKERS spent most of the day visiting alone with LITAMIL-D at the latter's apart- ment. By the end of the day LITAMIL-9 had softened a little and had revealed some of the personality traits mentioned below. LITAKIL-9 also agreed to communicate with his Case Officer through open code in letters to his brother in MexicoRUMEN City. He also was willing to meet inside KUBARK, preferably if the contact was a diplomat but not Cuban. He agreed to take a set of cuff links as bona fides. As a suggestion, he mentioned that his friend, The Swiss Ambassador, nov serving in Madrid, Spain, would be an ideal contact. In revealing how zuch & contact could be performed and in discussing LITAMIL-9 nodus vevendi la Cuba, there was considerable discussions concerning operational Security and clandestine procedures LITAMIL-9 can apply while in Cuba.

4. LITAMIL-9 during this meeting also presented, in logical sequence, his reasons for believing that he will return to Mexico City. Rasically he fuele that hatween tha fact that he has many contacts in Mexico City (where he was lived and worked for many years) and the fact that his sister- in-law in Cuba has a responsible position with considerable influence in the Castro Government, he LITAMIL-9 will be re- assigned to his present post in Mexico City after three months of leave, consultations, and training in Cuba.

5. The third meeting ocurred in the evening of 25 Februar, in a car pick up situation, with the Case Officer present. This time. LITAMIL-9 was less willing to communicate with KUBARK while in Cuba than he had been during the previous meeting, but with some reluctance, agreed to the use of open code and to be contacted by some diplomat. This meeting. there- fore, was a routine operational meeting, with his Case Officer in charge.

6. Based upon their three meetings, PARMERS formed the following opinions of LITAMIL-9: He is a shrewd oppor- tunist, willing to colloborate with KUBARK against the Castro Government, but not to the point where his personal security is endangered. He dislikes the Castro Regime because it has fumbled so bad'y, and because the current Cuban officials are crude and incompetant. He greatly admires the American people, but definitely feels that we are merely concerned about our own national security and well-being. LITAMIL-9 owes his first loyalty to the fine arts, has little Patriotic feelings towards Cuba, since he has lived in Mexico for so many years, and has declared himself to be a resident of Mexico. He is now serving the Cuban Government simply because he had an opportunity (through his sister-in-law) to achieve official status and income and still remain in Mexico where most of his

![Exchs:1: 291: 201: to:from:recipients]

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

personal friends reside.

7. Although at first appearance, and according to his own opinion statements, LITAMIL-9 appears to be extremely nervous because of his clandestine activities in behalf of KUBARK and against Cuba, after some discussion it was apparent that he actually relishes these clandestine actions that he would have angaged in then long before he did, and that he would have continued a covert relationship with KUBARK even after Castro falls, serving either in Mexico (where he has наду contacts of interest to KUBARK) or in Cuba in some post in Bome future government. He has excellent rapport with his present KUBARK case officer. He states that as long as KUBARK remains willing to accept that he has definite personal limi- tations, (since te can perform only those clandestine tasks related to his cover and cannot be trained or induced to do anything else) he will gladly continue collaborating with KUBARK as long as desired.

8. Actually, PARMERS feels that LITAMIL-9 would do most anything we would desire if KUBARK would someday establish some control over him. His present remarks concerning his moral quales are artificial. He has great appreciation for shrewdness and double play, and openly admits having engaged in it all his life. On many occasions he admits that he has accomodated himself to a situation for profit or because he knew that he could turn the tables eventually on his ad- versaries. When he is off-guard he admits to being a cool operater who can scheme and work behind his adversaries' backs. He shows many signs of enjoying doing what he does for and with his present KUBARK case officer.

9. In summary, although LITAMII-9 did not accept training or SW in the standard sense, PARMERS believes that the agents reluctance was based on his desire to take few risks. The agent is competent, his moral inhibitions are probably faked. He is convinced that he will return to Mexico soon, and desires to continue serving KUBARK if no greater risk is in- volved. Since ZUBARK at present has no clear control (monetary or ideological) over LITAVIL-9, it was difficult to impose KUBARK's will over him. But he is very willing to perform for KUBARK within the limitations he sets, and if someday we can satisfy, some personal need he might have, he has the pot ential of becoming a good controlled agent for KUBARK. He is intell- igent and by nature ho seems to instinctively conduct his clandestine operations in a securo manner.

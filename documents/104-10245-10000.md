# THASMISION DE ENFERMEDADES INFECCIOSAS

La trasmisión de una bacteria que causa enfermedades desde una persona enferma a una persona sana, se efectúa de diversos modos.

El agua transporta gran cantidad de bacterias. Por eso hay que hervir el agua. La candela mata los microbios.

La leche puede transportar también bacterias rógenas. Hierva tam-la leche.

Los alimentos también pueden transportar rtes. Pató jenas Proteja los alumentos.

En ocasiones intervienen los insectos Por ejemplo, una mosca es capaz de cargar hasta diez millones de microbios Y al pasarse en el cuerpo del niño, o en el tere, o en los fumeres, los infecta. El mosquito Aedes Eegypti puede trasmuter la fiebre amarilla. Otros animales como el perro y el cata pueden trasmatir la rabia.

Sobre un posible retorno a Cuba, el Dr. Pons respondió: "Pienso volver en un plazo muych breve. Sobre esto he hablado con el Viceministro y el Ministro del MINSAP y creo que he comos legado a un acuerdo".

Gentlemen:

We have received your check for $1,923.75 in payment of Invoice #1389 covering a reduced billing for three broadcasts per week from November 16 to November 30.

However, since we carried, at your request, 6 broadcasts per week for this period, we sent a supplemental Invoice #1389 for $607.50 to cover these additional broadcasts.

Since we have also received payment for your December Invoice #1399, we wonder if you have misplaced Invoice #1389 covering the additional broadcasts for November.

Enclosed is a copy of Invoice #1389 along with your February Invoice.

Gentlemen:

We have received your check for $1,923.75 in payment of Invoice #1382 covering a reduced billing for three broadcasts per week from November ló to November 30.

However, since we carried, at your request, 6 broadcasts per week for this period, we sent a supplemental Invoice #1389 for $607.50 to cover these additional broadcasts.

Since we have also received payment for your December Invoice #1399, we wonder if you have misplaced Invoice #1339 covering the additional broadcasts for November.

Enclosed is a copy of Invoice #1389 along with your February Invoice.

Very truly yours,

Dear Mr. Brent,

Under the terms of our agreement with you, we hereby wish to advise you that beginning 1 December 1964 we desire to reduce the number of the "Medico y Usted" broadcasts from six per week to three per week. If possible we would like to retain the Monday, Wednesday and Friday time slots. If this is not possible, our second preference would be for a Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday schedule.

Thank you very much for your cooperation in this matter and we look forward to continued collaboration with you in these matters of mutual interest.

Sincerely yours,

(OMA)

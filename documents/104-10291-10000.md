3. In the DDP Mr. Fox first served in Vietnam Operations in Headquarters and then from 1964-1966 in Saigon. There he performed affectively in both liatson and unilateral operations with elements of the Vietnamese police. He personally recruited several agents and established a successful nail intercept unit. He was first recommended for promotion to G5-13 during his Vietnam tour.

4. In November 1966 Mr. Fox joined FE/PMI. first on the Indonesian and currently on the Philippine Desk. He has served as the Indonesia Desk and Branch referent for Communist Party Operations. where he proved himself to be an excellent analyst.

30 January 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR: FE Career Management Committee

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion from GS-12 to GS-13 of Mr. Jerome Fox

1. This office wishes to reiterate its previous endorsement of the Saigon Station's recommendation for the promotion of Mr. Fox from GS-12 to GS-13.

2. Mr. Fox was initially assigned to the Indonesian Desk as an Operations Officer responsible for Headquarters support of the Djakarta Station's Communist Party Operations Program. This was a demanding task requiring sound operational judgment, experience, and the capacity to absorb large quantities of operational data and information. Despite no prior background in Indonesia, Mr. Fox quickly got on top of the material and projects and made a valuable contribution. He also had other duties concerned with support for other Station unilateral activity.

3. Mr. Fox was subsequently assigned to the Philippines Desk in preparation for an assignment to the Philippines as chief of a separate field unit in Cebu. His work on the Philippines Desk in support of Manila Station operations was also marked by a high degree of professionalism and competence.

4. Mr. Fox is a capable and experienced Operations Officer. He has proven in Vietnam a unique ability to develop valuable operational assets (he was the case officer charged with sensitive contacts with the Vietcong), and his work in this branch has been excellent. In view of this good record of productivity, and as a stimulus for future development, I strongly recommend that Mr. Fox be promoted to GS-13.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CEFO/Branch C

SUBJECT: Mr. Jerome Fox, Request for Reassignment from DOI/ORR to FE/VCL

1. The FE Division requests that arrangements be made with the DOI/ORR for the reassignment of Mr. Jerome Fox, GS-12, to the VCL Branch to work on the recently approved North Vietnam program. The Vietnam Desk of VCL has a requirement for an officer to devote full time to the collection, collation and evaluation of material available on North Vietnam. This material, once assembled, will be used as a basis for both paramilitary and psychological warfare operations to be mounted against North Vietnam. It is felt that Mr. Fox is particularly qualified for this assignment with his excellent background as a research officer and the experience gained on his Far East assignment in 1959-62. The knowledge he gained at that time of covert operations in relation to his DOI responsibilities will be helpful to him in the work envisioned for him in FE/VCL. Mr. Fox has traveled in Southeast Asia and also dealt with North Vietnam as an operational target during his military service 1952-54.

2. It is our understanding that Mr. Fox is available for reassignment. He has been interviewed by Division officers who feel his assignment would satisfy an important requirement on this priority program. It is requested that his assignment to FE/VCL, without a change in Service Designation, be arranged with DOI for approximately one year. At the end of that time, based on a review of Mr. Fox's capabilities and interest in relation to a permanent FE assignment, the possibilities of a change of service designation would be explored.

It is neither feasible nor desirable to attempt an evaluation of Mr. Fox's performance as an operations officer based on the relatively short period (5 months) he has been assigned to the Korean Desk. Throughout this time he has been faced by a series of medical and personal problems which have understandably pre-occupied him. His medical problem, which causes him almost constant pain, has led him to apply for disability retirement; a decision on his application is pending. He has also had to undergo a series of family problems which required a great deal of time and attention. Under the circumstances no specific duties and letter grades are being listed in Section B above.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

As the Station narcotics referent, Subject has continued to concentrate his efforts on developing our drug field collection capability. The penchant for detailed analysis that earlier made him an authority on Communist Party affairs has served him well in the past year in building the Station canon of knowledge on narcotics matters. He has successfully recruited the head of a private organization concerned with addict rehabilitation and drug abuse prevention. Because of his proximity to the drug world, this agent serves as a rich source of background data and as a spotter. In the latter role he has produced two individuals whom Subject has recruited as intelligence sources. One, the estranged wife of a narcotics wholesaler who, at one time was engaged in international trafficking. The other is a chemist formerly employed unwittingly, on a part time basis, by a suspected drug syndicate. The latter source is, at this writing, once again on the fringe of involvement with a group that apparently wants to use her as a courier on a one-shot basis and later utilize her professional skills in their laboratory.

Subject is the Station representative on Mission narcotics affairs and the focal point for the Mission Narcotics Intelligence Sub-Committee. He provides the day-to-day liaison with the regional DEA office. Liaison with the Philippine enforcement services, while largely the realm of DEA, provided Subject an opportunity to recruit unilaterally one of the country's leading experts in narcotics enforcement after he was chosen

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Subject has completed his second tour of duty at this Station. Looking back over his record of accomplishments, one will find a number of good achievements, but when they are all added up and measured against four years at the Station the sum falls short of what I believe he was capable of producing and should have produced. The promise that he showed during the early part of his tour never really materialized. He can and does work hard at his assignment, but he is unable to apportion his time; He can analyze an operational situation well, but cannot express the analysis lucidly in writing without a great deal of effort and re-writing. In fairness to the Subject it should be noted that during a part of this

for a multi-national advisory role abroad. A turnover was made to a TDY BKHERALD officer from the country concerned prior to the expert's departure from the Philippines.

Because of the profusion of various U.S. intelligence groups in-country, PBRAMPART and related business is a very lively and time consuming activity. He has coordinated and monitored the activity, maintaining the while good and forthcoming working relationships with his counterparts.

A Muslim source, whom he recruited, has been sent on regular trips into his home province now an embattled area in the insurgency and has become a regular producer on Muslim attitudes and plans. He enjoys access as well to Muslims resident in the Manila area and to travellers from the southern Philippines.

Subject is an intelligent, experienced officer with a wide knowledge of the entire Philippine scene, its participants and their pecking order. He is a quick and ready source of the details of the history of recent years and he has extensive knowledge of where many of the more important bodies are buried. He maintains a wide variety of disparate contacts that enable him to maintain a detached perspective. It may be, however, that a degree of staleness is affecting his performance and four years has been too long a tour. A recurring problem, an attempt to do too much at one time, continues to mar his performance; over time, this has been the subject of discussions with him. Because of his inability to establish correct priorities for himself, he often expends his extensive energies on incidentals at the expense of the important. This is an unfortunate failing for under the pressure of inexorable deadlines, clarity and detail suffer in his operational correspondence and, in general, hệ hides his considerable light under a bushel of his own making.

calendar year he was plagued with both health and personal problems that diverted him from the work at hand.

Subject has spent almost seven consecutive years on Philippine affairs, at Has and in the field. In Subject's case I believe this has worked to his disadvantage. He is "burned out" on the Philippines.

The rating officer has been fair and objective in his assessment of Subject's performance for the period covered by this fitness report. Subject's performance came to my attention daily.

In keeping with our growing national concern for worldwide narcotics production and traffic, the Station reallocated personnel, resources and priorities in order to learn the nature of the Philippine role in this illicit activity. Subject was assigned, halfway through this reporting period, as Station referent with as his primary responsibility the coordination of all of our efforts in the narcotics field. One other officer has been assigned full time to assist him.

Subject began, starting literally from scratch, by surveying the entire mission and the military bases to learn what on-going activity already existed and what areas of the problem the various civilian and military agencies considered to be of prime concern. He established an intelligence sub-committee of the mission narcotics group and set the guidelines for inter-agency intelligence coordination and established a common source registry. A great amount of missionary work has been necessary on his part, even among the professionals in the drug field, differentiating enforcement considerations from those of pure intelligence. He has established good working relationships with the concerned mission elements, concentrating primarily, of course, on liaison and support arrangements with the LNAGON representatives; the latter, during this period, moved their regional office to Manila expanding greatly (Continued)

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

There is no question in my mind that Subject has ability. What he lacks is the capacity to organize himself and his work. The result is that his performance is very uneven. This deficiency has been brought to Subject's attention on several occasions in the past 30 months. He recognizes it, but has been unable, in my opinion, to overcome it finally. This limits his usefulness at a small or medium sized Station where perforse an officer must be able to handle competently a number of disparate matters simultaneously. His written work continues to fall short of the level one should be able to expect from an officer of his grade and experience. It is (continued)

their noed for our support.

Subject, at the same time, surveyed the host government intelligence and enforcement agencies to learn how they had structured their responsibilities in combating the narcotics trade. By seeking out current and former liaison contacts, the picture that he received of the estimated size of the problem and the Philippine control effort gave us some idea of the parameters of what it was we were dealing with. Through a formerly dormant liaison contact, one of the country's experts on narcotics, he has developed both a window on what is being done officially and a means of access capable of affecting the Philippine policy on the subject. During a recent regional ASEAN meeting on narcotics held in Manila, Subject was able to insure that our objectives for the conference were met through this influential asset.

Subject has made a fine beginning in getting our narcotics effort underway. He has done the basic research, begun building the necessary data base and has culled from other activities three or four Station assets whose natural access is being utilized to develop leads into the murky Philippine underworld. His flair for organizing disparate data is being put to excellent use.

In the earlier period covered in this fitness report, Subject was plagued by a nasty, debilitating fever that eluded diagnosis for some time. A period of hospitalization followed by the necessary recuperative period kept him out of action for a lengthy period.. Close on its heels, this was compounded by a freak bone break in his hand that required surgery and once again kept him off the active list.

Subject is a good agent handler; he is both Fl and CF minded and he has the ability to ask the right questions to extract the maximum information from his sources. He has a great deal of energy and he liberally expends it in his work. This strength, curiously, is also a weakness since he has the tendency to ride off in all directions at once. In this flurry of activity, by attempting to do everything at the same time, his writing tends to become a shorthand of sorts and clarity inevitably suffers. He is aware of theso problems and has consciously made the effort part ticulary since he has become the narcotics referent -- to give proper order to his priorities.

As has been mentioned previously, his knowledge of the Communist Party activities and personnel is impressive and until he relinquished his role as the Communist Party referent, he was a helpful focal point for other Station officers with party assets. In the months ahead his concentrated efforts against the narcotics target should bear fruit.

because of these shortcomings that I would rate him in the overall sense as Proficient. We get the results we want from him, but we have to push fairly hard. Comments made in earlier Fitness Reports regarding Subject's expertise in local Communist Party matters continues to apply. He is indeed a walking encyclopedia on local party matters and shows considerable acuity in his analyses of the party. Subject's work comes to my attention on the average of five to six times a week.

This report covers a period of four months. There was no change in the substance of Subject's duties - merely a re-ordering of the priorities. Specific duty number four was elevated to the second priority. While we cannot cite any specific accomplishments yet in the performance of this second priority, we can say, in all honesty, that Subject is making a determined effort to achieve results. He is allocating his time in accordance with priorities and meeting deadlines. Comments I made in earlier fitness reports on his qualities as an agent handler, recruiter and "guru" of the Philippine Communist movement continue to apply.

Concur with comments made by the supervisor. Mr. Fox is an overall proficient case officer with some very strong talents, particularly in the Communist and CI field. He lacks supervisory experience and his talents in this regard are uncertain. Nonetheless, he does render a creditable service to the organization and is a responsible and dedicated employee. In order to determine if he has the potential for further advancement, he should be given some supervisory responsibilities to evaluate his talents in this area.

The Fitness Report of the previous period continues generally to apply during this rating period of seven months. Subject was on home leave for about one month during the period.

Subject continued to handle until his home leave in May 1971 two agent penetrations in the decision making level of the Moscow oriented communist movement. They have since been turned over to another officer for handling. Also, Subject continued to handle the Muslim agent recruited during the previous period but the Agent's performance has been marginal. In July 1971, Subject recruited a former Philippine intelligence officer who was connected with the two agent penetrations cited above. The primary purpose of this recruitment was to increase the Station's control and equity over the two agents and, as a by-product, to obtain intelligence on the communist movements. During July four developmental cases, all intelligence producers (including documentary), were turned over to Subject for continued development towards recruitment. One has unique access in the student movement, mainly in the Greater Manila area but also in the main provincial cities; another is an experienced officer of a civilian law enforcement agency who collaborated unilaterally with the Station; the other two are senior intelligence officers who have unofficially passed intelligence information.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I would characterize Subject as a competent, hard working case officer who can both handle cases and recruit new assets and who is capable of an even better performance than that reflected in this fitness report, if he could only organize himself. He knows his subject, communisa in the Philippines, better perhaps than the majority of the Filipino communists. This is a mixed blessing, however, because he is so easily distracted pursuing obscure historical points, not really relevant to the conduct of operations, that occasionally he finds himself behind schedule in meeting levled requirements. I have taken him out of communist operations as such except in his capacity as the "referent"

NARRATIVE (Continued)

Referent for Communist Matters in an excellent fashion. He has a thorough knowledge of the communist situation in the Philippines and can provide briefings on any aspect of it. Subject has made meaningful comments on the communist penetration operations of other officers advising them on vulnerabilities and suggesting approaches for greater exploitation of these assets. His briefings are well prepared and he delivers them fully and persuasively. During this rating period, Subject was the most aggressive and effective of the three "Referents", who are senior operations officers responsible for the main operational targets of the Station.

Subject has continued to be an effective agent handler. He motivates them and applies discipline without destroying initiative. He has directed them to collect difficult intelligence information, which has been of high value in planning and assessing future opera- tions. Headquarters grades to Subject's intelligence disseminations from the two communist penetration agents above attest to Subject's competence in extracting and preparing intelligence disseminations.

While Subject has performed well as a Referent and agent handler, he has not done as well in the priority area of acquiring fresh assets in the unilateral and liaison penetration fields. This requirement has been spelled out in his Letter of Instructions (LOI), discussed by COS in the weekly operations staff meetings and daily Referent meetings, and in separate consultations with COS and DCOS. It is not that Subject dislikes contacting new people or contacting Filipinos; to the contrary, Subject has a warm, natural, and sincere approach in meeting Filipinos. Initial contacts are made with potential assets but there is a lack of planned and systematic follow through that all developmental cases require. Subject keeps himself busy throughout the day and his workday at the office normally begins at 0730 hours. He is no slouch when it comes to work and he appears to gravitate to it. His attitude and efforts in a recent highly sensitive Station operation were commendable. Subject is at his best in ad hoc duties: he sizes up a problem quickly, discusses his operational plan with COS/DCOS, and proceeds at once to implement it. Intelligence product derived from such operations are well written and meaningful; operational reports are thoughtful and thorough. His total work load described above is no heavier than any other officer at this Station. The Station of the '70's is lean on personnel and heavy on responsibilities, Since there appears to be no relaxation of the latter and the trend is further personnel reduction, not increase of personnel, operations officers will have to trim excess corners.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 125

SECRET

NARRATIVE (Continued)

In my opinion, Subject's basic weakness, which was pointed out in the previous Fitness Report, continues to be his inability to budget his time to handle the priorities as established by COS/DCOS as well as by himself. Subject spends considerable time on a given matter of the moment and has great power of concentration on a single problem. These are attributes many wish they possess, but at the same time they impede the efficiency of an operations officer with numerous high priority duties. Unless he can budget his time by discriminating against the low priority or non-priority matters and focus on maintaining a balanced portfolio of contact and staff responsibilities, I believe his further development into the well-rounded senior officer would be impaired. Subject has made a determined effort to correct the above weakness including the submission of paper work by the deadline. By the end of the rating period, there has been favorable progress. I am confident he can overcome completely this area of weakness by exercising the same discipline he uses in executing duties #1 and #3.

Above all, Subject tries to excell and he works extremely hard. I believe that Subject has the potential capability to progress to more responsible positions in the operations and management fields: he has sound operational judgment, he is cooperative and responsive, he works well with and has the confidence of people he deals with, and he has a good feel for the Station's total aims and capabilities.

Subject was given an overall Strong in view of his vigorous and successful prosecution of the two important duties, his determined effort to overcome the weakness cited above, and his potential capability for continued growth in the management and operational fields.

Subject has responsibility for the Station's communist penetration project. Ile has budgeted his funds realistically and has spent it on operations which have brought good results.

REVIEWING COMMENTS (continued)

for the subject, assigned him other responsibilities and given him strict deadlines in the hope that he will get organized. He is an above average officer who could do a lot better. His work comes to my attention on a daily basis. The rating officer is known to me to be a fair and objective rater. In this case, however, I disagree with the overall rating of Strong, because potential of this officer notwithstanding, he has not performed overall at that level. Both the Subject and the rating officer are aware of my views and both have read the foregoing comments. I believe the overall grade should be PROFICIENT.

Beginning in early July 1970 a new Staff operational policy was enunciated. It emphasized the thorough operational and security assignment of on-going cases and the acquisition of new agents in various priority fields. In early August the Station was reorganized and Subject was appointed as the Referent for Communist Matters (Duty 2), the highest priority area in our Operating Directive. This responsibility, plus other equally important priority of acquiring high grade agents in the communist movement and the Philippine Security Services, was incorporated in Subject's revised Letter of Instructions (LOI) later in the year.

Subject has demonstrated a keen grasp of the details of the communist movements. He has developed a thorough knowledge of the leaders, their inter relationships, personal background, strengths and weaknesses. At the same time he has kept current on the many front organizations. As Referent for Communist Matters, Subject has at his disposal the utilization of all Case Officers under official and non official cover to prosecute, as noted above, the Station's number one priority. While he has no command responsibility, he has been granted considerable latitude in the coordinative, creative, reporting, and project management role. Subject has used his knowledge effectively by providing staff advice to Case Officers, spotting new leads, approaches, and

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

The rating officer has done well in describing this officer's strengths and weaknesses. He is an effective team member, a perceptive student of the communist movement and a thorough agent handler. He knows the craft and practices it carefully. He is an officer on whom I can depend to handle well assignments involving people without need for close supervision. He now is in a position that will allow him to demonstrate leadership abilities and I believe he will acquit himself well. Compared to other officers of the same grade known to me, I would place Subject well above the Average. He has the potential for further growth given the opportunity.

opportunities; suggesting new targots; sharpening the focus of going cases; assisting in the pruning of marginal assets; briefing visiting officials and Our Government's officials assigned to the Philippines; writing assessments and target analysis; and review-ing Station's total efforts against the communist movements.

To achieve a tighter control and monitor of the Station efforts against the communist movements, Subject submitted a comprehensive project proposal to Headquarters. Responses of Case Officers to Subject's assistance have been favorable and productive. He has a friendly and easy way that exudes confidence and he has been generous with his time to those who solicit it to discuss patters related to his responsibilities.

Subject has handled his on-going cases very professionally. Two agents, who operate as a team, wore acquired from a friendly service earlier in the your and they represent our deepest penetration in the pro Moscow communist movement in the Philippines. Between then we are provided with key information as to the Hovement's policy, plans, and organization. During this period Subject has formally recruited a Muslim who was spotted and developed by a previous Case Officer. The asset was subjected to a technical examination and has since been a reporting source on matters pertaining to the Muslim minority problem in thô Philippines, He is a potential asset to use against our Soviot Bloc operations. Subject_has handled-a-liaison-official who has agreed to share his cases with the Station. In addition to receiving positivo intelligence on communist, matters, Subject has been attempting to make this official a truly suborned liaison asset to provide counterintelligence Information as well. Subject has conducted a thorough assessment of a second liatson collaborator and subjected him to two technical interviews which resulted in his termination. He had provided sensitive documentary intelligence; however, the factors suggesting termination were overriding. Subject has handled the Manila end of a complicated communist netration case with results that have impressed Headquarters and a third Station. Subject served as the first Case Officer of an asset turned over to the Station by liaison. Subject conducted a thorough assessment of this asset's capability and subsequently trained, motivated, and handled him effectively before turning

him over to another Case Officer. He has shown thorough knowledge of his cases, exercised tradecraft, and sound operational practices and judgment in his contact procedures; displayed inventiveness in extracting maximum information and at the same time motivating the assets; and has shown that he has full command of the assets.

Subject is well prepared for his meetings and is a thorough debriefer.

While Subject is an excellent agent handler he has not done as well in the higher priority agent acquisition field. Perhaps he has not yet achieved his stride to contact communist targets either directly or through the recruitment of principal agents. With his excollont knowledge of the communist targets, it would appear that he should theoretically bo the most aggressive in the agent acquisition field. I still have hope that there will be an operational breakthrough in this vital sector by this potentially capable officer. Of somewhat lower priority than the above, Subject like all other declared officers has also been tasked with the job or penetrating the security services for positive and counterintelligence information. He has acquired several liaison contacts from his prodecossor and while one of them is being met regularly there has been no appreciable increase as yet in the number of developmentals in this area.

Subject is a "team player" who has demonstrated high dedication and integrity; his intelligence-disseminations and operational correspondence shows that he has a firm grasp of the Station's mission; he is sensitive to information that must be brought to the attention of COS/DCOS and communicates such information promptly. Subject responds to requests for advice and discussions from various quarters in an enthusiastic fashion and gives his time freely and constructively; While the latter is one of Subject's greatest strongths, it is at the same time a main contributory factor to his woakness, I believo. Subject is not as rapid as he should bo in meeting deadlines and he had to be prodded to get his operational correspondence and also administrative requirements, such as accountings, to the concerned offices. It should bo stated, however, that when theso papers aro submitted they are well done and clearly thought out. I believe this weakness which could bo corrected easily with filmor personal discipline, is a main inhibiting factor to his assumption of a position that requires minimal supervision. Subject and COS/DCOS have daily consultations

and Subject has been encouraged to budget his time so that his main priorities can be accomplished in a balanced keel. Consultations have been in a constructive vein and Subject has responded favorably. Subject has the willing attitude, sustained interest, aggressiveness, and professional competence to potentially excel further to assume more senior operational and management responsibilities. Subject has no cover responsibilities.

Subject budgets his funds realistically and spends them wisely and with good impact. At the same time he is economy minded in the use of Government equipment.

No substantive change from previous Fitness Report. The comments therein remain essentially valid. Subject will be acting capacity covering in the main the current supervisor's functional responsibilities for an interim period of over two months. Through a deliberately imposed trial period in preparation for this change, Subject has moved in strongly and with good judgment. The variation in Rating Letter grades reflects the longer period of assessment. Subject has improved demonstrably in approaches and initiative under Specific Duty No. 3; under Specific Duty No. 6 the current Supervisor has noted a tendency to be less than prompt in finalizing support actions so vital to liaison as such and our own support elements; finally, the present Supervisor finds room for improvement in the conduct of intra-Station relationships, but this is admittedly a highly subjective view. There remains no question about overall professionalism and capabilities.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

The reviewing comments made in the previous fitness report continue to apply for this brief rating period. For the same reasons stated therein, I would rate Subject in Duty #1 as Proficient and the overall grade of Proficient. Duty #1 is Subject's principal function assigned in his Letter of Instruction (LOI). During the past two weeks and for a two week period in mid April when Subject managed the Communist Operations Branch and his cases all by himself, I have observed a distinct increase in his effectiveness. He has worked long and hard, has shown initiative and imagination, has kept DCOS/COS currently briefed, and has shown good judgment in the decisions he

made and recommendations referred to DCOS/COS, Subject has been encouraged to continue to exploit these strengths, as woll as to oxpedite the preparation of written reports as noted by the Rating Officer. I have no doubt that Subject can and will exploit his potential to the maximum capacity during the next rating period in order to increase his rating, his comparative standing among the Station's other GS-13 officers, and to fulfill more thoroughly the priorities in his LOI.

Subject arrived at Station in May 1969 well prepared and took over from his predecessor in an organized and professional manner; there were no hitches, either in terms of personality conflicts or operational lag. He has since continued to demonstrate care in preparation and approach to what is a demanding and highly varied assignment; he "uses" his past experience with originality and selective aggressiveness, and more important, with a keen sense of adaptability to his operational environment. Subject is definitely not a clock-watcher and gives of his own time freely and at his own initiative. Subject's initiative in developing new assets/operations is limited only by the broad scope of duties already assigned.

Section B Specific Duties are directly related to Subject's Letter of Instruction dated 26 May 1969. In discharging his responsibilities as MPWATCH referent, which includes advice and guidance to other Mission intelligence components in addition to Station officers, Subject is limited only by the extent to which he is called on; he himself is thoroughly grounded and available for the discharge of this function. He has handled one existing and very sensitive coopted liaison asset in excellent fashion and is developing a second such asset into a unilateral role; based on qualifications and experience, he can do more in this area and in the unilateral field generally, even given an already restrictive time schedule. In a rapidly changing operational atmosphere, /continued --/

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Concur generally with ratings and narrative comments. Subject is a dedicated, responsive and methodical officer whose previous duty Station was Headquarters Philippine Desk. In a relatively brief period of time Subject has obtained a good knowledge of the MPWATCH situation and operational information. Probably because of the presence of knowledgeable senior ops officers at the Station, Subject has been somewhat reserved in executing his assigned responsibility as MPWATCH functional officer. I believe Subject could have been more vigorous in this primary area of responsibility. This may change when these officers are rotated this spring and summer. This matter has been discussed with Subject by COS/DCOS and encouraged him to assume a more aggressive and substantive.

SECTION C /continued --/

not necessarily conducive to easier relationships with local counterparts, Subject handles himself with professionalism, tact and understanding, well designed to absorb increasing sensitivities and still get the job done. Operational and performance consultations are held constantly -- daily on specifics and at least weekly on detailed performance and operational objectives. These sessions are frank and Subject is as much contributor as receiver, but he is distinctly receptive to realistic supervision and guidance for operational continuity. Subject is markedly security conscious, maintains his covor status as appropriate and is perhaps overly cost conscious. His work in analysis and research in the complex MPWATCH field, bringing together and collating viably positive intolligence (which otherwise bo lost) in draft form is exemplary; his finished written work requires and is getting continuing attention. In fairness to Subject on latter point, he does very well in this area when adequate time is available to "finish" the product; on balance we prefer him active and mobile and can live with this marginal fault while evidont efforts to improve continue. Overall, Subject is a well-rounded operations officer, a credit to the Agency and capable of larger responsibilities.

role in suggesting operational ideas, levying tailored intelligence requirements, etc, to the various ops officer. Accordingly, for this rating period, I would rate Subject in Duty #1 at Proficient with an over-all rating of Proficient. Subject has the potential to increase his capability in the operations and ops management spheres. Subject and his rating officer work effectively as a team; consultations between them have produced, some positive results.

During the reporting period Mr. Fox has assumed greater responsibility as an Acting Desk Chief. As such he is responsible for the support of the operations of a large and active Station and for the direction of some eight employees either serving on this Desk or in process for the field. On balance he has done extremely well. His ability to express himself well verbally or in writing has stood him in good stead. His operational judgment is extremely good. He gets along well with his subordinates, delegates to them, and has obtained good production from them. He is highly cost conscious.

He has made progress in speeding up the preparation of his written material. After serving with him for some two years the undersigned is convinced that Mr. Fox has considerable potential for further advancement as a manager and operations officer.

### NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position looping to proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the way of personnel, space, equipment and funds must be commented on. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

Mr. Fox is a bright, energetic and capable officer. At the same time, he is professionally sound in his judgement. He is thorough in reviewing and evaluating his programs and has a superior knowledge of his subject matter. He is cost conscious. During the past year he has handled a very large work load. While his general performance has been exemplary, there have been, at times inordinate delays in completing a proportion of his written work, accounting, etc. Mr. Fox has been cautioned in his written work, accounting, etc. Mr. Fox has been cautioned in his occasionally erratic performance, and it is expected that he will show marked improvement.

This officer is scheduled for assignment to the Philippines in mid-1969. His operational work in Hqs in handling visiting unilateral and liaison assets, as well as local developmentals argue well for a fine performance in the field. He is an extremely personable individual, who while intense does very well in social situations. He is a self starter, who needs little guidance. These factors should stand him in good stead.

In spite of occasional delays noted above, Mr. Fox was a very strong asset for the Philippine Desk during the past year. He remains a most capable officer with considerable potential career development.

Mr. Fox is a thoroughly competent case officer who has been a major asset to the Philippine Desk. He has worked extremely hard with a minimum of supervision. He has not limited himself to his assigned duties, but has interested himself in other aspects of the Desk. In this regard he contributed considerably to the complete reorganization of the desk files.

In carrying out his duties he has been extremely thorough. His analysis of his cases has been excellent. While he writes clearly and meaningfully he still tends to be slow in handling correspondence. He will have to pay extra attention to this in his coming assignment as a Chief of a one-man base.

Mr. Fox is personable intelligent, and mature officer. He is a self starter who should do extremely well in his upcoming assignment.

Mr. Fox has had no supervisory responsibilities during the period under review. He is commendably cost-conscious.

COMMENTS OF REVIEING OFFICIAL I concur with the Rating Officer's evaluations and comments.

Prior to his assignment to the Philippines Desk Mr. Fox served under me on the Indonesia Desk. While there he mastered with commendable speed a variety of complex operational matters and related subjects of interest. He could always be counted on to know his cases and come up with the facts. He is a sound professional who can be trusted to do a job with a minimum of supervision.

In view of his excellent performance since his assignment to this Branch, Mr. Fox has been recommended for promotion to GS-13. He is also being programmed for an assignment as Chief of a facility in Cebu where his independence and self-reliance should stand him in good stead.

Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

The comments noted in Mr. Fox's previous Fitness Report to the effect that a little more experience with the Indonesian Desk (to which he was assigned in mid-October 1963) should make him a strong member have been more than amply justified during this period. With minimum supervision or direction, Mr. Fox undertook the task of absorbing and systemitizing the complexities of Djakarta Station operations against communists and other left-wing elements. The result has been increased comprehension on the part of Headquarters regarding these efforts.

Mr. Fox also contributed materially in the way of preliminary operational research, support, recommendations and follow-through on two operational ploys conducted by Headquarters: one, an attempted recruitment of a communist functionary in a third country; and the other the turnover of a former Djakarta Station asset now in the U.S. to another agency. Mr. Fox was further involved in studies to determine the feasibility of capitalizing on other agency assets for entrees to the communist movement not only in Indonesia but also the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore. Ilis performance in these functions was characterized by thoroughness and imagination.

Mr. Fox is an extremely capable, inteligent officer with whom it is a genuine pleasure to serve, both professionally and personally. He is intellectually (Continued)

I would have rated Mr. Fox about the same. He at times suffers from an inability to articulate his thoughts clearly. There is no question of his professional grasp of his field, however, Ilis feel for CP penetration operations is unusually sharp and he is capable of playing a significant ops role in a field assignment.

curious, has a probing mind and has the knack of quickly and accurately assessing a given situation. A diligent worker, he retains a good sense of humor and gets along well with his colleagues. He is inclined to become a bit Impatient with the bureaucratic procedures at Headquarters, but has the maturity to subdue such feelings in the interests of expediency.

As for weak points, Mr. Fox has tended to be somewhat lax about answering correspondence, particularly when he felt them to be of marginal value. This has been pointed out to him, however, and he is effectively overcoming this defect.

During this period, Mr. Fox had no supervisory duties as such, although he assisted on an ad hoc basis in the supervision of a career trainee temporarily assigned to the Indonesian Desk. His performance here was promising and it is contemplated to assign him some supervisory responsibilities in the future.

Mr. Fox exhibits good cost consciousness.

JAN 13 3:22 PM '67

Subject has been assigned to the Indonesia Desk since mid-
October 1966, consequently evaluation of performance of specific
duties at this point would not be based upon representative
evidence.

During the very brief interval Subject has been with the
desk, he has shown several consistent qualities that deserve
noting. Assigned the Communist Party operations sector, he
applied himself to background reading, files research and
organizing his materials, with commendable energy. He has
accepted a variety of spot assignments requiring timely res-
ponse, shown considerable initiative in locating the necessary
facts, and met the required deadlines without undue assistance
or observation. He shows every evidence of absorption in his
assigned field. A little more experience with the country,
Headquarters procedures and local conventions should make him
a strong member of the desk.

LANGUAGE TRAINING OBJECTIVES AND METHODS

The general aims of language training are attainment of proficiency in speaking, understanding, reading and writing. The specific objectives are: (1) ability to produce and distinguish the sounds of the language; (2) ability to use a stock of basic sentences and expressions; (3) ability to recombine the elements of basic sentences and expressions and to apply them to new situations; (4) ability to comprehend the language spoken at normal speed in various situations; (5) ability to write and read the language commensurate with ability to speak.

Methods used in all courses stress oral drills and free conversation based at first on memorized material and, at a later stage, on varied reading materials. Written and oral tests are given at intervals. Listening to and recording on tapes in the Language Lab is essential for class preparation.

During the period covered by this report, Mr. 148 169 1664 time been assigned as an operations officer in the DD/P, having transferred from the DD/i in April 1963. Mr. Fox has made this transition very well and has adjusted himself to the operating tempo and atmosphere of a busy desk. He is now a competent and flexible case officer, making a valuable contribution to his desk and branch. For the past month, he has served very capably as acting chief of the North Vietnam element of the desk, during the absence of another officer.

Mr. Fox was quick to recognize the difference between his present assignment and those previous to it. This difference has required some changes on his part, in terms of emphasis and flexibility. Mr. Fox has graciously accepted guidance given him during this period, and has developed into an efficient DD/P officer.

Mr. Fox's assignment involves partial supervision of two junior officers. He directs these officers effectively, and in a natural manner, giving promise of considerable supervisory capability which future assignments can develop.

Following some additional time on the desk, during which time it is expected that Mr. Fox will assume more responsibility for the North Vietnam program, it is planned to send him to the field, as his performance on the desk would indicate that he is fully capable of an operational field assignment.

Mr. Fox's supervisory duties have not been directly related to fiscal matters. However, he has revealed a normal degree of cost consciousness in those budgetary matters with which he has come in contact.

Concur in supervisor's comments. I have observed this officer since early May 1963 and I believe he has developed steadily in the operations field, a field new to him. After another six to nine months on the desk, he should be ready for his first ops assignment abroad, hopefully in Saigon working on the North Vietnam program. He is showing the earmarks of a well-rounded, thoughtful case officer and we should not delay too long in getting him to the field in a real operational situation.

Subject during his tour of duty at this station demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the Factory Markings program and was sincere and competent in performing his duties. The establishment of the joint center (Comet) was a creditable achievement which should make an important contribution to the program in the years to come. He was cooperative and willing to undertake additional duties when requested. He has done an outstanding job in the training of both ODYOKE and foreign personnel.

The reporting officer feels that Subject has a tendency to procrastinate and that on a few occasions he did not follow through on his commitments as aggressively as he might have. This, however, was the only weakness noticed in an otherwise competent performance.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described; if applicable.

During the period covered by this report, Mr. Fox has for the first time been assigned as an operations officer in the DD/P, having transferred from the DD/I in April 1963. Mr. Fox has made this transition very well, and has adjusted himself to the operating tempo and atmosphere of a busy desk. He is now a competent and flexible case officer, making a valuable contribution to his desk and branch. For the past mooth, he has served very capably as acting chief of the North Vietnam element of the desk, during the absence of another officer.

Mr. Fox was quick to recognize the difference between his present assignment and those previous to it. This difference has required some changes on his part, In terms of emphasis and flexibility. Mr. Fox has graciously accepted guidance given him during this period, and has developed into an efficient DD/P officer.

Mr. Fox's assignment involves partial supervision of two junior officers. Ho directs these officers effectively, and in a natural manner, giving promise of considerable supervisory capability which future assignments can develop.

Following some additional time on the desk, during which time it is expected that Mr. Fox will assume more responsibility for the North Vietnam program, it is planned to pend him to the field, as his performance on the desk would indicate that he is fully capable of an operational field assignment.

*Mr. Fox's supervisory duties have not been directly related to fiscal matters. However, he has revealed a normal degree of cost consciousness in those budgetary matters with which he has come in contact

Concur in supervisor's comments. I observed this officer since sarly May 1963 and I believe ha has developed steadily in the operations field, a field now to hira. After another six to nine months on the desk, he should be ready for his first opo assignment abroad, hopefully in Saigon working on the North Vietnam program. He is showing the earmarks of a well-rounded, thoughtful care officer and we should not delay too long in getting him to the field in a real operational situation.

SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

The undersigned's assessment of subject officer continues essentially the same as stated in the previous fitness report.

During the 18 months this officer has performed his duties at Tokyo Station he has carried on and, with marked success, built upon the program organized by his predecessor. Subject officer by diligent effort and by demonstrating outstanding competence and expertise in the Factory Marking field has successfully established himself as the focal point for the Factory Markings Collection Program (FMCP) within both the Station and the ODYOKE intelligence community. He has established and maintained excellent working relations with all ODYOKE intelligence components having an interest and/or capability in the FMCP. His status insures the maximum coordinated effort in this field with resultant benefits to the entire intelligence community. The thoroughness and effectiveness with which I believe the FMCP is being carried out in the North Asian area is strong testimonial for the caliber of subject officer's performance.

Subject officer has demonstrated high devotion to duty and complete willingness to undertake any task, no matter how difficult or inconvenient, which would contribute to the FMCP. In addition, he has voluntarily undertaken to look after the broader interests of KULYNX with both KUDOVE and ODYCZ military intelligence components in this area. In the performance of his duties subject officer has also displayed a high degree of initiative and self-reliance, as well as mature judgment in assessing the goals of his program and devising and implementing all measures necessary to achieve these.

With regard to subject officer's current assignment and performance I have no weaknesses to note. From the point of view of his career development I do recommend further training.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL I am not, of course, as familiar with Subject's work as is the rater, but I cannot help but question what I consider the extremely high ratings given here. True, we have no person performing comparable duties in the station, but we have few, if any, officers here who consistently perform at this high level. In my dealings with Subject, I have been struck by his high motivation and devotion to duty. On the other hand, I have not been favorably impressed by his failure to handle promptly his (cont'd)

## SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Mr. Fox is a steady, conscientious worker, and has consistently displayed initiative and thoroughness in his research assignments. His main weakness is in organizing and presenting the results of his work. This weakness is also apparent in his oral presentation of argumentation. Mr. Fox frequently "talks around a point" instead of "hitting the point". This weakness has influenced the rating given under Section D - "thinks clearly", and limits his effectiveness as a supervisor. It is hoped that Mr. Fox will overcome this weakness in his forthcoming assignment overseas.

REMARKS

Mr. Fox met the course objectives and completed all of the course assignments for the two weeks he attended with average results.

Encountering some difficulty at the outset, Mr. Fox soon overcame many of his problems. He checked out in and only camera equipment, but other equipment as well. He also offered to complete additional assignments on his own time.

It is suggested he continue his practice and association with photography in order to maintain and improve present proficiency.

SECTION 11: OBJECTIVES OF THE CURSE

1.  To introduce students to the skills and methods involved in the processing of intelligence materials
2.  To provide practice in the oral and written presentation of intelligence for a variety of purposes.

SECTION III: SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COURSE

Intelligence Principles and Methods is a four weeks (160 hours) extension of Basic Orientation Course for personnel who are or will be engaged in the production of intelligence. Emphasis is on "learning by doing", through the medium of a series of integrated written exercises which require processing of actual intelligence documents. Exercise is also gained in the oral presentation of Intelligence through a series of briefings before the class. Each student is assigned a special research problem for which approximately 40 hours are allotted in the course schedule. The results are presented to follow-students and instructors in an oral briefing at the close of the course. The student also prepares an annotated bibliography, and writes a critical review of one of his chief sources,

SECTION IV: HOW THE STUDENTS ARE EVALUATED

Written exercises are graded independently by at least two members of the instructional staff on the basis of how well the student has fulfilled the requirements of selectivity, orientation, accuracy to original documents, and clarity of style. Graded for each type of written exercise and rating in Section V. Oral briefings are evaluated by both instructors and fellow students through the use of written critique sheets and oral observations following each presentation. A composite grade is given for the oral briefings, in the evaluation of the research problems (knowledge of subject, intelligence focus, exploitation of sources, and general quality of the written and oral presentation. The grades are defined as follows:

SUPERIOR: The student demonstrated outstanding ability or thorough knowledge of the subject.

## Section IV. How the Students are Evaluated (Contd.)

**EXCELLENT:** The student showed unusual competence, skill or ability in meeting this objective or goal; he demonstrated a thorough grasp of the presented material, or, if skills are involved, he demonstrated that he can perform in an extremely effective manner in this area.

**SATISFACTORY:** The student met this objective in a competent and adequate manner; he demonstrated a good understanding and grasp of the information presented, or, if skills are involved, he demonstrated sufficient competence to operate effectively in this area.

**POOR:** Although the student may have met some of the standards set for minimum achievement of this course goal or objective, he demonstrated serious gaps in knowledge or sufficient lack of skill to be of doubtful competence.

**FAILURE:** The student was unable to grasp the concepts of information presented, or demonstrated that he had not acquired the necessary information and skills to operate at even minimum capacity in this area.

## SECTION V: REPORT OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT

## SECTION VII: INSTRUCTORS' COMMENTS

Observations of the instructional staff, especially on habits, characteristics, strengths, weaknesses or anything that may have influenced the student's performance in the course are reported here.

Mr. Fox's performance in the course was no more than average, but he applied himself to the work and was interested in getting something out of the instruction. Mr. Fox took "Economic Relations between Afghanistan and the USSR" as the topic for his research project and did considerable work on the subject, in spite of a dearth of material. His critical review was workmanlike and showed that he had put a definite effort into preparing it.

Mr. Fox improved throughout the course in his oral briefing, although at no time were they well organized or concise. When his faults were pointed out to him, he made a genuine attempt to remedy them. Mr. Fox also has the capability of self-criticism; he frequently recognized his mistakes himself and was interested in discussing them with his adviser. Although his performance was frequently disappointing, I believe that he obtained considerable benefit from the course as he was genuinely anxious to learn and improve.

This evaluation, shown by an "X" in one of the boxes, takes into account this training record, the student's age, grade, Agency experience, and projected assignment. It is included for the purpose of giving supervisors an estimate of the implications of the training evaluation report for the student's assignment and career potential.

READING ANALY313 PROGRAM

## OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM

1.  To determine employees' proficiency level in scanning, extensive and intensive reading tasks.
2.  To determine employees' degree of reading versatility. Versatility is defined as the ability to apply the general reading skills appropriately to various reading situations.
3.  To ascertain the probable gain which would accrue from further training in reading skills.
4.  To inform each employee concerning his relative reading proficiency in scanning, extensive and intensive reading and his versatility.

READING COMPREHENSION TESTS: Measures speed and accuracy of basic comprehension skills. Complete and objective understanding, analysis, and interpretation are required in this test.

EXTENSIVE READING TEST: Measures the degree of proficiency in informational, or general reading.

INTENSIVE READING TEST: Measure reading proficiency in acquiring basic knowledge of new subjects.

SCANNING TESTS: Measure proficiency in the organization and location of specific information, main ideas, and questions.

## ANALYSIS OF READING PERFORMANCE

|                               | Poor | Fair | Avg. | Exc. | Sup. |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

| 3. Intensive Techniques       |      | X    |      |      |      |
| 4. Scanning Techniques:       |      |      |      |      |      |
| Recall for Main Idea          |      |      | X    | X    |      |
| Quantitative                  |      |      | X    |      |      |
| Organization                  |      |      |      | X    |      |
| 5. Versatility                |      |      | X    |      |      |

## COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

Mr. Fox scans for specifics quickly and accurately; he scans for main ideas satisfactorily, but could improve his use of that technique with practice. Poorer comprehension in intensive reading could be caused by lack of concentration or failure to organize information while re-reading. Extensive reading could be improved by adjusting rate to read selectively for pertinent information. The Reading Improvement Course would be of benefit in developing use of more diversified skills.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Messrs. Jerome Fox and Harry G. Peterson -
Fourth Security Violation

REFERENCE: HR 10-10

1. This memorandum contains a recommendation for approval in paragraph 4.

2.  Two officers of this Division have incurred their fourth security violation. Reference requires that I impose at least two weeks' leave without pay in each case unless your approval is obtained for a lesser penalty. I propose such a lessor penalty and request your concurrence.

3.  The officers concerned, Messrs. Jerome Fox and Harry G. Peterson, are both dedicated Agency employees who have never, to the best of my knowledge, evidenced contempt for our security procedures nor displayed such gross negligence as to require strong remedial action. In neither case were any of the violations such as to indicate a compromise of information was probable; all were either open-safe or "exposed-classified-material" violations such as one-time typewriter ribbons, and none involved loss of documents, indiscreet talk or other more serious matters. Further, the majority of the violations occurred on occasions when the individuals concerned worked past the normal close of business and, while this is no excuse for carelessness, frequent overtime work does increase the possibility of a violation since the usual after-hours duty check is not operative. It seems to me, therefore, that the two weeks' leave without pay required by reference would be an excessively harsh penalty and not conducive to the enhancement of Agency security in general. I, therefore, propose the imposition of two days' leave without pay and a written reprimand for each officer. Copies of the proposed reprimand are attached.

MEMORANDUM FOR: FE Career Management Committee

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr. Jerome Fox from 08-12 to 08-13

1. The Vietnam Station has recommended the promotion of Mr. Jerome Fox from 08-12 to 08-13. He has been in his present grade for almost five years. He is already performing at the level normally expected of a GS-13. Mr. Fox was ranked fifth among all GS-12's currently at Vietnam Station. The Station recommendation as contained in Saigon 4925 (72709) is quoted in the following paragraphs.

2. This employee has performed at a highly commendable level during his tour at this Station. During the first year he was assigned to a variety of jobs, all of which he approached with vigor and capability. These included liaison responsibilities with both the Special Branch of the National Police and the Saigon Municipal Police. He has also engaged in unilateral agent activities; he has developed, recruited and managed two unilateral agents, and plans to attempt the recruitment of a third prior to his departure. During the last period of his duty, Subject has concentrated on the development and progress of a sensitive FI/CI activity concerned with a mail intercept. He initiated this project, and has since managed it in such a manner that it has evolved into a unilateral project with considerable potential. During the course of his tour, the case officer was also charged with the implementation of an activity designed to bring about the release of an American prisoner held by the VC. While this did not occur to fruition, Subject approached this difficult task with a reasonable degree of initiative and energy.

3. Subject displays the qualities of a highly capable, well-rounded officer. He has approached his oral tasks with a mature and efficient manner, and has always demonstrated an excellent understanding of the role and mission of HWPAC? and the Station in this area. He appears to be highly motivated, and I consider him an officer with a great deal of long-range potential.

SECURITY VIOLATION REPORT

## DETAILS OF VIOLATION:

On 9 March 1967, at 7:29 p.m., USSP Poag reported finding Safe No. D-1480 improperly secured in Room 5C-35, Headquarters Building. Security Duty Officer Craig responded and determined that:

1. both drawers were found closed but unlocked;

2. the safe was opened by merely depressing the hand latch;

3. the safe contained material classified through SECRET;

4. the char force had not been in the area prior to this discovery.

SDO Craig changed the combination and secured the safe at 8:30 p. m.

## INVESTIGATIVE FACTS:

Mr. Jerome Fox, the custodian of the safe, accepted full responsibility for this occurrence when Interviewed in his office on 10 March. Mr. Fox stated that he obviously falled to secure the safe due to the fact that he had no reason to believe anyone else would have opened it subsequent to his departure at 6:00 p.m. (NOTE: The safe was left improperly secured for approximately 90 mimmtes.) It should be noted that Mr. Fox had signed for the security check of his area.

## CONCLUSION:

In view of the above circumstances, Mr. Fox is charged with an Open Safe security violation.

## SECURITY HISTORY:

Mr. Fox has been employed by the Agency since June 1955. A review of his record indicates that ho has been previously charged with an Open Salo security violation which occurred on 28 May 1964, an Exposed Classified Materal security violation which occurred on 11 January 1966, and an Exposed Classified Material security violation which occurred on 12 May 1966.

Training Record

Instructor Training Course No. 60 6 students
40 hours, 50 days - 3 Nov. 1961

Student: Fox, Jerome Year of Birth: 1928

EOD Date: June 1955 Grade: 11 Officer: Orr/JI/FM

## COURSE OBJECTIVES, CONTENT, AND METHODS

The Objectives of this course are:

1.  To develop an acquaintance with the learning processes.

2.  To apply the principles of learning and instruction in practical teaching experiences.

This course included planning and practical teaching work in: principles of learning and teaching; effective oral communication; demonstration techniques; training aids; elements of effective class discussions; principles of lesson planning; all based upon the implementation of the principles of learning. Due to the shortness of the course, familiarization only was attempted with the above aspects of teaching.

During this course, each student presented to the class a sample speech, demonstration, a class discussion, and lesson plan, all related to his own subject matter area. These presentations were critiqued and rated by his classmates and the instructors. Over half of the students' course time was spent in practical exercises.

## ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This student has satisfactorily accomplished the course objectives and met the course standards in presenting his exercises. Mr. Fox has a pleasant manner of speaking, and with each presentation to the class his effectiveness increased. He was able to use visual aids effectively to good advantage, and he made worthwhile suggestions for improving the presentations of others. He evidenced a sound grasp of the principles of lesson plan format.

Despite his noticeable progress during the course, Mr. Fox needs to show more interest in his students and regularly maintain good eye contact with his entire class. By giving continual attention and practice to vocal variety, overt manifestations of enthusiasm, and the establishment of close rapport with the students, Mr. Fox should be able to increase considerably his competence as an instructor.

REMARKS:

For met the course objectives and completed all of the course assignments
for the two weeks he attended with average results.

Demonstrating much difficulty at the outset, Mr. Fox soon overcame many of his
problems in the two week time. He demonstrated an eagerness to learn, by asking
to be checked out in not only course equipment, but other equipment as well. He
was allowed to complete additional assignments on his own time.

It is suggested to continue his practice and association with photography
in order to maintain and improve present proficiency.

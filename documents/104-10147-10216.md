# 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

CONFIDENTIAL

OLC-78-3040
22 September 1978

MEMORANDUM FOR : Mr. Ray Reardon
Office of Security

FROM : S. D. Breckinridge

SUBJECT : Agency Employees with the Surname of Bishop

1. The Office of Personnel is gathering files of present and past employees of the Agency who were on board in the 60's. Attached are brief excerpts from the OPFs of the first group shown to me by Doris Houdesheldt.

2. I am trying to assemble a book of photographs of these different employees to show to the two witnesses who think they knew a man named Morris Bishop in the 60's. The photograph or photographs that you may have concerning the persons listed on the attached pages as near as possible to the first half of the 60's would be helpful.

3. I expect to have more names in the near future and will forward those to you as soon as they are available.

4. It would be appreciated if you could give this some priority attention.

S. D. Breckinridge

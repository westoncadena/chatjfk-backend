2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

06 January 1998

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

TO: Barry Harrelson
OIM/HRG

FROM: (Jerry Owens)(C)
OIG/IMO

SUBJECT: (AIUO) Inadvertent Destruction of Records

REF: (U) Telecon dated 06 January 1998

1. (U) Per your request, attached is a memorandum written to the Office of the Inspector Generals (OIG), Deputy and Associate Deputy IG for Investigations. The attached memorandum was also reviewed by OIG/Counsel. It explains in some detail the events we discussed in referenced telephone conversation.

2. (AIUO) It is understood by me, the undersigned, that no further action from the Inspector Generals office is required, and that this matter may be considered closed. The Office of Information Management/Historical Review Group (OIM/HRG) will notify the Assassination Review Board (ARB) and file a copy of this memorandum in HRG files to refer to when writing the compliance letter to the ARB.

3. (AIUO) It is also understood that original documents are not required when material is requested for or being added to the sequestered collection, and that copies of the material which were inadvertently destroyed were previously provided to the HSAC and ARB (or special task force) before their destruction in 1995.

4. (AIUO) With the assistance of HRG, the OIG/IMO has been able to reconstruct the file and will maintain it as a permanent record, also adding a copy of the attached to that file.

26 November 1997

TO:
Rick Cinquegrana, D/IG/INV
Judy Sholes, AD/IG/INV

FROM:
Jerry Owens (C), OIG/IMO

SUBJECT: (AIUO) Possible Illegal Destruction of Records

1.  (AIUO) The OIG/IMO received a request from the AD/IG/INV to search for records needed to verify certain nominees. During the course of this search, the IMO discovered what appeared to be the inadvertent destruction of permanent OIG records.

2.  (AIUO) The records, cases from 1977, were retired in 1980. See exhibit A for a copy of the original records retirement request.

3.  (C) When form 140 (exhibit A) was approved by the Agency Archives and Records Center (AARC) and returned with a job number (80-01770R), the records were prepared in folders, placed in boxes, and a shelflist was created (see exhibit B for shelflist).

4.  (AIUO) Please take notice of the highlighted portion of the shelflist that claims the records disposition as 'permanent'. This along with the use of the terminology 'case no.', led me to believe these were permanent records.

5.  (AIUO) Exhibit C is a completed request (form 141b) from AARC for authority to destroy these records. All of the records except those listed on a handwritten note (exhibit D) attached to form 141b were destroyed.

6.  (AIUO) At this point, I referred to the original form 140 (exhibit A) to determine what Records Control Schedule (RCS) and Item Number was used to retire these records in 1980. I ordered a copy of the old RCS 07-76 and checked the disposition of item number '3b' (see highlighted section of exhibit E). The disposition does allow for the lawful destruction of these temporary records.

SUBJECT: (AIUO) Possible Illegal Destruction of Records

7. (AIUO) I then noticed that the destruction authorization form 141b (exhibit C) listed the RCS as 10-84 and the Item Number as 29B. Referring to the newer version of the RCS I found that this schedule and item number also allow for the lawful destruction of these temporary records. Please see the highlighted text of exhibit F.

8. (AIUO) At this juncture, I reviewed the material and noticed a note on exhibit D that stated, “IG 37/77 Lonnquist (Kennedy Assassination) destroyed on 5/1/95 by S.K.".

9. (AIUO) Please see the attached JFK Assassination Act (exhibit G), para (a) (1) thru (6). In short, this law was enacted in 1992 and these records were destroyed in 1995. The fact the records were scheduled as temporary and then destroyed according to Agency regulations does not override Public Law 102-526, the JFK Assassination Act.

10. (AIUO) I found three entries in Textware on Lonnquist. Two pertain to nothing of interest in this case; however the third entry states, "allegations regarding the Lee Harvey Oswald file" (see the highlighted text of exhibit H).

11. (AIUO) In May 1997, I told the JFK Assassination Review Board (ARB) in an informal hearing, that OIG had no knowledge or record of any JFK records under OIG's perview being destroyed. This was during discussions at the table, and not one of the listed questions for the OIG/IMO to answer.

12. (AIUO) My plan is to contact the DCI/IMO, enlist his assistance in notifying the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the ARB that records pertaining to the JFK Assassination were inadvertently destroyed and explain in detail the events surrounding the discovery and what steps have been taken to prevent this from happening again.

13. (AIUO) I personally doubt that there was anything of value to the ARB in the Lonnquist case file, but because LHO is referenced it is considered a JFK ARB file, and by law I have to report its destruction to NARA and the ARB.

# JFK ASSASSINATION ACT

PUBLIC LAW 102-526-OCT. 26, 1992

Public Law 102-526
102d Congress

## An Act

106 STAT. 3443 106 STAT. 3444 44 USC 2107 note.

To provide for the expeditious disclosure of records relevant to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION L. SHORT TIILE

Oct. 26, 1992 [S. 3006)

President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

This Act may be cited as the "President John F. Kennedy Collection Act of 1992."
Collection Act of 1992. 44 USC 2107. note. 44 USC 2107 note.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS, DECLARATIONS, AND PURPOSES.

(a) FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.-The Congress finds and declares that-

(1) all Government records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should be preserved for historical and governmental purposes;

(2) all Government records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure, and all records should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination;

(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable, independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of such records,

(4) legislation is necessary because congressional records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy would not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the year 2029;

(5) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of Informa- tion Act, as implemented by the executive branch, has pre- vented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy,

(6) legislation is necessary because Executive Order No. 12356, entitled "National Security Information" has eliminated the declassification and downgrading schedules relating to classified information across government and has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassina- tion of President John F. Kennedy, and

(7) most of the records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of such records.

(b) PURPOSES.-The purposes of this Act are-

(1) to provide for the creation of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives and Records Administration; and

(2) to require the expeditious public transmission to the Archivist and public disclosure of such records.

SUBJECT: AESTORAGE No. 1060
AELADLE

DOI : 1961 - 1963 or 1964

NOTE: AESTORAGE represents a collation of information provided by several reliable and sensitive sources, some of them documentary. AESTORAGE information is not to be released outside of the Clandestine Services Components of CIA unless written authorization has been granted by C/SR/CI. AESTORAGE information may be transmitted to CIA field stations only after it has been coordinated with C/SR/CI.

1. Source transited Helsinki in May 1961, at which time he obtained a visa at the Soviet Embassy from one KLIMOV. Beginning shortly after Christmas 1961 and continuing on and off for the next three months, Source was interrogated by the KGB in Moscow about his contacts with the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki. Source prepared a written report giving in detail the physical description of all KGB officers who had met him in Helsinki.

2. In 1963 or 1964 Source was told by the KGB that it was unlikely he would ever be assigned to the United States as a Soviet who had defected in Helsinki could personally identify Source.

SECTION 1 CONTACT AND DEVELOPMENT

1. INDICATE HOW. WHEN. WHERE. WHY. AND BY WHOM SUBJECT WAS FIRST CONTACTED OR DEVELOPED.

In response to Headquarters requests, London Station officer George H. Katzenbach contacted Subject in London in mid-January 1965 for the purpose of debriefing him on his experiences in the pro-ChiCom milieu in Africa and western Europe up to the time of his departure from the staff of Revolution in spring 1964. This was followed up by in-depth debriefing sessions carried out by Katzenbach in a PBSWING conference room on 17,18,19 and 23 February. On the basis of these talks it was decided to recruit Subject for a test assignment in Algiers during the summer of 1965 during which time he would attempt to build long-term access and cover for reporting on activities and personalities in the Afro-Asian community. KUDESK/ICG staffer Joseph S. Tiffany was dispatched to London TDY 1-7 June for this purpose. After recruitment and agreement to LCFLUTTER examination, Subject was introduced to his Paris-based Case Officer, Rufus F. RODIGAST, on 3 June.

2. INDICATE WHETHER SUBJECT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY AND IN A SECURE MANNER TO ANY RESPONSIBLE CASE OFFICER FOR HANDLING. IF SO. INDICATE TO WHOM.

Yes/ To any Case Officer introduced to him by RODIGAST, TIFFANY or KATZENBACH.

3. LIST OTHER CASE OFFICERS WHO HAVE HANDLED SUBJECT OR WHOM HE KNOWS OR HAS KNOWN. GIVE NAMES BY WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN.

KATZENBACH - known to Subject as "Earl Wilson"

TIFFANY - "Robert 'Bob' Gustke"

RODIGAST - "Paul Weller"

## MOTIVATION AND CONTROL

SECTION 11

1. ESTIMATE SUBJECT'S MOTIVATION. (Be detailed, if possible cite evidence. Do not use stock comment such as "an communist.")

Subject's lack of funds and a job are of primary importance. His need for cash (evidenced to some extent by his attempt to peddle articles to China Quarterly, Encounter and Atlantic Monthly in the fall of '64) was critical. But of even greater significance is his desire to effect his long-range rehabilitation in order not to be stuck in the morass of the impecunious and "morally fraudulant" extreme left

2. INDICATE WHAT CONTROL. IF ANY. EXISTS OVER THE SUBJECT. (If no control, or if there is a lack of real control explain.)

For the rest of his life. Also important in Subject's motivation is the sense of adventure connected with "The Game", which is enhanced by his desire to deceive (to put one over on) those persons, such as Verges, who exploited and deceived him. Subj. evinces deep contempt for these professional revolutionaries and what he refers to, vith feeling, as their "moral fraud".

SECTION 111

Control exists quite strongly in the area of Subject's material welfare and need for rehabilitation.

## COVER

1. COVER USED BY SUBJECT AND CASE OFFICER IN THEIR MEETINGS. Subj. explained to his wife that "Wilson" (Katzenbach), who telephoned his home was an American publisher's representative.

2. COVER USED BY SUBJECT IN OBTAINING HIS INFORMATION AND IN CONTACTING HIS INFORMANTS.

Freelance journalist, author. sympathetic leftist

3. INDICATE SERVICE FOR WHICH SUBJECT THINKS HE (Will work) (Is working).

KUBARK

SECTION I۷

## INTELLIGENCE CONNECTIONS AND TRAINING

1. EXPLAIN SUBJECT'S KNOWN PAST OR PRESENT CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. INDICATE THE EXTENT SUCH CORRECTION IS KNOWN OVERTLY.

Subj. applied for association with KUBARK in 1950 and again in 1960; his enemies have tried to discredit him by calling him a KUBARK agent, but there is good evidence that this rumor campaign has not hurt him among his friends, even his friends on the extreme left of the political spectrum. No known I. S. connection.

2. LIST OTHER INDIVIDUALS (Agents, relatives, friends) WHO KNOW OF SUBJECT'S PRESENT INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.

None.

3. EXPLAIN ANY TRAINING SUBJECT HAS HAD IN CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS.

    Subject will operate under free lance journalist cover to develop contacts in the target milieu of Afro-Asian "Anti-imperialist" activity and solicit information from them on their activity, plans and views. It is possible that such contacts may lead to a possibility of employment or association with some organization in this field, but whether or not he will be instructed to accept will depend on the specific nature of the job and similar factors which cannot be anticipated now.

5.  DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED PP-PM TYPE USE OR DUTIES.

    No PM duties or use is anticipated. No systematic CA exploitation is anticipated given the risk of compromise. Selective CA exploitation within his cover situation i.e. as a provacateur or means to surface anti-Soviet material from a "National Liberation" standpoint - will be continually possible.

As signal is provided for (removal of glasses, which both wear) should either wish to prevent the meeting. A simple carbon-pad type, low level SW was used by Subject for sending emergency messages to a Paris drop. This has been replaced by an open code system to cover specific requirements, laid xx on at each meeting.

JAGUAR Report of STEBONY Surveillance

ACTION REQUIRED

REFERENCES

1. Pursuant to the suggestion contained in DIR 04341, 23 April 1965,
   we asked JAGUAR to lay on such coverage as they could manage. After some
   weeks has passed, and JAGUAR had not moved in this direction, we repeated
   our request, pointing out that STEBONY/1 would soon be leaving. Short-
   handed and hampered by certain restrictions, JAGUAR moved in to do what
   they could, and their coverage was due to start almost at the same time
   as TIFFANY was to begin his meetings with S/1. We contacted JAGUAR and
   told them to lay off (much to our chagrin) for the time being. This they
   did, but then, without our being advised, they resumed their coverage.
   We don't know exactly how long they actually had him in their sights,
   but they have now given us a letter (text below) suggesting that he was
   watched on 5, 6 and 7 June. A JAGUAR officer advised us informally
   that S/1 "seemed to be out of town" for one or two days. (TIFFANY had
   mentioned that he might take S/1 to the country for a day, but we don't
   know whether in fact he did so.)

2. Here is JAGUAR's notes

"As explained in conversation on the 8th June, 1965, we
have received a report on S/1's movements during the period 5th -
7th June, 1965. Nothing of interest was learnt about his movements
on the 6th and 7th June, but you may be interested in the following
information relating to the 5th June: -

"S/1 left his home at 11.25 and travelled by taxi to
the Haymarket where he entered the American Express offices.
He obtained a ticket for an air passage to Brussels and
a train journey to Basle, thence to Lausanne and Paris where
he was due to arrive on the 10th Jurne. He paid £20-29-1d
for his ticket. He left the American Express at 12.30 and
subsequently returned home at 13.20 hours.

"He left home again at 14.05 and went to the Clarendon
Court Hotel in Kaida Vale. He came out of the building
after five minutes and wandered around for twenty minutes
before returning to the hotel. He stayed there until 18.45
when he left alone and returned home."

3. The JAGUAR officer also told me that S/1's contact at the Clarendon
   Court Hotel was not identified by the surveillant, who in fact did not
   know which room S/1 had visited. The contact, of course, was TIFFANY,
   registered as GUSTKE.

## SUMMARY

On 18 June 1965 STEBONY/1 met KUBARK Career Agent Rufus F. RODIGAST in Paris in accordance with instructions and for the next three days underwent debriefings, briefings, an LCFLETTER examination, and training in preparation for his summer 1965 assignment to Algiers. At the conclusion of this period LCPIPIT felt that S/1: had absorbed sufficiently the guidance given him, had responded satisfactorily to Case Officer control, was apparently clear of hostile direction, and was motivated to perform creditably throughout his three-month trial employment.

SECHET/KAPOK OPLA 2555

Personally, 8/1 appeared to understand and to follow good security practices by and large, but be was concerned that his wife now suspected hin of being "ap to something" of which she did not approve. In short, his overall long-term security appeared veniet closest to Loze. avertheless, be appeared highly confident that previous denunciations to which he had been subjected would not "stick" and that he could rapidly reestablish himself among revolutionary circles.

Ris relationship to KBANK over the longer period has apparently baan of considerable interest to hin, to the extent that he stated he would be interested in some sort of career status with KUBARK (with retirement benefits) and perhaps one day a "less covert" position. At this time in our relationship with 5/1, however, LCPIPIT is concerned primarily with what to do with hin on 1 September 1965. In fact, in view of the 19-20 June developments in Algiers and the possible postponement of most of the activities 8/1 was to cover in efforts to resstablish himself as a legitimate propagandist for national liber ation movements, KUSARK may find it not only feasible, but necessary, to revise s/l's initial KUBARK mission.

In the days and weeks to come we will be reporting S/1's progress as he relates his accomplishments and problems through s/d commanications and in moetings with BODIJAST. iste shall be subaitting recommendations on 3/1's longer torm utility to KRASK as we have more information upon which to make some Judgments. We know that addressses will be subjecting the STEBORY operation to constant evaluation and analysis throughout the summer, and we will appreciate continued and coordinated guidance on how best to exploit the unique potential represented by this asset.

1. LCPIPIT SUPPORT FOR THE STEBOWY OPERATION

1. On 3 June 1965 STRONY/1 signed a letter of agreement with GDYONE in London, in effect a contract with KUBARK. Upon signing the letter of agreement and agreeing to undergo en LCVUTIER examination, 5/1 was introduced to Rufus P. RODIGAST, a KUFOLF Career Agent based in Paris who had been designated 8/1's outside case officer. RODIJAST is known to 3/1 under the alias "Poul Meller." RODICAST met at length with 3/1 on 3, 5, and 6 June and made arrange- seats for 2/1 to meet him in Paris 12 June and undergo further training, briefing, and security processing prior to esbarking on a trial assignment of some 10 weeks.

2. On 12 June 1965 8/1 made contact with RODIGAST in Paris in accordance with fastructions and was taken izmediately to a safehouse for debriefing on his 8-11 June trip in last Europe and for training in the use of S/M system 64. BODIOBST's Contact Report on this meting and his report of the debriefing are included in Attachment 3 (USC.). 5/1 was passed $200.00 18.mit.travel arrangements for his trip to Forth Africa. (See also PAL? 4057).

3. On 13 June 3/1 agaia met RODIGAST in accordance with instructions and was taken to his LCVUFTIER exssination at an LCPIPIT safehouse. The results of this examination vere forwarded in PALP 4056. In short, the outcome of the emmination was considered satisfactory for the proecsed operetional me of s/1.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

# SECRET/KAPOK OPLA 2555

4. On 14 and 15 June RODIJAST again met with S/1 for further debriefings on the latter's contacts in Paris. RODIQAST then briefed him on: KUTUER requirements for BIKE and passed on the requirements at zion forwarded in DIR 18107 and DIR 18675. RODIGAST's reports on these esetinga are also included in Attachment 8 (USC). On 14 June S/1 was passed $500.00 as an advance on his per dies and travel expenses for his next meeting with RODIGAST. RODIGAST considers 5/1 an apt student who learned the S/W system well in some two hours of instruction. Paris KURIOT Officer DONARY noted soma carelessness on S/1's part in the test messages, and this was subsequently brought to $/l's attention in the overall security briefing he received from RODIGAST.

5. The communications syuten established with $/1 consists of pre-arranged meeting sites and times, a one-way S/W system, and the use of the classified advertising section of the Algiers El Moud Jahid (received daily in Paris) by 5/1 to signal a postponement of meeting dates. The one-way syston vas chosen for this initial stage of the agent's operational relationship with KUPARK for reasons of security, given the operational climate in Algiers and the specific circles in which 3/1 must cove, and adding to the sudéen political upheaval in Algeria, 3/1 would not be in a position to receive incoming commun-ications safely. As of 23 June 3/1 had initiated S/W correspondence, his initial effort being clearly legible and the content operationally worthwhile. (800 Attachment P).

6. The next RODIOAST contact with 8/1 is scheduled for 15 July in Romo. (Sea OFLA 2538 for LCPIPIT's request for Rome Station support.) In view of the events that have just taken place in Algeria the seeting may well be concerned as much with rethinking 3/1's operational objectives for the period following 16 July as with debriefings, briefings, and passage of funda. Even though latest indications are that Barding II will prcosed as scheduled, it is questionable whether the AAJA or the Afro-Asian Komen's conference will be held in Algiers this sESIST. Moreover, there is no assurance at this writing that MEMINCE will not be either postponed, canceled, or moved elsewhere. Add to this the possibility that LDEN A might be on the scene profiting from the sudden rise in the political fortunes of his friends, and Algiers suddenly Losss some of its appeal as an area in which to carry out a msaningful test of 5/1's operational capabilities. The next three weeks will tell us much and perhaps allay many of our apprehensions.

7. Bevertheless, RODICAST must be prepared to handle a number of eventualities in his 15 July meeting, not the least of these being a possible revision of s/1's mission. The following possible alternatives present them-selves; we ask Readquarters to address its attention to thes and to other developmental targats and to cable recommendations and guidance prior to 13 Julys

   A. 8/1 to remain on site, contime his efforts to establish credentials and find a job in Algiers, or elesbere, in the national liberation sovenant, and report on political developments in Algeria.

   B. 4/1 to travel to Dar es Salaam to look into the job offer made some tins ago by Dennis PROGEAR.

   C. 8/1 to proceed to Brussels to continue development of IDEN B (ase OFTA 2541).

   D. 8/1 to return to London to write up reports and operational proposals and polish up the translation of IDEM B's book.

   E. 3/1 to follow the KEPOKE caravan wherever it may lead (perhaps Bofia?) and continue to lock for job leads (outside the flos).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

8. The second BODIJAST meeting of the summer with 5/1 is tentatively scheduled for the second week in August, site to be determined. Addressees will know that 8/1's wife is expecting their third child o/a 11 August and that 8/1 intends to be in London at that tism if at all possible. Although he told RODIGAST he would forego a visit to London at that time if it were operationally aszacery, he would find it difficult to justify his absence to his wife unless he were to have a truly Blausible and urgent cover assignment. We must therefore anticipate in all likelihood that 5/1 will be out of action for most of the second week of August. In any event, RODIGAST will probably be able to meet 8/1 somewhere in Europe when 3/1 returns to be with his wife and will at that time hope to be in a position to discuss with 8/1 the best employment of his talents for the balance of the three-month contract period and to pursue with his his longer range utilization as well. Headquarters views, then, are needed both with respect to the wenke immediately following the 15 July meeting referred to in the previous paragraph as well as with respect to the post- August period.

9. Adsinistratively, LCPIPIT has so far funded 5/1 to the extent of $700.00 and has initiated action to have his salary and nonsccountable operational advance deposited to his Swiss bank account. Thess paysants are being made in advance because of 5/1's initially pressing financial needs. It is our understanding that the 1 July and 1 August 1965 deposits of $600.00 to 8/1's Swiss bank account will be effected securely and on time through BIMAD/1 (ace DIR 20944 and DIR 21703). Action was also taken to clarify the question of 5/1's per diem. We have received his initial accountings for travel, per dien, and operational expenses for the period 8-12 June.

10. Of the basis of information available to LCPIPIT, 8/1 has received the following payments from KUBAEK since he was first contacted in London by George H. KATZENBACH in January of this year (we have no record at hand of the KUBAEK funds passed 3/1 by PATHNAN of KRZESIS):

## II. PHELDIRARY ASSRSSARINT

12. At this stage in KUBANK's relationship with STRBORY/1 it is well to note certain factors that must be taken into consideration as we seek to devise a longer-ters operation centered on his capabilities and potential. For the sake of brevity, if not precision, we will discuss these factors under the following headings: Tactical Assets, Intitretion, Bandling & Moidance, Security, Termination, and KUBARK Operational Requiresents.

### PERSONAL ASSETS:

13. STEBOWY/1, as has been noted in CELA 42,750 "really astonishes with the breadth of his personal information and understanding... 1 of 7 African affairs (especially in left-wing fields), European Trotskyists and Communists and their general milieu, and Chinese-oriented international front organizations. twilarly, he appears to be informed on certain Chicon efforts at subversion and propaganda in Latin Asarica." Combined with this knowledge and understanding is a long list of personal contacts in left-wing revolutionary circles and a reputation as an articulate and committed agitator for national liberation movements.

14. The Agent emies an air of self-confidence and presents himself wall and dynamically in interpersonal relationships. He has demonstrated talent as a working Journalist, especially as a reporter. While we have limited infor-sation here upon which to base an evaluation of the accuracy and thoroughness of his reports, they have tended to be consistent on the whole and reveal the workings of a wind capable of storing away vast amounts of information and recalling it with minimal stimulation, s/1 seems to have good command of the French language and can get by in Italian and Spanish. Re has had considerable experience in international travel, apparently accommodating wall to various degrees of disccafort and hardship as the case may require. He is able to use caceras and tape recorders operationally, and he quickly learned a/v techniques.

15. Because of his coloring and facial characteristics s/1 oan pass relatively unnoticed as a Forth African, Near Easterner, South Asian, or American Regro, inter alia. Re gives the impression of being able to strike up casual friendships readily and easily.

### ROTAVATION

16. This is a sticky arsa open to considerable speculation st this point, though there are specific actions and statements on the part of s/1 indicating he has sought some professional relationship with KUBARK for averal years. be understand, for example, that he tried to establish contact with OUYOKE while a sturient in Italy in 1951-52, that he appeared to be wort cooperative when questioned by P33-ING Paris in relation to the assassination of President Zennedy, and that he took a calculated (?) risk by writing in directly to KUBANK in the summer of 1962 offering his services. In his contacts with KUBBARKers since January of this year he has given every indication of being forthcoming and, apparently, sincerely interested in cooperating with us. One has the impression he was hoping to be recruited, and be certainly didn't play hard to got.

17. How that he has signed a letter of agreement, undergon an LCFLUTTER, and been passed a considerable amount of KUBARK monty he may consider himself already "on the tean," though in effect he was told specifically at the outast that he had to prove himself over the next three months. Ha has intinsted to RODICAST that he would like to parlay his present association with KUBANK into a long-term career relationship including retirement, insurance, etc. He has even alluded to an interest in working for RODIGAST's "service" in a "less covert" capacity sometime in the future.

18. One basic cuestion rests with all of us concernods Why?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

# SECRET/KAPOK OPLA 2555

In his early talks with the London Station and again in his talks with BODIGAST and TIFFANY the Agent has indicated come degree of disenchantment with the organizations and personalities, if not the ideology, of the left-wing factions with which he had been so intimately involved. He has never goon so far as to renounce his birthright and citizenship, nor does he consider himself disloyal after several years of professional anti-PEPADE activity. He intimates that he would someday like to return home, though he doubts he would be allowed to live down his past and start a new career in PEPIDE.

19. On the basis of information available to us we could not say that 5/1 is or ever was an ideologically committed Marxist-Leninist. We might say that he has nurtured over the years a smouldering prejudice against the "in" group, both domestically and internationally. He has been an "out" most all of his life, and he has shown a strong attachment to the causes of the downtrodden Cubans, the colonially oppressed Africans, the organizationally subdued "young Turks" of orthodox communist and other leftist movements, etc. There is no question that in his sympathy for such causes he overstepped the bounds of reason and good sense, but it is doubtful that he actually committed any treasonable offense. One has the feeling that 5/1 really sought to hedge his bets on the revolutionaries by putting out feelers to KUBARK.

20. There is a strong case for the argument that hard cash plays a significant role in motivating 5/1 to cooperate with KUBARK at this point in time. All reports emphasize that he was not just broke, but deeply in debt, when he began talking to London Station. Subsequently he has been receiving what amounts to a salary at a rate somewhat in excess of average for a European journalist, let alone a professional call-time revolutionary. Since he has had no valid cover story for anything other than the first advance(s) from KOPERA, we cannot be sure that he has let his wife, his in-laws, or his immediate circle of associates know the extent of his newly-acquired affluence. He is quite capable of thinking big operationally and has bluntly stated that it takes money to "move" in Algiers and that "poverty is no virtue in the 'Third world'".

21. But 5/1 does not appear to be an out and out mercenary. There must be other factors than money alone that would lead him to cooperate with KUBARK. It could well be that he is reacting philosophically to an outlook on life that let him down despite years of devoted cultivation. In the long debriefings he rarely, if ever, mentioned anyone who he felt had really accomplished anything as a professional left-wing revolutionary. There are indications that he regards his activities over recent years as somewhat unrewarding, though there is little indication that he didn't enjoy much of what he did or that he doesn't consider the cause of the national liberation movements a just and honorable cause. He may, simply, have reappraised the results of some years of revolutionary activity with a somewhat jaundiced eye and decided it was time for a change.

22. Certainly 5/1 builds a convincing case about the reasons for his break with DEH C, but it must also be noted that ideology is not among them. If anything, it would seem he was reacting to a breach of contract and perhaps wounded pride. The net result seemed to be a well of resentment against one individual, which resentment fermented into spite and determination to "get even." If this assumption is granted, then the letter he had published in ZHEARTH and the manuscript he submitted to KMENESIS are both explainable and explain such. It was his involvement with these publications that triggered KUBARK's operational interest in him, and we initiated contact at a period when he was, perhaps, basking in (what he probably considered) the success of his attack on LIKH A.

23. Looked at from still another angle, 5/1's future prospects in January of this year (both in his professional and his personal life) were anything but bright for: he was jobless, in debt, to some extent cast off by the revolutionary movement, apparently felt homeless (as far as having something to which he could return in PEPIDE), and (from what scraps of information we can piece together) was not experiencing a mutually agreeable marital life. (He asserts he was unfaithful and that his wife knew it. We have learned from KATZERACH's talks with the ORTHEAS that she was unfaithful in her turn.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

though we have no confirmation of this from 8/1). In such a situation KUBARK was able to offer 3/1 an opportunity to, in effect, begin anew, get out of a hole, rebuild his own self-esteem, and perhaps even build up some credit toward an eventual return to PBPRIDE under conditions which he would find bearable.

24. It is interesting that in his long conversations with RODIGAST he should raise the question of his motivation as if to reassure ODYOKE that he was "on the level." He protested that we must not think that he had taken on this job just to "get out of a hole" for three months and explained that he wasn't really in a hole. He claimed that his debts to his brother-in-law were not a pressing matter at all. (However, during his LCFUNTER examination we are told that the area in which he reacted most strongly was that concerning personal obligations, especially financial. We were probing to find out if he was indeed under some obligation, financial or otherwise, to certain of his revolutionary associates of the past two and a half years, and what ensued was an outpouring of all the small and not so small debts he owed virtually everyone he know. Foremost among these was the debt of some $ 1,500 to his brother-in-law. Whether or not he feels pressed to repay is not as important as the fact that there seem to be times when it weighs heavily on his mind.)

25. Giving S/1 the last word, the following report from RODIGAST on his 14 June conversation with the Agent should be given careful consideration: "It was clear that he was telling me, without spelling it out in words, that he had made up his mind to cooperate with us because, or partly because, he had decided he wanted to be on our side. He even used expressions like 'our side'. I had the feeling that he did not want to say outright that he was changing his political orientation for fear that we would not believe him, but that in fact he might very well be doing so; I think there was something genuine in his protestation that he wasn't with us 'only for the money'."

HANDLING & GUIDANCE:

26. The least that can be said of 3/1 in summarizing his relationship with his KUBARK contacts so far is that he is not docile and passive. He appears to be a self-starter with a sense of what is necessary to get an operation off the ground. From his account of his work for IDEN C it would appear that he can honestly claim a great deal of credit for putting the English edition into business.

27. To date 5/1 has expressed no reluctance to undertake his current mission nor to consider other missions for KUBARK which might work a hardship on him or place his person or reputation in jeopardy. His responsiveness, in fact, encourages us to believe that he will accept assignments which permit him to move easily in those revolutionary left circles which are natural to him and which comprise, in effect, his natural target. He has, of course, made a case for working out of Paris, Rome, or Geneva rather than Algiers or Djakarta, but this was prior to his entering into a formal relationship with ODYOUR.

28. RODIGAST feels that he has been able to establish a good degree of working rapport with 8/1 and perhaps even some degree of personal rapport. They have had some half-dozen meetings so far, including three working sessions in Paris. RODICAST has stressed to him the vital importance of good security habits, not the least of which involves such personal behavior as will keep him out of compromising situations (in respect to his work for KUBARK).

29. 8/1 has been on time for all his meetings with RODICAST and has complied well with instructions; he submitted without hesitation to the LCFUNTER and agreed to work with 3/V (accepting the risks involved in disposal of the working materials). 5/1 has not failed to remind RODIGAST of the probable cost of his upkeep and operational activities while in Algiers and has been assured that RODICAST "fought for the $20.00 per diem


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

# SECRET/KAPOK

## OFTA 2555

right on up the line." Needless to say, STEBONY/1 seemed most happy to know that RODICAST was concerned for his welfare.

30. RODIGAST feels that he can manage S/1's self-assertion and dynamism, and LCPIPIT points to RODIGAST's record of handling "difficult" agents. RODICAST's experience is reassuring in this connection, and we have no reservations about RODICAST's ability to keep STEBONY/1 motivated in the months ahead.

31. A last word on the matter of handlings turn-over, So far S/1 has dealt with KATZENBACH, TIFFANY, and RODICAST and has been forthcoming with all. There is no indication at this early stage that he has placed his relationship with KUBARK on a person-to-person plans nor are we sure he should be encouraged to do so. As representatives of ODYOKE the three persons mentioned above have apparently earned S/1's trust, and anyone introduced to him by one of there would probably be accepted with the same degree of confidence should the introduction of another case officer become necessary. In effect, then, we foresee no handling problem with S/1 as far as a change in case officers might be concerned. We would point out, though, that S/1 has been handled sympathetically and without hostility to date and that those who have dealt with him would strongly advise firm intelligent direction and against a provocative or heavy-handed approach to such a complex and self-centered personality.

### SECURITY:

32. S/1's very background is enough to pose all the security problems one would want to contend with in any operation. At the same time it is that very background that makes him valuable to KUBARK. Therefore we can discount many logical apprehensions about his personal loyalty and motivation (discussed previously) and proceed to questions of operational security.

33. First of all, S/1 has been denounced as a KUBARK agent since the mid-1950's when, to the best of our knowledge, he wasn't actively involved in revolutionary activities. He traces this original denunciation to an incident in which he resorted to some rather unscrupulous practices (forgery and false denunciation) to get an erstwhile friend and CFUSA member (with whose wife he had become involved) discredited in France. (See Attachment to ORLA 43,272). The upshot was that S/1 was considered by many who knew him in Paris to be a KUBARK agent who had informed on his communist "friend" to the French police. From that time to the present the KUBARK tag has stuck in certain circles, though STEBONY/1 feels those who really know him, and those important revolutionaries and communists whom he knows and who are his potential targets as a KUBARK agent, have largely discounted the possibility that this could be so. There is no denying the fact, however, that this denunciation is a handicap. It has been used fairly effectively by his last employer, IDEN A, to burn him in a number of places where he was probably previously unknown. Certainly the publication of the denunciation in IDEN C did not raise his stature in some quarters. LOND 7620 indicates S/1's enemies have little desire to let sleeping dogs lie.

34. Furthermore, IDEN A seems at this moment to hold as great a grudge against S/1 as S/1 holds against him, and IDEN A may still have better connections in the national liberation movement than S/1. This is especially so in view of the 19-20 June 1965 downfall of the Ben Bella regime in Algeria. IDEN A was not a Ben Bella man, and his fortunes declined sharply in inverse proportion to the rise of Ben Bella's. IDEN A's closest link to Algeria's power elite has long been Rabah Bitat, according to S/1. In the papers of 22 June we read that, in a "startling development," former Vice-President Mohammed Ritat flew into Algiers from exile in France and said he was ready to "assume his responsibilities." We presume that IDEN A will seek to move quickly to derive personal advantage from this sudden change in Algeria. As if operating in the Algerian security climate were not hazardous enough, S/1 may well have to contend with a vendetta mounted by IDEN A.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 16

## OFLA 2555

35. S/1's family situation presents some cause for concern. As noted in the discussion on motivation, he has been receiving funds since January with only SKOPPRA to give as a source. His wife, who is a conscientious leftist, is presently suspicious of his activities, he says, largely because he received a phone call from PBSWING London in January. He explained it was a PBPRIDE journalist passing through who wished to talk with him, to which she was supposed to have retorted: "Why should someone from PBPRIDE be interested in you, and, moreover, why should you be interested in working for anything or anyone from PBPRIDE?" S/1 told RODIGAST that the backstopping effort initiated by LOND 8004 did not fully dispel her skepticism. S/1's reaction to the FLIFTER examination on the question of what his wife thinks" suggests that the matter is not laid to rest.

36. S/1 seems to be most concerned that his wife not find out he is working for ODYOKE, let alone KUBARK, and we presume he has reason to feel she would probably say or do something, whether deliberate or not, that would compromise him in his present situation. We do not know the history of S/1's marriage, but we have received indications from him that lead us to believe he could not count on her discretion and loyalty in all circumstances. His relationship with his wife, therefore, must be watched with some care to insure that it does not comprise an undue hazard or that she does not become vulnerable in some way to forces inimical to his effectiveness in his work for KUBARK.

37. Aside from speculation about possible repercussions in this area of their marital relationship, there remains the question of cover for some $3,100 passed S/1 by KUBARK in the past six months. His wife has been in the Journalism business long enough to know that virtually unemployed journalists are not usually given travel and salary advances merely for the asking, especially when their press credentials are largely notional or the nominal sponsor has yet to go into publication. Thus, we have reason to believe she has some rather nagging doubts as to the legitimacy of S/1's present cover job. This is implicit in Paragraph 5 of the attachment of OFLA 43,272.

38. On 15 June S/1 told RODIGAST his wife told him on the phone that a letter to his from IDEN D warned him to be careful as things might be 'hot' for him in Algeria." IDEN D had apparently heard of S/1's forthcoming trip from contacts in New York and Paris, and S/1 surmises this means news of his summer's travels must be rather common knowledge by now.

39. At TIFFANY's request S/1 let IDEN E know he was in Paris, and S/1 says that latter "came rushing around" to see his. S/1's report on this contact was passed to the Paris Station 17 June by LCPIPITH. In the report is S/1's assessment that IDEN E would probably be willing to talk to RODIGAST's "service." We shall discuss this case further with Paris Station, but in the meantime it should be noted for the record that as long as S/1 is said by many to be a KUBARK agent, it would not be unreasonable to assume that IDEN E might connect an approach by an ODYOKE representative with his recent conversations with S/1. Therefore, the possibility of a flop here should not be ignored.

40. As far as S/1's contacts with KUBARK, he knows no one by true name and his case officer will continue to use an alias in all future contacts. At the same time, there is the ever-present danger that he may some day come to know RODIGAST's true name because of the number of acquaintances they have in common in Paris. It was largely for this reason that RODIGAST will avoid holding future operational meetings with S/1 in Paris. RODIGAST has already reportedthe rather unsettling experience of having S/1 tell him: "I think I've seen you someplace before." RODIGAST says this is quite possible. Were S/1 ever to stay in Paris for a considerable length of time the chances are not remote that RODIGAST's identity would be compromised to S/1.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

# SECRET/KAPOK

OFLA 2555

## TERMINATION:

41. The question of termination is not academic at this time, for explicit in the letter of agreement which S/1 signed is his termination on 1 September 1965 unless specific conditions are met. It is doubtful that KUBARK will indeed terminate S/1 on that date unless such action is made imperative for reasons of security or of gross malfeasance on his part.

42. In the event of the termination of S/1 we foresee at this time no great cause for concern about possible repercussions against KUBARK personnel or installations. In addition to the use of aliases, RODICAST's meetings with him will be in third countries, and S/1 has not been passed classified information. He does keep in his possession materials for the use of S/W System #64. He received training in the use of these materials (and underwent his LCFLUTTER) & in the apartment of two LCPIPIT contract personnel. This apartment, an LCPIPIT safehouse, was used only once previously for a clandestine meeting, and it will not be used again for at least two months.

43. Should it prove necessary to terminate S/1 the greatest danger which we can anticipate at this time grows out of his considerable skill as a writer and the possibility that this skill might be used to attack KUBARK or ODYOKE in some way, perhaps from the forum of the national liberation movement propaganda machinery which he has now forsaken. His knowledge of our operations and personnel has been kept to a minimum. Hence the danger of his pen speaking with great force or effectiveness is, we believe, not great and a problem which, though we must anticipate it, we believe to be remote.

## KUBARK OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

44. All concerned would agree that a KUBARK agent who is unable to service KUBARK operational requirements would not be worth his keep. At the same time, it would be presumptuous to expect that in a situation where the agent is being handled at arm's length and under such disadvantages in time and distance as in S/1's case, KUBARK's operational requirements could be regularly and, if necessary, speedily measured against the agent's capabilities and specific requirements levied on the agent.

45. So far in KUBARK's relationship with S/1 we have outlined a general target area for him, levied the requirement that he prove to KUBARK he can effectively penetrate that target area and operate in place, and levied subsidiary KUBARK requirements for him to service as a by-product of his basic operational task. What we have assigned, in effect, is a short term operational mission upon which longer term operations might be based.

46. There is evidence in the reams of "testimony" KUBARK has taken from S/1 that he is a man who likes to operate, act, produce. There is also evidence that he, like any other human, consciously seeks approval and recognition of his work. The question to be posed is: Has KUBARK at this time, or will it have on 1 September 1965, an assignment for S/1 in which he can find satisfaction in producing a marketable product and find that approval and recognition which he requires? We must be more specific with him than to say: "Go out to Djakarta and see what you can dig up. We'll meet you again in two months for discussions." Rather, it would be well at this stage to review with the various area divisions those geographic areas in which S/1's talents could be fully exploited (Chile with FUSES?, Venezuela as an FALN penetration?, Djakarta as an AAJA staffer?, Ghana as a DAA writer?, Tanzania as a Government Radio editor?, etc., etc.) and to have a definite assignment for S/1 in hand at the moment we negotiate the extension of his contract.

47. Certainly the sudden change of leadership in Algeria can be expected to affect the national liberation movement and personalities in that movement who has drawn succor from the Ben Bella regime. As noted in the section on security, it is reasonable to assume that S/1 will be in a less


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

SECNET/KAPOK OPLA 2555

than fortuitous position if his efforts to reassert himself on the national liberation movement stage are to meet with brickbats from IDEN A fres a frent row seat. ALGI 6171 and PARI 1934 tend to support the estimate that S/1's friends in the Ministry of Information may now be gone, while IDEN A's Algerian friends may soon be in positions of power. While it is still too early to assume that such a situation will arise, it is not too soon to assess the possible damage this could do S/1 in the gameal target area so far assigned him and to watch closely for signs that he my truly be burned beyond operational usefulness to KUBARK. We would hope this should not eone to pass, but we cannot ignore the possibility.

48. In the event, then, that the next two month's activities compromise S/1's credentials in the national liberation movement, where shald we go from there? Ons suggestion would be a TDY to ZAPETAL where his brain might be picked for operational leads and KUMEE, KUINSK, and KUMOLP information. Re could also be urged to write out and edit a member of exposés on fraud, deception, and general double-dealing in the national revolution movement and in certain commanist circles. He might find a Job with IDEN B tho may well need a new crutch if S/1's reports of his dininishing influence are to be given credence. In short, steps ought to be taken now to define the alternatives awaiting S/1 as of 1 September 1965.

Richard says Mark can call his at home between 12.30 and 13.30 hours or after 16.00 hours.

Richard gives Pablo greetings from PETITA (or BETITA, ph) who says she is sending Richard and Pablo a new magazine called "Street" to be shared.

Yepe confiras Mark's having Galina's number, then remarks that one of the two people Mark had wanted to contact GESON - hai rung the Embassy. Kark resinas Yepe of their having boked up together the telephone cumbers of the Tanzanien Eission. Mark has two numbers, one GRO zumber and one FLA number (Note: the FLA number is FLA 2327, how number of Dennis PROBEAH, Administrative Attache. Kark had earlier said he had two people in LONDON to contact, Richard GIBSON and Dennis.) He asks Yepe which is the office number. Yepe checks then says it is GRO 8951. Vark notes the Kission's address. Farewells.

1st June, Cont.

17.10 hours: Mark SCHEFFER calls from the Embassy to Yepe's flat, speaks to Yepe's wife, Galina, says he, "Maria and the children" will spend the night with the Yepes. His wife and children are at present in Pablo's flat (Note: Both flats are in Park West).

17.30 hours: Mark SCHLEIFFER called at Embassy by Richard GIBSON, who suggests their sharing a flat in ALGIERS. Mark need to brush up their French before "the others pour in" to ALGIERS. Mark agrees to go to Pichard's fat, 30 Stockleigh Hall, Prince Albert Road, to discuss various points. Mark mentions that his wife is an "Afro-American". Richard says that integration is much worse here than in the U.S..

2nd June

11.00 hours: Yepe calls the C.7.T.Ξ., speaks to telex room, asks whether they can send a telex to Yepe's brother in Rumania. He explains that his (lepe's) brother is Cuban Ambassador to Rumania and is due to go to Cuba today or tomorrow. He wants first to establish whether his brother is still in Rumania. If he is, Roberto wants the following message passed: "If you see Lec BERYAN in Quba, please pass this message to him - 'If you come to LONDON, Dennis PEOMBEAH is anxious to see you'. (Signed) Roberto Yepe".

12.30 hours: Pablo calls Cuban Embassy (believed PARIS) (Obtained by direct calling.) Speaks to Esther, then asks for Paco, who mentions that Guillermo has to return to Cuba, because his daughter has a cerebral haemorrhage. Pablo says he and Kamuja are also "going to return". Paco asks "But they haven't called you?" Pablo replies "No". Gives no further explanation, but will write to Paco. Mentions that Mark SCHLEIFFER is going to PARIS and will telephone Paco. Guillermo, Paco remarks, has already caught his plane to PRAGUE, Kiriaz is alone. Guillermo had been in touch with FRANQUI, and ROA had agreed to his going. This leaves the Commercial attache.

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Malcolm X - Carlos Moore and
Sandy Bethune. (Afro-American Unity Group in Paris)

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment is a Xerox copy of a photostat of a transcript of a telephone conversation between Carlos Moore (and his friend candy Bethune) and the late Malcolm X, which took place 8 or 9 February 1945. UGAR obtained this transcript on 4 June from the editor of the West Indian Gazette, (fnu) Manchanda. SUGAR believes that Manchanca got the photostat from the Ghana High Commission office in London. He further believes that the Afro- American unity group in Paris (among whom there is only one member with U. ১. citizenship: the American Negro photographer, John Taylor) probably supplied the transcript to the Ghana officials as a means of buliding their credentials as a bona fide revolutionary organisation, perhaps one entitled to receive financial support.

2. SUGAR gave the current (June 1965) address of Jamaican/Ceban Carlos Moore as: c/o Pedro Filipe, 168 Rue Grenelle, Paris 7e, France. SUGAR said that Filipe is a Cuban national.

## 21 June 65

Talked to Cy Goodrich this morning about STEPONY. He feels that he is on the level with us, that he is legitimately disenchanted with the far left, that he sees himself as a loyal American, that KATZENBACH was incorrect in saying that STEBONY would find it morally repugnant to act as a political action agent but would willingly serve as an FI collection asset (which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.) STEBONY was not in the least reluctant to take the LOFLUTTER; passed it apparently clean. The cover is admittedly a bit flimsy, but is supplemented by a connection with Tunisian L'ection for which he will do some layout work and writing. Cy believes that he understands perhaps better than he did the need for cover and attribution of income. Contract provides for $500 a month plus $100 non-accountable ops expenses plus $10 a day while in Algiers, plus $20 a day while in travel status, 1 June through 31 August, renewable for a two year period if mutually desirable and satisfactory, with 30 day termination clause. We have told MEN JAGUAR of our recruitment of STEECNY - Cy does not believe that they are in direct touch with him, but that they are in contact with friends of his, particularly one MARCHANY? or some such name. I asked Cy what STEBONY had been asked to do for us in Algiers, and he replied " to work himself into a position of access to get information on factions and all developments in the conferences which have not been publicized." I asked if he had been given any requirements which dealt with strictly Algerian matters and he said No, that Rodigast had been told that we would send further requirements for the meeting tentatively scheduled with STEBCNY in Rome or Tangier around 18 June.

I talked to Bob Wiley, who will draw to a list of requirements to send RODIGAST. Cy Goodrich and I agreed that I would open-ops-files-on STEBONY, even though we have no project yet, and he will give me the contents of his soft file to include in it. He is also having the 20h file tidied up by RI and will have it charged to AF/1

STEBONY/CRPREY/Operational Contact with Iden A

201

1.  For the Information of COS, Brussels: KUDESK and KUOLF are jointly engaged in the operational exploitation of the peculiar talents and contacts of a newly-acquired asset. STERONY/1 (Iden B) STRONY/1 bae had a rather turbulent career as a leftist revolutionary agitator and propagandist over the past several years during which time he came to know (and be known by) a hamber of significant personalities in the pro-Chinese factions of several Buropean Commnist Parties. Among these personalities is iden A. STEBаул ans been denomead within these same circles as & KUBARK agent for some time, though atil January of this year FUBARK was not in contact with him It wha only early June of this year that re actually signed a letter of agree- went with an "ODYOFOR Service". Currently STEBONY/1 is in Algeria seeking to re-establish Limself in revolutionary circles as a prelude to a long- teru penetration operation (at KUBANK's behest) targeted against the revolu tionary cadres of Africa Asia and Latin America which are apparently being given increasingly direct support by Peking.

2.  One of STEBONY/1's bona fides in revolutionary circles is his acquaintance with Iden A wo kas told him that. personally, he does not share the doubts spread about STEBOMY/1 because, as Iden A puts it. HY/1's primary accuser not caly charges he is a KUBARK agent but also an iden A agent, which Iden A of course knew not to be the case Flowever, ETY3ORY/1 is actually in the precess of seeking to ingratiate himself with Idea A and of winning his confidence to suoti an extent that their personal relationship might serve as STEBOWY/1's credentials for some time to come At present the relationship shows signs of being off to a good start. STESONY/1 visited Icen A in Brussels on June 1965 with the intention of getting himself accredited as a correspondent of Iden A's newspaper, Iden C. Idem A told bin that, in fact. Iden was sending Iden to Algiers to cover the summers activities there Idea A then added that Iden D would get in toush with Story/l in Algiers (c/e Iden E) so that STEBOHY/L could "intro- duce him around". SPERCHY/1 considers this a fortuitous circumstance in that

he can exploit Iden A as a 'walking credential' in Algiers a unique way to
suggest to himself is one of Iden A's boys. It should be noted on the
other hand, that this situation provides Iden A a unique means of monitor-
ing STESONY/1's activities and contacts

3. Of priority interest at this moment, however, is the fact that Iden
   A has expressed to STESONY/1 his dissatisfaction with the progress to date
   in getting his book (Iden A, published in English). Iden A claims that an
   Australian is supposed to be working on a translation but that he has heard
   nothing from him in over six months. STESONY/1 then told Iden A that he himself
   could do the translation job with the aid of friends but that he would have
   to spend some time with Iden A to work over fine points and to write together
   a new chapter updating the book. In this way STESONY/1 feels he could cement
   his personal relationship with Iden A

4. There are obviously operational and station policy questions that
   should be considered in this context. First of all, our sole reporter on
   the STESONY/1-Iden A relationship is STESONY/1 himself. Is he really seeking
   to set up a meaningful operational gambit to be exploited by EUBANK, or is he
   seeking to regain status among his former peers? We tend to believe the former
   on the basis of the results of STESONY/1's CFOSTER examination and his long
   conversations with his deep cover case officer. Secondly, would the damage to
   the [???] national interest inherent in the publication of Iden A's book in
   English outweigh the operational gain to be made by putting STESONY/1 in Iden
   A's confidence. STESONY/1 argues that, on the contrary, the publication of
   the book in English could hurt no one except possibly Iden A himself, because
   STESONY/1 claims the book is a tiresome polemic against one small communist
   group by another small communist group. [???] has no intention of recommend-
   ing that [???] help get the book in print in any case for that would be
   Iden A's own problems forever. If STESONY/1 did not undertake too transla-
   ting job, the Australian would probably come through before too long anyway.

5. We are sure that addressees can see in this situation the seeds of
   a useful operational contact with Iden A who, according to various reports
   STESONY/1 is receiving from others of his contacts in the pro-Chinese factions
   of the European Communist Parties. is starting to lose his grip on his own
   organization.

6. In any event, unless advised to the contrary, we intend to encourage
   STESONY/1 to continue developing his relationship with Iden A, especially as
   regards translation of the book. We are forwarding to Headquarters (use)
   a copy of the book and request that the appropriate office in AP be
   approached immediately and asked to provide, on a priority basis, an English-
   language translation which we can pass to STESONY/1. He could then rework
   this translation somewhat and involve his wife in the editing of it pre-
   senting the finished product to Iden A as a family effort. Of particular
   importance from a critical point of view is that translations of quota-
   tions from non-Francophone sources (Marx and Lenin for example) should be
   consistent with the 'official' English-language version of the quotations.

7. The time element involved is this: KUWOL Career Agent Rufus P
   BOCIDAST will be meeting STESONY/1 in Rome on or about 15 July. At that
   time he should have some firm word from EUBANK on the status of the trans-
   lation effort. In matter of fact, of course, the ideal situation would be
   to have the translation in hand at that time though we cannot gauge from
   here whether that is within the realm of possibility. In any case [???]
   would have to have the translation definitely in hand the first week of
   August when he will be leaving Paris for his second meeting with STESONY/1

FROM: Chief of Station, London

SUBJECT: STEBONY JAGUAR Report on STEBONY/1

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES: Refs: LOND 8101

1. Following is the full text of the JAGUAR letter, a part of which was transmitted under ref:

"We have received the following two items of intelligence about S/1:

1. Some time in May this year, S/1 said that he would be going to Tunisia on 15th June to work on the staff of the paper "L'Action."

2. After his quarrel with Jacques VERGES in 1964, S/1 received 200 as "personal financial assistance" from Jacques GRIPPA, the leader of the pro-Chinese Communist faction in Belgium. Nils ANDERSSON also gave him financial help.

Our sources were not able to say when the financial assistance was given to S/1 but presumably that from GRIPPA was made available some time between July and November last year."

2. S/1 reported to Station in May that he had had an offer of a job on L'Action, but there was no intention of his accepting it.

3. London has some doubts about whether S/1 in fact received this much money from GRIPPA. We suspect that he has told people this to enhance his stature as a "Chinese agent"; we still wonder, though, what funds he may have been covering this way, since we had not contacted him as of the time in question. Perhaps, as a result of ref, LCPIPIT may shed some light on this point.

PRIORITY

1. KUMOLP Career Agent Rufus P. RODIGAST is now the deep cover case officer for STYBONY/1 a newly-acquired potential penetration asset targeted on the pre-Chicos revolutionary movements of Africa Asia and Latin America. On or about 15 July 1965 STYBONY/1 will proceed from his current base of operations (Algiers) to meet with RODIGAST in Rome per Idea A.

2. While in Rome STYBONY/1 plans to stay with Iden B. Moreover Idea B's apartment may be used as a meeting site for RODIGAST and STYBONY/1 when Iden B is at work. In view of this we request Station and Headquarters traces (KUDARK and ONENVY only) on Idea B.

3. While in Rome RODIGAST will more than likely require Station support in the nature of pickups and pouching facilities for documents cash travel advances for STYBONY/1 (which are to be 7/A'd to Headquarters charge YAITCH) and cable commo facilities should the need arise. RODIGAST is known to Base Station Officer Lovell FALSTON and perhaps others in the Station. RODIGAST is also known to and knows the witting personnel in POGREGALE.

4. We would appreciate hearing from Rome Station at your earliest convenience concerning your capability to render the type of support noted above. RODIGAST would plan to make contact with the Station through POGREGALE unless the Station should desire an alternate contact plan

2. We have made most of this material available to JAGUAR. The sections headed "Interest of Foreign Communist and Leftist Groups in the American Negro Problem," "The Robert Williams Case," "Black Nationalism," and "The American Negro" were not passed to JAGUAR.

3. We are retaining one copy of the entire study, which we are making available for review by CHEVY/London, who have expressed interest in this material. We trust that ODENVY Headquarters will be appropriately advised of the contents of these papers.

4. We see no reason for London Station to retain this copy in the files, and propose to destroy it unless Headquarters asks us to send it on to some other addressee. Similarly, we plan to destroy our copy of the rough transcript of the debriefing (previously forwarded under OELA 42,706, 9 March 1965) unless Headquarters would like us to send it on. In either case, let us know of your wishes regarding these items by, say, 15 July. In the absence of any instructions by that time, we will destroy them.

JaGUah crficer's Comment on the 1/1 and di

ACTION REQUIRED

DATE 10 June 1965

REFERENCES

1. In the course of an informal discussion on 8 June with the JAGUAR officer most familiar with the history of STEBONY/1 (and our relationship with hin), the JAGUAR officer commented that he was frankly surprised at the volume of sexual activity of the African Communists and far-leftists. His first reference was to types such as Jeanne PYNCR, but he broadened the comment to include Rosalynde AINSLIE and others, and of course there were the recipients of these girls' affections as well - Africans (usually black) such as Kenyatta and Babu.

2. The JAGUAR officer then added that 3/1's wife was also known to have shared her favors with other black men than 5/1 - to such an extemt, at any rate, that her promiscuity had come to JAGUAR's notice. (I mentioned that this must be some new news, since we had not heard of it before, but he indicated that this vas old news, and apparently not of the type to be considered "derogatory.") The JAGUAR officer vant on to say that S/1 hin- self has put in a certain amount of time in the beds of other white girls, and perhaps this is how he knows of the promiscuous propensities of some of then.

3. While S/1 has not particularly affected prudery in our talks, neither has he professed himself to be a great and universal lover.

1. On 4 June STEBONY/1 provided the following information on the personal- ity and living pattern of Subject which we hope will be helpful to COVERDALE in mounting an eventual recruitment approach.

a. Subject is smarting with desire for revenge against those who have out him off from all meaningful political activity and probably from a source of income as well. (NOTE: Subject told S/1 that currently is providing his PL with the equivalent of $1,000 per month.) He is particularly angry with , who owes him some money.

b. An intellectual, Subject has never been particularly effective in the area of practical organizational politics. He is rather weak in the sense that in a conflict situation he tends to pull back. In other words he is not aggressive by nature. At the same time, S/1 felt certain that Subject's indignation and desire for revenge were deeply seated in his emotions and he would not be able to rationalize away these feelings.

c. Subject is basically a friendly and courteous person.

d. Subject speaks French and Spanish but no English. His wife, described by S/1 as a stronger personality than Subject, does speak English. She teaches school.

e. Subject has mixed feelings towards ORIPPA, but uppermost is his desire to rehabilitate himself with the Belgian "gauleiter." It is thought that if someone telephoned Subject and made reference to "Jacques" or "a message from a friend in Belgium" Subject would most likely come out for a meeting.

f. Subject has irregular working hours at the CNRS and it would be easy for him to leave the job for an hour or two without anyone becoming suspicious. He works on research projects and more or less sets his own hours.

g. Asked if he thought Subject would be in a position to provide such information on the PCE Pro-Chicom dissident groups, S/1 said that he thought Subject was well-informed and, if willing, would be

able to provide a great deal of information despite his having been pushed aside from active and direct participation in recent months.

2. Based on the foregoing, the best ploy for getting at Subject might be a telephone call to his place of work with the caller using a cover pretext for meeting him alone and deferring all detailed questions to such a meeting on the grounds of not wanting to discuss these over the telephone. If this gets Subject out, then COVERDALE could apologise for the minor deception while explaining that it was required by reason of his not wanting to cause Subject embarrassment or injury in the course of contacting him. Good hunting.

3. It may be possible for STEBONY/1 to contact Subject during his visit to Paris 11 - 17 June. If COVERDALE would like to get a more current reading on Subject, please get in touch with Rufus F. HODIGAST, who will be meeting S/1 on 12 June.

Dear Colleague,

Thank you ever so much for readdressing the letters of comrade Viriato C. Cruz to him in Algiers. We are eagerly waiting for some response from him.

Your suggestions of sending us 100 copies of the English and a further 100 copies of the French editions is most welcome. We will gladly accept any subscription funds here in Indonesia and hold such funds until it can either be transmitted or used it by you here in Indonesia.

Your remarks about devoting some efforts to encouraging the progressive press for Afro-American in the USA were noted. We will discuss the matter soon. (There is no objection in principle- indeed there can't be any at all). What is worrying us the prospects of getting information and articles regularly from any Afro-Americans progressive pressmen. Maybe you have some suggestions and ideas. Let us know, as we urgently feel the need to widen and strengthen unity, with our African brothers in the States. (We have dispatched 50 copies of the second issue of the AAJA to you).

We are just having some material typed and would let you them as soon as they are done. We would like you to assist (we can supply the articles) in popularising the convening of the next Bandung Conference (Heads of Afro-Asian states). Various forces are already working against such a conference and we have to forcefully put forward the suitability etc of a Second Bandung Conference.

Have you any suggestions etc.?

Our Deputy Secretary-General Joesoef who attended the Sixth session of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council meeting in Algiers as an observer, had hoped to call on you in Paris, but unfortunately he was delayed somewhere else and could not thus meet you. However we hope that soon one of our colleagues will have the pleasure of meeting you and colleague Verges and discuss various common problems.

In the meantime, dear colleague, accept our warmest greetings.

Fraternally yours,

Dear Colleague,

Greetings! The Asian-African Journalists Association founded in April, 1963 by 45 countries and Asian African Journalists Unions, took various far reaching decisions and resolutions.

Inter-alia, it has decided to publish a monthly news bulletin; and to set up a Lumumba Academy, which will serve as a centre of information and reference.

The monthly magazine "Africa Latin America Revolution, is of rich a revolutionary content and import that we would like to receive two or three copies regularly monthly. In our turn we will send you copies (state how many) of our bulletin, the first issue which will be ready for dissemination and January – next month.

Is there a possibility of you also sending us back number issues of your magazine, as well as the special illustration-"Revolution"- for our office, and for usage in the Lumumba Academy.

We are sending you, under separate cover, some documents relating to the decisions and resolutions passed by the historic conference; and hope that you will keep in close contact with us, as we are aware that we have much in common, in our struggle against the common enemy-imperialism, colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.

Wishing you a prosperous New Year and further successes in your revolutionary work,

Yours fraternally,

Diamato

We are ridely distributing it in Indo- nesia, and hope to do the same in South Eastasia as well. I addition, because of the foreign exchange problem, we will rather give you names of other interested persons outside Indonesia to hon ou can send sample copies. Or we could do that if you so desire. Please let us know! A little note to the effect that we will distribute and wherever possible in South East collect articles for you, in REVOLUTION will be welcomed and facilitate natters.

We are printing initially 6.000 English copies of the 'the Afro-Asian Journalist', and hope to have an extra 4.000 in French reaćy soon.

Dear Colleague, our struggle is gairing momentum and the forces of reaction marifested in colonialism and imperialis in all its foms and manifestations are on the retreat. Our very close co-creration will further help in destroying colorialism and imperialism, which is the curse of all makind.

Attachment to OELA-43,272
4 June 1965

# 1. Cover Situation.
S/1 was not successful in lining up any cover arrangement in the U.S. Around 28 May he received word from New York of a flat turn-down on his offer to serve as correspondent for Monthly Review. Naro Schieiffer, who was on-the-spot-got this job, and R's chief editor Leo Hubermann plans to attend 2nd Bandung himself. Locally, however, S/1 was able to line up the following sponsors (though none is in a position to pay much for his services they collectively provide him with sufficient reason for being in Algiers; he will let on that his travel costs were advanced him by his wealthy brother-in-law):

a. Cinnamon, a sort of *British Ebony* scheduled to bring out its first issue on 20 June.

b. West Indian Gazette, described in earlier correspondence, will provide S/1 with a letter of accreditation.

c. Institute of Race Relations. This politically neutral, academic outfit publishes a monthly newsletter. Connected with Chatham House, the Institute's secretary, Sheilla Paterson is a good friend of S/l. She has asked him to do a paper back book for the Institute on Africa. Again, though they could pay little for this effort it constitutes a highly respectable piece of cover..

During the last two months, S/1 has explained his income to his wife as coming from advances, expense money and articles for Encounter. This has not pleased her, as she dislikes both the Congress for Cultural Freedom and Laskey, but has at least satisfied her curiosity. To explain Katzenbach's telephone calls to his home (K. identified himself to S/l's wife as"Mr. Wilson") S/1 had to improvise a purely notional affiliation with an American feature story syndication service called "Metropolitan Features". This will help explain some of his iname to his wife, but will not be used with others.

# 2.
The above skeletal dover will hopefully be reinforced in Algiers where S/l will scour around for bits and pieces of work for his many contacts there. His visits to Grippa and Andersson on his way to Algiers will also help to fill out his ostensible sources of income, though S/1 has agreed not to overplay this angle. In other words, he will not pretend that these two have given him any funds, but if others want to make the assumption, so much the better.

# 3.
On 1 and 2 June, Tiffany expounded at some length on the importance of S/1 trying to get an Opposition (Soviet, Cuban, Algerian or Chicom) sponsor for any further cover, such as the researching of a book or establishment of an Afro-Asian news service for U.S. leftist periodicals and/or individuals. While we could easily set him up in this enterprise, we not went to for the simple reason that this would at best only provide hin with a superficial sort of access. what we want him to strive for is Opposition sponsorship that will lead him into one of the nerve centers of the national liberation movement in Algiers or Djakarta. (S/1 ruled out Cairo on the grounds that his wife is Jewish) S/1 accepted this reasoning and agreed to go for a position that holds out the prospect of long-range penetration in depth.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

4. Turnover to Rodigast. After getting S/1's unhesitating agreement
   to an LCFLUTTER examination and his signature on a Secrecy Agreement
   on 2 June, Tiffany introduced him to Rodigast, under the alias
   "Paul Weller" on the morning of 3 June. It was explained that Rodigast
   would serve as S/1 point of contact in the future. S/1 and Rodigast
   hit it off well from the outset, the latter's knowledge of Paris and
   Tangiers-based American beatniks and other intellectuals serving him
   well in the rapport-building process. Rodigast has laid firm
   meeting arrangements for Paris and has discussed arrangements for
   meeting S/1 at least twice during the summer outside Algiers. Final
   agreement on a mid July meeting will be made in Paris to conform to a normal
   pattern by S/1 and arrangements which S/1 succeeds in developing in Lausanne and
   Paris. In the process of discussing communications Rodigast is also
   imparting instruction in good security practices on the part of S/1.
   Rodigast will instruct S/1 in the use of SW in Paris. Hopefully,
   Rodigast will be able to spend a day or two with S/1 in Paris, even
   though we want S/1 to get to Algiers as soon as possible.

5. Financial Arrangements. After discussing all possible alternatives,
   it was decided that the most secure arrangement would be to give S/1
   an advance of the equivalent of $200 for his-travel London-Brussels-
   Lausanne- Paris and per diem and his an advance of the equivalent of
   $600 for his June salary plus non-accountable expenses. These advances
   were made and signed for on 3 June. One important reason for
   the large cash advance was the fact that S/1 was completely
   broke, and he had to make some funds available to his wife to meet
   expenses and pay off a 65 pound Sterling debt to his brother-in-law before
   leaving on his trip. (S/1 will explain the funds as the last of the
   advances and payments for articles by *Encounter* and other publications.)
   For essentially the same reason (poverty) we agreed to make S/1's July
   and August salary payments in advance (to be paid into his Swiss bank
   account on the first of each month). We recognize that this procedure is


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

-3-

somewhat irregular, but we went ahead with it principally on the grounds that this was necessary to head off the security and morale problems posed by an irate wife.

6. In the course of his initial talk with S/1, Rodigast pursued the matter of the allegations nade at various tires in the past to the effect that S/1 is or was a "CIA agent" or "FBI agent". S/A explained the situation as follows:

a. 5/1 was a schoolmate of William Gardner Smith, and with Smith's encouragement came to Paris and worked with Smith on the English desk of Agence France Presse. 5/1 took over the left bank apartment of Ollie Harrington, American Negro cartoonist and CPUSA member. S/1 had a falling-out with Harrington over the apartment (rent), and in what he describes as a moment of weakness he sought revenge by forging a letter with Harrington's signature which indicated support for the FLN (Algeriah nationalists); at that time the French were extremely sensitive to the subject, of course, and S/1's act was designed to hurt Harrington, and perhaps his friends as well. S/1 was found out, and questioned by the French police; his break with William Gardner Smith and that crowd dates from this noment. S/1 had been forced to write an apology to Farrington, confessing to the forgery.

b. S/1 believes that Jacques Vergès obtained the letter of apology (to Harrington) from Smith or from Ellen Wright (an American, white, widow of the Negro novelist Richard Wright; she continues to reside in Paris as a literary agent handling books of writers connected with Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir; S/1 says that she is a friend of Harrington). As for Harrington, S/1 believes he is now in Ghana or in East Germany; in East Germany he has American friends: a Negro singer Aubrey Pankey and his white wife Kay; she is an editor of the East German publishing house Seven Seas (which prints books in English), and is close to Shirley Grahan Dubois.

c. The CPUSA knew of the Harrington forgery and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

according to S/1 told the Cubans about it, since the CPUSA hoped to discredit S/1 and put their own people in teach with the Cubans. S/1 told the Cubans a tall tale which he hopes they believed (among those he spoke to was Roa): he said that during the French drive against the FLN various people were writing letters in support of the Algerians and signing prominent names to them, and that the Harrington forgery was carried out in this spirit.

d. The hostility to S/1 from Ainslee and McGowan had as its origin their anger that Verges had given S/1 a job that should have gone to an Englishman (or woman); they felt that Africa was a problem of the British CP; and so they spread the story about S/1.

e. Rodigast recalled that William Gardner Smith had once written a letter to the Paris Herald Tribune denying that a pro-Castro letter which appeared several days earlier signed W G Smith had been sent by him. At the time (perhaps 18 months ago) Smith told Rodigast, who questioned him on the matter, "Oh, that's an old story." Without indicating that he knew Smith, Rodigast raised the question of Smith's Herald Tribune letter to S/1, who said he had never seen it or heard of it before.

f. Rodigast gave S/1 the recent clipping from Le Monde which indicated that Patricia MacGowan's husband or lover Carlos Lansa had been arrested by the Algerians in connection with the investigation of the Delgado killing. Rodigast warned S/1 that we did not know whether a charge would be made, or indeed whether Lansa had already been released along with others arrested at the same time. Nevertheless S/1 thought the clipping would be useful to show to those not terribly familiar with the details, but who might be favorably influenced by a report showing that the people who denounced 5/1 as a "CIA agent" had also sent Delgado to his death.

7. Questioned on his residence status vis a vis French and Swiss authorities, S/1 said:

a. He feels he can come and go to Switzerland without


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

problems. When Revolution was closed com by the Swiss, 8/1 was called
in and notified that he had three months to leave the country because
of the undesirable nature of his activities; the Swiss told Nils
Anderssen informally that should S/1 change to a "desirable" activity
he would be allowed to stay. Following his departure on what S/1
considered very polite teras (i.e., the three-month notice period),
S/1 traveled regularly to Switzerland (once a month, on Revolution
business), although he tries to arrive by means which expose him to
minimal border checks (train rather than plane, and Trans Europe Express
best of all) and while in Switzerland lives with friends rather than
in a hotel to avoid having to fill out police cards. (S/1 was notified
of his expulsion in September 1963 and left in December before the
deadline. His most recent trips were in January-February 1965.)

b. S/1 was never arrested by the French, merely
interrogated on the Harrington forgery charge. He has resided in
Paris since that time. During the early stages of S/1's suit against
Vergès for payment of back wages, Verges' attorney said in open court
that S/1 had been in France illegally (as he had no carte de sejour;
he could not obtain one since Vergès never agreed to a work contract
which would be required at the time of application for a carte de sejour).
(In connection with the Verges suit: S/1's French lawyer Pierre
Schwarzenberg, has not pressed the charges; hés is a Communist and
an old friend of Vergès, and told S/l he believed he could obtain a
settlement through persuasion. S/1 has already paid Schwarzenberg's
fee (the money was obtained from S/1's brother-in-law), and does not.
know whether he can whip up Schwarzenberg's enthusiasm. Should S/1
win a judgement for the some $5000 owed to him, he could force Verges!
bankruptcy (there is a printer in the same legal position who has
not insisted on payment because he is reluctant to bring on bankruptcy).
S/1 says that it is possible that if he engaged a first-class non-Communist
attorney in France (who would have to be paid in advance) he night achieve

this goal, but it is not certain that he could get the original fee
back from Schwarzenberg.

8. For future contacts, Redigast gave S/1 "an alias I am using:
   James Sunderland, c/o American Express, 11 rue Scribe, Paris 9, the
   "c/o American Express" being optional. Rodigast will also look into
   the possibility of emergency contact via want ads placed in Alger
   Republicain or Le Peuple (the latter is preferred by 5/1), which Rodigast
   believes will be purchased and read daily by LCPIPIT during the summer
   anyway-- they arrive in Paris a day or two after publication. S/1
   could advertise for a stenographer able to take perfect English shorthand,
   for example.

SECRECY AGREEMENT

1. I, *Richard Gibson*, understand that upon entering on duty I am undertaking a position of trust in the Organization responsible for intelligence relating to the security of our country. I understand that in the course of this association I will acquire information about the Organization and its activities and about intelligence acquired or produced by the Organization.

2.

In addition, however, as I am undertaking a position of trust, I have a responsibility to the Organization not to disclose any classified information relating to the Organization without proper authorization.

I further understand that this undertaking is a condition of my association with the Organization, that its violation may subject me to immediate dismissal for cause or to other appropriate disciplinary action, and that this undertaking shall be equally binding upon me after my association with the Organization as during it.

4. I understand that the burden is upon me to ascertain whether or not information is classified and if so, who is authorized to receive it, and, therefore, I will obtain the decision of authorized officials of the Organization on these points prior to disclosing information relating to the Organization, and failure to obtain such a decision will be grounds for my dismissal.

5. I understand that my unauthorized action or verbal or written utterance which would reasonably be expected to result in publicity on intelligence or intelligence activities would be in violation of government and Organization regulations and would be grounds for my dismissal.

6. I understand that there are established procedures within the Organization permitting appeal at all times of any legitimate criticism, grievance, or complaint and that to carry any such grievance or complaint which I may have outside the Organization will be considered a violation of the undertaking set forth above in paragraph 3.

7. I further understand and agree that my association with the Organization is conditioned upon my understanding of and strict compliance with the Organization security requirements.

8. I will not undertake to publish or participate in the publication of any information or material relating to the Organization, its activities, or intelligence activities generally, either during or after the term of my association with the Organization without specific prior approval by the Organization.

0 JAGUAR Report on STEBONY/1

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

JAGUAR had made the following available to us, in response to our request for information on a continuing basis relating to STEBONY/1:

"In mid-Kay STEBONY/1 was still trying to arrange a visit to Algiers this summer on the strength of help he has received from 'some comrades'.

"Robert WILLIAMS in Havana has given STEBONY/1 the impression that he may visit Algiers as a member of a Cuban delegation. Also, STEBONY/1 understands that William WORTHY, who has been in Hanoi, will be going to Algiers. STEBONY/1 expects to meet a number of his friends there and his main reason for wishing to make this trip is to discuss his problems, past and present, with these friends and other interested parties. He hopes to clear up doubts and uncertainties and, in this context, he has commented that one of the reasons for much of the hostility shown to him has been the reluctance of others to involve themselves in the differences which arose between himself and Jacques VERGES because the latter was clearly more influential and more important than STEBONY/1.

"STEBONY/1 had heard that VERGES was still insisting that STEBONY/1 wes & KUBARK agent and that Nils ANDERSON and Jacques GRIPPA were ODYCKE double agents'. GRIPPA, who is leader of the pro-Chinese Communist group in Belgium, is planning to bring up-to-date his book Marxism-Leninism or Revisionism', published two years ago, by adding a new chapter. STEBONY/1 is looking into the possitility of its publication in the UK or PBPRIG and, in this context, he considers 'Monthly Review' to be the only possible medium although Leo HUBERMAN, one of the publication's editors, is not enthusiastic about the idea."

ABSTRACT

MICROFILM

London Station was able to make only a single copy of the list, and, due to its bulk and the length of time required to copy it, we have not retained a copy. We doubt that the entire list, which runs to several thousand names (mostly in the U.S.) would be useful to Paris Station, but Headquarters may be able to supply an extract of names to suit your noodo or the whole thing, if you wish.

FROM Chief of Station, London

SUBJECT STEBONY KUDESK QEFREY
Cover Possibility for STEBONY/1

1.  During a recent meeting, STEBONY/1 called my attention to the book *Political Africa*, by honald SEGAL, published London 1961 by Stevens and Sons, Ltd. STEBONY/1 used the book to look up a brief bio squib on, as it happened, Patrick Duncan. He conmented that the book, although out of date and far from objective (one of the collaborators was Rosalynde AINSLIE), was extremely useful to his.

2.  I subsequently got a copy of the book, and find it useful. Nonetheless, it is far out of date. It would appear that there is a great need for an up-dated version, more comprehensive and more objective. STEBONY/1 might be the ideal person to work up such a book (he could even put some of his wife'r talents to work, in such a project), and, in turn, such a project could augment nicely his cover for, say, a year.

3.  For Headquarters consideration then, the following suggestions Contact Praoger (who published *Political Africa* in the U.S.) or another appropriate firs, and lay on a commission to compile such a compendium of facts, figures and faces on the African scene. Have them in turn commission STEBONY/1 to do the job, and provide his with enough of an advance to help cover his needs for a period of a year, say, starting after STEBONY/1'8 summer in Algiers. (Alternatively, of course, STEBONY/1 could be instructed to come to Praeger with such a proposal, which we could encourage Praeger to accept.) This could run concurrently with STEBONY/1's newe-letter, if it materializes, and without any apparent conflict. It could also afford him additional cover for travel and interviers, as well as funds. And a useful reference tool could result.

4.  This is just a suggestion, but we'd like to know what you think of it.

MEMORANDUM FOR: See Distribution

FROM: CA/CF; CI/ICG

SUBJECT: Richard Gibson

1.  Areas of Knowledgeability. A reading of the transcription of Gibson's taped debriefing clearly underlines KATZENBACH's assessment that Gibson possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of personalities and groups ranging from Zanzibar to the U.S. It is not always clear from the debriefing to what extent Gibson enjoys either a first-hand know-ledge or even a friendly relationship with specific individuals or groups. What is clear is that Gibson moves in a milieu on which we presently have very little coverage; that he is already a member of this loosely defined society and thus can be presumed capable of de-veloping new contacts or strengthening old ones by means of present ad past associations.

It is difficult to categorize or devine what this milieu is. It is not the world of communist parties -- although it contains a pre-ponderance of communists; and it does not seem to be a society which necessarily revolves about the Chinese. The primary common denomina-tor covering most of the personalities involved in Gibson's reporting is some association with the revolutionary movement in Africa -- parti-cularly Algeria. A secondary means of characterizing these contacts is a correlation with the radical French and Belgian left which lies out-side such organized party structures as the PSU, PCF, BCP. (His main access to Chinese communists runs through Jacques GRIPPA in Belgium and Nils ANDERSSON in Switzerland with whom he claims to be on good terms at the present time.) Another common thread, almost as general, is asso-ciation with Trotskyism, although the meaning or clarification of this political description is never spelled out. In general, Gibson displays a good and often personal knowledge of target areas which might be grouped as follows:

a. African exile revolutionary circles in France, Algeria and London, including the PAC, ANC, MPLA, MPA, and other less organized pockets.

b. European leftist sympathizers of the liberation movement in Africa.

c. Algerians or Algerian contacts in Europe who were asso-ciated with the var for independence.

d. Algerian personalities currently active or occupying official positions in Algiers.

# SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

# SECRET

-2-

e. The exile American Negro community.

f. Minor political writers and polemicists in exile
leftist circles in Europe.

## 2. Access and Limitations on Access.

There apparently has been circulated a charge that Gibson is a CIA agent. (This is reflected in his 201 as dating from his days with the FPCC.) In dealing with this question, however, KATZENBACH cites Gibson's own belief that he is still able to operate in the circles which would be of interest to us. It is, of course, difficult to tell from his debriefing the extent and seriousness of this charge against Gibson, insofar as it affects his bona fides. It does seen that in Gibson's milieu, gossip, personal attacks, muddled loyalties and an aura of conspiratorial confusion are everyday facts of life and that personal contact and effectiveness in building rapport would far outweigh such critical personal charges -- which, indeed, probably circulate about most people. At the present time, for reasons not entirely clear, Gibson feels that he would be unwelcome and restricted were he to visit Ghana, and, in fact, would not like to make such a trip. He has indicated, on the other hand, that he has friends in Algeria and believes he could probably get some kind of job there or at least find a receptive and generally friendly reception. He also appears to have some contact and standing with the Indonesian government, since he claims their London Embassy offered him employment. It is not known to what extent he might be able to parley such a contact into employment in Djakarta or some form of official association in Europe, although these questions could be explored further. The termination of his association with Revolution and Verges would not, according to his account of it, discredit him in the eyes of those who might have been partisans of the ideological line which this magazine purveyed. According to his account, Verges is not in good standing with the pro-Chinese like Grippa or even the Chinese, and that his (Gibson's) quarrel with Verges over unpaid salary is well known. While this may not be unbiased, it is apparently true that he has lodged a claim for payment against Verges, and thus is not in the position of having been expelled from Revolution for ideological deviation. As Gibson recounts it, it is Verges, not he, who is discredited.

## 3. Motivation and Readiness to Cooperate.

The debriefing reflects between the lines what KATZENBACH judges in his covering dispatch to be a readiness to collect information for us knowing that we are an official agency and probably suspecting that ve are KUBARK. His professed motivation is monetary, and frankly so, although a certain degree of fatigue with his past profession of ideological punditry is discernable. There are also a number of indications that Gibson would like to rehabilitate himslf lest he be forced to make his living for an indefinite period of time in an environment that he finds both unpleasant and materially un-rewarding. It is not possible, of course, to make an intelligent judgment from this debriefing on the firmness and consistency with which he

# SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

SECRET

- 3 -

might undertake continuing assignments for us, but this is not an unusual area of uncertainty with a new agent and one which a probationary period should dispel. (It should be noted that in one instance, he volunteered a name as an operational lead -- 1.e., as someone whom we might find it worthwhile to look up. He also provided what is apparently an accommodation address in Bogota for Chinese mailings.)

4. Long-Range Usefulness and Initial Targetting. Gibson's long-range usefulness, of course, would depend not only on his effectiveness and dependability, but on the opportunities which will emerge and take shape as a result of his initial activity. As a general proposition, he can be viewed as an intelligence collection asset targetted at radical independence movements, pro-Chinese personalities and organizations, and official personalities in newly emerged countries, primarily in Africa. Specifically, these targets would include:

a. PAC and ANC: Gibson claims to have friends in both.

b. FIN and Algerian government and publishing circles.

c. Afro-Asian Journalists Association, and by extension, other Afro-Asian groups, such as exist or promised in youth, labor, women, and so forth.

d. Pro-Chinese European parties, including the Belgian (he claims to have access to Grippa), the Marseilles faction and the Swiss activity of Nils Andersson.

e. By extension from these, although at present only a remote possibility, developing Chinese propaganda and intelligence instrumentalities.

In the short range, a current assignment for us should meet the following criteria:

a. lend itself to probationary exploitation;

b. not tie Gibson down indefinitely to one location or involve him in an identification with one faction, group or party that would limit his later flexibility;

c. permit him to respond to targets of opportunity as we may define them, both to have a maximum test of the range of his capability and access, and to probe for the best long-range use ve can put him to;

d. enable him to build his bona fides and his contacts as ve may direct.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

SECRET

-4-

The best likely assignment to fulfill these requirements is that of a journalist, preferably operating from Europe, capable of credible travel in Europe, Africa and even Asia, with some associations which will preserve his bona fides with target Afro-Asian grouss. Assuming the development of adequate cover, he could then spend an initial period this spring and summer in Algeria to cover the Second Bandung Conference (29 June) and the World Youth Festival (28 July). (Other international conferences, including followup AAPS0 meetings to the Ghana Congress in May, an Afro-Asian Journalists Conference or further PAJU meetings cannot be anticipated as targets at present either because of indefinite, planning or because of unsuitable location. There is little doubt, however, that additional meetings will take place in Algiers and Africa bringing together interesting target personalities from Africa and Asia whom Gibson might attempt to report on.) In addition to his contribution in coverage of these meetings he might also attempt to develop his access and contact among the official Algerian community at least with the value of developing biographical and operational support data.

5. Proposed for Discussion. The following questions seem to present themselves for discussion at this time:

a. decision on the continuation of support to Gibson on a probationary period;

b. determination on targetting for initial probationary and possible long-range employment;

c. mechanics of establishing a project;

d. timetable for assignments.

Plans for the Sale of "Afro-Asian Journalist"
in Europe

201-306052

Richard GIBSON, the former editor of the pro-Chinese Communist publication "Revolution", left London towards the end of January 1965 and returned in the second half of March, having visited Lausanne, Milan, Rome, Paris and Brussels. During his travels he met Nils ANDERSSON, who was formerly connected with "Revolution" in Lausanne and Jacques GRIPPA, the leader of the pro-Chinese dissident group of the Belgian Communist Party. Since his return to the U.K. he has made proposals to the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association for these persons to receive copies of the Association's publication, "Afro-Asian Journalist". He has also suggested to the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association that copies of the publication should be sent to the following: -

1. Bulletin d'Information Marxiste-Leniniste,
   11, rue du Landry,
   Clichy,
   France.

2. The English Bookshop,
   42, rue de Seine,
   Paris 6e.

3. Nuova Unita,
   Piazza Cavour 2,
   Milan.

4. Marxtisch-Leninstisch-Centrum,
   Postbus 1505,
   Rotterdam.

5. It appears that GIBSON is trying to establish contacts in Europe with the object of expanding sales of the English and French editions of "Afro-Asian Journalist".

PROCESSING

1.  Ref forwarded the tapes and a rough transcription of the debriefing session with Subject, which were held on February 17, 18, 19, 23, 1965.

2.  In accordance with Headquarters' instructions, these meetings were kept on a don't-call-us-we'll-call-you basis - in fact GIBSON was given no means for calling us. Also in accordance with Headquarters' instructions, we did not pay GIBSON at a constant rate of over $100 per hour. The first ($300) payment to GIRSON was in fact more than we had originally intended to give him as a "binder", but in light of the imminence of his trip to Europe we advanced him that sum to help him to meet his expenses. This nicely coincided with our own time table, since the time he was gone some three weeks - should have provided adequate time for the initial tape to be reviewed and for requirements to be prepared and pouched to the field. At any rate, the total sum given to GIBSON, for his time and a shot at his mailing list, was $700.

3.  LCHARVEST may well feel that it has been done out of $700 in COA funds. The information obtained on ChiCom contacts of GIBSON, or on any ChiComs at all, was slight. GIBSON claims not to have had more than very little contact with them, and not to know too much about them. Unless there is hard info to the contrary, we are inclined to believe that GIBSON was telling pretty much the truth in this respect, as indeed seems to have been the case almost all of the time. While this is a bit of a disappointment, in a way, and seems to lessen the immediacy of LCHARVEST interest, it certainly does not appear to eliminate GIBSON's potential worth.

4.  The London Station continues to feel that GIBSON has considerable potential as a source of positive intelligence on a wide range of targets - targets that appear to be only lightly covered otherwise, although we are not always able to judge this. A review of this debriefing can only cause one a certain amount of amazement at GIBSON's encyclopedic knowledge of many, many groups, personalities and parties of the far left, literally from America to Zanzibar. We leave it to Headquarters, of course, to evaluate.

his material; to the London Station, however, it appears to be not only
rather massive but detailed as well. He do not doubt that he will be
caught out from time to time on facts, and perhaps interpretations as well.
But the totality of his information and the whole performance was without
notes is astonishing.

5. Several points should be noted. First of all, a conscious effort
   was made to show GIBSON that his comments on the American scene were not
   being made a matter of record. (I took notes during our talk, and always
   stopped making notes when such a topic came up.) This is, as KULPA noted in
   OFLW 1903 of 12 February 1965, an area of sensitivity with GIBSON. The only
   times that GIBSON really became emotional were when he talked about the
   American soene, his involvement, and the involvement of his close associates.
   And he kept reverting to the topic, and his involvement in it, throughout
   our conversations. We did not share CULPA's impression that GIBSON'S
   dissatisfaction with the state of racial relations in America makes him
   generally anti-American. He does say that he would not like to be living
   in America for the coming year; but in the context of one who does not wish
   to be caught up in a period of growing violence, which GIBSON appears not to
   believe to be the solution to the problem. He states: "I can understand
   how they feel that way, I can recognize the problems, but I sure don't know
   what the solution to the problem is." His judgments on Negroes in the front
   of the racial struggle (Walter Bowe, Kalcolm X, etc.) reflect not only ar
   intimacy with the problem and a genuine concern, but also a generally
   reasonable and real understanding of many of the forces at work. GIBSON
   tends to condemn individuals - he spares no sympathy for the FBI, under
   standably but he does not appear to condemn the United States as a whole,
   nor even the United States Government as a whole. At the same time, he
   makes no phoney protestations, either.

6. Regarding Cuba, GIBSON showed a similar emotional involvement (he
   acknowledges "my pro-Castro bias") but, withal, manages to give a more
   balances portrayal of the situation than many rabidly anti-Castro
   commentators. (Cuba, and Cuban matters, were also similarly low-keyed by
   me during our talks.)

talkea

7. Where GIBSON really comes into his own, and really astonishes with
   the breadth of his personal information and understanding, (and largely, it
   appears, without the same personal involvement and bias) is in African
   affairs (especially in left-wing fields, European Trotskyists and
   Communists and their general milieu, and Chinese-oriented international
   front organizations. Similarly he appears to be informed on certain ChiCom
   efforts at subversion and propaganda in Latin America.

8. Rather as if reading our thoughts, GIBSON offered to recruit him-
   self. He didn't get too specific, and neither did we. e. But he did make it
   quite clear that he would be willing to collect information for us, knowing
   only that we were ODYCKE, probably suspecting that we were KUBARK, and
   probably equally doubting (because he knows the difference (that we were
   ODANVY. His motivations can be compiled from his own words. He has for
   some time been unable to find a suitable job here in London, He has есоnоmіc
   pressures working on him - now exacerbated by the fact that his wife has
   caused her brother to withdraw some of the support that he had been
   providing. Venal? Opportunistic? Or someone who has a wife and two kids
   to support, and no job for the past eight months? GIBSON acknowledges that
   he has become somewhat bored with the "rpro-biology" of chasing petty
   ideological differences, the kind that make factions of six members or less.
   At the same time, he acknowledges that he has to have a job, and that his
   access to and knowledge of these persons and groups are marketable
   commodities. His preference, he says, would be to have a nice quiet
   journalistic or public relations job here, but his efforts to find such a
   job have been fruitless. How, obvicusly, can one of his background and
   talents better employ than then as a celiector and reporter of information?
   He says that he would like rublic relations or irass work for the Wi, perhaps,
   or an ODYCKE agency, but he is certain that he could never get the requisite
   security clearance. Still, obviously, he suspects that an "irregular" arm
   of ODYOKE, such as we, might be able to work something out.

9. How about his ideological motivation? We had hoped for some more concrete expression than we got, on this score, but what we have is not too bad. He states that he will not be "intellectually dishonest" to the point of becoming a "professional anti-Communist," by which he means a propagandist. At the same time, he agrees that he has no desire to be a professional revolutionary. Again we note that he is not blindly or unduly critical of ODYOKE. Granted, he criticizes many elements of ODYOKE policy and tends to defend some enemies of CDYCKE. A failure for him to do so would be sufficiently remarkable to make us totally suspicious of him. Note further his comment that he would havebeen perfectly willing to talk to us a year ago in Faris in the same fashion as he has here. This would sound rather suspicious and difficult to believe, were it not for the fact that he did show himself to be candid and cooperative in his Paris interview with a FBSWING officer.

10. How badly blowm is GIBSON, then, if we are thinking of using him. After all, he has been publicly labelled a "CIA agent." Could he, then, work for AUBARK successfully? GIBSON himself is certainly a better judge of that than the London Station, and we feel that there are only two indices that can be used to judge the matter. The first and most immediate is GIESON's own opinion, since he has lived with the problem, and has tested the idea in practice. He feels that he could still operate ("Love" is his tern) in most of the desirable arees successfully, provided he has adequate cover for being where he is and doing what he does. The second inder would be for us to test his continuing access to targets of interest. It should not take too long to make such a test without putting anything into real jeopardy.

11. Cover for GIBSON, of course, would be a serious problem. He himself proposes the obvicus answers: some kind of vaguely left journalistic tie-up. We should think that such cover could be arranged. And we propose to disucas a number of possibilities with Headquarters in due tine.

12. Utilization and lccale are most closely related, of course. From our vantage point here, it would appear that Algiers would be the rost desirable home base for GIBSON. Fe could range out from thers into Europe or the rest of Africa (the two best targets, apparently) and maintain a reguler flow of information on Algerian affairs while "at home." He has spoken several times of the ease with which he is integrated into the Algerians environment, and he has a fairly well established base there from which to expand his operations. He has said that he would be willing to go there, or France, or most any other place where his children can continue their education in French. And Algiers appears to be, for the foreseeable future, a worthwhile target in its own right, as well as the site of a growing number of internationel front organization meetings, for which GIBSON would appear to have exceptionally fine credentials. As he says, he could go elsewhere in Africa, but Algiers is where he would fit best. We would be inclined to keep him, for the kost part, away from the Cuban milieu (except, perhaps, incidentally) to avoid straining his reportorial objectivity. In the African, Buropean, and international front areas, we suspect that careful checking would ensure such objectivity.

13. His utilization could best be considered on a straight information-collecting basis. To use him as a propaganda tool would be not only repugnant to him but destructive of his utility as well. Presumably he could be permitted to continue to write, not only for his overt emplyers (in a straight news fashion), but perhaps occasionally for leftist periodicals of his own choosing, in order to maintain his own cover. (This is, admittedly, seeing rather far into the future.) We do feel, however, that GIBSON could be an admirable and highly valuable collector of positive information on that whole spectrum of the left with which he is already so familiar.

14. GIBSON and security, to this point: GIBSON has met only myself, under alias, and under the impression that I was here temporarily. This idea was apparently made to stick, throughout our conversations. We would propose that, if GIBSON be recruited in fact, he be handled in alias and at a good, safe distance - more than arm's length. Until sufficient operational testing had been carried out, we would suggest that he not have a "resident case officer" anywhere - i.e., neither here nor in Algiers. Control of GIBSON is partly exercised by the documents we have received from him (receipts, memo of understanding) plus the voluminous taped comments. These, while not worthy of a court, are sufficient to do him considerable professional and personal damage - note particularly that his wife, according to him, would not approve of any of our contacts, and this appears to be quite meaningful to him. Financial control would be a continuing factor. And, perhaps to an unusually high degree, we feel that GIBSON would feel considerable gratitude to whoever (i.e., KUBARK) rescued him from his present and difficult position, "forgiving all", and providing him with a measure of respectability (at least in his cwn eyes) that he has henceforth been, unable to achieve and maintain. In sum, we feel that a reasonably strong combination of control factors exist, and can be continued for as long as GIBSON would be properly handled.

15. We should also like to comment on the reliability of GIBSON's comments in the course of our meetings to date. We have found him to be thoroughly consistent in his comments and attitudes throughout. We found no indication of deliberate deception or serious attempts to mislead. He may have provided some erroneous materials, or he may have erroneously interpreted some events; but his comments and attitudes remained sufficiently consistent to lead us to believe that he was being reasonably honest all the way. He played down some items, no doubt, and played up others. In the course of a debriefing such as this was there seemed little or no point in pushing hard at such points - besides, his knowledge of the areas covered so far outdistanced mine that I could not have attempted to probe or pin him down on specifics. (Note also his tendency to make corrections in the debriefing questionnaire, as when the wrong name would appear for a political group in Switzerland.)

16. GIBSON's present status is that he is out of work, in debt, and without any prospects of reasonable employment in the near future. He is somewhat occupied with an article he is writing for *Encounter*; this will probably keep him from taking another job for the next few weeks. Beyond that, nothing is definite. If we would like to give him a try, then, some move should be made to formalize matters with him before he accepts some job that will put him out of the market.

17. Recognizing that there are risks involved, it nevertheless seems most undesirable to pass up what has the earmarks of being a highly useful asset. We request, therefore, that Headquarters review and consider the entirety of our knowledge of GIBSON to this point, and give us a reading on his potential worth, as viewed by LCHARVEST, AF Division, KUDESK/ICG and other interested parties. If, for reasons of which Headquarters is aware, and we are not, GIBSON is considered unacceptable as a KUTUBE asset, let us know. Iî, on the other hand, there appears to be a market for his talents and capabilities, we should move rather rapidly to pre-empt him. His present flexibility is not likely to last for long, and any plan to use him should take this into account. As WE/BC is aware, we are not in a position to put this into the form of a London Station project. This should not be the reason for neglecting what appears to be such a potentially rewarding asset for KUBARK, however.

18. We would appreciate a reply within a couple of weeks of Headquarters' receipt of this dispatch.

ABSTRACT

ACCOM
PLISHED

1. Transmitted herewith are the tapes of the 17, 18, 19 and 23 February sessions with GIBSON. Also transmitted is a copy of the Station-prepared transcript of the tapes. The quality of the transcription variess the first session is mostly summarized, the subsequent ones are almost verbatim. Roberta L. HORRELL did the transcripts, and I subsequently reviewed then, filling in comments, names, etc., that HORRELL had missed.

2. As rough as these transcripts are, a careful review of them is fairly revealing about GIBSON, and about his knowledge of the topics discussed. Further comment from this end will be contained in an operational dispatch. Right now we are anxious to get the present material into Headquarters' hands for further processing. This is about as far as we can take the material here, due to extreme time limitations. We are retaining a copy of the transcript, however, for further use and future reference.

I was in Rome when there was sun.

I had left Rome when the snow arrived.

I had a reasonably cordial reception almost everywhere. I got some information. I didn't push too hard. Where I encountered a little bit of suspicion but not very serious, was in Brussels, and actualy I think it was because Giuppu was so busy there. He said if I could have stayed on a few days, but I didn't have time or money to hang around. But I can always go back and see him again.

I went from here to Zurich, to Lausanne. The only reason I went to Zurich was simply because Nils Andersson claimed that the Swiss had, you know, had been expelled from Switzerland with the magazine, and he said that they had told him that I was interdit de séjour, that is, can't come into the country.

But I have been in the country numerous times since then; but nevertheless I wanted to make certain. I know they know me in the Geneva airport. I went in the Zurich airport, and took the train there, (for Lausanne). And there I didn't stay in a hotel so that the local police would probably not know about it. They probably were aware, but they weren't going to bother, anyway. From Lausanne I went to Milan, Milan to Rome, Rome back to Lausanne to Anderssander again, then Paris, and from Paris to Brussels and back here. Altogether it took three weeks. One could have taken such more time. Actually, it was more establishing of contact. I got someinformation for this thing I am writing for Encounter. In fact I got enough to do what I want to do. (I have to)

He wants.

I would like to follow up - to go on to Algiers, to talk to some more people down there - apparently they have got a lot more information abut Verges. Or so they told Andersson,

of course useful if I'm going to play the money market. But for Algerian
currency it was hard to find a buyer. The opposition has been the principal
buyer of the new currency. / In other words he dared to trigger and the circle who
go out of the country when the change in currency came and who were short of
in hard cash for their people going in and out, were buying this currency.
And this had created a more favorable exchange rate. In any case, at that
time the exchange rate was hardly favorable and you had to give a sell order
24 hours in advance for the bank to find someone. And that was the thing.
The money, he, says that the exact sum in the bank he is not certain,
in that account, He knows that Verges's figure was around $75,000.
75,000. He thinks that was fairly accurate. That is, 75,000 dollars,
In Algerian currency. The money was placed there between the end of July
or August of 1962 and December of that year. In other words it was just
after independence but during the period of struggle for power
between the GPRA and the group. Where he got the money
from as for the second $75,000, Verges said he had another account.
He knows (Anderson knows) as he said before, nothing about this. And
frankly, doesn't believe it existed.

However, he does think that Verges has received small amounts of money,
where from he doesn't know. The Chinese line is ending. In fact, you can
tell from looking at the magazine, the last editorial. He changes-
is
The editorial called Compagnon de Route, which means Fellow Traveler,

This is just what he didn't want to be called. And it ends up by saying
in French-en a fait des compagnons de route-
- we're fellow travelers, we're for a united front of all the liberation
  movements with comprehension but without condescension. It's a much more
  modest, it's a playing down of their own role. In fact some
  of the articles inside the magazine of course are not in line
  with the editorial. The editorial doesn't have Verges's style, either.
  (Who do you suppose wrote it?))

That is very difficult to say. It doesn't to my mind seem to be the
style of either. I would suspect that it was written by .
but for what purposes. Grippa's people told me well, they considered
this a favorable turn, that they were willing to accept Verges as a fellow
traveler but as nothing more, and they told him that long ago. This is
a power struggle. They told him that and what's more they're still
not certain that they want to have anything to do with him. And apparently
it's gotten to be the standard--something that you demand-- they demand
that people who come to see Grippa now are - forced to say "we have nothing
to do with Verges; if we had something to do with Verges, we make our self-

stay some people down there that I could talk to. Apparently they've got a lot more information about Verges and so on. That's what they told Anderson.

(Who told Anderson?)

Oh, some members of the Algerian Foreign Ministry who I think is in Switzerland. He sees a lot of Algerians because he worked with them during the Algerian war, in various capacity. So he still sees them. He has kept on fairly good terms with them.

(You turned up some information in your talks with Anderson)

Yes, some. You mean about source of funds. He assures me that the money was not as I thought it was; but it was in the form of Algerian currency.

I thought it was in stocks and bonds. My assumption that it was in stocks and bonds was based on his statement that he used to say, "I must go to the bank to tell them to sell."

Now apparently what this meant was that they were holding the Algerian currency. You could deposit money in Swiss banks, held as currency at the deposit. I could hold-in pounds and give a sell order. this is

criticism. You know, we do so, and we won't do this anymore."

A number of groups, apparently so. You know, they have created the so-called Spanish Communist Party, Marxist-Leninist, and this was one of the conditions. There are talks going on in France between the Clichy group and the Marseilles group and that was one of Verges again, the conditions of the Marseilles people who were tied up with Kien-nard, that Verges had nothing to do with them. On the other hand there are students, talks between Clichy group and young left-wings, they call themselves the Drapeau Rouge group. It's a very small group anyway. That again was a condition. They put out a magazine, a news letter, called Drapeau Rouge which had been mainly written- it's one single edition- mainly written by Kien. So obviously, the wind has turned very much against him(then). Verges has said, howder, not very long strange things too. To Maspero, ago at a cocktail party, he said, "I don't see why people reproach me for accepting aid from African friends and comrades- African comrades, no longer Chinese comrades. He also says that he admitted that they had made mistakes, that the magazine had been too sectarian, dogmatic,

(Verges said this to Maspero?)

Yes.Anderson told me that.

(When he says African, does he mean Black African or Arab?)

This is what we don't know. We have no idea who would waste that much money on him. First of all, who has the money, with which parties does he have connection. The UPC and the Cameroons, that split. The UPC and the Cameroons, a certain amount of money comes from Russia, other money coming from the Chinese, but very small amounts, because no one wants to pour money into this very divided organization. And he had contacts with one wing of it. I can't see them giving him any money. The Salaba, Salawa party - bugere and Niger, they also, according to Anderson, Mamani, who is one of their executives people, who is in Algiers, and who comes to Switzerland quite often, said that he no longer even bothered when he goes to Paris, to see Verges, that he sort of considered it worthless, sort of an adventurer, an opportunist.

The thing that was for me a bit frustrating in all of this was that every once in a while -- this that and the other, he has always had this equivoque, this doubt hanging over him. But no one has anything hard and fast about him. You can get- well in the past, what did he do. We know vaguely what he did, but nevertheless, what would you say and so


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

his ambition, but his ambition seems to shift from one thing to the other.
You don't know exactly what does he want. When he started this magazine,
obviously he wanted to play a role in Algeria and Africa. Driven out of
Africa, he still thinks he's going to get back to Algeria within a
relatively brief period of time, six months to a year. And he kept saying.
to us, "Oh, yes, we'll be back, we'll be back." He's already prepared a
list of people he's going to have thrown in jail, or shot,
(laughing) or threaten with firing squads and so forth. That fell
through, And now, of course, I suppose it must be extremely bitter to
him to see Bitat, who had been his really, the closest, and Zohardin,
been his closest associates inside of Algiers, with exception of
Fijamia Loubired, but she doesn't have any real weight, politically,
Bitat is back in Algiers, has made his peace with Ben Bella, and now
represents, he's the General Manager for Volkswagen. (laughing)
Anderson's conversation about Verges was based just on Bitat. He said
"Well, Bitat is going back. Isuppose Verges will be following behind."
He said (the Algerian), "No he won't. We have a file on him,"what he's done."
With money, in particular. Apparently they claim that he had been dipping
into the pot for years.

(This is the Algerian claim-) Yes, what they told Anderson.
I think it's probably true. The funds of the FLN. You see he was, after
all, a lawyer and then became the top lawyer of the FLN in France,
that he had access to enormous sums of
the legal defense team, and this
money. The Alger-- obviously and underground organization, even as well-
structured a one as the Algerian cannot demand very accurate bookkeeping.
There were all sorts of very funny jokes about how money was handled, (recado)
written on the corner of a newspaper. And so under those circumstances -

Verges himself has told some things about this.

As for his connection with Khider, Anderson thinks that Khider may have
helped him to get money out of Algeria, but he doesn't think that he got
anything after he left and Khider left Algeria. In other words, he said
as long as he was on the scene and formed part of this vague opposition
to Ben Bella which Khider sought to at least unite on a few issues around
himself, he may have received some money. But afterwards, he doesn't think
he received any. He has no proof, of course. If he did receive, it would
have been small sums given to Janisa Buharee as a token of friendship
more than anything else. That may have explained her trip to Geneva, when
she did bring some money.

His connection with Khider. Anderson thinks he got no money after he left (Algiers).

If any came it would have been small sums given to Geneva as expression of friendship.

This printer has sued for 48,000 swiss francs. He has at NMPP (Nouvelle Messagerie de Presse parisienne) blocked Revolution's account. They had 7.50 francs in the account when he blocked it. They had a previous debt with a French printer.

Amount of money coming in from sales is very small. Herzu Las not contactict.

of Revolution I can do it in 48 hrs. Lots of people want Rev out of business. Question

Question is where does Verges get the small sums necessary to keep going. Nes paying at least 5 people full-time plus the punded printer. Daldueca printed No. 12. it is a high powered firm. what terms of agreement?

13th issue has gone back to offset press, the old printer. I don't know why.

I should have spent more time in Paris. I dont want to overplay my hand. The last thing I should have done was recognize and to question people systematically.

In Paris only important contact Valdes, Spanish. Gave some info on Span groups. Claims they asked Cuba for money and got turned down. Cubans don't have much money.

It's a Great shock to these people to find that Chinese aren't putting in money. It is always someone else, like First Sinet. Verges always indirect. doesn't want to ask anybody for money.

probably through Juan Arcocha, press attache, Paris, former sector of Carlos Franqui, editor of Rev. Arcoa is very anti-Communist, hipped on persecution of homosexuals. Not necessarily one himself. Very interesting

I did not see Franqui. I don't know where he is.

I was getting enough info for personal needs. but didn't want to overdo it.

I do need a better story to travel around on.

Grippa generally was busy, lot of people around, obviously delegations, there was a catastrophe, from where I don't know. Something had happened. He is rather vague.

Shock clash between Grippa and Verges came on question of money. After many months, Verges went to Brussels, talk ended abruptly. V said: went too far, laid down political line, etc. I rejected." But this came only after an exchange over the source of funds. Grippa asked Verges now where he was getting his money, and Verges got huffy. Delegate general said Grippa didn't believe any of the stuff Verges said about me. Predisposed to oppose Verges.

Verges will not confide to anyone - even Anderson, where the money comes, Verges and Algerian money. He Did he just say, just tell them, that he got the money from the Chinese? Did he get it from someone in Algeria but he is afraid of disclosing.

He wouldn't tell the Chinese at Bern the source of his funds.

Verges debts total $30,000? Now he must have cleared away at least the big debt with the original French printer. I said 30,000,000 francs or about $60,000. Castel confirmed that it was about that amount. Castel and I and my wife worked out the estimate. I don't remember the breakdown.

Mainly Printing, photographs, paper, rent. We said between 30 and 40...

I have to leave around noon. my little girl at home by herself.

Wife working in Tunisian Embassy, 142 a week. She is (isn't) very happy there. Not much money, remember taxes.

Anderson: general background- he is Swedish, 32 years old, born in France of French mother and Swedish father. His parents sattled in Lausanne when he was 6 months old. He was raised in Switz. had so little connection with Sweden that when finally had to go into Swedish army had to learn Swedish. Married to woman who is daughter of a prominent Conservative Swiss politician, may be a member of the Parliament. Don't know his name.

Husband does not see her parents. He chose Swedish nationality because most convenient, during Algerian war and didn't want to go into army.

Swiss nationality would cost both money and military service. Therefore took Swedish. In his youth he was involved with literary and dramatic groups, still keen interest in poetry and drama. He is connected with *Theatre Populaire Romande*. His press servée mainly for material for them. About all he prints. He is forbidden to print any political material but he can print or have printed Chinese literature, which classified as philosophical. He can't print October. That cow painte by guiguin in Montseny.

He has never incorporated name *la Cité* -

privately owned press and business, means personal risk.

He is distributor, mainly, for French books in Switz. for some substantial credits.

Most of his things are not political (now) but literary. Not essentially a political operation. Has two employes, a secretary and a Spanish boy who takes care of the press.

He for a time very much involved with the FLM, how it happened don't know. He was one of their principal agents in Switz. He represented the support net work, to do tasks FLM couldn't do themsevles.

Carrying weapons, money, etc. He operated the Swiss end.

Much material was smuggled over Swiss borderat Geneva. With Hensi hellere?

Through connection with FLM probably made first personal contact with Verges and with Maspero. He got into publishing, through contacts with Maspero who was printing books. Algerians wanted these books to continue coming out in French. Proposed that print them. He took to enter auguin who agreed to print and that's how he become a publishit.

He had no trouble. Swiss police thought his life was in danger. From the 385.

Is he solvent? Yes. But his wife works as a school teacher. They have a car. They pay low rent. B "Building of very mixed occupancy.

His father and mother had flat in this building. The father and mother were decorators. Has office on upper ground floor and press on lower ground floor.

His father dead. His mother remarried. Still a decorator.

Dont know just when A started this business. He began in decorating business paper hanging, etc. Then got into poetry, etc. had a little magazine.

He had some money and bought the distributorship of these publications.

From that he went into publishing, *during Algerian war*.

October- A and group around him, established in 1964, summer, after fiasco of the Swiss Communist Party. Extremely small group. I doubt if they love more than 30 people.

Operate mainly inside of the official Communist party-Worker Party.

Aim to convince the people inside of rightness of Chinese thinking and provide a rallying point for those expelled from the party. Print in Italian, French & German Swiss CP has all of 15 people.

I estimate 30 to 40 people involved. Very weak organization.

It might be discreetly financed by the Chinese. A little money handed over to Anderson

A is obviously no longer really the center of it. He was the initiator.

Fact he is not Swiss may have helped. I feel he was gradually pulling back from political involvement. Is under close surveillance by the Swiss police - has been warned what he can and can't do.

People even went up to Berne and asked for his expulsion. They got very little satisfaction.

There still are numbers of Spaniards-- he has Chinese and Albanian literature in Spanish.

Once they get out of Spain and can get this stuff they do go and look at it. MOe no longer exists - has been fused into new Spanish CP. They are just workers. Mundo Obrero Revolucionario produced on offset or mineograph, principally by Tiafer (phon) Tagliaferro in Anderson's office

Catalan. The two leaders are out of it.

Three groups: proletario, Chispa group is third. That has two people according to Valdes The leaders of the other two groups were expelled from this Lenin-Stalin party.

Don't think he still has distribution of October officially.

That's political This ban derived from the Revolution incident.

We could stay in Switzerland if we wanted to but had to get out of all political activity.

Don't know where A still acts as a contact I feel that he is much less active than he was. He was not well informed about Italian group, Nuova Unita

He is in contact with Grippa/and with Maspero but very unhappy about the political line of Maspero's paper.

Andersson's wife: a silly woman - self-dramatizes.

She went to Albania (anniv of Albanian rev.) and some other people from the October group. Went to reproach them for the aid they had given Builliard-Jenvey.

Guiyard. His wife does many things he can't do because he is a foreigner. She would act as his agent - did not go in her own right. He doesn't have much to do with Albanians. Her trip gave him a better impression. But she thought the Albanians bite better informed about Europe and party in Europe than the Chinese.

She at one time was a member of the central committee of the Exxxck Swiss Communist Party. Maybe about 35 members. Practically anybody who joined the party was immediately on the Central Committee.

Andersson is known as the man in Switz to see if you want to set up a base for any kind of a revolutionary movement. Maybe this is how he got in touch with Sepamards.

Some left the Catholic church. I would say their Algerian generation provides the basis for the pro-Chinese element within the left-wing youths of France. The ones who saw the total ineffectiveness of the Staliniste many, disgusted with it and sought to make up for this failure on the part of the Communist Party.

I can perfectly believe it.

cease any activities on behalf of Revolution which was felt as undesirable.

Whether he is still a contact between groups on outside and Chinese Communists in Berne cannot say. He is much less active.

Apparently that was ironed out. His wife does manythings that he can't do because he is a foreigner. She acts as his agent.

But he doesn't have much to do with Albanians, but her visit has somewhat raised the prestige of Albania in their eyes.

I think he would much rather deal with the Chinese.

He may have come in contact with the Spaniards through the Algerians.

He is known as a man in Switz to go to see if you want to set up a base for any kind of ary movement.
Can give you advice,

A has nothing to do with His basically with the Embassy.

He told me had an incident with the Sov First Sec. at the Cuban Embassy last Jan. The Sov heard his name. said are you Swiss English? He said, no, I'm Sundish.
Sviss. You must be the Anderson. Sov. told him he couldn't get away with that sort of thing long. An emotional outburst. Tried later to leave better impression- I admire what you have been doing, etc.

A is known. to the Soviets.

He has been in contact with the Salad Party, with the Eritreang, Liberation movement. That was slight. He is in much with Curiel and company.

I'm not certain he is in complete approval of what Curiel group doing. At one time Ciriel group interested in something in West Indies. I understand that they were ingang to send ams into roitinque and Quadelampe- which one ca get in Surtzerland.

A was in contact with French West Indians. I don't know how far that went.

Here in London Curiel wanted to found a magazine last summer to be devoted to West Indies.

In Oct of 62 before I went to Algiers, but when I came to Paris I saw Sinet who had a large amounts of Algerian currency in his flat. the clost shelves were covered with bundles of Algerian currency:

I'met Sinet in New York when he came back from Cuba. He and his wife.

He came through FPCC.

He asked me if I had time to help him change some of this money, which he claimed was given him by an Algerian friends who was going on a world tour, had brought it from Algiers, but banks did not want to change large amounts He was sending it by various people to airport, etc. small banks, to change a little at a time. This of course was prt of the money thatVerges got, I assume.

Verges had met Finet during the Algerian war, when and how I don-t know. He was too conspicuous to do much in an open way. Certainly helped in propaganda.

He knew Chandioli at the UN, and His Algerian connections very good. He was in contact with Ben Bella.

The Erench govt would never allow Finet to go to see Ben Bella but did allow Finet's wife to go, It was she who took clothes to Ben Bella when he was released, and went to Cairo.

In 62 I was thinking of going to Algiers. I was vague about. He told me all about Verges and someone named Maurice Masquino (ph.) who then was Editor of *El Mujahid*, weekly, official organ of the FLN.

It was actually through Finet that I really got the job with Verges. I had heard of him and he apparently had heard of me, but I had never known him before. I don't know why. This was at the time between the struggle between the GRA and the Tlemcen group for power in Algeria. And I don't know where he was. Again, he played a role in the transfer of funds. They needed money for a large parade. Verges carried the money to Morocco for Khider to Algiers.

My first meeting with Verges about 15 minutes. Talking about an English lang. edition then of *Revolution Africaine*.

Ali Buzuren, later secy of Algierian Embassy in Leopoldville.

First meeting, was in November. 1962

Offices of *Journal d'Alger* had to be cleaned up. had been bombed by CAS. get staff, etc. He in meantime went to Paris, saw people connected with Maspero - Grand Chalia- to whom he proposed: running Algiers as editor. He was careful to make sure he had foreign editors not Algerian.

*Revolution* lasted 18 issues. I have the full file if you are interested.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 137

# Verges-lost-post.

The political section was breaking up. Pritat e Endil disagreed with Ben Bella.

Khider was seeking to use his as secretary of the party to ensure he had some sort of hold but his middle class background used very successfully against him by Ben Bella. Since he came out of his million of small shop keepers and grocers, and there were scarcities. It was easy to blame Khider very much since it was something short. Everyone knew of Khider's speculation with money. Turned out he had $12,000,000 in Switzerland, probably much more elsewhere.

Verges was originally the head of the African Section of the Algerian foreign ministry. After the clemsen group came in. Fave to his African contacts. He did not get along at all well with themisli who was his -was-Ben-Bella's foreign minister. I'm certain, He then at the same time made contacts with Bitat and Khider for money.

Ben Bella never gave approval, but other members of the political bureau did. And the money came from khider - it was in blocked by Khider, finally - Fifty million francs in cash brought in to start magazine.

It went behind Ben Bella's back. Once it came out it was a fait accompli, and he didn't care. Verges. He maintained later he didn't expect to hold out as long as he did.

Djamila Bouhired

His wife under Moslem law, was asked by Ben Bella if she would marry him. She had ferocious animosity against Ben Bella, still has, I think. To all this bad blood - frustrated Evian came into play in the Addis Ababa confidences he was not barges in. When Verges was asked if as of the foreign ministry. He smelled something fishy, and he begged off.
At 11 next morning, with Djamila Bouhireds wife, he went to Morocco and then Paris.

That same evening he left by car, went to Morocco and then Paris.

He has connections in Morocco. Life as the Palace, so I understand, but I don't know who.
Verges always cultivated a myth of big connections. But he does circulate in worldly circles. Claims contacts in Pompidou's office. I never saw any benevolence from Pompidou's office, though.

So he went to Paris and then he came to Switzerlandm and then he started to set up - he had some money, obviously in France... and then he started transferring his funds from Algiers-from Lausanne -- transferred it on his person, on my person - no he never carried any money, but I carried some, and Kessel did too. Kessel claimed that he was actually stopped and searched and that he had this money in 500 franc bills in his hip pocket and they never looked in there. Any way, he did get the money in from Fracne. And he began publication of Revolution as a monthly in September of 1963.

((Had you known in advance what he was going to do?))

No. In fact, it was a question for a while, whether he would do it in Switzerland.

A wanted Verges to set up magazine in Switzerland. Finet was very much against it. I'm certain Verges never intended to go to Switzerland

Harvey immediately spread story that Verges had stolen something like


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 138

very upset when he heard that Verges was in Paris. He didn't like being connected with somebody who had stolen money. I called Verges and said he better get in touch with Andersson himself, better see him soon, because he would keep putting him off. The fact was that Andersson and I went to Paris. That's when we saw Verges. Verges placated him, said there was no truth in the charges. In fact, the charges were reduced. Harbi himself came to London. (The amount) went down, from 300 million to 200 million from 60 million to 50 million, and the whole thing was dropped. Buzerin, the business manager, was extremely indignant about the talk about misappropriation of funds and demanded an audit of the books. They found 6 million francs surplus. That was even more disturbing to them down there.

Habbi is supposed to have said "this isn't swindling; this is an affair of state." Buzerin was then given his clean bill of health and he went off to be secretary (of Embassy) in the Congo, in Leopoldville. On his way back last Spring from Leopoldville -- he was no longer going to stay there; I think he is in Algeria now-- he and his wife stopped in Paris and saw Verges. He had been in contact with Verges and he was very much tried, family-wise, wife this whole Bitat - Zahra Driff codd.

Our transfer/was simply that here we had been working for Verges personally. The money, there -in Switzerland, had been his money and the Algerians never made any attempt to get in touch with us. None whatsoever. There was a letter to Anderson from Chalion, who remained with the Algerians. There was an attempted phone call from them down there- probably Chalion or someone with the magazine- which Andersson refused to accept. So we really were never before the choice. In other words, he proposed (the work); we were doing what he proposed. He was going to continue and the Algerians had no coherent story about the money and what was going on. At that time they weren't interested in the English edition. Later, when it continued, they did produce in Algiers one issue of an English edition, an imitation of ours, which was very badly done. That was the last. They never did any more. That was edited by Patricia Magowan Pinheiro, a half-Anglish, half-Portuguese leader from Mozambique who allegedly--FRELIMO his group is extremely small-- He was kept going by the Jileno people from Mozambique because of the fact that they needed a European to represent the progressive European element (laughing) for when the day comes for takeover by Africans- well, Carlos was waiting for the day when Carlos will be produced as a genuine Hozambiquan of European origin. She was also involved with the Portuguese. She wrote a book about Portugal


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 139

a man by the name of
(under the name, Peter Fryer, published 1962. I can't remember the title. She speaks Portuguese. May be- apparently is connected with the Trotskyist group.
The Portuguese, from what I understand is going on - I would like to get back to Algiers to see what is going on (ferment - splitting - the Eldorado business).

Just part of the iceberg that stuck up above the water. She was close to the Algerians. She produced this one issue. Then that flopped. She had been asked by Verges to go with me to Lausanne to be the joint editor of the edition in English. She refused because she wanted to stay in Algiers, stay close to her Portuguese groups She didn't think very much of me simply because she had set up the publication of the English edition (which) was supposed to have been done in London. And then suddenly behind their backs Verges arranges it Switzerland. The British Communist Party was very much upset about the whole thing. They had thought that they might be able to have something to do with it, that they might take it over. They had a woman who was working for us here, named Rosalind Ainslie, South African, a European woman from South Africa, who obviously - she works for East Germ News Agency here now would have been their agent. It was even going to be incorporated here under her name. Verges was going to be the junior and silent partner abroad. Obviously he wasn't going along with that. This was the summer of 63. At the time of the break with Algiers, she was working as our correspondent here; (she) was extremely upset. She was holding £1000 of Verges' money. She didn't know which way to go. Harbi came here and talked to her. She whole thing fell through. Finally she chose the Algerians and then they dumped her. And she was forced to repay the money to Verges that she owed.

And so we then stayed on in Switzerland. We were perfectly content to stay in Switzerland. Out of the - .

Verges wanted to move to Paris. He had little justification for a move to Paris. He was absolutely delighted when the Swiss expelled us. They gave us three months to get out. It really wasn't any expulsion. We continued it (the magazine). The editor and publisher were out of the country.

Anderssor had nothing to do with it. It was still being produced by Penguin.
Only the English edition was banned. That was to prevent any further publication (in Switzerland. presumably) That's why it had to be done

It was essentially put together by Europeans, (the magazine.) The actual editor which he being Gerard Chalion and she got it from Maspero who now works for a professor Baklima Bemelhart. These are the entire issues that were put out by Verges. His (Laser than I thought) I started 2 Feb. it last issue, 18th May.

I have two copies of these. I'm trying to sell these to the University Just as the best f of California. Don't know what I'll get for this, something between fall be full ect. $25 and $50.00; Verges doesn't even have this. There are three sets.

Andersson has one, I have two. I'm planning to keep one. teme departed puseplanch from Algion- tidut ever take a mailing list. This I got together in Lausanne.

Αχαριστίας I got them out of the binder.

Andersson had a file. He distributed them.

I had to take Andersson with me to the binder to get then out. He kept one.

What I would like to talk to you about (is future work peribility.)

The The Atlantic Monthly.Article to do

They want autobiographic atticle,

I don't nied writing about Revolution,

¿Y : Does this page refer only to the algiers phase?
Do the / Parade, Srisues refer only to Fresh ed, only to Eng, eds, or to both?
What your (2 Feb)
418 May


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

But what they want is a sort of autobiographical type of article.

I don't mind writing about Revolution. Here's the problem. Once I write about-- it's all right for me to write about Revolution. Nobody will object about how far I go one way or the other. What I told you I could put in the public press generally, except for this about the other group but in terms of Revolution itself there's no objection. However, if I have to go any further than that, that means that as far as I'm concerned most of these people will never touch me with a ten foot pole. What contacts I have, do some are more delicate than others- - but I feel that after this trip they could be built up again, after somehow finding some means of interviewsing people relatively regularly. So what I want to ask you is, 39 what sort of ideas-if any, you in relation to me for future things; were you interested in my going, investigating anything further for you or are you satisfied with what little I know now. As I say, I don't think I know terribly much really, except incidental things which might corroborate what you know. Secondly, in terms of following up, if there's anything. For instance, I would suggest, the person to get this Algerian would be Georges Arnault, French writer who was in Algiers and worked on the first issue of Revolution Africaine, and after that never was any more, split with Verges how works in the Ministry of Information and she remains fairly friendly on a personal basis and if that's what you're interested in. who could get me a good deal of information on the Algerian side again through and the Atlantic Monthly, Secondly thereis a possibility that we might both try to cover the Second Bandung Conference.

, the European representative of the Atlantic Monthly, and we might cover the Second Bandung in Algiers together. That's in June if it is going to be held at all. If you're interested in other things, you know, now I have contacts


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 143

# 14-00000

That's why I'd like to know/ I don't know what really, for instance - I've got a possibility - although it's a very slim one- just over across the street here. The Indonesian press office needs somebody. But I don't know. These are little things. Pan African Congress- South Africa, the PAC, they came to see me to know if I could help them a little here in London, in setting up their offices and handling their press campaign. Of course they haven't real money.

(That wasn't so appealing on that ground)

No, that wasn't so appealing on that score. And then also, they don't have a policy. They're sort of wavering between a policy which means telling one thing to the Congress for Cultural Freedom and telling another to the Chinese in Peking, which any nationalist group has to do, obviously. It's extremely difficult to get any kind of a straight answer even inside the organization. And they are going through a period of reorganization, after some highly scandalous, not political offense, but just plain misappropriation of funds, the usual thing that happens in many, many African organizations, It's incredible (laughs). But I think the people here in London, at least on the surface, are somewhat more honest.

(Basically, you're not interested _per se_, in staying in the same milieu.)

No, no. But I'm not interested _per se_, let's say in becoming a sort of professional anti-Communist. That isn't-

(Not either way- either a professional anti-Communist or a professional revolutionist-)

(laughs) No, no.

No. The two careers. Frankly, I do have a feeling, like Walter Bow; I know I feel very bad about someone I know his problems. Only I don't know how the hell to solve them and what interests me is to see- again it is always a problem- what the US government do - what the people will do now that they've got Walter Bow. To a certain extent I'm certain it was provocation, though Walter was game for anything, if you had gone to him and proposed to shoot the President, he would have said yes. Well, he would have thought about it anyway, and probably would have agreed. He would probably suggest that you'd have to fight the President and the Supreme Court along with it, you know. And he's not wild. He's very sensible, moderate boy, except that he has such a it's not a chip on his shoulder, he's got half of the forest, a redwood on his shoulder. He comes from, the paper say, Philadelphia; he doesn't, he comes from Camden, New Jersey. I remember when he was playing jazz as a kid. I met him through this fellow in the Department of Agriculture


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 144

I told you about, Haggard. He was a very good friend of his as well.
Poor he must be very nervous, down there in Agricultre, because he's known me personally, he's known Walter personally, They'll think he had some very strange friends.

Anyway, I'm certainly you asked me for some information which I'm perfectly willing to give you. And if you had come along a long time ago and asked, in paris, I probably would have given the same information. The point was that nobody seemed to want to know. I was talking to an American newsman-- I was wasn't running around peddling information, either- but I talked to people, sometimes saying just the opposite of what Vorges was saying. He never really protested too much about this. He pretended that what he was doing was fairly on the level but it was fairly obvious that it wasn't. Anyway, I- what I want to know, if possible, in a relatively short period of time... I've got to make up my mind what I'm going to do. I don't know how I'm going to do anything, in fact,

But I do not intend, even for economic reasons, to do something which I think is absolutely dishonest, in the sense of writing an article, if someone asked me to write an article about Communist attractions for African students inFrance- in fact the Communist Party has very little for African students in France. It's just the opposite. The Fay - the association for African students, is very resentful of what they consider and they would only love to be enticed and wooed. But this American had an idea which was based on some, on his own mythology actually, of beautiful French white girls being sent to lure these simple-minded boys. In actual fact that's not true at all. I'm perfectly well aware that people have written

The articles which bear no relation to reality, they think of what the hell, they want this sort of tising, they pay for it. The Reader's Digest et one time was a regular market for that sort of thing.

But what's the point. It isn't true and even though it might-'it isn't even good propaganda, in the long run., a titillation sex value, especially the racial thing with sex thrown in- -

(What about your wife?)

Well, my wife, doesn't know - first of all, she knows only once that I was seeing you, and she would highly disapprove of it. Not because my wife is a has ever been a member of any party, (including the Communist party, it's just that she would feel that that would be a highly

Revolution and all
She can accept that.
I don't see any reason not to.
The fact is, the reason we have our financial problem, to a certain extent, but
is because her family is by no means poor/ My brother-in-law, who has carried us for months, has to pay rent, right this week, and she has practically told him we didn't want any money. So now, there I am; you know. This has caused- I respect, I know what her problem is- very often children that come from very wealthy homes-and-her family-
She comes from the poorest branch of her family, which is quite wealthy in this country. It's an Anglo-Jewish family, has a sort of monopoly on kosher food, prepared kosher food here, sort of like a Manischevitz operation- or racket. One of the relatives is- they're all in business.
Her brother, one brother, is constantly having business failures.
He's a very nice fellow, and all, but at one point he made phonographs, now the last thing, he made tape recorders, a little transistor tape recorder, but that's just flopped too. The other brother is a chartered accountant. He has his own firms in the City, which does quite well. He's married.
She gets along very poorly with him. And while I was away, unfortunately relations deteriorated to such a point that I don't know quite how I'm going to.
She's happy that she's got this job in the Indonesian Embassy. The only thing she's not happy about is the salary but she likes the job.
It's not serious. The Indonesians spend most of the time telling her stories about people.
I take a job this thing in the Indonesian Embassy, practically, in a state of war with Indonesia. Although my wife is English that doesn't give me an automatic right to stay in England, not that I'm terribly (eager) to in England. I would much rather be some place on the Continent. I would much rather, for instance..
take a job with some sort of a *bureau* - Obviously that's out of the question, I could never get a security clearance, but I think a job with some sort of international organization- UN, in Paris, Rome, or Geneva, which would be for me, information- I'd be quite happy at that. As for working for an American outfit, I can't see much possibility either, except this sort of free lance business, which could perhaps be extended that I would certainly like, but is precarious when you have-kids, and then what I feel pretty solid commitments here and then 3000 miles of water in between

questions and antvers. Who invited Verges to Algeria in 63)

He didn't go to Algeria in 63. He went to China. He was already in
Algiers. He was in Algiers from the past point of independence, that was
with the clandestine group, that is,
in July of 62.And Verges arrived there clandestinely that is, Ben

Bella, Khider, Bitat, I suppose in October or Noenber of 62. He was invited
to China in March of 1963.
((How invited?))
The first time he went as the Director of Revolution Africaine and
he met with Djamila Bouhired, the heroine of the Algerian War,
and seems an enormous amount of publicity in the Chinese press was
given to her. They in fact had a book about her. She was well
known for her part in the Algerian war and in this is how he got
the interview with Kao, as
he was an official Algerian representative, the Director of Publications
sponsored by the Political Bureau of the FLN, and, I think it was, The
Committee (of) Foreign Relations, something like that that handled
the visit.
((When did he marry Djamila)) in Morocco

Nobody knows. Nodoby knows whether they are really married. This
is again as one of the things that he loves to keep a mystery. It is rumored,
it has been said by a lot of
people that he has a
marvelous marriage we know he was converted to Islam. During the war, the
of the
Algerian War, he used a code name/MANSOUR for his contacts
within the Front. After he came to Algeria, apparently he became a Moslen.
and became J. M. Verges, Jacques Mansour Verges. Now he becomes Mansour
Verges, then it becomes J. N. (Referring to the magazine file)

((When he went to China..))
Here is back already. It must be about the 30th of March. It must be,
because he and Djamila and my wife and I and our children left Algeria
on the same plane for Paris when we left Algiers definitively, he
changing planes in Paris for Moscow, and I going a day or so later to Geneva.,
and not to Geneva, Lausanne.
(Checking on name) uses J. M. all the way through. This was only at the
of his.
This is the last issue, there are sixteen issues here.
He knew that he was under pressure and he tried to protect


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

put himself. He Djamila along with him and himself as a
Comité de Direction Number 1 and 3 to could protect him from the wrath of Ben Bella but it didn't work.
(How long- we wont say when they got married-)

It must have happened in the month right after independence. That's what I think. You see she started beer held in prison, in France, she'd been sentenced to death and he had won her well, he didn't win anything but he managed to keep her from being executed, He became extremely close toher. Not only in sexual life. And this is very strange, his sexual life. I don't know if he has one, in fact. He has a French wife and the French wife has a child, a boy about 12-14 years old and he still is married to the French wife.

By becoming a Moslem he could take a second wife.
((Did he live with her with Djamila))

In Algeria Never, really. he had his own place and she lived with her family.

When she comes to Paris she stays with him and actually they sleep in the same bed. But I dont think that- it's a sort of - a very curious relation it seems to me. Lezat.

((If they were married, they were married when they went to China))

Yes. I don't know about how the Chinese regarded it. They never refer to her as his wife. But that is done very often. He is very close to her family, her brothers. One is in Czechoslovakia,
the other one was in Leningrad, I think, going to school. And it was Verges who arranged for transfers of money. Her uncle is head of the family. Her father is a terrible alcoholic and skirt chaser who has no respect from his children, The father came to Paris and Lausanne one and caused us a great deal of difficulty (laughing). Anyway, Verges has family connections there. This marriage, that was supposed to have taken place, who saw it I don't know. Even the father doesn't know.

He said "Well, if she's married to him, why doesn't she say it.

Why doesn't she tell even me."

He was never really accepted as a Moslem in Algiers. People thought, you know, you don't take a man a man who is a Communist or even an ex-Communist, of his kind, he wasn't a member of the Communist Party, and convert him into a Moslem just like that. And yet there are certain characteristics of his behavior which are very strange to explain. One would say he did it for expediency, like going along with Ramadan, for instance, this is by no means pleasant, fasting- And even in Paris, he would fast, when it was Ramadan, He used to drink rather heavily, I'm told. He no longer touches any kind of alcohol. And this he does all the time, whether there are Algerians around or not.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

optics,

And his perspective toward-the Algerians. He was always talking of going back to Algiers, going to shoot Gerard Chalion just because Chalion had double-crossed him with the staff. He thought, well, since I have these Europeans they won't be able to take over the magazine, so quickly? He's -very clever. He surrounds himself with people who are in a weaker position than he. Kiers,

in other words, a defense.

have to be very strong willed. the things that took place in Algeria, other side,
But Chalion made a deal with the Ben Bella people and kept the entire staff on.

(Revolution in Switz or Pa ris)

Once he saw that the old charges against him on account of the Algerian War would not be that the French Government had forgotten all this, that the Ministry of Justice had no intention of prosecuting not only him, but Francis was sitting there. He was under sentence of death. And Jean, no one had ever bothered.tkar.

He claimed he had contact with somebby in Campidan's office

He had- well the only person who worked with the magazine was somebody in the Ministry of Finance who writes under the name of Jalet. He does the economic section. I forget his real name-- maybe Roget. He handled Common Market things. That's why his for Revolution always deal with the Common Market. Maybe he writes one paper for the Ministry and another for Revolution.

(How long did stay in Switz land)

He never really stayed in at all. He just came through there and stayed a few days, there. And he was traveling on an Algerian diplomatic passport. He still has one. I don't know how he went to Japan, because he had been very reluctant to reply to the demand- the request, for renewal of his ordinary French passport. It was quite possible to have dual nationalisty- French- Algiers. I don't know whether the Algierians (recognize) this. I think that he didn't have a normal Algierian passport, that he only had a diplomatic one, which should, I think, have been cancelled once he ceased to have any thing to do with the government. So he didn't want to travel on it. He wanted to come to London on several occasions but he didn't dare to try his Algerian passport He could travel around much of Western Europe with his expired French passport. Most European passports are considered valid for five years after the date of expiration


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

You don't really need it anyway, just an identification--- will take an expired passport in Common Market countries, up to five years.

How he got to Japan I don't know. He may have finally applied for a French passport. I thought that he still wanted to maintain the fiction of his Algerian nationality, by not making any request for French passport. In Japan he was called the Delegate from the Union(?)

and no mention was made of Revolution. There has never been, to the best of my knowledge and the knowledge of Andersson any mention in any Chinese publication whatsoever of Revolution, and they have mentioned all sorts of two-bit publications that they have financed lock, stock and barrel. And yet the Chinese did purchase it. I understand they do no longer purchase it any more and according to Andersson who had contact all desurtaiso had contact between the Chinese Embassy- and Verges in Paris had elared.

((when))

As of last month.

((when they samed-ceased purchasing))

According to Andersson. He says he has heard it from other people. He doesn't know from Chinese sources. He did tell the truth (was) in Berne, I had written a letter to the *China Quarterly* about the article by Fuks on Verges, refuting what Feito said, Asking what he thought of that. And he replied that they had no objection but they thought it was about time that somebody ended the fiction... that they thought *Revolution* was extremely embarrassing to them.

* ((How long did the Eng lang edition stay with Andersson))

The Eng lang edition was produced in Switz for the first year, the first twelve issues, and entire was printed in Switzerland on the press of this Mr. Gonguin in Montreux. And Gonguin was introduced to Verges by Andersson. Andersson paid him and so forth.

Bat Andersson didn't have any official connection with *Revolution* as of Now. I think, December, of 63. I went back and forth and Strelkof, who did the layout and art work, when went back and forth to Lausanne and saw almost every months, once or twice a month. Gonguin/every months, from Paris. But once I left Paris, the bank account was closed down - I mean, shortly thereafter, by Kissel who came in behind Andersson's back and closed the account at the *Union des Banques Suisses*.

((That ended the Swiss production))

No, the Swiss production continued, but Andersson had nothing to do with it from that point. The twelve issues of that year were printed there.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 150

He represents nothing. He's a sort of hopeless person. She's a very dynamic woman. Verges claimed that she had become a police informer, for the Algerian police, and that she talked to very opposite groups and to occasionally, Skaxzsked to Mamani of the Salava gruix party in Algiers.

But she no longer has anything to do with Revolution Africaine. I don't know what she is going. She wouldn't have anything to do with Verges after the moment that she refused to go to Lausanne. You soo horas

((Why))

Why did she refuse to go? Well, she couldn't leave Carlosy by himself. God knows what would happen to him. Secondly, she hadoto wanted to be all the time in Algiers. She wasnt inersite interested in running a magazine in Switzerland, the magazineinterest was secondary to her.

There was another Portuguese-speaking person in Algiers. That was a man by the name of Braganza. Braganza is a Goan a/Goan who has lost his reason for beingwith the end of the Portuguese colonial rule in Goa, he should have gone it back! But with he had been a Goan revolutionary with the Portuguese opposition. For years he has been in Rabat hooked up to the, at that time it was the CONCP, Conference t Nationaliste des Colonies Portuguese, which grouped together the Filano what later came to be the Falimo and the MPLA. It was part of the hard line countries

There was another one elsewhere which was soft line. Braganza was also sort of adviser to the magazine, Revolution Africaine o and questions of India and so on. He stayed on and worked with Mohammed Harbi and came to London.

2 (Did he have anything to do with Patricia Macgowan)

Yes. They had been together in Rabat.

((Did he have anything to do with Carlos)

Yes. It's all the same crowd. But Carlos was waiting for destiny to call him and Braganza had already lost his chance. The Indians had got ins They'd liberated Goa, so what next, you know. Go back to India. He obviously wasn't going to go back .He was living too well, as it was. And in Goa, nobody knew him in Goa. He was a Goan educated in Portugal. One of these people really without a real national identity. He knew that he wasn't Portuguese and had this feeling of alienation from Portugal, which made him like most for the colonials students there-- the MPLA really started in Portugal- made him an oppositionist. He didn't have enough roots with the homeland. So he's just sort pof fof floating around. His wife is a school teacher. He speaks excellent French. He was working for Revolution Africaine. I don't know if he still is. I'a certain he'll find something to do. He'll never go back to Goa.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

((This points up the need for a continuing revolution, then the revolution is completed))

Yes. You don't have jobs unless you're in the government. And that's a problem, too. In his case, he wasn't even a real revolutionary, just never really did much,

a bureaucrat in Rabat and other places.

(Nor did Macgowan get involved with Verges))

That I don't know. I don't know how he knew her in the beginning, I imagine he met her in Rabat. He used to go to Morocco quite often and had contact with all the African, the race people there. I suspect that's were he met her.

(How much were those guys) So for

Now you've got Harbi. He was the person who replaced Verges. He's out now, but I'm told by Andersson, who knows

has his ear to the ground in Algiers as well as in Switzerland, that Harbi is in a very good position. He is one of the leading advisers to Ben Bella, represents the Left position. He's a Trotskyist, or a Trotskyist sympathiser without any formal organizationals ties. He is very close to the Pablo range.

That's Michel Baptis. He's Pablo, we could'nt have overlooked him,

he's a feature of Algiers life. He played an extremely importat role in the agrarian reform, in, the type of agrarian reform that was going to be carried out. He came down on the Yugoslav model, that is collectives which are privately owned by the collectives and run on the profit model, that is the profitbasis.

Harbi they were all inside of this Bureau des Biens Vacants then which became the Bureau of the Socialist Sector. I once did an article for the Monthly Review, so I know all about how it operated. What really happened was that the Europeans fled just before just after Independence, had rather should have, considering what they had done. But they expected a blood bath. The blood bath never took place. It was an incredible.

That was one of the most incredible things to me in Algeria was that the Algerians didn't Because the stories were horrifying. You know what happened. A month or so before, they were just shooting everybody on the street, trying to provoke then, and the discipline of the FLN was incredible. Nobody would shoot back, no matter what they did. So they fled and they left all their these farms.

It was a question of ploughing and seeding. There is only a certain time of year that you have to do this. This had to be organized and it was organized almost spontaneously locally. And then

This was sort of institutionalized later, afterwas an accomplished fact. They want some sort of a socialist system of agriculture. They


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

didn't know how and the institutionalizing of it was really directed by
these Trotskyists. There was Pablo, Harbi, a French lawyer named Matthieu
from Grenoble who had been involved with the FLN, and he begane sort of
legal adviser of *Biens Vacants*, which was vaguely under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Agriculture which was at that time under Omar Usgan
who is now Minister of State, and Director of *Revolution Africains* at
present. He replaced Harbi.

Harbi is deeply resented by the army elements which are pro-Egyptian. However, the Army, despite its religious inclination had
its socialist bias and would like to see more centralization, more on an
Egyptian model. In other words, they would like to see much more control
from the center than this confused type of regional or local control.
They feel that in the long run the business of the private collective
ownership is going to cause trouble. It's all right if it is a rich
one, but what happens if it's a poor one. You don't split profit, you
split a deficit. Obviously, according to the Yugoslav model, the state
intervenes. The State taxes the rich ones and then distributes subsidies
to the poor ones, but this a debate that is still going on in Algeria,
Curiously enough these Trotskyists have been in contact, very close contact
with the Yugoslavs. As you recall, the campaign, the so-called campagne
de labeur, the ploughing, was made possible only by the delivery of 563
Yugoslav tractors which turned out to the great deception of some of the
Algerians not to be Yugoslav but to be American tractors put together
in Yugoslavia under license.

(This is getting us a little bit far afield)

This is Harbi and this is the group. Harbi represents the leading spokesmen of this sort of Trotskyist-leaning Left group, and his post is
still very high, even though he is no longer Director.

(When was he dropped)

I think last summer. I'm not certain. With Usgan it has become much
more the word Socialism appears in Arabic because it
is felt that Socialism in French doesn't have the same meaning as it has
in Arabic. It's very silly, represents the very muddled mind
that Usgan has. He is very much split between his religious inclinations.

Usgan is a full member of the Communist party of Algeria but
he left for nationalist reasons when they refused to support the rebellion, and
joined the FLN. His wife is supposed to be fanatically religious and has
made him more religious than he was.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 153

((Curious mix-up - this religion and politics.)

Returning to our first subject, Strelkoff. Is he a practicing Jew?))

No.

(Just an ethnic Jew))

Yes.

((Next on the list here is Robert Williams, Whoever made this up calls him an American in Peking.)

He's in Havana. He was in Peking recently and he may still be there, for that matter. He went on a second trip to the Far East, he was in one of the countries that had a celebration. I think he was in Hanoi, if I'm not mistaken. He was in Asia. He may still be there.

Robert Williams is a Negro, former President of the Union County North Carolina branch of the NAACP, who had a hell of a battle on his hands against the local Kuklus Klan and discovered the best way to deal with the KuKlux Klan was to shoot back at them. And it worked. They never had seen it, in that part of the south, anyway, the small towns of the South. Up until recently there's been sort of gentlemen's agreement in the south that the Negro civil rights groups would go into the big cities, where they would be reasonably protected. But they had to leave them much. Williams rural areas alone because they couldn't expect of course, was a great embarrassment to everybody, there is no doubt,

NAACP

and they were on his back. He got no sympathy from the leadership. THE He first came to national prominence after a case of obvious injustice where a white man done something to a Negro woman and a jury had thrown it out. He said.well if we can't get justice in the courts we'll have to take justice in our own hands." But even the fact that older, more Negroes would fight back got the old conservative Negro leaders very upset. He was immediately, People came to his support, particularly the Trotskyites, not the Communists, came in, and tried to give him The Trotskyxites take him over. They did some support. There had been a case before, another case, locally called the Kissing case. Two Negro boys, you may have heard of it, were sentenced to indefinite terms in prison for having kissed a six-year-old white girl. He was involvedin that and again, it was the Trotskyites who came to his support with other Liberal groups.

In terms of organizational support it was the Trotskyites. I heard of him at the time I was in CBS and I thought that it was very understandable and sent him a message of support. I met him at the time of the NAACP Conference in New York in 1959 and when the FPCC was formed he was among the eight Negroes who were among the 30 founding members, to the great shock of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

of the Communist Party of the United States, which did not particularly approve of seeing the two issues mixed, Cuba and Negroes.

Williams, very volatile, a very determined person, on a local level, has no ability whatsoever on a national level. He has become a symbol now to Negro youth in particular, as a Negro who is not an Uncle Tom, who will fight. We knew what was coming in the summer of 61, perhaps it was before obviously embarrassment, for the national executive of the NAACP, embarrassment for the Justice Department, and more than embarrassment, Terry Sanford, who was the Governor, and who told him, "I wish you were dead. Period." Finally, by one of these flukes of fate, there was demonstration over a swimming pool. They didn't want to integrate the pool. They just wanted to swim in it.

But the local people said they didn't want to do that because they would have to change the water, and it would take too much time to change the water after Negroes swam in the water. So they had some demonstrations.

Williams was almost murdered on one of these occasions. The demostrations were getting pretty violent. And then King sent in some Freedom Riders who were going to show them how non-violence was going to work in this town. They decided to make an example. So Williams said, "I'm going to get out of this. I don't want anything to do with your non-violence. But you go ahead and I'll see what happens."

Well the non-violent demonstration became even more violent. There were people shots. There were arrests. There was an English girl who now figures here in the British Trotskyist pasty, who was over there. People were coming from all over, reports in the European press. The rumor went around-

Williams now had nothing to do with this. He was just sort of staying there saying well you see where non-violence gets you-- but there was a report that they were going to lynch the people who had been arrested. As often happens in this type of thing the Negroes and whites, outside whites who were involved, really came in for a hall of a beating, and as in the Philadelphia, Mississippi, case, they have been killed. Williams was more or less a victim of the mob in the Negro community which said "we've got to do something. We've got to free these people, get them out of jail."

He had arms, including some machine guns, which had been purchased in New York and sent down there. They didn't use then because they got scared, but they had arms. The community was armed. The people, out in the street in front of his house, when a car with a white couple, came down the road, It was surrounded and they were told to get out. The crowd wanted to string them up right there. This man came from a neighboring


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 155

"town, claimed, had losttheir way. They said, no you're a member of the

Klan is this town. They wanted to kill him/ or hold him as hostage.

Williams said, "bring these people in my house and you know I won't let
them go." He called the Sheriff, and said, "Look, I have these people here

and my people are very upset and I want you to know that I don't want
anything to happen to our people that you have in the jail." The

Sheriff immediately called the National Guard, State Troopers and what
not. They couldn't hold out very long. Williams escaped. Julian Mayfield
was there, a Negro writer who now lives in Ghana as a result of this.
Minnie a Negro woman from New York who was there;
Botha Mallory, was later arrested and convicted and sentenced to

16 years in prison for kidnapping,.

spirited across the United States-I knew vaguely where he was, but
he kept very carefully by Cubans and by Negro groups in contact with the
Cubans, to Canada, from Canada he was flown by private plane and by
Castro himself, to Havana, where he is now.

On two occasions the FBI came to me asking for information about
Williams, and I damn sure wasn't going to give any of what I
knew. We had tried to get in touch with Bobby Kennedy himself. I had
sent telegrams. I even tried to get a telephone call in. Because I
knew what was going to happen on this thing, to get some kind of Federal
intervention. It was one of those sickening things.

They wanted him out of the way. Even they came to me later-
two of the agents came to the FPCC office in New York. They said, "We have
500 agents. We'll get him. He'll never get away." Well, he was away at
that point. His aunt died in New York around that time.

They went to the funeral parlor where the body was and put a wanted
poster on the coffin to see if he would come. Really, they should have
been thrown on their heads, frankly. If it hadn't been Negroes I'm
certain they would never have done that sort of thing. The trouble was the whole attitude.
Anyhow, as it is, Williams is not a Communist, he's not a
Trotskyite. He's a former Marine, who's just had enough. Really, you
know. And now he has turned into a world-wide figure/because people like
Bobby Kennedy and others could not just/try to see what could be done about
it. It was no use, though. I mean, it's no use now.
I'm certainly and everybody.

Well, that's too bad. Just like the case of these boys, Walter Bow, and
so on. And they're not the only ones. for every Walter Bow there
must be at least a hundred. I must say, I would no more want to live in
the States now - you're going to really see something. I don't really

The twelve issues-vere only 200 copies maximuия, к

It was still printed until No. 12, the-end-of-the-year.. the end of that first year. The twelfth issues were printed there. The twelfth issue was never distributed. only 200, or 366 copies maximus. I still have some. Those are the ones I sold for $10.00 a book. The American libraries are desperate to complete their sets. It was never distributed because Verges hadn't paid Genguin the money that he promised and I, while the copies were sitting there waiting for some/other-financial arrangement the Swiss/finally took action and seized then. Actually the seizure was more "platonic" but they just wanted to said you can't send out anything. I understand Gonguin had 50 copies, of every issue, that he had salted away, He knew he could sell them. I think he could sell them in the States university libraries, you know,

American Libraries are extremely political files. Revolution became a sort of it was the American press, Revolution had a success, it came from the American press, not the French press, or the British press, the American press, It was really fortuitous but I many pinalisto that you can't blame them - seeing this move to Paris, a new magazine with a pro-Chinese line which really was-a pro-Chinese line, coming out at the same time as French recognition of China, So obviously you write things about a new twentieth century Europe, Verges, the Chinese top man in Europe, and this that and the other. And that was what started it' We had three articles, I believe, in the Christian Science Monitor, and of them had the address in. Right nashraddie then the letters came in, All sorts of people wanted them. the subscriptions came in. A subscription agency in the United States sav it, and and started taking orders from university libraries.

The State Department took 20 copies, I think.

There was one airmail subscription for the Embassy in Tokyo.

The Congress for Cultural Freedom had even more than that. They had a list of every one of their correspondents, magazines, etc. Everyone got one. So we were doing well. And he could have, actually, on the English edition, whichhad a much lower cost than the others, he could have broken even. He would never have made anything.

But his policy for the French edition, and all, He could never have balanced the budget without a hefty subsidy from someone.

mainly fictitious names, many of them.

He's got Carlos. He's supposed to be from Spain.

This was a name made up by Chen to replace Valdes. Valdes was actually a person, who is a Spanish scientist, chemist, who works for the CNRS, The Centre Nationale de Research Scientifiques in Paris.

He did write the articles on Spain under Gen's supervision with strong retreat rewriting. And his real name is Lopez, I saw him, his first initial is S. Martin Valdes is not his real name. His address... He is the person who he is now wandering about very much at odds, but he is still very well informed about the Spanish situation. I think that if approached in the proper fashion, he might be willing to talk.

In his late thirties. I had no trouble talking with him, He is very bitter. (Why) He was expelled from the Proletario group which he had founded, more or less relegated. He isn't really made up for practical politics and matter of pride, etc. but he keeps his hand in. He said he wanted to go see Grippa, but he didn't have much idea of doing anything.

He is the one who told me about what was going on in the Spanish group. I could have gotten more. He had no idea that I was pumping him for informations.

He seemed to be approachable, willing to talk about the Spanish situation. He can lecture for hours. He is the professorial type. Not for the rough and tumble of practical politics. He was used by Chea. (What caused his rupture with group))

I didn't get the exact story. He had Proletario. They put out a four-page news letter, most of which was theory written by Yaldes. But was rewritten by Chen was in contact with the members of the group and at one time Valdes and his wife were actually told that they were going to edit Revolution, Spanish edition, which was going to be publised in Europe. By the way, the Spanish edition does exist, I'm told, in Bogota. They have managed get out a spanish edition. It has nothing to do with Verges. It was branch out by the more committee - Movimiento obreros sindicatos & Campesinos a kind of Fidelista movement,

And is getting Chinese subsidy. I think. And which is quite pro-Chinese I think. They had quite a scandal about misappropriation of funds. Apparently the Chinese were giving them fifteen thousand, twenty-five thousand and twenty thousand, and ten thousand of it would arrive, and somewhere along the line on the way to Europe would disappear. One of the persons was expelled.

((What's Kim's loyalty then))
Kim's Chen's- loyalty is based basically to himself. He's interested in Marxisa,

He's very academic winded. He really is a pedantic, academic person.

And he's got a tremendous number of interests. He is a very hard worker when he works. It's he who writes and reviites most of the magazine. He used to write most of the editorials. Verges does very little. He does not like to write. He doesn't like to be bothered with editorial things.

He likes the promotional aspects of things. He likes to convene meetings every so often and to discuss things. But as for the actual running of things though he did exercise a loser control over the French edition than he did over the English edition, he never- well once or twice he said put this in or don't put this in. He printed an article about Algeria which

was veiled criticism, in the French issue, and he told me not to print that, for instance, in the English edition, his story being that he didn't want to embarrass the Chinese. He said that after all the Chinese were buying about this and this was wasn't their line w Algeria and they might be asked embarrassing questionsby the Algerians- Baying why do you distribute this magazine, distributor which has this sort of unfriendA9rafie. pagasinca-which has this unfriendly article.

((You mean the Chinese were buying),

The Chinese at that time were buying 3000 copies of the English edition. 300 the French. They didn't seen to mind z the 300 French

In actual fact, the Chinese so far as I know never made any comment about the magazine, or its contents. None whatsoever.

((Is Chosté villingness to go to Maspero and knock Verges and go th Andersson and knock Maspero- is this inconsistent with his pedantic Marxism?)

For hin a lot of it is academic. It's not related too much to life, except that he is a plotter, a born conspirer. He loves to have ten people around him and to tell then what to do, how to maneuver. Of course whatever he tells then generally turns out to be disastrous for them.

For example, the so-called pro-Chinese students inside of the UEC, the Union des Etudiantes Gesagas Comunistes at their congress last year-- lot's-sea they've got_one.coming up he was the one behind who was telling them what to do, their tactics and strategy. They had a terrible catastrophe.

(laughing) In fact the pro-Chinese students represent a negligible faction nov inside of the Communist students, the largest faction being the Italian The faction, which is actually financed by the Italian Communist Party. Struggle has gone on for years between the French party and the Italian party and it continues there. themselves Then he had a group of youths called the Drapeau Rouge group. They put out who again a four-page, like a newsletter, which he promised to get money from Verges to subsidize. Verges had no money, as you know. One single issue came out.

Proletario, with Valdes, managed to keep on because Valdes had his own (sestrap) sources of income from the Spaniards who belonged to it/ apparently. They kicked in quite a lot, month, you know, to keep it going. It wasn't too expensève. The main thing is finding a printer who will priat it clandestinely, in France. Because all these things-that have-no Under French law you're supposed to have a Bisectors association who is responsible for it and anything in a foreign language is exempt from the liberty of press, from freedom of press, in France. The only foreign languages that you can use are Basque and Breton and I think, Alsatian dialect.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 163

For a magazine addressed to the Spanish workers in France and in Western Europe, the problem was for them to find someone to print it clandestinely.
And they found someone I think with Sinet and Strelkoff.

(What about Strelkoff).

Let's go down the line. The next one in order would be Castell;
-Chastel(?) is the nephew of Joseph Casteli of the French Academy.

((Castollle first name?).
Patrique
Patrick. He is the nephew of a very famous man and he has worked, again, for Maspero. All these people worked for Maspero. Verges takes great pleasure in sort of taking people away from Maspero. He used to boast about the people that he had gotten away from Maspero. I suppose this -- fellow can't do anything for us, so why do you want to get hia?

Maspero bring Maspero down -- he is extremely petty in this sense,
and once he built up this grudge against Maspero, because he felt that Maspero didn't support his 100% when he wanted to buy, and then when he wanted to buy.

Maspero wasn't interested in combining forces. So from that point on he did everything possible in a petty way.
He went to the Chinese and said Maspero was a Trotskist. The joke of the matter was that all of the Trotskyists who had been in this organization, and
I'm sure they are there, came through Chen. It was Chen who had introduced them to Maspero. And Maspero was the sort of person who couldn't care less whether the Trotskyites got in as long as there was some sort of free discussion. He's not a committed person anyway; he's a man who is sentimentally on the left but outside of any party, and for whom this thing has become a fairly good business. Those magazines are by no means expensive. Only sell about 2000 copies per issue, which is all now that sells Revolution- it has come down a long way.

Anyway, Chassel was one of Maspen's authors and he worked for Algeria Liberation. He's been to Laos and to the French West Indies, He's a journalist. He's worked I think for France Observateur.

He's never been a member of the Communist Party. His main problem is trying to be bigger one day than his uncle, whom he dislikes intensely but nevertheless finds very useful, His uncle is very tight with his money,
but in any case he gives him credit He says I am Kessel, and they aren't certain whether it's him or the nephew or son, so they give him credit. He was the business manager. He knows damn little about business, but be-was.

Verges had a great deal of confidence in his and he knew a lot about money manipulation and so forth.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 164

Verges tried to divide things up. On two occasions Verges asked me to change some money. In one case he gave him a brief case which contained $30,000 to cash, and asked him to go to the bank and change it to French francs. I went into the bank and said I wanted to change some money. They didn't faint, nor ask any questions either. Then on the second occasion I think I changed only $2000. It was in cash, in hundred dollar bills. And the other one was in ten dollar bills. That was the problem, they had to count it all. They weren't at all pleased. Where he got the money from I don't know. It was in used American bills, old bills, what wrappers on them had no identification. But he didn't want anyone else to know. He didn't want Cassell to know I had changed it.

(You say Cassell was never in the French Communist Party)

No.

(Why not?)

I don't think Cassall is a person without even intellectual he likes to live well and the party's bureaucratic organization doesn't attract intellectualsm very long. Many of them go throught it but just that. They go in and out. In fact it's almost- it's very good reference if you've been in and out of the party. You've got so many people who have been in and out of the party that you can go almost anywhere and find sympathy and jobs and so on.
People at Expresse and so on are made up of people of that type.
(Does Cassell write?)

Yes. He has written one or two articles for Revolution, but very little. The only thing that he used to do was to re-write some of then's things, the editorials in particular, after then had worked on them, to put them into really good French. then's French sometimes has a tendency to be very esoteric and baroque.

((No substantive editorial work))

No. He is definitely a lesser figure but he likes his position. He likes being the sort of front men. Though be with the financial troubles, he was the one who did suffer most. Because all the creditors got to him. Verges was hiding, didn't come into the office sometimes for days, or would come in only for a very short period of time, Because he was afraid that people would want to serve summones and whatnot on him for debt. Cassell was there. Cassell was not a member of the company, I thought he was.

By the way I don't know whether I got that correct, yesterday. That was the Bureau No. 6 where the- 22nd of August- that was 63. When they set up the company.
(That is Bureau no. 6)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 165

Now Sine,

Sinet is listed with Strelkoff as Secretaire de la Redaccion,
which sounds like he had something to do with the editorial side of it
but has nothing to do with that. He is of course the partner of Verges,
at least on paper. Whether the 2000 thousand francs in his name actually
represent his money I doubt. I think it is probably all Verges'
money. I think that Verges needed at least another person to go into the

*   He is the lay-out, make-up (man), When Verges-went into
    the layout, art work, cartoons, (He handle photos, too??)) Well, yes,
    They look around to see where the can get them. But as they have
    just send
    no money now, it's just a matter of begging. They used to buy almost
    exclusively from Magnum. that's why they had so many Cartier-Bresson.
    Magnum has beautiful photos, except they are expensive. And then they
    couldn't pay them.

((Sinet is French))

His real name is Maurice Sinet. He is French. He is in his thirties.

Martied, rather unhappily; has one child, which his wife claims is not his.

He's more of an anarchist. He was in the French Communist Party but for
a very brief period, I gather. He is very virulent. Before Revolution
came out he put out his own little magazine, cartoon magazine called
Sine Massacre which was the most virulent cartoon I've ever seen.
They depicted things like the clergy, love very, very,
sick type of cartoon, which contrasted greatly from what made him famous,
the Sine cat. He made a fortune with his cats and he also had a tie-in
Sine's-cat.
with some promotional things, Key-chain and others

That's where of course he made a lot of money. He does a lot of commercial
art work. He sells quite a bit here in England. He does work for British
ad agencies.

(Why does a man this successful put this much effort into Revolution?)

Because he is-- again, the same sort of thing- he is an emotional
leftist, very-much incapable of any real organizational (work)-

So is Verges. I think that no matter what sort of organization, he couldn't
stay (with it) too long. He must be the big boss of it. He must be
a grand patron. Sinet is more , much more juvenile. He is forever throwing
bottles of ink you know! His financial success has been seriously endan-
gered by - not from Revolution, but the business of Sinet
Massacre because Mme. De Gaulle did not like what she considered
blasphemous cartoons, and so he was arrested for Outrage publique,
outrage a la police, outrage au chef d'Etat- - He got out of most of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 166

then but it cost a lot of money - it put this thing out of existence and Mme de Gaulle said she thinks he is a very nasty man.

(Does he get paid by Revolution or does he supply funds for Revolution)

No, he supposedly gets the same thing that everyone else gets-getting 1500 francs a month. Everyone allegedly gets or did receive 1500. He has an assistant because he can't devote much of his time to it. He's got to earn a living. He has a very expensive establishment. His mother and father, wife and child, maintains two cars and has a three story- sort of duplex, bigger than an apartment. It is magnificent, on the Rue Plichy in Paris, In order to maintain this he's got to find ways of earning a living, mainly advertising work. He had worked for *Express* which paid him very well, but he broke with them on a political issue. He likes to eat well, drink well and run around after women and this is expensive. So a lot of the work, the donkey work, is done by Strelkoff, whose real name is Alexander Strelkoff.

The main thing to read in Verges are the editorials. That's the only thing ginsberg (?) cared about. The editorials are very-- towards the end for example, there's the phrase - "it's better to have for the future a failure that is luminous, un chef lumineux, than success in confusion" whatever that means. This is Verges' line in many things. They're (editorials) filled with phrases - he wanted at one point to circle these phrases with a crayon to show people that his line has always been the same.

# Reel no. 2

(You have an acute memory for the last phrase of yesterday.)

I happen to be a journalist.

(You have a very retentive mind. You do very well about these things.)

As you get older you forget. Doesn't it frighten you sometimes when you can't think - of a name- I'm really beginning to feel bad about .* something I can't remember- I think my God, what's happening. Strekkoff is Alexander Strelkoff. He is in his early thirties, son of Russian immigrant parents in France,

((Born in France?))

Born in France. Speaks Russian fluently. His parents were members of the Communist Party in Russia, / but with Trotskyite tendencies. That's why they had to get out of Russia after the Revolution but he has no Trotskyist leanings at all. In fact because of his parents, he seems more or less to lean the other way, to be at least verbally, a violent Stalinist. He is married and has three (children), these by one wife, has one illegitimate and several others. He is very active sexually.

He is very handsome fellow and has a great deal of success with girls.

He earns his living as a graphic designer. He worked for Hachette layouts for them, until the great Sinet Massacre scandal, when Mad. de Gaulle finally took umbrage at this. He and Sinet were the two cartoonists who put this out, and

(Strelkoff can draw, as well))

Yes. In those things I gave you you will see cartoons by Strekkoff.

He is essentially an artist, though noone ever printed his cartoons before he ran into Sinet because they were considered just too disgusting for putain. He is really the acolyte, if you will, of Sinet. And any success, any money that he has comes to him through Sinet. He is Sinet's man, and Sinet passes on work to him.

They sort of pass around girls to each other and that sort of thing.

He does, nevertheless, count for a certain amount in the magazine. He did count, because he was considered-reasonably disinterested. That is, he wasn't concerned very much about money. He lives very poorly, with his wife and children, and has made far more sacrifices than Sinetbut he is very loyal, I was going to say, a faithful retainer, of Sinet's. I think that would sum him up. His loyalty is to Sinet and not to Verges.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

((What are his principal types of contact outside of...))

He doesn't have any contacts outside of--. His contacts are mainly body to body with girls. In terms of politics, he didn't like the idea that perhaps *Ghen* was deeply involved with Trotskyism, that sort of thing, but that was just small calibre (?), his scruples. He wanted to keep it going. He was very anti-Chinese in the sense that he didn't think that the magazine should accept any Chinese money if the Chinese were willing to give it, the reason for this being that he thinks that should have a free hand in the arts, and so forth, jazz and all this, which of course he and Sinet are very much interested in.

((He's a literary liberal, then- ))

Yes, in terms of the arts, he would be. He doesn't care much for abstract art, but

((But he's not a party liner))

By no means. A former Communist, but he wasn't expelled. He also just withdrew.

((If his parents were emigres from Russia, I assume this would have been in the twenties, eh))

Yes, in the twenties, just before he was born. because of their Trotskyist leaning. I suppose they were members of the Trotskyist faction* of the Soviet Communist party at that time.

((Do you know whether they were expelled or left voluntarily))

I don't know. I think they left voluntarily, but that's just supposition. I think he mentioned something about it. I think that they really fled ahead of the Soviet police, the Cheka- - he's Jewish, and maybe some of his relatives did end up in Soviet concentration camps. I think he still has some living relatives (in Russia) yes, because he was one of the chefs de chantier, construction foreman, in the final stages of the French exposition Moscow. That was in 61 or 62. He speaks Russian fluently, There we he met some of his relatives.

((His he made other trips to the Soviet Union))

I think he has made two trips. But One was with the French exposition. he was there before and I think throughout the exposition, putting it up and so on. He is very competent as a designer, a little bit lazy--but other that that he tries to get other people to do his work for him if he can, just as Sinet passes it on to him he tries to pass it on to others. Where money is concerned he is not terribly scrupulous but he's not money hungry. His weakness is women. Very much so. He shocked the Anderssons. He used to come to Lausanne and he had so many girls


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

to meet(?)
they couldn't keep up (with it).

(Did Sinet bring him to *Revolution*),

Yes. He was delegated to do the work of the English edition. Sinet couldn't do it and this was before the *French edition* was started in France, so it was Strelkoff who did it. He came to Lausanne for a couple of days to do the layout and so on. Then he found someone in Lausanne, then major a Swiss graphic artist, *commercial artist*, who did the *main* part of the work. Strelkoff came to oversee it.

That's about all there is about him. It's not very much, really.

He's not very *active* politically. His life centers around females, jazz, night clubs. He would get drunk occasionally. He shares Sinet's tastes there - and women.

Now after Chen, Grewgil and Sinet and Strelkoff, you have really reached the end of the *editorial staff* as such. There was an editorial board which was a fiction. It had names of people like Babu on it. Babu saw Verges actually twice. He never contributed anything to the magazine except one interview which I did with him, in Geneva, when he was at the UN Conference and office on Trade Development.

((Babu's biographic details are well enough known but how did he come to get involved in Revolution in the first place.))

He was suggested by Denis Pombera, Denis-Pombere is now the delegate from Tanzania to the UN. Pombera is spelled with an h. Phombesht.

Denis Phombeah is a former student - he's a Tanzanian diplomat now.

He is Tanganyikan by birth. He was the secretary of the Committee of African Organizations here in London for a number of years. This was a Ghana-subsidized attempt to group together and unify all of the various African national groups. He's married to a girl by the name of Ilona Bidieva. She is a Jewish girl from London. Her parents also former leftists. But she is very much anti-Communist. Dennis has very close ties with the British Communist party. He was a member of their African student committee.

They had a committee headed by a woman named Kay Beauchamp (Beecham) who was delegated to sort of watch over the African students and they didn't have very much success. But Dennis was able to milk them, the Ghana Government, by getting a subsidy, plus he had direct ties with the Soviets. He was a graduate student at Moscow University under Professor Ivan Potekhin (n.n.?) Potekhin. He is now dead, as you know, he was the head of their African studies department. He was getting his doctorate. I think it was in anthropology, I don't know exactly. But he was one of the very few persons


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 171

getting a doctorate in Moscow while sitting in London, and his wife spent most of her time writinghis thesis. He would tell her, "now read this book and tell me what it says" and then "work this into my general thing".

He had very little time. He also had some connections with the Chinese and had been to Peking, when I don't know, and had been invited to go to Peking lastsummer. He managed to keep from getting there. I suppose he felt that if he went he did go to Moscow on several occasions, theoretically it was to see Prof. Potenkin That was just before Datenretts death.

The Zanzibar revolution is a year old, so it was before the Kanzibar Revolution at was early last year, must-have-been-xxxxxxk. I saw him last at Orly Airport when he wast- - -

He came through I guess soverl-veeke-later on his way to Moscow. He took the Air France flight and he had an hour to kill in Paris, and I went out to the airport and saw him. He gave mexxnsxpictures photos of Zanzibar.

Yes. They told me. This was for the magazine. Some of the photos that later appeared were the photos he brought. They were all one could get.

Then he took the Air France flight to Warsaw and Moscow. When he cane back of course, although he was Tanganyikan, Babu knew him and had strong confidence in him and apponted him adviser to the Zanzibar High Com- mission here in London. The Commissioner, who had been one of the Sultan's men, had left. There had been a Civil Seruant by the name of Omar, Omar Zoran, who remained. He said he didn't want to lost his pension, revolution or no revolution. He didn't know much about revolutions. In fact, he vas very touching, because he asked us could we suggest books that he could read about revolutions. He was a tine server. While he was quite useful as the First Secretary, nevertheless Babu couldn't trust his.t

So Dennis, was put in as a sort of watchdog.

When the Geneva Conference came up, Dennis was there xxxthaxawaz dakugxinx as Bake.kaxxi, the chief de gate, from Zanzibar. In fact, he had everybody sexdałagatex sitting in as delegates, I sat in as a delegate from Zanzibar for a few minutes without even knowing it till to go out. Somebody came up and took my photograph. I assumed that I was either being photographed by the CIA or by the State Department or the Soviet side or both.

No. I assume it was for consumption. There was an East German


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 172

for press purposes. He wanted to take portraits of all the Africans. He got their names. He had a tremendous file there. (laughing) And he also had a wirephoto machine which worked right out of his studio. He did Phombeah and another fellow while I was there.

Anyway, Phombeah was known to Verges. He may have met him when Verges was in the *IUS*, International Union of Students, in Prague. He was the VicePresident. There are four vice presidents. Verges was one of them.

As I said, when we were in Algeria, we had this woman Roslind Ainslie as our correspondent here. When there came the blow-up- there was Phombeah- he knew Rosalind Ainslie and was giving her political advice. In other words, he was muchhigher up in the hierarchy of the British Communist Party, although theoretically he is not a member of the party. That I don't know. But she certainly accepted what he said to a great extent. But he was gong with overyone. So whenshe ceased to workfor us he agreed to work, for £50 a month, but not to have his naned used. He didn't want his name to appear in the magazine. He said "however, I'm certain that Babu this was before the revolution I'm certain that Babu will be willing." He sent a cable to him and got a reply which was favorable. Babu then turned up in Paris and London. He was at the Labor Party congress at Scarborough. On his way back to Africa from that congress he stopped in Paris and that was his meeting with Verges.

He told Verges then: he said "ve will be in pover within six to eight weeks after independence" And of course he was. And really that shocked Verges, Varges to see somebody who really knew what he would do. Also Babu- - very strange in that he doesn't dress well at all. He looks very sloppy.

I saw him next at the UN conference, the Geneva Conference. He came to Paris with the Omar character who was is still here. I saw he was presented to the Queen not too long ago. And his so-called Chef de Protocol, who just happened to be a boy who could speak French which was a convenience. He also came with an Italian girl by the name of Betti, her last name, and I suspect, although I an not certain, that she is Laura Betti, who is a well-known Italian actress and the alleged mistress of Pierre Paolo Passaly the film director, He vas the man who made Accatonia and just made the Gospel According to St. Matthew which got a big prize and all that. He is a homosexual and so it is a very strange sort of relationship. She was supposed to be a member of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 173

Nenni Socialists. I don't know if she has gone with the PSIUP, people the new left split, or not. I tried to get more information about her in Rome but I couldn't just walk in and say "veren't you the girl I found in bed with Babu". She speaks English well and she spent a considerable amount of time in Geneva with him and came to Paris with him.
He was also with Murray Sales (phon) an Australian who spent most of his time as a mutual funds salesman. Murray was based in Geneva. I suspect that he also was supplying girls.

Murry was also in contact with and introduced Babu to a man by the name of Victor Herbert, who is an American Mutual Funds salesman. He used to be with OIS, Overseas Investment Service, in Geneva, which is the biggest American overseas fund, run by a man by the name of Bernie Kante Cornbelt(?). Exactly what this curious crowd was do'ng with Babu there in Genova I don't know. Murray Sales then later told stories which were not quite true of a man who was going around the Hotel Intercontinental in Geneva knocking on doors saying that "are you a Foreign Minister?" "Yes" Well, I want to invest $50,000 in your country. Which country do you come from." Now Murray Felt's story is different. He told Encounter that someone came and said, "I'm from the CIA. Here's a gold watch and I'll give you $50,000 if you'll work for us." (Who are you) Yes, who are you?

Despite some of the curious antics I heard of with Cubans, I can't believe anybody would get that way. And besides, Babu was very amused by the man who did come. And he didn't get a watch. He told me that he'd gotten a camera from the West Germans once. They said "don't recognize Ubricht and we'll give you this lovely camera." Of course they had already made a deal with East Germany.

(What was Victor Herbert's rolein all this?)

I suspect that they were trying to invest money, that was all.

The thing which interests me about all of this is that Babu, despite the fact he is a revolutionary, and a very competent one, I think, he has other scheming to his fow.

One, he is very much interested in women. Two, he drinks heavily.

Money, which is extremely scarce in Zanzibar like most places in the world, is of great interest to him. He also told us that he had informed the Chinese that he was going to carry out the coup and the Chinese were opposed to it. They went ahead anyway. They thought it was an adventure.

Then afterwards since you were able to do it (is that what he told you?)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 174

Yes, that's what he told Vergest and me. *Actually, that wasn't for publication*. Phombeah brought in Babu. Babu had no real connection with the magazine except on these two occasions. He gave me an interview which was printed in the last issue - in both issues of Revolution, and that was all. Then he went off to Indonesia. That's history. The merger has being made between Tanganyika and Zanzibar and it was *partly* partially behind his back although he knew that it was going to go on and he was not at all opposed. He felt that it was a good thing. We found it difficult to understand why he felt it was a good thing, but he thought that in Tanganyßika the chaos was so great and the lack of defined goals, the lack of ability- the capacity to satisfy the *growing* needs of the masses community. there would be such that the Indians which had its hand on the *small* floor business and also the *big-time* fibre plantations and [Julius] what-not were an especially vulnerable target group, that/Nyerere, despite all of his humanism and his Catholic religion wouldn't be able to put up much resistance. I think he was quite right. That's what happened. That is, Zanzibar which is taking over Tanganyiké into Tanzania. There was a struggle between Babu and Handa, but that seemed to calm down to a great extent. I think that's over now. I've heard different things. I don't know.

One of the things that this fellow Curtis Cabe of the Atlantic monthly proposed to do - he has more proposals than he has dollars- unfortunately, is that we try to go to Zanzibar. No one has even done any (reporting) *really of any particular note*. I probably could get in. No one/has written anything about Zanzibar, since the revolution. Don't know whether that is possible or not. (There was a great deal of noise at the time of the revolution about Babu's relationship with Kao Liang, the NENA man.)

Well, yes, it's true he has worked for them. And after he informed them of what he was going to do, they that was about two or three days before the revolution. They had given him a small amount of money, but not much. it wasn't their money - the Zanzibar revolution, *it was extremely confusing*, because he was out of the country at the time. Heknew what must be done. But for instance, the bringing in of- the fellow- Okello which was an incredible thing to do. the former police corporal from Uganda. I have the feeling that he was by no means all powerful, that it was a coalition of forces, the revolution was popular in the sense that the overwhelming majority of the island's population was represented among the revolutionaries who turned against the Arab and Indian population.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

which had long had a standing grudge against that and saw no way of doing away with, but obviously they weren't all as left as Babu.

Osman made
You had for instance Othman Sharif, who may be Ambassador to United States. be main son was made Ambassador in vile then to keep him out of Tanganyika. He was going to be here in London, I think he was the High Commissioner in London, for a very short period of time. And then when the merger came, it was the Tanganyikan High Commissioner who represented the merged countries, with Omar Zoran still staying on as the Secretary, Dennis Phombeah. Phombeah going to the UN where he had been in Geneva at one point now in New York, Sharif going to Washington

((And was recently recalled),

Yes. Sharif's position is extremely shaky, but they really disliked him greatly, but because he is the head of the Suisaia Community they couldn't strike him down right away. What they wanted to do really was to put him in a position where he would finally be bought out. They figured that he would go over to the Western side. One day or the other he would jump. And that's the way of getting rid of him- without them having to do anything. That's one reason he was sent to Washington. They thought that after a while he would. .

((So much for Babu. Now onthe Board))

Now we have the Mulana Bashani- - he is a Pakistani. Dennis Rhombeah was unable to continue his work. He was unable really to do anything. He was just collecting £60 a month. The reason that he did absolutely nothing was that the actual work was done by a Pakistani named Hansa Alavi

Hansa Alavi a former secretary, Third Secretary or something, of the Pakistan National Bank. He is a Marxist, doubt that he is actually a member of the Pakistan Communist party. He comes from the Ismaeli Sect. Moslem Sects, and his family is extremely wealthy and has holdings in Tanganyikaya fibre plantation. He also has relatives in Zanzibar. When he was asked by Dennis Phombeah to go to Zanzibar to help straighten out their balance of payments problems, which he wanted to do, his family told him that if he did he'd never come back to them, since they had lost some money, He is a great friends of Ralph Milleband of London School of Economic here. He is an academic. He has contacts with Trotskyist groups. His contacts with the British Communist party are not very good. He is very easy going, a rather soft personality. He is by no means 100% or even 50% pro-Chinese. In particular because he doesn't approve of Chinese support for President Ayub Khan. This led to his replacement finally.

Verges wanted somebody from Pakistan on the board. (شعله) He/said "I'm certain that the Mulana Bashani Kahn will agree".

((That would be Mulana Abdul Hamid Bashani))

That's right. He's sometimes called Kahn as a title of respect.

He's a 70 or 80 years old man. He's called the Red Mullah, sort of like the Red Dean of Canterbury.

He's the leader of one of the East Pakistan parties. He had been to China and was quite pro-Chinese. He was more than willing. But he had absolutely no contact whatever with the magazine.

((Did he come in to replace Hamba Alavi))

Yes.

((How long did Hansa Alavi work with the magazine))

You would have to check the issues of the English edition. He was there until slightly before we dropped Rosalind Ainslie. That would be

May of 63. right up to spring of 64.

((Did Hansa Alavi do anything actually)) or did he just found

He got manuscripts and so on. He actually did the work that Phombeah never did. But that was all. And it was sort of *contra coeur* with him because he did not agree with the thing. He had the idea that the magazine was *axecutest* open forum, *rostrum* for the debate between an sort of all sorts of revolutionary movements. But when it became very obvious that Verges wanted to try, at that time, at least, to stay with the Chinese line, it particularly because of his feelings about the situation in Pakistan and he wasn't happy. Also on the question of India, he felt that the Chinese position vis-a-vis India wasn't just, and he didn't like the hook-upt between Pakistani the friendship and actual solidarity between Pakistan and China.

(So he was through amicably. What is the present relationship between Alavi and Verges))

I doubt if he has any at all. He is very active here in London with Pakistani groups. he has money. His wife"s family has money, his own family has. It wasn't a question of money for him.

((Has he continued to be active in AfreeAsian things))

He's an academic. The Socialist Register published last year by an article on Imperialism by him. He is active around the London School of Economics. He is known to the academic Left, friends with the boys who do Left Review and so on. His only practical work would be working with Pakistani groups for instance during the last election


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 179

the Tories ran in several constituencies Pakistani independent candidates
in the hope of breaking the Labor vote, hoping that the Pakistanis would
vote for these Pakistani independents. Hansa worked with the Labor Party
in those constituencies, to counter this; and apparently they were quite
successful. He has very good connections inside the Labor Party. And
he does not have very good ties at all with the Communist Party, though
he is not by any means anti-Communist. He's a skeptic.

(How about Bashani)

He has never done anything. Never heard from him except once when he
said we could put his name on the board. As far as I know there has
never been any contact.

(Do they get paid for this)

No.
Next is Hassan Riad. He is E. Amir. He is an official of the UN
(with headquarters in Dakar
Economic Commission for Africa, UN economic adviser in Dakar, He has a
very high position inthat. He is Egyptian, a full member of the Egyptian
Communist Party with very very pronounced Trotskyist views. That is, he
feels, he has a theory about the role of bureaucracy in under-developed
countries - the progressive and reactionary bureaucracy- fits into
general Trotskyist theories but applied there. He has done work on
Egypt, state capitalism in Egypt. A book of his published recently by
Edicion de Minuit in Paris, part of which appeared in Revolution. Some
of it was so obviously Trotskyist that Chen, despite his somewhat partial
agreement with parts of it felt that it was too obvious even to print
in Revolution. He only comes through Paris occasionaly. His main interest
in REvolution is getting his things printed. He is very interested in
having his things published. He is very cynical about many of the African
States. His article on Senegal appeared recently in Revolution, in French,
I think in No. 12. It was written under a pseudonym by him and based on
the UN Economic Commission for Africa research , stuff that he couldn't
say in his official capacity. (Pseudonym) Like Jalet, yes.

He is not overly pro-Chinese. He feels that the Chinese philosophical
position isn't quite adequate, the ideological model isn't
adequate for under undeveloped countries, certainly for Africa .

((Do you know him- How old is he))

Yes I know him. He is in his thirties. About 35. Married. He is Egyptian.

He is anti-Nasser really. He feels that the Egyptian Communist Party
really abdicated any constructive role inside Egypt, even from the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 180

concentration camps where they were held putting out secret clandestine tracts supporting Nasser, which was the craziest thing I've ever heard. Because how they've been liberated in fact the old Communists are now being given very high organizational posts in the new Egyptian Party, and Communism and Marxism is extraneous to Arab socialism but they are very careful people so they use them in there. And the group that are under Soviet influence are perfectly willing to go along with thisf',

((Is he pro-anything in Egypt))

No, I think that he is sort of resigned to the events of history. He analyzes what he considers state capitalist developments, the rise of a new bureaucratic middle class, the officer class and he tries to show in his writings how the officer class has crushed the old land-owning Vafdist ruling class which had its links with British and French financial interests, and has now consolidated itself in power and there is a certain social mobility, but for them only. In other words, how limited it is and the officer caste certain of its functionaries but still the problem of the masses remains.

((Does he concern himself very much with the state of Egypt?))

From an academic point of view only. He's more academic. He's not even particularly concerned with revolution. If you want his address...

Now who do we have- Marcos Ferrer- That's Colombia. I don't know anything about it. It probably stands for Dr. Leiva Semper of the MONC in Paris. He is a Colombian doctor, the representative in Paris of the MOAC. He is the one who conducted negotiations with Verges for a Spanish edition in Colombia. I assume Marcos Ferrer to be a pseudonym.

Exaddy, Ginvalla, next on the list, is a member of the Indin Congress for South Africa. She was a correspondent of *Revolution* in Dar es Salaam and she published a magazine called *Spearhead* until she was expelled from Tanganyika under a cloud and accused of being a Western spy. The accusations were not made openly. She was known to have contacts with the Western West German Embassy. She received West German money from the Carl Ebert Foundation and actually printed West German propaganda in the her magazine. She had gone to West Germany and done this so obviously that she couldn't have been very sophisticated about it because it was just too (open). She was accused, of having told the Soviet Embassy of having offered to carry information for the Soviet Embassy, volunteering as a Communist, a South African Communist, to give then information, two-thirds of which turned out to be totally useless and false, which again might have been to ingratiate herself. The works She was here in London after she was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 181

expelled, I'm not certain of the exact dates. She was also known to have slept around with almost every minister of the Tanganyikan government including Julius Nyerere. This is one of the reasons why there was so much hushhush about her, that she had obviously gotten a lot of information out of these fellows. She was very close to Oscar Kambona and she claimed that Oscar Kambona was going to get her back into the Foreign Ministry.

She was just Revolution's correspondent there. She did practically nothing. When she got out, she managed to keep her little office going. They didn't seize anything, and she turned over themailing list of her Spearhead magazine to Revolution. Verges had paid her £1000 deposit so she could do some work but she really didn't do anything, but she unlike Rosalind Ainslie, turned over the unspent portion of that to Verges when she came to London.and she wasn't interested really in continuing her work with Revolution. Being Indian of course posed a problem with for her with anything to do with the Chinese. She was very close to the Indian community, as anyone who looks through that mailing list will see we have lots of missionary Indian business, and so forth in East Africa, who were taking subscriptions to the magazine more or less out of friendship and solidarity with another Indian. They didn't caremuch whether she was a Communist or not.

She was supposed to have been the mistress of Dr. Dadu. At least they say she slept with Dr. Dadu and they had a very close relationship to him. Dr. Dadu is the president of the Indian Congress for South Africa and a member of the Communist Party of South Africa, a very important member. Because the Indian community has holdings up and down East Africa, Mozambique as well, their role in the liberation struggle is very equivocal .

Obviously the Africans want to go ahead while the Indians are think一ing - well-Africanization meant to the Indians The English used then as a sort of buffer, preferred to bring an Indian clerk to East Africa rather than to train an African. That was a typical colonial maneuver but now it has put the Indians in a situation historically which is untenable, for a long period. You know people talk about multi-racial states but in East Africa it is a joke. It won't hold up. I don't think it will, anyway.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 182

# The Indian Congress of South Africa is related to the African National Congress, the Solored people's congress, all of this in a so-called Congress Alliance. She had contacts with the Africand- the ANR people.

The ANC people here in London. They were suspicious of her, as well.

But she managed somehow to get back in, she was ill, she was in hospital. She was hurtin an auto accident, and she had to have a very complicated bone operation. That put her out of action for some time.

I don't know, but I heard that she is now back in Tanganyika.

She may well be. She has quite a bit of money; Her family has money.

Of course the Indians do have money. She did very little for the magazine.

She occasionally told me about people in the ANC who might do something for the magazine. But most of the people she told me abut were members of the South African Communist Party. That party has taken a pro-Moscow stand and most of its people don't want to do anything for Revolution, though we did have articles by Bryan Bunk another South African Communist.

That was before their party took their stand on the Sino-Soviet conflict.

And there is a struggle going on right now inside of the ANC.

That's a long complicated thing. That has nothing to do with Revolutin.

(On my list here we have Diallo))

Diallo is an adviser of the President of Mali- vhat's his name:

Modeva Keida.

Married to a French woman, is Leftist, he knows Verges through friendship and offered to help. He put him in contact with

who is Minister of Information, who is very, very pro-Chinese.

((In Mali)

Yes. When Chou en Lai visited Mali, you recall that he got quite committed.

There were some gratuitous, open handed slaps.

There's nothing very much. He just knew him.

This is again one-of-Verges-attempts to have a finger in another African country

I didn't mention, with Phongbeah, one of the reasons that he kept phonbeah was phombeah's connection with Odinga, in Kenya.

Phombeah at one time had hoped to be made the secretary of this new Lumumba Institute there, in Nairobi. Verges, odd as it may seem, had at one time, proposed himself as a sort of security adviser to Odinga.

We felt that he continued to pay Dennis Phombeah for doing nothing mainly to keep a line of communication open to Odinga. He had met Odinga but got nowhere with him. In Algiers he was friend Le Chinois


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 183

# President of Mali,

Moba Keita. Married to a French woman. Leftist. He knows Verges through friendship and offered to help. He put him in contact with a man by the name of Mogotogo (!), who is Minister of Information, who is very very pro-Chinesey in Mali.

And when Chou en Lai visited Mali you recall that he got quite a committed welcome in Mali. And there were some gratuitous open-handed slaps the Russians made. Didn't have to be made but were.

((How did Verges and Diallo get together))

I don't know. He had known him for a considerable time. There is nothing very much. This is again one of Verges's attempts to have a finger in another African country. One of the reasons that he kept Phombeah was Phombeah's connection with Odinga.

If in Algiers he was referred to as Le Chinois I don't think the Kenyans would accept him.

This is a real problem. He says, "well, we colored people and so forth" and it is true that he is part - he's Eurasian, but it is very hard for Africans to accept that. They just put him down as Chinese.

I don't know very much about Demba Diallo. He played very little role in the Magazine except that he was a contact inside of Mali . He came to France early last year, the spring of last year, with his wife. He went to Vichy for his health and drank the waters for two or three weeks and he saw Verges. Verges had ideas, had mentioned to Ken that if he couldn't keep the magazine going he might go to Mali. Ken was going to be sent off to wherever, Viriato da Cruz of the Angolan Federation of Liberation, as adviser, and I was going to be sent to Indonesia for the Afro-Asian Journalists. That was how he was going to take care of everybody.

(How about Castro Da Silva)

Castro Da Silva is the pseudonym used for Viriato da Cruz, formerly of the MPLA, and now of the UPA. He is a poet, again, late thirties, married, has a child and is based more or less in Algiers. He has virtually no money at all. He has a small group which went into the UPA.

Holden Roberto, the head of the UPA is very suspicious of him, but nevertheless he needs him. He needs the Left. He has been to China and this give him a sort of gives the Chinese a guarantee, but on the other hand the Chinese didn't even want to give Viriato money to transfer


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

himself from Algiers to Brazzaville. And he was threatened by the MPLA
people, who are of course Sovie-backed to the hilt, in fact more.

Dr. Neto, *apparently* more than ever now. And the Algerians, Ben Bella,
who had supported the MPLA up until the great fiasco when people discovered
that they didn't have what they claimed to have given their support to the UPA. Nevertheless, the MPLA people still
remain and they are promising to reform and really carry out things
ideologically.
I think that *logically* the MPLA is much more congenial to the Algerians
and to all of the hard revolutionary line, people.

Holden Roberto is considered to be an American agent pure and simple
and always has been. In actual fact, he received a lot of money through
various Protestant missionary groups, American Protestant missionary groups.

And he himself is a Christian Protestant. These tie-ups have helped the
Rightists to back him. He did go off to China, made some *talents*.

The Chinese haven't made any real decisive choice between the MPLA and the
UPA. They're just waiting to see who is going to be able to produce.

((What about da Cruz): What is his function)

He has no function except to write articles about Angola, which he
has done, one of which he signed with his own name. He has very little
money and he hoped that Verges would be able to smooth the way with the
Chinese, but alas! poor fellow, he learnt to his horror, I understand, that Verges
was by no means the Chinese agent that he presumed him to be. I understand
that he has virtually retired from politics . He is a poet. And he'd much
rather be a poet than anything else. He told me on several occasions that really
in Paris when he came to my house there for dinner that he wished he could
get out of the whole thing, what was he going to do, he didn't have a
passport, he had all these people sort of pushing him in
into this. He didn't have any money. He didn't know what to do.

((He lives in Paris))

No, he lives in Algiers. He is still in Algiers to best of my knowledge,
He is one of the people in Algiers I would see. If I were to go to
Algiers I would look him up. He's not terribly dynamic but
events threw him up into a leading position and he sort of stuck
there and doesn't know how to get out. The Chinese Haven't given him
the all out support that he had hoped for

((Neither have they turned him down))

No.

# (Amilcar Cabrera)

That was a name used, not a pseudonym, a false name. It doesn't represent anyone, it represents the FALN, of Venezuela in Europe. They have a bureau in France. I didn't really know them. I knew there were several people. One of them a graphic artist, whose drawings were printed in *Revolution*. They brought the things to him. They are authentic.

Because when Verges had a young French boy traveling through Latin America he went to Venezuela. They got him into the guerillas. They got him all around. We had some very authentic *short-hand* reports. So whoever they are they are authentic. They were very, very cautious, probably suspicious of me because I was an American, so I never had any real conversation with them.

(Do you know anything about who Verges's link to them was)

(Do you know if he still has them)

I know this, they asked him to remove the name Amilcar Cabrera and it has been removed, because it was identified with them. So he then put in a note in the twelfth French edition that in the future he would receive an article from the information department of the FALN. They'd be foolish not to send material, but they didn't want to be identified with the editorial policy of the magazine. This many reflect various tendencies inside of the FALN which I have read about. I don't know anything, first-hand that they split between a hard line, those who want to continue the real struggle and the sabotage struggle and those who want to look for possible negotiated solutions, one group that is a little more pro-Chinese.

In any case these people did represent the FALN, there is no doubt about it. I didn't know any of them. They never had any dealings with me.

(Patricia Magowan)

I know very little about her. She did this book on Portugal. She was connected with the British Communist Party but also with Trotskyists. She was the one who found Rosalind Ainslee to work here in London for the magazine. She is the mistress of a man named Carlos

((Lanca?))

I'm not certain. That might be it. He is a European born in Mozambique, a Portuguese, who has been kept going by various African movements for years because he represents (laughing) what the French call an interlocateur, when they want to call him out


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 186

He represents nothing. He's a sort of hopeless person. She's a very dynamic woman. Verges claimed that she had become a police informer, for the Algerian police, and that she talked to very opposite groups and to occasionally, Skaxższked to Mamani of the Salava grimix party in Algiers. But she no longer has anything to do with Revolution Africaine. I don't know what she is going. She wouldn't have anything to do with Verges after the moment that she refused to go to Lausanne. You see, be nas

((Why))

Why did she refuse to go? Well, she couldn't leave Carlos by himself. God knows what would happen to him. Secondly, she hadoto wanted to be all-the-time in Algiers. She wasnt inerente interested in running a magazine in Switzerland, the magazineinterest was secondary to her.

There was another Portuguese-speaking person in Algiers. That was a man by the name of Aqueno Braganza. Braganza is a Goan a/Goan who has lost hig reason for being with the end of the Portuguese colonial rule in Coa, he should have gone back! But wh he had been a Goan revolutionary had, with the Portuguese opposition.for years he has been in Rabat hooked up to the, at that time it was the CONCP, Conference 2162 Nationaliste des Colonies Portuguese, which grouped together the Eileso what later, came to be the Falimo and the MPLA. It was part of the hard line countries

There was another one elsewhere which was soft line. Braganza was also sort of adviser to the magazine, Revolution Africaine ad questions of India and so on. He stayed on and worked with Mohammed Harbi and came to London.

2((Did he have anything to do with Patticia Macgowan)

Yes. They had been together in Rabat.

((Did he have anything to do with Carlos))

Yes. It's all the same crowd. But Carlos was waiting for destiny to call him and Braganza had already lost his chance. The Indians had got ins They'd liberated Goa, so what next, you know.Go back to India. He obviously wasn't going to go back .He was living too well, as it was. insaluwar 21. grein is 10 And in Goa, nobody knew him in Goa. He was a Goan educated in Portugal. One of these people really without a real national identity. He knew that he wasn't Portuguese and had this feeling of alienation from Portugal, which made hin like most for the colonials students there-- the MPLA really started in Portugal- made hin an oppositionist. He didn't have enoughy roots with the homeland. So he's just sort for floating around. His wife is a school teacher. He speaks excellent French. He was working for Revolution Africaine. I don't know if he still is. I'a certain he'll find something to do. He'll never go back to Goa.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 187

((This points up the need for a continuing revolution, when the revolution is completed))

Yes. You don't have jobs unless you're in the government. And that's a problem, too. In his case, he, wasn't even a real revolutionary, just a bureaucrat in Rabat and other places.

((How did Macgowan get involved with Verges))

That I don't know. I don't know how he got her in the beginning, in Rabat. He used to go to Morocco quite often and had contact with all the African, the-race people there. I suspect that's were he met her.

((How much those guys))

Now you've got Harbi. He was the person who replaced Verges. He's out now, but I'm told by Andersson, who has his ear to the ground in Algiers as well as in Switzerland, that Harbi is in a very good position. He is one of the leading advisers to Ben Bella, represents the Left position. He's a Trotskyist, or a Trotskyist sympathiser without any formal organizational ties. He is very close to the Pablo.

That's Michel. He's Pablo, we could'nt have overlooked him, he's a feature of Algiers life. He played an extremely importat role in the agrarian reform, in, the type of agrarian reform that was gong to be carried out. He came down on the Yugoslav model, that is collectives which are privately owned by the collectives and run on profit model, that is on a profitbasis.

Harbi were all inside of this Bureau des Biens Vacants then which/became the Bureau of the Socialist Sector. I once did an article for *Monthly Review*, so I know all about how it operated. What really happened was that the Europeans fled just before/just after Independence, rather should have, considering what they had done. But they expected a blood bath. The blood bath never took place. It was an incredible.

That was one of the most incredible things to me in Algeria was that the Algerians didn't -

Because the stories were horrifying. You know what happened. A month or so before, they were just shooting everybody on the street, trying to provoke them, and the discipline of the FLN vas incredible. Nobody would shoot back, no matter what they did. So they fled and they left all these farms. It was a question of ploughing and seeding. There is only a certain time of year that you have to do this. This had to be organized and it was organized almost spontaneously locally. And then-

This was sort of institutionalized later, after it was an accomplished fact. They want some sort of a socialist.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 188

didn't know how and the institutionalizing of it was really directed by
these Trotskyists. There was Pablo, Harbi, a French lawyer named Matthieu
from Grenoble who had been involved with the FLN, and he, became sort of
legal adviser of *Biens Vacants*, which was vaguely under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Agriculture which was at that time under Omar Usgan
who is now Minister of State, and Director of Revolution Africaine at
present. He replaced Harbi.

Harbi is deeply resented by the army elements which are pro-Egyptian.
However, the Army, despite its religious inclination had
its socialist bias and would like to see more centralization, more on an
Egyptian model. In other words, they would like to see much more control
from the center than this confused type of regional or local control.
They feel that in the long run the business of the private collective
ownership is going to cause trouble. It's all right if it is a rich
one, but what happens if it is a poor one? You don't split a profit, you
split a deficit. Obviously, according to the Yugoslav model, the State
intervenes. The State taxes the rich ones and then distributes subsidies
to the poor ones, but this a debate that is still going on in Algeria, and
curiously enough these Trotskyists have been in contact, very close contact
with the Yugoslavs. As you recall, the campaign, the so-called campagne
de labeur, the ploughing, was made possible only by the delivery of 563
Yugoslav tractors which turned out to the great deception of some of the
Algerians not to be Yugoslav but to be American tractors put together
in Yugoslavia under license.

((This is getting us a little bit far afield))

This is Harbi and this is the group. Harbi represents the leading
spokesmen of this sort of Trotskyist-leaning Left group, and his post is
still very high, even though he is no longer Director.

((When was he dropped))

I think last summer. I'm not certain. With Usgan it has become much
more the word Socialism appears in Arabic because it
is felt that Socialism in French doesn't have the same meaning as it has
in Arabic. It's very silly, represents the very muddled mind
that Usgan has. He is very much split between his religious inclinations,
and Usgan is a full member of the Communist party of Algeria but
he left formationalist reasons when they refused to support the rebellion, and
joined the FLN. His wife is supposed to be fanatically religious and has
made him more religious than he was.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 189

((Curious mix-up - this religion and politics.))

(Returning to our first subject, Strelkoff. Is he a practicing Jew?))

No.

(Just an ethnic Jew)

Yes.

((Next on the list here is Robert Williams, Whoever made this up calls him an American in Peking.))

He's in Havana. He was in Peking recently and he may still be there, for that matter. He went on a second trip to the Far East, was in one of the countries that had a celebration. I think he was in Hanoi, if I'm not mistaken. He was in Asia. He may still be there.

Robert Williams is a Negro, former President of the Union County North Carolina branch of the NAACP, who had a hell of a battle on his hands against the local Kuklus Klan and discovered the best way to deal with the KuKlux Klan was to shoot back at them. And it worked. They never had seen it, in that part of the south, anyway, the small towns of the South. Up until recently there's been sort of agreement in the south that the Negro civil rights groups would go into the big cities, where they would be reasonably protected. But they had to leave them. Williams rural areas alone because they couldn't expect of course, was a great embarrassment to everybody, there is no doubt,

NAACP and they were on his back. He got no sympathy from the leadership. He first came to national prominence after a case of obvious injustice where some local a white man done something to a Negro woman and jury had thrown it out He said.vell if we can't get justice in the courts we'll have to take justice in our own hands. But even the fact that older, more Negroes would fight back got the old leaders very upset. He wee-immediately, People came to his support, particularly the Trotskyites, not the Communists, came in, and tried to take him over. They did some support. There had been a case before, another case, locally called the Kissing case. Two Negro boys, you may have heard of it, were sentenced to indefinite terms in prison for having kissed a six-year-old white girl. He was involvedin that and again, it was the Trotskyites who came to his support with other liberal groups. In terms of organizational support it was the Trotskyites. I heard of him at the time I was in CBS and I thought that it was very understandable and sent him a message of support. I met him at the time of the Naacp Conference in New York in 1959 and when the FPCC was formed he was among the eight Negroes who were among the 30 founding members, to the great shock of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 190

of the Communist Party of the United States, wich did not particularly
approve of seeing the two issues mixed, Cuba and Negroes.

Williams, very volatile, a very determined person, on a local level,
has no ability whatsoever on a national level. He has become a symbol
now to Negro youth in particular, as a Negro who is not an Uncle Tom, who
will fight, We knew what was coming in the summer of 61,
perhaps it was before-- no--obviouslywas embarrassment, for the

national executive of the NAACP, embarrassment for the Justice Department,
and more than embarrassment, Terry Sanford, who was the Governor, and who
told him, "I wish you were dead. Period." Finally, by one
of these flukes of fate, there was demonstration over a swimming pool.
They didn't want to integrate the pool. They just wanted to swim in it.

But the local people said they didn't want to do that because they would
have to change the water, and it would take too much time to change the
water after Negroes swan in the water. So they had some demonstrations.

Williams was almost murdered in one of these occasions. The demostrations
were getting pretty violent. And then King sent in some Freedom Riders who
were going to show them how non-violence was going to work in this
town. They decided to make an example. So Williams said, I'm going to get
out of this. I don't want anything to do with your non-violence. But
you go ahead and I'll see what happens.

Well the non-violent demonstration became more violent There were
people shots. There were arrests. There was an English girl who now figures
here in the British Trotskyist party, who was over there. People were coming
from all over, reports in the European press. Willians now had nothing to do with this, he was just sort of staying there
saying well you see where non-violence gets you-- but there was a report
that they were going to lynch the people who had been arrested. As often
happens in this type of thing the Negroes and whites, outside whites
who were involved, really came in for a hill of a beating, and as in the
Philadelphia, Mississippi, case, they, have been killed. Williams was more
or less a victim of the mobin the Negro community which said "we've got to
do something. We've got to free these people, get them out of jail."

He had arms, including machine guns, which had been purchased in
New York and sent down there. They didn't use them because they got scared,
but they had arms. The community was armed. The people, out in the street
in front of his house, when a car with a white couple came down this road,
It was surrounded and they were told to get out. The crowd wanted to string
them up right there. This man came from a neighboring


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 191

town, claimed, had losttheir way. They said, no you're a member of the Klan in this town. They wanted to kill him or hold him as hostage.

Williams said, "bring these people in my house and you know I won't let them go." He called the Sheriff, and said, "look, I have these people here and my people are very upset and I want you to know that I don't want anything to happen to our people that you have in the jail." The Sheriff immediately called the National Guard, State Troopers and what not. They, couldn't hold out very long. Williams escaped. Julian Mayfield was there, a Negro writer who now lives in Ghana as a result of this. Minnie Mallory, a Negro woman from New York who was there, was later arrested and convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison for kidnapping. Williams was spirited across the United States-I knew vaguely where he was, but he kept very carefully by Cubans and by Negro groups in contact with the Cubans, to Canada, from Canada he was flown by private plane and-by Castro himself, to Havana, where he is now.

On two occasions the FBI came to me asking for information about Williams, and I damn sure wasn't going to give any of what I knew. We had tried to get in touch with Bobby Kennedy himself. I had sent telegrams. I even tried to get a telephone call in. Because I knew what was going to happen on this thing, to get some kind of Federal intervention. It was one of those sickening things.

They wanted him out of the way. Even they came to me later-two of the agents came to the FPCC office in New York. They said, "We have 500 agents. We'll get him. He'll never get away." Well, he was away at that point. His aunt died in New York around that time.

They went to the funeral parlor where the body was and put a wanted poster on the coffin to see if he would come. Really, they should have been thrown out on their heads, frankly. If it hadn't been Negroes I'm certain they would never have done that sort of thing. The trouble was, the trouble is the whole attitude. Anyhow, as it is, Williams is not a Communist, he's not a Trotskyite. He's a former Marine, who's just had enough. Really, you know. And now he has turned into a world-wide figure/because people like Bobby Kennedy and others could not try to see what could be done about it.. It was no use, though. I mean, it's no use now. I'm certainly and everybody."

Well, that's too bad. Just like the case of these boys, Walter Bow, and so on. And they're not the only ones. For every Walter Bow there must be at least a hundred. I must say, I would no more want to live in the States now -- you're going to really see something. I don't really


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 192

Verges wanted somebody from Pakistan on the board. He said "I'm certain that the Mulana Bashani Kahn will agree".

((That would be Mulana Abdul Hamid Bashani))

That's right. He's sometimes called Kahn as a title of respect.

He's a 70 or 80 years old man. He's called the Red Mullah, sort of like the Red Dean of Canterbury.

He's the leader of one of the East Pakistan parties. He had been to China and was quite pro-Chinese. He was more than willing. But he had absolutely no contact whatever with the magazine.

((Did he come in to replace Hamsa Alavi))

Yes.

((How long did Hamsa Alavi work with the magazine))

You would have to check the issues of the English edition. He was there until slightly before we dropped Rosalind Ainslie. That would be May of 63. right up to spring of 64.

((Did Hamsa Alavi do anything actually)) or did he just found

He got manuscripts and so on. He actually did the work that Phombeah never did. But that was all. And it was sort of *contre coeur* with him because he did not agree with the thing. He had the idea that the magazine was an open forum, rostrum for the debate between all sorts of revolutionary movements. But when it became very obvious that Verges wanted to try, at that time, at least, to stay with the Chinese line, it particularly because of feelings about the situation in Pakistan and he wasn't happy. Also on the question of India, he felt that the Chinese position vis-a-vis India wasn't just, and he didn't like the hook-upt between Pakistani the willing friendship and actual solidarity between Pakistan and China.

((So he was through amicably. What is the present relationship betweenAlavi and Verges))

I doubt if he has any at all. He is very active here in London with Pakistani groups. He has money. His wife"s family has money, his own family has. It wasn't a question of money for him.

((Has he continued to be active in AfroAsian things))

He's an academic. The Socialist Register published last year by an article on Imperialism by him. He is active around the London School of Economics. He is known to the academic Left, friends with the boys who do Left Review and so on. His only practical work would be working with Pakistani groups, for instance during the last election


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 193

the Tories ran in several constituencies Pakistani independent candidates
in the hope of breaking the Labor vote, hoping that the Pakistanis would
vote for these Pakistani independents. Hansa worked with the Labor Party
in those constituencies, to counter this; and apparently they were quite
successful. He has very good connections inside the Labor Party. And
he does not have very good ties at all with the Communist Party, though
he is not by any means anti-Communist. He's a skeptic.

(How about Bashani)

He has never done anything. Never heard from him except once when he
said we could put his name on the board. As far as I know there has
never been any contact.

(Do they get paid for this)

No.

Next is Hassan. He is Amir. He is an official of the UN
(with headquarters in Dakar)
Economic Commission for Africa, UN economic adviser in Dakar. He has a
very high position inthat. He is Egyptian, a full member of the Egyptian
Communist Party with very very pronounced Trotskyist views. That is, he
feels, he has a theory about the role of bureaucracy in under-developed
countries - the progressive and reactionary bureaucracy- fits into
general Trotskyist theories but applied there. He has done work on
Egypt, state capitalism in Egypt. A book of his published recently by
Edicion de Minuit in Paris, part of which appeared in Revolution. Some
of it was so obviously Trotskyist that, despite his somewhat partial
agreement with parts of it felt that it was too obvious even to print
in Revolution. He only comes through Paris occasionaly. His main interest
in REvolution is getting his things printed. He is very interested in
having his things published. He is very cynical about many of the African
States. His article on Senegal appeared recently in Revolution, in French,
I think in No. 12. It was written under a pseudonym and based on
the UN Economic Commission for Africa research , stuff that he couldn't
say in his official capacity. (Pseudonym) Lajalle, yes.

He is not overly pro-Chinese. He feels that the Chinese philosophical
position isn't quite adequate, the ideological model isn't
adequate for under undeveloped countries, certainly for Africa .

((Do you know him- How old is he))

Yes I know him. He is in his thirties. About 35. Married. He is Egyptian.
He is anti-Nasser really. He feels that the Egyptian Communist Party has
really abdicated any constructive role inside Egypt, even from the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 194

concentration camps where they were held putting out secret clandestine
tracts supporting Nasser, which was the craziest thing I've ever heard.
Because how they've been liberated - in fact the old Communists are now
being given very high organizational posts in the new Egyptian Party, and
Communism and Marxism is extraneous to Arab socialism but they very useful people to use there. And the group that are under
Soviet influence are perfectly willing to go along with thist'.

((Is he pro-anything in Egypt))

No, I think that he is sort of resigned to the events of history. He
analyzes what he considers state capitalist developments, the rise of a new
bureaucratic middle class, the officer class and he tries to show in his
writings how the officer class has crushed the old land-owning Wafdist
ruling class which had its links with British and French financial
interests, and has now consolidated itself in power, and there is a certain
social mobility, but for them only. In other words, how limited it is and
the officer caste certain of its functionaries but still the
problem of the masses remains.

(does he concern himself very much with the state of Egypt?)

From an academic point of view only. He's more academic. He's not even
particularly concerned with revolution. If you want his address...

Now who do we have- Marcos Ferrer-That's Colombia. I don't know
anything about it. It probably stands for Dr. Leiva Semper of the MOAC
IN Paris. He is a Colombian doctor, the representative in Paris of the
MOAC. He is the one who conducted negotiations with Verges for a Spanish
edition in Colombia. I assume Marcos Ferrer to be a pseudonym.
Frene Ginwalla, next on the list, is a member of the India Congress
for South Africa, She was a correspondent of *Revolution in Dar es Salaam*
and she published a magazine called *Spearhead* until she was expelled from
*Tanganyika* under a cloud and accused of being a Western spy. The accusations
were not made openly. She was known to have contacts with the Western
West German Embassy. She received West German money from the Carl Ebert
Foundation and actually printed West German propaganda in the her magazine.
She had gone to West Germany and done this so obviously that she couldn't have been very sophisticated about it because it was just too
(open). She was accused, of having told the Soviet Embassy of having offered
to carry information for the Soviet Embassy, volunteering as a Communist
a South African Communist, to give them information, two-thirds of which
turned out to be totally useless and false, which again might have been to
ingratiate herself. She was here in London after she was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 195

expelled, I'm not certain of the exact dates. She was also known to have slept around with almost every minister of the Tanganyikan government including Julius Nyerere. This is one of the reasons why there was so much hushhush about her, that she had obviously gotten a lot of information out of these fellows. She was very close to Oscar Gambona and she claimed that Oscar Bambona was going to get her back into the Foreign Ministry.

She was just Revolution's correspondent there. She did practically nothing. When she got out, she managed to keep her little office going. They didn't seize anything, and she turned over themailing list of her *Spearhead* magazine to *Revolution*. Verges had paid her £1000 deposit so she could do some work but she really didn't do anything, but she unlike Rosalind Ainslie, turned over the unspent portion of that to Verges when she came to London.and she wasn't interested really in continuing her work with *Revolution*. Being Indian of course posed a problem with any for her with anything to do with the Chinese. She was very close to the Indian community, as anyone who looks through that mailing list will see we have lots of missionary Indian businessness, and so forth in East Africa, who were taking subscriptions to the magazine more or less out of friendship and solidarity with another Indian. They didn't caremuch whether she was a Communist or not.

She was supposed to have been the mistress of Dr. Dadu. At least they say she slept with Dr. Dadu and they had a very close relationships to him. Dr. Dadu is the president of the Indian Congress for South Africa and a member of the Communist Party/ of South Africa, a very important members. BBcause Inften the Indians have holdings the Indian communiss has holdings up and down East Africa, Mozambique as well, their role in the liberation struggle is very equivocal.

Obviously the Africans want to go ahead while the Laaánds Indians are thinking - well-alpe Africanization meant to the Tai Indians The English used then as a sort of buffer,, preferred to bring an Indian clerk to East Africa rather than to train an African. That was a typical colonial maneuver but now it has put the Indians in a situation historically which is untenable, for a long period. You know people talk about multi-racial states but in East Africa it is a joke. It won't hold up. I don't think it will, anyway.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 196

# The Indian Congress of South Africa is related to the African National Congress, the Colored people's congress, all of this in a so-called Congress Alliance. She had contacts with the Africand- the ANT people. the ANC people here in London. They were suspicious of her as well. But she managed somehow to get back iny she was ill, she was in hospital Shevas hurtin an auto accident, and she had to have a very complicated bone operation That put her out of action for some time.

I don't know, but I heard that she is now back in Tanganyika. She may well be. She has quite a bit of money; her family has money. Of course the Indians do have money. She did very little for the magazine. She occasionally told me about people in the ANC who might do something for the magazine. But most of the people she told me abut were members of the South African Communist Party. That party has taken a pro-Moscow stand and most of its people don't want to do anything for Revolution, though we did have articles by Bryan Bunk another South African Communist. That was before their party took their stand on the Sino-Soviet conflict. And there is a struggle going on right now inside of the ANC.

That's a long complicated thing. That has nothing to do with Revolutin.

(On my list here we have Diallo))

Diallo is an adviser of the President of Mali-whatie-bio nana-

Modewa Keida...

Married to a French woman, ix Leftist, he knows Verges through friendship and offered to help. He put him in contact with who is Minister of Information, who is very, very pro-Chinese.

(In Mali)

Yes. When Chou en Lai visited Mali, you recalls that he got quite committed. There were some gratuitous, open handed #laps

There's nothing very much. He just knew him.

This is again-one-of--Verges-attempts to have a finger in another African -country

(Verges)

I didn't mention, with Phongbeah, one of the reasons that he kept phombeah was phombeah's connection with Odinga, 14 in Kenya. Phombeah at one time had hoped to be made the secretary of this new Lumumba Institute there, a ia Nairobi. Verges, odd as it may seen, had at one time, proposed himself as a sort of security adviserato Odinga. We felt that he continued to pay Dennis Phombeah for doing nothing mainly to keep a line of communication open to Odinga. He had met Odinga but got nowhere with him. In Algiers he was afraidatat Le Chinois


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 197

# President of Mali,
Keita. Married to a French woman. Leftist.
He knows Verges through friendship and offered to help. He put him in contact with a man by the name of Mogotogo (?)
who is Minister of Information, who is very very pro-Chinesey in Mali.
And when Chou en Lai visited Mali you recall that he got quite a committed welcome in Mali. And there were some gratuitous open-handed slaps the Russians made. Didn't have to be made but were.

((How did Verges and Diallo get together))

I don't know. He had known him for a considerable time. There is nothing very much. This is again one of Verges's attempts to have a finger in another African country. One of the reasons that he kept Phombeah was Phombeah's connection with Odinga.

If in Algiers he was referred to as Le Chinois, I don't think Odinga would accept him.

This is a real problem. He says, "well, we colored people and so forth" and it is true that he is part - he's Eurasian, but it is very hard for Africans to accept that. They just put him down as Chinese.

I don't know very much about Gama Diallo. He played very little role in the Magazine except that he was a contact inside of Mali. He came to France early last year, the spring of last year, with his wife. He went to Vichy for his health and drank the waters for two or three weeks and he saw Verges. Verges had ideas, had mentioned to Chen that if he couldn't keep the magazine going that he might go to Mali. Chen was going to be sent off to wherever, Viriato da Cruz of the Angolan Federation of Liberation, as adviser, and I was going to be sent to Indonesia for the Afro-Asian Journalists. That was how he was going to take care of everybody.

(How about Castro Da Silva)

Castro Da Silva is the pseudonym used for Viriato da Cruz, formerly of the MPLA, and now of the UPA. He is a poet, again, late thirties, married, has a child and is based are or less in Algiers. He has virtually no money at all. He has a small group which went into the UPA.

Holden Roberto, the head of the UPA is very suspicious of him, but nevertheless he needs him. He needs the Left. He has been to China and this give him a sort of gives the Chinese a guarantee, but on the other hand the Chinese didn't even want to give Viriato money to transfer


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 198

himself from Algiers to Brazzaville. And he was threatened by the MPLA
people, who are of course Sovietbacked to the hilt, in fact more so
Dr. Neto, *appartially* more than ever now. And the Algésians, Ben Bella,
who had supported the MPLA up until the great fiasco when people discovered
that they didn't have what they claimed to have-didnt have the infuence to have
given their support to the UPA. Nevertheless, the MPLA people still
remain and they are promising to reform and really carry out things
ideologically
I think that logically the MPLA is much more congenial to the Algerians
and to all of the
hard revolutionary line, people.

Holden Roberto is considered to be an American agent pure and simple
and always has been. In actual fact, he received a lot of money through
various Protestant missionary groups, American Protestant missionary groups.
And he himself is a Christian Protestant. These tie-ups have helped the
Rightists to back him. He did go off to China, made some Tailuw land
which the Chinese were pleased with.

The Chinese haven't made any real decisive choice between the MPLA and the
UPA. They're just waiting to see who is going to be able to produce.

((What about da Cruz): What is his function),

He has no function except to write articles about Angola, which he
has done, one of which he signed with his own name. He has very little
money and he hoped that Verges would be able to smooth the way with the
I understand,
Chinese, but alas! poor fellow, he learnt to his horror that Verges presumed
was by no means the Chinese agent that he served him to be. I understand
that he has virtually retired from politics . He is a poet. And he'd much
rather be a poet than anything else. He told me on several occasions that
in Paris when he came to my house there for dinner that he wished he could really
get out of the whole thing, what was he going to do, He didn't have a
passport, he had all these people sort of pushing him in
into this. He didn't have any money. He didn't know what to do.

((He lives in Paris))

No, he lives in Algiers. He is still in Algiers to, best of my knowledge,
He is one of the people in Algiers I would see. If I were to go to
Algiers I would look him up. He's not terribly dynamic but
events threw him up into a leading position and he sort of stuck
there and doesn't know how to get out. The Chinese Haven't given him
the all-out support that he had hoped for

((Neither have they turned him down))

No.

(Amilcar Cabrera))

That was a name used, not a pseudonym, a false name. It doesn't represent anyone, it represents the FALN of Venezuela in Europe. They have a bureau in France. I didn't really know them. I knew there were several people. One of them a graphic artist, whose drawings were printed in Revolution. They brought the things to him. They are authentic.

Because when Verges had a young French boy traveling through Latin America he went to Venezuela. They got him into the guerillas. They got him all around. We had some very authentic short-hand reports. So whoever they are they are authentic. They were very, very cautious, probably suspicious of me because I was an American, so I never had any real conversation with them.

(do you known anything about who Verges's link to them was))

(do you know if he still has them)

I know this, they asked him to remove the name Amilcar Cabrera and it has been removed, because it was identified with them. To then put in a note in the twelfth French edition that in the future he would receive an article from the information department of the FALN. They'd be foolish not to send material, but they didn't want to be identified with the editorial policy of the magazine. This many reflect various tendencies inside of the FALN which I have read about. I don't know anything first-hand that they split between a hard line, those who want to continue the real struggle and the sabotage struggle and those who want to look for possible negotiated solutions. One group that is a little more pro-Chinese.

In any case these people did represent the FALN, there is no doubt about it. I didn't know any of them. They never had any dealings with me.

((Patricia Magowan))

I know very little about her. She did this book on Portugal. She was connected with the - she has ties with the British Communist Party but also with Trotskyists. She was the one who found Rosalind Ainslie to work here in London for the magazine. She is the mistress of a man named Carlos

((Lanca?))

I'm not certain. That might be it. He is a European born in Mazambique, a Portuguese, who has been kept going by various African movements for years because he represents (laughing) te what the French call an interlocateur, when they want to call him out


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 200

obviously Neto does xxxx have some American support as well or had some American support. His father did, I think.

(Do you know Michael Tabasa)

No, never heard of him.

((We come to Maspero))

Maspero is just a third-generation French elite intellectual who has a little bit of money, runs a publishing house, and magazine, and who is extremely non-committed in his Left commitment. In other words he is a fortist but he is not a member of any party and is not really involved in active politics. His magazine more and more is taken over by Trotskyists That was not always the case at present. He came really to the fore with the Algerian War, Considering the failure of the French Communist Party to do anything about intellectuals, the the Algerian question, it was the Loft Intellectuals who were out of the party who responded, who made up the Jensen network, the support network for the the FLM underground in France, and who did the propaganda work and who gave the support. Is the FLM had French support it was among these people, not among the Communist party.

((Verges consistent efforts to))

Vean Yes.

To wand away authors (from Maspero). Hassan Riab wrote for his.

Chalion, whom he got for Revolution Africaine wrote for him and now is back again working for him, writing for hima. Casserl also. Chen also. Almost everyons. Even I knew him because he published student material and he used to things in the States and I had correspondence and I used to send hin material that we had.

(The competition between Verges and Maspero- was this a personal as opposed to ideological competition)

No it was personal. There is very littéè ideological about Verges.

Verges is an extremely heady, personal person. He is generous in many ways but even his generosity is personally. He is either for you. He is a grand patron. He is extremely generous with money when he has it, He throws it around. You could never go anywhere with Verges that he doesn't xxxx want to pay. Then we traveled it was most times first class, sexxxxanthingxsisex on a plane. He has a deep-seated desire to be big (he is a small man, he is short) to be talked about.

He wants publicity. He wants to be known. He doesn't have any real commit- ments, I don't think, that are terribly deep. And I'm certain that if he were sure of money from the other side, but nevertheless so that his name would stay big, I'll bet he'd. He wants money not for himselfs but for prestige After all Verges's father was the founder of the Communist Party-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 201

money not for itself but for prestige. After all, Verges's father was of the founder of the Communist party, Reunion, member of the French Assembly.
His brother is the head of the Communist party of *the title* "right now."
He grew up in this sort of French Left-wing upper class, which in France is a hereditary Left which goes all the way back to 1848 or before. Some families were extremely distinguished. They really had.
And he is in that sort of/ *thing* very much respected, just as you might respect, Flander family. You know that a member of such and such a family obviously must be Left because his grandfather and his greatgrandfather were.
(Maspero again)

Maspero fits just into that category.

(That same Leftist heritage)

That's right.

(Does he run his operation on a self-sustaining commercial basis)

More or less except that for instance he published a book on China recently, which the Chinese subsidized. I suspect that he has received some aid from the Italian Communist party. The Italians look with great favor on him because of his openness, his critical approach, his Anti-Stalinism. Andersson says he got money from the Chinese for this book on China.

Verges has tried desperately to smear him with the Chinese, but apparently the Chinese didn't give a damn.

(You said that the Trotskyists seem to be moving in on Maspero)

Yes.

(Would they be giving him any kind of financial aid)

I really doubt it. The Trotskyists generally are poor. I don't think so. I think that what it is, is that he is really short of hands, short of manuscripts, short of people who can think and produce something. And here are these Trotskyist-leaning intellectuals who don't have any outlet, so naturally... It's just that he doesn't have any sectarian feelings against them, so more and more tend to come in.

(Andre Belge)

Never heard of him.

(Neither have I in Nigeria)

Oh, Imokay is a student. He's no bureau man at all. He was a student at the university of Enuka. He distributed the magazine.

He never did anything else.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

He nuver did anything else. Just a student, graduttaxxja he has graduated nov. I think he is working in the government somewhere.

((Did he get paid))

No- oh yes, he did, he got a commission on subscriptions. He got 30 some subscriptionsfrom students at the university, in one week, as I recall which was unheard of. Just a student, and just be sheer chance he handled the magazine.

((Mme. Miichele Mestre))

Oh, My, Michele Nestre szansantazkaxx Madame Mestre I don't know anything about. Michel Mestre is one of Maspero's people. I thought it was a man. I've never met hin, don't know anything about him. I know there is a Michel Mestre who has written a number of books on the Congo- for Haspero. Had nothing to do with Verges although Verges did put out feelers to get this person, man or woman, to work for Revolution. He wasn't successful. It was part of his general campaign of leaving Maspero with no authors at all.

(Rosalinde Ainslie)

She's married., She works for the East German news agency APHS She is obviously connected with the South African Communist party. She is a member of the Congress Alliance in South Africa and she is married to an Indian.

She has some children and she lives here in London. She comes from a wealthy family in South Africa, I imagine. She was found by Patricia Magowan Pinheiro to work for Revolution. That flopped, after a short period. They didn't know which way to go, to stick with the Algerians or stick with Verges. The business of the magazine being pro-Chinese by no means was obvious, nor even clear in Verges's mind/ The magazine wasnt pro-Chinese-for an awful long time, It wasn't a question of being pro- Chinese. Certainly not when I was hired. It was Algerian, that was all.

((Americans attending subversive sabotage school in Prague))

I never heard of a subversive sabotage school in Prague. The Americans (who ware) that I have known going through Prague have gone to Havana.

((Between Moscow and Havana en route))

Yes. I go don't know anything about a subversive sabotage school. I don't doubt that there might 'bo one. I imagine there's one in Washington too.

((I never heard of it. Either one))

(Laughs)

((Current addresses of some of these people))

Well, who do you want? Chên now, has no address. He sleeps around


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 203

everywhere. He literally was sleeping on my floor at one point.
If you had told me, I could have brought my book. I gave you people whom
I contacted on my trip.

I can give you his- 74 Hassent Roadt London NW 11

FALN- they have an office here in London., I don't have much.

Mamani, P 35, Plateau Sallorca, 121 Rue Mouridosk,
Algiers. I have a bigger address book at home.

Ghana
((You mentioned Dubois. Do you know very much about his group in Ghana)

Dr. Dubois had a number of people around him but he was an elderly
man; he was more interested in producing the African Encyclopoedia than
anything else, which he did set up before his death. His wife is now
one of the directors of Ghana television. She is a Ghana citizen, she has
renounced her American citizenship. There are a number of people who are
close to her or were close to Br. Dubois such as Dr. Alpheus Hunton
who is an American Negro who has written on Africa, washed and works for
the enclyclopoedia, Ghana Institute He was a member of the Communist
party of the US. I think Shirley Graham may have been a member. Certainly
Dr. Dubois became a member several years before his death. At the time of
his death he was extremely pro-Chinese and was very unhappy. His wife,
Shirley Graham Dubois, is very pro-Chinese. There is William Gardner Smith,
an American Negro writer, who works for Ghana radio and who worked with me
at the AgenceFrance Presse in Paris. Smith is close to Shirley Graham,
or was. Harfield, There is a girl by the name of Maya Angelou, who was
married, still married but separated, to form representative of the PAC,

# South Africa, in Accra. He has been removed from his post for misappropria-
tion of funds- Musisi Make. Those are the ones that I know of.

(Subsidiary question- Hammer and Steel Group ))

The Hammer and Steel group in Boston is an alleged Chinese group that
operates in Boston, former meters of the US Communist Party.

After a period of inactivity has suddenly become active and not more than
a few days ago, while I was out of the country, without any effort on my
behalf they had my address here and I received two of their publications.

Two recent publications, here in London, which were sent to my London
address. So someone here someplace, has sent them ny new address.
Very interesting that they should have it. We had an exchange with the Revolution, but I had not kept this up. They have just formed a
so-called New England party of Labor which is supposed to be the Chinese
party, Marxist-Leninist party, and is opposed and they give the reasons for


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 204

their opposition to the progressive labor group and to the POC, Provisional Organizing Committee for a new Marxist-Leninist party which was an old pro-Albanian group. Progressive Labor is of course a split-off the Communist party and split off because of the Cuban revolution and civil rights question and so forth. *POC* almost has a large number of Negro and Puerto Rican members, the majority of them. PL has a number of Negro contacts extremely active in the South but has made some serious mistakes. They had people in Monroe, North Carolina, after Williams, taking Williams place they had a white man, which is a ridiculous thing to do. They didn't understand what "black determination" nationalism means.

This new Hammer and Steel group, which has been a sort of group without a party, has now announced the formation of this New England Party of Labor which they hope will be the nucleus of a new Chinese Communist Party in the United States. But I don't know anything about them. (sic!!)

(Switzerland)

How long were you in Lausanne.

December

From March, 1963, to September of '63. Then I used to go back every month.

((What contact did you maintain there))

With Andersson.

((Did you have any American contacts))

No. What do you mean- with the American Embassy?

((Any Arab contacts))

No. Just the people that came in and out of Andersson's place. But I didn't. Being an American I was very much aware of the fact that everybody was suspicious of me. So I made it a point not to bother.

((You talked about Drapeau Rouge. Red Flag))

(laughing) Who is John Llewellyn Davis! That sounds like something out of- - - The Drapeau Rouge group is a group of young, French students, university and licee students who had been connected with the youth group of the JSU which is the PSU, the Nenni Socialist Party in France. This was their youth group. They were dissatisfied with

- - for instance, the Belgian section, Arras. One of the boys had been in Chen's philosophy class in Licee had got in touch with Chen and he had given them advise and helped them to form this group, etc


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

or to continue
they entertained the group and it produced a news letter. He had promised then money, they put out one issue, and he never got any money. I heard that they were in contact with the Clichy group down and were seeking some sort of recognition there, and among the things that they had promised they did a self-criticism admitting that they had done wrong to have accepted Kir’s supervision and saying that they will never do this again.

((John Llewellyn Davis, you say who the hell is he))

Yes.

((We talked about Pablof Is this Michael R))

He is a member of the Trotskyist IVth International - or was. He has been expelled for his heretical views, not that they all don't have heretical views, but his were extremely pro-Algerian. I think he has become an Algerian citizen. He is Belgian, I believe, or Dutch, but think it is Belgian. He was arrested in Holland. He worked for the FLN during the War, went to Algeria, was arrested in Holland, spent some time in Jail, was released, went to Algiers with his wife and became very active in the Bureau de Biens Vacantes, and then later the Bureau of the Socialist Sector. His mifflumen has been of an ideological nature and he has very close ties with the Yugoslavs, and despite his Trotskyism and he has now been expelled, he is also not at all persons non grata with the Soviets, He has a group called Pabloites.

((How did he hit on Pablo))

This was his nom de guerre, I suppose.

He represented for a while a majority tendency in the international Trotskyist movement. helped by the American SWP Socialist Workers Party. Finally expelled. I don't know the ins and outs of the Trotskyists very much.

((When did you first run into him))

I heard of him for years. The first time I saw him in the flesh was sitting in a cafe in Algiers. I never had anything to do with him. He used to hang out in a cafe which was right under the offices of Revolution Africaine, which was sort of a center for European Leftists and whatnot. It was called the Cafe

((Did he ever have anything to do with Revolution))

He made have had something to do with it later with Harbi but not under Verges.

((I meant in Europe, not Algiers.))

No, no, nothing.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

# (Do you know anything about the formerly dissident PDP of Montreux)

The Pro-Chinese Communist party of Switzerland)

They've got it wrong. There's only one pro-Chinese Communist party and that's the so-called *Baxter Parti Comuniste Suisse*, started in *Verve*, not Monteaux, *Vevey*, *Nestle's* headquarters. Headed by Gerard Buillard, a small businessman who has become a member of the PLP, that the Compurist Party. Then to Albania last year, summer, as a tourist, and sold the Albanians on the idea of supporting a breakaway Marxist-Leninist party. He came back to Switzerland and with five people formed this Swiss Communist Party, which grew, they often 35 people. Andersson was hostile at first, but when the Chinese took a more benevolent view on it in Berne, he went along, and he may have received some money from the Chinese, I don't know. But we know that he received money from Albania.

He became increasingly quarrelsome, he was very much worried about Anderssa becauset Andersson was printing his newspaper, *L'Etincelle*, The Spark. He owned this offset press in Lausanne Anderson also was recruiting people for the group and he has more connections inside the Communist party, the PLP, than Bulliard did, since he had been only a recent member. The Lausanne group became larger than the Verve group. I don't know what happened after that. But then, relations deteriorated rapidly and both the Albanians and the Chinese realized that they had made a drastic mistake.

Builliard then phoned the Albanians and the Chinese in Berne and told them that if he didn't receive 3000 francs by a certain time of day that he would denounce Andersson to the police. Obviously, he didn't receive the 3000 francs and he went to the police, Apparently they knew more than Builliard about him. Then he got a delegation and went to the Federal Council, to the Parliament in Berne, and they made an open public request that this foreign agent, this Swedish national, who had taken advantage of Swiss hospitality, be expelled. The Federal Police came in. They banned and there was the gneral blowup. They didn't get very far, except that now it is suspected that he is more or less subsidized by the Swiss police, that he is keeping going and his group, is down to about 15 people, according to Andersson.

He obviously has a small amount of money which he is not getting, from the Chinese. He told Andersson, he proposed that Andersson retire from politics, if he would be paid the sum of 5,200 Swiss francs,

The reason for this was he wanted to keep the nimeograph machine that he had given him and he was deducting I think he wanted 7,000 francs altogether for his exit from politics.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 207

but he was willing to deduct the price of the mimeograph machine.

He didn't receive that either. No he can't be considered very (important).

At one point, to show you how silly he is, he was in contact with Kevin?
DELVIN!
Delman of Radio Free Europe, in Munich, asking him to organize a meeting for him there. This I found out through the Congress for Cultural Freedom people. with his furniture business and his wine business. He also sells wine. and persons involved in ((Relationship of Revolution with the Leftist review in Great Britain)

They didn't particularly agree with the views of Revolution but they were sympathetic neverthess. They are leftis, some inside the Labor Party, people like Belogh, Thomas Batte, one of the economic advisers, very well connected there. They helped us here for a while. Hansa Alavi had friends (among them).

Dennis Phombeah also knew the editors, Perry Anderson, Roger Murray, who is now in Ghana, professor Hodgkins of the African Study Sustitute in Accra

There was no connection other than that, sympathetic cooperation.

They were willing to help. Their views are quite different. They're not Communists. We weren't Communist either.

((They didn't buy space. You just swapped ads))

Yes. That's a normal arrangement between magazines. You exchange advertising.

((Movement for Colonial Freedom)

Movement for Colonial Freedom is the same We got very little real cooperation from Movement for Colonial Freedom. We exchanged ads, they promised to accept subscriptions on our behalf but John Eber, who is the Secretary), was very much afraid that he might lose Algerian support, because Movement for Colonial Freedom depends on getting support from all different African countries, Asian countries, etc.

Therefore anything that might be anti-governmental in terms of Algeria he was very much afraid of. He is an ex-Communist. He told me - "What are you doing going around with Phombeah? He has been here with Harbi, the week before you come with him. Which side are they on?" Phombeah walked in just as he was saying this, and overheard it. He was very embarrassed, he had to go on with it. Phombeah said, "I'm just helping all the brothers- -" (laughing) He was hopeless.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

I have both children home now. This is mid-term, so the little boy is out.

My exact address Stockley Hall an apartment house on Prince Albert Road, 21-31 engrance. 4th floor.

Cannot give definitive answer for some time, would advise- play it reasonably safe, maintain access you have or could reestablish.

My problem short range. I need money by next week. I have people who want me to write things. The things about *Revolution*, nobody particularly will care about. That's no embarrassment to anybody.

Not even to the Chinese. Andersson said in fact they would be rather pleased with it, if somebody would finally get this off their backs, because they can't say anything at all. I'm committed to write the article for *Encounter*. There's a letter, which is appearing in the current issue of the *China Quarterly*. The question is what to do with the *Atlantic Monthly* people.

I've got to arrange something quickly. I didn't expect the situation to crop up quite so quickly as this. It was relatively well taken care of when I left here, with my brother-in-law but my wife has gone and fired up, louced up some things with her brother which makes it extremely difficult. I can probably get some more money, but not very much more out of the *Encounter* people. They have already given me a large sum of money, more than they expected, expected Atlantic Monthly to come through and pick up pocket of it, which they never did. Now it is a question of exchange of letters. So far as *Revolution* concerned, - I can continue this article, but I have the problem of getting money. That should be self-evident.

Anyway, I shall try to hold things off. I'm going to try to see if I can arrange somethingas a temporary emergency measure this afternoon. Jif I can and if I'm successful, then everything will be fall right for till the end of next week.

(I can let you have $200 this afternoon.)

That would certainly be a great. That would be very helpful. That would solve my needs-- Thirty-five pounds. How muchis £35, in dollars?

((Under $150.00))

That's what, I need. That's what I actually needy Immediately. I take care of that I'm off the hook until next week. Now I've got to go and clear myself with Lasky of *Encounter*. You haven't been in touch with Lasky in any way, have you, with these *Encounter* people?

(NO)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

Well, somebody has. Some very strange - you see the Congress for Cultural Freedom are sort of pushing in the background, and I know vaguely that they have the idea that maybe, that I might like to take a job with them in Paris. Personally I'm not terribly keen on some of the things the Congress for Cultural Freedom does. Some things are not too bad, besides the pay. But worse still, my wife would just about blow sky high over the Congress for Cultural Freedom, even though she knows *Chi Quarterly* and *Encounter* were subsidized by the Congress for Cultural Freedom. *Encounter* is no longer. But there has been a lot of hankypank going on between them. Even the letter- I told you about the letter. They did everything possible to try to keep the editor of *Chi Quarterly* to keep from printing the letter, telling him all sorts of reasons, that it would blow my cover completely, and then the money that I got from *Encounter*, Lasky, said well, maybe you won't write anything at all. I don't know, why give me any money at all, send me off to write.

((I don't know. You're talking mysteries to me))

As I say there are verious people who are hovering around and since I've been back, now here is the truth, he hasn't bothered to really, to find out what I have.

((Couple of questions occur to me-- you mention the possibility of going to Paris to work for Congress for Cultural Freddom...

Would you also be interested if things worked out, in going back to Algeria)

Oh, yes.

(To stay)

Sure. Certainly. All I need is a proper cover, one that is not that's very hard. The suspicions of these groups are extremely slight. There was a feklow, we haven't mentioned. You've probably heard about Dr. Robert Ramsey who was an American who was in Zanzibar. He's now locked up in jail in Algeria. He may be a Negro although I doubt it. I've never met him. I think that he's white, Member of the NAACP and all sorts of things. I forget what he's a doctor of M.D.

He was sending out letters in favor of the Zanzibar revolution.

Then he claimed he was expelled from Kenya by sinister forces. He didn't have a US passport. He was here without a passport, For a short time the National Council for Civil Liberties gave him some support and the next thing I knew he was in Algeria. Now what is game is, and whether he is just a crackpot God knows. Everything-Revolution and revoltionary movement brings forth such a bunch of screwballs as one can only see inside


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

a madhouse, you know. I

(He's now in jail?)

Now in jail, in Algeria no charges against him. I understand the US Embassy is trying to get him out (laughing). I don't know whether Dr. Ramsey was actually an agent of some kind, although he had too many confusions to be really a good agent. Yes, too confused. There was too much wrong. In any case, what I found was that people were generally, if you had something to do and didn't live too lavishly, though Africans don't question too much on money. This business of feathering one's nest goes on all over Africa, apparently in Algeria now more than ever.

Andersson said there are large transfers of money Algerian francs into Switzerland being bought up by the opposition even still for their own purposes, one day.

Yes, Algeria would be fine-- provided I could find some reasonable

- any kind of a newspaper assignment, a vaguely Left thing, better than anything else. but the more innocuous the better.

(You said once before, you fit well in Algeria, you didn't fit well in Black Africa)

I could move throughout Africa, but one has to chart start ones-thing. Forinstance, for me to go to Ghana would create, at this point, innumerable suspicions, but to go to Algeria when I have people like Georges Arnoux who is a very close personal friend, they would welcome me, and try to find something for me to do .

That would be easy, to arrange. And from there I have South African friends. With both PAC and ANC and MK, I have very good contacts. Wherever they have offices I can move inside. But one has to have some reasonable sort of thing. On this trip I used some of the Afro-American journals, the magazine (Encounter) which was quite successful in some places.

In fact Griffa said, "why don't I have this magazine. They send it to Berges and don't send it to me." Nevertheless with Griffa there was some suspicion. And I had the opinion-- I'm not paranoic and I don't like playing cops and robbers- or go for cloak and dagger stuff, but I had the opinion that somebody was watching me, was following me when I left there, which was one reason why I didn't see all the people I was going to see.

I knew some Trotskyists there who (could) give me some stories about Griffa's organization - they're on the fringes of it, etc.- but I just didn't go to see them because I thought that Griffa might have someone watching to see where I was going. He wouldn't like the connection with Trotskyites, anyway.

The kids know all about the cherry tree.

((Can you come on Tuesday))

Yes. But my coming in and out of this Embassy is not the best thing in the world. Right over there are the Indonesians, whom I know.

Around the corner are the Cubans who know me very well. All it would take is one Cuban to see me walk in here.... I can always concoct a reason but . . I don't know how many people are watching. For one thing, certainly the British Home Office, they've had me under surveillance ever since

I've been here . There's no doubt about that. I got a tip on that from tim Ennals
Mark Bagel of the National Council of Civil Libertiesiac.
British may be allies and all, but get all....

As far as my wife is concerned, she is by no means a dyed-in-the-wool Communist. She is not a Communist at all, never has been, but she would not like that in the slightest.

((What do you think about that - Malcolm X))

I could have told you it was coming.

((Well, you did. You didn't single out Malcolm X))
make
it becomes
Now comes the real thing. It's going to affect the Algerian struggle.

You remember the Algerian struggle throughout was marked by clashes between the MNA and the FLN right up to and after the Independence. And this is what is going to happen now in the States, as far as I can see. But what I don't really like is -- there are so many small groups, uncontrollable little groups, kids, fifteen-year-old kids who are planning to shoot the President, and that sort of thing. You don't know how far it goes.

So the idea of being a leader- leader of what? As to Black Ghettoes, there this thing-- I don't know (who responsible).

((Do you think that was Elijah))

I'm not at all certain. There are many, many, many people who would be glad to see Malcolm out of the way. For one thing, it does resolve a certain problem and that -is, there was a clash, certainly it was going to come about between Williams's group and Boggs' men in Detroitx and Malcolm X, people who were more committed to an armed struggle. Malcolm's major contradiction was that he said-- logically, what he was preaching would have led even to negotiations with Washington, to some kind of arrangement, or else to an armed struggle, an underground struggle. As soon as you have a vocal leader who is exposed and who is in the country, one hand he knew what was happening. He was very much aware of this proliferation of groups and activities, like the little business of Walter Bove, which was highly innocuous, in comparison highly symbolic and almost innocuous, in comparison with some of the things. His trips abroad, most of his trips abroad were in a way - he wanted to create unity by contacts with Williams and others people, but here, in Europe and Cairo. One of the problems that he had was simply in getting to Williams. He didn't want to go to Havana. He probably could have brought an extraordinary amount of pressure on the State Department to allow him to go as a journalist or something like that if he really wanted to. But he didn't want to, because he didn't want to be exposed on political issue which might have cost him support. So where was he going to see Williams? Prague, perhaps, Moscow. But he didn't want to go to Eastern European countries either.

((You said that one of his might have been to negotiate with


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 214

Washington ))

Exactly. At first the whole idea was that there was going to be a Black State. This was originally. But no one had any real. . . except for Elijah Muhammed's people -- I think that some of them did have. You saw the London Times article today? One of the things that disgusted him with the Elijah group was this talks with the American Nazi Party and with the Ku Klux Klan, particularly with the Klan, to buy a county, if you will, a county in Georgia, which the Ku Klux Klan was going to sell. They were going to see that all property in the country was turned over and this was going to be the nucleus of a Black State. He felt that the Muslims were seeking to perpetuate segregation for their purposes. He really was not a segregationist nor did he at the end believe in - he wasn't a racist.

This is whole thing, backing away from a religous point, from a racist poia trying to find some modus vivendi for a modified Black nationalism. But he wanted to talks this over. Ikixx*sxkisx I don't know if he ever had any contacts with anyone beside New York City and State officials and police.

He had rather good relations. He was extremely moderate in person and you could talk to him. I think this is what he really wanted or what would have come out of it. He just wanted the contact - to feel that there was somebody opposite him. To a lot of these people, thisx a lot of the stink could be taken out just ke by talking to them, not necessarily with publicity.

for benefit
((Is he wasn't involved on the racial or theological grounds, what was))

Not a racist. For instance, it is said that the Muslims are anti-white and there is an anti-white elements, and particularly and an anti-Semitic directed elements, against Jewish shopkeepers. Obviously the Jewish shopkeepers, being exposed, being in the Ghetto, the resentment comes out against then. In New York it comes out against the Jewish element in the garment district. as many Negroes work in the garment district. It is unskilled, underpaid. and sweat shop type of thing. I must say that Malcolm sometimes played this tune himself. He knew it was facile, and also it pleased the Arabs. fxpxxxjx from whom he received considerable support.

(You mean the Cairo type Arabs?))

Yess, the Nassertype. I don't know how much support he ever received financially, but I think they did receive support. And also the Black Muslimsx did receive support at certain times. It was no accident that he set kup a headquarters in exile in Cairo. He did go to Ghana and I know that in Ghana he was attacked by the orthodox Marxists. They are the first to launch an attack, for Black fascisa or something. I feel that he was evolving, trying to get out of a box. His reaction was that of a Negro who


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 215

gose up in a Ghetto, who becomes a criminal under pressures, he is intellignt he ix extremely intelligent. Not an intellectual but far more capable as an organizer say, than Willians. Williams is utterly hopeless. And He is not slow to catch ideas, but he has certain fixed ideas which have developed, certainly under pressure. Malcolm was moving and he as a figure could have done a lotto0.

((Was this a maturing))

Yes, a maturing, a process of facing reality also. I suppose this is an explanation to a large extent of why there are so many children who are young kids, who are really involved in the nationalist movement. They're facile, frustrated. They don't know what elsel They feel that the older organizations are i acapable of doing anything for them. There is a class thing. They feel that there is sort of a Black bourgeoisie for whom there is now in general a

has sold them out, but they, possibility of integration, but they who live in the Ghettoes, who go to the bad schools, who come out of poor homes and so forth, by the time they're sixteen, they their hope of, their the real hopes of integration, of being something in contemporary American society, is dead. It's this whole business, the motivation in schools, the good schools, the housing and the family even. If a child grows up in a home where they don't have books- there is a great difference between a Jewish child in the Lower East Side, xxex no matter how poor that family, motivated by a kaks long Jewish tradition, sxxxxxx and a Negro child or a Puerto Rican child, Middle Class ideals are beginning to sink down into the devishxanax Negro community, but among Puerto Ricans there is an even greater gap, so I understand, -----

Many of these Negro kids, they just feel this enormous wall around them, and one of the things that I am most aware of, even-- when I was a child, I grew up in Philadelphia. Many of my friends were white. We lived in a neighborhood in West Philadelphia which had Negro and white Irish, Cathelies, Jewish people, Italian, in proximity. Lived in the same block. That neighborhood now is solidly black. The shool I went to was always mixed. Now most of these schools are black. There is more segregati today, yhrough real estate, through housing, than there was 20 years ago.

((Is this intentional or is this because this was an area that was mised and where a Negro could nove in and so Negroes did.))

Yes. One of the problems is that around most American cities the city line marks the end of expansion for Negroes. They can't move into the suburbs. A middle class Negro who has money can nove into the sububys. And what areas they can move into are filled up. The whites flee out of

the city, xX

((Washington would be the primary example of that))

Washington is that much more complicated because you are in the midst of the Southern States. Except that I notice, I have relatives that live around Washington. As a kid I used to go to Washington every summer. And going out towards Chevy Chase and Montgomery county, the Maryland side, there is a certain desegregation that has gone on. Obviously on the Virgini side it is the opposite. Also the Maryland counties to the South. That is a more segregated area. That is also the history-- the sort of slave line. in Maryland before the Civil War sort of went where Washington is now. across the State, to the South were they grow tobacco there was slavery, to the North there was no slavery. And there was a great deal of intermarriage- not intermarriage but racial intermixture. I have relatives who are to all intents and purposes white. When I was a child and went there in the summer, I really had no real awareness of race. It was a curious background of interracial mixture, that had gone on just before and after the Civil War. Now that has changed considerably., That's in Montgomery county.

I brought the address book.

((It's extremely interesting to consider the racial problem at home but I would like to finish this up.))

Yes. What sort of addresses do you want.

Vokegra Is a very interesting person, in Holland. He is a man who works with Andersson occasionally. He is not a Communist, is a vague Leftist with the Christian Pacifists, the Pacifist Socialist Party, in Holland, which has gathered in a strange grouping of Leftists. He has and Algerians. contacts with the Angolans. He goes to Algeria quite often. I have a feelin' he is somewhat connected with the Girtut people.

Verges put this person's name- I don't know whether it is a man or woman- think it's a woman- on the magazine, actually never received xxtxin anything from her. I heard later that she was pro-Moscow, certainly not pro-Chinese. She's probably in jail now, after the coup down there.

Gregoris Goldenberg, in Peking, is Chilean. He works, think he works, inside of the Foreign Languages press. He is correspondent for El Mundo of Havana. At one time he was correspondent for the Cuban radio. He was a very curious fellow. He wanted to set ia up a Spanish edition of Revolution with Chinese money and offered to do this, when he came through Paris, butx about a year ago. Verges managed to avoid ever giving him any answer on this. He actually offered to bring the money. for this.

Carlos Moore. I have no address for him. He is an Afro-Cuban boy whom I first met in New York. He is in Paris and you might be able to reach him through *Presence Africaine*. He supposediy was writing a book about Cuba
He was very much involved with Hobert Williams, with Malcolm X, he is extremely young but very active in bady. He is of Jamaican origin. There is a Jamaican minority in eastern Cuba, in Camaguey and Oriente Province. That's how you get names like Moore, etc. His father and brother live in New York, his motheris still in Cuba. He went back to Cuba after the Bay of Pigs, and went to school there. He became very disillusioned.
He left, claiming that there was racial discrimination and so forth in Cuba.
He went to Cairo. He managed to get out, and he went on a Yugoslav ship, I think or a Greek ship, and got to Egypt. He had met some Angolans.
of the UPA who had been in Havana and they took care of him for a while until there was a split inside of the UPA, and the fellow who was there quit and went to Switzerland. He brought Moore out to Switzerland. Then Carlos wound up in Paris, where still is, to best of my knowledge.
He supposedly has written an article for *Presence Africaine* which is violently counter-revolutionary.
He claims there is no revolution.
His position, is relatively *bizarre*. It's not terribly justified.
But what I think is, that here is a case of Black Nationalism in the States being transported to Cuba. What he claims is that the only Cuban revolution that remains to be made that would be valid would be a black revolution. and that reallay the population of Cuba is overwhelmingly black, or of African descent, and that this has been a plot that has gone on for generations even now fith Fidel Castro, particularly Dorticos, he claims, the white leadership has been able to perpetuate itself regardless of the political thing. This is his theme. He is interesting but extremely wild and emotional. I think it's a case where the intoxication of Harlem never went off. Anyway he might be worth talking to.
The Congress for Cultural Freedom people were going to try to get in touch with him but they weren't any too convinced that his thesis was correct. I don't think so. He claims of course that I am completely blinded by my pro-Castro sympathies. He claimed that Williams was very unhappy for racial reasons in Cuba. I thought that Williams was simply unhappy, He couldn't speak Spanish. He was under pressurex from the American Communists and Soveit Communists that didn't like him, the old Cuban Communists, which was one of the reasons for his wholehearted tura towards Peking.
That was the only way out. And he wanted to come back to the States.

There is an outfit called the Philippine Review which I think we (Revolution) gave publicity to- here it is-- the Progressive Review. It is connected with Pomeroy. They are about as Communist as they can get under the present xxi an law of the Philippines. They have hopes of what they call the Anti-Imperialist ground swell, in other words, an anti-American trend in the present government. They felt that the anti-Malaysia campaign might help, and the editor has been very much in contact with the Indonesians. He has been to Djakarta on several occasions recently. He is in contact with Pomeroy. Pomeroy's of what he says position is one inwhich he has to be very careful because the British Communists will dump him.

Nothing more unless it was to give prestigex to the enterprise. This

editorial board, then he changed the title, to advisory board. then he
calls it permanent collaborators. I don't know why. He claimed that

seized in France. That was No. 7 which had Ho Chi Minh on the

Reunion and the French West Indies. It was a platonic seizure, more in the
vay of a warning. The seizure order came down after the matazine had been
distributed. There were virtually no copies picked up-. Undistributed
and returned copies were seized but the money wasn't seized. That's about
the nicest way you can seize a magazine. It was a warning. And he felt
that an editorial board made af up of foreigners didn't give him enough
protection in France. That was the reason for changingx to permanent
collaboration.

They certainly are quite active. For instance, the Colombian I mentioned-
I still can't think of his name-- but his daughter was put in an Albanian school. Poor girl, about eleven years old, and she didn't know a word of Albanian and most of the Albanians didn't know Spanish. She has managed to suffer through a year of it. 8 It is very interesting to talk to this little girl, now about 12, she was in Cuba, where you might think of the revolution as extremely informal lax in many ways easy-going. It's a libertarian type of revolution. Certainly it hasn't had the puritannical type of after-period that one finds in most revolutions, certainly ba and thess-the-puritans in China which proves a great obstacle for the Africans who go there. They are virtually unable to keep African students because of the fact that there is no sex. They used to let then go to HongKong and they would all come back with syphilis and gonorrhea to the great disgust of the Chinese. This girl, who seemed to tisk like Cuba, in Albania was shocked by the degree of formality of relationships and for instance she said that at the beaches in Cuba all the beaches were open, anybody can t go to the beach. In Albania they have, as I suppose you find in many Communist countries, high officials, middle officials, low officials and then just plain working people. (21

This to her was (shocking). The wasn't aware of politics as such and that is what made talking to her so interesting.

((What do you think of Cuba nowadays?))

I know one thing, that the PSC has virtually been defeated in every way, the old Communists. I was very much involved, obviously, the Cubans who were my friends xaxe Communists. I suppose that one of the things that made the Cuban revolution attractive was that it wasn't doctrinaire.

For Americans, college students, the young people, it after all of the years of disenchantment about revolution as such, the Cuban revolution looked like a romantic thing. It was extravagant. All these bearded fellows coming out of the mountains, and anyone who went to Cuba coulnd't help but feel the contagion.nf

((I think there was a sympathetic feeling within the States because it was not alien to our own revolutionary background, the idea of little menhiding behind trees shooting at the Redcoats.))

Eight. Only they were shooting at Batista's troops who were armed by the United States. This is one of the things that many Americans are unable to realize, how deeply involved the US is with these military regimes.

It has obviously been exploited fromtheer point of view, but from the popular imagination, we just don't think of it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 224

# The Fidelista youth were not Marxist. They are more so today than
they were before, but they have had this experience of dealing with the
United States - I have had a lot of arguments with them about it.
For instance when they came to the United States ini- 48 March of 59,
you remember, Felipe Pasos (?) came, Fidel went to Washington and he weat
to New York and it was extraordinarly badly handled. Christian Herter
wouldn't see him at the State Department. He insisted on taking a hotel
suite, rather than do that. Certainly it wasn't an official visit but
a lot of people have gone to Washington xxx. Then it was a question
of whether the Cubans wanted money or not. The Cubans claimed,
. . that they asked for $3,000,000 on short term credit, just a stop-gap
    and that this was turned down cold. until they made some guarantees
    about American property. From that point on I think that their attitude
    towards the United States was one of expecting, looking for the worst.
    They were able to work out a few arrangements with axfax Americancompanies
    concerning take-over. Each time, they were vetoed by the State Department
    or someone else, who said don't go into this, because we want to have a
    solid front, no one should make an agreement with them otherwise.
    It was provocation and counterprovocation. They would do something
    then there would be American xxtinn reaction, then a Cuban counterreaction
    until it was real escalation, diplomatically, to the point at which it
    fell completely into the hands of the Russians. That could have been
    short-circuited and prevented. They really are not happy where they are
    now. They want some independence, of oven the Soviet Union. Ideologically
    they are not very happy with the Russians. They have managed though to
    maintain incredible independence, not signing the nuclear test ban agreement,
    they have never made any anti-Chinese statements at all, though Fidel
    came very close-- he did in one of the statments where Kruschev mentioned
    peaceful coexistence, and said that there had never been disagreement
    with the Russians over the missiles .xxxxxxxx In actual fact they were
    boiling. They were furious about the missile business. This left a bad
    taste in their mouths. The Escalante business, you know the president
    of the old & PSC was going to take over and create a faction which would
    displace the romantic revolutionaries, if you will. It failed but that
    didn't mean that Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and more capable technocrats
    inside the party didn't continue. They failed. Now Carlos Rafael who
    had the highest place of the old Communists is out as you know. And almost
    all of then went out at this point.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 225

I am always struck by - Grippa said, for intance, of Guillermo Cabrera Infante, the Cuban Cultural Attache in Brussels, whom I know very well, that: "he's an anti-Communist". Which is true. He is a nationalist. That's all. And that's the one thing that keeps him there. But he and many of the people like Carlos Franqui and around Carlos Franqui and Haidee Santamaria. her husband, who is the Minister of Education, thoy are liberal, in their views about the arts, they are non-dogmatic, non-doctrinaire, Leftist if you will, but Leftist by situation and circumstance,

They represent, if there is anyone in Washington who still has a sober about Cuba and mind/who is not completely filled with venom/or - and/frustration- about Cuba, they would, I think, represent the real hope of reaching a *modus vivendi* in the future. They are the real heirs, I think, the people

who will take over. I do not think the PSC can do it. They have the mass support in the country behind them. It is always said, that If anything ever happens to Fidel and the slightest suspicion that it was done by a communist, there wouldn't be a Communist left alive in the Island in about five hours. These were many people who felt that the Communists would have liked to do this. At one time it became almost a hysterical rumor spread around that the Communists wanted to kill Fidel.

The bitterness that I found against the old Communists was because they were compromised with Batista. Even now, this explains their pro-Chinese stand. But that can't go very far, either. Because they are not doctrinaire. The Chinese have been extremely flexible in dealing with Cuba - they can't offer them very much - and they can't push them, so they have been easy-going. The handling of the October crisis between the Russians and the United States when they got kiex together over the heads of the Cubans, was an insult. Being a small country and semi-colonial, it was a colony, it has an exaggerated sense of its national rights. This was, in terms of Cuba, sot the worldxxbaixafxxx, situation in general, for the *penapis*. it was the only way to solve the October question, it seemed to be the only way, but in the terms of Cuba that was one of the grave mistakes of the Russians. The way the handled it. They didn't seem to soften the blow for the Cubans.

((They're very sensistive people.))

Right. And they've never forgotten it. They have nourished lots of hopes about DeGaulle and the possibility of trade with France. Trade is increasing, but they've tried desperately to get DEGaulle to visit Cuba which he wouldn't do. He would do lots of things against Washington, but there are certain limits (laughing), and that's one of them.

I know that's one of the things in back of their minds, in Paris.
about,

One of the things also encouraged is the increase of Spanish trade.

Ironically one of the heroes of Cuba is Franco, because he continued
and th you know when we go to Madrid, there is always trouble on the mental revolution
trade"I have a feeling that the Spanish
attitude has some influence on the French. I would imagine that they hope
that eventually this will be communicated to the West Germans.

Cuba certainly, I feel, if they did have sxekatsex diversification of
trade and an opening horizon because so many problems with the United government or
States become emotional problems that no matter what the head of the
State wants to do, you've got the problem of how to put it before the
Congress and public opinnon, which has been so sensitized to it that this
is the problem of American statesmanship that you don't have in any other
places. De Gaulle but even he wouldn't go beyond a certain
point.

Another thing, Algeria. Probably only DeGaulle cold have reached a
settlement.i

((In two minutes, that's your prognosis for future Duh US-Cuban
relations.))

It depends *very* much on the United States. I think, I know, there are
elements in Cuba who are more than willing. But they don't want to be
pushed. The trouble is that when a Cuban talks to America, the next question
is "when are you going to get rid of the Red regime," or something like that

That is the end of dix the dialogue. I would inxgain*x*xx imagine that it
would have to be through talks. I understand this is one thing thatthis

That they would love to have contact. I certainly know that Dr. Roa, Foreign
Minister, wanted somehow to have contacts, more direct contacts. He has
had a problem too, that in public he couldn't say anything, and whenever
he was in New York he was boxed in.ż

((I don't want to start a debate but you say that the -- when are you
going to get rid of the Red regime-- this is the a reflection of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 227

Similarly, isn't sensitivity that you spoke about. Zsaźzzzeażży the Cuban population sensitized in such fashion as to come up with a comparably provocative and xxd dialogue-ending remark.))

It seems a little bit less. One of the problems is that of Cubad immigration. There isn't in Cuba, to the best of my knowledge, a broad anti-Americanism. Always in even in Fidel's speeches, he makes a distinction between the American government and the American people. Than There is a very open nuance about the Cuban counter-revolutionaries. They may be counter-revolutionaries but they also happen to be uncles, cousins, nephews, and almost everybody has some one among them, from Fidel on down.

((The exiles in Miami and elsewhere))

That's right. They are relatives. Just as the treatment for instance of the people at the Bay of Pigs- which was extraordinary. In many countries they would have been in our country, they would have taken them all out and shot them. There they weren't albowed to beat them; they said they "had been misled" and so forth. This wasn't really for propaganda, this was a feeling. I have seen it happen over and over again

They might shoot someone. They did, they shot three people, a Batista sergeant and some others. It was an incredible gaffe thx*xxxxwid to include among these people an old Batista torturer. He was shot and protected.

I have been told by people who have been there recently that you have only to say that you are an American to get a sympathetic audience around you immediately. People want to discuss with you, why did they do this, that. You see they can hear Miani. They listen to the American radio all the time, and they listen to radio SWAN. I heard Radio SWAN in Cuba. Radio SWAN MASxA was a CIA radio operated off of Swan Island off of Nicaragua and island which is claimed by Nicaragua but in actual fact is possessed by the United States (laughing). The Nicaraguans have never been able to persuade us to leave. We just have some sailors on it. They built this enormous sadio which broadcast to Cuba. It wasn't an official radio. It was called Radio SWAN. It was a CIA operation. It was so crude, it was really pathetic, the type of thing-- people are starving, that type of thing. Now this was directed at Cuba and when you have propaganda like that - it is very little that can be confirmed. You say people are starving, and they are able to go out andbuy something. There was a lot of racist material in there about Congolese troops stationed in Central Cuba. There were no Congolese troops. This short of attitude came out later. During the time of the Bay of Pigs operation thef

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 228

going to be Machiavellian, my God you don't do it like that, you know. The best propaganda is the one that comes closest to the truth, that just slightly goes off, you don't have to push the point.

In any case, I do feel that there are an enormous number of people in Cuba and inside of the government, particularly among the old 26th of July Kaxanaxx people, who would be - they don't want to make a capitulation to the United States. They want an independent government. They would like trade. They would like to get out of the dependence on the Soviet Union such as it is. They have managed to keep from being swallowed up by the Russians just by enormous effort on their part.

Do you think that both sides have committed themselves so far that it is impossible to have any kind of rapprochement or normalization of relations without a feeling that one side or the other or both, had been forced to capitulate? I don't think it's true any more. To a certain extent recent months brought a sort of cooling down in Cuban'-American relations, though there have been continued charges about Venezuela, and it is certainly true that the Cubans were encouraging the Venezuelan FALN. They certainly gave financial support not so much in the way of arms, I think, but money, and in a guerrilla campaign you get your arms anyway from the police and the army, from the army that'ssurrounds you. That's the easiest way.

I have the feeling, nevertheless, that the Cubans are somewhat disappointed, disillusioned, about their ability to agitate these revolutionary groups elsewhere in Latin America, their ability to carry any effective revolution, just as the Alliance of for Progress has proved to be a great disappointment to many people in Washington so has the Cuban open solidarity with other, almost any, revolutionary movement in Latin America, proved a disappointment.

On the other hand, the Cubans are not going to issue a statement saying that we will not export revolution. Certainly the first yearsof the (Cuban) revolution, they did some extremely insane things, with expedition to Haiti, expedition to Santo Domingo, expedition to Panama, remember, and they had to send people in to Panama to get them to surrender. The people in Santo Domingo were just slaughtered. In Haiti they were slaugtered also.

A messy situation. On the other hand, every once in a while Duvalier makes overtures. He's not beyond anything.

SUBJECT LCHARVEST/KUDESK/MHSFAWN Revolution Mailing List

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1.  Transmitted herewith is one copy of the cards that constitute the mailing list for Revolution. These were borrowed from Richard GIBSON and copied in the station. GIBSON's wife, who compiled the cards and was responsible for distribution of Revolution (and to whom, therefore, they more properly belong) is not aware that GIBSON has "loaned" the cards out. They were returned to GIBSON's flat the same day he brought them in for copying.

2.  We have not made any attempt to count them. There are several thousand. A few comments will be in order about some of the marks and notations that appear on the cards.

3.  One general category is "Promotional". The first bunch of sheets - about twenty, it appears - are in this category. They are marked "Promotional" or "PR". These were sent out gratis either to induce publicity, or to encourage new subscribers, or to make friends happy. (Presumably, Robert WILLIAMS and several others are in this category).

4.  Thereafter, the cards run in categories of one sort or another, with given countries generally lumped together. Those where the address was obviously stapled onto a card are some of those that were taken from Frene GINWALA's Spearhead mailing list. Some are marked "ex-Spearhead"; which means that the name came from the Spearhead list, and the person subsequently subscribed on his own, after a little promotional treatment.

5.  The coded symbols, unfortunately, GIBSON could not explain, since this was his wife's territory, rather than his own. The first set of letters obviously refers to the country (e.g.,UK/). Other numbers and letters are not clear. The name that appears apart from the name of the subscriber usually indicates who arranged the subscription (this may be an agent, or something like a gift subscription). For instance, S. V. LEE is Sheldon LEE, who handles

some subscriptions. Expiration dates are obvious. "Private"
merely means that someone ordered a subscription directly,
himself, rather than through an agency.

6. Any further questions relating to the list can be
   included in any subsequent contacts with GIBSON: if they merit
   inclusion, and if it seems likely that he will know the answers.

7. We note that the list's accuracy cannot be guaranteed,
   especially after the time when the GIBSON's parted ways with
   Jacques VERGES.

8. At some time, the SMOOTHERS may ask us for this list.
   We would appreciate being advised as to whether Headquarters
   would like us to acknowledge having it.

(laughing) That's right. I think that going into that would tale a long time and I'm not that it's also very hard to say,
making contacts with the Africans with the Chinese, You say look, we need a car, for political work. The Chinese say turn up a car take your car. If the US embassy turned up a car, they would say take a car from the US Embassy. It doesn't make them any more American agents, It makes then Chinese agents. It's just a matter of who can produce. Africa is full of poor people. Just as the Negro community in the United States is full of poor people. Poor people don't have any sense of loyalty in the ordinary sense of the word. They have a sense of loyalty to their poverty, and colonial experience also mixed in nation-hood. the national sense is extremely weak, They see things in terms of Western Nigeria, former colonial power, that's all.

((Holden Roberto is down here. You talked about him. I know about him))

You ought to know him better than I do. (laughing) I met him only once and that was in New York. I had a long discussion with him about what 1 to 3 in the morning, and he was terribly afraid that somebody would think he was a Communist. I tried to assure him I didn't think he was a Communist no matter what (laughing).

((Did he have anything to do with the magazine))

None, because the magazine, while Verges was there in Algiers, and up until Viriato da Cruz changed his position, the magazine when was following the MPLA and only changed about with/Viriato changed from the MPLA to the UPA.

Holden went to China and I suppose he give the Chinese some guarantees but I don't know.

((Mario d'Andrade))

He is the active Secretary - I don't know his official title- of the MPLA, and represents another tendency different from Dr. Neto is the President. He had contacts with *Revolution* and with Viriato da Cruz. He sought to get Viriato to come back to the MPLA. He is a poet also. They are all poets. They are all former students in Portugal. The last time he came through Paris, he saw. After Viriato published his articles, in *Revolution*, he asked for the right of reply which was granted by Verges but he never wrote the article. He could be said to be Neto much more pro-Soviet than pro- (Chinese) if anything. I think that Andrade

SUBJECT DEBRIEFING OF RICHARD T. GIBSON
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
RE: ORLA - 42,410, 26 January 1965

1. On 11 February KUBARK Staff Agent Errol S. KULPA, who had contact with GIBSON in 1363-64, listened to reference tape and made the following comments, which may be helpful to Katzenbach. KULPA felt that the GIBSON that he was hearing on the tape had indeed changed rather radically since the last time KULPA had any contact with him or the Revolution. KULPA remembers GIBSON as anti-white and probably (because of this racial orientation) anti-U.S. KULPA is therefore quite suspicious of GIBSON's motivations and advises that extreme precaution be taken in the handling of GIBSON.

2. KULPÅ's view of Gibson's motivations:

KULPA has strenuous doubts as to any idealogical motivation on the part of GIBSON. He recognizes the obvious monetary motivation and feels that this probably plays a large part in the man's being willing to talk to ODYOKE. Another very possible motivation is GIBSON's disaffection with VERGES. Parenthetically, KULPA added that in Algiers and probably in Paris, GIBSON was really nothing more than a name that VERGES wanted on the masthead. GIBSON's primary duties as "editor" were probably in the area of translation. In light of this KULPA feels that perhaps some legitimate information of value can be obtained in the area of the Revolution. Again, paren- thetically, it might be noted that KULPA felt that GIBSON was not as "idedistic" as his wife. Where GIBSON might adhere to the aspects of Marxism-Leninism that called for revolutionary change (probably because of his dissatisfaction with a world in which the black man had to endure a certain amount of discrimination), he is not a strict doctrinaire in any of his beliefs. On the other hand, KULPA pointed out that GIBSON's wife (who by the way is a Central European by birth-- not British) is idealistic in the sense that she feels her brand of leftism must be internally and idealogically consistent. (This is why she objected to GIBSON's writing for Encounter and why she probably would get upset if she knew exactly what type of game her husband was currently playing with ODYOKE.)

Debriefing of hichart T. Gibson-irausalitas oi Requirements

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:

Ref: OELA - 42,410, 26 January 1965

1. Forwarded as enclosure are requirements for the debriefing of Subject. Together with the requirements is a KUDESK narrative on VERGES-ANDERSSON-Revolution complex for the background information of Katzenbach. Further background on Revolution can be found, if you have not already done so, in the following dispatches:

2. We have not yet had time to review the tape of your first session with Subject forwarded with Reference, nor do we expect to get a transcription completed in time to reach you by 15 February. The list of names attached to Reference indicate considerable knowledgeability on the part of Subject as well a tendency to pour out his knowledge in a sort of stream of consciousness style. We fear that, if given the opportunity, Subject will take the bit in his teeth and as much money as he can in his hot little hands and be off and running. To prevent this we would like to suggest that the debriefing be set up on a tightly organized, businesslike basis. It would probably be advisable to write up the terms in a Letter of Agreement contract for Subject's signature before getting started, making sure to include a paragraph in which ODYOKE's obligations and promises are limited to the terms specifically enumerated in the document. We think that any meaningful debriefing will take 3-5 days, and there is good reason to believe that Subject will have information of sufficient interest to justify this expenditure of Case Officer time. We do not foresee any long range operational relationship with Subject. While we look at the debriefing as basically a cne-shot proposition there will probably be follow-up questions and, perhaps, specific action requests, requiring a later contact. Therefore, the communication channel to Subject should be left open on a "don't call us, we'll call you" basis.

3. In line with the need to put the debriefing on a businesslike
   (rather than a "flexible") basis, it might be a good idea to start
   by getting Subject to supply a personal history statement from the
   time of his first entry into leftist political movements to the
   present day. (This can be presented to Subject as a basis for us
   to formulate meaningful questions, not as any sort of personal
   "confession" on his part.) In addition to providing us with a
   check on his veracity, this will set the stage for a debriefing
   conducted on KUBARK's terms, not Subject's. It is important that
   it be made clear to Subject at the outset that we want *facts*, not
   speculation, commentary and analysis.

4. Please charge payments to Subject for the debriefing to
   Acct. Nr. 5137 - 1468 (Hqs. LCHARVEST OOA). Three hundred dollars
   for the initial 2½ hours talk with Subject is on the steep side.
   We were thinking in terms of $700 for five days debriefing with a
   bonus for a copy of the Revolution mailing list.

Narrative

Hils ANDERSSON, Swedish-born resident of Switzerland, heads a printing and publishing establishment ("Editions la Cite") in Lausanne, said to have been set up in 1957 for the printing and distributing of Chinese literature. (This ties in with other information that the firm was established in Switzerland during the Algerian war in order to publish printed matter banned in France.) Since 1963 the firm had been responsible for the English-language edition of *Revolution*, but in 1964 the printing of the English-language edition was transferred to Paris where *Revolution*'s main office is located. Swiss authorities had ordered ANDERSSON to cease publication of *Revolution*.

Revolution has had e complicated history. It is descended from *African Revolution* which first appeared in early 1963) in Algeria. Its editor, Jacques VERGES, is a former member of the French CP who broke with that party over the Algerian question, After VERGES, who briefly headed *African Revolution*, had a falling out with Algerian officials later in 1963, and left that country, he began a new publication in Switzerland using the facilities of the already established ANDERSSON firm. His new publication was called *Revolution*, sometimes known as *Revolution- Asie, latin America, Africa*. (The Algerians continue to publish *African Revolution*, which has no known connection with *Revolution*.) Initially both the English and French editions of *Revolution* were handled by ANDERSSON's firm, but the publishing operations of the French edition were very soon moved to Paris. Later the crinting, too, of the French edition was noved to Paris and only the English edition continued to be printed in Switzerland, VERGES and the main offices ware located in Paris."

Currently ANDERSSON is reported to publish *Octobre*, which is described as the organ of an organisation in Switzerland called the "Centre Lenine." Poth *Octobre* ani the *Centre Lenine* are said to be con- trolled by ANDERSSON, but very little information is available about either. The Centre has been described as a prepaganda arm of the Chinese Communists. There is some indication that they also have some connection with pro- Chinese dissident elements of the Spanish CP.

ANDERSSON's firm has also printed *Mundo Obrero Pevoluciocario* (MOR),

Although the English edition was crinted in Switzerland, its editorial office was also in Paris, headed by Richard GIRSCH, zerican negro. In late Yay and early June 1964 - when it was already apparent that Swiss authorities were going to close down the printing of *Revolution* in that country- GIBSON and Alexandre STRELKOFF went to The Netherlands seeking a fim there to print and distribute the English-language edition. It is not known why this effort vas made instead of transferring the printing directly to Paris as vas ultimately done.

the clandestine publication of a major pro-Chinese Spanish Coreunist
group called the Partido Comunista Revolucionario. In view of recent
reports that the MCR group may merge with one or more of the other
dissident Soanish Communist groups and that a joint organ will be
published, OR ray soon cease (or may already have ceased) publicatica.
What role ANDERSSON may play in new publication efforts of the pro-
Chinese Spanish dissidents is not kaowa.

The clandestine leadership of the Partido Comunista Revolucionario
has been located in lausanne, Switzerland, with some representation also
in Faris, but this group has apparently been receiving Chinese fizancial
assistance through the GRIPPA party in Belgium. Another mo-Chinese
Spanish group in Switzerland, the Oposicion Revolucionario Comunista
located in Geneva, has been publishing La Chisna. The Chista group
has reportedly been receiving funds from the Chinese Embassy in Pern.
Still another pro-Chinese Spanish group, the Agrupacion Comunista
Proletario, has been publishing Proletario, apparently from Paris bet
with some representation also reported in Belgium, While the group
has apparently had some contact with GRIFFA in Belgium, the Paris-based
group at one time at least appeared to be sponsored or aided by VERGES.
(CRIPFA has played an active role in trying to bring the different
Spanish dissident groups to a merger.)

The relationship between GRIPPA and ANDERSSON, GRIPPA and VERGES,
and VERGES and ANDERSSON is anything but clear. Some part of the
confusion may result from GRIPPA's driving efforts to function as the
director of Chinsse political operations in Furope, and to try to bring
the activities of others under his control.

a. GRIPPA was once reported to have said be had "lost
confidence in Revolution. Among his reported reasons was a
belief that VERGES wanted to be designated absolute leader in
Europe for the "revolutionary movement." Somewhat later GRIPFA
vas reported as saying that the Chinese were no longer subsidizing
Revolution and that it was now being backed by Faris editor
Francois FASPERO,

b. GRIFFA or his aides also appear to have been responsible
for stories circulating among some pro-Chinese European dissidents
that ANDERSSUF had been written off by the Chinese as a "Trotskyite."
GRIFPA has also been quoted as saying that the printing of MCR
vould be transferred from Lausanne to Belgium and to GRIFPA's own
publishing facility. (This is not known to have taken plar:.)

c. There have been reports, unexplained, that there is bad
blood between VERGZS and ANDERSSON.

JAGUAR report on GIBSON

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

REF: OBLA-42,410, 26 January 1965

1. Transmitted herewith are copies of JAGUAR's latest report on Richard Thomas GIBSON, which they compiled for us on being informed of our current operational interest in him. We expect that further information will be forthcoming since, as previously noted, they have instituted additional coverage of GIBSON's activities.

2. JAGUAR refer us to their previous reporting on GIBSON, which has been contained in their reports on Revolution. These include 031-36, 105 (29 August 1963); OBLA-40,542(15 April 1964); CELA-41,545 (10 September 1964); OKL-39,251 (24 September 1964); CELA-4,788(20 October 1964).

3. JAGUAR also point out that the paper contains information received from a number of secret sources, and they request that we not give it any distribution beyond KUBARK without consulting them, unless, of course, we have the information from other sources. JAGUAR have made a copy available to ODENVY London.

4. JAGUAR also informed us orally that the persons they suspect to have played a nost prominent role in the 1963 charges of GIBSON'S CIA affiliation - the two persons referred to in para 3 of their paper - were Rosalynd AINSLIE and Patricia KeGOWAN. JAGUAR gave us this information informally and off the record. It is interesting to note that, in Ref, GIBSON agreed that AIESLIE was one but made no mention of KOGOWAN.

5. GIBSCH spoke of the affair of JAGUAR's para 3 (a) at some length, giving a rather different interpretation, however. Paras 3 (b), (c), and (d) are rather more speculative.

6. JAGUAR also told us, informally, that some of their information on GIBSON, as contained herein, derives from some of his correspondence. The implication is not that JAGUAR has been reading GIBSON's mail, but that, by intercepts or penetrations, they have been reading the mail of some of the

persons to whom he has written - or, of course, mail of other persons, in which mention is made of GIBSON.

7. As a belated footnote to Ref, we learn that JAGUAR had previously identified the Swiss printer as *Nile ANDERSON* (see CHI-39,251, 24 September 1964).

8. JAGUAR informed us on 26 January that GIBSON had requested (prior to 23 January) a one-month extension of his residence permit, to enable him to make his proposed European trip and return to the U.K. The extension was granted without demur.

Richard Thomas GIBSON
Born: Los Angeles on 13.5.31
Address: 30, Stockleigh Hall,
Prince Albert Road, London, N.W.8.

GIBSON has been connected with the pro-Chinese Communist publication "Revolution" and its predecessor, "African Revolution", at least since April, 1963. He made available the following information about himself as part of a publicity campaign planned for "African Revolution" in the first half of 1963:-

1951-52: worked in Rome for the Mediterranean News
Bureau of the "Christian Science Monitor";

1955-58: editor with the English language service of
"Agence France Presse" in Paris;

1958: arrested by the French authorities because of
his work for the Algerian National Liberation
Front;

1959-60: returned to the U.S.A. and employed by the
C.B.S. News in New York until dismissed because
of his pro-Cuban activities;
awarded a C.B.S. fellowship in African Studies
at Columbia University;

1960-September, 1962: Executive Secretary of the "Fair Play for Cuba"
Committee in the U.S.A.

2. In 1963, GIBSON lived in Lausanne, where "African Revolution" and subsequently the English edition of "Revolution" were printed, but he paid frequent visits to "Revolution's" Paris office until the end of the year when "Revolution" was banned in Switzerland and he was refused permission to continue to live there. He then settled in Paris where, according to one report, he and his wife lived in "quite a luxurious flat". It would, however, be wrong to infer from this that GIBSON's means enabled him to enjoy high living standards, as another source subsequently reported that he had not paid any rent for the flat from May to October, 1964.

3. As far back as August, 1963, there were rumours in Communist circles in London that GIBSON was an American agent and that he had provided United States Intelligence with the names of certain unidentified United States negroes in accordance with a brief received from the Americans. Information from a well-placed source suggests that these rumours may have originated from the jealous reactions of two persons, connected with "Revolution", whose aspirations with the publication were cut short when GIBSON became Editor of the English edition. However, by mid-1964, VERGES, the Editorial Director of "Revolution", was claiming that complaints about GIBS...'s activities had been received not only from London, but also from Cuba, American negroes in New York and a relative of GIBSON's who was working for the magazine "Spark" in Ghana. As a result, GIBSON was dismissed from the editorial staff of "Revolution". Charges made against him include the following-

/(a) ...

CS COPY

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 256

-2-

(a) denouncing, in 1958, an unidentified negro, possibly a
Communist, who was expelled from France;

(b) informing the publication's contacts in China that
"Revolution" was disintegrating;

(o) providing "Newsweek" and the "New York Herald Tribune"
with information in an attempt to discredit "Revolution";

(d) connections with the C.I.A.

Although GIBSON has denied the charges made against him, he realises that they have stuck and that it will be some years before he will be acceptable to any left wing organisation.

4. Having failed to find employment in Paris after leaving "Revolution" in July, 1964, GIBSON went to the United Kingdom on 7th October and was joined later by his British wife, Joy Marjorie, and his two children. He hoped to find work in London, but at the end of November, he was still without a job and dependent on his wife's family, who were paying the rent of his flat at 30, Stockleigh Hall, Prince Albert Road, London, N.W.8. It is now known whether GIBSON has been able to find employment.

5. Nothing is known at present about GIBSON's contacts in the United Kingdom. Although during the time he worked for "Revolution" he was in touch with members of the pro-Chinese Communist splinter group in the United Kingdom - the Committee to Defeat Revisionism, for Communist Unity - it is not known whether he has resumed contact. It has been reported that he still keeps in touch with the coloured South African journalist, Lionel MORRISON, who is employed by the Chinese-backed Afro-Asian Journalists' Association (A.A.J.A.) in Djakarta.

Comment:

Para. 5: "Afro-Asian Journalist", no. 4, dated July, 1964, and published by the A.A.J.A., contains an article "Two Revolutionary Journals" by MORRISON, the journals being "Revolution" and "Spark".

FROM: Chief of Station, London

SUBJECT: KUDESK/LCHARVEST/REVOLUTION
Tape of Interview with Richard Thomas GIBSON

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:

REF: LOND 5706, 21 January 1965

1.  Attached is the tape of the interview with GIBSON, recorded in an Embassy office, using a Uher 4000 Report - 5 recorder, recording at a speed of 15/16 feet per minute. The interviewer used the alias of Earl Wilson. Gibson arrived at 1745 and departed at about 2030.

2.  We are not attempting to summarise or analyse GIBSON's comments in this dispatch. The tape provides a much more revealing picture than our subjective comments could. A few notes, however, appear to be in order.

3.  Speaking of his departure, GIBSON said he planned to leave London on 24 or 25 January. As of noon 24 January, at least, he was still in London because I saw him walking on St. John's Wood High Street. (A potential problem exists here: GIBSON and I live within a few blocks of one another and not infrequently ride the same bus line. This problem can only be met when it manifests itself.) JAGUAR, incidentally, has alerted its immigration contacts (prior to our meeting with GIBSCN) and requested that his name be put on a watch list. They said that they would inform us if they learn that he has left the country. We have not yet heard that he has left.)

4.  GIBSON was given money amounting to $300. Under the circumstances of his plans, as he expressed them, it seemed reasonable to do so, to ensure, at least partially, that he would come back to talk more. He was more than willing to take the money and raised the initial suggestion of $200 to $300 or $400. His obvious shift in his line regarding dollars (as opposed to pounds) is further indicative of his willingness to get what he could.

5.  The considerable number of names mentioned by GIBSON makes the transcription of the notes a sizable chore, and in order to lessen this burden a listing has been compiled of almost all of the names, in the order in which they appear in the tape, with the exception of VEROES and the Free Play for Cuba Committee, CBS and a few others. The names appear only one time each on the list, although many of them crop up repeatedly in the tape.

A few of the phrases that do not appear too clearly on the tape are included on the list. Occasionally the names are written phonetically, indicated by (ph.).

6. GIBSON's offer of a photograph of VERGES was not accepted, on the assumption that KUBARK already has a photo. If this is not the case, let us know, and we will include that in our requirements for a subsequent meeting.

7. The Afro-Asian Journalists Association man is apparently Lionel MORRISCH. He is also referred to as the "man from Djakarta". (See LOND 5575 of 12 January 1965.)

8. The reference to the Cultural Attache of the Cuban Embassy corroborates (rather, is corroborated by) the material referred to in para 4 of LOND 5337 (22 December 1965). We are not fully aware of the Cuban's political orientation, however,

9. In reviewing the tape, it will become apparent that the arrangements with GIBSON were left fairly flexible for the future. It would appear, from his responses, that a longer range relationship with him could, in fact, be established if, after thorough review of his materials, that seems necessary or desirable.

10. We will expect, in addition to the requirements that have been promised, that Headquarters will advise us on their desire to arrange for the one-shot approach previously suggested by Headquarters, or a different arrangement. We are unable to assess the validity or worth of all the comments he made. Our impression, however, is that he is reasonably knowledgeable of a number of fields of interest to us. We also suspect that in some areas his knowledge is quite superficial. His access to various areas of potential interest may be partially proved by his trip around Europe and should be a useful indication of how we may be interested in playing him. The possibility of his being a provocation has not been overlooked, of course, and we welcome Headquarters' comments on this score as well.

11. We would also appreciate further comments on various personalities, with whom we are not familiar - "Anderson" is the most obvious in this category.

12. Headquarters is requested to provide us with a transcription of this tape, as well as the promised requirements, prior to 15 February. ODENVY should also be provided with as much of the material as is of interest to them, and a copy of that material should be given to us to pass to the ODENVY office here. We are also obliged to pass to JAGUAR such elements of this material as is of legitimate concern to them. In this case, we would suggest that this be interpreted rather liberally and Headquarters-prepared copy be forwarded along with the other items listed above. (Note that JAGUAR has been quite cooperative while we have been approaching this case, and their recent run-down on GIBSON is being pouched almost simultaneously with this dispatch.)

REFERENCE: PARI 8052

NOTE: The following round-up and commentary on Iden A had been drafted before PAL? 3017 of 6 January 1965 and later traffic presented tise case in a somewhat different light. He forward the following anyway, as some of the background and suggestions still seer pertinent. Several questions raised below have now been resolved, notably the alleg- ation of an Iden A/UBARK link (explained by the ODEVY letter of 1 December 1964, not available when the following was written). Cories of recent PALP correspondence on Iden A, passed to us on 13 January 1965, are attached as Attaciment 3, USC.

1. Upon receiving the memorandum cited in the reference, we requested Further details from UDOUD, stressing our interest in the report that CPUSA nembers had given IDEN C documents which showed Di A belonged to "the services of KUBARK". D/5986 of 30 December 1964, U3OUND's answer to our query, merely reiterates that the UNBOUND source, a good one, based the report on a "coami- cation of documents" by American Comunists to DC, which supposedly established that IDEN A belonged to KUBARK; UNBOUND states that the source is not in a position to identify the persons in question. UNBOUND's reply suggests the information might have come from an audio operation; we might mention here that IDEN A has appeared occasionally on UNPAY, but never in an informative way. A mail intercept might also be the source of UNBOUND's report, or it may have come from a third service (conceivably JAGUAR or SMOTH).

2. Our continuing preoccupation with the IDEN A question is three-fold: (a) his expulsion from ID: 8 (and thus from acceptance by pro-Peiping groups) opens the door for his possible recruitment; (b) we would like to determine whether his ouster was engineered by personal enemies or whether he actually did work for an intelligence service, and which one; (c) as Peiping regards the USA as its primary target, the Chinese can be expected to continue prop- aganda attacks designed to create IDEN D tension and inflame the Afro/Asians

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

3.  ZUBARK's recruitment of IDE: A, or establishment of controlled access to him, could be extrecely useful in countering attempts to undermine the USA against the U.S.A. While domestic effects of such propaganda are properly handled by ODEVY, the manipulation of Li Ds to further Chinese propaganda abroad becomes AUBARK's concern.

of IDEN B plans in this regard, and he must now the names and locations of many persons involved. The most effective approach to A would probably be tarouzia an offer of money (his history indicates venality, and at present ne appears to be in financial difficulties), and oy stressing his chance to get even with IDEN C. The purity of IDECI A's Communism is open to question and should not impede recruitment; a more forziuable obstacle to a successful operation is his possible connection with a foreign intelligence service. This could be a western service but wight also be the Soviets, for now be would serve the dual purpose of causing trouble for the USA and at the save time reporting on the Chinese propaganda cachine; it is a watter of record that the Soviets view IDEE: 3 seriously. Muatever the basis for a BAR approach to IWA, it would require careful security planning, taking cognizance of his instability and his anom attitude toward ODYOKE as an IDEI D.

4.  "Revolution" has featured articles by three American Negroes, Richard GIBSON, Robert Franklyn WILLIAMS, and Malcolm X, all obviously intended to prejudice readers against the USA on ground of racial injustice, all three men are or have been involved with foreign Communists: GIBSON and WILLLEAS with the Chinese and the Cubans, notably, and Halcoln Ä with the Chinese and various African Comunists (actual or crypto). The "New York herald Tribune" of 4 January 1965 reported Lalcolm's statement that he hopes to "internationalize" the American Negro problem, and that he claims to have influenced severai African governments to make representations in the U... against the Usa's treatment of its Negroes. This may be a foretaste of Cainese plans for foreiga exploitation of this issue; Malcolm was interviewed by "Revolution" in Cairo, which has since proved its enthusiastic anti-Americanisa.

5.  OFP-14693 reports that Philip BART, a pro-Soviet official of the CPUSA, stted in December 1964 that the CPUSA has positive proof that four members of their Chinese faction are being paid by the Chinese Coxarists. (It is perhaps relevant tomte here that the advent of "Revolution" was nailed by letters to the Editor from American leftists, including the FPCC; according to OFP-37875, Vincent T. LEE of "All Worlds Publications" in New York City takes subscriptions for Revolution"). It is hard to say where Will A enters into the clouded picture of American Communist partisanship in the Sino/Soviet rift, but in view of his shifting allegiances he may have divulged to pro-Soviet CPUSA members, or to the Soviets themselves, information on Chinese subversion in the USA. The October 1964 issue of "Liammer & Steel Newsletter" is cited by the Radio Free Europe research bulletin of November 1964 in the latter's review of pro-Chinese factions anong Western Commist Parties; RFE research describes "Hammer & Steel" as a monthly produced in Boston by a small american faction. (Portions of the RFE research bulletin with its citations from "Hammer & Steel" are attached as Attachment 1). The marked paragraph from "Hammer & Steel" aits at the idea of white nations' inherent superiority; this is consistent with China's claim of a bond among the colored peoples of the world, which persits such effective anti-Soviet propaganda as the over of "Revolution" for Hay 1964, which shows KHRUSHCHEV saying, "se, the whites...".

6.  IDEN C's denunciation of IDEN A may have been at least partially caused by suspicion he was trying to gain control of IDEN E; it will be recalled that very shortly before his ouster, IDEN A was in iiolland negotiating for that type of printing equipment (MAGU 6137 and OHA 28818). He is now living in London; he has presumably been obliged to find work there (uniess he actually is on an intelligence payroll), and he may have landed with some leftist publishing outfit or even with the CPUK, which is sufficiently divided to afford room for his current views, whatever they may be. In addition to IDEN A's potential for reporting on Chinese propaganda efforts, his uses as a penetration of British or other European Communist publishing circles are obvious.

7. UNBOUND reported that American Communists had allegedly given IDEN C documents showing IDEI A worked for KUBAK. One explanation of this allegation may lie in IDEN A's visit to the Azerican Enbassy, Paris, in late 1963, at the request of lir. John G. COSSETT, then Acting Consul General. GOSSETT was interested in any information ne might have on possible connections between IDEN F, with which IDEN A had been connected, and President Kennedy's assassination. (a copy of GOSSETT's Memorandum of Conversation is attached under separate cover as Attachment 2; his appraisals of LD A and his reservations concerning his motives are interesting). IDEN A and GOSSETT had a far-ranging talk, including what may have been a tentative feeler by IDE: A for ODYOKE employment. It seems likely that ID! à would have reported an American Embassy inquiry to his friends in IDEN F, and he may even have mentioned tie possibility of future "work" for ODYOKE, which could have led to eventual allegations that he had been recruited by KUZARK. This is of course speculation, but IDEN A's flexible loyalties and liking for money are surely known to his colleagues, and, if he had already aroused antagonism among them, the bassy visit would serve as a peg for sincere or expedient denunciation.

8. We can shed no light on the allegation that IDEN Gis a KUBARKER (LOND 5337). Our only trace is OELA 39346, stating he is IDEX I. de are not clear as to the relationship between IDEN A, IDEN G, and IDEN I, also mentioned in OELA 39346, which states size "appears to be" IDEN A's wife. According to ODENVY Paris, however, IDEN A is married to IDEN J. OEL 39251 of September 1964 reported that A and his wife (unnamed) had successfully sued IDEI B for salary arrears; the fact that the wife was also employed recalls the IDEJ I professional status, which might make her operationally significant whether or not she is married to IDEN A.

### November 17, 1964

One of the most violent reactions came from the heartland of capitalism, from the small American faction which produces the monthly *Hammer & Steel Newsletter* in Boston. The October issue of the mimeographed bulletin vengefully gives a list of eight reasons why Khrushchev fell -- each one a vindictive crow of triumph, and many attacking not only Khrushchev but basic Soviet policies such as "the distortion of peaceful coexistence." Points 2, 3 and 8 will serve as illustrations:

2. His German policy -- Khrushchev sought to ingratiate himself with West Germany. He was obviously ready to sell out the German Democratic Republic...

3. The declining influence of the CPSU among the Socialist countries and the Communist Parties. The proposed Moscow gathering was shaping up as a conference of only those Party leaders ready to openly serve U.S. imperialist aggression against the national liberation struggles. For example, Asian supporters of Khrushchev could have gathered in a telephone booth.

8. The nuclear success of People's China. Khrushchev had maintained that nuclear power was the exclusive responsibility of revisionists and imperialists of white nations. Khrushchev's great power chauvinism was blown sky high in Sinkiang Province.

Although there is no evidence that the politically insignificant *Hammer & Steel* group enjoys any direct support from the Chinese (as the Russians alleged in their "Open Letter" of July 14, 1963), it has always offered its allegiance to Peking in the most extreme form. This is expressed again in the claim that "Khrushchev's failure to recognize the contradiction between the oppressed peoples and imperialism as the focal contradiction of our time resulted in blindness concerning the leading role of the Chinese Party."[^8] This is a claim that the Chinese themselves would not want to make, expecially at this juncture.

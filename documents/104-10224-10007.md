MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT : Consultant Status for -

James Angleton
Raymond G. Rocca
William J. Hood
Newton S. Miler

REFERENCE : HR 20-52 and HHB 20-8

1. Action Requested:

This memorandum requests the Director to approve the use of Messrs Angleton, Rocca, Hood and Miler as Agency Consultants for the period 1 April - 30 September 1975.

2. Background:

a. All four officers retired under the CIARDS system 31 December 1974 and are currently contract employees, contracts to expire 30 March 1975.

b. It is proposed that Subjects' services be retained under consultant status on an intermittent, as-needed basis as determined by Acting Chief, CI Operations, Mr. George T. Kalaris. In view of the long and unique experience of these officers in counter-intelligence, not duplicated in any other personnel, the new Acting Chief, CI Operations will want to have available the benefit of their advice and counsel during the next few months.

CONFIDENTIAL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

c. Payment for services as consultant for the period 1 April - 30 September 1975 shall be as follows: in each case the total allowable is one half or less of the difference between 90 percent of their former salaries and their current annuities;

- Mr. Angleton: at a fee of $138.48 per day not to exceed $6,000 for the period;

- Mr. Rocca: at a fee of $138.48 per day not to exceed $3,700 for the period;

- Mr. Hood: at a fee of $138.48 per day not to exceed $3,300 for the period;

- Mr. Miler: at a fee of $138.48 per day not to exceed $5,200 for the period.

3. Positions:

a. It is the position of CI Operations that there is a need for Subjects' services which cannot be met from on-board personnel. Coordination with Domestic Collection Division is not pertinent and has not been effected. Clearance from the Office of Security has been received.

b. The Office of Personnel affirms that on the basis of the information supplied above, this request appears to meet the policy requirements of HR 20-52, Consultants. It accordingly recommends that this request be approved.

c. The Office of General Counsel has reviewed this proposal and has found no evidence of conflict of interest.

Dear Scotty:

On the occasion of retirement, it has been the custom to seni a letter to our employees in appreciation for their services. While your retirement has been stretched a bit by your willingness to help us on the transition to your successor, I do not want the occasion to pass without this recognition.

I sincerely regret the publicity which surrounded your retirement and the circumstances under which it occurred. These should not, however, conceal the fact that you have made a real contribution to your country, to this Agency, and to the intelligence profession in your many years of service. We do appreciate this contribution and wish you the best of satisfaction and enjoyment in the years ahead.

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Service
Career Service Board

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion -
Newton Scott MILER

1. This is a recommendation for the promotion for Mr. Miler from Grade GS-6 to GS-17. Details on career background and per- formance, elaborated in earlier promotions, will not be repeated.

2. Mr. Miler, in the last 18 months, has taken over as Chief of the Operational Group of the CI Staff. He has done an outstanding job in directing the performance of this component. Concurrently, he has implemented significant operational and reporting activity in several sensitive Staff undertakings. He has maintained mutually beneficial exchanges on CI matters with the Federal Bureau of Inves- tigation, with the Department of State, and with other components of the Agency responsible for security matters. The range, quality, as well as the quantity, of Mr. Miler's work, are in the highest profes- sional tradition of the Clandestine Service.

3. Mr. Miler supervises as Group Chief a Deputy and six senior officers, six other officers and six support personnel. His unit covers the whole range of incoming counterintelligence corres- pondence. The problems on which he and individuals under his direct supervision are called upon daily to render policy assistance and opera- tional guidance include - to name the principal ones - double agent cases, penetrations, audio operations, surveillances, operational and personal security flaps, presidential protection, and divisional and branch program review and planning. Mr. Miler has galvanized the whole effort along these lines and has given creative, affirmative leadership in finding solutions as well as in delineating problems.

4. Mr. Miler's performance overall has been outstanding. Furthermore, we regard him as an individual with outstanding potential for counterintelligence in the Agency and in the U.S. intelligence community. We believe Mr. Miler's performance as Operational Group Chief warrants the earliest consideration for promotion to the Grade of GS-17.

2. I would like to add that I thoroughly enjoyed working with each and every member of the Seminar. I am sure you will agree that the experience was interesting and valuable. The congeniality, dedication, and general unanimity of our group on all the major issues were impressive.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Warren Dean
Mr. Constantine Broutsas
SUBJECT: Clandestine Service Senior Seminar

1. I have been some time getting around to expressing my appreciation to you and through you to the other officers who participated in the Senior Seminar. Maybe it is just as well because, as you probably are aware, a number of the findings of the Senior Seminar have been, in one form or another, acted upon. In some of the cases, action that was already underway was accelerated. In others, the Seminar produced useful insights on the basis of which action was taken.

2. I know that it was a considerable labor for you but I would like you to be aware of the fact that I and the other officers in the Clandestine Service involved in the matters dealt with by the Seminar have been helped greatly by its several findings.

3. It is probable that we will want to do another running of the Seminar later this year. If so, I know that we will benefit from the excellent pilot run which you conducted.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion -
Newton Scott MILER

1. This is a recommendation for promotion for Mr. Miler from Grade GS-15 to GS-16.

2. The careerf this officer has been notably marked through- out with relatively important responsibilities for his age. His youth, intense drive, initiative, self-assurance, capacity for work, natural talent for determining the objectives, recognizing the problem, organization of the work to be done, administering and supervising the effort, have long been evident to those for and with whom he has worked. Years of service during which he has steadily matured has resulted in a recognition, by supervisors and subordinate fellow- workers alike of his unusually wide experience, proven soundness of judgement, organizational administrative and executive talent coupled with powers of expression both oral and written and demonstrated capacity for work. He is unquestionably a very outstanding officer.

3. Having entered on duty as a Code Clerk (GS-05) in October 1946 following an A. B. degree in Economics from Dartmouth College in a Navy V-12 Program, he was soon assigned to Shanghai where he remained a short period before a TDY assignment to open the communi - cations station in Seoul, Korea. He was assigned to Mukden and Antung, Manchuria from April 1947 to June 1949 where despite being barely 21 years of age and an official designation as Code Clerk as Grades GS-5/7, he conducted Agent operations into Korea, USSR and China. He handled liaison with Chinese officers and counter espionage cases with X-2 officers. His talents were recognized and after TDY training at Headquarters, he was assigned to Shanghai as an Intelligence Officer. There he performed as a Case Officer and engaged in stay beyond planning, supervision of other junior Case Officers, and assisted in the evacation of other CIA officers. Before he was 25 years of age, he established the station and served as Chief of Sapporo, Japan, for some 20 months (1949-51).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

-2-

4. He has successfully engaged in all types of operations -
   FI, CI, CA including PM and PW, but his principal talents have been in the Counter Intelligence, particularly Counter-Espionage field.
   His experience includes service as Chiefs of Station, Senior-Case Officer, Senior Staff Officer, and since September 1964, Deputy Chief of the Special Investigations Group of the CI Staff where he has had a major responsibility in the supervision of senior grade Counter Intelligence Officers as well as being personally and directly active in matters of agreat complexity and highest security considerations. In his service in that capacity he has demonstrated his outstanding abilities as a Counter Intelligence officer. He has carried a substantial portion of the work load of his office including supervision of both clerical and officer personnel, liaison with all elements of the Agency and other intelligence and security services of the government as appropriate. It is strongly recommended that he be promoted to Grade GS-16.

VIA: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJ: Expression of Appreciation (C)

CP-022Y30/
Ser: 0202P92
14 1757

1.  I hereby express my appreciation for service of the highest degree of excellence provided to my office during the past several months. You displayed professional competence that can only be described as exemplary in nature.

2.  It is unfortunate that the work on which you performed is of such a nature that it precludes a specific description herein, but that need not detract from the significance of this message of approbation. Of all the attributes displayed, the two most worthy of note are your use of imagination and persistence. Those two qualities enabled you to produce results which others had not been able to obtain. Near failure was transformed into success.

3.  Not to be ignored is your administrative ability. The marshaling of resources available to you and coordination of the efforts of your available personnel contributed materially to the degree and quantity of results obtained as well as the expeditious manner in which you proceeded. Also, selflessness was manifested by your willingness to ignore assigned working hours and press on as long as any hope existed for obtaining results.

4.  As you are aware, the results achieved by you have significance beyond the boundaries of the Navy. The full import cannot be completely evaluated at this time but it is known that the lives of many persons will be enriched by your efforts. it is regretted that all persons affected will not have the opportunity to express their thanks to you in person for the part you have played.

5.  On behalf of all persons who will benefit from your efforts, and on behalf of the Navy and myself, I again express my deepest appreciation and say to you a most hearty "well done".

6.  If it is consistent with the policy of your Agency, it is requested that a copy of this letter your official record.

1 February 1962

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion - Newton Scott Miler

1. It is recommended that Newton Scott Miler be promoted from his present grade of GS-14 to GS-15. Miler was assigned to the Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present position of Chief of Station, Addis Ababa, in September 1961. He has been in grade since 24 March 1957. In accepting his present assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a very complicated operational program requiring considerable reorientation and modification. In a short time he has been able to give purpose and direction to operations which previously had been the subject of considerable controversy within DD/P. It is worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost entirely new team, few of whom had any previous experience in African operations.

2. Under normal circumstances, the Supervisor would be inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the individual. It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception to this rule. Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division, Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former Supervisor who is presently Deputy Chief, CI-CE Staff. This man had apparently felt so strongly about Miler's performance that he had suggested that Miler be the one man on the CI-CE staff who should be given a jump promotion to supergrade. If necessary a memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.

3. In addition to the above, the Supervisor has been associated with Miler in a professional relationship since 1946. The only gap in continuity was from the period 1956 to 1959. It is felt, therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's knowledge, ability, expérience, and potential bears weight.

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion of Newton Scott Miler

1. It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15.

2. During the two years that he has been an officer of the Operations Group of the CI Staff Mr. Miler has demonstrated an exceptional ability to interpret counterintelligence experience and practice in guiding operations in this area throughout the divisions of the DD/P. He has applied field experience gained in one area, combined with expertly informed Headquarters knowledge, to intricate and sensitive problems affecting U. S. security in a variety of geographic areas from the Far East to the Western Hemisphere and Europe with outstanding skill and sureness of judgment. He is aggressive, devotes long hours uncomplainingly to his tasks, and willingly contributes his guidance to officers of less experience. In personal relationships throughout the Clandestine Services he is admired, respected, and well-liked. His recommendations are eagerly sought and contribute in major fashion to increased effectiveness in carrying out the Cl mission. It is again strongly recommended that he be promoted to GS-15.

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion of Newton Scott Miler

1. It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15.

2. Since July 1958 Mr. Miler has been serving in the Soviet/ Satellite Branch of the CI Staff, Operations Division. In this position he has made a major contribution to the CI mission in his daily contacts with elements of the DD/P, Office of Training and Office of Security. Mr. Miler has excellent motivation, works long hours, readily accepts responsibility, and is highly effective in expressing his views both orally and in written form. He 18 resourceful, imaginative, and his operational judgment is superior. The frequency with which his professional advice is sought on an informal and personal basis is clear evidence of the high regard with which he is held by many individuals in the Clandestine Services. I strongly recommend him for promotion to the next higher grade.

James R. Hunt, Jr.
Chief, CI Operations

The Miler's record on this staff has been outstanding. I am sure that as a 15 he will be in demand for a field assignment (when his tour with this staff is over).

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OPERATIONS MISSION TO THAILAND

BANGKOK, THAILAND

April 9, 1958

Mr. Theo K. Hall
Chief, Public Safety Division
International Cooperation Administration
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Theo:

Re: Morton S. Miler

You have by now received our unclassified cable, FOICA 1408, advising of our acceptance of the resignation of Morton S. Miler who has served since December 25, 1956, as Chief of our Criminal Investigation Branch, Public Safety Division, USOM/T. It was with deep regret that I accepted the resignation since his departure on or about April 15, 1958, will be felt very keenly by both the Chief of the Division, Mr. Al DuBois, and myself.

Were it not for the pressing need of stateside medical attention for his wife and the fact that he should be with her during this period, I should have endeavored to prevail on him to take an alternative course of action. However, I am satisfied that there was no alternative and, hence, did accept the resignation effective April 15, 1958, it being noted that he is returning with his family to the States at his own expense.

This letter is to advise you of the facts leading to what would appear to be a sudden resignation. I also want to inform you that Miler's job performance here has, in my estimation, been of high order and can very easily be summarized by stating that he has performed most satisfactorily.

He has shown himself consistently to be tactful, considerate, and objective in his approach to his responsibilities and in the performance of his duties. I have at all times found that his judgment has been sound and mature. He has had warm and mutually satisfying relationship with his opposite numbers in the Thai police.

In furtherance of my statement of my confidence in him, I unhesitatingly designated him as acting Chief of our Public Safety Division during Mr. DuBois' absence on TDY in Washington for the period March 9 through April 5, 1958. I naturally had continuing personal

Mr. Theo. E. Hall

April 9, 1958

Contact with him during that period and observed his handling of himself in Executive Staff meetings. The various attributes which I cited above were clearly demonstrated during this period and, in fact, his performance during this period permits me to add that I am satisfied with his supervisory abilities.

I would have no hesitancy in recommending his reemployment by ICA if in the future the present family health situation is rectified.

Sincerely,

Thomas E. Haughton
Director

2. The subject has been in his present grade since 2 September 1951. During this period he was assigned to FRU/FEC, a case officer responsible for China Independent operations. The attached extract from FRU/FEC Dispatch outlines his duties and performances in this capacity. From March 1953 until the recent assignment to position described in Para 1, he has been acting as case officer in Headquarters, in charge of the STPHENIX project.

3. Mr. Kiler has been employed by the agency since 1946, during which time he has held various operational assignments both in and connected with China. He has developed an excellent background in this work. I have had the opportunity to become familiar with subject's work and consider that he has performed in an excellent manner. It is believed that ag is in a particularly well qualified operations officer, who is capable of successfully handling additional responsibilities and expandlar the scope of the China CE program.

Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO : CID

Thru : CGIS

FROM : Chief, FZ

DATE: 21 June 1948

SUBJECT: Promotion for Newton Scott Hiler

1. It is recommended that Mr. Newton Scott Hiler, Operations Officer, Mukden, China, ESD station, be promoted from CAF-7 to CAF-9. Mr. Hiler has been carrying out the functions and responsibilities of a CAF-9 officer for sometime. Records indicate that he was put in for promotion to CAF-7 August 1, 1947. Through delays caused by the long route from Lukden to Shanghai to Washington and by the reorganization of our promotion policy last winter, Mr. Hiler was not promoted until March 2, 1948.

2. He has performed with distinction as an operations officer in kukden, discovering an important, highly organized North anion political movement and making operational contact with it. He is in the U.S. on TDY at this time and he is greatly needed in the Lukden operational area to handle the operation referred to and then at Foiping when Lukden is no longer tenable.

3. Mr. Hiler feels that he has been in grade longer than the record shows because he was under the impression that action in the field set the date of the new grade. While this is in error, the field practice of giving a detailed notice of what would result from promotion in way of deductions and net pey tended generally to give employees the impression that promotion actions were definite long before they actually were. This paper work has since been stopped.

4. Because this operations officer has performed in an outstanding way, because he is twily needed in the field, and because he has great long term value to the organization and should be encouraged to develop, it is recommended that he be promoted to CAF-9 effective on the completion of his TDY when ready for return to China.

1. Discussion of the attached letter with Captain Howard Olson
   revelas that the following ESD #/H personnel are officially assigned
   to Communications Division but actually are doing and for some time have
   done no Communications work, and have no apparent interest in returning
   to Communications Division:

William S. Renehan - Services
Newton S. Miller - S.I.
Hugh R. Hoover - Services
Hugh R. Rodmond - S.I.

With the exception of Mr. Hoover, it is requested that transfer of the
personnel from Communications Division to the Sections where they are
now detailed, as indicated above, be formalized. Mr. Hoover is return-
ing to the United States in December. Such transfers are, according to
Captain Olson, acceptable to Colonel Moscrip, and will materially clari-
fy all personnel records.

2. If the proposed action is approved and the transfer is effected,
   it is requested that the Commanding Officer, ESD #/H be advised by pouch
   and that the other questions contained in Mr. Renehan's letter be answered.

1. For sometime now, we have had the papers in Washington for the reclassification of Mr. David E. West and Mr. Newton S. Miler.

2. Mr. David West is now stationed in Peiping and is ably performing the duties of a Junior Intelligence Officer. He is responsible for the Herial net which he has very successfully taken over from Mr. Frank Bosseau. In addition to this, he is also handling Olonade. It is hoped that his reclassification to a CAF-9 will be forthcoming.

3. Mr. Newton S. Miler, who is presently a CAF-5, is now stationed in Mukden and is performing the duties of a Junior Intelligence Officer. He is handling some North Korean operations from the Mukden station and is rapidly gaining experience. It is hoped that his reclassification to a CAF-7 will be acted upon.

4. It is requested that this headquarters be advised of any action taken by Washington regarding the reclassification of the above personnel.

Dear Scotty

Enclosed please find personal action papers for your promotion, Flense sign all four copies and return as soon as possible. Also, pleede prepare Job description in rough draft. I will have it edited and typed on the form.

A cable was sent to Washington asking for your transfer and promotion and an answer came back advising that it was impossible to transfer personnel from one branch to another in the field. The only place possible would be Waenington after you return to the States. They advised that all personnel in the field were assigned to SRO and that we were free to use personnel in whatever capacity we deemed best and that promotion papera bo pouched to Weanington for their consideration. This evidently is their policy because Renenan and noover nave botn received reises and are working for Services though originally sent out for Commo work by masnington.

You are doing a good jos, keep it up and don't forget to have a good time while Noll is there.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Newton Scott MILER (012773)
Reporting Period 1 february 1973 - 31 January 1974

1. Mr. Miler is a uniquely qualified senior officer who has specialized in counterintelligence. He has particular competence in background and management of sensitive counterintelligence cases of the Agency and of the other elements of the U.S. intelligence community. He is independent and aggressive in viewpoint, articulate, and personally deeply involved in the current conduct and future of counterintelligence as an operating function. He has excellent potential in the exercise of leadership and command in the counter- Intelligence specialty; in this respect I regard him as being without a peer among the younger officers in the 000.

2. He has been a most dependable worker and counselor in the reorganization that has taken place in the DDO over the past year. He has been an unfailing source of constructive, forward-looking suggestions and ideas, not only with respect to the problems in his own specialty, but in the work of CIOPS as a whole. He made specific contributions to the formulation of the CIOPS Charter (DON 1-1180) and its organizational implementation (DON 1-1216). As a consequence of the reorganization of C10PC, he has been designated as an Associate Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations for Operations. In conformity with the indication of Chief, CIOPS he has reorganized his component accordingly and cofrancs resources consisting of 17 officers and junior officers and six clerical personnel (one GS-15, five GS-14s, five 65-135. three 6-125, 20065-1ls, one GS-08 1.A., one GS-07 clerical, t) GS-065, three (6-05s) through which he covers Penetration operations, Double Agents, Soviet and Bloc operations against Americans overseas. Disinformation and Deception, and Counterintelligence COMINT. He has charged each of his operating sections with appropriate Letters of Instruction. he is meticulously informed of the work going on in each of his charges. Under his quidance and instruction there has been significant end measurable production and results during the past year. His pertenence of this task has been a model of conceptiori and execution and reflects most favorably on his capacity to prercise command and leadership.

SUBJECT: Newton Scott MILER. (012773)
Reporting Period I February 1973 - 31 January 1974

3. Mr. Miler is a case specialist in sensitive counterintel-ligence matters. He has a career accumulation of exposure, recall, and operational insight into past and present activity along these lines with the FBI, State Department, Department of Defense, and the military agencies. He is skilled in the conduct of counterintelligence and security liaison on a senior level with these agencies. It is noteworthy that he has the confidence of the FBI leadership and in the past year he has worked on sensitive counterintelligence cases involving the Soviets and Bloc with the FBI in a highly productive and professional fashion. In addition he has taken the initiative in developing and conducting productive liaison on counterintelligence cases involving Penetration and Disinformation with the British services, MI-5 and MI-6, and the RCMP, the Australian, and the New Zealand security services. Mr. Miler's work with MI-5 and MI-6 has involved the production of studies and the chairing of meetings among liaison specialists in Soviet clandestine agent radio communications. He is a working committee member of the national inter-agency organization dealing with the planning and execution of deception in Double Agent operations, working directly under the Chief, CIOPS in this respect. This task brings him into close and continuing relationship with the appropriate component of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other interested Federal agencies. Because of his grasp and appreciation of the day-to-day problems of the charter responsibilities of CIOPS, he takes part actively and effectively in the training and doctrinal presentations within and outside the Office of Training (OTR). In particular, he participates in senior-level OTR training activities (the Mid-Career Course) and during the period under review in a special advanced counterintelligence course sponsored jointly by OTR and CIOPS for senior officers of the Office of Special Investigations/Air Force (OSI/AF) and in FBI retraining of its field officers in counterintelligence matters.

4. In addition to his managerial and advisory functions outlined above, Mr. Miler is charged with the management of specific live operations under the direction of Chief, CIOPS. Among other things, he is charged with the handling of a difficult and complex Soviet defector contact. This relationshis requires the dedication of very much of his own time, and the presentation of detailed contact reports on a continuing basis and the raintenance of a very high order of personal and professional discipline.

5. It is impossible to say too much in praise-worthy description of the performance of this officer. He is one of the hardest working.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: N. Scott MILER
(1 March 1972 - 28 February 1973)

MEMORANDUM in Lieu of Fitness Report

SUBJECT: Newton Scott MILER
(1 April 1969 - 31 March 1970)

1. During the current rating period Mr. MILER was transferred from his previous position as Deputy Chief of the Special Intelligence Group of the Counter Intelligence Staff to the position of Chief of the Operations Group of the same Staff. This was a new position and as such required unusual skills and vigor to give dimension to the job to be done. Mr. MILER approached his task with imagination and energy. He inherited an incohesive group of capable officers and immediately began the task of trying to define common denominators for their operational activities, to weed out duplicatory and marginal tasks, to establish clearly delineated guidelines and to provide a sense of discipline, all aimed toward giving better counterintelligence guidance and support to the operations of the area divisions and the operational components of the CA Staff.

2. At the same time Mr. MILER has continued to handle, under the direct guidance of the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, a number of extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and developmentally. The cases required not only keen operational sense in their handling, but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved frequent high-level discussion and negotiation with other components of CIA as well as with outside agencies and departments. In fulfilling these.. responsibilities, Mr. MILER has worked without regard to hours or to his personal convenience. He has assiduously tried to reflect the thinking of the Chief of the CI Staff and to relate it to the operational problems he is handling. He has also given mature, insightful supervision and encourage- ment to the orientation and development of a Deputy Chief, Operations, another important innovation in the Staff's organization.

3. As a member of the Program Review Panel Mr. MILER con- tributed fully in examining, reviewing and commenting on the programs of the operating components within the Clandestine Service. He, together

SECRET
EYES ONLY

![stamp]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 229

SECRET
EYES ONLY

with other members of the Panel have striven to devise a formula to
give management a clear, concise picture of what we intend to do and
what we are doing and have done to make those intentions reality.

4. Mr. MILER has maintained contact with a number of key
   foreign intelligence officials with whom he has worked overseas. His
   home has been available to them during their visits to the United States.

5. While being able to adjust his own thinking when and as
   required by a given situation, Mr. MILER has strong personal con-
   victions on operational matters and does not hesitate to advance his
   opinions or to push for his recommended solutions.

6. Mr. MILER is currently directing an office which includes
   in its complement one GS-16 and GS-15s. He is also responsible
   for the career development of more junior case officers. The
   above is in addition to the normal supervision of the remaining group
   staff. In performing these functions, he is cost-conscious and econo-
   mizes in the expenditure of government funds and the valuable time of
   senior officers.

7. Mr. MILER would be the first to admit that many problems
   remain for him in his current assignment. He would also readily ack-
   nowledge that he has not yet been able to clearly define each of these
   problems or to provide the perfect solution for every one which has
   been isolated. Progress, however, is being made every day and Mr.
   MILER clearly demonstrates that his promotion to GS-16 in 1969 was
   deserved and that it will not be the last which he will merit. This is
   an officer of high professional integrity and dedication. He is a self-
   starter, he works and thinks realistically. He speaks his mind when
   he has something to say - including critical things, yet retains a good
   sense for the craftsman's side of the CI job. He is not adept just at
   identifying problems, he finds the solution.

SECTION C

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Miler is an alert, intelligent, and experienced officer who has worked hard to produce results in what has proved over the past years to be an extremely difficult area in which to operate. With some notable exceptions, the station under his direction has failed to surmount these environmental problems and to develop productive operations against high priority targets. This should not be interpreted as meaning that the station has failed to mount new operations; merely that fewer key operations have been mounted than Headquarters would have desired.

Mr. Miler has been rated as adequate in his liaison with the Ambassador and other members of the country team despite the fact that the Ambassador, in a private conversation with Headquarters officers, indicated his dissatisfaction and that of the Deputy Chief of Mission with what the Ambassador described as Mr. Miler's failure to participate in country team activities and his failure to establish a satisfactory working relationship with the Ambassador. On the basis of the Ambassador's comments Mr. Miler might have been given a rating of "Weak" on this point. However, in view of the problems which sometime develop in the field in

coordinating agency operations with the overall policy objectives of the Embassy, the rating officer believes that Mr. Miler must be given the benefit of the doubt on this point.

The station under Mr. Miler's direction has been successful in developing CA operations within the field of labor, and liaison operations have improved considerably in recent months. Mr. Miler has been particularly successful and cooperative in servicing requests for operational support from other field stations. He has provided valuable support and coordination in Africa Division's efforts to penetrate and influence an effective and moderate all-African organization.

Mr. Miler has satisfactorily performed his supervisory duties, supervising nine persons within the station, as well as providing guidance for communications personnel located in a large communications base in Ethiopia. He is cost conscious and fully understands the need for economy.

APR 29 3 37 PM '63

Subject has been at his present post for about eighteen months. He has been working against most difficult targets involving a government and a society enormously frustrating to deal with. In the light of this situation, it can only be said that the results of his efforts have been gratifying. Subject's performance, in any case, has been highly professional. He has succeeded in effecting a great amount of clarity regarding some fairly long-standing and complicated operational activities. He is particularly strong in the CA field. This is Subject's first assignment as a Chief of Station and it is interesting to observe that he possesses a great deal of natural managerial skill. In supervising subordinate personnel he has also considerable competence. Although he has experienced difficulty in the handling of one officer, there is no evidence that Subject has fallen short of doing his duty. Morale at his Station is high. Reference should be made to Subject's highly-developed sense of integrity and intellectual honesty. Another strong and useful attribute is his innate sense for anticipating possible Agency-Embassy problems and to act upon them before they evolve. If there is any weakness in Subject's performance as Chief of Station, it is probably the occasional belated communication to Headquarters. This Branch considers itself fortunate to have Subject in his present position and supports his desire to extend for one year beyond the expiration of his present tour. Subject's promotion during 1962 is further evidence of Headquarters' confidence in him.

# SECRET

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable instead but relates its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating.

Subject is a highly qualified oporations officer with demonstrated executive abilities. His primary shortcoming is his lack of self-discipline as far as his personal self is concerned. This has rosulted in subject's inability to observe normal working hours as reporting for duty. It is not meant to infer that subject has been lax in total number of hours devoted to his job, rather he is inclined to set his own schedule, claining illness as the cause. In considering the above, it should be kept in mind that subject has been in the field over three years, and is overdue for a montal and physical rest. It is reccommended that subject be considered for a Headquarters assignment in a senior operations capacity.

1. 
The REPORTING OFFICER is in the INTERIATE SUPERVISOR IN HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP, DEPENDING UPON CIRCUM-
stances. In any case, the chief of station will ensure the immediate supervisor does his responsibility
with the rating of the reporting officer when the rating of the reporting officer will change or modify the rating of the
such changes or modifications are called for. The chief of station is ultimately responsible for the
accuracy of facts and statements which appear on the status and efficiency report. In many cases, es-
pecially in a small unit, the chief of station may wish to fill out all the reports himself.

2. IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL REPORT, the following special reports, utilizing the same form, will be rendered:

A. UPON COMPLETION OF FIRST NINETY (90) DAYS OF SERVICE AT A STATION.

B. UPON RELIEF OR REASSIGNMENT OF REPORTING SENIOR.

C. UPON DETERMINATION OR RECOMMENDATION THAT AN EMPLOYEE IN A FIELD STATION SHOULD BE REASSIGNED TO
OTHER STATION OR RETURNED TO U.S. FOR REASSIGNMENT OR OTHER DISPOSITION. SUCH REPORT WILL BE FORWARDED
SO AS TO REACH THE WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE AFTER SUCH REASSIGNMENT DETER-
MINATION IS MADE. IF POSSIBLE, THE REPORT SHOULD BE SENT IN AT LEAST THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO PROPOSED RE-
ASSIGNMENT IN ORDER THAT ALL TIME POSSIBLE MAY BE DEVOTED TO APPRAISAL AND EVALUATION. IF CONSIDERATION
OF REASSIGNMENT IS BEING GIVEN WITHOUT EMPLOYEE'S KNOWLEDGE. ITEMS 1 TO 6 WILL BE FILLED IN AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE BY THE RATING OFFICER WITHOUT REFERRAL TO EMPLOYEE.

3. IN FAIRNESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL BEING RATED AND IN THE INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE IMPORTANCE OF CAREFUL-
   LY PREPARED AND ACCURATE EFFICIENCY REPORTS CANNOT BE OVERSTRESSED. THE FOLLOWING BASIC PRINCIPLES OF RATING
   SHOULD ALWAYS BE KEPT IN MIND:

A. ALWAYS BASE YOUR JUDGMENT ON:

(1) WHAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED THE INDIVIDUAL DO OR FAIL TO DO.

(2) TYPICAL PERFORMANCE, NOT ON AN ISOLATED STRIKING INCIDENT.

(3) EXAMPLES RELEVANT TO THE CHARACTERISTIC UNDER CONSIDERATION.

(A) THE EFFICIENCY REPORT IS TO BE USED TO RATE ALL CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES. BUT REPORTING OFFICERS
SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT DIFFERENT STANDARDS PREVAIL IN DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS WHEREAS IT IS
NECESSARY, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER POSSESS INITIATIVE; THIS SAME TRAIT IS
NOT ALWAYS DESIRABLE, EXCEPT IN A MINOR WAY. FOR A TYPIST, THE RATINGS AND EVALUATIONS
SHOULD BE IN REFERENCE TO THE JOB - THE ACTUAL WORK ASSIGNMENT FOR WHICH THE PARTICULAR EM-
PLOYEE IS BEING PAID. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ARRIVE AT A JUST ESTIMATE OF THE QUAL-
ITIES OF THE PERSON REPORTED ON FOR THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT. AVOID EXAGGERATIONS
AND SUPERLATIVES: THEY DETRACT FROM THE VALUE OF A REPORT AND ARE UNFAIR TO OTHERS.

B. BIASED OPINIONS BASED ON PERSONAL LIKES AND DISLIKES MUST BE SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDED. IT
SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE PREPARATION OF EFFICIENCY REPORTS IS AN IMPORTANT FUNC-
TION OF ALL SUPERVISORS OF EMPLOYEES, AND THE ACCURATE AND TRUE EVALUATIONS EXPRESSED
THEREIN ARE A DIRECT REFLECTION UPON HIS OWN ABILITY AND QUALIFICATION FOR THE POSITION
HE HOLDS.

C. NO REPORTS WILL BE RENDERED COVERING PERIODS OF LESS THAN 60 DAYS OBSERVED SERVICE.

4. REPORTS WILL NORMALLY BE CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL: HOWEVER, THE CLASSIFICATION MAY BE RAISED IF DEEMED AD-
   VISABLE BY RATING OFFICER.

5. REPORTS WILL NEVER BE SHOWN TO THE EMPLOYEE REPORTED ON.

### DISPOSITION OF REPORTS

1. REPORTS WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE APPROPRIATE BRANCH CHIEF IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS WITHIN TEN (10)
   DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD.

2. IF THE REPORTING OFFICER IS THE CHIEF OF STATION, REPORTS WILL BE FORWARDED BY HIM TO THE APPROPRIATE
   BRANCH CHIEF IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS.

3. IF THE REPORTING OFFICER IS NOT THE CHIEF OF STATION, THE REPORT WILL BE REFERRED TO THE NEXT IN COM-
   MAND FOR REVIEW AND FINALLY TO THE CHIEF OF STATION FOR FORWARDING TO WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS.

4. UPON RECEIPT OF REPORT IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS, THEY WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE BRANCH CHIEFS PROMPT-
   LY AND THEN REFERRED TO THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE FOR PERSONNEL FOR RETENTION IN THE PERSONNEL FILE OF THE EMPLOY-
   EE.

A. IF A CHANGE OF PERSONAL STATUS IS REPORTED UNDER SECTION 6, ONE COPY OF SUCH REPORT WILL BE DE-
TACHED AND SENT TO THE SECURITY OFFICE.

# SECTION IV

COMMENT:

Subject's grades speak better than any comments could. There is no question but that he brought more to the course and consequently had less to gain from it than any of his fellow students, which makes his performance the more worthy. His assistance to the instructors with Far East material is much appreciated.

SUBJECT: Training Evaluations for Phase III #2

1. Attached is a training evaluation for one of the students who completed Phase III Course #2.

2. This student participated in the second presentation of the revised five-week curriculum for this course. As the course develops, it is possible to provide more detailed reports of performance, as represented by the nine grades assigned in Section II, "Performance Record."

3. As a consequence of introducing new material, there was considerable delay in returning graded assignments to the students, and some of the later assignments were not graded until after the course was completed. Because of this, students did not have sufficient opportunity to profit from the errors in their earlier performance. This factor should be considered when interpreting the attached report.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Retirement - Scott Miler

1.  The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of a memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retirement will be recommended to the Director under the provisions of the CIA Retirement and Disability System pertaining to involuntary retirement, in no way implies an adverse action. Subject signed an application for retirement of his own volition in order to qualify for an immediate retirement annuity. The liberalized criteria for such separations was established by the Agency to parallel similar action under the Civil Service Retirement System in accordance with FPM Letter No. 831-23, dated 10 December 1969.

2.  Any inquiry received concerning the nature of the separation of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed simply as a retirement.

1. This is a recommendation for Mr. Miller from Grade GS-05 to GS-10.

2. The career of this officer has been notably drive, and marked throughout with relatively stabilization for his age. His youth, initiative, self-assurance, capacity for work, talent for determining the objectives, recognizing the problem, organization of the work to be done, administering and supervising the effort, have long been evident to those for and with whom he has worked. Years of service during which he is steadily centered has resulted in a recognition, by supervisors and subordinate fellow-workers all his wide experience, proven sound administrative and executive talent coupled of expression both oral and written and demonstrated capacity for work. He is unquestionably a very outstanding officer.

3. Having entered on duty as a Code Clerk (GS-05) in October 1946 following a A.B. degree in Economics from Dartmouth College in a Navy V-12 Program, he was soon assigned to Seoul where he remained a short period before a temporary assignment to open the communications Station in Seoul, Korea.

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation

JUL 26 1968

During the week of July 8 - 12, 1968, the Office of Security held a seminar for selected State Department overseas security officers. Among the multitude of subjects on the agenda, I considered none more important than personnel security. I was, therefore, immensely pleased that Mr. Scott Miler accepted our invitation to speak on "Foreign Intelligence Operations Against U. S. Personnel."

Citing statistics from his extensive research, Mr. Miler impressed us with the magnitude of hostile targeting efforts against Americans overseas. After this informative briefing, he engaged the conferees in a productive exchange of views on solving problems of mutual concern.

I am most grateful to you for permitting Mr. Miler's participation in our Regional Security Officer Seminar and hope that you will extend to him my appreciation for his excellent talk.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. N. SCOTT MILER

VIA: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJ: Expression of Appreciation (U)

1.(U) I hereby express my appreciation for service of the highest degree of excellence provided to my office during the past several months. You displayed professional competence that can only be described as exemplary in nature.

2.(U) It is unfortunate that the work on which you performed is of such a nature that it precludes a specific description herein, but that need not detract from the significance of this message of approbation. Of all the attributes displayed, the two most worthy of note are your use of imagination and persistence. These two qualities enabled you to produce results-witch-others had not been able to obtain. Near failure was transformed into success.

3.(U) Not to be ignored is your administrative ability. The marshaling of resources available to you and coordination of the efforts of your available personnel contributed materially to the degree and quality of results obtained as well as the expeditious manner in which you proceeded. Also, selflessness was manifested by your willingness to ignore assigned working hours and press on as long as any hope existed for obtaining results.

4.(C) As you are aware, the results achieved by you have significance beyond the boundaries of the Navy. The full import cannot be completely evaluated at this time but it is known that the lives of many persons will be enriched by your efforts. It is regretted that all persons affected will not have the opportunity to express their thanks to you in person for the part you have played.

5.(U) On behalf of all persons who will benefit from your efforts, and on behalf of the Navy and myself, I again express my deepest appreciation and say to you a most hearty "Well done".

6.(U) If it is consistent with the policy of your Agency, it is requested that a copy of this letter be made a part of your official record.

Chief, Public Safety Division
International Cooperation Administration
Washington 25, D. C.

Re: Newton S. Miler

Dear Theo:

You have by now received our unclassified cable, TOICA 1408,
advising of our acceptance of the resignation of liewton S. Kiler who
has served since December 29, 1956, as Chief of our Criminal
Investigation branch, Public Safety Division, UCH/T. It was with
deep regret that i accepted the resignation since his departure on or
about April 15, 1958, will be felt very keenly by both the Chief of
the Division, ir. Al Dubois, and myself.

Were it not for the pressing need of stateside medical
attention for his wife and the fact that he should be with her
during this period, I should have enicavored to prevail on him to
take an alternative course of action. However, I am satisfied that
there was no alternative and, hence, did accept the resignation
effective April 15, 1958, it being noted that he is returning with
his family to the States at his own expense.

This letter is to advise you of the facts leading to what
would appear to be a suiden resignation. I also want to inform you
that Miler's job performance here has, in my estimation, been of high
order and can very easily be swamarized by stating that he has
performed most satisfactorily.

He has shown himself consistently to be tactful, considerate,
and objective in mis approach to his responsibilities and in the
performance of his duties. I have at all times found that his judgrænt
has been souni ana mature. He has had warm and mutually satisfying
relationship with his opposite numbers in the Thua 1 police.

In furtherance of my statement of my confidence in him, I
unhesitatingly designated him as Acting Grief of our ruplic jafety
Division during Fr. Bois absence on TW in washington for the period
March 9 through Aril 5, 1958. I naturally a continuing personal

contact with him during that period and observed his handling of himself in Executive Staff meetings. The various attributes which I cited abere were clearly demonstrated curing this period and, in fact, his permance during this period permits me to add that I am satisfied with his supervisory abilities.

I would have no hesitancy in recommending his reemployment by ICA in the future the present family health situation is rectified.

CEC. 7.

In the Spring of 1949 I was cuentioned by a Postal Inspector about a letter I hoe mailed approximately on year previous for a Kr. Entren. He was the Display mon for Allen ara Jertson Bordwa pe Co. in Turer 1000s, Ala. I had been workim with 11: for some time dressing windors, palating and decorating.

The letter in question was addreaned to fre. Helren, who was out of torn, and supposedly con- Loined some money. I believe it woo doller. The letter was received but there was no money in it.

I stated that I bed krown nothing of any money and that I also had a fel ow with me when the letter was railed. I wrote to Mr. Faleen bout the Incloent but never les ro from F1.

There were apparently no further Inquiries I have heerd nothing siree the Postal Inseator questioned me.

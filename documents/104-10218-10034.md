The workers of the plant were holding a social evening at their Palace of Culture, and the distinguished guest was greeted by thousands of people. Both Nikita Khrushchov and Fidel Castro were presented with models of the ZIL car made at the Works. Before the concert, Nikita Khrushchov, Fidel Castro and his party saw a documentary film about the Works, which was the first Soviet automobile plant. Famous performers and amateurs took part in the concert, which wound up with the "July 26th March". The last bars were drowned in enthusiastic applause, and cries of "Viva Fidel!" and "Viva Cuba!" resounded in the hall long afterwards.

# LEFTIST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES-Soviet Directed Insurgency

Monthly CI Report
OSI District 30
May 1963

(S) (Gp-1) A Soviet Embassy official in Mexico City, Nikolai S. LEONOV, is allegedly actively planning an insurgent movement in Latin America. LEONOV left Mexico for the USSR on 21 April to confer with: KHRUSHCHEV and CASTRO. Credence is given this report by the publication of a photograph of the three on 8 May in a Cuban newspaper. The photograph was purportedly taken during a recent Leeting.

(S) (Gp-1) Cuba and Mexico, according to LEONOV's schemes, would serve as bases for the insurgency... Cuba would be the "invisible beachhead" and Mexico the point for covert distribution of arms.

(S) (Gp-3) The individual selected as the contact man for arms acquisition is said to have been engaged in similar activity in Guatemala about a year ago.

(S) (Gp-3) Another report from sources in Colombia stated that pro-CASTRO ex-President CARDENAS planned to call a meeting in Mexico City of "leftist bent", disgruntled retired military officers from Latin American countries on the subject of insurgency. (DIA, 3 June 1963)

The Soviet Government has assured the Cuban Government that it will give its assistance to the Cubans in the event of an aggression against Cuba. The Soviets consider Guatemala to be the most sensitive spot in Latin America at the present time, and are very interested in the Guatemalan problem. Because of this the Soviets are prepared to give their all out assistance to both countries in their current political struggles.

Chief of Station, Mexico City

Possible Exploitation of Links of Soviet Embassy

Officer with Cuban 26th of July Movement

For your information

AI-10265, 29 November 1961

HRK-15907
HEADQUARTERS FILE NO

15 December 1961

Nikolai Sergeyevich LEONOV returned to Mexico 11 July 1960 and has been assigned to the Soviet Embassy staff, Third Secretary, diplomatic rank, as an assistant to Vladimir KHITROV in the Office of Cultural Affairs. While the Station feels that Fidel CASTRO Ruz's recent public statements admitting his long-time sympathies and associations with Communism somewhat lessens the exploitation impact of this "expose", it is also felt that LEONOV's Mexican background, dating back to 1955 and including the incident played up by the Mexican press in 1956, is worthy of press replay. LEONOV's return and present responsible position in the Soviet Embassy of Mexico will provide added interest in the story. The Station will therefore attempt to obtain the Mexican press accounts of the 1956 incident, updating this information into a press article for exploitation as suggested in references.

1. Your attention is directed to reference A which mentioned the proposed KW/CAGE exploitation of the finding of the personal calling card of Nikolai S. LYNOV in the address book of Fidel CASTRO As.

2. Although there were ODIFEX reports at the same time as reference A, which recounted that the Mexican press carried a (scarcely accurate and complete) account of the bresum of the Cuban revolutionary conspiracy, that the leader was linked with the Soviet Embassy and that he carried in his wallet a card of LYNOV, Secretary to the Soviet ambassador, it can not be determined at Head- quarters whether there was specific Station planning of this incident.

3. In reviewing Station dispatches pertaining to the CASTRO case, reference B was examined, as well as its attachment, the report of LYNOV. The latter apparently attempts to explain the circumstances under which the personal card of LYNOV was "planted" in the CASTRO address book. A discrepancy is noted in the reconstruction of the incident of the arrest of CASTRO and the discovery of LYNOV's card in that both the reference and the attachment describe the circum- stances surrounding the arrest of CASTRO as occurring in November 1956 whereas reference A had already reported the arrest and discovery of LYNOV card in the address book as having occurred in June 1956.

4. Now, there is renewed interest in this matter due to the fact that reference C reported LYNOV's return to Mexico for what appears to be a second tour of duty.

5.  The views of Station Mexico are requested as to whether it would be feasible to replay the original incident indicating the tie between CASTRO and LFOV. Even if the incident was not exploited before, it is the opinion of Headquarters that it would be useful to cite a specific CASTRO tie with the Soviets before he took over in Cuba. From a Headquarters viewpoint the alleged action of LIVESPAK/2 in "planting" the card would still not impair the replay of the original incident.

SOURCE, SOURCE EVALUATION, APPRAISAL OF CONTENT: Source having access to
Soviet diplomatic circles in Mexico. Considered Content: Documentary.

## I. SOVIET EMBASSY ACTIVITIES - RELATIONS

The following information on the activities of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico was developed during the month of October 1956. Separate reports will be furnished on the Commercial and on Cultural and Propaganda
Activities of the Embassy. References made below to the visiting Soviet musicians will be detailed in a special report concerning the activities of the musicians while in Mexico.

## II. DIPLOMATIC

### A. Relations with Mexican Governments

1. On 1 October the secretary of Alfonso Eduardo Diaz, Private Secretary to Foreign Minister Padilla Nervo, conferred with Leonid Kadymov, Third Secretary of Soviet Embassy, about a dinner being given by the Embassy the following evening. Soviet Ambassador Anatoliy Dobrynin invited him and his wife to attend a piano concert with him after the dinner.

2. On 3 October Kadymov informed Dobrynin that he was very embarrassed about what had happened the previous evening, but he had had a meeting with Padilla Nervo and had not gotten out until 8:30 p.m. He had not known whether to go to the Embassy or to the concert, and asked that Dobrynin excuse him with the Ambassador.

3. The private secretary of Jose Gorostiza, Sub-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, left a message at the Soviet Embassy on 3 October indicating he would be unable to accompany the Ambassador to the concert by a Soviet violinist that evening as he had to attend a special dinner. However, Gorostiza had apparently accompanied the Ambassador to a piano concert the previous evening.

Official Activities

LEONOV remains an obscure figure and although we assume he is employed in the administrative section of the Chancellery, we cannot pinpoint his duties. He has identified himself from time to time as the secretary to the Ambassador, has been noted taking his turn as embassy duty officer and has taken hospital bedside guard duty. During 1958, before the arrival of the regular administrative officer, Vladimir Ivanovich ZHUKOV, in November 1953, LEONOV was handling calls concerning goods and services but was probably merely filling in, because of his facility with the Spanish language, until ZHUKOV's arrival. In December 1954 APARINOV asked one of the guards whether he had the keys to LECNOV's room in the embassy. Since, during that time, we believe LEONOV was residing at Industria 71, it would appear that LEONOV had a private office in the embassy, one which was apparently kept locked when he was away. One or two other very vague references indicate he might have something to do with communications work. Beginning about November 1955 LEONOV began to emerge as an interpreter and translator. He spent a good deal of time with the Social Security delegation, with Soviet pianist GILELS and with Soviet movie director ALEKSANDROV, each time appearing as the interpreter or translator. His recent association in January 1956 with the daughter of Communist General Heriberto JARA also involved translation work. Other more recent references make us begin to wonder now if LEONOV might not be connected with the Cultural Section. During the last two months of 1955 he appeared to be associated in work with FASTUKKEVICH, director of the Soviet Embassy Information Bulletin. In March 1956, when PAPOROV could not keep an appointment at University City at the invitation of Mexican President RUIZ CORTINES, he asked that either LEONOV, GUNDAREV or POPOV keep the appointment. It is known that PAPOROV, GUNDAREV and POPOV are all definitely assigned to the Cultural Section indicating further that LECNOV may be associated with that group. We, therefor, classify LEONOV as

EMM-1524 (9 Apr 58)
LECNOV

having worked in the administrative section until late 1955 when his position began to appear as that of translator and interpreter, perhaps more clearly associated with the cultural section. Again, however, he may still be assigned to administrative work in the Chancellery which overlaps with the cultural end.

LECNOV's contact with Samuel RAMOS as dispatched in HWA-4356 (19 March 1956) was reported again on 7 March 1958 when RAMOS called LECNOV and the two discussed a chess tournant to which Soviet delegates were apparently to be invited. When LECNOV asked from where RAMOS was calling, he replied from his home. RAMOS stated he was now back in class "at the University" and so "we won't be able to meet at my house now." RAMOS invited LECNOV to one of the tournaments the following week and also made arrangements to visit subject at the embassy to give him the list of books "which we (want)...".

Unless LEONCV has something to do with consular affairs, we are at a loss to explain the following LIMERICK reference. On 10 November 1955 a man identifying himself as "your friend, Col. GONZALEZ" asked LEONOV if he had found out about some matter he had requested. It appeared that LEONOV had forwarded the "request" to the USSR and that the Mexican Ambassador to the Soviet Union was to notify Col. GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ stopped short after starting to ask what happened to that matter, explaining it would be better if they got together and talked it over. The two arranged to meet at the embassy. At the beginning of the conversation GONZALEZ, in recalling to LEONOV's mind who he was, stated, "We were chatting about this project which I have to present to the Presidencia about the use of the waters from the Toluca volcano, Chinantecatl." The Cia. Exportadora e Importadora Boxicana, S.A. (CEIMSA) had commissioned GONZALEZ to go to Chihuahua to see some areers and therefore he was not able to contact LECNOV earlier.

Other then the two preceding LIMERICK refereness, which in themselves are inconclusive, we have no indication that LECNOV is engaged in RIS activities.

There are vague references suggesting that the LECNOVs may be leaving Mexico in April 1956.

## Private Activities

During February 1954 LEONOV was hospitalized at the Sanatorio Lalinde there he underwent an appendectomy performed by Dr. Gustavo BAZ.

A L1000 1-2 reference of August 1954 revealed that former Soviet Consul MELNIKOV and his wife agreed that LECHOV played well (possibly a musical instrument or a ball game ??). During March 1955, after he had arranged a movie or given a lecture, two of the embassy wives remarked on how good LECHOV was. (It is known that LEONOV has taken his turn at giving Political Information Class lectures.) LEONOV also appears to enjoy athletics - he plays tennis, attends shooting matches, arranges football games with the Caechs, and plays volleyball. He takes some sort of lessons, not necessarily Spanich, in the embassy. As for LECNCV'S feeling about American movies, he was heard to tell one of the Social Security delegates, "You can really run into trash in an American film,"

HR-1524 (9 Apr 56)
LEONOV
page 51

It is reported by LIMERICK that LEONOVA gives some sort of instruction to embassy personnel and although it is not known just what type of lessons these may be, we venture a guess that she teaches Spanish. During October 1955 LEONOVA underwent a very serious operation, lasting two hours, during which the anesthetisation had to be discontinued because her heart could not take the strain, LEONOVA returned to work again in November 1955.

Although one vague reference hinted that LEONOVA may be pregnant now, there have been no allusions to any children the LEONOVS might have. When MATVETEV returned from home leave in the USSR in October 1955, while LEONOVA was undergoing her operation, he said he had seen LEONOVA's father but, because of his age, it would be better that he not be told of her sickness.

Samuel RAMOS; Renee SALCO Burger; et al

1. LIMERICK reported that on 24 February 1956 one Samuel RAMOS contacted Nikolai S. LEONOV, who acts as secretary to the Soviet Ambassador in Mexico. RAMOS told LEONOV "We are not going to meet at my house this afternoon but at SALCO's (which is at) Insurgentes 429-51 at the usual hour." LEONOV replied that he thought he could get to the meeting at 1900 hours and sent greetings "to the boys." RAMOS said "we have some books we want to order" through LEONOV.

2. On the face of it, this conversation appeared to be quite unusual and attracted the interest of this Station. Furthermore, it is known that for years the Soviets have used the hours between 1900 and 2000 for meeting clandestine or unusual contacts in Mexico.

3. The following steps ware taken to ascertain general information on RAMOS and "SALCO":

a. Station file record on Samuel RAMOS resulted in no clear identifications. There is a Samuel RAMOS who was listed in 1948 as Rector of the School of Philosophy and Letters of the University.

b. LIESTHENITE ascertained that the address mentioned is occupied by a female doctor named Renee SALCO Burger, allegedly of French nationality, who operates a beauty parlor. This is confirmed in the telephone book.

c. Files of this office indicate an ODENVY report that one Renee SALCO was a member of the Hungarian club EMUNA in 1951. The files also show that one Alejandro BURGER was a member of the club and that he and Renee lived at the same address. The file further shows that one Andres SALCO was a member of the club and describes him as a Communist sympathizer.

TOP SECRET

(d) Coordination with t Cultural Office in the procure of certain films, books, and other propaganda material, and distribution of same.

(3) Utilization of Mexico as springhoard for trade with other countries in Latin America.

## V. METHODS OF ECONOMIC PENETRATION

In order to attain economic objectives in Mexico, the Soviets utilize various methods. According to observations made about past and current activities, most of them fall under two headings, which overlap. These are:

(a) Extensive use of local business contacts.

(b) Cultivation of key people in various organizations which can be easily used as propaganda outlets (i.e., films and newspapers) or as more conventional contacts (banks and customs officials, etc.).

## VI. SOVIET COMMERCIAL CONTACTS AND TRANSACTIONS:

Set out below is a listing of the contacts made by the Soviet Commercial Office during December 1955, together with details as to the nature of these contacts, and the transactions made or proposed with them.

### A. Combined Propaganda and Commercial Contacts

1.  BANDERA, Molino, Juan,
    Peliculas Mexicanas.
    Ejido 45-107-105:
    Phones: 25-53-55; 36-46-05; 10-12-99; 18-22-48; 18-60-05; 21-50-81; 10-12-74.

BANDERA is a direct contact of the Soviet Commercial Office in the matter of film procurement, as well as an intermediary in securing Mexican films for the Soviets. It is known that the Soviets must purchase a certain amount of Mexican films; in order to be able to sell and exhibit theirs here. He was consulted several times during the month of December 1955, on film procurement. On 1 December 1955, MAYEVSKI (see IIA 2 Personnel), consulted BANDERA in reference to having BANDERA procure a certain film on time, so that a contract could be signed. Due to BOLSHAKOV's absence on a trip (see HMM-A-4109, pp. 2,3,4, 6 February 1956), MAYEVSKI wished to have the contract signed before 1 January 1956.

On 20 December 1955, BOLSHAKOV consulted BANDERA on whether the Mexican film "Raices" could be acquired. BANDERA explained that Cimex (a film company) controlled this film, but arranged a meeting for BOLSHAKOV with the director of Cimex, for 1100 on 21 December 1955.

2.  CALVET Mario Arce,
    Dicina Films De Mexico SA
    Av. Morelos 45-206-Bis 7-8
    Phones: 21-15-46; 35-98-04.

CALVET appears to be a very important contact for the Soviets in the coordination of various factors. According to information received, he is very

HMM-1464

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 99

active in Soviet films presented in. Mexico oothing out customs
difficulties, arranging for favorable publics Soviet films, and is
making an effort to circulate Soviet files severe in Mexico beside in
the capital. CALVET, according to ore report, is the sole exhibiter of
Soviet films in Mexico.

On 1 December 1955, MATE7S consulted CALVET about some books which he
(AYEVSKI) wished sent to the Soviet Export Film Office. MAYEVSKI nad
received a cable from Soviet Export Films on returning films which vere ca
peruit No. 117773242. CALVET arranged an appointment with JorgeRPETIS,
head of Cinematografia (Mexican Government film departant), for EVSKI
on 3 December 1:55. It is believed that FELETIS is the man to see for
withdrawal approvals,

On 17 December 1955, DECNOV, Nikolai Sergeyevich, an 'administrative employes
of the Soviet Embassy, contacted CALVET in reference to possible receipt by
CALVET of new Soviet fil-s. CALVET informed LECHOV that the only information>
he had, had been given to MAYEVSKI a few days back.

On 17 December 1955, it was ascertained that, BOLSHAKOV had been shown parts
of the films and tities of Soviet pictures, as. revised for showing in Mexico.
It was further ascertained that plans were afoot to inaugurate Soviet fila
showings at the "Teatro Ideal". The Teatro Ideal is alleged to have 1600
seats.

MAYEVSKI repeatedly told CALVET that he was interested in obtaining showings
for the Soviet films, "Romeo y Julieta," and "Gran Familia."

On 17 December 1955, TROPOV, Yevgeni Mikhailovich, 3rd Secretary of the Sorfat
Ecbassy, asked CALVET through MAYEVSKI to give certain films to the Soviet
Babassy.

Arrangements were made for POPOV and ROMANOV, Leonid Mikhailovich, 3rd
Secretary in the Embassy, to pick up some films. Among those obtained were
"Oran Familia," "Romeo y Julieta, and the "Golden Antelope."

On 19 December 1955, it was arranged for POPOV to call on CALVET for certain
films.

On 30 December 1955, the Soviet Embassy was notified by the Mexican Goverizant
that permissica had been received for showing certain films, but not for
"The Best in the world."

*Editorial Popu*

This Communist Fublishing and bookselling shop has been noted as in butlet fer,
Soviet books periodicale for years. Its two managers, Jesus LAZCARO and
Miguel AngelAASQUEZ, are both Comunist Party members. Over the years they
have imported a steady though relatively small amount of Soviet material,

In general, contact between the Editorial Popular and the Soviet Comercial
Office takes place through LAZCANO and VASQUEZ on the one hand, and IZC107 and
MAYEVSKI on the other..

It was ascertained that in December 1955, the Editorial Popular was selling copies of two Maxim Gorki's works, their titles translated into Spanish being *"Los Sarta Honos"* and *"Mi Infancia."*

4. CRIJAL7O (or CRIJALBO) Serres, Juan,
   General Manager of Exportadora De Publicaciones Mexicanas S. de R.L.,
   Av. De La Granjas 82
   Phone: 27-46-57

On 20 December 1955, GRIJALVO sent word to the Commercial Office that a book entitled *"Economia Politica,"* which the Soviets were apparently anxious to acquire, was ready and asked the Commercial Office to state the quantity needed.

B. Purely Comercial Activities:

1. EISENBERG, Jacques, was contacted on 16 December 1955, and reportedly told the Soviets that the affair with the electrodes would have to be postponed until 10 or 15 January 1956, due to his (EISENBERG's) sickness. This electrode transaction was connected with the visit to Mexico of two Soviet engineering experts (Comments: See HMM-A-4109, pp. 2-4, 6 February 1956). EISENBERG is known to be considering a deal with the Soviets in agricultural machinery, and to be participating in a trade agreement with the French Government in cotton. EISENBERG has been noted in connection with Czech comercial activities in Mexico.

2. GONZALEZ, Jose R.
   Uruguay 55-218

GONZALEZ is a frequent contact of the Soviet Embassy Commercial Section, and their actual and proposed transactions cover a rather wide range.

a. Rafias and Pipes

Early in December GONZALEZ and MAYEVSKI discussed the prospects for importing Soviet pipe and standard gauge railway rails into Mexico. It is reported that the market for rails in Mexico was first considered to be very hopeful, but the Soviets believed they might be able to arrange some sales in Central America.

b. Petroleums

CONZALEZ brought news that the Matarazzo industrial combine in Brasil had bought sufficient petroleum (from outside the Soviet orbit) to cover its needs for four months, but would need more when the above time expired. KATARAZZO asked for an estimate on about 15-20,000 tons of Soviet petroleum delivered in about 100,000 drums per boat.

c. Celluloses

CONZALEZ informed BOLSHAKOV that a US firm named PARSONS & WHITTEMORE wished to know why GONZALEZ was selling cellulose to Brasil, and further wished to know GONZALEZ' source of supply.

GONZALEZ informed BCLSA that an unnamed Chilean company wanted to buy 1000 tons of raw cellulose. Other information given by GONZALEZ was to the effect that he had received correspondent giving Finnish and Swedish prices on cellulose.

## Wood Pulp

GONZALEZ informed KYSANO that a large wood pulp company in Brasil was interested in doing business. It was reported that the transactions would be made with a Senior AYALA in Rio. The difficulty in dealing with AYALA was that he wished to have cargos marked as coming from another country, rather than the country of origin.

## Copper

It was also reported by GONZALEZ that someone named CHILDS was interested in making a deal in copper (no details).

It is reported that MCFA discussed on various occasions the mechanics of credit modifications with WATYNSKI. It was reported that MCFA mentioned the fact that other business firms had requested changes to modify the letters of credit, and it was also ascertained that the modifications for the letters of credit could be done. MCFA may be connected with the Naval foodshop.

A man named ZELLINGER also has various deals under discussion with the Soviets, among them being:

a) Alkalines and Alkaloids: ZELLINGER sought information on establishing a trade in alkalinės. It is believed that this deal may be well advanced. ZELLINGER expressed a need for araloids and for a special machine needed for this. It is reported that BOLSHAKOV informed ZELLINGER that either the machine or information on the machine had already been sent, and that ZELLINGER had an excellent mechanic with General Electric experience to install this machine.

b) Acids: According to information received, the USSR claimed not to have Letters of Credit for transactions involving Red Black and Blue Black acids.

c) Radios: ZELLINGER claimed to have a market for radios on the condition that these not be imported fully assembled. The purchasing people desired information on parts, assembly, details and pictures. It was highly desirable to import and assemble the radios here. In conjunction with this ZELLINGER claimed to have a market for TV parts.

d) Drills (Unspecified type): It is reported that ZELLINGER was involved in a transaction for $8,200 worth of drills (ZELLINGER is reportedly connected with ZLOTNIK, see below).

e) Medicines: It was ascertained that ZELLINGER had presented a list of medicines most widely used in Mexico. ZELLINGER, according to reports, had stated that he could sell as much of the medicines as could be provided him by the USSR.

f) Cameras: It was reported that ZELLINGER claimed to have a market for cameras.

9. ZLOTNIK, Abraham
   Toltecas 166

ZLOTNIK appears to be both an independent businessman and intermediary for other businessmen dealing with the USSR. It was ascertained that most of ZLOTNIK's transactions during the month of December concerned dyes. According to information gathered, delay on shipment of several types of (specified) dyes, was caused by the wait for a letter of Credit. Direct Violet K dye, for which a letter of Credit was opened on or about 30 November 1955, was not sent evidently due to shortage of sams. It was reported that the Soviet Commercial Office stated that, according to a contract dated 29 October 1955, all the dyes were packed and awaiting shipment from an unknown.

DISPATCH NO. EAVA-12223

DATE 31 October 1955

TO: Chief, E3
Attn: Silvan A. Robegn

FROM: Chief of Station, Vienna

SUBJECT: GENERAL Operational/REPIC
SPECIFIC DS-623 Identifications from Soccer Match Photographs

1. Shortly following DS-623's defection in January 1955, and again on 28 April 1955, Douglas M. Noir of FOB showed him the Vienna Station collection of soccer match photos. DS-623 was able to make 43 identifications from this collection, some by name and position, some only by function. In a few instances, as indicated specifically below, his identifications were erroneous, but are nonetheless forwarded on the assumption that even this fact will be of interest to you.

2. A total of twenty-one (21) separate photographs, some of them merely sections cut out of the original enlargements, are sent as an attachment to this dispatch. Persons identified by DS-623 are indicated on them by a heavy black inked circle around their heads; in a separate circle to the side, or in some instances above the circle surrounding their heads, are the numbers keyed to the list in Paragraph 3 below. In the event you have difficulty deciphering the numbers inked in on the front of the photos, you may refer to the reverse side, on which you will find the same numbers in approximately the same positions. We have just completed transmission of all negatives of the photos represented in the attachment. From these negatives, it will be possible for East Quarters to make individual blowups of the personalities identified by DS-623 for the appropriate Washington files. As you are already aware, the numbering system used on these negatives is that devised by the USIA Photo Section, which was responsible for taking the photos. For the six different matches represented in the attached photos, the following are the pertinent references:

a. Series 9954: Austria vs. Germany, Fall 1951. Negatives transmitted in EAVA-12175, 25 October 1955.

b. Series HFR 526: Austria vs. Portugal, 27 September 1953. Negatives transmitted in EAVA-12184, 25 October 1955.

c. Series HFR 532: Austria vs. Hungary, 11 October 1953. Negatives transmitted in EAVA-12163, 26 October 1954.

The young priests undergo a thorough study of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. After ordination they are appointed to parishes where they exercise their pulpit prerogative by preaching Communism to the faithful. As soon as one of these young priests is first appointed to a given parish, his first step is to go to the Communist Party secretary and ask him what the Party missions in the area are and how the priesthood could be of assistance in carrying out these missions.

6. It must be understood that religion is becoming a tool of the Communist Party of the USSR since most of the elder priests of the last generation, who would have fought Germanism, have died off or have been purged and the younger priests, who have replaced them, are completely dominated by Communist Party influence.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE ES-623, a Soviet electrical engineer, born in 1914, is a graduate of the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. From May 1950 to January 1953, he was General Director of the USIV Siemens-Schubert plant in Budapest. From January 1953 until his defection in January 1955, he was General Director of the USIA AEG Union plant in Vienna. During the war he became a member of the Communist Party and was always active in Party affairs, primarily because he found such participation expedient in furthering his career. He defected to the West because he feared that lengthy imprisonment would result from a forthcoming investigation of production of faulty transformers at his plant. Source is a well-educated, intelligent, and shrewd individual. Source was relatively reluctant to provide date on personalities known to him personally.

Following are biographic sketches of USIA Soviet personalities known to source. For further information on the duties of these individuals, see the above referenced report.

## Official Activitics

Our few references to LEXION make it appear that he, like ELYAKOV and ANTYASOV, with whom he seems to le vaguely associatad, is a t ird echelon functionary who probably performs a variety of administrative tasks in support of one or another phase of the Embassy operations and might be in on-the-job training for a specialised job as assistant to, at a guess, SMOILOV. In early August, shortly af- ter his arrival, he called a woman instructor at an of scuro local business school and was told that he could come by for his grades the following wee. (We infer from another convera tin that HITVEEV was a tending this school with him.) LEONOV was also with ANTYASOV and BELIUKOV when ATIASOV was detained on their way "back from the University" at the end of September. (Sees ATYASW.) This should indicate that he was principally occupied during the weeks after his ar rival in aequainting himself with local business methods and con ercial prao- tices, and perhaps taking some further formal instruction. Otherwise, his ap- paar nees in the traffic have been 11 ited to answering the telephone for both KOLOMYAKOV and SAMOILOV in their absence (w'thout raking decisions or taking any action) and, under the tutelagoof LAZAREV before the latter's deperture, making routine calls connected with ordering wine, pairing the movic projeo- tor, and the like. He has also occasionally been seen driving one or another of the Embassy automobiles, apparently filling in for one of the chauffeurs.

## Private 'ctivities

Our only information on LEGIOV's private life is the fact that the ZHEKOVS noved into the LEXIOV apartment (lo. 4 at Industria No. 71) upon their arrival

LENOV

on 7 November and the two couples lived together for about three weeks, when the LEONOVS moved into other quarters at Juancatlan 82. (There were no indications that the original arrangement had ever been intended to be other than temporary or that the subsequent move of the LCONOVS was due to friction between the two couples.) This raises the suggestion that ZUROV may be associated in some way with LEGNOV within the Embassy as well, a possibility which is borne out to some extent by the fact that both habitually answer and make calls from the same Embassy telephones.

Comment

We cannot yet assess LECHON for operational purposes.

LEONOVA
M184-623
24 March 54
Page 3

Name: Valeriya Ivanovna LEONOVA
Born: Unknown
Arrived in Mexico 11 July 1953 aboard *S Andron Gritti* in Veracrus with husband
No known title or position
Residence in Mexico: Junnacatlan 81
Children: None known, None in Mexico
Languages: Unknown
Other personal data: Nickname: LERA

## Private Activities

Although we have no definite indications to that effect, there is a fair possibility that LEONOVA is employed in some administrative or clerical position in the Embassy, since she seems to be present in the Chancery area a good deal during office hours and, without children, would not otherwise have a great deal to do.

Our only information relating directly to LEONOVA occurs during a conversation between APANASINOVA and MELNIKOVA on 26 October in which APANASINOVA complained bitterly that LEONOVA was shirking her share of responsibility in preparing food for the 7 November reception. LEONOVA had apparently failed to buy ingredients, after being asked to do so, on the plea that she had not been told exactly what kind of apples to get nor where to buy them. APANASINOVA: "KOMSOMOLTSI always brag about being in the front line, but in actuality, bah!" MELNIKOVA: "Yes, when I was at their home, we happened to discuss the reception, and Rita (ANTYASOVA) said, 'Why should we do the work for the reception?' I told her she should be ashamed of herself. I work in the Embassy and hold out during receptions and all holidays, and I don't complain. LEONOVA claims she is not going to do any shopping because she was not given the responsibility." APANASINOVA: "What does she mean? I met her and said 'Lera...'" She said she'd come over Sunday and make a list of the things to be bought." MELNIKOVA: "And she didn't come over. She was probably afraid of the work and the money involved. APANASINOVA: "How silly. I told her we would refund all expenses."

CONTACT

We infer that LEONOV (and perhaps her husband as well) is a good KOMSOMOL and may be endowed with the aggressively unpleasant personality which the Soviet system seems to foster so often. As shown in our photo coverage, both she and her husband have the appearance of persons who could be the well-disciplined, unquestioning, devoted Communists idealized in Soviet propaganda.

# Nikolay LEONOV

20 May 1955: Rodolfo NERVO called Subject and was told "We have found the books and material you requested (re Soviet foreign policy)." LEONOV said he would take the books to NERVO the next day. NERVO for many years active in the Mexican Diplomatic Service, at one time being Charge of the Mexican Legation in Warsaw, Poland. Now about 75 and inactive in Government, but does write articles for the newspaper Excelsior (HMA 3736 5 Dec 55).

6 January 1956: The daughter of General Heriberto JARA spoke with Subject at the Soviet Embassy saying she had been told that he was the person who could inform her of when she should come by to pick up translations of the "clinical documents" relative to herself and her father. Subject said they were having some trouble getting the documents translated because of the medical terms, but said they should be ready in about five days (HMA 4200).

1 February 1956: Subject called Velia Jara de NIETO, daughter of General JARA, and told her that the translations of her father's clinical history had been made from Russian into Spanish. Mrs. NIETO said she would visit the Embassy the next day and ask LEONOV for the materials (HMA 4410).

24 February 1956: One Samuel RAMOS contacted Subject who acts as secretary to Soviet Ambassador, Mexico. RAMOS told LEONOV "we are not going to meet at my house this afternoon, but at SALGO's (which is at) Insurgentes 423-51 at the usual hour." Subject replied that he thought he could get to the meeting at 1900 hours and sent greetings "to the boys." RAMOS said "we have some books we want to order through LEONOV" (HMA 4336).

2 March 1956: Samuel RAMOS left a message for Subject that "if he has time I hope he will come to my house today" (HMA 4600).

7 March 1956: Samuel RAMOS called Embassy and asked for data on the possibility of staging an international chess match in Mexico. In this conversation it was indicated that RAMOS is in the academic line of work. He stated that he was "back in classes" and that meetings could no longer be held in his home. He told LEONOV that a tournament featuring a person named "POMMARD" would begin Monday (12 March) and invited Subject to see some of it. LEONOV said he would attend if he had time. RAMOS then asked when he could see LEONOV to give him a list of books "we want". LEONOV told him to come to the Embassy at any time, and RAMOS said he would come right away (HMA 4600).

c. 27 June 1956: Subject's personal calling card found in address book of Fidel GASTRO Ruz, Cuban revolutionary detained in Mexico (MEXI 839 IN 35356 | REF: MEXI 825 IN 34161).

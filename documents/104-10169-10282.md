1. The ODENVY approval for passage of information on Subjects to the IMANTTIONS vas received in February, but, apparently through an inadvertence, vas retained an inordinately long time in KUODAK. It has just now reached our hands

2. ODENVY has approved the following for passage to the IMANTTIONS:

"Susan FRANK, nee Kailignan, wife of Richard C. FRANK of New York City, has for several years been active in Communist front organizations in the United States, has taught courses in such schools as the Jefferson School of Social Science, which appears on the Attorney General's list, and her writings have appeared in such magazines as "Political Affairs", which has been listed in the "Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications", and described as an official Communist Party theoretical organ. Susan FRANK appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities on 22 July 1959, and declined under "Privileges under the Fifth Amendment" to answer the Committee's questions as to whether or not she was a member of the Communist Party, had written an article which appeared in the November 1949 issue of "The Worker" entitled "No Peace for the Chinese People", had ever lecturel on Chinese culture and Chinese civilization and had been an instructor at the Faculty of Social Sciences. Susan FRANK had used the noms Susan Warren in her lecturas and writings, most of which indicate har interest in Chinese affairs."

"Richard C. FRANK, born 22 August 1922, has described his occupation as a free lance moving picture assistent director. He is known to have received Communist literature, is believed to have made financial contributions to the Communist Party in the U.S., and there is information to indicated Communist Party membership on his part as late as 1957."

3. ODENVY states that they have referred the case of the FRANKS to the Legal Attaches in London, Paris and Tokyo to alert appropriate security

services concerning possible travel of the FRANKS in England, France, and
Japan. Should the TBARTYIORS be able to furnish any additional info
concerning travel of Subjects, it is requested that you communicate it to
the appropriate KUBARK station for passage to the Legal Attache, and same info
Iga. This is still pertinent for although Subjects would by this time
probably be in China if they did in fact intend to go there - they may
possibly return to the U.S. via Prague, with a break of a month or so for
travel in Western Europe. According to what is known of their plans, they
do not intend to return to the U.S. before August or September.

References: ESIA 8833 dated 30 December 1959

1. The information provided in reference was most timely in its arrival. Shortly after we had received it, ODENVY informed us that the Frank couple was traveling abroad, and that in view of Susan Frank's interest in Far Eastern affairs and Chinese history it was not unlikely she and her husband would attempt to travel to China before returning to the U.S. ODENVY asked for any information we might receive which would indicate Subjects had traveled to China. We have passed the gist of the information in reference to OLREVY. We shall appreciate receiving any additional information on the activities of Subjects which you may be able to uncover utilizing liaison as you see fit. FYI: Susan Frank has indicated she does not expect to return to the states until August or September, and most likely the latter month.

2. The material in Headquarters' file on the Franks, all of which was supplied by ODKHVI, indicates they are active members of the Communist Party in the U.S. Upon receipt of ODEVY's approval to our request to pass a summary of this material to our official source of reference we shall forward the summary to you for passage to the IKARIYIOS. Meanwhile, the following, most of which was supplied by informants rated as having provided reliable information in the past, is forwarded for your information:

3. Susan Frank, nee Beiligmann, born 8 November 1913 of Russian parentage, resides with her second husband, Richard Cyril Frank, at 110 Christopher Street, New York City. There are reports as early as 1942 providing information on Susan Frank's activities in behalf of Communism, all of which refer to her as Susan or Sue Warren, the alias she has commonly used in her Communist activities and in articles she has written. One example of her activities in 1942 refers to an application for a permit to operate a public address system at street meetings in New York City. The application bore the signature of Sue Warren, and listed her as Chairman of the Communist Party at 132 East 26th Street, New York City. Since 1948 there have been numerous informant reports of Sue Warren's active participation in Communist affairs in the U.S., the most recent describing her as a member of the Greenwich Village Section, NY County CP as of October 1959. Frank has given her present occupation as writer and lecturer, and has taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Jefferson School of Social Sciences, conducting courses entitled, "The New China", "The Chinese Communes", "World of Socialism", "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions (Eno)", etc. The Faculty of Social Sciences was apparently established by Max Weiss, who was referred to in the April 1956 edition of the "Daily Worker" as "National Educational Director, Communist Party". The Jefferson School of Social Sciences has been designated by the Attorney General.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

SECRET ESEW 8273

On 22 July 1959 Susan Frank appeared before the House Committee on UN-American Activities, and refused under provisions of the Fifth Amendment to answer questions as to whether she had ever lectured on Chinese culture and Chinese civilization, had been an instructor at the Jefferson School of Social Sciences, was the author of an article in the 13 November 1949 issue of "The Worker" entitled, "No Peace for the Chinese People", and was "at this time" a member of the CP.

b. Richard Cyril Frank was born 22 August 1922 in Rochester, New York. He has given his profession as film technician and has worked in various directing and production jobs in television. Indications of Richard Frank's CP membership and activities in behalf of the CP are:

1. In June 1956 Sue Warren (Frank) stated at a Greenwich Village CP meeting that she could not contribute the $75.00 she had previously pledged because her husband (Richard Frank) had given $100.00 in "his club", and they had planned to contribute together only $150.00.

2. Frank was reported to have been seen on 1 February 1954 at a meeting of the New York Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions, which has been cited as a Communist front organization.

3. Frank has written letters in behalf of persons on trial for their Communist activities, has provided storage in the basement of his residence for cartons containing volumes of Communist literature, has received through the mail CP literature from Czechoslovakia, and has been a recipient through the mail of the "Daily Worker".

4. He has refused to speak to agents of OEVI about his activities.

Deputy Director (Plane)

SUBJECT: Susan and Richard Frank

1. In response to your 22 December communication (File No: 100-339235, 100-401762) we wish to inform you that we have received the following from an official Swiss source:

"Richard Frank (born 1922), U.S. citizen, film technician, resident of New York, arrived at the Hotel Savoy in Bern with his wife Susan on 10 December 1959; they stayed there until 12 December leaving for Zurich. Frank inquired for a flight ticket to Prague from Zurich. While in Bern, Frank had contact with the Chinese Communist Embassy on two occasions; he or Mrs. Frank having called at the Embassy. No information is available on the nature of these contacts, nor do we have more detailed personalia."

2. We have observed that persons desiring to travel to Communist China from Switzerland frequently fly via Prague.

3. The following summary has been drawn from material which you have provided us on subjects (see NY 100-43479, NY 100-107383 and Bureau 100-339235). Please advise if we may pass this summary to our Swiss source, but without revealing that your organization supplied the information contained in it.

Susan Frank, nee Halligan, wife of Richard C. Frank of New York City, has for several years been active in Communist front organizations in the United States, has taught courses in such schools as the Jefferson School of Social Science, which appears on the Attorney General's list, and her writings have appeared in such magazines as, "Political Affairs", which has been listed in the "Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications", and described as official Communist Party theoretical organ.

Susan Frank declined under "Privilege Activities on 22 July 1959, and declined under "Privilege under the Fifth Amendment" to answer the Committee's questions as to whether or not she was a member of the Communist Party, had written an article which appeared in the November 1949 issue of "The Worker" entitled, "No Peace for the Chinese People", had ever lectured on Chinese culture and Chinese civilization, and had been an instructor at the Faculty of Social Sciences. Susan Frank has used the name Susan Warren in her lectures and writings most of which indicate her interest in Chinese affairs.

Richard C. Frank, born 22 August 1922, has described his occupation as a free lance moving picture assistant director. He is known to have received Communist literature, is believed to have made financial contributions to the Communist Party in the U.S., and there is evidence to indicate he is a member of this party.

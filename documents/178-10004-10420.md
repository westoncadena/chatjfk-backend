# ORGANIZATION OF THE FILES
OF THE COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

The files have been left in the same basic organization as they were maintained by the lawyers during the investigation. The most helpful information in finding specific documents in the files is, therefore, an understanding of what areas were investigated by each team of lawyers.

Belin-Gray-Greene Files (B-G-G). The files of the executive director and his two special assistants are of a general nature, focusing on no particular portion of the investigation.

Schwarzer-Manfredi Files (S-M). This team was responsible for Chapters 14, 15 and 18 of the Report, on Watergate, domestic activities of the Directorate of Operations and CIA file systems.

Baker-Weidner Files. This team was responsible for Chapters 9, 10 and 11 and the federal portion of 17 of the Report, on mail intercepts, inter-agency domestic intelligence evaluation, CHAOS and CIA aid to other federal agencies.

Olsen-Roethe Files. (O-R). This team was responsible for Chapters 12, 13, 16 and 19 and the state and local portion of 17, on the Office of Security, the Directorate of Science and Technology, the Kennedy assassination and CIA assistance to state and local agencies.

Gellhorn-Cargill-Hardy Files (G-C-H). This team was responsible for Parts II and III of the Report, on the legal authority for the CIA and its internal and external controls.

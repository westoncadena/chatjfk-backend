# COURT OF HEARING OF PUERTO RICO

SUPERIOR COURT

San Juan Court

MANUEL MARTI,

Petitioner,

) Civil Case Num. CS-62-6720

) Concerning:

EX-PARTE.

) Ad Perpetuam Rei Memoriam

) 
RESOLUTION

This case was held before the undersigned Judge on 31 August 1962, with the intervention of the Prosecuting Attorney, having proved to the satisfaction of the Court the following: that the petitioner was born on 11 August 1910, in Utuado, Puerto Rico, the natural son of Juana Marti; that on birth certificate 636, page 237, book 44, for the year 1910, in Utuado, the petitioner appears with the first name Adrian; that this circumstance constitutes an error because the true and authentic first name of the petitioner is Manuel, which first name he has used since his birth; that the petitioner has two legitimate sons named Ivan and Manuel, who appear on their respective birth certificates with the surname Sotomayor, which constitutes an error because the legal surname of the aforementioned minors is Marti; that the petitioner used the surname Sotomayor erroneously because he believed that he had been recognized by his father.

In support of the allegations of the application, the petitioner presented attested and documentary proof to the complete satisfaction of the Court.

The births of the aforementioned children, Ivan and Manuel, are filed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, under numbers 213 and 2765 of District 164, file numbers 12969 and 36046, years 1945 and 1946, respectively.

Considering and analysing the evidence in this case, the Court, by the present, declares the application made by the petitioner to be in order and orders the Bureau of Demographic Registry and Statistics of the Department of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to proceed with the correction of the petitioner's first name in order that it appear on his birth certificate with his true first name of Manuel and in order that his two aforementioned minor sons appear in their respective birth certificate with the paternal surname Marti, and also to correct the name of the father of the said minors so that it appears as Manuel Marti instead of Adrian Sotomayor; all this in accordance with what is set forth in Law 119, approved on 26 April 1950.

Given in San Juan, Puerto Rico, today the 12th day of February 1963.

/signed/
Antonio R. Barcelo,
Judge

# OCCURRENCE:
In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem and that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid (as proposed in a paper prepared by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the President should be well informed of any steps taken in this context such as the instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.

OCCURRENCE: On or about October 5, 1963 when the telegram of October 5 and 6 were sent to Saigon, MC CONE was called over by PRESIDENT KENNEDY and met privately with PRESIDENT KENNEDY and the Attorney General, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and took the position that the CIA should take a hands off position as far as the assassination of DIEM was concerned. MC CONE "felt that the President agreed with my position, despite the fact that he had great reservations concerning DIEM and his conduct. I urged him to try to bring all the pressure we could on DIEM to change his ways, to encourage more support throughout the country. My precise words to the President, and I remember them very clearly, was that Mr. President, if I was manager of a baseball team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the box whether he was a good pitcher or not. By that I was saying that, if DIEM was removed we would have not one coup, but we would have a succession of coups and political disorder in Vietnam, and it might last several years as indeed it did. So it was for that reason that I felt there would be

In general best line is no line so that it is clear that we are sticking to position of having no responsibility for actions of any of various contending Vietnamese groups. We certainly cannot be in the position of stimulating, approving, or supporting assassination, but on the other hand, we are in no way responsible for stopping every such threat of which we might receive even partial knowledge. We certainly would not favor assassination of DIEM. We believe in gaging ourselves by taking position on this matter opens door too easily for probes of our position re others, re support of regime, etc. Consequently, believe best approach is hands off. However, we naturally interested in intelligence on any such plan. This message has been cleared with State Department."

He did not want the U.S. government to start the coup d'etat. He also outlined three general ideas, this was the first time that a leader had mentioned the possibility of assassination. This assassination was not of DIEM. This was if they could not do anything, it would be the elimination of NGO DINH CAN, who was the war lord in central Vietnam and NGO DINH NHU. At that time GENERAL MINH did say that one of the alternative means was to eliminate CAN and NHU and keep DIEM." That was one of the alternatives. p. 25

Faced with this information and given strictly limited time factors, RICHARDSON decided that the meeting with GENERALS MINH and KHIEM should not be postponed but that contacting officers would make this meeting a fact-finding mission without encouraging or discouraging GENERAL MINH.

OCCURRENCE:

The I.G. REPORT of 1967 (CIA) contains the following description of the events of August 25, 1963, from a book by MARGUERITE HIGGINS: "The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek tragedy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to Saigon late in the evening of August 24, 1963, a date made more significant because it was a Saturday. Washington usually empties on summer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation."

"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.S. EMBASSY in SAIGON. It was drawn up at a meeting called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRIMAN and ROGER HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task force. The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIRECTOR JOHN McCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation. (con't)

SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK was attending a baseball game in New York. PRESIDENT KENNEDY was at Hyannis Port. GENERAL TAYLOR says he knew nothing of the meeting until it was over and the telegram long on its way.

"... the cable proved historic. For the first time it gave the signal to 'unleash' the Vietnamese military, flashed a green light for the coup against DIEM of which the generals had been talking for so many years."

"... the cable of August 24 was a radical revision of the previous philosophy of one war at a time. It envisaged the generals' making war on their own government, and with the implicit blessing of the United States."

"The substance of the cable was that the U.S. EMBASSY was to make an effort (con't.)

Higgins states that the Xa Loi pagoda, based on her own experiences, was more a political command post than a holy place. It was the headquarters from which the militant Thich Tri Quang and others had run their political war against the Diem regime. According to Higgins, Thich Tri Quang told an Austrian journalist by the name of Denis Warner early in August that he hoped in the process "they would kill one or two of us."
Higgins goes on to note that the State Department regarded the actions against a dozen pagodas a betrayal of Diem's promise to reconciliate the Buddhists. (Page 181)

Higgins claims that "...the raids by the Vietnamese Army and the pagodas took place five days after the departure of Ambassador Milting from Saigon, and a week before Henry Cabot Lodge was expected to arrive on his first tour of duty in Viet Nam." Higgins goes on to explain that Diem claimed that the reason that the raids were performed at this time was because: "It had become clear that Thich Tri Quang of Buddhist was that no intention of coming to any agreement with the government, irrespective of how many consessions were made. Since the raids would create an anti-Diem propaganda explosion, it would be less embarrassingto the United States if they took place when the new Ambassador was *not President* of Vietnam. For the same reason, great care was taken not to inform the United States of the pagoda plans. The reasoning was that Washington could be blamed for something about which if knew nothing."

OCCURRENCE: The initial conscious decision and agreement among the coup principals occurred before General Duong Van Minh has been the indubitable leader of the coup principals from the outset. General Tran Van Don has been General Minh's deputy and principal officer to coordinate civilian officers and unit commanders. Major General Le Van Kim, probably the most intelligent of the conspirators, has been responsible for aligning nationalist opposition parties and for developing political planning. General Tran Thien Khiem's role was to issue necessary orders and to act as Chief of Staff to General Minh during the plotting of the coup and the actual coup.

One of the main factors that affected the coup was the decision to eliminate or keep President Diem. The majority of the officers, including General Minh, desired President Diem to have honorable retirement from the political scene in South Vietnam and exile. As to Ngo Dinh Nhu and Ngo Dinh Can, there was never dissension. The attitude was that their deaths, along with Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, would be welcomed.

We do not think the Communists would necessarily profit if he were overthrown by some combination of his non-Communist opponents. A non-Communist successor regime might be initially less effective against the Viet Cong, but, given continued support from the U. S., could provide reasonably effective leadership for the government and the war effort." (1-2)

OCCURRENCE: Diem on May 6, 1963 revived a regulation banning the public display of any religious flag--either the Buddhist or Catholic-- having any precedence over the National Vietnamese flag in public places or in public view. Higgins does not doubt that the Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6, 1963 made possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been generally viewed as anti- Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earlier in Da Nang by the excessive use by Catholics of the flag of the vatican with the National Vietnamese flag on view being sometimes tattered and torn and few in number.

OCCURRENCE: CONEIN stated that the catalyst that brought down the DIEM regime was their antagonism of the Buddhists. He explained that 80% of the Vietnamese people claimed to be Buddhists. And that DIEM led a Catholic regime and that this drove people, particularly in light of MADAME NHU's statements to the effect that she'd like to furnish some mustard at a bonzes barbecue, or something to that effect. This made people want to identify themselve:: against the regime and so they would go back to the pagodas. CONEIN did not know whether or not this became the principal reason for the United States wanting to get rid of the regime. pp. 42-44.

(Ambassador Nolting was on a Meditterranean vaction at the time.)

"According to Mecklin, William Trueheart, the Charge d'Affaires, applied on orders from Washington, 'direct, relentless, tablehammering pressure on Diem such as the United States had seldom before attempted with a sovereign friendly government...' In despair Trueheart in June resorted to a formal warning to Diem that if he continued repressive measures (police effort to prevent and disperse illegal demonstrations), the United States would be forced to disassociate itself publicly from such actions, as indeed we did two months later. The warning was a momentous step. It amounted to a direct official command from (continued next card).

OCCURRENCE: CONEIN stated that the attacks in May in Hue followed up by an attack in Augus on the pagodas in Saigon consolidated the three or four different sects of the Buddhists by making them become a political entity which they had never been before. CONEIN stated that it had become obvious to people in the State Department, USAID and JUSPAU, as well as persons within the CIA and the country team generally, that the true power of the government at that time was not DIEM but rather NHU and CAN, as well as MADAME NHU, the chief of the womens' solidarity movement. DIEM was felt to be out of touch with reality and not getting the true facts as everything was being channeled through his brother, NHU. pp. 44-45

OCCURRENCE: CONEIN said that the DIEM government started the Buddhist antagonism but could not understand their doing so. He gave his personal opinion as that "they had a chance to get out of it and get out of it very gracefully within the first two weeks after the 8th of May incident in HUE by meeting the demands of paying off the families of those people who were killed when the military attacked the pagodas in Hue. If this would have been done, I think that we would have been much better off....This was a turning point of the political situation....". pp. 41-42

OCCURRENCE:
"Immediately after May 8, President Diem ordered a formal investigation of the Hue affairs. For this purpose he appointed a 3-man technical commission led by Major General Tran Van Don, the acting head of the army (General Don was considered a man of integrity by the Americans.)" The commission also included the Surgeon General of the Vietnamese Army and its Chief of Ordinance. After extensive interrogation of witnesses General Don's mission cited plastic charges as the cause of the deaths on May 8.

"At the time, nonetheless, Diem's regime claimed that plastic bombs caused the deaths was widely ridiculed."

"Unfortunately, no American officials were witness to the incidence. The American consul had been out of town but he tended to disbelieve the government's efforts to place (continued) the blame on Viet Cong plastics. He felt that the American supplied grenades were responsible for the killings." (96)

OCCURRENCE:
Nguyen Van Bang later at the trial of Major Dang Sy said that "While we were inside, two loud explosions suddenly reverberated on the veranda. Then came the sounds of broken glass, gunshots, and exploding hand grenades." In the confusion Major Dang Sy heard the explosions also and in attempting to signal what he feared may be a Viet Cong attack fired three shots in the air. Unfortunately this was the prearranged signal authorizing his troops to use grenades to disperse the crowds. At least 15 of these grenades were throw and the explosions caused at least 8 dead at the radio station. (95) This statement though, appears to be in conflict with later medical evidence coming from the Interior Minister which found that none of the bodies of the dead had metal splinters in their organs, but rather the weapons expert said that the bombs were probably made of plastic and that "plastic is the arm of the Viet Cong guerilla."

OCCURRENCE: According to Higgins on May 8, 1963 on the Buddhist birthday Thich Tri Quang, in the middle of a religious ceremony, began to give a vitriolic anti-government speech on the subject of the non-existent ban on Buddhist flags. About 8 pm Thich Tri Quang arrived at the radio station carrying in his hands a tape recording which he then made the demand upon the director of the station to play. He was refused. Thich Tri Quang proceeded to encourage an already active angry crowd which in the middle of this oration began to shout and press forward. The director of the station called up Nguyen Van Bang who soon arrived and attempted to appease Thich Tri Quang, but the latter would not listen. Nguyen Van Bang then asked for armored cars in hopes that this would fighten the crowd and prevent any violence to the radio station. Major Dang Sy then arrived with some armored cars and got some general orders to disperse the crowd. Police arrived and attempted to turn fire hoses on the crowd. (93-94)

If there had been, assuredly the critics of Diem's leadership would have trumpeted it to the world. Complaints of alleged religious repression made by Thich Tri Quant and his accomplices in a campaign of letters to the United Nations and prominent foreigners, had begun, but they represented no more than the early activity of determined propagandists.

Most hostile criticism toward Diem centered not on what he did but on his methods and techniques of governing."

"The idea of removing Nhu From Vietnam was one that was discussed in great detail and a great deal of pressure was put on Diem to send his brother out of the country." "At one point I made a suggestion that perhaps I could convince him of the desirability of leaving the country for the benefit of is own, of the country itself. That I could go over and argue him into.(t) That I think is the separable thing from the actual decision to shoot Diem. I think the decision to shoot Diem was a conscience decision taken by the Generals which came as a very new development during the coup, bat let's face it is something you have to anticipato may taken an overthrow of a government."

officer, a small armored unit to pick him up after they found out where he was down in the

officer, a young Vietnamese who was an aide to GENERAL MINH, head of the coup group, and
they went into the armored personnel carrier and when the carrier arrived back at head-
quarters, the two were dead and had been shot several times. That officer, incidentally,
and a rather bizarre aspect of this, was himself apparently when this junta of generals
was overthrown about two months later. Somebody took that occasion to shoot him."

OCCURRENCE:
The Diem circular to ban all religious flags reached Hue on May 7, 1963.
Since the city was already bedecked with flags the Vietnamese Minister of Interior,
Vui Van Long, arriving in Hue on the same date as the circular arrived went to the Bud-
dhist leaders and explained that the flag regulation would not be enforced. "The leaders
of the monks were very pleased," said Minister Long. "They listened to me and told me
that I had given complete satisfaction to their desires Quang was present during this
exchange and joined in expressing satisfaction with the arrangement not to enforce
the regulation. Some police in Hue did take down flags before the Province Chief could
reverse the order to enforce the regulation. But the precipitating factor, according
to Higgins was that Kuang sent a few monks around to tell the people to haul down the
flags, even though he knew this was no longer required, thanks to the Interior Ministers
actions. "The monks were told to tell the population that this was being done as a
result of Diem's order to ban the Buddhist flag. (91-92)

It was agreed that Defense make certain equipment and personnel available to CIA in support
of this program. An elint flight designed to identify the North Vietnamese radar order of

Elections were far from free and many of the devices used to stimulate popular support for the regime bore the the familiar stamp of modern totalitarian practice. No doubt these moves could be justified, at least to some extent, in terms of the overwhelming problems confronting Diem during his first few years in office and also the inexperience of Free Viet Nam's people with the forms and substance of democracy, but...Diem had still to prove that his professed devotion to the democratic cause represented anything more than a facade to disguise increasingly plain reality of stern dictatorship."

We returned quite late the night of the 7th; though I wanted to stay, the MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR told me it would be impossible. I wanted to see the celebration of the birthday of Budda. I wanted to see burnt boats with the candles lit going down the perfumed river, but it was not to be. The next day there was an attack by the military forces on the Buddhists. At that time, the Buddhists as an entity was not a political force and therefore thought of being, and when the attack on the Buddhist came about, this was, in my estimation, one of the turning points in what was happening in.

Unfortunately, the officer, a Major (2nd) Thien (phonetic), who had the mission to escort Captain Ho Tan Quyen, Commanding Officer of the Naval Forces, killed the Captain prior to 1200 hours. This nearly upset the timing of the plan. Fortunately, he was driven directly to the Military Hospital and no one knew of his death except the coup principals and the contour loyal to them.

OCCURRENCE:
Higgins notes that Kennedy dispatched Krulik and Mendenhall to Viet Nam to make a tour of
the country to determine the effect of the Buddhist crisis on the war against the Viet
Cong. Returning to Washington, Krulik and Mendenhall each gave a different report on the
effect. Higgins notes that Kennedy asked wryly, "llave you two fellows been in the same
country?" Higgins goes on to note that this was indeed indicative of the American reac-
tion to Vietnam generally. Krulik, Higgins points out, visited the theatre of war by go-
ing to all core areas as well as six divisional and some twenty-five regimental and bat-
talion headquarters. But Mendenhall saw the theatre of the political intrigue, i.e.,
Hue in Saigon. These latter two areas was the only Viet Nam that Americans knew during
that time, and it was the slightly Effett, volital society which was the haven of Viet
Nam's chronically critical and bickering intellectuals. Pages 104-105)

OCCURRENCE:
COLBY stated that the United States sought to put pressure on President DIEM and the government, particularly to remove NGO DINH NHU from the country, to bring about certain changes of policy in August of 1963 that was thought necessary to improve the performance of the government of South Vietnam. Among these were the suspension of Public Law 480 aid the suspension of the commodity import program. And also through various contacts with dissident generals, the United States was requested whether it would stand aside if the generals ran their own coup, and they were given the response in general terms that, "Yes, we would stand aside, and yes, we would continue the aid program if a successor government took over and looked reasonably able to carry on the war. This can only be read as a green light to the generals. This message was passed through a CIA officer, but his credentials were checked by the generals receiving this kind of a message, with the Ambassador and with the Chief of the Military Aid group in Saigon so that there was no question about what U.S. policy was, nor that the CI officer was speaking for the Ambassador with his knowledge and consent."

COLBY stated that DIEM went out and supressed this kind of active dissidence, justifying it in his mind and publicly as not accepting this kind of dissidence during a wartime situation, which that country was faced with. COLBY claimed that this suppression only served to adversely affect DIEM's image here in the United States and intensify the feeling of dissent within the educated class in Saigon and in the cities, weakened himself, rather than strengthen himself.

I know there are American officials who are preparing the way in the event the decision is taken to try and get rid of me. I cannot forsee the future. And I cannot believe that America would turn against an ally under attack, engaged in a struggle for its very existence. But some people are crazy--and the world is crazy. Still, Miss Higgins, I hope that your government will take a realistic look at these young generals plotting to take my place. How much maturity or political understanding do they have--of their own country, let alone the world?" (169)

Milting told Higgins that "Our report shows that the Buddhist crisis is not having any impact at all--though, of course, it could if riots become severe enough to necessitate diverting front-line troups."

"We have made a special check," the Ambassador continued, "of the rumor that Buddhist and Catholics are eating apart an Army messes. Nothing to it. I don't know what Hilsman based this statement on. But he isn't basing it on anything that went out of his Embassy, the military mission, or the CIA." Mechlin suggested to Milting that perhaps he should not publicly deny Hilsman's comment as Hilsman was, after all, Milting's boss."

Such a group might not prove able to salvage the situation and, indeed, might eventually prove no better than the present regime. Such a development would, however, enable the US and anti-Communist nationalist elements to make a fresh start unencumbered and unhampered by political errors of past years, months, and weeks.

OCCURRENCE:

In a State telegram to Saigon (DEPTEL 256), on August 27, 1963, the following message appeared:

"Examination of reports to date gives considerable hope but leaves unanswered questions. Proceeding from the concept outlined in DEPTEL 243 as modified, now desire your prompt interim appraisal of present prospects. . . . Highest authority asks whether you and HARKINS, in light of developing situation, presently favor operation as currently planned by generals. We wish to give you all possible support in best available course but not to insist on any decision that developing evidence makes it wise to modify." (10)

At a NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE meeting on Vietnam on August 29, 1963, with a record taken by DD/P HELMS, shows that

The consensus was that HARKINS should confirm to the generals that the approaches from CIA were bona fide and represented the views of the US government. There was agreement that better information was needed on what the generals were in fact planning to do and whether it was militarily feasible. A telegram giving the sense of the meeting was drafted for "PRESIDENTIAL approval." (12)

"RUSK referred to recent cable traffic and said that he was not even sure whom we were dealing with or what they were planning. McNAMARA pointed out that there was some question whether the generals ever did have a plan. BUNDY said he had re-read the earlier traffic and noted that they never said they did. GEN. CARTER said he believed that the general's coup was not likely at this stage and that in another week we will be approximately where we were before the attack on the Buddhist temples. BUNDY suggested we consider additional contingencies before the GROUP and whether the assumption that NHU is impossible is well founded." (13)

GENERAL HARKINS was authorized to meet with KHIEM to give KHIEM assurances of USG backing. KHIEM showed a reluctance to talk and suggested that HARKINS meet with GENERAL MINH. KHIEM commented that MINH had called off the planning and was working on other methods which KHIEM would not describe. KHIEM further stated that the generals were not ready as they did not have enough forces under their control. HARKINS decided not to give KHIEM assurances which he had been authorized to impart. LODGE approved HARKINS' decision on 31 August after HARKINS reported." (13)

So on November 1 at 1 p.m. in the afternoon when troops were moving it was assumed by Diem and Nhu that this was part of Diem's plan to have a counter-coup. Page 66-68.

After the deadlines had passed and DINH had not received what he thought was his proper recognition, GENERAL DON and other officers including HUAN continued to lend sympathy to DINH while DINH was still waiting for his ministerial post. p. 13

In a CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 0523),/the I.G. REPORT provides the following summary:

"RICHARDSON cabled a damage assessment. He concluded that DIEM and the NHU's are fully aware that the USG encouraged the GENERALS to attempt a coup and that CIA was the instrumentality of this encouragement. He judged there was an even possibility that all major programs could go forward as in the past. He listed as a major dilemma the Stations future relationships with COL. TUNG. He noted his dissatisfaction with TUNG as a GVN liaison vehicle through which to conduct PM programs, but noted that the GVN had offered no alternative. Unless we were willing to discontinue our NVN, Laos border, and cross-border programs, we must continue to work with TUNG. [NOTE: PM programs = paramilitary programs]
"The Times of Vietnam published charges that the CIA was plotting and financing a coup and was giving asylum to the chief anti-DIEM Buddhist leader. The story was picked up and widely played by the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, and other prominent newspapers." (15-16)

General GroTeck reported his findings in Vietnam. His conclusions were that the war was going ahead at an impressive pace and that the Vietcong war could be won if current U.S. military and socological, programs are continued. Mendenhall, the Ştate representative who accompanied Celack, expressed the view that there was complete breakdown of the Siagon civilian government in the security situations in the provinces had deteriorated. The President asked where the two gentlemen had been insame country. Rusk suggested that the focus be on what happened in July and August that reversed the optimistic judgments in May and June. Mr. McCone talked from a personal telegram which he had received Richardson recommending against any cut in aid.

McNamarra stated that his position was virouously against throwing out this government without seeing an alternative and that none appeared to exist. Mr. McCone commented that the problem was not so much the existance of an alternative as to how to put one into power.

(as proposed in a paper prepared by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsıran paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the PresidesDURE Bould be well informed of any steps taken in this contextTAFFsuch as the instance involving CIA navment to Col Tung last week.

In a CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG0922) of 16 September 1963 Richardson replied to Washington's requestfor his judgment on the desirability and feasibility of certain ideas, as Washington was then in the course of constructing an agreed plan. He cabled: "We must go on trying to win the war with current administration for as long as it persists in power (we should not attempt publicly to achieve objectives with respect to GVN with probability of attainment is virtually nil) we cannot covertly tinker with or engineer coup unless general situation is reasonably perpitious and if we are unable to establish necessary working contact with Vietnamese leaders willing and able to do the job with necessary means. (Agree we should carefully explore and perhaps carefully experiment with graduated measures designed to pressure Diem, within context of persuading him to take steps needed. These measures would be more effeftive if they are limited to practical and acheivable objectives.)"

# OCCURRENCE:
DINH's desire to become a Minister was greater than his allegiance to President DIEM. He became the actual key to the success of the coup. His facile, and at times brilliant mind, was used to the general's advantage in that GENERAL DINH convinced President DIEM that he, General DINH, along with COLONEL TUNG, should be given blanket orders to be a counter-coup force. "DINH also convinced TUNG to move four of his principal airborne companies on a bootless operation outside of Saigon on 29 and 30 October, so that these troops would not be present on 1 November. DINH is the Minister of Security in the provisional government. p. 13

planning the coup, and to get as much information so that our government would not be caught
with their pants down. He did agree not to thwart the coup and in fact, to supply economic

couragement or the promotion of the coup, nor did he ever discuss the possibility of dis-
couraging the coup. CONEIN stated that if the United States had now shown any interest or
remained neutral in opposing DIEM, there would have been a coup anyway. pp. 38-41

evident from statements during the series of meetings with GENERAL DON and GENERAL MINH dur-

him sufficiently with his troops, and, if necessary to eliminate DINH if he showed any sign
of compromising the generals. DINH was surrounded by officers who surveilled him 24 hours a

The meeting was held to discuss matters that became the subject of DEPTEL 5/34 (See later entry of 5 October.) DCI said it was the opinion of CIA with the exception of Colby, Chief Fareast Division, that fiddling with the commodity import program as a political lever would be much more likely to create an economic crisis undermining the war effort than to scare Diem and Nhu into a more cocperative attitude, because it would seriously affect the confidence and planning of the Vietnamese business community and quickly engender inflationary measures at large of a more serious nature. It was the concensus of the meeting that some meaningful political movements had to be made but exactly what they should be was not determined.

He said he did not expect U.S.G. support of a coup effort but did need USG assurances that USG would not try to thwart his plans. He outlined three possible plans for the accomplishment of the change of government: (a) assassinationof Ngo Din Nhu and Ngo Dinh Cin, keeping President Diem in office; (b) encirclement of Saigon by various military units; and (c) direct confrontation between military units involved in the coup and loyalist military units.

### OCCURRENCE:
MC CONE recalled a meeting with President KENNEDY and Attorney General ROBERT F. KENNEDY had with him on or about October 5 or 6, 1963. The Attorney General was rather non-committal in the meeting. He and I walked downstairs together, and he said, "John, are you sure you are right?" And I said, "I think I am" and he said "I'm rather surprised at the position you took." And I said, "well, you didn't disagree with it..." (T) This discussion had nothing to do with assassinations. This was whether we should let the coup go or use our influences not to. Then interestingly enough, the President sent a series of messages to CABOT LODGE urging that he'd do all that he could to get DIEM to change his ways. CABOT LODGE's first attempt failed and then he was called -- CABOT LODGE was called by DIEM's office and DIEM said, "you tell the President to tell me what he wants me to do and I'll do it." Unfortunately, the forces were surrounding the palace at that very moment and the coup was on. It was a kind of a dramatic little part of the history of that tragedy."

And the response on 6 October 1963 which COLBY wrote for MC CONE as follows: "MC CONE directs that you withdraw recommendation to Ambassador concerning assassination plan under MC CONE instructions as we cannot be in a position to actively condone such course of action thereby endangering our responsibility, therefore COLBY explained that this second message he drafted was to eliminate assassination as an alternative. COLBY stated that the assassination of DIEM's other brothers NHU and KAHN, NGO DINH KAHN, were to continue. A reply was sent on October 7 from Saigon in response to the MC CONE cable saying that action was taken as directed, meaning that the Ambassador had been so informed to withdraw the recommendation."

OCCURRENCE:
On 8 September 1963, the CIA IG report reflects in a comment that the U.S. government publicly confirmed on Oct. 8, 1963 that aid had already been cut quitely and over a period of some months. Bill Colby, Jock Anderson and Dave Smith told us that the public announcement of the aid reduction was a signal to the general and that the reduction was planned with that in mind. It may be that the cut in aid was deliberately planned to spur the generals on, but if so, that intention did not find its way into the record. The nearest thing to it is in the record of a presidential meeting of 10 September 1963. The President asked Rufus Phillips of AID what specific actions Phillips recommended and he suggested "cutting aid to Colonel Tung which would be viewed by the generals with much enthusiasm as an indication of virgouous of American position." In general, ald cuts were discussed in terms of bring pressure on Diem to make needed changes in his regime. However planned, or however looked upon by the U. S. administration, it is clear that the Vietnamese considered the official confirmation of aid cut as a clear token of their support of coup planning.

OCCURRENCE: In the latter part of October, CONEIN stated, the people in Washington figured that CONEIN was being set up as "patsy" and that this would be highly embarrassing for the U.S. government in case he was found out to have been set up. Therefore, the people in Washington made recommendations that somebody more senior to him and with extensive military background should take over from him. When Washington then sent a message to Ambassador LODGE and recommended that a capable officer and a personal friend of CONEIN'S, GENERAL STILWELL take over, GENERAL DON and the coup members said, no, we trust CONEIN, we don't want anybody else. pp. 31-32

In an October 28, 1963 entry in the Saigon station "History of the Vietnames Generals Coup" it is noted that: CONEIN met with Genral DON for the last time before the coup was launched. DON confirmed he had talked with the Ambassador who had vouched for CONEIN. DON stated that he was leaving on 29 October to coordinate final plans. DON requested CONEIN to remain at home until 30 October -- until further notice. DON repeated that the Ambassador would have the plans before the coup began, but when pressed on his previous commitment to make them available, 48 hours in advance, DON said that possiblythe hours would only be made available 4 hours in advance. DON said that nothing would be happening within the next 48 hours and that, if there was a good reason for the ambassador to change his planned 31 October departure, the Ambassador would be informed in time to make his own decision.

Upon arriving at JGS headquarters, CONEIN was told by GENERAL DON that DON had tried unsuccessfully to reach CONEIN earlier by telephone. A later check revealed that CONEIN's telephone was out of order. CONEIN was told that he was to keep a telephone line open to the Ambassador. Because there was a CIA officer on the scene and in intimate contact with the coup principals, the STATION was able to report almost minute-by-minute progress of the coup."

OCCURRENCE:
COLBY states that "When CONEIN was told by the generals, GENERAL MINH, that the NHU brothers, DIEM and NHU, had committed suicide, CONEIN thought it incredible on its face. This was because both brothers were very strong Catholics and CONEIN doubted that they would have done such a thing. According to COLBY, CONEIN was offered a chance to look at the bodies but turned it down. In trying to reconstruct the period of the assassination on November 1, COLBY reports that there was a telephone conversation between President DIEM and the generals. In fact there were several of them. President DIEM was very strongly rejecting the generals, calling them to discipline, and so forth, in the early stages. At a later stage, in the early morning of November 1, he called and indicated that he would surrender if he would be properly handled. The generals then sent somebody down to receive that surrender and found that President DIEM was not there. He'd actually gotten out through the back door of the palace and had gone down to another section of the city. SOURCE: CONEIN was not in attendance."

In retrospect, one must realize that there was, however, considerable debate about encouraging and supporting the generals in an overthrow of the DIEM regime, and that the record is very clear that the United States through its overall policy was in support of that overthrow and, of course, I think it is fair to say that in launching a violent overthrow of a regime involved such as this, people are going to get hurt, and in this case, the leaders we killed in the process." pp. 19-20

Then this did not materialize by early October, the coup principals realized that they had Dinh actively thinking against the regime. It is evident from statements during the series of meetings with General Ton and General Minh during the month of October that they still did not trust Dinh but felt they had compromised him sufficiently to use his troops and, if necessary, to eliminate Dinh if he showed any sign of compromising the generals. Dinh was surrounded by officers who surveilled him 24 hours a day including Colonel Co, his deputy, now IV Corps Commander and newly promoted to Brigadier General.

In addition to the above maneuvering, Colonel Do Mau, (now Brigadier General), Chief of Military Security Service, played his role by issuing false military intelligence reports which went to President Diem. These reports started on or about 24 October and built up a picture of strong Viet Cong forces approaching Saigon for attack and permitted the Joint General Staff to issue appropriate orders, approved by the President, to move units favorable to the conspiracy to the outskirts of Saigon and also to move units, such as the Special Forces, away from Saigon.

Colby stated that although he did not have the copy there was a telegram which recounts a call made from Diem to Lodge on the afternoon of the coup. Diem said that he was having trouble "...an effort was being made against him by his Generals, and that he believed it essential to put this down. He urged that the U. S. consult General Lansdale and me (Colby) by name because we understood something about this situation. This was in the afternoon of the coup. The response, I believe, Ambassador Lodge did mention something about assistance in leaving the country." Pages 49-50.

DON has made it clear many times that this is a Vietnamese affair...... I believe we should continue our present position of keeping hands off but continue to monitor and press for more detailed information. CAS has been anaylzing forces for some time and it is their estimate that the generals have probably figured their chances pretty closely....... It does not seem sensible to have the military in charge of matter which is so profoundly political as a change of govern-ment.... As to requests from the generals, they may well have need of funds at the last moment with which to buy off potential opposition. To the extent that these funds can be passed discreetly, I believe we should furnish them.... If we were convinced that the coup was going to fail, we would of course do everything we could to stop it. HARKINS has read

quotation appeared: "....We do not accept as a basis for U.S. policy that we have no power
to delay or discourage coup....We cannot limit ourselves to proposition implied in your
message that only conviction of certain failure justifies intervention....U.S. authorities
will reject appeals for direct intervention from either side.... " (the IG Report here
states without further showing the author of the above message that "the White House re-
peats its instructions on command of the country team after LODGE leaves." The inference
can probably be drawn that the message although looked upon as a CIA cable to Saigon, it
was undoubtedly emanating from the White House.)

The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy ev idence.

5. Several days before the coup was to take place, General Don coordinated the final plan with Generals Do Cao Tri and Nguyen Khanh and with the Commanding Officer of the Military Academy at Dalat. The signal to start the coup was based on a previous decree issued by President Diem which stated that after 1 November there could be no siesta and there would be only a one-hour lunch period. By radio and telephone, the coup principals had issued instructions to coup participants that as of 1 November working hours would begin at 1330. Starting at 0730 hours 1 November the instructions were transcribed to units furthest away from Saigon, i.e., Hue, and in sufficient time so that the forces which were to attack Saigon

PERSONS/ENTITIES:
KHANH
MAJOR DANG SY

DATES:
Jan. 1964

CATEGORIES:
DIEM

OCCURRENCE:
At the trial of Dang Sy by the Khanh regime that succeeded that of the coup leaders temporary or provisional government, Khanh's prosecutor insisted that the deaths had been caused by American-supplied grenades of the type known as MKIII whose use had been ordered by Dang Sy, and the conviction by the military court was that the 8 deaths were caused by these concussion grenades. Higgins argues in her book that this conviction is contrary to the Pentagon's assessment of the MKIII grenade which found that at worst the effects of such a grenade are non-fatal. Nor does such a grenade have sufficient force to decapitate or mutilate persons, let alone bring down the ceilings, doors, and windows that were adjacent to the veranda of the radio station. (95-96) Higgins also states that: "The conviction of Major Dang Sy certainly throws no light on the matter one way or another. The trial was clearly rigged from the start." (96-97)

OCCURRENCE: COLBY stated in response to the difficulty for the United States once it has sought to accomplish objectives through foreign nationalists to control the actions of the foreign nationalists, that "Certainly the foreigner makes his own decisions at various ti the degree to which he is going to do one thing or the other. The U.S. cannot control it. The U. S. can assist them, the U.S. can counsel him and advise him, perhaps influence him, but the control, that is....when you are dealing with essentially another soverign, why ti are limits to your degree of authority over them." p. 76

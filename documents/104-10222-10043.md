NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in currant position keeping in proper perspective their relationship is overall performance. State suggestions made for Improvement of work performance, recommendations for training. Corament on foreign languago competence, if required for currant position. Amplify or explain ratings given In Section B to provide bet basis for determining future personnel action. Manger of performance of managerial or wiat or supervisory duties must be descrinat, il applicable. As explained in the previous fitness report, Jubject was assigned to the station for the purpose of taking charge of the Station's joint telephone tap center, a position for which he was and is eminently qualified by reason of extensive experience and outstanding language qualifications. However, this position did not materialize because of circumstances beyond the control of Subject and the station.

It was therefore subsequently decided to train Subject locally, and have his gradually assume case officer and analyst responsibilities in certain simpler aspects of the Station's Soviet program.

Given the circumstances that Subject had not had prior case officer or analytical experience (or even any substantial past exposure to operations to give him vicarious experience) he progressed more than adequately in absorbing the training offered, in assuming responsibility for two Soviet operations and in the preparation of analytical studies on the Soviet complement. Given the further circumstances that the Station 414 not have the time to train him more than superficially, and that the operations he handled were basically uncomplicated, it must be stated that Subject cannot now be considered to be a case officer..

This conscientious and intelligent officer has high interest and enthusiasm for operations, but it is believed that his forte and future lies in the management of technical operations. This has been recognized also by Headquarters in the assignzent presently planned for him.

As a staff agent under tourist cover, he and his family adapted themselves remarkably well to the deep cover situation and to all other environmental factors.

SECTION C

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths of weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

From the time of Subject's arrival in Mexico and through December 1963, he was utilized principally in translation work and was held on tap the position of heading up the Station's joint telephone tap center. Circumstances beyond the control of the Station and Subject are responsible for the fact that the incumbent in charge of the center will continue these duties and Subject will be given other responsibilities.

Primarily, Subject will be trained to handle analyst and case officer responsibilities in the Soviet field. The level and range of the responsibilities will depend on the progress Subject makes in handling these duties in a manner satisfactory to the Station.

Subject is most conscientious and effective in every assignment given him to date, and the Station is extremely pleased to have him available as an outside Station asset. He is enthusiastic about all his work, including certain part-time routine and arduous duties, and he looks forward with confidence to the prospect of becoming a case officer. Although it is premature to state positively that Subject will succeed as a case officer, the supervisor believes that Subject will undoubtedly progress adequately.

Subject and his family have acclimated themselves excellently to the deep cover situation, faster than most of the Station's other staff agents, and certainly with fewer problems and requests for guidance from the Station's staff.

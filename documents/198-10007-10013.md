e. Partly as a result of the efforts of the CIA
station in Santiago, the Government of Chile prohibited the
entry into Chile of organizers of the Cuban sponsored Second
Latin American Youth Congress, which had been scheduled to take
place in Santiago in August. This was one of the factors which
led to postponement of theCongress.

f. After considerable prodding by the CIA Station
and the Embassy the Minister of Public Security of Costa Rica
has presented legislative proposals to the Costa Rican Assembly
which will require all persons intending to travel to Communist
countries to have their travel approved by a newly created
Costa Rican security agency.

g. CIA Station in Mexico City developed information
concerning the clandestine arrival of passengers in Vera Crua
on Cuban merchant ships. Efforts are being made to obtain more
information and to encourage stricter controls by the Nexican
authorities.

Department of State

a. Instructed Embassy Conakry to try to persuade
Guinean authorities to deny use of airport facilities by flights
on Habana-Moscon route. These efforts achieved a temporary
withholding of permission for future regular flighte, at least

until such time as the Soviets develop their own refueling facilities at Conakry.

b. Instructed Embassy Rio to approach Brazilian authorities to express our deep concern at the growing frequency of Cuban non-scheduled flights to Brazil and request their cooperation in curbing then. Also instructed our Embassies in several Latin American countries to work with CIA station chiefs in furnishing the names of nationals of those countries travelling on these flights to local authorities and urging then: (1) to institute tighter controle on their own citizens travelling to Cuba, and (2) to express their concern to the Brazil'Over Cuban use of Brazil as a way station

for transporting subversives.

c. As a result of representacions made to the British government about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands carrying Latin American subversives, the British developed an administrative scheme which will effectively prohibit the use of British Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit points for passengers..
The British intend to require transit visas of passengers passing through their areas, and to reject applications for such visas except in certain special cases. Persons not possessing visas would be prevented from leaving their aircraft, or would be

returned to their point of origin.

d. Instructed Embassy Mexico City on August 29 to inform the Hexican airline QA that the United States is opposed to a proposal that CMA operate charter flights to carry refugees from Havana to Central America. 24, as a result, stated that they had no intention of proceeding further with this project.

e. Instructed U.S. Nissions in Curaces and the la gue to investigate a report that KIM was planning to renew eb scheduled Curacao-Habana flights and to reiterate US opposition to resumption of air service to Cuba, KIM assured our Embassy that there is no plan to initiate service, scheduled or non-scheduled, co Habans.

f. Instructed Embassy Ottava to express our strong objections to a proposal that a Cubang charter flight pick up a second group of U.S. students in Montreal to fly then to Cuba, The flight was not authorized.

g. Instructed Consulate Georgetown to investigato Cubang approaches to secure flight facilities. Mesion reported on August 1 that the Governor bad no knowledge of any talks between the B.G.

Indicated his intention to inquire further and to keep us advised. London reported that neither the Cuban nor the British Guiana Governments had raised the issue of landing rights with H.M.G.

h. Urged the governments of Mexico, Canada, Jamaica and the Netherlands to refuse to assist the Cuban government in its efforts to find a short route for return of the 30 American students who illegally travelled to Cuba. Also informed Pan American Airways that we were opposed to a Cuban request for a PAA charter flight to fly the students from Habana to New York.

i. Instructed our missions at Port of Spain and Barbados on several occasions to approach these governments to express the concern of the U.S. at indications of Cuban interest in the use of their aviation facilities.

Embassy Port of Spain discussed with the Foreign Secretary of Trinidad various legal moves available that would enable COTT to control movements of aircraft within their territory, citing examples of such controls instituted by Mexico, Canada and Ireland. He indicated receptiveness to the proposal that the list of suggestions be made available to the aviation officials concerned.

SECRET

urged the government of Chile to refuse visas to Cuban delegatÃ«s
to a preparatory meeting planning for the II Latin Americon
Youth Congress scheduled for August in the Chilean capital.
Inability of Cuban delegates to obtain Chilean visas for this
meeting is one of the contributing factors to the Cuban sponsors
announcing during August that the meeting had been postponed.

k. Sent general instructions to our missions in countries
which participate in the Intematioml Union of Architects asking
then to urge the cooperation of governmental authorities in
preventing or discouraging the attendance of their citizens to

where feasible to dissuade architects from free world countries
from serving on the jury for the selection of a Bay of Figs
momsient.

1. Urged Canadian Government to block a plan to
   commence food parcel shipments to Cuba, on a Comercial basis,

British Guiana in mid-July. MITCHURINSK was under U.8.
surveillance from its departure fron Havane until United
Kingdom forces assumed the task of keeping this ship under
surveillance upon its approach to Georgetown, British Gulana.
Subsequently, British police search of MITCHURINSK in British
Gulane vaters revealed nothing of a suspicious nature.

Central Intelligence Agency

the Peruvian Government late in August published a new anti-
terrorists lav providing a penalty of no less than five years
imprisonment for persons who particiate in guerrilla activities
or in the illegal manufacture of weapons or explosives.

Operational dates for the multi-channel radio stations to be installed in Managua, Nicaragua and Tegucigalpa, Honduras have been delayed to 15 October 1963 and 15 December 1963, respectively because of new engineering and contractual requirements. Negotiations are continuing with Colombia and Ecuador for installation of U.S. military radio facilities.

Filled, partially, the authorized billets in the U.S. Southern Command Intelligence Center and took under consideration the problem of an increase in the billet structure in the Center. The Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Southern Command together with his intelligence officer visited Honduras and Nicaragua and determined that no significant problems existed which would interfere with effective operations in those countries.

CIA Stations throughout Latin America continued in a
great majority of countries to furnish to the local internal
security organizations with whom they are in liaison informa-
tion concerning travelers to and from Cuba, as well as such
information as came to CIA's attention concerning the movement
of funds, arms and propaganda material. In many instances, the
furnishing of information to the internal security service by
the CIA Station was paralleled by the furnishing of similar
information to the foreign office by the Ambassador or his
representative. The response to this information has varied
greatly. The Central American countries, in general, began to
pay attention to the information and take action on it. At the
other extreme, the Brazilian Government/showed little inclination during the reporting period
to follow up on the information.

TO: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

INFO: Deputy Chief WR/C

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: LIRING/OPERATIONAL/PRQ Part II on LIRING-3

ACTION REQUIPED - REFERENCES

Reference: HMMA 30540 of 10 November 1966

1.  A PEQ Part II for LIRING-3 is being forwarded under separate cover. It is to be noted that LIRING-3 has not been recruited in the name of WOFACT, but instead is engaged in clandestine activities for Wallace B. ROWTON, who LIRING-3 believes is a Greek businessman with international connections who requires economic, political and personality information in order to conduct his business.

2.  The fact that LIRING-3 is not aware of his WOFACT connection, at the present time, outweights the value which would accrue were an attempt made to make him knowledgeable. He performs clandestinely for ROWTON and he is actualy attacking priority targets. In this way he works against the target with a clear conscience and his left-wing sentiments are not threatened.

3.  The operation is moving, however, toward the eventual full re-cruitment of LIRING-3, but it is moving slowly in that direction because of the political and social beliefs of Subject. One advantage of this felse flag recruitment of this individual, at the present time, is the fact that he is able to enter the target area without fear of capture and exposure as an enemy agent. Under the present plan of operation he believes his work actually is aiding the revolution which he believes in from an idealistic standpoint.

**INSTRUCTIONS TO CASE OFFICER**

1.  This form must be filled in by the case officer or appropriate authority on the basis of the best available information. It is *not* to be shown to the subject.
2.  Normally, headquarters will be unable to issue an approval unless requester furnishes answers to all questions in PRQ parts I and II. However, in an emergency provisional approval may be obtained by complying with the applicable provisions of FR 10-215, paragraphs 6a, 8, 12b and 12d. Thereafter the usual period to document or complete the case must be followed as set forth in FR 10-215.
3.  Three (3) completed copies of PRQ part I (including copy in subject's handwriting, if possible) and two (2) completed copies of this form must be sent to headquarters as soon as possible.
4.  Data acquired later must be sent to headquarters in PRQ format in two (2) copies.

SECTION I

1. CRYPTONYM

2. PSEUDONYM

**CONTACT AND DEVELOPMENT**

1.  INDICATE HOW, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, AND BY WHOM SUBJECT WAS FIRST CONTACTED OR DEVELOPED.

    Alison Newton first met subject on or about April, 1956, at the Celon de la Justice in Nice, Marceau, Odette Mourin ?, Maurice Hlies (Charles Harris, Fred Businessman), on the pretext that he was interested in arranging for subject to paint a mural for a night-club in New York City. The approach was cold and subject did not question Hurton's bona fides either as a *free* or international businessman visiting Nice as a tourist. This first meeting led to social contact with subject and wife.

2.  INDICATE WHETHER SUBJECT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY AND IN A SECURE MANNER TO ANY RESPONSIBLE CASE OFFICER FOR HANDLING. IF SO, INDICATE TO WHOM.

    Subject could easily be turned over to a *friend* or business associate of Hurton who could work as a (semi-serious) third country national, preferably a Greek. Connections to M. Hlimmins. Political connections could be initiated at this point.

3.  LIST OTHER CASE OFFICERS WHO HAVE HANDLED SUBJECT OR WHOM HE KNOWS OR HAS KNOWN, GIVE NAMES BY WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN KNOWN.

9 November, 1966.

Subject: Review and Assessment of LIRING Operation.

L. Background, Character and Assessment of LIRING/3:

1. Liring/3 (Subject) is a 36-year-old Mexican artist of the Diego Rivera School and an asteisitic existentialist oriented toward the philosophy of Jean Paul Sartre, with relatively strong Leftist political convictions. He has produced a fair amount of painting and had relatively good success in murals both in Cuba and Mexico, but has not succeeded in selling many of his works, despite numerous expositions, sponsored by the Mexican Government plastic arts organization (Bellas Artes). Because of his family, educational and environmental background, Subject feels that his work has not been appreciated for its intrinsic worth by the Mexican Government and tends to blame his political convictions for this lack of acceptance. Subject, however, has, as he himself asserts, no feelings of bitterness or resentment, although he frequently experiences the "anguish, forelomness and loneliness" of the existentialist, but he has not permitted himself to degenerate into a beatnik either in his personal or artistic life. Subject has confided to Rowton that he has no real friends and that he has withdrawn from society, the dictates of which he cannot accept. He enjoys the prospect of travel, especially abroad, "to develop his art" but also as an escape from the pressures and obligations of the social life he has been forced to lead in Mexico.

2. Shortly after he met Rowton, in April, 1966, Subject confessed that he felt himself at a critical point in his personal and artistic life. He indicated that he felt paradoxes inherent in his philosophy were-overwhelming and depressing him and that he welcomed friendship with Rowton, an experienced foreigner whom he felt he could trust implicitly. At one critical point, Subject quit his rather tedious job with the Ministry of Education (teaching art in a public school) with the comment that "everyone must make personal decisions and take risks, and I have decided to throw my lot in with you (Rowton) for better or worse, and so have quit the job since it was interfering with my availability". This he did without knowing any more about Rowton than his name, which technical surveillance revealed he did not accept as a true name, and with no guarantees of future financial support from Rowton. Rowton, in his conversations with Subject, has been careful not to reveal any data concerning his personal life and background, including his permanent or local address, providing Subject only with the number of a telephone answering service, and using the safehouse rented by Subject as a principal point of contact. Subject has accepted money from Rowton, at first only for previously approved expenses, and subsequently for his personal use, but has accepted Rowton's initiative in this matter, and made no demands on Rowton for remuneration for services rendered. He has been meticulous in accounting for funds and shown no reluctance to sign receipts presented to him by Rowton (with his true-name signature). Subject has confessed (and shown) an almost complete lack of experience in business and intelligence work, but has accepted Rowton's guidance, where required, without hesitation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 89

3. Subject, in his political outlook, is left of center, with history of revolutionary activity in Cuba from 1961 until his return to Mexico in 1964. Subject has insisted to Rowton that, because of his (existentialist) philosophy, ho has never permitted himself to join any organization, including the communist party, although he has given moral and material suport to wootonowy movement both in Quin and tiny Mexico. Subject has confessed his disillusionment wish many of the revolutionary leaders in Cuba and with all of the lexican leaders, remarking that sooner or later "the read" revolution will come to Lexico to eliminate the cor- ruption and injustice that provoils throu, hout the country. Subiect, howeve feels that in the meantime he must live under a more practical philosophy of daily iffe and is willing is make the necessary compromises to assist Rowton in his busines affairs. Subject has shown no reluctance to exploit his friends, and even his wife, to be of specific service to Rowtch, and has, on numerous occasions, volunteered to do so with Rowton's approval. This appears to Roston to be a reflection of the existentialist conviction that his philosophy gives him freedom to choose without dependency, obligation or justification.

4. Rowton is aware that Subject is currently undergoing a decisive climacteric, the future direction of which is not as yet certain. Rowton has succesied in making Subject compromise a great deal with his past idcale particularly concerning deep involvement with other people and acceptance of financial support for purely business transactions, and for this reason has hesitated to uncover for Subject any of the mystery surrounding his own life and activives. subject aisilkes "horthamericans" and considers life in the U.S., with which he is not familiar from experience, 65 corrupt and decadent. Rowton feels that he can eventually break down Subject's prejudice, if this proves to be necessar^na worthwhile, but it would be fatal at this time for Rowton to reveal his ______ and ______ collections..
   Subject is, in his own words, completely confident of Rowton's good will toward him and is, at least for the moment, totally dependent upon him for guidance as well as financial support. Any attempt at direct recruitment at this point would, in Rowton's opinion be counterproductive.
   In his various contacts with the Cubans thus far, particularly his current visit to Havana on what appears to be an IS briefing, Subject can in all respects act naturally, without the feeling that he is concealing anything from his Cuban friends, simply because he is unwitting of Rowton's true affiliations and intentions. If he were witting, he would appear to all concerned to be suffering from a severe psychological crisis, and cerusinly would not be in a good position to produce useful information or inspire confidence. Subjecu is under some strain as a result of his current relationship with Rowton in his capacity as an international bourgeois busi- Lessman, a fact attested to by his wife to Rewten on 7 November when she expressed concerns over Subject's recent moodiness and lack of interest in painting. Subject has also become involved in a love affair with one of his rich art students, a Mexican woman who is known to visit Subject at the safehouse.

5. In summation Rowton feels that Subject is excellent potential agent material, both because of his background and experience as well as his direct access to targets of interest. The problems inherent in his philosophical and psycholomical make-up will continue to be taken into conside- ration. in developing Subject's full potential. The obvious disadvantages of Subject's unwitting status vis-a-vis [...] can be overcome by careful dandling of Subject and increased controllover him in the future.

## Development of LIRING/3 by Howton:

6. Roston met Subject in April, 1966, by cold apronch in the art studio where Subject at the time was presenting his latest works vader sponsorship of Bellas Artes. Roston poned as a Greek businessman interested in Subject's style and his immediate objective at the time was to ascertain the address in Dew York City of Subject's wife's father( a Cuban of Chinese origin who had left Cuba as a refugee). Row-: ton, feeling that he had to present an above-average prospect to Subject to permit future meetings, alleged that he was anxious to arrange for the painting of a mural to be installed in a New York nightclub owneż by a Greek friend of cis (Rita Dimitri, owner and performer at the "La Chansonette"). Rowten felt that pin-pointing a "New York nibhgtclub" would have the double advantage of determining Subject's sentiments toward working in New York City and in a bourgeois environment.

7. Subject reacted very favorably to the initial approach and accepteć Rowton's invitation to dinner in the company of Subject's wife the next evening. Both Subject and his wife were cautious in rovealing any specific data concerning their background and personal history, but neither con- • cealed their mutual approval of Castro's regime and dislike for the corruption in Mexico. As a result of this mecting Roston realized that any attment at a direct approach to either Jubject or his wife, who was then employed part-time at the Cuban Consulate, would be conterproductive and that a more subtle approach would have to be developed. Roston decided that a strong personal relationship developed bwith Subject would be productive and cold eventually lead to useful roduction on Subject's part.

8. When, therefore, on 2 Hay, 1966, Subject expressed gratification at having met Rowton and indicated that he wished to continue his friendly contacts, regardless of whether Rowtcn purchased his painting or arranged for the mural, Roston Dy moved in with an offer to "hire" Subject as his business associate on an unofficial basis, so that Subject could acquire a degree of indemence financially and perhaps do some traveling for Rowton. "In order to develop as much clandestinity as possible in his future contacts with Subjec, Rowton explained that heas simply a tourist in Nexico and as such not permitted to engage in lucrative business activities. He would therefore have to depend on Subject's discretion in any dealings he might have with him. Subject accepted this as quite normal but pointed out to Raton his limitations was far as business training and experience went. In reply to Rowton's cuery, he did confess, however, that he had excellent contacts in Havana that could be exploited for business dealings with Cuba. He volunteered to make an exploratory trip to Havana to renew his friendship with the perons concerned. Rowton accepted this offer, not only to test Subject's story but also to seize the occasion to be in a position to provide Subject with money to make the trip and thus compromise him somewhat at the outset.

9. Rowton's next move was to explain to Subject that he had a long- term interest in Cuba and hoped to do a great deal of business in the fu- utre but first felt it was essential that both te and Subject develop the proper contacts inside to ensure success. Subject readily agreed to this and felt relieved that. Roston did not expect him to produce concrete results overnight. When Howton, therefore sunrested that. Subject find and rent a safehouse for entertainment and development of prospective contacts, Subject Att to work immediately without question. (Althoug Rowton's sucestion was first made on 17 Juno, Subject did not succced in finding a suitable place until the end of July) This project, however, cave Subject something speci- fic and relatively clandestine to do for Rowton without scriously compro- mising any of his principles. Subject, as it developed later, was intereste in such a hide-away, unknown even to his wife, for his own purposes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 91

10. Inasmuch as Subject and his wife had long lived an almost ascetic life in a small sparcely furnished apartment with no apparent luxuries and dressed in the simpless and apparently most inexpensive clothing available, and furthermore apparently did not have any conscious desire to improve their living conditions, Rowton realized that financial control over Subject would be difficult to establish unless Subject and his wife could re made to lift their eyes to see a more comfortable and promising life within their reach. He therefore chose some of the best restaurants for lunch dates with Subject (prior to the renting of the safehouse), brought several relatively expensive dolls and toys for their child, arranged through the COS το have a credit account opened for Subject and his wife at Sears Roebuck Stores and was able to present Subject with a credit card that would enable Subject and his wife to make. effort-less purchases on credit. Rowton. aiso persuaded Subject to open a checking account at the Banco de Londres y Kexico, ostensibly so that he could keep better track of the ront paymonts or. the safehouse. All these bourgeois trappings were calculated to raise Subject and his family fromthe com-placent proletariat standard of living into which they had sunk. Subject oxpressed to Rowton his appreciation for such gestures and confessed that he now realized the importance of these outward signs of respectability and as a result felt more able to sten into the world of higher society. His wife also revealed in her comments of appreciation to Howton that she welcomed the prospect of a better life for herself and her child and hoped to be able to purchase enough furniture to make her home respectable and permit her to invite guests occasionnily.

11. The one adverse effect of this effort on Rowton's part has beer that Cubject becan to see se....ment foamorous one of his art students, an apparently wealthy Mexican woman, who has no in effect become his mistress (as revealed by technical surveillance frem an I' in the same building set up and run very effectively by Meûbury). Subject has revealed the rame and address of this woman to howton in con-nection with the establishment of a 2.0. Box which could be used as a drop for communication between Subject and Rowton while the former was in Cuba; but he has not to date told Rowton of his illicit relationship with the woman. This development can, of course, serve assa notential control over Subject end can be used in any future
    examination, but, on the other hand may lead to complications in suoject's personal life and create hostility on the part of his wife, should she discover the philandering o Subject. She might likewise tend to blame Roxton for Subject's conduct. For this reason Rowton has made every effort to maintain good relations with Subject's wife ( she has already confided to howton her concern over Sub-ject's recent Loodiness, as stated above) in the hope that she will turn to Rowton for help in the event she feels her marraige in jeopardy. Considera-tion is also being given to the possibility of breaking up as discreetly as possible Subject's affair with the Mexican woman in the event that it becones more serious. Technical surveillance of the trysts will continue to provide useful information in this direction.

12. With regard to the use of Subject unwittingly to elicit operati:nal information from his Cuban friends in Mexico City as well as Havana, Rowton gradually impressed on Subject the need to acquire all possible information both political and economic on Cuban developements as a prelude to enreging in serious and lucrative business with the Castro regime. Subiect accepted this line without question and did produce some useful inside information of value. The turning point, however, came in connection with the disappear-ance of Julian Ibrez, the Press Attache of the Embassy in Nexico City in late September, 1966. Subject reported the disappearance to Rowton with some glee, commenting that he and his wife were convinced that López had gone


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 92

5. 
off on a bince with some friends. Subject then repeated to Rowton his criticism of López' childisonoss and inexperience and recalled that when he himself had pointed out to López his nescience in handling his Embassy functions(in the Press and Cultural Field) López had shrugged off his admonitions with the comment that there were more important things to do for the revolution. The disregard, bordering on distain, with which López as well as apparently other Cuban officials, had greeted Subject's friendly advice in the past, obviously cut Subject to the quick and fostered in hia sive resentment of a peasant toward a master. Taking this into consideration and in the hope of stirring up as much trouble for López and the Embassy as possible, the Station permitted Rowton to pass to Subject the highly restricted information that López hoi actually been arrested by the Mexican police for complicity in the arms smuggling ring that has recently been uncovered in their operations from Mexico into Guatemala. Rowton Cave Subject enough details to make the story convincing and asked Subject to attribute the information to "Central American friends" and to stress that it was already in the hands of the press. In addition Rowton suggested that Subject pass this information personally to López as a hot tip so that López could discreetly disappear before the reporters managed to question him. When Subject did as requested by Rowton, López was apparently so overwhelmed with gratitude for Subject's good intentions that he informed the Ambassador the following morning (just before his suddent departure for Havana). Events then moved swiftly. The Ambassador called in Subject and expressed his personal appreciation for Subject's interest and help in this delicate matter and wood with Subject that the evolvement of Embassy personnel in arms smuggling was placing Cuban-Mexican relations in jeopardy. Over at tuis raised Subject's status in the eyes of the Ambassador and his closest advisors (Curbelo and Ceneda) to that of a valued confident rather than simply a friend of the revolution. This obviously eased Subject and gave him all the more anxious to conceal the role of Rowton in the affair so that all the credit would continue to fall to him.

13. As a result Subject was subsequently called in by Curbelo and Cepeda and asked to offer his services to help the Tricontinental in its work in Central America. On Rowton's advice (which Subject sollicited) the offer was accepted on condition that the work to be done would be serious (i.e. worth the personal risks Subject would have to run) and the Subject would be permitted to work without the overt involvement of the Local Embassy, These conditions were promply accepted and Subject was invited to visit Havana again so that he could be briefed on the spot by Osmani Cienfuego and his staff.

14. Subject was thus catapulted into the level of IS activities, with Rowton maneuvered into a position et éminence grise. It remains to be seen following Subject's return from Havana (estimated at 21 November, 1966) whether Subject will be entrusted with secret requirements by the Tricontinental, but it appears certain at this point that Rowton will be able to provide full guidance to Subject and to steer the operations he might be engaged in toward targets of interest to [ ].

C- Biographical Data Elicited from LIRING/3:

15. Subject was born in Mexico City in 1930 of a middle class family. Subject's grandfather was a well-known textile merchant who served some 12 years as president of the Chamber of Commerce. At least one of Subject's aunts is currently well-to-do and the owner of several apartment houses in Mexico City. Subject has at present little or no contact with his family.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

16. At the age of 15 Subject left home to join the Mexican Kavy, Subject has commented to Rowton that his childhood was not particularly happy and that his mother and father separated, apparently when he was in his teens. It appears likely that Subject left home as a result of family dissension. Subject states that his desire to travel and see the world wasvery strong at the time he joined the navy.

17. Inasmuch as the legal are for enlistment was 18, Subject had to have his birth certificate altered to show that he had been born in 1927 rather than 1930. As a consecuence all of Subject's official documents now show his birth-date ns 1227, including his passport.

18. Subject served a three-year hitch in the navy and visited nearly all the ports of Mexico and many of Central America. Subject's speciality anperrs to have been in the quartermaster breach, since he learned the rudiments of navigation and shin-t-aoling. Sen he left the nval service, Subject entered the University of Fexico and took courses in Archaeolo and anthropole for the next two years. Subject simultaneously developed a strong interest in painting and sculpture and over the next five or so xx years, studied under such masters as Rivera ani Siquieros.

19. Subject was married in 1950 at the ace of twenty years to a young Mexican woman from Leon, GTC..and durist the next ten years had a at least four children by her. He divorced cis wife in about 1960, just prior to his departure for Cuba, he had not been on good terms with hor for solo e to the women. From about 105":100
    ject worked in the Mexican Government Social Service among the Indians in the southern states of Mexico. Suspect attributes some of the tension that arose between him and his wife to this employment venture. He commented to Rowton that his first wife wanted to live a quiet normal life in Mexico City and was unwilling to share with him the hardships of social work in remote areas of tropical Mexico. During this perioi Subject gradually de- veloped his own style in painting and began to establish close contacts with Mexican art circles.

20. Subject went to Cuba in about 1900 "to join the revolution",ap- parently as a result of his increasingly leftist political sympathies. He dià a relatively large amount of rainting ani mural work during his four- ycar residence in Cuba, while at the same time working in the Ministry of Labor and Education. In about 1961 he marrieš a Cuban woman Chinese oririn from Santiago de Cuba and the following year a (girl) child was born to them in davana. Subject has told Rowton that he has had very tittle contact with his first wife since his divorce and pays no alimony. He sided that his family, however, has continued to take an interest in his first wife and the children of his first marriage and has helped to support them financially. During his stay in Cute, Subject developed close friendship with many Cuban revolutionaries, particularly Arnol Rodriques, whose wire worked with Subject in the Ministry of Mucation at the time when Arnol Rodriquez was serving as Minister of jaber.

21. Subject returned to Mexico City in 1964 with his new wife and child (whom he had naturalized es a Mexican citizen). By this time Subject had become a professional artist but supplemented the rather modest incone he acquired from the sale of his painting by teaching art privately and in Mexican public schoois. His monthly incore during 1965 and early 1966 did not exceed. 3,000 pesos.

MEMORANDUM:

24 Oct 66

SUBJECT : Handling of LIRING-3 as Hostile Agent

In view of Station Mexico City's statement in paragraph 6 of MEXI 8944 (IN 23093), which presumably comes from LIRING-3's handler Wallace B. ROWTON, to the effect that LIRING-3 "still has strong anti-U.S. feelings", the time has come to review the LIRING-3/Ops in the same cable. the Station set forth several control elements including true name receipts and taps made in ROWTAN's safehouse of LIRING-3's amourous sessions with a young art student. What appears to be lacking is considering the case as the handling of a double agent, probably hostile, his homework--that is to say, that there are certain actions that should be taken in the case as follows:

a. Placing of a phone tap on L-3's telephone, if it can be determined that he has a telephone.

b. Intercept of all mail going to LIRING-3's home address.

c. Physical and photo surveillance of L-3 to determine any patterns of actions or contacts with suspicious persons. if L-3's contacts and actions agree with what L-3 tells ROWTON and to allow ROWTON to be prepared to cover himself in his relations with L-3.

d. To discreetly investigate I-3's sources of income, i.e., to see if his income from teaching art classes (and more recently from his wife's salary from BIRING) are sufficient to account for his scale of living, whatever it is.

Secret


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 128

There are indications in the file that the "homework" as outlined above has not yet been done. The Station was queried in DIR 39039, and in DIR-07441 as to the above matters. It is noted in MEXICO CITY-8944 that the Station said that it did not as yet have "independent checks" on this agent, beyond evidence of entry to the Cuban Embassy furnished by LIONION photo surveillance, and in fact had only his word on claimed actions and statements, and that LIENVOY and LITAINT-2 confirm that L-4, L-3's wife, is definitely employed as a secretary to LIRING-1 as claimed by L-3. The Station tended to doubt that L-3 is a Cuban plant but said that even if he were, that it was no additional risk (the Station was referring to a proposed trip by L-3 to Cuba) since L-3 would be provided with a suitable uncheckable explanation as to how L-3 obtained info on the LOPEZ case.

e. Check as suggested in DIR 07441 on status of LIRING-4's father, who is presumably a Chinese, reportedly in the United States. This is of interest in view of stringent U.S. entry requirements laid on Chinese.

4. ROWTON ENCOURAGED L-3 PROCEED WITH PLANS FOR TRIP AND

   (AS GREEK FRIEND) TO CUBANS BUT WOULD COUNT COMPLETELY ON LATTER'S
   ADVICE AND GUIDANCE IN ALL ACTIONS. AGREED WITH ROWTON HE SHOULD NOT

   IN MEETING WITH L-2.

5. L-3 FEELS CUBA NEEDS COMMERCIAL CONTACTS WITH WEST. SINCE
   ROWTON DOES NOT APPEAR AGAINST REVOLUTION AND WANTS DEVELOP TRADE
   WITH CUBA, L-3 WILLING WORK FOR HIM. AGREES WITH ROWTON THAT TO
   TRADE WITH CUBA, MUST HAVE GOOD INSIGHT IN WHAT IS GOINGON THERE,
   POLITICALLY AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY. AT SAME TIME L-3 BELIEVE CUBANS
   OPERATING IN MEXICO WITH POOR SECURITY AND FEELS THAT WITH ROWTON'S
   ASSISTANCE COULD DO BETTER JOB AND SERVE BOTH ROWTON AND REVOLUTION.
   HIS CONDUCT WITH CUBANS THEREFORE IS NATURAL AND HIS CLANDESTINITY

OTHER CONTROL ELEMENTS ARE TRUE NAME RECEIPTS AND TAPES MADE IN POWTON'S SAFE HOUSE OF L-3 AMOROUS SESSIONS WITH YOUNG ART STUDENT. IN VIEW OF ABOVE BELIEVE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF L-3 SHOULD CONTINUE ON CURRENT BASIS HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ROWTON AS NOTHING WOULD BE GAINED BY FORMAL RECRUITMENT AT THIS TIME.

7. STATION AWARE CUBANS MAY WANT GET L-S TO CUBA TO QUESTION HIM ABOUT "SOURCES" FROM WHOM OBTALLED INFO ON LOPEZ.

   THE SHIPS ARE POSSIBLY TO BE USED TO TRANSPORT THE 1967 SUGAR CROP, WHICH
   ALLEGEDLY WILL REACH LARGE PROPORTIONS.) (FIELD COMMENT: PERHAPS A REDUCTIOI

# DISPATCH

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET

TO: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

FROM: Deputy Chief WB/C and Chief of Station/JMWAVE

SUBJECT: Chief of Station, Mexico City

REFERENCE: LIRING-1 and LIRING-2

ACTION REQUIRED: NO ACTION REQUIRED

1. On 6 September 1966 Station Officer Lawrence V. BARKER attended a meeting of the Comite' de la Amistad (a loosely knit, rather nebulous association used in the past primarily as a stepping stone or status by honorary consular officers. With the exception of LIRING-1 as president of the group in late 1965, representatives of JMWAVE have generally boycotted the meetings. In the belief that the documents were written to restrict so that another slate of officers might be elected, BARKER was selected to attend for JMWAVE. As it turned out, the meeting drew only nine persons and no business of any consequence was transacted.

Dispatch is to report certain conclusions drawn previously met. The purpose of this letter "presided" over the meeting about LIRING-1 and LIRING-2.

2. LIRING-1 impressed BARKER as being intelligent, articulate, self confident, affable and attractive. It was clear that, while LIRING-1 holds an office in the association, he intended to speak for himself and LIRING-2. He explained in a straightforward manner that he felt that the sad state of the association was due to politics; namely, that a representative of a "socialist country" (LIRING-2) had been elected president in a super-intending sector. He felt that because of this week of the other consular officers were avoiding meetings and that no amount of nice diplomatic flair could slide this fact. (This impressed BARKER as a good estimate of the situation.) LIRING-1 then said that he felt it would be best for LIRING-2 to step down so that the association could once again draw people to its meetings. He further promised that the JMWAVE representative would stick with the association as ordinary members and give there full support to the next state of officers.

3. Dressed in a rather lumpy and shabby suit that appeared to have been made from old army blankets dyed dark blue, LIRING-2 made up for his appearance and slight stature by flashing a warm smile and being pleasant throughout the meeting which consisted of a sojourn at the bar followed by dinner.

attempted, apparently with success to exorcise all NIMROD slang and accent from his own speech, and LIRING-1 never inspired whether BARKER had ever been to PARISIN or had any connection with various PARISIEN. He seemed genuinely interested in BARKER's initial on Mayan archaeology and anthropology and by the end of the meal was slapping BARKER on the back. While young and perhaps somewhat immature, LIRING-1 appears to be a tough character, quick-witted and thoroughly convinced that he stands for what is right. The overall impression is at variance with what had been expected from AFSPICE-1 and, to some extent, AMCANARY reports. LIRING-1 is an "odd" and while he may have plenty to learn in the intelligence trade he appears to be quite capable of learning if given sufficient time. From the opposition viewpoint he should be an effective agent developer.

4. For the record, it should be noted that he has a ruddy complexion and bright blue-green eyes.

5. LIRING-2, on the other hand, appears to be a rather wishy-washy sort of weakness. Although superior to LIRING-1 in the association and within LIRING itself, he took a back seat to LIRING-1 in the discussions. He seems somewhat internally introverted. He is pleasant but one gets the impression that this is a matter of diplomatic correctness.

6. The above observations are all based on a one-time, two-hour encounter and may well be inaccurate. They are set forth, however, in an effort to assist in arriving at a correct assessment of key opposition personnel, primarily LIRING-1. He has the makings of a good operator and merits respect as well as study with a view to his eventual recruitment.

"they have a center in Tehuantepec for the training of guerrillas for Central America..." in the light of Subject Report involving the same general area and the identification of Mauricio de la MAZA Venegas by AMMUG-1 in 1964 as the Salvadoran Communist Party link with the Cuban Intelligence Service in Mexico City.

2. For the information of Stations Guatemala City and San Salvador, reference B reported information from a Mexican ex-military physician of unkown reliability that the Cuban Consulate in Merida had established a group of Cubans in Ixmulcalco, Palpaico, where the Retalhuleu/Ayutla Dam is being finished, who are training Mexicans in guerrilla tactics; and reference C reported background information on Salpeso published in the Mexican Pro-Castro magazine Siempre under the byline of one Carlos Navarrete. It was noted that a person by the name of Carlos Navarrete had been reported by LIENVOY-1 in 1963 as a Guatemalan communist living in Mexico. It is now noted that the Siempre staff appear reportedly to have been taking more than usual interest of interest in the Calapa area (which includes Tehuantepec). In addition to the Siempre article on Palpaico, the 31 August 1966 issue carried no less than eleven articles and a four-page color picture spread on the area by Juan Batiz Velasquez, Horacio Quiñones, Pedro Alvarado Lang, Pablo Mondragon, Antonio FLORES, Nabor Yañez, Renato Leduc, José Cidros, and Rodolfo Manrique. One of the articles by Mondragon even reported that on the road from Tapachula, the entire Siempre team almost perished in a near-automobile accident. The same issue carried part two of the article on guerrilla activities of the

Fuerzion Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR) by Antonio CAZAM. Antonio CAZAM may be identical with Antonio CAZAM Rafoul, a Havana native and architect who was born in Tuxtla, Chiapas. CAZAM was reported to be a high official of the Frente Electoral del Pueblo (FEP) in 1963 and is believed to be identical with the Antonio CAZAM who was reliably reported in May 1968 to be in contact with Aldrich HePPNER of the Third Secretary in Mexico City. HePPNER felt the Communist Party may have very close connections with reports of guerrilla training in the area of Villa of First Lieutenant of Victor Rico Galan, toward Guerrilla writer and pro-Castro activist, on 18 August 1968 for subversive activities, the information may be of background interest.

3. File 201-1380-1 is deleted. It might be of interest to attempt to entertain if he has access for further light to throw on the subversive area with respect to Guerrilla training activities and to seek him to keep aa our out for such information.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT

DATE

25 OCT 1967

FILE NUMBER

807668 - 798301

*   Rec'd for coordination an outgoing cable to WEXI, saying that PREVOLIS had been granted a Limited Contact-Assessment POA on 19 Jan '67.

*   The next sentence said that WH/1 was asking for amendment of this contact & assessment POA so that PREVOLIS could provide cover for LIRING-3 (201-798301). Jack Stewart, at the outset of our conversation when I mentioned L-3, said "I hope you never get mixed up in the LIRING-3 case." What a mess."

I informed Stewart I had been deeply "mixed up" in the L-3 case since 3 June '66 when Stewart himself requested a POA on L-3. I told him of the three notices over a six month period I had sent to WH/1 asking for resolution of the derog info and my invitation to discuss CI/OA moves leading a word from WH/1 in answer to its notices. Thus on 20 Dec '66, CI/OA closed the LIRING-3 file for failure to comply. Stewart said Stone was handling L-3 as a hostile, but appeared dumbfounded that the use of so such a person as a directed agent requires that that person qualify as a possible.

To the requested amendment on PREVOLIS, the latter has only a limited POA because of items cited in POA granting; moreover, L-3 has never had the proper approval and was technically disapproved by the action of 20 Dec. 1966.

Stewart secured guidance telling MEXT that they were asking for such an amendment, and I coordinated on a simple notification of no action of 19 Jan '67.

EXEPET FROM HAMA 29157

Para 32: "ROWTON is off and running on his development of LIRINGS 3 and 4. He is doing this under false flag as a Greek businessman. Again, the ubiquitous LITIIKT-2 is in a position to monitor this operation as he is close to both LIRINGS and has no connection with ROWTON. On 27 May LIRING-3, who is well connected in PERUMEN, flew to PERUMEN on a trip to scout out business opportunities for ROWTON. LIRING-4 continues to work at LIRING."

2 May, 1966

Subject: Sallace B Eowton Contact with Carlos Jurado.

1. At about 1830 on 2 ay, 1966, Roston dropped into the Salon de La Fiastica Mexicana in the hope of running into Subject so that he could renew contact more or less casually.

2. Fortunately as soon as he stepped into the door he found Subject engaged in conversation with the receptionist and another person (probably a Mexican employe of the Salon). When Subject spotted howton he brcke off his conversation and moved away to greet Rowton cordially. He said that he had himself just arrived at the Salon and was very hapy to run into nowton again. After a few griff remarks, he invited Roston to coffee in a nearby care. howton accepted and they both left the Sa-

3. Reaton remained with Subject in conversation over coffee for about 45 minutes. Subject expressed gratification in having zet Rowtón and several times reassured Boston that he enjoyed conversing with him regardless of whether he made an sale of his painting or not. Roston reverted to the theme that he had a genuine interest in subject's future and hoped in some way to provide Jubject with the means of becoming relatively independent so that he could travel and carry on his art work freely. Roston added that he had given much thought to the idea of using Subject to help him in his economic research, since this would justify Rowton's patsing Subj ct on his ex; ense account. He then questioned Subject on his possible connections in Mexico, but Subject confessed that he had only limited contacts that probably wo ld not be useful to Roston. Rowton then moved into the target question. He stated that most of his clients in England, Frence and Greece were interested in Cuban requirements and perhaps Subject was in a unique position to prepare a report on what the Cuban econcas required at the moment. Subject responded without bestitation that he could do something on Cuba without too much ifficulty. He explained that he knew official Cubars in bexico City, including those in the Commercial Dission, and could travel into Cuba if necessary.

4. Roxton then stressed that he really did not need too many statistics on the Cuban economy nor contact with the Cubans but wanted somehow to Justify helping Subject financially. He explained that he could easily assemble some data himself, but wanted subject to do something concrete so that he would remain in the picture ang koton could consider him in

a sort of stringer in reporting of economic developments.. Jubject
replied that he understood and did not see that such a task would be
too difficult.

5. Roston then asked Subject how he was coming in locating a new aprt-
   ment/studio. Subject replied that he had found a desire le place near
   Chapultepec, and hoped to be able to nove soon. Howton then commented
   that he might have to leave for Paris in the next few days and would be
   away for about two weeks on business. He stated that he might be able
   to help subject with the rent on his studio provided it had a phone.
   Rowton explained that he was at present paying 350 pesos monthly for
   secretarial service and could just as well pay Subject something for
   taking telephone messages. Jubject replied that he would be glad to
   be of service to Rowton without compensation ( "mi casa es suya")on
   such a matter.

6. Rowton then turned the conversation to Subjects wife and family.
   Subject revealed that his wife's maiden name ( apellido) was the
   Chinese translation of "Flor de Durazno". He pronounced it in Chinese
   for Rowten but Rowton made no attempt to transliterate it and at this
   point cannot recall the phonetic pronunciation. Subject added that Chi-
   chay is a Cuban corruption of the Chinese given came. In reply to How-
   ton's direct query, Subject stated that his fe's father mother is in
   Cuba but her father is in New York. de added that her father did not
   agree with the revolution and left but the rest of the fasily remained.
   He also stated that her mother has not remarried and lives with her
   brothers and sisters. Subject added that his wife feit no bitterness
   toward her father and in fact the father whites regularly once a woek
   from New York. wowton did not press for an adress at the time, feeling
   that it Rould be more discreet to wait for en orening at a subsequent
   meeting(when he could allege that he was planning to stop over in Kew
   York).

7. nowten took the occasion of his alleged impending departure to ask
   for Subject's home address so that he could write from Curope. Subject
   stated that since he might move it would be better for Boston to write
   to him care of the Salon rather than to his present address.

8. On leaving subject Ro ton promised to pass by the Salon again before
   he left so that he could say goodbye to Subject.

2 May, 1966

Subject: Wallace B. Rowton Contact with Carlos Jurado.

1. When Rowton arrived at the entrance to the Bellas Artes Building at 1100 on 30 April, as planned, he found Subject waiting on the steps. Subject greeted Rowton cordially and sugested that they take a taxi since the Ministry of Education building was a little too far to walk to. He then hailed a taxi and instructed the driver to take them to the Secretaria de Loucation Publica on Calle Argentina.

2. On arrival he escorted Rowton through the court-yand of the building and explained the murals of Diego Rivera. He commented that he felt the murals were superior to those at the frado Hotel and commented since they had more "social meaning". He stressed the hardship under which Rivera had worked, which included some physical danger from certain elements opposed to his socialist ideas. Rowton picked up this theme in relationship to Subject's own situation in an attempt to elicit as much information as possible concerning Subject's financialstatus and position vis-a-vis the Mexican government.

3. In the course of conversation Subject stated that he had received relatively little understanding and sympathy frca the government of-ficials as a whole but did receive some sup ort from the Instituto Kacional de Bellas Artes. He explained that he was able to earn enough money from teaching assignments to be relatively independent, and not depend on sales of his picutres to make a living. In reply to Rowton's comment to the effect that perhaps his wife could find some employment to help Subject, the latter replied that his wife could not work because of her status. He quickly added that he pro-bably would not find it difficult to procure working papers for her, but he preferred not to do so at least at the present time.

4. After completing his tour of the Secretariat of Education uilding, Subject invited Rowton to view the murals of the Supreme Court Buil-ding on fiño Suarez, which de described as superior even to those of Diego Rivera, especially because of their open defiance of official opinion. On the way Rowton continued to put discreet questions concerning subject's personal life. Subject replied by revealing that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 391

2. 
he lived with his wife and three-year-ol. child in a very small apartment near Jan Angel and shared a studio with another artet.) He added that he was paving 650 pesos menthly rent which he considered very high for what he has getting. He also complained that the artist with whom he was sharing the studio was a dil ettante who was more interested in the atmosphere of the Latin Quarter then in art for its own sake. He said he found it difficult to paint with guitars playing and cocktail glasses clinking in the ackground. Subject then stated that he was looking for a more suitable arrangemont, perhaps in a condominio and preferably in the Tacubaya area.

5. In connection with his own future hopes, Subject stated that he wanted very much to travel to gain as much experience as possible so that his style could be crystalized. He commented that he could move easily to Cuba since his wife's family lived there and he could get along with the Cuban authorities, but he felt lexico was botter for him at the moment. He expressed preference for Sweden, Korth africa and Greece. In reply to kowton's queries, he stated that he did not feel that his daughter would present a problem, since he could leave her in the care of his or his wife's relatives. He added that she was currently attending a Jardin de Niños in the mornings and doing very well despite her tender age.

6. Subject commented also that he likedtravel so much that he had joined the Mexican Navy to see the world. He added that he had been able to visit almost all the potts of the east and west coasts of North and Central America but had not succeeded in seeing Europe as he had hoped. Since Rowton was posing as a Greek, Subject expressed great interest in visiting Athens and the Middle East, and at one point asked Howton how much money he would need to live in Athens for a month as a tourist.. Subject also stated that both he and his wife were anxious to leara English and French so that they could absorb as much local culture as possible in their travels.

7. After inviting Rowton to coffee at a nearby restaurant, subject stated that he had to meet his wife and some friend's for lunch and left Row-ton at about 1335 in front of the Cathedral. He promised to telephone Rowton again so that they could get together before Rost n left the country.

27 April, 1966

Subject: Wallace B Rowton Contact with Mr. and Mrs. Carlos Jurado. (from LITA WT-2)

1. Following a Station lead to the effect that Mrs. Chichay Jurado, who is employed by the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, is the daughter of a Cuban residing in New York City, Rowton visited the Salon de la Plastica Mexicana, Calle Havre 7, where Carlos Jurado's paintings were on exhibit. After several unsuccessful attempts to meet Jurado by chance at the salon, Rowton left his alias and telephone answering service number with the receptionist on 14 April, 1966, and asked that Jurado contact him for a meeting. On 18 April Rowton again visited the salon (having received no message through the answering service) and fortunately met Jurado who had dropped in to pick up messages from the receptionist.

2. Rowton explained that he was interested in Jurado's style, particularly for a mural that might go well in a New York night club owned by a friend of his. Jurado was, of course, immediately interested and commented that he was most anxious to visit New York to see the Museums. In answer to Rowton's query, he stated that he did not have any relatives in New York and had never been outside Mexico. Rowton invited Jurado and his wife to dinner the following evening so that they could discuss the proposed mural. (Rowton planned, if pressed, to use the "La Chansonette" night-club restaurant owned by his Greek friend Rita Dimitri as the prospective client).

3. On 19 April at 1930 Rowton met Jurado at the Salon as planned. Fortunately Jurado had brought his wife Chichay along as Rowton had suggested. Rowton invited them to dinner at the Restaurante &


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 393

2. 
"El 77" at Calle Londres 77. Neither had eaten there previously and appeared delighted at the opportunity to enjoy a good dinner.

4. In the course of conversation, Jurado stated that his wife Chichay was born in Cuba and that they had a three-year old daughter. Neither he nor Chichay made any reference to her employment at the Consulate and "owton did not feel it wise to press too hard on that subject. Howton again asked whether Jurado had any relatives in New York in the event it might be advisable for him to travel there in connection with the mural, but neither he nor his wife responded in the affirmative.

5. Later in the evening, Jurado and his wife strolled clone Niza Calie Niza and Reforma to the Fotel Hilton with Rowton. This gave Rowton an opportunity to sound them out on politics with specific reference to Cuba. Rowton pretended to be of Greek-Irish parentage and more or less neutral in his own politicel views with respect to Cuba. Chichay Jurado stated that she felt Cuba was doing well and that the relovution was the only answer to the corruption that had existed previously. Carlos Jurado agreed, commenting that the "Dorthamerican" position with regard to Cuba was unfortunately erroneous and short-sighted. Rowton placed much of the blame on the former Batista regime but lamented the fact that in the meantime the Cuban people ware suffering from the mistakes of the politicians.

6. While walking along Reforza, Carlos Jurado commented that his wife's father was Chinese but did not indicate where he was then residing. Chichay Jurado stated that she had learned some Cantonese as a child, but did not consider herself proficient in Chinese.

7. Before leaving him for the evening, Carlos Jurado invited Rowton to visit some of the better murals in Mexico City on Saturday, 23 April, and promisedd to telephone Roxton to set the time and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 394

3. 
place of the meeting. He informed Routon that he himself could be contacted on 48 22 66, a telephone that was located near his studio in the Colonia Florida. He asked Routon to obtain as soon as possible the measurements of the proposed mural and photographs of of the owner so that he could make a sample painting.

SUBJECT: Identification of Jorge ARIAS Comes as Salvadoren Delegata to Tri-Continental Conference

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1.  GRICID forwarded to FEWHIS a copy of the 15 February 1966 edition of Politica, a Mexican publication that contained photos of and speeches delivered by the Chiefs of the various dalegations to the Tri-Continental Conference held in Havana in cammary.

2.  "Sergio FLORES", described therein as the Chief of the Salvadoren delegation, was identified from photo by the JHA VE-2 as Jorge ARIAS Comes, a member of the Central Committee of the 13S. According to JHA VE-2, ARIAS is probably the #1 man in the Paris hierarchy - behind Raul INTERIANO? Figueroa, Jorge Shafick Handal, and Salvador Cayetano CARPIO. It is rather strange that the Paris hierarchy - backed Raul.

JHA VE-2 and JHA VE-1 reported that, while in Cuba in 1961-62, ARIAS had an affair with a girl that resulted in her pregnancy, and the Cubans sent a strong complaint to the POD concerning his conduct.

3. A LIVACATE main interest (DIN-21291) indicated that ARIAS was expected in Moscow in January. He apparently has not yet returned to El Salvador, and thus he may also be representing the POD at the 23rd CPUSSR Congress. Any available photos of Salvadoreans at that affair would be appreciated.

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 7

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

## MEMORANDUM

TO: TOM LAMBETH
FROM: KENNETH D. KLEIN
DATE: JUNE 16, 1977
RE: BILL TRIPLETT

It is my recommendation that Bill Triplett be hired as a staff counsel. I interviewed him approximately 5 months ago and he is far superior to almost all of the applicants I have interviewed. His legal background is excellent for our purposes. He has experience as a prosecutor, a defense lawyer and as an investigator. He impressed me as being intelligent, well spoken and as having an easy going manner.

He desires to leave his present position with LEAA due to the lack of challenge. I am certain that this Committee would be gaining a productive member by hiring Mr. Triplett.

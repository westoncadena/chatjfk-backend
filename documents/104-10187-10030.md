ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1. Forwarded under separate cover as Attachment A are two LIENVOY transcripts of 12 November 1963 and two LIENVOY transcripts of 13 November 1963 which Headquarters may consider for transmittal to Station Stockholm.

2. Forwarded under separate cover as Attachment B is a photograph of an unidentified male (who was accompanied by an unidentified female whose photograph the Station asset did not obtain) who visited the Soviet Embassy at 1400 hours on 12 November 1963. The Station believes this male is identical with Subject since the male in the photograph is the only unidentified male who was also accompanied by a woman and, secondly, this male appears to be a nordic type. The Station recognizes, however, that Subject may have only claimed to be a Swede for cover purposes.

3. The following is the comment made by Douglas J. FEINGLASS, the Station's LIEINOY translator, concerning Attachment A:

"The exact spelling of this name could not be determined. He started by saying that it is - W - A - N.. and then stopped, emphasizing the two dots above A. It is very strange that he, belng, a Swede dld not seek the aid of his Swedish Consulate, but applied to the Coviet Na-bassy and asked for a man, whom he met by chance (?) in a restaurant. Cut stronger still is the response of the Embassy officials, who went out of their way to find a chip for him. Usually requests of this nature are brushed aside and quite often in a very rude manner. Judging from his non-British accent and almost flawless English, he rust have lived in the United States or Canada for quite some time." (The Station PEDWOOD officer agrees with FEIIGLASS comment regarding the usual reluctance of Soviet Embassy officials to help in a matter of this type.)

4. Station Mexico has no record of any member of the Soviet Embassy travelling to Oaxaca during this period.

5. Station Mexico has no traces on Subject.

1. Station Mexico regrets the confusion over the status of LIENVOY-8.
   He was terminated 29 February 1960. An Agent Service Record is attached.

2. The cryptonym LIENVOY-8 in HMMA-20408 dated 19 December 1962
   should have been LIENVOY-6. Headquarters noted that LIENVOY-6 had been
   omitted and called this to the attention of the Station in HMMW-11457 dated
   1 April 1963. It was not noticed at that time that LIENVOY-8 had been included
   in error in the project renewal request instead of LIENVOY-6.

20-68-69 Yugoslav Embassy (connected 23 September 1963)
20-68-23 Yugoslav Embassy (connected 23 September 1903)

Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in order to cover three Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were disconnected were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubans. One was in the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by other Cubans. The other was a telephone in the Cuban Embassy which was never answered. The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the Embassy. They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 14-92-14. As soon as these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav Embassy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which are presumed to have a much higher priority.

### 3. Processing of LIENVOY Information

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish on the Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and as of 18 and 25 September the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each morning for the day before. During September, the LIENVOY monitors transcribed 1396 pages in addition to the daily resumen.

The outside translators now working on LIENVOY transcripts are Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, who is used for almost any backlog which begins to occur.

David B. SCHLAGETER, field contract agent, who transcribes the Czech take.

Victor W. OBOLD, career agent, who transcribes the Yugoslav portion of the Yugoslav take.

Douglas I. FEINGLASS, staff agent, who continues to transcribe the Russian language portion of the Soviet take.

### 4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information

Two leads from LIENVOY of operational interest in September 1963 were:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH HMMA-22267

a. On & September 1963 a Russian speaking female contacted the Soviet Embassy and asked for Svyatoslav Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, KGB. She identified herself by name and as a professor from New Orleans. She gave the address of her apartment and asked for a meeting. This lead was promptly followed up by station investigative assets who identified the woman and learned that she was attending a philosophers' conference at the University of Mexico. She returned to the United States on 17 September. All available information was forwarded to Headquarters for passing to ODENVY.

b. MEXI-6135 reported the contact between an unidentified Czech woman and the Czech Embassy.

5. Liaison

On 18 September 1963 Oliver G. GALBOND and Willard C. CURTIS met with LIELEGANT and LIERGO. They also saw LIELEGANT on 20 September.

6. Security

There were no security problems during this month.

7. Technical

There were no technical problems which AREHART could not handle.

8. Personnel

Robert B. RIGGS continues to meet Arnold AREHART each morning before 0800 hours to receive all LIENVOY tapes and trascripta from the previous day. The daily meetings with Victor W. OBOLD and David B. SCHLAGETER, the two EE translators, Wertransferred on 18 September 1963 from the Station EE case officer to the KURIOT technician, Gregory D. PARMUTH who delivers and receives reels and transcripts from them each day. PARMUTH also acts as a cutout for Douglas J. FEINGLASS.

Paul V. LEVISTER, Headquarters KUTUBE officer, visited the Station from 22 September to 1 October to consult with LIENVOY and LIFEAT case officers in preparation for a report to be written on the two projects as examples of tap operations which produce both positive intelligence and operational leads.

9. Production

There is attached a list of reports, cables and dispatches forwarded to Headquarters during this month.

# PERSONALITY BRIEF

1.  General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio

As a pro-Communist, anti-United States former (1934-1940) President of Mexico, CARDENAS plays an important role in the political activities of Mexico by virtue of his being the spirtual leader of a great part of the Mexican left. His leftist sympathies appear to fall primarily with the current regime in Cuba (He alledgedly is a close personal friend of Fidel CASTRO), secondarily with Communist China, and lastly with the USSR.

2.  Braulio MALDONADO Sandez

MALDONADO is a politically unscrupulous pro-Communist former Governor of Baja California. He is a national leader of at least three Mexican leftist organizations: (1) FEP (People's Electoral Front), united single front of Mexican Communists and Leftists; (2) MLN (National Liberation Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Cuba Communist Front; and (3) CCI (Independent Peasants' Center), radical, anti-Mexican Government organization. Having been banished from Mexico until after the 1964 elections for anti-government activities, MALDONADO is currently in Europe and seeking admittance to the USSR, obstensibly to visit his daughter who is a student at the Friendship University in Moscow.

3.  Alonso AGUILAR Monteverde

AGUILAR is a prominent pro-Communist Mexican intellectual who is the titular head of the MLN (National Liberation Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Communist front. He is a full-time professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and maintains active contact with several international leftist and Communist figures. He has recently travelled to Cuba and Warsaw.

4.  Jorge Leonidas TAMAYO Castillejos

TAMAYO is a Communist professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He is a leading member of many Communist front activities in Mexico including the CMP (Mexican Peace


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

-2-

Committee), the MLN (National Liberation Movement), and the CEM (Circle of Mexican Studies). He has been in contact with several leftist figures of various echelon, including Gen. Lazaro CARDENAS, the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, and Polish, Soviet, and Chinese Communist officials. TAMAYO's son has studied in Warsaw and travelled to the USSR and Communist China.

5. Jose David ALFARO Siqueiros

ALFARO, one of Mexico's most prominent artists, has been imprisoned for eight (S) years as a consequence of the role he played in the Communist-inspired railroad stike of 1959, He is a leader of the PCM (Mexican Communist Party) and has visited the Soviet Union. He fought for the Loyalist Army in the Spanish Civil War and was later arrested in Mexico for complicity in the murder of Leon TROTSKY's secretary. ALFARO has a long history of pro-Communist, anti-U.S. leanings.

6. Roberto ROMERO Adams

ROMERO is an informant for the Cuban Intelligence Service in Mexico.

7. Enrique GONZALEZ Pedrero

Pro-Communist professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, GONZALEZ Pedrero has contributed to the writing or editing of at least five (5) leftist publications in Mexico. He is a member of the National Committee of the MLN, has alledgedly received training in the Soviet Union, and has travelled to Cuba twice in recent times.

8. Ignacio ACOSTA Lagunes

Pro-Communist ACOSTA, a lawyer, is an aide of General CARDENAS and a leading member of the MLN. He frequently has contact with high-level personnel of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City. Ilis political activities include travel to Cuba and the Soviet Union, aid in the management of the Communist Trade Fair in Mexico, and a great deal of participation in promoting sympathy for the Cuban Revolution in Mexico.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad - Federal Security Police

The principal functions of this security unit are to:
(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,
(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both
the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and
(3) perform investigations and arrests of primarily political
offenses. The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,
insecure, and unreliable. Their professional characteristics
are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.
The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as
Director General of DFS is precarious.

10. Politica

A Marxist anti-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in
Mexico, Politica is printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,
the same shop which prints La Voz de Mexico. In addition to
the modest revenues derived from a circulation of 15,000
to 25,000, Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the
MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy. As an
indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the
capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it
is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a
great degree of difficulty in printing and circulating itself
due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,
the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual
interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the
ranks of the PRI, the PPS, the PCM, the CNC and the UGOCM.
The MLN's objective is to gain leftist political represen-
tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists
into its camp. As a consequence of this objective, the mission
of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy
by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and
peasant masses.

12. Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)

The CTAL has recently been replaced by the CUTAL (Single
Confederation of Latin American Workers). Until recently, the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

pro-Communist, CTAL, which is described as being the liaison bureau of the WFTU (World Federation of Trade Unions) whose headquarters are in Prague, was headed by Vicente LOMBARDO Toledano.

13. Prensa Latina

Operating directly under the Cuban Communist regime, Prensa Latina is obstensibly a press service. In reality, however, it is the official propaganda organ of the Cuban Government. Prensa Latina works closely with Tass, the Soviet Agency; with Hsinhua, the Chinese Agency; and with Cetepka, the Czechoslovakian Agency.

B. HMM-22262, 3 October 1963

1. Reference is made to your question about the type informa-
   tion needed on GUTIERREZ. Headquarters is interested in "current"
   information on his activities, and especially on his travels and his
   contact with Samuel VEGA Perez, Chief of G-2 at the Cuban Embassy
   in Mexico City. The comment on HMM-7289 regarded only the non-
   dissemination of the report, and was not intended to discourage the
   Station from reporting information on meetings between GUTIERREZ
   and VEGA.

2. Headquarters would appreciate receiving, on a continuing
   basis, pertinent information on GUTIERREZ extracted from the
   LISNVOT take.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence

SUBJECT: TDY to Mexico City

1.  After taking a good look at LIENVOY and LIFEAT, I would agree with the persons I talked with in Mexico; they maintain that any well- run tap operation should produce substantial intelligence information, provided the targets are of intelligence interest, and provided also there are people at the station who look for it and are able to recognize it. The case of LIFEAT is interesting in this respect. It has been deprived of its most productive lines in favor of LIENVOY, and yet its intelligence production compares favorably, with that of the other productive taps, except LIENVOY.

2.  Mexico has people who can detect any little item of intelligence significance. This includes the Chief of Station, who goes over the highlights of the previous day's take every morning and marks certain items for action by station case officers or reports officers. The reports officers work on copies of the take at the same time.

3.  There are several aspects of LIENVOY that make it an excellent operation and an outstanding producer of intelligence. I will describe them in detail when my notes get here from the station. The principal factors in the success of LIENVOY seem to be the following.

a. The agreement made with top Maxican officials, unlike many such agreements elsewhere, is as much in effect today as it was at the start: the targeting is not based on personal politics; the intercept staff has stayed on the job; the equipment is considered to be on loan from CIA.

b. The native monitoring staff has reached a peak of effectiveness that everyone at the station praises very highly.

c. The station is organized to handle the take speedily a8 soon as it comes in. The Chief of Station, the case officers, the reports officers, all work on it at the same time and exchange views on hot items. They do not let reports backlogs accumulate.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 16

d. Each new item on a target person is linked to a past history; what appears as a fragmentary bit in a conversation becomes a meaningful development in a continuous story. Continuity on the job makes this possible.

e. The equipment is kept in good working order by complete cleaning and checking of each unit once a month. The 32 units in use today are those installed in 1959.

4. A detailed description of LIENVOY and its counterpart LIFEAT should provide good models with which to compare other tap operations. It should give criteria for good procedures. It should give some idea of the desirable size of such operations, considering the available targets, the size of the station, and the other tasks and operations of the station. It should show what the station puts into its tap operations and what it gets out of then. LIENVOY and LIFEAT are an interesting example of two interacting operations, one Joint and the other independent.

5. My stay in Mexico was as interesting and fruitful as it was enjoyable. And I hope it was not too great a burden on the station.

# DISPATCH

TO Chief, WH Division

FROM Chief-of-Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT Monthly Operational Report for Project LIENVOY

Action: None. For Headquarters' information.

Ref : HMMA-22005, 23 August 1963

1. There follows the monthly operational report for Project LIENVOY activities during August 1963.

2. Target Lines - August 1963.

There were no changes in the target lines during this reporting period. The Yugoslav lines have not yet been connected but one of them should be operating by the end of September.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information.

HMMA-22000 dated 21 August 1963 transmitted the first group of copies of transcripts against the Cuban lines. Since that time, carbon copies have been forwarded to Headquarters on a weekly basis.

Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, has eliminated the backlog of some fifty reels from the Russian lines and at the present time is working on the Polish LIFFAT coverage which Woodrow GABFOTT (ps) has not been able to handle. HORSFALL will be used in this capacity only until the Station has a higher priority job for him or until his permanent assignment is determined.

There has been no change in Douglas J. FEINGLASS' assignment since the last progress report.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information.

The following are some (not all) of the exploitations during August 1963 of leads from LIENVOY:

a. LIENVOY contributed support to the REDWOOD ARJUMBO operation during this period by confirming several contacts between the principals involved. Details of this case have been reported by the Station SR Case Officer.

b. On 8 August LIENVOY reported indications that an unnamed


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

IMMA-22135

DIZTAG diplomat stationed in Caracas planned to travel alone by plane to Mexico City via Panama carrying a diplomatie pouch for turnover in Mexico and return to Caracas with diplomatic mail received from DIZTAG couriers in Mexico. This was reported to Headquarters, Carmens, and Panama as a possible opportunity to obtain or copy these pouches. (M-XI-5681)

c. On 7 August this project revealed contact between the Partido Popular Socialista and the Soviet Embassy. Roberto JARAMILLO Flores, national leader of the Juventud Popular Socialista, the youth organization of the Marxist Partido Popular Socialista, arranged for an urgent meeting with Nikolaiy Sergeyevich LEONCV, Third Secretary and Cultural Officer of the Soviet Embassy. It will be recalled that LEONOV went to the Soviet Union and acted as interpreter for Fidel CASTRO on his visit there earlier this year. MEXI-5705 transmitted a report on JARAMILLO's contact with LEONOV.

d. On 5 August LIENVOY reported the presence in Mexico of one Doctor Paul BARAN who was in contact with Cuban Embassy officials and prom- inent Mexican Marxist intellectuals. BARAN appeared to be on a trip throughout South America. A check of Station files revealed that this was probably identical with Paul Alexander BARAN, Russian born naturalized U. S. citizen and professor of economics at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. BARAN has visited Mexico in the past and made contact with American Communists and Mexican leftists. This information was sent to Headquarters in MEXI-5735 for dissemination to ODENVY.

e. On 12 August William ROSE, who identified himself as a student from the United States studying at the University of Mexico (UNAM) asked for an interview with Vicente LOMBARDO Toledano, Secretary General of the Popular Socialist Party (PPS). ROSE claimed to have letters of Introduction to LOMBARDO from labor leaders in the United States. A check of Station files revealed William Maurice ROSE, 1474 Federal Way, Salt Lake City, Utah, as a student at the UNAM. This report was sent to Headquarters in MEXI-5752 for dissemination to ODENVY.

f. On 1 August Henry WALLSCHMIDT, 3662 Carrington Avenue, Los Angeles, California, contacted the Soviet Embassy and volunteered his ser vices to them. The detalls of this contact were forwarded to Headquarters via HMMA-21905 for dissemination to ODEJIVY.

g. On 7 August a person who claimed to be a U.S. citizen with a name which sounded like ARNFRO contacted the Soviec Embassy and referred to a previous visit at the Embassy when he discussed information on ship movements. He also asked for asylum and made an appointment to sce Oleg NECHIPORFNKO, Soviet Vice Consul and KGB officer. A pereen of American appearance was photographed by LIEMPTY at the time of the arranged appointment. A sanitized copy of this photograph together with information from LIENVOY was passed locally to ODENVY. MEXI-5784 forwarded the report to Headquarters.

h. On 9 August LIENVOY reported that an American pilot with wife and emall son were at the Cuban Embassy trying to get a visa to go to Cuba. MEXI-5794 reported details for Headquarters. ODENVY was advised locally after receiving Headquarters' authorization.

i. LIFNVOY covered the activities of Parry Terry PRIMUS, New York actor who was expelled from Mexico on 19 August for participating in Marzist- Communist public disturbances on 18 August. See MEXI-5854 and 5855 for further details.

j. On 20 August Moe FISHMAN, Secretary of Veterans of the Lincoln Brigade in the U.S. asked the wife of David Alfaro SIQUEIROS how the Brigade could help free SIQUEIROS. FISHMAN also made an appointment to meet with Margarita NELKEN, prominent Spanish Communist exile. MYI-5864 transmitted this report to Headquarters for dissemination to ODENVY.

5. Liaisen.

As reported in reference Willard C. CURTIS met with LITENSOR to arrange for a sensitive PRRUMEN case on 15 August 1963. The case is still pending.

LIENVOY ops
13. September 1963

Mr. Whitten:

I just learned that Mr. George sent his note to Mr. Scott directly to Colonel Kuig. The note mentions -my pseudo, Paul V. Levister.
Perhaps Col. Kuig would want to jot down my true name somewhere, GERARD CAMPAGNA.

I read our LIENVOY project file yesterday and got excellent additional information from Try Puckett. It's always encouraging to get into such good operations

Jerry Campagna

Next week I would like to read further into LIENVOY and LIFCAT, especially the monthly reports and the disseminated reports.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

12 September 1963

Dear Billard:

This may seem to you like a voice out of the void, but I always carry in my mind your repeated invitations to visit you and remember clearly your acquaintance and kindness to my brother. Strangely enough it seems to continue to be true that the only escape from this jail-like desk is back to my old area where I never expected to return--I even had one this Spring. Just now I have a specific reason for wanting to visit your place, that is, in addition to our own personal reasons.

For some time I have been bent on trying to push for sora positive information from taps and audio. I realize that it is taken for granted around the world that the purpose of taps and audio is for operational leads, particularly in the KUDESK field.

In one or two places in the world, positive production is outstanding and we have been making a study for some time trying to see why it works in some cases and not in others. One of the outstanding examples is LIFEAT and especially LIENΤΟΥ. These seem to be far ahead of other similar operations around the world even though they seem to approach the problem somewhat similarly. It occurred to me that wo might find out what makes yours so especially effective by having one of my people go to your station for a few days to talk with you and your officers and get the detailed story. I could then take another look at the other operations and see what's missing or what's wrong. I'm sure this would be of great help to the place as a whole. If you agres, I will send Paul V. Levister (Iden), the editor of our Foreign Intelligence Series (our Staff doctrinal papers, the first few of which have been dispatched to you). He could be in Mexico City on or about 23 September, or any time thereafter that is more convenient for you and your peoplo. Could you let us know your reaction by cable, and if it's favorable, when you would prefer to have Levister arrive. We would confirm his ETA by cable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

Galbond is leaving tomorrow to make a visit down your
way and I have asked him to be kind enough to pass this to you.
The desk here concurs in our interest subject to your approval.

On 7 August 1963 the Station EE case officer requested LIENVOY coverage of the Yugoslav lines. Arrangements are being made to put these lines in within the near future.

### 3. Processing of LIENVOY Information.

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish from ten lines (five Cuban Embassy and five Soviet Embassy). DIR-60764 dated 13 August 1963 asked the Station to send to Headquarters one copy of the full transcripts from the Cuban Embassy lines. These are being forwarded on a weekly basis. The first group is being forwarded as an attachment to HMMA-22000 dated 21 August 1963. If they do not please Headquarters officers who desire them, it is requested that the Mexico Station be promptly advised with any suggestions for changes.

On 6 August 1963 Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, arrived in Mexico to work presently as a unilateral monitor but eventually as the supervisor of a tap center either under LIENVOY or LITEMPO. He has established himself outside and is presently at work eliminating the backlog of Soviet tapes.

Douglas J. FEINGLASS continues to do the Russian from LIENVOY, the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from the LIPAWN audio operation. In addition, FEINGLASS sends clipped transcripts to the Station ready for 201 files.

### 4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information.

HMMW-11831 dated 6 August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was not well informed on the way the Mexico Station exploits operational leads from LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART has instructions to alert the Station immediately if a U.S. citizen or English speaking person tries to contact any of the target installations. This is done by a telephone call from outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B. RIGGS inside the Station. Emergency meetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch). RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a pre-arranged downtown location and receives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation. The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters is notified by cable of the action taken. Only in rare cases is information on a U.S. citizen passed without prior Headquarters approval.

IMMA-22005

Other leads appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen. They
also are exploited by the Station case officer responsible for the target where
the lead appears. For example, on 12 August 1903 Boris KAZANTSEV,
recently arrived Counselor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target
in Mexico, called his wife at their residence. The number was not listed but
was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the
number was the switchboard of theapartment house where KAZANTSEV and
several other families live. The reason the Station checked out this number
was to put unilateral coverage on it if possible; however, the switchboard was
beyond the Station's capability tohandle.

Maryknoll priest Felix McGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on
31 July 1963. MEXI-5565 reported details of this contact. This cable was sent
to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Professor WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louisiana contacted Mexican
Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel-
lectual and professor at the University of Mexico and arranged to meet with
him on 31 July 1963. MEXI-5568 reported this contact to Headquarters for
dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Bartolo (fnu) contacted former Governor of Baja California, Braulio
MALDONADO Sandez on 16 July 1963 regarding the sale of Cuban pesos. ΜΕΧΙ-5569
reported this contact to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

5. Liaison

On 15 August 1963 Willard C. CURTIS met with LITENSOR to arrange
for a sensitive PBRUMEN case (MEXI-5789 reported the details of this meeting).

6. Security

There were no security incidents within the project during this month.

7. Technical

There were no technical probleins during this period.

8. Personnel

Orville HORSFALL's arrival is the only change in personnel since the
last report and he is handled as an independent agent by the Station, with no
LIENVOY personnel aware of his presence in Mexico. Robert B. RIGGS sees
HORSFALL daily to deliver and pick up tapes.

9. Production

There is attached a list of reports, cables and dispatches forwarded
to Headquarters during this month.

SUBJECT

Chief, WHD

PRRUMEN/LIENVOY

ACTION SEQUINED HEFERENCES

References: A. MEXI 5648

B: MEXI 5487

1.  The referenced cables describe two recent incidents in which the Mexico City Station made use of LIENVOY information to take investigative or punitive action against security suspects. The first reference reported the identifying and "trapping" of a PBPRIME citizen who was offering his services to the Cuban Embassy, and the second reported the deporting of a Cuban IS agent identified by LIENVOY material.

2.  In both of these cases, there seems to have been departure from the extreme caution with which the Mexico Station has always handled the LIENVOY material. Admitting that the cables do not set out enough facts to enable us to make a final judgment, we still feel a little uneasy bout this use of LIENVOY material. In the first case, the Station sent an agent to the suspect's hotel, posing as a Cuban Embassy official to "trap" him into revealing his intentions. The scheme, which was admittedly clever, succeeded, but we were concerned about what would have happened if the Cubans themselves had decided to contact the individual. Would not the LIENVOY operation have been exposed to some extent? We grant that the Cubans and other bloc personnel in Mexico City may suspect LIENVOY exists, but they do not know it --- yet. Incidentally, we had no traces on the PBPRIMER involved.

3.  The second case involved the detection, spprehension and deportation of a Cuban Is agent whose whereabouts were learned through LIENVOY. From the few facts we know about this case, we cannot really judge the possible risk to LIENVOY. The Mexico Station created LIENVOY and has always guarded its security with scrupulous care. Has there been a change?

4.  Finally, please note that both these cases should have been reported to Headquarters before action was taken. In general, arresto, deportation, trapping, or other action against security suspects should be approved by Headquarters, except where in the opinion of the Chief of Station, the added time needed would seriously impair ODYOKE security or the security of our operations. The Mexico Station has always done this, and the coincidence of two recent cases where it was not done inspires us to query you. Please let us know your views.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information.

Of the lines covered, all are of interest to KUBARK and approximate ly one half of thein are exclusively for KUBARK. The LIENVOY tap center monitors continue to prepare daily summaries of significant items from all lines. In addition, they prepare full transcripts in Spanish for ten lines (five Cuban Embassy lines and five Soviet Embassy lines). These transcripts are used by the Station Case Officers for Cuban and Soviet operations in following leads of interest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
SECRET
HIMMA-21845

On 5 June 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Staff Agent, arrived in Mexico to replace Howard G. SAFARANO, the Station translator for Russian language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines, SAFARANO departed PCS on 18 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations officer, FEINGLASS' usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Soviet coverage. This, despite Headquarters assurance that he could do these transcriptions. However, he has settled into outside living conditions with a minimum of difficulty.

For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing the Spanish portion of the above take. There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish. The backlog is being retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. In addition to the Russian trans- crptions, FEINGLASS also ellps the transcripts for individual dossiers thus relieving the Station Case Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task. After the arrival of HORSFALL. the Mexico Station will review requirements for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of FEINGLASS.

In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines. In addition, Thomas G. URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the LIENVOY tap center to review the traffic on a current basis.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY information.

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data. In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance information when reservations were made. Confirmation of the travel is, of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might be U. S. citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for political or other reasons. On 20 May 1963 an English speaker identifying himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political asylum for himself, his wife and seven children. Subsequent investigation revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. Appropriate U. S. agencies were advised of Subject's contact with the Soviet Embassy.

5. Liaison.

During this reporting period there were no meetings between the Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular contact was maintained with LIELEGANT and LIERGO.

6. Security.

There were no security incidents within the project during this month. As reported in MEXI-5170, 26 June 1963, the true name of a KUBARK case officer was revealed to the Cuban Embassy by a caller who refused to identify himself. From the transcript it appeared that the Cuban Embassy was not interested in making contact with the caller who claimed to have details of KUBARK operations in Mexico,

effectively. As Headquarters is being advised by separate cable, the Mexico
Station does not plan to replace the present LIENVOY equipment until the next
Presidential candidate is named, assuming of course that this will occur within
the next few weeks.

S. Personnel,

On 17 June Robert B. RIGGS resumed meeting Arnold AREHART and
routine case officer functions for LIENVOY, Gregory PARMUTH meets
Douglas J. FEINGLASS daily to deliver and receive the Soviet Embassy
traffic. PARMUTH's assistance in obtaining living quarters and necessary
sterile office furniture was responsible for the case with which FEINGLASS
was able to settle into his outside staff agent status.

In the opinion of Thomas G. URQUHART, who has spent some time
Inside the tap center, Arnold F. AREHART is doing a commendable job in
the management of the center. In addition, AREHART has a general aware-
ness of the take from each line. When leads of Interest appear, he notifies
the Station immediately so that action can be taken,

Willard C. CURTIS contacts LIENVOY-2 when the Station desires
contact with the Mexicans directly or when AREHART is absent,

9. Production,

The volume of paper produced by this project is hardly reflected in
formal disseminations, operational cables, and dispatches which numbered
39 during June. The daily summaries, the transcripts from two Czech lines,
five Soviet lines, and five Cuban lines are retained for background use in
Starton files. They could be more fully exploited for reporting purposes if
personnel were available.

There is attached a list of reports, cables and dispatches forwarded
to Headquarters during this month,

# RESUMEN

Viernes 10 may. 1965

*53154:* Dice que como no. Anota que insistió en que quiere una colección completa de la Revista Política, pero parece que sólo hay ya encuadernado. RAFAEL va a ver eso. ARAYA pasará por las oficinas de la Revista hoy a las 16:30 hs.

16:00 RAFAEL ayudante del Lic. BOLIVAR mandó por la imprenta Laura, sita en Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl 145-A si el libro del Lic. MALDONADO ya ha sido empezado. El sobrino del Sr. DIAZ informa que ya y que pueden mandar a recoger una muestra para que lo lea, corrija y dé su autorización, además de que necesita le mande algo de dinero.

17:52 FUMAT MUNOZ pide a MANCIC, del Consulado de Cuba en Veracruz que tome nota de que en comunicación num. 05851 de fecha 6 de mayo se le concedió visa de turista a AIDIA GUADALUPE MIJAL CAMASCO SOLIS. Cambiando de tema MATEU irá a pasar el domingo a Veracruz pues "no hace falta ver a ni gente", por tal motivo saldrá el sábado en la noche en el autobus y regresará el domingo en la noche por avión, tomar cosa nota de todo.

18:10 El LICENCIADO SALMERON comentó con MARIA TERESA ARGUELLES que ayer tocó parte en una Mesa Redonda, que él en principio creyó se trataba de una conferencia solamente, pero resultó que como a las 5 de la tarde lo llamaron para recordarle que debería asistir a la Mesa Redonda. En fin así lo hizo y no obstante que en el mediodía se sintió enfermo al salir del Instituto Francés ya se sintió perfectamente. Agrega que él nunca en su vida había ido a dicho Instituto y tenía interés en ver qué clase de público asistía y cuando fue su sorpresa al ver allí a SILVA HERZOG, NADER y FRANCISCO y unos cinco o seis historiadores pero afortunadamente todo salió bien.

18:15 ARRIAGA del periódico EL DIA tiene interés en saber que respondió el Lic. MALDONADO de concederle una entrevista. MARIA después de consultar indica que el Licenciado saldrá de la ciudad a descansar y que el lunes le recogerá a las 13:00 hs.

18:24 WOLDE pregunta a MARIA sobre el si el documento que hicieron esta mañana los cogieron o fue revisado por "el maestro". MARIA no sabe y comunica a NADER con su opinión. ADRIANA pregunta que si va a ir a ver a eso señor. NADER responde que lo hallaron para pedirle su opinión sobre el asunto y que él tiene la impresión de que SULIKOWSKI ha polemizado, pero que tal vez lo haya mandado llamar para preguntarle cuáles son sus pretensiones y le ofrezca algún otro. Probablemente le pregunten qué extensión necesita. NADER pregunta que si quiere que le mande esos datos. LOBATO dice

que no esnecesario que solamente se les dé por teléfono. ADRIANA indica que se necesiten dos salones, uno para teatro y cine y otro para conferencias, por lo zemes 10 salones de clase, otro cuarto para biblioteca y lo que es indispensable es un salón para les compañeros que viene de fuera a estudiar. los cursos intensivos, pues "el año pasado tuvimos en un cuarto de 3x3 a calle compañeros". LOMBARDO toma nota de todo esto. Cambiando de tema ADRIANA informa que hoy en la mañana hablé con el Lic. y este le dijo que no había tenido oportunidad de entregar el oficio así que ADRIANA sugiere a su papa que llame al Lic.

A las 18:05 ESTELA AGUILAR preguntó a ESTELA AGUILAR por ALONSO. ESTELA informó que salió hace un momento, que iba a poner gasolina al coche y de allí iba al M.L.M. donde tenía una cita. GARCIA dice que no ha llegado al Movimiento, pues incluso no hay quien abra las oficinas. ESTELA se alarma. Posteriormente ESTELA ha estado tratando de comunicarse a las oficinas del H.L.M. sin lograrlo. A las 20:33 CARICHA vuelve a preguntar a ESTELA por ALONSO. ESTELA indica que no lo ha localizado y que él tampoco ha llamado a la casa y esto ya la está preocupando, agregando que esperará una hora más.

10:40 RAMIREZ con acento centroamericano pregunta a avión de la
Brigada de Cuba que si en el avión de ayer no llevó nada nuevo
de su viaje. VAD sin contestar a su pregunta le indica que
vaya a la Embajada, pero que adelante media hora a la que
habían fijado. Ramirez allí estará.

12:10 RAQUEL necesita con urgencia para el próximo número de reflej
os fotografías de las reuniones que ha habido en la Asociación
Mexicana de periodistas en relación a la paz y demás todos
los discursos de FIDEL CASTRO en Rusia. Con relación a lo
primero 30.000US se las proporcionará. Con respecto a lo segun
do ALBURU procurará conseguírselos y en caso contrario sugiere
a RAQUEL se ponga en contacto con SANTA en su casa.
Posteriormente SANTA indica que ya le tiene
una revista Bohemia y dos periódicos cubanos que contienen al
gunos de los discursos de FIDEL en Rusia, solo que se les faci
litará en calidad de préstamo pues son de TALCO FRANCA.
RAQUEL mandará $$$ por el material

13:39 La Dra. MATILDE ROSSELLO pregunta a MARTHA AGUILAR que
si no sabe si el Doctor PANZARRILLO es miembro del M.L.N.
Que
de antier lo sacaron de su cuarto en el hospital Colonia unos
agentes de la procuraduría y se lo llevaron, incluso del mismo
hospital se han interesado mucho por su paradero pero no han sa
bido nada. ESPADA dice que ese nombre no le suena, pero de
todos maneras lo pondrá en conocimiento de ALONSO.

15:53 FRONT HAY, de la Embajada Cubana, se comunica con el gachu
FINLAY y le indica que lo han destinado nuevamente
a Sui; que lo han ascendido y está mejor en todo sentido;
llegó ayer procedente de Suiza; agrega que ha estado tratando
de comunicarse con ANTONIO, pero no le contestan en
el banco; y pregunta que si siguen reuniendo los miércoles.
CMOS responde que sí. FINLAY irá el próximo miércoles para
reunirse con los amigos.

20:34 FERNANDO de la MORENA pregunta a ANGELICA de ALMEIDA que cómo
se encuentra DAVID. ANGELICA dice que más o menos pasándole,
pues no hay ninguna cosa ni ninguna novedad por el momento.
Simona comenta que "por cierto la semana que entra quiero
ver si publicamos ese papel de que te decía; todo depende de
que podamos juntar los centavos". Cambiando de tema dice que
sería bueno que DAVID tuviera en la celda uno de esos apara
tos inalámbricos "Wally Talky" para poder comunicarse con to
dos. ANGELICA pregunta que si realmente se podría. Chenta
co lo sabe bien, pero sería cosa de que ANGELICA lo consult
ara con un amigo que sepa; por ejemplo el hijo de MANUEL
RIZIBAL, que es un buen electrónico, pues a lo mejor si se
da. Agrega que esos aparatos tienen un radio como de 5 millas.

metros. ANGELICA dice que le alcanzaría hasta la cara y se-
ría fantástico; lo malo es que estaría hablando todo el tiempo
çe y ya no habría ni acción mi trabajo porque ella iba a es-
terle preguntando a cada rato que cómo se sentía. CARMONA
cree que sí habría acción, pues DAVID a cada rato estaría pre
guntando qué pasó con el abogado; qué pasó con CAMMONA; qué
paso con ALONSO, etc. ANGELICA dice que sería tremendo; pero
si además le arreglaran un sistema para que DAVID "hablara
con todos ustedes!". CARMONA comenta que si éso fuera posi-
ble, ya sería lo de menos. ANGELICA cambia de tema e indica
que de todas maneras quisiera platicar con CARMONA la semana
entrante, porque DAVID insiste en una serie de cosas, desde
el punto de vista de la cosa electoral, y ANGELICA quisiera
cambiar impresiones. CARMONA arguye que "nosotros tenemos
una posición allí que ojalá que él entienda mejor". ANGELICA
aumenta que independientemente de éso, élla cree que sí hay
algo que se puede hacer. CARMONA dice que "estamos en la
enésima fase de reorganización; pero es que no tiene remedio;
eso hay que entenderle; en ésto hay que armarse de paciencia:
algunos compañeros pierden la paciencia, de los nuestros
mismos muy buenos, como MONTANO por ejemplo.....yo hesta le
decía: mire Docter, cien mil veces hemos-examinado estar co
sas y doscientos mil m's las veces a tener que examinar si
no las resolvemos bien; éso no tiene remedio". ANGELICA de
todas maneras quisiera conversar con CARMONA. ARGUYE
que "pero estamos en pleno proceso de reorganización y espero
que en dos o tres semanas se va a sentir ésto, a partir
del mes que entra yo no voy a hacer cargo del periódico, con
el ánimo de hacerlo muy modesto pero que salga quincun-icon
te". ANGELICA dice que éso será formidable, y a ver si la
semana entrante se ven un ratito, pues élla le quiere plan
tear algunas cosas bastante interesantes. CARMONA acepta

MANUEL CAMACHO, desde Calexico, Calif., quiere comunicarse
con BRAULIO MALDONADO. Con la esposa dice que éste no se
encuentra en la capital. MANUEL dice que llegó con felicidad
y llamaba a BRAULIO para ver si éste ya se comunicó con el
JAMES a Casas Grandes, Arizona, pues es muy urgente que csí
lo haga "y me escriba a mi lo más pronto que pueda para ver
si le dijo el JAMES lo que yo le digo en la carta que le mán
de". CARMONA dice que BRAULIO ya recibió su carta, pero que
va a estar fuera de México unos 10 días. MANUEL dice en es
tán puestos para lo que sea. CARLOT: indica que por allá
ha mandado BRAULIO varias propaganda, folletos y todo éso.
MANUEL dice que está bien, pues él necesita de éso. Termina
deseándoles buena suerte.

Una mujer que dice llamar desde el Restaurante Janimio en
Culiacán, manifiesta que [NAME] quiere hablar con
BRAULIO MALDONADO. CAMMONA indica que está fuera de la ciu

2.  A copy of this dispatch with attachment is being sent to COS Panama at his request because of that Station's interest in ARELLANO.

HIGHLIGHTS OF LIENVOY COVERAGE OF CUBAN

EMBASSY, EARLY APRIL 1963

2 or 3 April 63

A man whose name sounds like "Specia" calls Vega, says he must see him very urgently. They will meet at 1400 or 1430.

Victor Rico Galan holds what appears to be social chatter with Sinobas. They mention a mutual friend (unnamed) and note things are getting better.

A man identified only as Horacio calls Buenaventura (Reyes). They talk about hotels and agres to meet at the Embassy at 1730.

The Bolivian Embassy calls for Sinobas about the case of a man named Arrelleno or Arellano. Sinobas is out. Bolivian Embassy asks to be called back at telephone 14 00 56.

(Comment: Arrellano is of special interest to PACY)

Maria Lourdes de la Fena calls for Teresa Proensa, who is out. On a further conversation mention is made of Maria Elena (Vazquez Gomez?) and the two parties agree to mest at 2030 at some place located at the corner of Hamburgo and Genova.

Teresa Proenza calls to the fronton for Jose Luis "Azamendi" (probably a jai-alai player). He is cut. She leaves a message for him that there is a letter for him at the Cuban Embassy for his daughter and he can come for it.

Vicente Rojo calls Froensa about the bulletin. An envelope was left at the Embassy gate.

Mirna Torres calles Buenaventura Royes and they hold a sociable talk. She wants to send a package and letter (probably to Cuba) and they discuss the arrival of the plane 6 April. She says she will bring the things to the Embassy before that.

The Bolivian Embassy calls for Sinobas. He is out. (This probably has to do with the Arellano case).

Misa Nomes Sanches calls for Sinobas, who is out.

Dr. Jaime Brana (visiting Cuban doctor) calls Hotel Carmen room 40 for someone and gots no answer. He then asks for the Cuban murse in apt. 5, whose nase is Graciela "Guty". She is also out. Brana says he wants to speak with Harta Valdoz, something about the medical congress.

Arana calls Dr. Fausto frejo, with whom he scams to have some social relationship. Trejo is out. Arana asks the woman who answers if he left a Czech notebook from KOVO firm at their home. She looks and says who does not see it there.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

## 2

Quillermo Comes calls for Vega. Oomes is the man who left a letter this morning, which was a letter Vega asked for. Their business seems to have to do with passport and visa details. Coses travels a lot and will call back when in town, possibly tomorrow.

A number of calls show that Hoberto Jorrin, the gate man, has a local girlfriend he sees quite often and who also visits him at the Embassy. Her name is not knom.

## 4 April 1963

Elena Vasques Ocues and Teresa Proenza agreed to dine this evening.

Teresa Proensa spoke to someone about a passage to Cuba for one Margarita Calderon.

Celia Pascual, telephone 25 10 32, describing herself as the sister of Sara, calla Teresa Frosara, Celia says she can take some things over to "Edith" when she goes (presumably to Cuba). Someone's mother is sick.

(Comront: This could refer to Edith Buchaos, whose preoccupation with her mother has been noted in the past).

## 5 April 1963

Ascue in Havan calis Hariano Garcia. The connection is very poor and the Havana end is hard to understand. They mention travel approval for Rafael (?) Hernandes at telephone 35 44 35 and mention something was arranged for Eduardo Rodrigues de la Vega.

A woman identifying herself only as Socorro calls for Voga about a matter she says ha already knows of. He is out.

An American or Canadian calls long distance and says he plans to leave wherever he is, probably Los Angeles, Cal., via Western Airlines, for Mexico.

Immediately after this call someons in the Embassy mentions reservations for Fred Brown fran Canada,

Sinobas calls Tomas Harentes, who is out. Sinoban leaves the message that "Ramon called". (rentes may be the former Governor of Yucatan. He has a plan to send money ar passages to someone in Cuba. Sincbas is very anxious to help him and makes a lot of calls about how to do it. Marentes has told Sinobas he has a son weriding for Humberto Rosero at the Presidencia, indicating the son la at Sinobas's disposition. How much this is a matter of mere courtesy could not be determined).

Arellano (the Solivian deal) calls for Sinobas, who is cut, and then asks for Vega. He asks Vega if there is any news, and Vega tells him to drop by on 7 April.

Hias Comes Arias calls for Sinobas. He is out but will be right back.

# SECRET

3

Sinobas calls the Bolivian Ambassador about Arellano, who is going to travel from one country to another.

6 April 1963

No conversations of salient interest noted.

7 April 1963

Largoly takon up with several conversations between Jorrin and his girl- friend.

8 Apr11 1963

Angel Hidalgo calls in for Vega, who is out. It appears Hidalgo and a couple of others are to drop by the Embassy in connection with passports and visas.

An unidentified man inside calls Cubana de Aviation about a Canadian nazed Fred Brown who was around to ask about a visa. The man at Cubana says that ho knows nothing of the matter.

Armona calls Fred Brown at the Hotel Agnes. He is paged in the restaurant. Armona and someone else will drop by the hotel for Brown at 1645. Brown speaks very little Spanish.

B. Material Processed

In November, the LIENVOY LP provided the Station with 131 pages of daily resumes from all lines, 78 pages from the Cuban lines, 47 pages from the Czech lines and 110 pages from the Soviet lines. In addition, all of the Soviet and Czech tapes were turned over for the translations of the Russian and Czech conversations. Thirty pieces of miscellaneous material were also received.

C. Liaison

In addition to the PB Band reports passed to LITENSOR, the Station also passed situation reports to him on the India-Red Chinese border war. LITENSOR requested the Station to check a report which LITENSOR had received that 22 boxcars of ammunition was being shipped into Mexico from the United States. (Sce MEXI 2688)

On 5 November 1962 Chief of Station met with LITENSOR at the request of Ambassador MANN. LITENSOR had LITEMPO/2 sit in on the meeting. Ambassador MANN prepared a memorandum based upon a Department of State cable which The Ambassador asked Chief of Station to read to (but not to leave with) LITENSOR, When Chief of Station told LITENSOR that he was to read the telegram (which concerned GPIDEAL's statements and position on Cuba) to him, LITENSOR asked if he could dictate what Chief of Station read to him into his (new) dictaphone. This he did, Both LITENSOR and LITEMPO/2 were pleased with the strong, definite and concise position of GPIDEAL, They were also grateful that Ambassador MANN had got permission to give them this report.

D. Exploitation of Material

Samples of information obtained during the month shed some light on the private life of Carlos Lechuga, Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations, (see MEXI 2701) and the involvement of Braulio Maldonado Sandez in the up-risings in the State of Guerrero, (See MEXI 2713)

## C. Exploitation of Material

The following are examples of LIENVOY coverage:

2.  A "Gabino Fernandez", an employee of the Secretariat of the Presidency, made an appointment with Ramon Sinobas, First Secretary of the Cuban Embassy, because Fernandez wanted to speak to Sinobas before Fernandez went to Cuba for a visit. (See MEXI 1967, 18 September 1962).

## D. Liaison

Briefing papers which were pouched by Headquarters according to DIR 31814 were provided to LITENSOR, LITENSOR requested a further situation report on his forthcoming trip to the Far East. He was ready to call off his trip if KUBARK felt that the world situation was gloomy. (See MEXI 1919, 11 September 1962).

INFO: Chief, SR Division: Chief, KUDESK

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: Operational/Soviet LIENVOY Product

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES: Action: See paragraph 4 below

1.  Transmitted herewith, for purposes of Headquarters familiarization, is a typical one day LIENVOY product of the Soviet lines. (Note that the Station has additional LIFEAT coverage on the personal lines of Colonel Aleksandr coriyevich SIDOROV and Svyatoslav Fedorovich KUENSTSOV, and on the office line of Vladimir Ivanovich SAMOKHIN).

2.  Except for the weekend period, the Spanish language transcript reaches the Soviet case officer on the day followin; the actual transcription at the most usually two days after the transcription. The Station's Russian language translator transcribes the Russian language portions immediately, and this product reaches the Soviet case officer about an hour or two after receipt of the Spanish reporting. Simultaneously, flimsy copies of the above have been given to the reports officer and to other interested Station officers. The first copy is kept in a Station chrono file, for purposes of permanent record. It is annotated for ZONAR purposes.

3.  The Soviet officer, Lucy A. Dillin Ar, and other efficers, read the product quickly for the immediate purpose of obtaining; exploitable LCIMPROVE or other operational leads, and/or reportable intelligence. After this initial scanning, the product is literally cut up, with each clipping of significant conversation sent to C03 and to various Station officers for their information and/or action. Whenever pertinent, the actual LIENVOY clip is sent to Headquarters, for information or action or a summary of the clip is sent to Headquarters in dispatch form. Each clip is eventually routed to the Station's registry where indexing and filin; is completed.

4.  The Station finds that this Soviet LIENVOY clipping program provides the files on the individual Soviet staffers with a rather goed picture of their activities and personality. (These individual files are of course aumented with information derived from double agent operations, LIEMPTY reporting, Headquarters provided information, ODACID reportin;, newspaper clippings and other miscellaneous reporting). In many cases, however, the backbone of a Station file on a Soviet may derive principally from bits and pieces of LIENVOY product.

Category station files receive the clips pertaining to Soviet commercial activities, propaganda activities, Soviet contacts, etc. Very often, a single clipping may have to be copied to be sent to the files of several individual Soviets and/or to one or more category files.

5. Unfortunately, the Station does not have sufficient personnel available to analyze and collate periodically the LIENVOY and other Station product in the individual Soviet files for transmittal to Headquarters for its information; or possibly more important, for eventual transmittal to another Station where a Soviet from Mexico City is reassigned. Headquarters attention is directed again to MEXI-9885 of 17 January 1962 and allied correspondence regarding the desirability of having a trained Headquarters TDYer work on these materials at the Station. Headquarters may now wish to reinvestigate the possibility of finding a qualified staffer for this TDY assignment.

> [Figure: A black and white illustration with hand written notes and a cross.]

B. Material Processed

In June, the LIENVOY LP provided the Station with 163 pages of daily resumes, 63 pages of transcript from the Cuban Embassy lines, 48 tapes from the Czech Embassy Lines, and 98 tapes and the transcriptions of the Spanish conversations from the Soviet Embassy lines. In addition, there were 29 other pieces of material from the LP.

C. Exploitation of Material

From the material processed above the following were some examples of pro- and anti-Communist information:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

The Cuban efforts at propaganda in Mexico in which the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico conferred with Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign Minister, and suggested to him that Fidel Castro write a short message to the Mexican people in *Siempre* on its ninth anniversary of publication (see HMMA 19399).

The negative treatment to a Czech commercial representative by Mexican Immigration authorities (see HMMA 19158).

The refusal by the Pan American Institute of Geography and History of the Organization of American States to permit Teresa Proenza Proenza, Third Secretary and Cultural Attache at the Cuban Embassy, to attend the meeting held by it (see HMM 6438).

The embarrassment caused by the immoral behavior of Mexican female delegates to the Cuban 26 July celebration held in Havana in 1961 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the periodical Politica as told to Teresa Proenza Proenza,

## D. Liaison

With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 29 June - 1 July, liaison activities greatly increased. COS visited LITENSOR on 28 June, LITENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit and the safety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the hands of LITENSOR, At this meeting LITENSOR indicated his annoyance with the Cubans. (See MEXI 1253).

LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief of Station a list of persons who were put under surveillance in connection with the GPIDEAL visit. The list also indicated those who were arrested, (See MEXIS 1244 and 1264).

At a meeting held on 28 May 1962, the Chief of Station, LIELEGANT, and LIENVOY/2 met with LIENVOY/1 and obtained his agreement to hire LIENVOY/14 to work under LIENVOY/3 as a technical inspector in Telefonos de Mexico. The purpose in putting LIENVOY/14 in this capacity is to have a man who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who "would see what others might be tapping telephones" in Telefonos de Mexico. Furthermore, LIENVOY/1 agreed to see to it that LIENVOY/14 would have "the range and authority" to do the work.

Putting LIENVOY/14 as a technical inspector within Telefonos, could create problems for the LIFEAT Project. At the same time WILSTED is re-studying the LIFEAT system, improving it, tightening up the security and alerting the base houses to watch for any abnormal activity on present taps. It has been understood by the LIENVOY case officer that this has been done and it will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports.

## E. Security

For a report on security of the LIENVOY site for June 1962, see peragraph 2 E of HMMA-19319 (RYBAT-1897) dated 10 July 1962.

As was stated at the end of that paragraph, any surveillance or security threat of the LIENVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be handled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Station to LITENSOR.

## F. Technical

The floor in the LP was recently covered with a linoleum which has

greatly contributed to keeping the dust out of the recording machines and in excellent working condition. According to Arnold F. AREHART, the LIENVOY technician, the machines are operating at top efficiency.

G. Personnel

The personnel remains the same as reported in the previous report.

H. Production

Production for the month of June was higher than usual. This increase was primarily due to the GPIDEAL visit. There were seventy-four (74) reports from LIENVOY material during June 1962. These are listed in the attachment,

1. As requested in reference, the station has polled all Station Case officers for possible or confirmed cases of surveillance while making operational contacts. The poll indicated five (5) cases of surveillance during recent months. For the sake of clarity and to give Headquarters an exact idea of the circumstances surrounding each incident, this report will treat each case individually with station comments pertinent to each case.

2. The five cases of possible or confirmed surveillance, related in the first person, are as follows:

## A. Lewis, SHOQUIST: 15 May 1962

"Following a meeting with Frants R. HEGARTY at the Hotel Alameda this date I noticed a Mexican standing quite close to us as we were discussing innocuous subjects just before parting. This fellow moved over and joined another Mexican who was standing at the Juarez Avenue entrance to the Alameda Hotel, I called HEGARTY's attention to these two and suggested that he leave, being very careful to do so himself, while I checked these fellows to be absolutely certain they were interested in us, HEGARTY crossed Juarez and took a cab. Neither of the Mexicans showed any interest in his movements or made any type of observable signal. I walked back into the Hotel and spent about five minutes browsing at the magazine shop then left the hotel by the side entrance. As I glanced toward Juarez Avenue and saw one of the same two fellows who had been at the Juarez entrance nudge the other and call his attention to me. These two fellows had moved in order to check both hotel entrances from the same spot. I walked to an arcade directly across from the hotel entrance and pretended to be looking in shop windows. I saw both Mexicans position themselves so as to observe the arcade, I made no attempt to drop surveillance, being interested instead, in determining definitely that I was the target. As I moved out of the arcade, the two above fingered to another pair of Mexicans who followed me as I moved through the Las Americas parking lot to Calle Independencia. For the next hour and one half to two hours I took these boys on a long tour, mostly on foot. I checked them by starting up streets then changing my mind and doubling back, following an erratic pattern as if shopping aimlessly, stopping in bookshops for periods during which they were forced to stand around somewhat obviously outside, etc. Briefly, it can be summarized by saying that there were at least five members of this team definitely on the surveillance, two others I am quite sure were involved, and one other about whom I am not absolutely sure. When, in my mind, there was no doubt whatsoever that I was the target I caught a taxi and headed toward Reforma Avenue, then to Rio Tiber St, and toward Melchor Ocampo Street. As if changing my mind, I had the driver cut over to Sullivan St, to Shirley Courts where I went in and had lunch. During the cab ride I did not spot car surveillance but, shortly after my arrival at Shirley Courts, I saw three new men not previously on the job, whose actions indicated they were on me. I paid my bill, went into the bathroom for a minute then left through the covered garage and out into Villalongin St, in back of Shirley Courts. Once

out of the Courts, I walked rapidly at sight of the exit and checked myself for the next ten minutes later surveillance, I then across the street from the Roble walked up to Retorna, caught a cab, & across the street from the Ruble Theater, walked into the drug store at the Hotel Retorma, then out the front entrance, down to Woolworth's through Woolworth's to the back entrance, up to Pasaje Latinoamericano, into the Pasare where I stopped at a small counter shop to check as I made a purchase, then rezaced my steps to Calle Madrid, on up to Reforma where I turned into the Reforma entrance to Sanborn's, checked for surveillance, then into the Embassy by the entrance from Sanborn's through the perfume section. There is to doubt whatsoever that these men were on me. The surveillance was not sophisticated from the standpoint of keeping me unaware, but was a very persistent one with these men not getting lost on the simpler tricks, Regardless of who is controlling these fellows, I have cancelled all operational contacts for today and will contact HEGARTY, Oliver Q. WIMPHEN and Simon D, CLACKETT tonight or early tomorrow morning to set up eurtrely now contai arrangements with each, I plan to make my contacts either early in the mornings or later at night in areas where surveillance can be spotted easily. I will instruct all agents to be unusually careful in checking before making any meetings, either with other agents or with me and that if there is any suspicion of surveillance skip the contact and check later at the alternate contact point in each case, if clear by the time of the alternate meeting. I called HEGARTY from a pay phone last night and set up an early morning contact with him to check on whether or act he was fol- lowed when he left the Hotel Alameda yesterday, HEGARTY said that he checked carefully but that there was no indication of interest in him, This is quite a relief since it now appears that I must have been picked up at the Embassy and that I, not HEGARTY, was the target, I cautioned HEGARTY to be even more careful than ever in his approaches to the LINLUCK safehouse and told him that, in our contacts, I was setting up entirely new contact arrange- amants Immediately and that we would not use previous points uptown again, HEGARTY was told that we would use previously agreed upon points in the Polanco-Lomas area, that each point and time for the next meeting would be agreed upon at the previous one to avoid phone use as much as possible, and that most of our meetings would be held before 0900 hours or, when that not feasible, after dark, I suggested that he also inform LINLUCK that I had been under surveillance of some parsistence and that he (LINLUCK) should be even more careful than ever in his contacts with HEGARTY, and in his approaches to the safehouse, I met WIMPHEN and CLACKETT later thar same morning and made similar new contact arrangements with them and advised them of the even greater need for caution. I also advised them to park at least two to three blocks from points of contact and walk in, checking care- fully before and after parking to be sure they are not surveilled and, if there is any suspicion of surveillance, do not make contact but make the alternate later if clear by them,"

B. Algernon O. FORTUNE. 1 November 1961

The above-mentioned noted on the night of in November 1961 at approximately 2100 hours what seemed to be a suspicious situation in attempting to service the LINLUCK safehouse. As indicated on the attached diagram, the subject parked his automobile two blocks away as indicated on the diagram and approached the target by way of Panuco Street. In the approach runthe subject noted a blue Fiat parked at the corner of Lerma and Hudson Streets with two male occupants. As the undersigned, on foot, approached the corner of Panuco and Hudson he noticed another Fiat parked at the very corner with three occupants. Remembering the other Fiat at the end of the block, which was quite visible from the corner of Panuco and Hudson, the undersigned decided to delay entry into the safehouse and casually walk down the block. The undersigned cut across Hudson Street to avoid walking close to the parked car and as he walked on Lerma, noticed the presence of a slow moving car behind him. This did not arouse too much suspicion since this area apparently specializes in street walkers and the local "tenorios" cruise the streets looking for them. As the undersigned reached the parked Q.P. car at the corner of Lerma and Duero the slow moving auto came abreast of the car and the driver almost stopped and stared at the undersigned as he attempted to unlock the car to depart the area. By this time the undersigned got suspicious and attempted to read the license plate, but the plate illumination bulb was out on the suspicious vehicle. The undersigned got in his own car, started down Lerma, passed the suspicious car which immediately fell in behind the undersigned. Not convinced yet of the intent of the following car, the undersigned drove toward Mississippi and made like he was continuing down on Lerma. At the last moment the undersigned swerved into Mississippi, narrowly missing getting clobbered by a vehicle coming down Mississippi. The suspicious vehicle, who was right behind, had to gun his auto to get out of the way so that he had to go straight across Lerma. The undersigned noted as he made the sudden turn into Mississippi that the other vehicle braked as soon as he passed Mississippi and, it seemed to the under- signed, was backing up toward Mississippi. At this point the undersigned poured the coal into the old Green Hornet and left the area. The undersigned then went to the Polanco Bowling Alley instead of home, bowled for approximately an hour and then returned at 2300 hours to inspect the area of action once more. The area was completely free of any parked autos. The undersigned cruised around the area for approximately 35 minutes but could not spot either one of the two Fiats.

Conclusions: (a) As previously stated, there may have been nothing to this incident, and perhaps the autos in question were merely the joy cars looking for customers, but at any rate the set-up looked suspicious therefore the undersigned did not service the safehouse in question.

(b) Douglas NISLEY reported to the undersigned that his records that a suspected Polish intelligence agent, Josef DEJ, resided at Hudson 11, two doors down from the LINLUCK safehouse. It is possible that the surveillance may have been on DEJ and that the under- signed blundered into an unpleasant situation.

(c) LINLUCK reported on 14 November 1961 that it was possible that he was under surveillance and it is possible that he was followed to the safehouse.

# CONFIRMATION OF DISPATCH

EMMA-19319
ZYRAT AY7

Francis R. HEGARTY, the regular case officer handling LINLUCK made the following comments pertinent to FORTYUNE's report of possible surveillance:

> "On 22 November, HEGARTY visited safehouse at Rio Hudson to remove the typewriter and paper and inform the maid in charge that he intended to leave the apartment on the following day and also to arrange for the payment of the light bill which was due. After arranging these matters, HEGARTY left the safehouse and purposely took a circuitous route to his car, which had been parked more than a block away on another street. HEGARTY turned two corners and crossed two streets and detected an individual, Mexican in appearance, approximately six feet tall, 170 lbs., brown hair, ruddy complexion, wearing a tan suit and open sport shirt, and carrying a manila folder in his left hand, walking about 30 feet behind him. HEGARTY walked past his car and turned a third corner and walked rapidly to the middle of the block and then turned in his tracks. When HEGARTY reached the last corner he had turned he almost ran into the individual described above. The man opened his eyes wide, hesitated in mid-stride, but then kept on walking in the direction he had been going. HEGARTY walked to his car and after making sure that the individual did not turn back, immediately left the area." HEGARTY is certain that the safehouse at Rio Hudson was not under surveillance up until 10 November, the last time he visited it previously, and that the surveillance is on the house and not on himself.

Station Comment: See 2 a (Conclusions) above. In a later check of this area by HEGARTY, he could detect no surveillance either stationary or moving. SHOQUIST, however, instructed him to get a new safehouse for LINLUCK meetings immediately following his 22 November report and for neither he nor LINLUCK to go near the Rio Hudson safehouse again.

C. Andrew F. MERTON, 1 June 1962

> "On 1 June 1962, while leaving a meeting with LITAU-1, I detected what could have been a possible surveillance. The meeting was in the Cafe Blanca on Juarez Avenue, between Lafragua Street and the Cabillito Monument. Upon leaving the meeting, to which I had arrived 'clear' to the best of my knowledge, I noted a peculiar flash of expression in the face of a tall, young, dark-haired man apparently waiting in the doorway for something. I had left the meeting first, leaving LITAU-1 to pay the check. Upon noting the expression I had a hunch that something funny might be going on. I turned right out of the door of the cafe and walked the short distance to the corner of Juarez and Reforma, doubling around the corner to the right. This left me on the north side of Reforma headed west in which direction I walked about a block. Two good-looking girls passed me headed south, and observing a good old Latin custom, I suddenly swiveled my head to watch them from the rear. I noted that my tall, dark-haired young man was behind me. As he noted that I could see him be suddenly turned right into a store which sells roof water tanks."

a fairly obvious maneuver, as if trying towards
the Embassy but at a very slow pace. It showed interest in the show
windows. A few minutes later, the "friend" started me briskly walking towards
Reforma and la Fraga, which latter street he crossed, eventually turning
left and crossing the Reforma itself! I did a little counter-surveillance
and appeared somewhere down Avenida M Morelos. My "surveillant" was about
30 years old. dark tan skin, youth-
ful looking, well-dressed in a dark suit and slightly nervous in his actions.
While the whole matter could be legitimate business, his action in ducking into the
store, not just turning in as if engaged in legitimate business, made me
suspect him all the more. If he were really a surveillant, he must have
been on LITAU-1 rather than myself, since the Station had been alerted as
to possible surveillance and I was checking myself".

D. Jeremy L. NIARCOS

Jeremy L. NIARCOS reported sometime in May, 1962 that he had
spotted what definitely seemed like a one-man surveillance on him. Since
he is presently on home leave the submission of a detailed report on the
incident will be deferred until his return to duty.

E. Arnold P. AREHART/LIENVOY

"On Friday 15 June 1962, at approximately 0930, the concierge
noticed two men standing on the corner of Tonala and Chihuahua, who
seemed to have an unusual interest in the activity of the L.P. They
were standing directly across the street from the L.P. One of the
men was tall and thin with a mustache, well dressed and appeared to
be about 30 or 35 years of age. The other was a short fat man and
wore a white shirt coat of the Veracruz type and appeared to be around
50 years of age. They stood on the corner of Tonala and Chihuahua for about
an hour and showed a great deal of interest in the activity of our building.
Around 1030 hours the tall men left and later returned in a 1953 Fiat
model 1900, with a brown body and a beige top with District Plates number
21-73-26. Both of these men then proceeded to observe our installation
from the car, and from time to time appeared to be making notes on the comings
and goings of the installation, as well as making notes on the cars used by
the personnel of the L.P. At about 1145 hours AREHART left the L.P. to
make a phone call and to see if any attempt would be made to follow any one
leaving the building. No attempts were made to follow AREHART, however, his
actions were observed from the car through the rear view mirror. Upon
AREHART's return to the building it was noticed that the men appeared to
be making notes in a small notebook. Finally, around 1330 the tall man
drove off in the car and the fat one took up a new position, about 50 to
100 feet down the block on Chihuahua where he could observe the front door
of the LP. Around 1500 when the first shift was leaving, LIENVOY 16 left
to go to lunch and was followed down Chihuahua. On spotting the surveillance
he returned to the office. Just as he returned to the office LIENVOY 2
returned to the office and was told of the incident. LIENVOY 2 and LIENVOY16
immediately approached the fat man (who had also returned to his former
position), and asked him to explain his action of the day. They also
asked him to identify himself. He showed them a driver's license with
the name MARIANO VERA GONZALES. This information was checked at the
Department of Traffic and found to be the license of another person. At
this time it was decided to establish a stake out at the Traffic Department
in order to discover and identify anyone who might show an interest in the
names and addresses of the cars used by our installation. On the 16th of
June, Unit "C" (Victor) informed LIENVOY 2 that around 1300 hours an old
friend of his, Guillermo MUNOZ SAMANO, an agent of the Secret
Service of the Police Headquarters, showed up and said that he was looking
for a Mister IROU in order to obtain some information about the owner of
a car with District Plates 723 (LIBYA -2). Victor suggested that they
check the files for the information, however, the information was not
available. During their conversation Guillermo MUNOZ stated that he
worked as a supervisor of the medical services of the Central Department
and showed Victor his credentials signed by Dr. Julian GARZA TREVINA.
He also said that he had another job at the Health Department.
While they were talking, another agent passed by and asked MUNOZ to give him his

was ill. (See MEXI 0822. 17 May 1962).

D. Liaison

During the period under review the Chief of Station maintained regular contact with LIELEGANT and other individuals connected with the Project.

E. Security

There were no evident security problems for the month of May.

F. Technical

As usual, the equipment in the LP was checked and cleaned. However, during the month several of the lines were out of order. The Cuban Embassy was apparently still working on its telephonic system within the building. Other lines which were out of order were probably due to the inherent problems of the telephone company.

G. Personnel

There was no change in the personnel for the month and it kept the same schedule of work as reported for April.

H. Production

During May, LIENVOY produced the forty-five (45) positive intelligence reports indicated in the attachment and the usual volume of CI/CE personality and operational material.

INFO Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT LIENVOY Tarpets

ACTION REQUIRED For your information

REFERENCE(S) HMM-W-10,620

1. An error was made by the person preparing HMM-A-18,752
   (RYBAT-1833) or by the typist who chose the DFS list of taps
   (in HMM-A-18,246) instead of the correct IJENVOY list of targets.

2. The only explanation available is that with a change of
   Case Officers (Malcolm Q. EDELAND departed to become COS, Tegucigalpa),
   and with the delay in writing monthly reports on LIENVOY and lack of
   familiarity with the operation, the error was made--either by the
   drafting officer or by the typist.

3. This error will not occur again.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Task Force Washington

ATTENTION : John Caswell

SUBJECT : Feasibility of Effecting Release of Manuel URRUTIA,
Ex-President of Cuba, Political Exile in Mexican
Embassy, Havana

1. The Mexico City Station has the capability of approaching LITENSOR (Iden A) and requesting him to attempt to arrange for a safe conduct pass for Subject. The approach to LITENSOR can be made through three different channels; LITSE10/2, (Iden B), LILEGAT (Iden C), and LIEXCO (Iden D). Also, a direct approach by the COS to LITENSOR could probably be arranged if so desired by Headquarters for operational security reasons.

2. No assessment on the success of an approach of this type can be made because of the Mexican interest and position re Cuba.

3. If a decision is made to attempt to obtain a safe conduct pass for Subject, it is recommended that the COS Mexico City be informed in detail of Headquarters minimum and maximum goals and that he be requested to recommend the best channel to LIFESOR.

DISPATCH SYMBOL AND NO.: HMMA-18571 RYBAT A1813

SUBJECT: Examples of Marxist Textbooks used in Mexican Schools

DATE: 9 February 1962

ACTION REQUESTED: PRIORITY: See paragraph 3 below.

REFERENCES:

1. Attached are copies of:

a. "Broviario de Cultura Economica" (Segunda Edicion-1960) written by (Marxist) Francisco FARRERA Valdes and, as can be seen on the inner first page, Approved by the Textbook Commission of the Ministry of Education as the textbook in beginning economics courses in Mexican public schools.

Note: i. This book is pure Marxism. Pages 19, 41, 44 and many others distinctly praise Marxism and condemn capitalism and capitalist countries (particularly England, the U.S.A. and France).

ii. Also attached is a copy of the work notebook for this text.

iii. This book and its Marxist contents has been called to the attention of LITENSOR, LIERGO and others by COS. To date, however, the approval of this textbook has not been withdrawn.

b. "Cuba, Despertar de America", written by (Marxist) Ramon RAMIREZ Gomes, who is one of the most important professors of economics in the School of Economics at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (U.N.A.M.). This book, which is pure Marxist, praises Castro's Cuba, Communist China and Marxism and condemns the U.S.A. This book was published officially by the National University of Mexico in 1961 and is used in the School of Economics there.

Note: Ramon RAMIREZ Gomes was one of the professors primarily responsible for expelling Luis Felipe COELLO Matins and Guillermo VELEZ Pelayo from the U.N.A.M. because they took part in anti-Castro, and-Communist activities on 26 July 1961 (see HMMA-17925 and HMMA-18407).

2. Another textbook which is Marxist and which has been the subject of considerable publicity recently is "La Unidad de Trabajo y Estudio" by Clara D. CARDOUNEL, Professor at the Escuela Normal de Matanzas, Cuba, 1958. This book was one of the issues that provoked a mass demonstration against the leftist policies of Governor Eduardo LIVAS Villareal of Nueva Leon. (See MEXI-9842 and MEXI-0033.)

3. It will be recalled that on the evening of 11 January 1962 Thomas A. BRASST requested copies of the two (2) textbooks listed in paragraph 1. above. from COS. He wished to consider using them in a presentation to certain Senators and Congressmen.

SUBJECT: Cuban Embassy Activities

REF: 03-KEIK-ONE

ACTION REQUIRED: For information

RESTRICTIONS: NO FOREIGN DISSEM
INDCONO CAN BE ARGED BY QUALIFIED HQ DESK ONLY

MEXI-9961, Para. 3

1. Attached is a copy of a long conversation obtained by LIKRODE on 18 January 1962.

2. The conversation is amongst: Jose Antonio PORTUONDO Valdor, Cuban Ambassador; Berta PORTUONDO (his wife); Xiomara SANCHEZ Robert (PORTUONDO's secretary) and a Mexican visitor. The visitor pretends to be a student from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN). The two women -- and later PORTUONDO -- accuse the Mexican of being a provocateur; and PORTUONDO lectures him on the Cuban Embassy's policy of non-intervention in Mexico.

3. On 23 January 1962 LITALUS/2 reported the visit by one MOTA (now-five months), agent of the Direccion Federal de Seguridad (DFS). LITALUS/2 showed the case officer a copy of MOTA's report on his visit to the Cuban Embassy and his conversation there. (The DFS, according to LITALUS/2, do not believe the report!)

4. A copy of the portion of the tape with this (MOTA) conversation was played for LITEMPO/2. He found it extremely interesting and said the Cuban Ambassador "protested his innocence too much".

5. If Headquarters approves (as requested in reference) a copy of the attached will be given to LITEMPO/2 for him to "make public" as material collected by him. This and the additional materials specified in reference would, it is hoped, have sufficient impact to cause the Mexicans to break relations with Cuba.

No tape exists for this; and LITEMPO/2 will be told it has been erased if he requests it.

The following message has been received from Mexico City:

For King and Sayre from Ambassador Manns

1.  As you know, some weeks ago we became convinced that only chance of getting Mexico to break relations with Cuba would be on basis Cuban intervention Mexican internal affairs. This of course was on assumption two thirds Rio treaty vote could not be obtained at Punta Del Esto.

2.  With this objective in mind Dept and CAS authorized me to turn over materials described in IN 12519 to appropriate Mexican official. I chose Gustavo DIAZ Ordas.

3.  DIAZ Ordas has informed CAS that he discussed this evidence with Lopas Hatens who expressed surprise and interest. We discount Lopez Kateos statements because as you know he has much better evidence of Cuban Embassy intervention which he keeps strictly to himself and has never told Cabinet about. The evidence we turned over to DIAS Ordas has psychological importance because President is now aware that DIAL Ordaz also knows part of the story. He can hovor be sure that DiAd Onias will not use this to support his own anti-communist convictions if a showdown between the Corries and anti-Commies should occur in Mexico.

4.  DIAZ Ordas has asked me through CAS whether I would have any objection if the information wa furnished him were made public should an appropriate occasion arise in the future. he said there would be no mention of the U.. Govt and that Cobermacion would present the evidence as collected by it.

5.  I recommend that CAS and fent authorize me to inform DIAZ Ordas that we have no objection on the basis outlined by him. Reason for my recommend- ation is that on the one hand we lose little by blowing the microphone oneration since battery 18 scheduled to expira soon in any case. We believe we are in a position where we can safely deny that we had anything to do with placing micro- phone. In this connection DIAL Ordas obviously believes our story that wo picked up signal by routing dialing of different frequencica and that microphone was presumably placed by Soviets to check on their satellites. On other hand affirmative answer to DIAZ Ordas will also implicitly suggest the possibility that the time way come when we ourselves might wish to make this information

public. I can think of no better incentive to Lopes Mateos to break relations with Cuba than possibility Mexican public might eventually become aware of extent to which Mexico has tolerated Cuban intervention in spite of its vaunted devotion to the doctrine of non-intervention.

6. Finally I wish to say that I realise all of these maneuvers involve some risk to U.S. but I believe resurgence of Communist influence in last two months requires unusual counteraction on our part.

7. DIAZ Ordas has returned material to CAS for safe keeping and it is now in our possession. He claims he made no copies and we believe this probably true.

FOR GALBOND AND SAYRE FROM AMBASSADOR MANN: [^1]

1.  AS YOU KNOW, SOME WEEKS AGO WE BECAME CONVINCED THAT ONLY
    CHANCE OF GETTING MEXICO TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH CUBA WOULD BE ON
    BASIS CUBAN INTERVENTION MEXICAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THIS OF COURSE
    WAS ON ASSUMPTION TWO THIRDS RIO TREATY VOTE COULD NOT BE OBTAINED
    AT PUNTA DEL ESTE.

2.  WITH THIS OBJECTIVE IN MIND DEPT AND CAS AUTHORIZED ME TO
    TURN OVER MATERIALS DESCRIBED IN MEXI 9855 TO APPROPRIATE MEXICAN
    OFFICIAL. I CHOSE GUSTAVO DIAZ ORDAZ.

3.  DIAZ ORDAZ HAS INFORMED CAS THAT HE DISCUSSED THIS EVIDENCE
    WITH LOPEZ MATEOS WHO EXPRESSED SURPRISE AND INTEREST. WE DIS-
    COUNT LOPEZ MATEOS STATEMENTS BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW HE HAS MUCH
    BETTER EVIDENCE OF CUBAN EMBASSY INTERVENTION WHICH HE KEEPS
    STRICTLY TO HIMSELF AND HAS NEVER TOLD CABINET ABOUT. THE
    EVIDENCE WE TURNED OVER TO DIAZ ORDAZ HAS PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE

    OF THE STORY. HE CAN NEVER BE SURE THAT DIAZ ORDAZ WILL NOT USE

4. DIAZ ORDAZ HAS ASKED ME THROUGH CAS WHETHER I WOULD HAVE ANY
   OBJECTION IF THE INFORMATION WE FURNISHED HIM WERE MADE PUBLIC
   SHOULD AN APPROPRIATE OCCASION ARISE IN THE FUTURE. HE SAID THERE
   WOULD BE NO MENTION OF THE U.S. GOVT AND THAT GOBERNACION WOULD
   PRESENT THE EVIDENCE AS COLLECTED BY IT.

5. I RECOMMEND THAT CAS AND DEPT AUTHORIZE ME TO INFORM DIAZ
   ORDAZ THAT WE HAVE NO OBJECTION ON THE BASIS OUTLINED BY HIM.
   REASON FOR MY RECONNENDATION IS THAT ON THE ONE HAND WE LOSE LITTLE
   BY BLOWING THE MICROPHONE OPERATION SINCE BATTERY IS SCHEDULED
   TO EXPIRE SOON IN ANY CASE. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE
   WE CAN SAFELY DENY THAT WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLACING MICRO-
   PHONE. IN THIS CONNECTION DIAZ ORDAZ OBVIOUSLY BELIEVES OUR STORY
   THAT WE PICKED UP SIGNAL BY ROUTINE DIALING OF DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES
   AND THAT MICROPHONE WAS PRESUMABLY PLACED BY SOVIETS TO CHECK
   ON THEIR SATELLITES. ON OTHER HAND AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO DIAZ ORDAZ
   WILL ALSO IMPLICITLY SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIME MAY COME
   WIIEN WE OURSELVES MIGHT WISH TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC.
   I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER INCENTIVE TO LOPEZ MATEOS TO BREAK RELATIONS
   WITII CUDA THAN POSSIBILITY MEXICAN PUBLIC MIGHT EVENTUALLY DECOME
   AWARE OF EXTENT TO WHICH MEXICO HAS TOLERATED CUBAN INTERVENTION
   IN SPITE OF ITS VAUNTED DEVOTION TO THE DOCTRINE OF NON-INTERVENTION.

6. FINALLY I WISH TO SAY THAT I REALIZE ALL OF THESE MANEUVERS
   INVOLVE SOME RISK TO U.S. BUT I BELIEVE RESURGENCE OF COMMUNIST
   INFLUENCE IN LAST TWO MONTHS REQUIRES UNUSUAL COUNTERACTION ON

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: Operations Proposed by Station Mexico City to Influence Mexico to Break Relations with Cuba.

1. In addition to the proposal advanced by Ambassador Mann to pass certain telephone tap transcripts to high Mexican officials, Station Mexico City has just forwarded the following suggested operations designed to influence the Mexican Government to break relations with Cuba prior to the OAS Conference:

A. To prepare the Mexican "version" of the paper on Cuban Subversive Activities for the Ambassador to pass to Foreign Minister.

B. To fabricate on tape a phoney conversation by the Cuban Ambassador and insert it into the joint telephone tapping operation we operate for the President.

C. To attempt to persuade a longtime Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy to defect and make a public statement condemning Cubans for interference in Mexican affairs.

D. Should it not be possible to have the Subject above make a public defection, attempt through him to obtain incriminating documents or propaganda from the Cuban Embassy that are suitable for sensational exploitation. The Subject has claimed that the Cubans are running "indoctrination" classes for Mexican youth within the Embassy building.

E. If security considerations permit, attempt to arrange a "crash" of the automobile of the Cuban diplomat Hecelio RODRIGUEZ. The "crash" would involve a special under-car device containing weapons and propaganda examples to "prove" Cuban intervention in local labor problems.

2. In view of the highly sensitive nature of the operations proposed above and their timing (prior to 22 January) as related to the forthcoming OAS conference and the announced visit of President Kennedy to Mexico, it

Is suggested that thees oporations be discussed with the Departsent o Etats in detail. This ray be an inopportuno time for such cekivities, since the Mexican Government is likely to scrutinize with special car all events, whether bonfide or contrived, in the intervening paried baforo 72 January.

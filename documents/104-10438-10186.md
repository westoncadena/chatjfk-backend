MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Call from Jon French of DCD Concerning Frank STURGIS

1. The following information was provided to Jon French by his DCD Miami office on 23 August. The information was given to the DCD Miami office by a contact (not identified) on 23 August who obtained it from Oscar FREELY. FREELY is writing a book on Frank STURGIS.

2. STURGIS is to appear on the Tomorrow Show at 2 a.m. on 24 August, which is to be narrated by Tom Schneider. STURGIS just recently returned to Miami from taping the show in New York.

3. While in New York STURGIS saw Marita LORENZ and obtained from her a book which, according to source, appeared to be cryptographic material and seemed to relate to Albania. The DCD source saw a "few copies" of what he described as "mathematical matrix" material.

4. STURGIS currently (today - 23 August) is attempting to contact Senator Baker to turn over the material to him. DCD plans to ask the source to monitor the situation and advise whether the material in fact is turned over to Baker.

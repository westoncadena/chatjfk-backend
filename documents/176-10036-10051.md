1. IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION/24 JULY 63, SALVADOR ROMANI, REPRESENTATIVE IN VENEZUELA OF CUBAN EXILE ORGANIZATION COMANDO UNIFICADO DE LA LIBERACION EN CUBA (UNITED COMMAND OF CUBAN LIBERATION - CULC), CLAIMED THAT A SMALL NUMBER CUBAN EXILES HAD ALREADY MOVED FROM MIAMI TO NICARAGUA.

OTHER EXILE GROUPS WILL AWAIT REACTION OF UNITED STATES BEFORE
DECIDING THEIR OWN COURSE OF ACTION.

2. NUCLEUS/SUCH A BASE WOULD BE DRAWN FROM THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND
   EXILES WHO, ACCORDING TO ROMANI, HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED MILATARY
   TRAINING FROM MEMBERS/U.S. ARMED FORCES. ROMANI CLAIMED U.S.
   POLICY IS TO FERMENT INTERNAL RESISTANCE IN CUBA AND/STRENGTHEN THE
   RESISTANCE BY INFILTRATION OF TRAINED COMMANDO GROUPS OF EXILES.
   FOR THIS REASON THE U.S. CONTINUES/GIVE TACIT SUPPORT FOR TRAINING
   OF EXILE MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.

3. ROMANI MADE FOLLOWING REVIEW OF POLICIES OF PRINCIPAL EXILE
   PARTIES:

(A) CULC IS CONCENTRATING ON DISSEMINATION/ANTI-CASTRO
PROPAGANDA IN CUBA TO PREPARE GROUND FOR INSURRECTION. IT FAVORS
INFILTRATION/SMALL MILITARY GROUPS BUT REJECTS A GENERAL INVASION.

(B) JURE (JUNTA REVOLUCIONARIA), LED BY MANUEL RAY, CONSIDERS THE
PRINCIPLE REQUIREMENT IS TO SECURE SUPPORT OF DISCONTENTED ELEMENTS
IN CUBAN MILITIA AND ARMED FORCES.

(C) ALLIANCE OF MRP (MOVIMIENTO REVOLUCIONARIO POPULAR),
SECOND FRONT OF ESCAMBRAY AND ALPHA 66, SUPPORTS CONTINUATION OF HIT-
AND-RUN RAIDS ON CUBAN MAINLAND IN ORDER/MAINTAIN MORALE OF RESISTANCE
FORCES IN CUBA.

(E) FUR (FRENTE UNIDO REVOLUCIONARIO), LED BY AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO, IS WORKING PRIMARILY TO OBTAIN AGREEMENT/LATIN AMERICAN GOVTS FOR COORDINATED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON CUBA

SUBJECT: WIROGUE

DATE: 30 September 1964

TIME: 1030 - 1400 hours

PLACE: Automobile in the Vicinity of Kuhwaldstr.
ARTHUR A. LIFALL, Case Officer

COMMENTS:

WIROGUE called at approximately 0945 hours on the Stage I
Ops phone and asked for Mr. Murmann. C.O. took the call and was
advised that the caller was "Dave" and that he desired to speak
to a colleague of Mr. Murmann at the earliest possible time.
C.O. made arrangements to meet him in front of the safe house
at 51 Kuhwaldstr which WIROGUE occupied during his 1 1/2 year
association with HARVARD (this is no longer a HARVARD safe house).
C.O. did not tell Dave"his name over the telephone and indicated
that he would be able to recognize "Dave". C.O. picked "Dave"
up on the corner of Volta and Kuhwaldstr and drove a couple of
blocks to a parking place where the conversation took place.

C.O. learned that WIROGUE was no longer employed by the
Bochler Company in Munich. He apparently has had a couple of
factory jobs since that job and is currently unemployed.
According to "Dave" he is without work, without friends, without
money and" only contacted Murmann's old office because he is
"at the end of his rope". Subject stated that he had tried hard
to find suitable employment in Germany, but that there was
absolutely nothing available which he could do. It was obvious
that WIROGUE wished to renew his association with the AIS and that
"intelligence work" was the only kind of employment for which he
felt himself really qualified. When C.O. indicated to him that the
employment possibilities had not changed since WIROGUE was told
there was no possibility of future employment with the Agency,
Subject said that the purpose of his telephone call was to advise
us of his plans to go to Paris and attemin to contact the...
French Intelligence-Service to which he would-offer-his_services.
He wished to find out if we would have any objections to his
seeking employment from the French or possibly the British since
we are apparently unable to utilize him further. C.O. said that
obviously WIROGUE would do what he would do and that while we
had no control over his actions it would seem a bit surprising
that he would delibertely place himself in the hands of the
French authorities where he was known to have a criminal record.
WIROGUE implied that he would obviously tell all to the French
and indicated that he was not concerned about any actions that
they would take against him. He appeared sure in an extremely
vague and confused way that the French Intelligence Service could
use him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 4

In the course of the lengthy discussions WIROGUE let it be known that he was not very happy about the treatment he had received from the Americans--that he felt he had been dropped, and it appeared obvious to C.O. that if we had no further work for him he was threating to tell his story to the French authorities--a story which he presumably feels we would not like the French to know about. It should be stressed that at no time was the "blackmail threat" bluntly presented. It was merely that he wished to advise us of his plan to leave for Paris this date with this intention in mind and that he wished to determine if we had any "objections".

С.О. xafasad reviewed with WIROGUE the considerable efforts which had been made to assist him in establishing a new life here In the FEDREP-- a new life story, legal documentation, the hapaxta taak opportunity to look for employment for a period of more than a year while receiving subsistence from us, etc. C.O. told Subject that he obviously had a good mind and was in good health and that--if he was unable to find some type of employment in the thriving West German economy that appealed to him there and satisfied him--he would probably be unhappy wherever he goes. C.O. discounted Subject's beliefs that "intelligence work" was the only thing for which he was suited. C.O. sap expressed the view that he should get his head out of the clouds and his feet on the ground--that he should find a job, however entrar, and throw himself into it. At this point WIROGUE said that at one time he had told Mr. Murmann of his desire to become a driver or chauffer but that Mr. Murmann told him he could find much more suitable employment. With a certain amount of disbelief C.O. pursued this topic with him telling. WIROGUE that-Bif he wara was really serious thatxha in believing that this kind of employment would be satisfying to him, that it was the first sensible thought he had expressed in the course of the discussions and that C.O. would determine whether it would be possible to assist Subject in obtaining a West German driverss license (Subject indicated that- he had a Congo drivers license when he arrived in Frankfurt although it was issued in another name). While Subject pretended to have a genuine interest in obtaining such employment-- and used this to refute C.O.'s accusation that he only wanted to start at the top and considered most kinds of honest employment as being beneath him--C.O. is highly skeptical of Subject's motives. WIROGUE was told to call Makaxxxxkixx Mac (this is the only name which C.O.gave to WIROGUE) on the following day (Thursday, 1 October) and C.O. would za let him know whether he could help him obtain a West German license.

ORME K. DARONNAT, Case Officer

COMMENTS:

C. O. met Subject who had invited him to meet for lunch. They had a drink together and then went to a Chineese restaurant.

At first C. O. was afraid that Subject was getting ready to ask a favor or present a problem but it turned out that he merely wanted to visit with C.O. whom he considers to be his only friend, at least in Frankfurt. He said that his work with the Munich firm is going very well and is coming along fine. He received his arst month's salary and expects to go to Munich on the first part of May for consultations and would then, around 30 May, move to Munich permanently. C. O. told Subject that he would be leaving for the U.S. probably the first week in June and Subject asked if they could have dinner together at least one more time before he left.

Subject said he had signed the contract, details of which he had previously given C.O., but was sorry that he had not brought the contract with him and promised to show it to C.O. the next time they met. Subject thanked C. O. for all the help he had given him to enable him to make a new start and wanted the lunch to be a small token of his appreciation. He also paid C.O. 20 DM which had been loaned him a year and a half earlier and gave C.O. a small French cigarette lighter as a rememberance. C. O. dropped Subject off downtown and suggested they have lunch, perhaps the first or second week in May.

ORNE K. DARONNAT, Case Officer

COMMENTS:

C. O. met Subject in response to a telephone call in which Subject invited C. O. to lunch to help him celebrate a new stroke of fortune. WIROGUE told C. 0. that the director of the firm in Munich (reported in previous contact reports) and his European sales representative had met with Subject and discussed the possibility of his association with the Munich firm. Subject said the following had been agreed on:

Subject would receive 1500 DM a month salary, free living quarters in Munich, the cost of maintaining his apartment in Frankfurt, expense account, percentage of the profits realized from any of Subject's inventions patented by the firm, a work shop in Munich plus absolute personal freedom of movement regarding working hours, etc. etc.

C. O. told him that the above was very hard to believe, that he should have this in writing. Subject said that it was to be drawn-up and sent to him for his signature.

C. O., of course, expressed his delight with Subject's perspicacity and perspicuity and it but not boundless. C. O. asked if this would mean he would be moving to the Munich area. Subject said that this was doubtful unless he could find a mechanic in the Munich area who would work as cheaply as Nagely with whom he is now associated. He intends to spend most of his time in Munich, however, and will come to Frankfurt once a month to oversee Nagely's work on the production models of his projects. Subject intends to do the research and development work in Munich with Nagely in Frankfurt making the finished model.

SECRET

C. O. told Subject that he should not forget he would be required to establish a Zweiter Wohngits Subject said he would look into this as soon as the work shop in Munich as completed and ready for him.

Subject stated that C. O. was his was his only friend and that he would like to call him again soon and have lunch with him. C. O. told him he would be delighted to meet him whenever he has time. C. O. dropped Subject off off downtown after congratulating him once again on his good fortune

NOTE: C. O. is aware that Subject is basically a lonely man and does enjoy his company. He his company. He is also aware rethat Subject is staying in frequent touch because he feels he is operating in a society to which he really does not belong and associates himself more with things American.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: WIROGUE

On 25 February 1964 the undersigned met with Clarence Schmidt and Art Stimpson of OCA Bonn to apprise them of the status of the WIROGUE case. Since Clarence S. was preparing to depart PCS, C.O.'s discussion was primarily with Art S., Clarence's replacement.

C. O. briefed Art on WIROGUE's background prior to recruitment and his activities while associated with KUBARK. C. O. reviewed HARVARD's attempt to prepare Subject for resettlement and said that we are now in a position to quit claim him and close the case and that we wanted to bring OCA up-to-date on the status of Subject's case and to find out if there are any loose ends from Bonn's point of view or HARVARD'S which should be tightened up prior to cutting Subject loose.

C. O. explained that since December 12, 1962 when OCA received a query from the BFV regarding Subject, HARVARD had been trying to reach the point where Subject could be on his own. C. O. explained that we had realized that after the original political recognition interview fiasco had brought Subject to the attention of the BFV., that to enable Subject to emigrate from Germany or to stay here without continuing problems in the future would require preparing a complete life history for Subject with a new political recognition interview story. Both the Lebenslauf and a new interview story were prepared and copies of the old story were removed from the various files and replaced by the new. C. O. said that HARVARD had two questions for Bonn end that (1) at the time of the original BFV interest in Subject had OCA promised Subject would be resettled outside Germany? and (2) would OCA know if the BFV in Cologne had a copy of Subject's political recognition interview story?. Art brought out OCA's file on the case and said to answer the second question first it would appear from the detailed information contained in the BFV query that they


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

were indeed in possession of a copy of the story. He went on to state that in answer to question (1) OCA's reply to the BFV was that Subject was of operational interest to AIS and would they please suspend their investigation until Subject is no longer of interest at which time OCA would automatically provide the BFV with the details of Subject's case.

C. O. said that John Wilms of the 513th MI Group at Camp King was reasonably certain that the BFV man in Zirndorf had only sent excerpts of the Sanders political recognition interview story to the BFV in Cologne, since so many cases of interest to the BFV are processed each month that only the bare outlines of a particular case would be sent on from Zirndorf. Art and Al W. said that if the original story had not gone to Cologne then a very detailed summary had gone.

We all agreed that unless Subject got into serious trouble in the future no problems would arise. In any event we could only wait and see what might come up.

OCA appreciated being brought up-to-date on the case and provided HARVARD C. O. with copies of the BFV 's original query and OCA's reply: C. O. promised to send OCA a copy of Subject's original and of his latest political recognition interview story and a copy of the Lebenslauf.

COMMENTS:

C. O. met Subject as a result of a telephone call requesting C. O.'s assistance. Subject told C. O. that he had gone to the local police revier and had tried to register but that since he had neglected to take along a filled-out Anmeldebestätigung signed by the landlord he had been told to go get the form, fill it out properly and then return. The police had looked at his deregistration slip with the 2 March date indicated and had told him to waste no time since an individual is required to deregister and re-register within a period of 8 days and it was now the 10th of March. Subject said that since his rental contract dates from January 1 and that date is indicated on the registration slip, the police will question why he waited so long to register. C. O. told him that the answer was simple and that he wished Subject would not bother him with such small problems. C. O. told Subject to get an Anmelda forn and fill it out and have his landlord sign that he moved into the apartment on 1 March and explain to the landlord that he had been deregistered as of 2 March. Subject said that he had already figured this out but that he wanted an excuse to meet C. 0. and talk to him.

He showed C. O. a Munich Konto check for 4,000 DM which he had received for developing a device reported in previous contact reports and went on to say that his business trip to Munich had been reasonably successful. He had discussed the development of several new devices with the director of the Munich firm and was now in the process of working on another device for the firm. He had made arrangements whereby he would receive no parmont for the new device but that the firm would use its sales to mark another invention of his for him. The firm had also asked Subject if he would be willing to come to Munich to live and work. Subject has agreed if the offer turns out to be worth his while. C. O. congratulated Subject and told him to continue the good work.

COMMENTS:

C. O. met Subject and gave him his new Reiseausweis expiring in 1966 and pointed out there was a restriction against going into business for himself. He was given his Lohnsteurkarten for '62, '63 and 64 plus his Abmeldebestatigung indicating his deregistration from 145 Hohemarkstr to 51 Kuhwaldstr on 2 March 1964. He was told to go to the local Police Revier and register.

Subject was given a copy of his new political recognition interview story and was asked if he had any questions regarding his legend. Subject replied that the story was so long he could not possibly memorize it completely. C. O. told him that the intent was to provide in detail any and all facts which in the future might be of importance to him in the conduct of his affairs.

Subject was asked about his plans for the future. His answer was that the Director of the firm (reported in contact report 17 February 1964) had invited him to come to Munich on 3 March 1964 to discuss, among other things, the possibility of employing Subject in the engineering department. This plus the fact that Subject has signed an agreement with BOHLER & CO. OPTICAL FACTORY, FF/M to act as an engineering consultant might enable him to realize his ambition, i.e. to have a position rather than an ordinary job.

C. O. quitclaimed Subject and wished him luck.

Subject asked that C. O. be sure to let the higher echelon know he appreciates all that_has_been_done-for-him.

Subject said that although official contact is at an end he hoped that C. O. would not reject an invitation for a friendly get together from time to time. C. O. replied that if business matters permitted he would be glad to meet Subject.

Subject jovially announced that they would probably meet some day in the U.S. C. O. reminded him that any action on his part which would involve the taking of fingerprints could have dire consequence for him. C. O. went on to report what he had told Subject months earlier and that is:

![photo of text: Exct i:..]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

Any attempt to immigrate to the U.S., Canada, Australia, etc. would bring him to the attention of INTERPOL On the other hand, he could immigrate to South America but it would be imperative that he first learn Russian if he is to pass himself off as a recent refugee from the Soviet Union. C. O. said he could see no reason to prevent Subject from visiting any country or even entering as a technical representative. C. O. told him that he is soundly, if not perfectly, documented and that we can do no better and that he should never forget that his fingerprints are the weakest links.

C. O. said good-by and parted company. Case closed.

NOTE: Normally HARVARD would provide a statement on one of our cover unit stationary letterheads covering the period of time Subject was in our custody and indicating that he was more or less professionally associated with the U.S. Army. Chief/HARVARD and C. O. felt that unless Subject requests such a letter it would be adviseable not to expose him to any more of our M.O. We can be sure that if Subject needs such a letter he will contact HARVARD.

* This of course is not true but does enable us to exercise some control.

COMMENTS:

C. 0. dropped in to see Subject and paid him DM 800 final subsistence for March. C. O. emphasized that this would be the last time Subject would receive any money and that he must now arrange for a new source of income. Subject laughed and said he had the impression C. O. was anxious to get rid of him and also seemed to have doubts as to his ability to take care of his financial problems. C. O. laughed in turn and said he would indeed be glad to see Subject on his own and added that he had no doubts re: Subject's ability to get money but that he is only hoping Subject would use methods acceptable to society (chuckle).

Since Subject had both English and German versions of his legend, C. 0. took the English copy with the explanation that if Subject should submit a Lebenslauf, in connection with a job application, the German version would be more appropriate.

C. O. took Subject to lunch and dropped him off in the city after promising to see him on the 2nd of March.

C.O. picked up Subject's Reвиаnweis and told him it would be returned to the authorities and a new one would be issued. This would eliminate the need for a renewal until 1966.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: WIROGUE

1. C. O. and Sam Markowtiz met with John Wilms, Special Liaison Advisor to the 513th MI Group at Camp King, to discuss certain problems connected with the WIROGUE case. C.0. told John that we are going to attempt to make a clean brake with Subject this coming Friday but there were a few loose ends which had to be cleared up before we could take this final step. C. O. said that in reviewing the new political recognition interview story, we had noted that the new story did not incorporate the name change of Subject's father from Simon Sanders to Frank Simon Sanders. C. O. asked if the new copy would have to be changed or replaced. John made a note of what the change of nane should really be and told C. O. have all the new copies changed to read Frank Simon Sanders. John said that this sort of thing happens from time to time; that it is just a simple error and will raise no eyebrows.

2. C. O. then brought up the point that Subject's Reiseausweis will expire in October 1964 and we and Subject were wondering if subtext would run into any problem when he went to the Polizei Presidum to get a Reiseausweis rencwal. John said that there would be no problems that he could see: but to make sure that there is no slip-up, we should pick up Subject's current Reiseausveis and if Sam prepares the necessary Antrag, John will get us a new Reiseausweis within one or two days, dated with a current date. C. O. said he would pick up Subject's Reiseausweis and give it to Sam this week and Sam will prepare the necessary papers for a new Reiseausweis, plus a 1964 Lohnsteurkarte and a deregistration slip. If this works out, our plans to with Subject will be accomplished this coming Friday.

3. C. 0. then pointed out the BFV's interest in Subject in late 1962 and mentioned to John we had received a query from Bonn indicating the BFV's interest in Subject, and contained what looked like excerpts from Subject's political recognition

interview story. C. O. went on to say that we were wondering if a copy of the story might have gone to the BFV in Bonn, and that Wilms had missed one of the old copies when he recalled all copies recently and replaced them with the new story. John said that Camp Zirndorf processes 50 to 100 cases a month, one half of which are interest in one way or another to the BFV. He said that what had gone to Bonn was very likely an excerpt, that the entire story would not have been sent to Bonn. John went on to say that with the new copy in the file, if this excerpt should come to light in the future, a check would merely indicate that someone had made a mistake and the matter would be dropped. John added that he knows we are concerned about this case, but that he sees no reason why there should be any trouble of any kind. He said that the only problem will be if Subject himself comes to the attention of the authorities because of some shinanigans on his part.

C. O. met Subject in what is now his apartment and which has been completely painted and wallpapered. C. o. gave Subject a copy of his Lebenslauf in German and a copy in English. He was told to read the story thoroughly and then to call C. O. later in the week when he was ready to discuss any points in the story not clear to him or to resolve any questions which he might have. C. O. said he would bring a Soviet realities expert with him who could answer any questions he might have. Subject gave C. O. his copy of the old political recognition interview story plus receipts which indicated he had paid 300 DM "Caution" and a rent receipt for 300 DM for the month of February. He also showed C.0. his rental contract for the 6 month period starting February 1, 1964. Subject gave C. O. a bill for 410 DM, cost of repairing his lower plate. C. O. gave Subject the money and told him to pay the bill and get the receipt stamped paid and return it to C. O. Subject was told that C. O. would pay him for the month of March, deregister him probably the latter part of the week, and give him the deregistration slip. He was also told C. O. would deliver his new political recognition interview story to him probably this week. Subject was not too pleased to hear that he would be deregistered because his Reiseausweis expires in October 1964 and Subject feels that it might not be renewed unless he is under the protection of the U.S. Army. С. О. said he feels there is no reason to worry unless Subject is not working and, thereby proving that he is not an industrious law-abiding citizen. Subject said that he has been trying to sell his inventions and told C. 0. the following story:

Subject, in his wanderings about the city, had-by accident met the Frankfurt representative of a Munich firm which manufactures a device called the "Starlettograph which is used in the printing industry. Subject told the sales representative how his product could be improved and, as a

result of their discussions, WIROGUE met the director of the firm. The director became interested in an advertising device which Subject has developed and asked him to prepare a good working model in time for the Hanover Fair in April. The director also asked Subject, if the company supplied him with one of their devices, would he be able to incorporate his ideas for improving the machine in time for the Hanover Fair. Subject claims that he told the director he would modify the machine by the end of March and if the device works properly he would expect payment of 20,000 DM. According to Subject, before the director returned to Munich he promised to send a device to Frankfurt immediately upon arrival. The name and address of the firm is:

C. O. and Subject met at the American Consulate since Subject's apartment (DRC's former safe apartment) is being painted. Subject told C. O. he had been staying at the Balmoral Hotel and would move back into the apartment on Friday evening, 31 January 1964. C. O. and Subject went to the apartment which is indeed being painted and repapered.

C. O. paid Subject DM 1,000, DM 800 of which is for subsistence and rent for February and the remaining DM 200 to be applied to the one month's rent in advance required by the landlord.

C. O. told Subject that all copies but one of his original political recognition interview story had been recalled and the German language version of his Lebenslauf was now being used to provide the basis for a new story. C. O. told Subject that as soon as the new story was prepared, copies placed in the various files and the one remaining copy of the old story removed from its file, Subject would be for all practical purposes, his own boss.

C. O. told him that we have decided to help him get a new start by (1) paying the cost of having his dentures repaired, (2) by paying DM 200 on the DM 300 one month's rent in advance Subject must pay, (3) by providing DM 800 per month for subsistence and housing until he can be legally on his own, (4) by giving him at least one month's notice prior to termination and (5) by making him a present of all the household items now in the apartment including the iron, the vacuum cleaner, and the radio. Subject's rather perfunctory thank you was somewhat less than what C. O. had expected and when C. O. expressed surprise at Subject's lack of enthusiasm, Subject stated that he was most appreciative but was not very demonstrative.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

Subject said he had returned to Doctor Filner who said he could not work on Subject's dentures until approval was granted. Subject asked if we knew Doctor Feilner's estimate had been DM 750. C. O. said we knew and that he should go to the dentist who had given him the DM 400 estimate.

C. O. told Subject to obtain receipts for the one month's rental payment and for the February rental payment. He was also to call C. O. the week of February 2nd to arrange a meeting so that C. O. can pick up the receipts and Subject's copy of his old political recognition interview story.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, HARVARD

FROM : ORME K. DARONNAT

SUBJECT : WIROGUE

Don, I suggest that we reduce the quantity of some of the items listed on the attached and make WIROGUE a present of the remainder as part of his resettlement.

I have been emphasizing to Subject over the past weeks that President Johnson's economy drive has affected all agencies and departments. Subject, therefore, has been conditioned not to expect money for BKZ or for furniture or a termination sum. Any or all of these would normally be provided in a case of this kind.

I feel that if we pay to have his lower denture repaired, approximate cost DM 400, make Subject a present of the household items listed, and continue to pay him subsistence for a month or two after we notify him he is on his own, we will, I believe, get rid of him as cheaply as possible and without serious complaints.

COMMENTS:

C. O. met Subject and paid him subsistence for the week ending 31 January 1964. He was told that we have received permission to increase his subsistence from DM 600 to DM 800 per month until his final resettlement. The extra DM 200 is to be applied to his rent. C. O. said that Subject would be paid DM 1000 on 31 January - DM 200 to be applied to one month's rent in advance, and the DM 800 to be rent (DM 200) and subsistence (DM600) for February.

C. O. said we were disappointed that he had decided to stay in his present apartment and take over the DM 300 rent. We had hoped he would be sensible enough to use this opportunity to save a little money. Subject's answer was that he feels that he should be able to afford the rent when he is turned loose and that if he can't afford that much rent he might as well be dead. Subject said he could not understand why C. O. was harping on the subject, that all he was asking for was one month's advance notice prior to being turned loose on his own. C. O. said he was willing to drop the matter as long as Subject did not come crying the blues to us later about needing money. Subject said that if things got really bad he would get a job. C. O. applauded and offered his congratulations but said he assumed this would only be a desperation measure. Subject did not like the joke.

WIROGUE proudly announced that he has made intensive efforts the last few weeks to sell 4 of his inventions. C. O., somewhat exasperated, told him he would never understand how such an obviously clever man could, for so many years, refuse to face up to his responsibilities to himself and society and live in a dream world of get rich quick schemes. Subject put on what is now a familiar act in which he acts terribly hurt because C. O. (his one true friend) does not have faith in him. C. O. told Subject that he is a great actor and added that he (C. O.) would think much more highly of him if he would think

about going to work like any normal person and fiddle with his inventions at night. C. O. reminded him that if he had not been able to come up with a successful invention after 1 1/2 years of our patronage he should get his head out of the clouds and join the rest of us. By this time Subject was beginning to sulk so C. O. took him out to lunch Later while taking a stroll, Subject stated that if the cold weather continued he was going to return to the Congo. C. O. hustled him into Woolworths and bought him some long underwear.

Subject asked if C. 0. had been able to get permission to have his lower plate repaired. C. O. told him he was to go to Dr. FEILNER between 1130- - 1230 Wednesday the 23rd of January for an examination. FEILNER would supply us with an estimate. C.0. would then get a decision on whether or not we could help Subject with this problem.

C. O. dropped Subject off downtown.

COMMENTS:

C. O. dropped by and informed Subject we will not be moving him into any more of our housing, that housing suitable for him is occupied and would not be available for some time. C. O. told Subject that he will give him 800 DM a month instead of the usual 600 DM. He is to take care of housing himself. He was advised to get economy housing and try to save money since the President's economy drive was affecting our budget and C. O. could not promise what kind of help, if any, could be given Subject when he finally leaves our custody. Many months ago C. O. had told Subject that upon his final termination we would see what help could be given him towards apartment rental, dishes, furniture, etc. C. O. felt that it would be a good idea to tell Subject that he should not expect a great deal of help when he leaves us, that he might receive very little, if any.

C. O. tried to discourage Subject from taking over the Kuwaldstr apartment, but Subject said he is working on an invention for the owner of the apartment and would try to swing some sort of deal. Subject asked if he could expect to receive some help if he had to pay rent in advance when he gets his new quarters. C. O. told him he would pay the first month's rent in advance but would require the receipt from Subject.

Subject said he would call C. O. as soon as he has made arrangements for living quarters for himself.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: WIROGUE
1100 hours

On this date Grady Elms, John Spiegler, Don McLaughlin, Bill Murray and John Wilms (Camp King) met to discuss the WIROGUE case. It was explained to Wilms that we have prepared a Lebenslauf for Subject and we are ready to take the next steps necessary for Subject's resettlement and that we wished to establish if, as Wilms told us some months ago, it would be possible to prepare a new political recognition interview story and replace the old copies with the new story. Wilms said it wat would be necessary to recover four copies of the old story, Camp King copy, the criminal Police copy, Nuernberg copy and the copy in the hands of the BPY, but he felt that this could be done. It was decided that months ago when the BND became interested in this case that copies had probably not been made of the story, only extracts to include Subject's name, his birth date, probably the names of his parents and an extract of the reference of Subject's activities with the Georgian Resistence Group. It was decided, therefore, that this same information should definitely appear in the new Lebenslauf. This was to be taken care of by having Subject's father's name be Frank Simon Sanders (since Subject's


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

name is Georg Frank Sanders and on the original story

Subject's father's name is given as Simon Sanders the new story will indicate that Subject's father's full name is Frank Simon Sanders which will explain Subject's middle name as Frank), In the paragraph refering to Subject's detention by the militia to make some reference to Subject's alleged activities in a resistence group. It is felt that if Subject's new story ever comes to light in the future, what was once reported as Subject's activity in a resistence group will be taken to have been misread and will only be warmly alleged activity in a Georgian resistence group. We all realize that if a copy has been made of the story there is nothing we can do about it anyway.

COMMENTS:

C. O. dropped by, paid Subject two weeks subsistence and thanked him for his note of sympathy regarding the death of President Kennedy.

Subject was told that his background story is complete and that we hoped we would soon be in a position to take positive steps toward his resettlement. Subject went into a long-winded explanation of why he thought it was wrong for a man to pay all his life for a crime when technically he had paid by serving his prison term. C. O. told him that unfair or not Subject's misdeeds have placed certain restrictions on his activities and nothing could be done to change that. He was reminded that with a new identity he will be in a position to establish himself and be a contributing member of society. Subject's answer was to the effect that he was not too happy to be contributing in Germany.

C. O. knows that the above is Subject's way of letting C. O. know he would like to be clean as a whistle, be able to use his true name and go back to France.

C. 0. told him that all things considered he could be a lot worse off and should think about building his future.

Subject then stated that he would repay all the money we had spent on him. C. O. told him that we did not want the money repayed that he would only foul-up our books. He was told that the best way for him to repay the debt would be to work hard and lead a decent life..

He was told that unfortunately we have not finished his legend and it will be a few more weeks until we can try to replace the old story with the new. Subject said that he hoped that he can get started soon because he is getting nervous just hanging around and not being gainfully employed. He reminded C. O. that C. O. had supposedly promised him BKZ and help on new furniture when he finally moved out on his own. C. O. reminded him that C. O. had not promised him anything at all but had said he, the C. O., would find out if any help could be given Subject in this area.

Subject backed down and then stated that his wish had been to go to South America and that C. O. had promised him this would be arranged. C. O. told him that our intention had been to arrange this for Subject but that it is impossible to accomplish and the matter would have to be dropped. Subject was told, as he has been told several times, that if he desires to go to South America he will have to arrange it on his own and after he has built up some work experience here in the F.R.

C. O. dropped in to see Subject, gave him cigaretts and 300 marks subsistence for the next two weeks. He was told that his legend is just about completed, that it is now being proof read and that our next step would be to have it accepted by the German authorities. When this has been accomplished all obstacles to his final resettlement will have been removed.

Subject said that he had been thinking a great deal lately about being turned loose on his own in the near future. He said that he hopes to have his latest invention perfected to the point where he will be receiving a substantial income at the time he leaves us. C. O. told him that it seemed liked he still is trying everything he can to keep from going to work, that he still is placing too much emphazis on "get rich quick" schemes. Subject denied that this was the case but C. O. does not believe him.

C. O. wished him luck in his plans but advised him that when it was time for him to be on his own he would not be given a long transition period. Subject said that up to now he has been working for the work shop owner without receiving pay of any kind but that sooner or later he would be receiving a check and asked what he should do when this happened. C. O. told him that he could see no problem in that if he cannot be paid in cash there is no reason why he couldn't take a check in the name of Sanders and cash it since he is registered at Camp King. Subject said that it might be in a kind of a check that is paid directly to ones bank account. C. O. told him that the answer to that was simple, that he should say that he has no bank account.

C. O. doesn't know what Subject was trying to get at but is sure that he has something in mind. He then asked C. O. to find out what the rent would be on the Kuhwaldstr apartment,

C. O. met Subject and paid him two weeks subsistence. Subject was in extremely good spirits and seemed quite pleased to see C. 0. He stated that things are going better and better for him that the mechaniker with whom he is working had given him a new electric razor for having solved a difficult mechanical problem which had plagued the shop for some weeks. Subject Said that he has managed to complete two of his inventions and, another device which he had been working on for the mechaniker had been completed and worked so well it had been sent to a display in France. Subject said that he is making more and more contacts among the technical people here in Frankfurt and that his worry now is that he might be offered a good job and won't be able to accept it since he will require a Lohnsteurkarte and a Versicherungskarte. He then asked C.O.'s advice as to what could be done regarding this problem. C. O. said that he is hoping to have an acceptable Labenslauf completed in the near future and as soon as that story is substituted for the old he will receive the necessary documents. At that point he will be free to do anything he wishes as far as work and housing is concerned.

NOTE: C. O. has the necessary tax and insurance cards in his possession but will not give them to Subject until his Lebenslauf and legal position in Germany is satisfactory. If C. O. gives Subject the documents now he would probably go to work and besides earning money would accept our subsistence without notifying C.0. Subject said he wanted C. O. to understand that he was not complaining, that he was indeed most grateful for the training support he has received over the past months, but he is just as eager as we are to be on his own making his way in life. C. O. said he understood and appreciated this fact and hoped that everything would be in order within the next couple of months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Stage I

FROM: Chief, Resettlement Branch

SUBJECT: LEGEND MATERIAL REQUIRED FOR WIROGUE'S RESETTLEMENT

1. Since May 1962 HARVARD has been attempting to work out a sound resettlement for WIROGUE. Headquarters had authorized HARVARD to assist Subject in his desire to immigrate to South America. As the first step in this program, Subject was interviewed at Camp King and a story adequate to insure West German political recognition was presented to the German interviewer. Certain details of this story aroused the interest of the German government and it was necessary for steps to be taken to kill this unwanted interest. This development would not in itself have been too much of a problem, but in subsequent investigation of the procedure to be followed for immigration to South America, HARVARD learned that applicants are screened very thoroughly, given aptitude tests, etc. etc. This screening is performed by ICEM who is charged by the South American countries with the responsibility for insuring that any immigrant is thoroughly desirable. It became obvious to HARVARD that Subject would require a legend sufficient to withstand detailed interviews and sufficient to qualify him in some profession on the basis of his actual ability - the existing political recognition story does not provide this.

2. In discussions with Wilms and Wagner of the 513th, it was decided that a detailed life story should be prepared by CABEZONE and on the basis of this story a new political

# SECRET

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

-2-

recognition interview should be written which would replace those copies of the old interview now in the various files. A reasonably complete legend previously prepared by Alex Lembersky is attached and with additional information can be used almost as is. Since this life story will be notional, it will have to be written up in sufficient detail and plausible enough to provide Subject with the information needed for the filling out of various future job applications, to stand-up under detailed interviews to which he may in the future be subjected and, if immigration ever takes place, to satisfy those requirements. HARVARD feels that this can only properly be prepared by a native born Russian. HARVARD, therefore, requests Chief, Stage I to assign a Stage I interrogator knowledgeable on the Soviet Union to prepare a life story to include a detailed escape from Georgia to Turkey.

3. We realize that this request could involve considerable work but due to the peculiar problems inherent in the WIROGUE case, it is vital that we prepare Subject for a new life as a completely different person. Only by doing the job properly now will we be able to place ourselves in a position to satisfactorily sever subject's dependence upon KUBARK and reduce to a minimum the need for future contacts.

COMMENTS:

ORME K. DARONNAT, Case Officer

Case Officer dropped in to see Subject and paid him two weeks subsistence. Subject was very excited due to his success in applying for a patent, for a new type soup dish. Case Officer took great pains to praise Subject highly because he is aware that this has been a tremendous psychological boost for WIROGUE who was beginning to doubt his ability.

Subject for a long time has been attempting to get a patent but could not come by the necessary funds, approximately 200 DM. Case Officer asked him how he was able to swing this and was told the following story, some of which Case Officer already knew:

During the months that Subject has been in HARVARD's hands, he has kept himself busy by inventing various gadgets and devices. Some months ago he made contact with a mechaniker, Alfred Naegele, who has a work shop on 25 Glauburgstr. Subject has had this individual make certain small parts which Subject was not able to make, due to a lack of tools. Over the past months, Subject has won the confidence of Naegele and has been exchanging his labor for permission to use the work shop facilities. Subject has also solved job problems for the work shop owner who has now begun to take on specialized jobs only because he has Subject's talent and ability available to him. Subject continues to help Herr Naegele gratuitously since he feels that in time he will make the contacts which will be of help to him when he is finally on his own. Subject told Case Officer that one of Naegele's contacts had prepared the technical description and application for Subject's soup dish invention without cost to Subject. Subject will pay off the cost by helping Herr Naegele. Subject feels he can use this same procedure to patent other ideas which he has.

Case Officer noticed that on the patent application,
Subject was listed as an engineer living at Kuhwaldstr 51.
When Case Officer questioned him regarding the use of this
Kuhwaldstr address Subject said that he felt it was necessary
for the following reasons:

1.  While riding with Naegele to the Taunus
    one day and passing Camp King, Herr Naegele
    had remarked that the Camp was the place where
    Americans trained commandos and others for
    work of a secret nature:

2.  Since Case Officer had told Subject many
    months ago that we intended to give up the
    Kuhwaldstr apartment and he Subject wanted to
    do everything he could to make arrangements to
    establish himself on his own he had decided it
    would be best to use the Kuhwaldstr address
    because he would be receiving mail and did not
    want to inconvenience Case Officer by having
    him be a delivery boy.

3.  Subject felt that the use of this address
    would not break security since he would not use
    that address for any official reason, e.g.,
    police matters, etc., etc.

Case Officer still reamed Subject out thoroughly and told
him that even though our attempts to maintain maximum security
were probably 50% successful we should at least try. Case
Officer finally realized he was fighting a losing battle and
would succeed in antagonizing Subject and if nothings make
more difficulties for himself and told Subject they might as
well drop the subject. Subject kept insisting that he would
do nothing to jeopardize what Case Officer's organization was
trying to do for him and assured Case Officer he thinks out
very carefully what the results of any particular course of
action might be.

Case Officer told Subject that he is trying to complete
his legend and once everything is in order with the German
government Subject would be in a position to establish himself.
Case Officer told him that it is obvious his hopes for
immigration to South America should be shelled for a good long
time, that it would appear obvious Subject should establish
himself here in Germany building up a work background and then
if he so desired, immigrate. This would be without our help.

Case Officer said that his legend should be sufficient to satisfy any further inquiries he might run into. Subject asked what Case Officer's plans were for going to work and finding a place to live and asked what Case Officer's help would consist of. Case Officer told him that he would find his own employment and that since he would not know whether Subject should or would want to commit himself to a long term lease on an apartment,that Case Officer would probably recommend that Subject be given a couple of thousands of marks as a resettlement sum. This could be used by Subject at any time and in any way he sees fit but would eliminate the need for him to return to Case Officer for help towards an apartment, etc. Case Officer said his goal was to legalize Subject's case so that there would be no need for him in the future to come to us for help.

Subject asked just how good the legalization would be, would he be able to go to other countries and if not, then the exercise is a waste of time. Case Officer feels that the reason for Subject's question is that he would probably attempt to immigrate to the U.S. sometime in the future. Also he claimed that he brought up the question only to find out if he could go to other countries on a visitors visa if he makes contact with a firm that would require him to do so in the course of his duties. Case Officer told him that he would investigate these problems in due course but felt that Subject could probably get visitors or tourist permits to all the countries without any difficulty but if he applied for immigration to some country whose investigations require fingerprints and a check of Interpols, Subject would then be in trouble up to his ears (*HARVARD* has ascertained that Subject is not on file with Interpol but has not told Subject this since we may want to use the threat of being listed with Interpole as a future control.)

1. Case Officer dropped in to see Subject, gave him coffee, cigaretts, etc., and paid him two weeks subsistance. Subject said that he had run into difficulty with his invention and has been busy redesigning certain parts. Some time ago Subject made contact with a man who has a work shop and does specialized developmental work for various factories in the area. Subject has from time-to-time had certain parts made in this work shop. Subject says that he no longer can afford to pay the price this man asks and has made a deal with him whereby he helps the man out in his work shop and receives the time as credit toward any job Subject wants done. Subject told Case Officer that if he needed to contact him at any time and did not find him at home he could be reached at 558925 by calling and asking for Mr. Sanders.

2. Case Officer told Subject that his Legend is coming along pretty well and Case Officer feels that with a little luck we will be able to take definite steps toward his more or less permanent resettlement.

COMMENTS:

Case Officer dropped in to see Subject; paid him *some assistance* for the next two weeks and gave him cigaretts, coffee, booze, etc. Subject is still working dilligently on his invention (Electric Dictionary) which is making slow, but as he says steady progress. He says it could go much faster but he is limited by a lack of monty and therefore must be content with doing a little at a time. Case Officer asked him if he had heard from Braun.

Case Officer said that he hoped that he could *complete a working model* -of his invention because very likely no firm would really become interested unless he had a good working instrument to demonstrate. Case Officer told Subject that we had worked out a pretty good legend for him but there were a few necessary details to be added. Subject asked for an estimate as to how long his status quo would remain as is, because he would hate to be thrown out on the street without a chance to prepare for it. Case Officer, told him that he had nothing to fear in this respect *the story was ready* and Camp King the necessary action Case Officer would then inform Headquarters that his recommendation is to resettle Subject on the local economy with a reasonable amount of BKZ and help toward the purchase of furniture. Subject asked if this entire processing would take six months. Case Officer said it was possible that in any event Subject would be given adequate time to establish himself; i.e. finding a job, etc. Case Officer promised to see him definitely within two weeks.

Subject informed C.O. he had gone to the electrical firm BRAUN and had asked to see the Director of Research and Development. Surprisingly enough he was granted an audience with the "Great Man" and was allowed to explain his invention (electric dictionary). The Director was interested and told Subject he would discuss the idea with his engineering panel. If they were interested Subject would be contacted. C.O. said that he should negotiate for a job that resettling him in Germany would appear to be his best bet since he has more going for him here than he would in South America.

C.O. said he was working on his story (legend) and would recommend to Headquarters that Subject resettle in Germany with help toward BKZ and furniture.

C. O. told him that it was his opinion we should prepare a good story to replace the one he has now but to make sure that it would not require that he know a great deal of Russian so that if he should go to S. A. at a later date he would not have to study too long. C. O. said he would still notify Hqs. and see if they are willing to subsidize 6 mos. intensive Russian language training. If not we would concentrate on getting him established here and then at a later date discuss S. A. emigration. C.

CO dropped in to see Subject and found him in an exceptionally good mood.

He remarked that he was beginning to feel like a charity case and asked how long he would be on our hands. CO told him that there were three possibilities:

1. Subject could stay right here in Germany, find himself a job and CO would find out what help Headquarters would provide in the way of help toward an apartment and furniture.

2. Subject would have to study Russian for six months, since it is impossible for anyone to have been raised and worked in the Soviet Union without knowing some Russian. At the end of that time he would try to process him for S.A. (Subject was not told this but it is obvious that if he does not know Russian, once he gets to S.A., the first Russian he comes in contact with will realize he is not a bona fide refugee which would lead to trouble for Subject.)

3. There is a possibility he could be gotten to Chile. (John Wilms has suggested that through his contacts he might be able to get Subject to Chile, since the Chilean Ambassador owes him a favor.)

CO told Subject to think about the three possibilities and make and give CO his thoughts on the problem the next time they meet.

Alex Lembersky and ill Murray discussed the legend possibilities for WIROGUE -- It was established that since Subject speaks no Russian it is impossible to build a legend due to the fact that the simplest Arbeiter in the Soviet Union can speak some Russian.

It was decided that:

1. Rogue should be given an intensive course of Russian language instruction;
2. He be sent to Chile through John Wilm's connections, or;
3. He be told that nothing can be done for him and he be resettled on the local economy.

COMMENTS: CO met Subject and found him to be in a blue funk. Subject said that he was somewhat less then pleased with his German documentation that as long as he stayed Germany and was under the protection of the German Government he had nothing to worry about. Ee feels that as long as the US Forces are here he has no problems but that as soon as we leave Germany willprobably take a long look at the number of refugees here and take steps to encourage certain types to depart. Subject said that he could end up in all kinds of trouble. CO told him that in the first place the US Forces would be in Germany for a long time at least during his lifetime. In the second place Subject would be long gone before the Government changed it's attitude toward refugees.

Subject then said he was worried that when he got to S.A. the Columbian Government would probably check with the Soviet Gov't to find out if he was indeed an ex Soviet citizen. This would result in his being put in prison for entering the country under false pretenees. CO said there was no reason for the Columbian Government to check with the Sovs. Subject would arrive a bone fide immigrant fully checked out by the organization responsible fot to the Columbian Bovt. CO pointed out that the Columbian Govt would be crazy to alert the Sovs that one of their ex citizens was there with the possibility of having. him recruited to work for the Sovs. Subject was still dubious but stated that he would go anyway since that is what we wanted. CO pointed out that he had requestd help in going to SA and that we had found it necessary to get him a Reisenusvees to accomplish this. He was told that it is too late now for him to have misgivings that what is done is done and he would have to accept it.

Noven 13th, 1963

A discussion held in Bad Gojesberg on March 12th, 1963, between
Mr. Leonard, Chief of ICEM Mission in Germany and Mr. J. Riley of AFRF
revealed the following procedure taken by ICEM on refugee applicants
for migration to South America under the ICEM Special Program:

1. Applicant, if a refugee, must be recognized under UN High
   Commissioner's Mandate as a bona fide political refugee.
   (Note: All refugees holding a Reiseausweis automatically
   fall under the Mandate.)

2. A detailed curriculum vitae of the applicant must be sent
   by AFRF to Mr. Neegard. ICEM emphasizes that all time be
   accounted for since "gaps" are not accepted.

3. Applicant must supply documentary proof of profession or
   skill. In lieu of such documents, a letter of testimony
   from a current employer describing job skills and qualifi-
   cations or applicant will be considered.

4. ICEM will arrange to interview the applicant and to give tests
   to determine applicant's qualifications. ICEM will not accept
   tests which are made by other sources.

5. ICEM conducts its own security clearance on each applicant
   whether USEP or non-USFP case.

6. If applicant is found acceptable by ICEM, a work contract
   must be signed by the applicant prior to departure from Germany.
   ICEM has a placement service which arranges the job placement
   and obtains the work contract. This is a standard ICEM procedure.
   ICEM will not sponsor the applicant who does not sign a work
   contract.

7. The total procedure requires at least three months from the date
   the applicant's curriculum vitae is received by ICEM, Bad Godes-
   berg.

8. ICEM does not accept payment of passage by applicants nor is
   there an ICEM loan grant. ICEM charges DM 210.-- for men between
   18-51 for transportation including luggage. The charges for women's
   transportation amount to DM 162.-- (18-51 years old), DM 8.--
   for children between 5 and 18 years old. Transportation of children
   under five is free of charge. The total transportation cost per
   family will not exceed DM 586.--.

9. ICEM Placement Service in South American countries will meet the
   migrant on arrival, introduce him to the employer, and ascertain
   that all is in order. In the event that an applicant leaves this
   work, ICEM placement service will assist him to find another job.
   The placement service does not give assistance after the second
   job is found.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

10. Mr. Heegard stressed that each aplicant is processed thoroughly to avoia sending an unqualified persen to South America.

11. Basic Spanish, according to kr. heegard, can be learned by an aplicant over a period of three months - at least three hours of instruction per week. This should be done prior to departure from Germany.

12. During the processing the applicant receives a camphlet explaining the economic, social, political, etc. conditions of the country of his choice.

13. Mr. Heegard said that, in general, promotional opportunities are excellent in certain fields que to the lack of a qualified personnel.

14. The Special Program is the only one under which ICE operates for foreign refugees desiring to emigrate from Furope to South America.

15. Professions and skills required in South America are: (COLUMBIA)
    Fiectrical machine construction (Liektromaschinenbau): engineer, technician (drafting and operating), draitsman, master, cutting-tool maker (Schreiwerkzeugmacner), matrix maker for plastic material.
    Metallugy: Skilled founary worker; moulder (metall foundry); rolling-mill worker and technician, casting mould matrix maker (Metallguss-form-Schabionenmacher).

Orme A. Daronnat, Case Officer

COMMENTS: CO dropped in to see Subject and paid him two weeks subsistance. CO told Subject that there were two major hurdles to his immigration to Columbia. 1. ICE would require that he be thoroughly interviewed and tested to establish just what his technical qualifications are. It would, therefore, be necessary that we be careful to build his work history around which he not only could have been doing in the Soviet Union, but in which he could pass a practical examination and which the South American country needs and desires. Subject said that if his legend included schooling in electro-mechanical fields with the major portion of his work experience in development and improvement of devices and processes he could in fact pass any test practical test and subsequent interview.

2. We must assume that he is listed with INTERFOL since the French would almost automatically inform other European countries of Subject's disappearance from France. Subject agreed that this was a major problem but one that he could not help with.

Subject has resigned himself to being processed as a regular immigrant and has said that he will do whatever we require.

Memo for the record WIROGUE 27 Feb. '63

On this date Bill M. and Don McI. discussed the Airogue case with Earl Blake Cox(Chief, RMS, ANCONGEN Munich).

Blake was told that we have a case which we wish to help immigrate to South America. Blake was told that we had hoped to send Subject directly to ICEM(Subject cannot immigrate directly to South America but must have all arrangements handled through I CEM) but that in exploratory talks with Gus Elmendorf (Chief, ARRF) Gus had been of the opinion that our case would be thoroughly investigated, interviewed, tested, etc.; procedures which we wished to avoid since they might bring to light the fact that our case was not the person he claimed to be.

Blake agreed that Gus was correct in his thinking that if Subject went to ICEM on his own he would be interviewed and trade tested for a special program set up by ICEM to supply SA with certain higher types of skilled specialists, e.g. foremen, shop managers, etc.

Blake suggested that we make our case USEP eligible through AFRF and then refer him to ICEM. This procedure would probably give Subject more status in ICEM's eyes and eliminate some of the background investigation. Subject would also be referred as a self-payer meaning he would have the funds to pay his own transportation.

Blake asked if Subject would have a job waiting for him and was told that he would have no job but would have a letter attesting to the fact that there was $3,000.00 being held for him insalary and bonuses which he had received while working for the Army. Blake thought this arrangement would be satisfactory.

Blake feels that coming to ICEM as a USEP case through AFRF Subject would probably be accepted without question since he would have been thoroughly checked out by Camp King and AFRF thus eliminating the need for investigatory action by ICEM.

Blake was on his way to Bad Godesberg and said he would try to find out without arousing suspicion whether or not a refugee is fingerprinted and with what authorities the fingerprints are checked. He could also find out if a security investigation is made and now

COMMENTS:

Case Officer worked with Subject discussing the vital statistics which would have to acquired for and memorized by Subject in order to supply the refugee organization with certain factual information necessary for his processing. This information would also be vital if in casual conversation Subject was to keep from drawing suspicion to himself when queried about his homeland, etc.

C/O dropped in to see Subject and informed him that he would very likely be processed for South America through a refugee organization.

C/O told Subject that arrangements would be made for him to start studying Spanish as soon as practical.

Subject was told that his name was a common one throughout the Baltic region and therefore, he would be able to discuss that part of his legend with confidence.

COMMENTS: Subject told CO that he had gone to the Columbian Consulate at 10 am Hauptbahnhof and found it to be a one man, or rather, a one woman office. He said he found the representative to be a pleasant but rather incompetent German woman about 50 years of age. He told her that he was a refugee and wished to inquire about immigrating to Columbia. She told him that as an engineer he would have no difficulty being accepted but that he would have to contact the Ministry in Columbia through ICEM which would make all the arrangements. If everything worked out properly she would receive notification to issue a visa.

CO explained that it would be impossible for Subject to go to ICEM on his own. Subject was told that these developments would indicate that Subject should be processed as a regular refugee with a Volunteer Agency & and USEP support.

CO told Subject that he would advise Hqtrs of the new developments and get permission to use the new approach to his resettlement.

Subject was advised to work on his legend until CO would see CO by on Friday.

Memo for the record --- WIROGUE

11 Feb.'63 the undersigned asked Chief, CAMANTILLA why a European refugee who applied for immigration to a South American Country would be referred by that Consulate to ICEM.

The answer was that ICEM handles the immigration processing for refugees in Europe going to countries overseas. This saves the individual country the expense entailed in maintaining immigration and welfare offices and staffs. If a refugee goes to ICEM on his own he would probably be referred to a welfare Agency or be processed by ICEM itself. This would mean forms to be filled out in detail and time consuming background checks.

If the Refugee is a Cazantilla - USEP case most of the work would have been done by CAMANTILLA and would probably eliminate the need for the refugee to appear at I CEM in Bad Godesburg until the final stages of the processing.

Translation of German report from the BFV to the American Embassy, OCA, z.H. Mr. C. W. SCHMITZ in Mehlem.

Concerning Georg SANDERS, born 25 July 1919 in Tiflis/USSR. Present residence in Oberursel/Ts, Hohemarkstr. 145.

Cross reference, none.

As of the 14th July 1962 SANDERS is in the custody of an U.S. organization in Oberursel. It was alleged that he had arrived on the same date as a tourist from East- to West Berlin and defected there.

On the 28th of August 1962 he filed application for recognition as a foreign refugee.

On 29 August 62 he was interviewed, in the presence of a member of a U.S. organization, by the criminal investigation. During the interview SANDERS made untransparent statements concerning his defection.

Among other SANDERS said that he had been a leading member of a resistance group in the Soviet Union. Moreover he claimed that he evaded arrests by joining a Soviet tourist group with the assistance of friends.

The tourist group went on a guided tour of the Soviet occupied East zone of Germany. The group left Tiflis on the 10th of July 1962 arriving in East Berlin on the 14th of July 1962. Subject claimed that upon arrival to East Berlin he escaped immediately. However, SANDERS refused to make more detailed statements about his escape to West Berlin. Allegedly it was unknown to him how his friends had managed to place him into the tourist group.

We would be grateful if any communications or information concerning SANDERS inclusive a possible interview report would be forwarded to us.

# Memo to the File

## KIROGUE

On 5. Feb 63 CO went to Bonn to talk with OCA re the KIROGUE case and the SfV request for information on him.

CO discussed the case with KUBARK St 2fer Clarence Schmidt (true name) and explained that it is true that a Georg Sanders processed through Camp King for his political recognition, but that his name, story submitted for his recognition, etc., were complete fabrications concocted by Camp King to ensure that KIROGUE receives his political recognition and Reiseausweis. Moroever since it it is a fabrication that means that there are no reports of any kind which can be passed to the 3.V. Finally it was explained by Co that since Subj is an agent (or rather was) and not a normal defector he of course did not to through Stage 1 and 2 processing at Cabezone and therefore there are ro routine reports here that could be passed to the 3.V.

Schmidt answered that the reason the BfV made an inquiry is that because subjs statement for his recognition indicated that he defected from the Soviet Union and read like a report of someone who was debriefed by Cabezone. Moreover the story submitted for his reconition seemed so wenk that it immediately drew the ar..ntion of the BfV that the German organization responsible for the security of West Germany.

Mr Schmidt then went into a long explanation of the function of CCA and its relationship to the rest of the Intelligence (UC) Community and the BfV. He stated that as the sole coordinating body for the entire I AIS community OCA is the sole office for liaising with the 3fV and that any matter of interest of any component of the AIS comtunity must be handled by OCA, whether it be written or oral. It is therefore shown in the present case tit since the BfV requested info on a Georg Sanders it sont the request to OCA with the realization that OCA wold coordinate the matter with all the AIS components and moreover the answer passed to 36V would not be & KUBARK one (ever though the 3fV liaison people know OCA is primarily KUBARK) but a coordinated AIS one. It is for the above reason that QCA is very disturbed by the activity of Mr Johr. Willms of Camp King who throughout the years has repeatedly refused to clear with CC and handied any business he had with the off directly with the BfV and usually with the Chief of the 3fV. CO hed explained that even before he brought up the Rfv inquiry on Senders with Willms, Willms mentioned that he had already made an appointment tto talk with the Chief of the 3fy and thus would take up the matter as a service to us. Schmidt answered that Willms uses these ruses as excuses to go to Sonn and butter up the Chief of the 3fv.

In any event Schmidt stated that since he received the inquiry from the 3fV he is obligated to answer it and in order to keep


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

the BfV out of the case will inform it that Subj is of continuing operational interest to AIS. He requested that Cosere chip a cable stating that Subj is of ons interest and that it is conte plated that he will be resettled outside of Germany. This cable was sent to Bonn on 6 Feb 1963.

CO, uron return from Bonn, reported the above with Mr Iyack, Chief. Cabezone, who stated that though there is an agreement between the services and OCA, the Generels in Heidelberg back Mr Fillms in his personal relations with the German services and thus this battle which has been going on for years will probably continue for several more years. In any event if the matter of Hillms versus OCA comes up again it is strongly urged that Chief, Cabezone be queried as soon as possible.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

29 January 1963

SUBJECT: WIROGUE

On this date George List and the undersigned discussed CO's plans and thinking regarding WIROGUE's immigration to South America. Case Officer explained that since Subject is an exceptional case and not a bona fide refugee, we will not be able to take advantage of the normal immigration channels without taking the chance of being involved in fraud. Case Officer further explained that since WIROGUE's contact with the Consulate of his choice will not in any way be controlled by us, this immigration attempt will be a one shot operation and if it fails, we will not have a second chance because if he is turned down for immigration, any subsequent attempts he makes to immigrate will bring to light the fact that he had previously applied for immigration to another country. It is essential therefore that we plan for every contingency. Case Officer feels, based on HARVARD's experience, that when WIROGUE applies for immigration he will be required to give:

(1) the name and address of his present employer and probably the name of his supervisor and telephone number.

(2) what type of work he has been doing;

(3) proof that he will be able to support himself for a minimum of two years at the rate of $125 a month.

(4) proof of his professional qualifications.

(5) birth certificate.

(6) detailed information regarding his employment and residence addresses in the Georgian SSR

(7) details of the war-time military service.

Case Officer said that early next week he will meet with Wagner and Willms of the 513th and explain the above. If it is possible he will get them to agree to provide the details of (1) above in the event the Consulate should call as part of the routine immigration processing. (2) above will be taken care of in the same manner. Regarding (3), Headquarters has given us authority to expend up to $3,000 and Case Officer will 513th of this. They will be asked to provide a letter if required, stating that Subject has been associated with them (whatever cover organization they wish to use) since his defection in July and has roughly $3,000 in salary and bonuses being held for him. Regarding (4) whether or not is is adviseable to provide Subject with proof of his professional qualifications will be discussed with the 513th. (5) above, a birth certificate will probably not be necessary since so many defectors do not have these documents with them. Information on employment and residences will be worked up by the Case Officer from past. defector's BARs and with material available to SR 6. (6) above - this information may also be acquired through facilities of SR 6.

After discussions with the 513th, Case Officer will tell WIROGUE that we have been informed by Headquarters that if Subject still desires to immigrate to South America and is successful in immigrating, we have authority to provide financial assistance during the transistion period up to $125 a month. Since Case Officer knows WIROGUE, the next question will be, "How long will I receive this $125 a month?" Case Officer will reply, "Until you become satisfactorily established or we have

SUBJECT: WIROGUE

Case Officer received a letter from Chuck Pettit, addressed to WIROGUE (George Sanders), Hohemarkstr. 145. Case Officer opened the letter and found it to be from a Lt. Zircle of the Transportation Corps. The Lt. mentioned that he and his friend had enjoyed their conversation with Subject at the Bahnhof a short time ago and had found him very interesting. The Lt. said he received a great deal of pleasure from meeting people such as Subject with such interesting backgrounds.

He suggested that he and Subject meet for dinner in the near future.

Case Officer took the letter to Bob Bullock, told him a little bit about Subject's past and suggested that something be done to prevent the Lt. from continuing his friendship with Subject, since Case Officer felt that WIROGUE would probably use the Lt. 'for whatever he could get out of him. Bullock said he would have CID contact the Lt. and tell him to lay off for his own good. Bullock promised to find out if the Lt. had given Subject his address and to advise him that if he should run into Subject, he should not mention having written a letter.

Dear Mr. Sanders:

Just wanted to drop you this line to tell you again how much I enjoyed our conversation the other evening at the Bahnhof. My greatest experiences in Germany are the different people I meet, and it is always very pleasant to talk with someone such as yourself who has such an interesting background.

My friend felt rather silly at his attempted joke. The next time he either will have less to drink or will think more before clowning!

It would be a pleasure to see you again during my tour of duty in Frankfurt. Maybe if you have a free hour or so in the future you would want to have another supper in the Bahnhof!

COMMENTS:

Case Officer dropped in to deliver some Christmas cheer to Subject and gave him his Reiseausweis and Anmeldebestätigung. His HARVARD identity document was picked up.

Subject told Case Officer he had the feeling that Headquarters would advise us to turn him loose without any additional help from us and he was worrying because it would be difficult for him to get a job and apartment on very short notice. Case Officer told him that we are aware of this and that if it is recommended that he be resettled on the economy we are not in the habit of throwing people out in the street and that we would do everything we could to help him become integrated.

Subject was paid subsistence for two weeks. Case Officer promised to try to drop by the end of next week.

From time to time Subject tries to find out if Case Officer knows the details concerning Subject's past work for us and the reasons for our insistance that he was blown in the Congo. (A fact which he does not believe and therefore feels that the relationship was discontinued for other reasons.) Case Officer told Subject that he did not know and did not wish to know the details since in our job we are only told what is necessary for us to resettle the people for whom we are responsible.

COMMENTS:

Case Officer picked up Subject and took him downtown, bought him lunch and then bought him several items of clothing which he badly needed. Subject was greatly pleased although he cannot understand why we are doing so much for him. Case Officer explained that he is receiving nothing more than any other case that we are asked to help. Case Officer said that we were told originally by Headquarters to help Subject in any way that we reasonably could and that we with the cooperation of Headquarters are doing just that. Case Officer said that as far as he knows now, Subject will be helped to immigrate to South America and that we hope to send a dispatch to Headquarters explaining Subject's case as it now stands and we hope to receive soonest Headquarter's advice as to the future course of action we will take regarding Subject. Case Officer said that he hopes to be in a position within a week or two to advise Subject as to what we can and hope to do for him.

Case Officer said that in the final analysis if we do not help Subject to immigrate and he is turned loose on the economy, we would not throw him into the street, that he would be given a period of time in which to find a job and an apartment and that it is usually our procedure to help financially, at least the first month's rent and an additional subsistence payment until he receives his first paycheck. Subject was greatly relieved to hear this.

COMMENTS:

Case Officer dropped by to see Subject and pay him subsistence for the week. He was advised that our legal department would possibly recommend a patent attorney if and when he needed one. He replied that he already had had an attorney recommended to him by a contact he had made during the course of developing his invention. Case Officer asked him for the names of the contacts which he had made and he gave Case Officer the following information.

He said he has made the acquaintance of a salesman representative for several factories specializing in small electrical devices. The mans name is Wilhelm Salzmann, whose address is. Frankfurt/Main, am Tiergarten 52, telephone 492251. Subject said that this person had recommended a patent attorney by the name of Wilhelm Reichel, a Dr. Ing. Patentanwalt, Frankfurt/Main, Parkstr. 13, telephone 559165.

Subject told Case Officer that if he is lucky and his invention is successful prior to any definite arrangements we make for his immigration to South America, he will leave our custody and probably stay right here in Frankfurt. He said that he is aware he has commited himself to go to South America and will do so but all that he wishes to do if immediate success of his invention is not forthcoming, is to get a patent on his invention so he can negotiate at a later date from South America.

Case Officer feels that this is about the best we can expect from Subject. Case Officer has discussed this situation regarding the patent with John Morrison of the legal staff, who says that he will at least try to find out if this patent attorney is qualified and successful.

NOTE: Case Officer has learned that the patent laws in Germany are somewhat peculiar in that a patent attorney is a technical qualified man who can obtain patents on subjects in which he sas specialized and for which he has received a specialized education but he is not an attorney in the sense that he can deal with any legal questions which arise in the course of patent procedures or litigation in patent matters. Normally, an individual who intends to get a patent will hire an attorney who will contact a patent attorney. Between the two of them they can handle all problems and procedures involving a patent. This also can be worked in reverse.

We will further advise them that unless they have objections, we will start his processing for South America possibly with the sponsorship of one of the refugge organizations.

Subject agreed to this approach although Case Officer believes that he is hoping he will succeed in making himself financially independent by silling one of his inventions. If this should happen, Case Officer is sure that Subject will ask for his documentation and leave HARVARD housing and go on his own.

He has given up working on the device originally proposed by CO since he does not have sufficient tools and because some fil/ of the parts /itl must be ordered from the US. CO encourages him as long as it keeps his busy and helps to pass the time.

Subject has an extremely inventive mind and has explained several of his ideas to CO. They would appear to have commercial value. Unfortunatey Subject has neither the money to develop them nor is he in a position to get involved with patents or manufacturers at the present time.

He seems reasonably happy with his present status but CO anticipates, a hairy situation if upon applying for immigration to a SA country, the processing period takes a long time.

# Memo for the Record

20 August 1962

CC and Al met with Geo. L to discuss the Virogue situation and to inform him what was being done or planned re Tirogue's resettlement.

Al reviewed the situation as it now stood and explained that Edqrtre proposal that Subject be issued a backstopped Fremdenpass was completely unsatisfactory since it would not stand up under anything but the last casual investigation. It was explained that Camp King had been *affraided* informed of only the necessary details of Mirogues problem and had agreed that the approach should be cover story making Rogue a recent defector, an interview and political recognition. Geo. L agreed that this seemed to be the proper step and gave us the go ahead.

CO suggested that we have AFRF make official inquiry at the various SA Embassies and Consulates for detailed material giving immigration requirements. This is deemed necessary because the information is not normally given out over the phone and Rogue can be strusted to give CO only that information which will serve his purpose. He is not above telling us that an immigrant must have $ 5000.00 to be considered, etc. It is very important that Rogue have the right answers when he applies and is interviewed for Immigration. Geo. L agreed to CO's suggestions and proposed that CO have AFRF get started on this project soonest.

1400

Wirogue was taken to Camp King where he was 1st briefed on his story and then successfully interviewed. It is possible that Rogue will be completely documented within 2 or 3 weeks.

30 August

CO met with Gus E and Jack R and told them we were in need of detailed Immigration requirements.

They agreed to get cut an official inquiry to all the consulates and Embassys and attempt to find out the followings:

What documents are needed

What professions are indemand

How long is required for immigration processing

Does the immigrant need a certain amount of funds

Is a sponsor necessary or helpfull

That is the residence requirement for citizenship

What are the quota restrictions

Are there SA government agencies or private agencies who will help the Immigrant get started

etc

Notes: Rogue has already told CO that he cannot go to Argentina because he has "friends" there who would gladly turn him in to the authorities or make trouble for him in any way they could.

Rogue prefers Vuenesuela if he has a choice.

COMMENTS: CO picked up Subject and took him to lunch in the country near Feu Isenburg. Subject has been extremely edgy lately and it was felt by CO that a relaxing meal and 2 or 3 hours conversation might have a salubrious effect.

CO mentioned to Subject that if he were interested we might be able to find a radio or something along that line for him to build. Subject was very enthusiastic suggested that we get started soonest.

Subject was dropped off at his apartment and CO promised to come by as soon as he could find something to occupy Subject's time.

Subject was told that Edqtrs had suggested Argentine for resettlement because they had no quota restrictions and were in need of technicians. Subject said that Argentine was out of the question since he had acquainterees there who would be happy to stir up any kind of trouble they possible could.

Subject suggests that he go to SA on a tourist visa. According to him it would be much easier after his arrival to apply for immigration since he already would be there. This reason is quite valid and sensible but CO knows that Subject has 2 quite different reasons for making this suggestion. 1. with a tourist visa he has visions of having us finance him from country to country until he finds exactly what pleases him and, 2. He figures that with a tourist visa he can return to Europe without having committed himself irrevocably to immigration statuswith all it's attendant responsibilities for settling down, ste.

It is also obvious to CO that we cannot trust Subject to make inquiries himself at the various SA Consulates because he will tell us only those details which he wants us to know and unfortunately we haveno way of checking since the Consulates will not give out information re immigration over the phone.

Then the time comes .CO feels that we may be able to get the information we need by working through AFRF.

Subject prefers Venezuela.

PLACE: Osterstr. 1; Apt. 9

COMMENTS: Harvard CO and Al P. from TSS went to see Subject and informed him that Hdqtrs wishes his resettlement to be accomplished on the basis of documents as legalas possible. He was told that we will start the action necessary to get him a Fremdenpass and we hope a Reiseausweis. We explained that we must work very carefully and thouroughly that when he applies for a visa he must be prepared to give all the right answers since the SA consulates and Embassies do not give out immigration material without discussing the matter with the interested individual.

Subject is a bit sceptical that _all_ everything can be backstopped but is willing to play ball. Al took some preliminary informationfrom Subject and will discuss our problem with Camp King. CK has indicated that they might be able to help us get Subject resettled, particularly in Chile.

Subject is becoming extremely edgy and Harvard CO is hoping that that this case will start moving soon.

1 August 1962 - Sulintares fund.

CO visited Subj at his apt and found him getting very restless over the delay in his South America processing. He stated he does not want to continue to receive support from us but wants to get someplace where he can start working and be on his own.

Subj stated that he called the German firm which expressed an interest in his going to the Congo and was told to have Geduld. He stated in very clear terms that he is tired of having Geduld and hopes that something will soon happen.

He mentioned again that he does not want to have the name dePaneshkhet. CO told him that when we get the go ahead on a SAmerican country we will discuss the whole document picture and related matters.

COMMENTS:

CO visited Subj at his apt and paid him DM 100 subsistence for the period 29 July through 4 Aug.

Subj was told it at a cable was received from Hqs indicating that the people are definitely thinking about his resettlement in South America and wanted to make sure whether or not he had a preference. That was why, it was explained to Subj, that CO called on 24 July and inquired whether or not he had this preference.

Subj mentioned that he had thought seriously about his name on his phony Austrian passport and concluded that if at all possible he would like to retain the name Rainer, CO mentioned that under no circumstances would it be Rainer and was glad when Subj did not push the point. Subj mentioned however that when it is certain where he is going he will bring up the matter again.

To the list of documents he has previously claimed he needs (under his new identity) Subj added the International Drivers License.

Subj was most concerned about his future and asked all kind of questions to ascertain that everyone will be laid on when he goes to South America. Letter of the official is matter of the office rather with the Austrians. CO replied that if anything ever comes up, the officials will not check with the Austrians but with the pertinent South American officials who will have been informed by us to make his entry and life in the new country a possibility. Subj seemed to buy this but expressed the fact that something could go wrong.

Before CO left Subj Subj informed him that he will go around to the Venezuelan, Chilean and Colombian Consulates and request tourist information.

WIROGUE, former REDSOX Agent Candidate and AF Division Agent, has been quitclaimed and resettled on the local economy. This dispatch covers the WIROGUE case from Nay 1962 to March 1964.

Subject arrived in FRANKFURT/MAIN on 22 May 1962 and immediately made telephone contact with CABEZONE. He had been guaranteed a meeting with a Fran KUBARK representative who, he had been told, would explore KUBARK employment possibilities for him. He in the meantime would be attempting to market a telephone answering device which he had invented, and conduct an investigation into the disappearance of 30 million francs which had been misappropriated by members of the Congolese Defense Ministry. KUBARK's reasons for establishing contact were dictated, however, by the need to relieve Subject of his KUBARK supplied false Austrian passport in the name of Reiner, the need to institute or suggest a course of action which would encourage him to establish himself as a contributing member of society and, above all, prevent his return to the Congo.

Subject was met by Stephen R. LACKLEN and Roscoe MOSIEN and put up in a safehouse. He was relieved of his documents under the pretext that they were to be photographed and he would not need them for the time being since he would be given an identity document for use during the period of time he would be in KUBARK custody. LACKLEN explained that as an administrative officer he was interested only in taking care of his immediate needs but soon however he would be introduced to one who's business would be to work with him in an attempt to resolve his problems.

Since it had been decided that Subject was primarily a resettlement problem, Orme K. DARONNAT of HARVARD was introduced to Subject. DARONNAT told Subject that he would be working with him during his stay in Frankfurt while we were awaiting word on whether or not his services were needed by the Government. Subject stated that his greatestwish was to work for the "Company". If this was not to be, he hoped he would be helped to legalize and immigrate to South America.. He emphasized his obligation to complete his mission for the C.D.F. and claimed also he had to return to the Congo to conclude his contract even if we decided to employ him. C. O. told him our first order of business was to establish the need for his services and in the meantime he could attempt to market his invention.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 101

-2-

HARVARD needed time to establish Headquarters interest in the amount and type of assistance Subject should be given. Also he was still an unknown quantity, restless, and from early cable traffic a potential troublemaker. In view of these considerations we were anxious to make his stay in Frankfurt reasonably pleasant and reduce his desire to return to the Congo; therefore, he was provided with subsistence and confortable quarters.

DARONNAT introduced David E. COULLIARD (MKTOPAZ) explaining to Subject that we would be wise to discuss documentation for him since a long time might elapse before we had the answer to Subject's possible employment with us and if the answer was negative, we should be prepared to take steps to legalize him. COULLIARD explained the merits of a Fremdenpass and a Reiseausweis; i.e., a Fremdenpass could be obtained without much difficulty but control and security would be limited to the time Subject remained registered at the place from which the Fremdenpass was issued. Therefore, the Fremdenpass might well be a short range solution unless Subject could get an immigration visa to desired country of resettlement in a short time. On the other hand the issuance of a Reiseausweis could completely legalize Subject, but would have to be issued on the basis of a false defection story and should not be done unless absolutely necessary. Subject stated that he hated Germans and no matter what happened would not stay in Germany..... He suggested that he be helped to immigrate to the U.S., Canada, England, Australia, etc. C. o. told him that with his criminal record of arrest and imprisonment in France immigration to other than S.A. was out of the question and even this was in doubt. He stated if KUBARK employment was not possible he would hope to get legal documentation in the name of de Panaskhet (his brother's name) and take up legal residence somewhere.

By this time (June) HARVARD C.O. had an inkling that Subject was not eager to return to the Congo but surmised that his nuisance value might be such that he could parlay his position into something better. HARVARD C.O. felt that Subject's dislike for the Germans was real but was emphasized by him in order to benefit as much as possible from a prolongation of his new association with KUBARK. He also stated that he was willing to discharge any responsibility to the Congolese by mail, thereby confirming C.O.'s suspicion that he did not in fact want to return to the Congo and was only interested in prolonging his stay in FF/M and benefiting therefrom.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 102

-3-

In July 1962 Headquarters advised HARVARD to provide Subject with resettlement assistance including help in immigrating to South America. Consequently, he was told that although we appreciated his past service the economy drive in Washington precluded employing him in any capacity. He was bld that we were authorized to help him realize his stated desire to immigrate to S.A. but that we would not be able to "wave a magic wand" and have him settled there with a job and a rosy future. He was told we would help him in whatever areas we could but he would be expected to apply himself to the problem and drop all plans to return to the Congo.

Subject at this point was so discouraged by his inability to sell his invention, the realization that his services were not needed by KUBARK and weeks of inactivity that he willingly agreed to forego returning to the Congo and give up all documentation in the name of Reiner if something could be done to give him hope for the future.

Headquarters had recommended that Subject be resettled on the basis of a backstopped Fremdenpass; however, Clarance W. LEIBROCK (MKTOPAZ) and DARONNAT after much discussion of the relative merits of the types of documentation available, decided that only a Reiseausweis would stand up under the investigation of immigration authorities and in addition, it was felt that there was no guarantee Subject would be going to South America. Therefore, if he were required to stay in Germany for a prolonged period of time, it would be best to provide him with complete FEDREP recognition processing resulting in a Reiseausweis. A subsequent discussion with ODIBEX Camp King reps confirmed this reasoning and, with the concurrence of Acting Chief AD/FI, Subject was briefed by Camp King representatives and then interviewed for political recognition. He received political recognition on the basis of a fabricated story in which he purported to be a Georgian who defected from East Berlin while with a tourist group.

HARVARD felt that progress was now being made but a temporary setback resulted from a query initiated in December 1962 by CAVATA to OCA Liaison Officer Bonn requesting full traces, interrogation reports and all information available on Subject. David R. REINBOLD of HARVARD informed OCA by cable and in a subsequent visit to Bonn that Subject's name, George SANDERS, story submitted for recognition, etc. were complete fabrications to insure that WIROGUE received political recognition and a Reiseausweis. It was explained that WIROGUE


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 103

-4-

was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case of no AIS ops
interest and not a routine CABEZONE case. OCA stated that
the political recognition interview story had naturally drawn
the interest and attention of CAVATA.

OCA

advised REINBOLD that CAVATA would be kept out of the case
by being told Subject was of continuing AIS ops interest, and
HARVARD could go about its resettlement efforts.

Subject by this time had agreed to immigrate to any
South American country with the exception of Argentina, where
he claimed he had acquaintances who were not kindly disposed
toward him. At first Subject suggested that he go on a
tourist visa and apply for immigration status after his arrival.
Although this suggestion was quite sensible and valid DARONNAT
knew that his reasons were: 1) with a tourist visa, he had
wisions of having KUBARK finance him from country to country
until he found exactly what would please him, and 2) he knew
that with a tourist visa he could return to Europe without
having committed himself irrevocably to immigration status
with all its attendant responsibilities.

Available South American immigration data indicated that
a prospective immigrant would have to have personal qualifications
sufficient to make him an attractive prospect plus proof of
financial solvency sufficient to provide self-support at the
rate of $125 per month for two years. Headquarters approved
the expenditure of $3,000-for this purpose and discussions
with MKTOPAZ and Camp King resolved the necessary documentation
problems.

Fully documented and armed with the assurance that there
would be financial assistance available during his first
months in South America, Subject applied at the local Colombian
Consulate for permission to immigrate. HARVARD had hoped that
letters of solvency and letters of recommendation would be
sufficient to enable Subject to process with a minimum of red
tape. This was not to be and Subject was informed he could
only immigrate by processing through the Intergovernmental
Committee for European Migration (ICEM).

This problem was discussed with a cleared official from
Refugee Migration Section AMCONGEN, Munich, and the Chief of
CAMANTILLA. HARVARD was informed that European refugees
immigrating to South America are processed through ICEM thereby
eliminating the need for individual countries to maintain
immigration offices and welfare staffs. Unfortunately, since


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

-5-

ICEM is responsible for the immigration processing, it is determine to pass only high level types and, therefore, conducts stiff security investigations and gives detailed interviews and job testing to all prospective immigrants.

By now it was apparant that if the disappointments and frustrations connected with this case were ever to end a reappraisel must be made to decide whether or not to go ahead and subject WIROGUE to several possibly very searching interviews. There was also the possibility he would be inter- viewed in Russian (practically non-existant) and Georgian (less than fluent). With these language deficiencies we khew he would be immediately suspect if interviewed by any recent refugee from the Soviet Union. We were hampered by not being able to insure Subject'smooth processing through ICEM, and by the fact that if we did help him to process we would be making USEP, ICEM and CAMANTILLA a party to fraud with the danger of any slip-up causing embarrassment to KUBARK, ODIBEX and to the Federal Republic. We were not sure that the aforementioned risks were worth taking and the problems worth trying to resolve when it was obvious to HARVARD C.O. that if Subject did get to South America and became disenchanted, his first stop would be the local U.S. Consulate or Embassy where he would ask to see the KUBARK representative and once again force KUBARK to become directly involved in his personal problems.

In spite of the hundreds of hours of Case Officer time, the many discussions necessary to pull together adequate information regarding immigration, etc., HARVARD was faced with the realiza- tion that to prepare Subject for South American immigration could take many more months. We were faced with the fact that until Subject was provided with a detailed life history containing the information required by prospective employers and/or immigration authorities he was not in a position to be resettled anywhere, let alone South America. We knew a new approach would have to be tried if HARVARD was ever to be in a position to satisfactorily sever Subject's dependence upon KUBARK and reduce to a minimum the need for future contacts. HARVARD C.O. felt that Subject should be told outright that immigration to South America was not practicable under the present circumstances and what would be done would be to provide him with a detailed life history with enough factual information needed for the filling out of any future job applications, to stand up under detailed interviews, and, if immigration ever took place, to satisfy immigration requirements.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

-6-

DARONNAT told Subject that any South American immigration thoughts should be shelved, that he should work and establish himself in Germany and if he intended to immigrate in the future he would have to do it on his own. It was pointed out that he would have to study and learn Russian, that any professed Soviet refugee arriving in South America without Russian would be immediately suspect by the emigres there.

ODIBEX authorities at Camp King had readily agreed that Subject's original political recognition interview story did not provide the proper framework around which a decent legend could be built. It was agreed that given a detailed legend prepared to HARVARD's satisfaction ODIBEX could prepare a new political recognition interview story and would remove copies of the old story from the various FEDREP files and replace them with the new.

HARVARD's problem was explained to Chief, Stage I, CABEZONE who assigned Gerald H. BESDINS to prepare a life story to include a detailed escape from the Georgian S.S.R. to Turkey.

By 1964, an excellent legend had been written, a new political recognition interview story prepared and substituted for the old and to HARVARD's satisfaction for the first time since Subject had arrived in HARVARD's custody, the way was clear for a final resettlement. DARONNAT informed Subject that the time had come to part company, that he was completely legalized and documented and was now in a position to take his place in society. Subject was given his legend in German, complete legal documentation, one month's final subsistence and, since he had taken over a dropped CABEZONE safehouse, was given dishes, and various items to set up housekeeping. He was quitclaimed and warned that he should always keep in mind the consequences of any action on his part which would result in having his fingerprints taken. (Subject has often expressed the wish to immigrate to the U.S. or even Canada or Australia and with his new identity could probably do so. He has been told that these countries do thorough security investigations and a check with Interpol would disclose his true identity. HARVARD has established that Interpol has no interest in Subject but we feel his ignorance of that fact provides us with some control over any steps he might take to emigrate from Germany.) Subject has been told however that there is nothing to prevent him from visiting other countries or even entering as a technical representative.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

-7-

HARVARD as the final step in the WIROGUE case bas arranged through to be listed in for Subject so that any attempt to immigrate to any country will bring him to the attention of KUBARK and appropriate action can be taken.

In summary, everything has been done to insure Subject a successful future free from problems resulting from his "black" association with KUBARK. On the other hand, there is no reason for KUBARK to fear any future attempts by WIROGUE to return to the fold under veiled threats to reveal all. With his criminal background he is aware that he can be brought to the attention of French authorities. He also believes that KUBARK's position in the FEDREP is such that we have nothing to fear from any action on his part.

At the time of this writing Subject has a position as research and development engineer with a Munich firm. He allegedly receives DM 1500 per month, has an expense account and is to receive a percentage of all profits realized from the sale of any devices he develops. He expects to move to Munich permanently about the end of May 1964.

# BIOGRAPHY OF GEORG FRANK SANDERS

1. IDENTITY:

A. FULL NAME: Georg Frank SANDERS

B. NAME AT BIRTH: Georg SANDERS, as featured in my birth certificate and all other Soviet documents. However, upon arrival in the West, I added to my first name the name of my father, Frank. While in the USSR when the patronymic was required, I was referred to as Georg Frankovich SANDERS.

C. OTHER NAMES USED: I never used any other names but I was called by my mother by a Georgian diminutive 'Zhori', and by my Russian friends 'Zhora' or 'Zhorzh'.

2. BIRTH:

A. DATE OF BIRTH: 25 July 1919

B. PLACE OF BIRTH: Tiflis, Georgia, USSR. Tiflis is the old Russian name. The Georgian as well as the present official name is Tbilisi.

C. NATIONAL ORIGIN: Georgian

3. CITIZENSHIP:

A. AT BIRTH: Soviet. From 1917 (October Revolution in Russia) until 1921, Georgia was governed, from the downfall of Czarist regime, by Menshevists and partially occupied by Turk, German and British troops. Only in 1921 did the Soviet government in Georgia officially come to power. However, all persons born during this transition period were classified later as Soviet citizens.

B. PRESENT CITIZENSHIP: Stateless

4. RELIGION: Orthodox (pravoslavnyy). Being raised in a godless society, I practiced my religion to a very limited extent in my youth, and, due to existing conditions in USSR stopped going to the Church in my adult life.

5. SOCIAL ORIGIN: Intelligentia (sluzhashchiy); my father was an engineer, and my mother - a white collar worker.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

## 6. PROFESSION: Electro-technician, an equivalent of German
'Ingeneur without diploma' (no college graduate)

A. LAST OCCUPATION: Chief electrician (starshiy elekto- tekhnik) with MIKHA-TSKHAKAYA RTS.

7. LAST RESIDENCE: Shota Rustaveli Street (ulitsa), #25 (private home of my common-law wife, Nina GANDELI) in MIKHA-TSKHAKAYA, Kutaisi Oblast, Georgian SSR.

8. MARITAL STATUS: Single. From 1946 to the time of my escape I lived in a common-law marriage with Nina GANDELI, nee TAKTASHVILI, born 1920. When I first got to know her, she was married to a post-office employee but her marriage was an unhappy one. Her husband was much older and the marriage had been arranged by her parents, old fashioned farmers from a distant village who were happy to marry their daughter off to a relatively educated and well-to-do man. By the time I was drafted into the service Nina and I were lovers. When I returned from the war, I moved in with her for her husband had been killed in action during World War II and she lived, with her daughter born during this time, in a small home inherited from her husband. Her parents were dead, and she worked as a mail carrier for she had very little education. During the later years of our life together, I discovered that Nina was having affairs with other men. This caused frequent quarrels at home, and made my life unbearable. Finally, the woman became pregnant, and since I was positive that it was not my child, I decided to end our relationship. This was one of the reasons for my defection. I have no children of my own.

9. PARENTS:

A. FATHER: Frank SANDERS, born circa 1885 in the Baltic area, came to Russia proper circa 1910 and worked as a civil engineer in the Baku, Batumi, and Tbilisi areas. In 1918, he married my mother in Tbilisi. He died in 1924 of an accident at his place of work. I do not remember my father at all, but knew from my mother that he was a very good and kind man, and was well liked.

B. MOTHER: Maria SANDERS, nee KANTCHELI, born circa 1885 in a small village near the Azerbaydzhanian border in Tbilisi Oblast. She was an only child, and when her parents died of old age, within a few years of each other, she moved to Tbilisi and worked as a clerk in various private enterprises until she married my father. After her husband


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

-3-

died, she went back to work. She changed her place of
employment several times and the only job I can remember
was her last employment as a cashier with the shoe-
repair shop (artel) on Sovetskaya Ulitsa in Tbilisi.
She died in 1934 of a heart attack.

10. BROTHERS AND SISTERS: None at present. I had a brother Leon
    born 1923 who died some six months after his birth.

11. OTHER RELATIVES: I knew that my father had relatives in the
    Baltic area but our family had no contact with them and I
    did not know any of them. I had no close maternal relatives,
    and the distant relatives in my mother's home village had no
    contacts with my family disapproving my mother's marriage to
    a 'foreigner' of another faith. I never visited the home
    village of my mother.

12. CLOSE FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES: I never had any real close
    friends, but I was somewhat closer to the following persons
    in town:

(1) Director of RTS, who was transfered in 1959 to Rustavi,
Georgian SSR.

(2) Rayon veterinarian who had his office in the rayon
veterinary clinic and travelled extensively in the rayon
área visiting collective farms.

(3) Club librarian (a girl friend)

13. SPECIAL SKILLS: I like to invent gadgets and built up a
    relatively good home work shop

14. LANGUAGES: Georgian - native

Russian - from school and contacts with
population in Russian speaking
area and in the service.

German - from school and residence in Germany

English - from Technicum, home study and
association with Americans in
Germany.

15. FINANCIAL STATUS: None


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

16. EDUCATION HISTORY:

1927-1934 - Trudovaya Shkola #107 (10-year school, desyatiletka) located on the corner of Prospekt Mikhaylovskiy and Kirochnaya Ulitsa, in Tbilisi, (Presently PLEKHANOVA and MARDZHANISHVILI Streets, respectively.) Prior to 1927, it was the German Real Gymansium, but although converted into a srednyaya shkola at that time, the instruction was conducted in German, until 1930 when it changed to Georgian. The majority of the students were Georgians. Russian language instruction was given two hours a week and Georgian one hour a week, until 1930. I completed seven years at this school and then due to the death of my mother, entered a technicum where I would be given board and quarters.

1934-1938 - Tbilisskiy Elektro-Tekhnicum, located on Sovetskaya Ulitsa in Tbilisi, in a two-story building with a yard where the shops and the students' hostel were located. In summer 1934, I submitted an application to this school supplemented with the seven-year school certificate and a photo. In July or August I passed the entrance examinations consisting of Mathematics, Physics, written and oral Georgian and Russian and when I saw my name posted on the school's bulletin board. I knew I had been accepted. I paid no tuition and was given a small stipend just enough for a bare living. The hostel accommodations where I shared a room with three other students were free. On the first floor of the technicum building, near the school office, was located a students cafeteria where meals could be bought cheaply. The food was of poor quality. The female students of the school lived in a small annex on the same street, two or three blocks from the technicum.

For four years I studied physics, mathematics, history, English, Georgian language and literature, Russian language and literature, and from 1936 or 1937 - Constitution of the Soviet Union. The general subjects were on a high school level. Specialized subjects given at the technicum were technology of metals, theoretical mechanics, strength of materials, electrical machines, electro-techniques, electrical gears (privody), electrical measuring instruments, drafting. The students were also given military and physical training. Classes ran from September to July of each year; summer recesses I spent usually in near-by kolkhozes in a group organized by the technicum to help out farmers with their crops.

Examinations were held twice a year, prior to New Year and at


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

-5-

the end of second semester, and were graded by the following
system:

5 - Otlichno (excellent)

4 - Khorosho (good)

3 - Posredstvenno (satisfactory)

2 - Plokho (bad)

1 - Ochen plokho (very bad)

The first three were passing grades.

In the spring of 1938, I took the final examinations, oral
and written, and was issued a diploma. It was a one-page
certificate and indicated that I had attended the technicum
for 4 years. It listed the grades I had received on the
various subjects and showed that I was graduated as an
electro-mekhanic.

All graduates were assigned to various places of employment
where they had to stay not less than two years. This is a
form of repayment for the money which the government spent
on their education. I was sent to the MIKHA-TSKHAKAYA M.T.S..
which in 1958 was converted into an R.T.S.

17. EMPLOYMENT HISTORY:

1938 - 1941 and 1946 - until defection - Mikha-Tskhakaya
M.T.S. (Machine-Tractor Station), later converted into R.T.S.
(Repair Technical Station) - Machino-Traktornaya and Remontno-
Tekhnicheskaya Stantsiya, respectively. Mikha-Tskhakaya,
referred to by the population simply as Tskhakaya, was the
rayon center of Tskhakayskiy Rayon being renamed so after the
famous Georgian Revolutionary Mikha Tskhakaya (the old name
of the town was Akhal-Senaki and Akhal-Senakskiy Rayon,
respectively). M. Tskhakaya was one of the organizers of the
Georgian Communist Party. The town has now about 10,000
population and is located on the RR line Samtredia-Sukhumi
(the main connection between Tbilisi and Moscow) with the
junction to Poti, the Black Sea resort. The town is located
between two large tributaries of the Rion River: Tsivi and
Terakhi Rivers. On the latter, located a few kilometers
from Mikha Tskhakaya, is situated a small hydro-power station
where I was a part-time employee upon my return from World
War II.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 112

-6-

At the M.T.S. (which was in 1958 converted into R.T.S. after the machines and equipment were distributed to the local grain and grape producing collective farms with the sole responsibility of repair of these machines left with R.T.S.) I soon became the foreman of a small brigade of electro-mechanics responsible for the maintenance and repair of electrical parts for those agricultural and other machines. My starting salary was 400 or 500 rubles, but it was increasing rapidly and when I was drafted into the army, my salary was almost doubled by that time.

For personal reasons I returned to this town after my discharge from the service, and obtained my old job. I also got a job as electro-technician with the above described power station which supplied power for the town and the rest of the rayon. I was assigned this second job since there was a lack of qualified personnel after the end of the war. I worked in the second shift at the power station from 1947 until 1953 (when the position was filled by a young graduate of Kutaisi technicum) earning 700 rubles in addition to my basic salary with the R.T.S. Prior to my escape, my income was about 120 new. rubles before deductions. I also had some additional week-end income from repairing electric household appliances, radios, etc., for the local citizens. The old currency was converted 10 to 1 in 1961.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

18. MILITARY HISTORY

A. DRAFT BOARD REGISTRATION: In the summer of 1939 1
received a notification from my rayon-voyenkomat
(draft board) of my rayon and reported there on a
specified date before the draft board, then I was
sent in a group of other future conscripts to the
rayon polyclinic for a medical check-up. I had lost
the first joint of my left thumb and index fingers
during an accident at the job, and when the findings
of the medical examinations were reported to the draft
board, I was rejected for active duty and deferred
into the reserve. At that time my pripisnoye
svidetelstvo (registration certificate) was exchanged
for the military booklet.

B. INDUCTION DATE: On about 26 August 1941, I received a
notice instructing me to report to the rayvoyenkomat
on 27 August. I reported there and was notified to
report for induction on the following day. Then I,
with a group of either 80 or 100 conscripts from my
rayon, was put on the train and via Tbilisi travelled
to Baku, where the group was put in so called Salyanskiye
Kazarmy (Salyany Barracks) located on the outskirts
of Baku, on the highway to Salyany and the Iranian
border.

C. BRANCH OF SERVICE AND SERIAL NUMBER: I served in the
anti-aircraft artillery. I had no serial number
(which is never issued in the Soviet Army).

D. BASIC TRAINING: I took basic training at Salyany barracks
in Baku for a period of two months. One month. I took the
regular basic training, and the remaining month improved


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

-7-

my qualifications as a car driver (I learned how to operate an automobile while working on electric detail on car repair at my M.T.S.). I can not recall the unit number where I went through the basic training. At that time the barracks were full of troops, basically infantry and artillery units which rotated quite frequently.

E. SPECIALIZED COURSES: One month's driver's training as mentioned above.

F. RESERVE STATUS:

Summer 1939

Rejected from the active duty for medical reasons and given reserve status.

Fall 1946

Discharged from the army and after submitting my travel and discharge papers to my Rayvoyenkomat was issued a new military booklet which contained an indication of my reserve status. I was never recalled for military training or duty of any kind after my final discharge from the service.

G. CHRONOLOGY OF MILITARY SERVICE:

In a group of other enlisted men, I was sent by train to the 2nd battery of the 253rd separate anti-aircraft artillery division (OZAD-ogne-zashchitnyy artilleriyskiy divizion). Commanding officer of the battery was Lt. VAKS. Commander of the vzvod upravleniya (administration platoon) of the division was Lt. ENDELADZE. Deputy divizion commander for political affairs was Capt. CHOKHA and politruk of my battery was Senior Lt. SAMARIN. Major Vlado (Vladimir) GURGENIDZE was the commanding officer of OZAD and in February 1943 he was also appointed the commander of the PVO (protivo-vozdushnaya oborona or anti-aircraft defense) in the town of Michurinsk. The headquarters of the division was located in Michurinsk, while the battery itself was stationed near the station TARASOVO near the settlement of Konskoye, 7 km. from Michurinsk and 6 km. from the six marshalling yards located at Kochetovka station. A higher HQ was in Tambov and was at first commanded by Col. CHERNYAVSKIY and later by Col. TSVETKOV, a demoted General.

When I first arrived in Michurinsk, I was assigned as a truck driver with the division's supply platoon (khoz-vzvod


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 115

or khozyaystvennyy vzvod) commanded by Junior Lt. MAKAROV,
but later I made the acquaintance of the above mentioned
ENDELADZE, a countryman, and through latter's intervention
was assigned as a personal driver to division commander
GURGENIDZE, also a Georgian, who was later promoted to Lt.
Col. and who kept me with him until I was discharged from
the service.

H. PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS: After six months in the service,
I was promoted to yefreytor (corporal), and at the end
of my first year to Junior Sergeant. In 1944, I was made
a sergeant.

I. DECORATIONS: None

J. DATE OF DISCHARGE: I was discharged from active military
duty at the end of September 1946. I received my travel
orders and per diem funds at my unit in Michurinsk and
turned them in at my rayvoyenkomat. In 1955, I was given
another medical check-up by orders of the voyenkomat and
discharged from the reserve for medical reasons (same as
before) and issued a so called belyy bilet (white ticket
or permanent deferment from service).

19. RESIDENCES FROM BIRTH:

1919 - 1926 Several addresses in Tbilisi

1926 - 1934 Tbilisi, Kirochnaya Ulitsa #35, an
apartment in a two-story house, formerly
a private house, later taken over by
the State ZHAKT (housing organization)
enterprise. After my mother's death,
I entered the local electro-technicum
and moved to the students' dormitories.

1934 - 1938 Tbilisi, Ulitsa Sovetskaya, # not recalled,
student hostel of Tbilisi Electro-Technicum.

1938 - 1941 Mikha Tskhakaya, Ulitsa Tsulukidze, #14.
Here I rented a room in a private one-
story house of a retired RR switchman,
Ilya LORDKIPANIDZE, who had to rent a
room in his house to boarders to
supplement his pension. Ilya's wife, Keto
(Catherine), for an additional charge
took care of my laundry and cooked for me.
The couple had no children of their own
and treated me as their own son.

Army Service

Mikha Tskhakaya, Ulitsa Shota Rustaveli, #25, the private home of my common-law wife, Nina GANDELI. I was in love with her and had an affair with her before I went to war. During the war, I found out that Nina's husband was killed in action and decided to return to Tskhakaya to be near her. I moved in with Nina and continued to live with her without registering our marriage at the local ZAGS (registrar office for marriage, deaths and births). Although I insisted on legalizing our union, Nina was always opposed, being unhappy in her first marriage, and wanted to feel free to end the relationship at any time.

For the last several years Nina, as I found out, was meeting other men during my absence from home. A rift between us developed and grew more and more with the passing of time. Being deprived of Nina's intimacy, I reacted by dating other girls. We were on the verge of separation many times but somehow made up. I tried desperately to resolve our problems since, when I still was very close to Nina, I made anti-regime remarks on several occasions and even planned a joint escape from the USSR. I was afraid to aggravate her too much in order not to push her into possibly reporting me to the militia. However, for some reason Nina did not want to break off with me completely, and one day announced that she was expecting a child and wanted to legalize our marriage. Since, I did not consider myself the father of the child and fearing black-mail by Nina, I decided to speed up my defection which I was planning anyway.

20. TRAVEL:

None except as described previously.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

21. HISTORY OF ARRESTS:

In June 1962, I was approached by the rayon militia at my place of work and was taken to the militia offices where I was accused of being a long standing member of a Georgian resistance group and of making anti-government statements. Although I had actually made such remarks on occasions and was therefore guilty of the latter charge, I noticed that the militia did not have sufficient information on this subject and I denied all accusations. I could not figure out who was behind the report. After prolonged interrogation, during which I was extensively questioned on my biography, parents, army service, contacts, etc., I was released with the warning that I was not to leave the area for the time being and that I would be contacted in the near future by the militia. Except for this case, I was never arrested or detained by militia or security organs.

22. MEMBERSHIP IN POLITICAL PARTIES OR ORGANIZATIONS:

I never belonged to the Communist Party. I was urged to join the Komsomol in 1937 while at the Tbilisi Elektro-Technicum, and was sponsored there by two of my class-mates, each of whom had more than two years of Komsomol standing. I submitted the application to the local Komsomol yacheyka (cell) and at a general meeting of the cell members mý application was discussed and I told my life story and answered questions put to me by the members. After I was accepted, I received my membership card in about two months from the city rayon committee of the Komsomol in Tbilisi after which I had to attend meetings and pay very small dues. I never held any official position with the Komsomol organization. When I left Tbilisi, I had to deregister from the Tbilisi organization and register with the local organization at my new place of residence in Mikha Tskhakaya (usually referred to by the local population simply as 'Tskhakaya'). The same proceedure had to be repeated upon my departure to and discharge from the army (deregistration from the old organization and registration at the new place). Upon my return from the army to Tskhakaya, I never registered with the local organization again.

When I started to work in Tskhakaya, I was automatically enrolled in the prof-soyuz (trade unions) where I was a passive member paying my dues (something like 1% of my salary) to the trade union organizer of MTS (prof-org) and attending the obligatory meetings from time to time. I never took any advantage of trade union members privileges such as the cut-rate accommodations in rest homes (putevka v dom otdykha).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

23. CONNECTIONS WITH ANY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES:

I never had any contacts with intelligence services. I was never approached to serve in any capacity for Soviet security organs.

24. DEFECTION AND ESCAPE:

A. MOTIVATION:

In spite of being born and raised in a Communist country, I, at an early age began to understand that real freedom did not exist for the individual. It was also clear to me that personal advancement did not depend on talent and integrity but on the degree of one's political activity. I analyzed the Communist lies seeing reality so different from the official propoganda. During and after the war, I met people who visited Western countries and was able to benefit from the particles of truth about a different life there from the even sometimes very carefully worded reports of those people. After I purchased a good radio of 'Mir' make in 1956, I started to listen intensively to foreign broadcasts. For a long time I cultivated the idea of eventual escape from the USSR where I had no relatives, no family, no possibilities for advancement and a decent life. My anti-government sentiments which developed as time passed became stronger and stronger, and it became more and more difficult for me to hold myself back and not to express them openly, which I did anyway on several occasions. My involvment with the militia and the unfavorable developments in my personal life accelerated my plans for defection.

B. TECHNIQUES OF ESCAPE:

On 25 June 1962, three days after my experience with the militia, I left my residence at 0700 as I normally would to go to work. I walked out of town toward Samtredia. I wore my regular clothing, had 80 rubles and a small hand bag. I did not want to take the train being afraid of militia surveillance. After I walked two or three kilo- meters on the highway, I got a ride on a truck from a near-by collective farm which was headed in the same direction. I got off the truck downtown in Samtredia and paid the driver one ruble, then walked toward the railroad station. Here I purchased the ticket for Batumi and boarded the train at 1150 arriving in Batumi at 1415.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 119

-12-

found a safe place and slept until dark. I started off on foot from Batumi and followed the sea shore until I reached the old shooting range about 1 1/2 or 2 km to the south. Here I entered the water at about 2200 hours, after destroying my passport (the rest of my documents were left at home) and burying my clothing and bag. I knew from previous study of a map at home that I had to swim some 18 km. to Turkish territory. I swam all night and was not sure if I had reached Turkish soil, but being exhausted, I came ashore at about 0300 or 0400 hours. The point where I stepped out was on the gradient of a steep slope. There I saw the silhouette of a hut and went in. There was an old discarded electric motor in the hut. From the Russian description on the motor, I understood that I was still in Russia. I hid in the underbrush near-by and spent the rest of the night and the following day there. When it was getting dark, I climbed the slope to observe the area. I walked for a while hearing voices in Russian coming from the shore. I saw a dark object on the sea which resembled a submarine. I continued walking near the shore and around 2200 or 2300 hours I entered the water and started to swim 3 km off shore and then parallel to it. When I came into the range of a search light which swept the sea, I submerged. When I came to the surface the search light swept over me but nothing happened and I knew I had not been discovered. I continued to swim until I was completely exhausted, and several hours before dawn went ashore and hid in a cave opposite two big rocks in the sea near the shore. I remained there until morning. The next morning I climbed up the slope where I saw a stone structure resembling a grave. I went in and observed the land around me from a small opening. I saw a large village which I later learned was Kemal-Pasha. I thought at first that a minaret was an observation tower. I also presumed that this was the village of Sarpi, still on Soviet territory. I was very thirsty and climbed down the hill to a near-by stream to drink water. I met an 11 or 12 year old boy whom I addressed in Russian but the boy drew away from me. Being still not sure as to where I was, I walked in the stream for a while to hide my footprints. Then I hid in the underbrush until it grew dark. I came out and went around the village to its opposite end. There I entered the town and knocked on the door of a house situated on a hillside. I called out in Russian. Even though I heard voices and footsteps in the house nobody opened the door. I climbed on the roof of a sort of stable in the courtyard and spent the night there. Early next morning I was awakened by


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 120

-13-

noises in the courtyard. I saw several women and two
men: I approached them and tried to make them under-
stand by sign language that I had come from Russia.
Meanwhile, some persons carrying sticks and axes came
into the courtyard. I again tried to explain that I came
from Russia and wanted to remain in Turkey. The men
took me to the military authorities in Kemal-Pasha.

When I dived into the sea in Batumi, I was wearing swimming
trunks, a belt and a pair of fins. There was a clasp
knife in my belt, a sack needle for stinging myself in
case of a cramp, my money in a nylon bag, three bars of
chocolate, a compass and two Phenamin tablets to increase
my energy in a separate nylon bag. Except for the
occasional search light in the sea, which I avoided by
diving, I did not encounter any other obstacles on my way.

I did not inform anybody about my escape plans and did not
receive any help from anybody.

From Kemal-Pasha where I was given some clothing, I was
taken by car to Erzerum and from there by train to
Istanbul refugee center. I was there about a week and
was taken to Germany with the assistance of US authorities
on Friday 6 July 1962.

25 DOCUMENTS:

A. PASSPORT:

I received my first three-year passport at #17 militia
(passport desk) office of Molotovskiy rayon of Tbilisi,
where I resided at that time. The passport was a single
sheet of paper with my photo and biographic data on it.
In 1939 I exchanged it for a new five-year passport at
the Mikha Tskhakaya rayon militia. This passport was of
a regular booklet form and along with my photo and bio
data, had a stamp of propiska (registration with militia)
which stated the date of my arrival in this town and my
residence address. Then I was drafted to the army, I
turned in my passport and military booklet to the
rayvoyenkomat, and picked it up upon discharge from the
service. At that time I received a new five-year passport
from the same militia office with the propiska showing
my new address. In 1951, I exchanged my passport for the
new one which was valid for 10 years and which was
exchanged for another 10-year passport in 1961.

B. MILITARY BOOKLET (Toyennyy Bilet):
See paragraph 18. In the army I had a service booklet
(sluzhebnaya knizhka) which I turned in to my rayon
voyenkomat upon return from the army.

C. LABOR BOOKLET (Trudovaya Knizhka):
I never possessed one since it was issued by one employer
and turned into the new employer when an individual
changed employment. I never changed jobs

COMMENTS:

CO visited Subj at his apartment and learned that though the German firm in Dusseldorf is interested in his invention, it nevertheless he's not committed itself and he iron to study it while. Subject indicated to CO that he has no intentions to wait until the Germans make up their minds. He was obviously discouraged by his inability to sell his invention and realization he is no longer needed by CONCO.

As the result of the above he commented that he is now anxious to go to South America or to any country where we can assist him in legalizing. He even stated that since he has no funds from the sale of his invention he is not anxious to return to the Congo and say goodbye to his friends. He stated several times previously that the only reason he could return would be to see to take care of, and that he could handle the personal matters there A.M. and will.

CO informed him that he would inform Washington that subject is now ready and anxious to go to America. Subj then brought up the fact that the Dusseldorf firm which he visited were very interested in taking advantage of his Congo background and send him there as a business representative. He would first he would go strictly as a private individual servior- for a business firm, but that his status would change or emerge to since the the Human Government
of the first activity in the Congo. He stated that he has no real desire to return to the Congo for German firm since such a position is available for us. He would therefore rather go to a place of our choosing and be available any time he was asked to serve by Uncle Sam. He commented however that in the event we delay his leaving Germany unduly (in his estimation) he may be to forced to take the offer cute by the German firm. He made it clear that he did not mean this as a threat, but straight resettlement fact since by taking the job in the Congo he would at least have a job, whereas by going to South America me has no job in sight.

Memo to the File

On 26 June 62 Subj called and said that he had come to Dusseldorf on 22 June and is returning there for further discussions on his invention on 27 June. He stated that the people there are interested in his invention and he hoped that xxxxxx something could soon be worked out.

He commented further that the person he brought the letter to (letter of introduction mentioned in previous reports) is with a German firm which is interested in the Congo and in contact with Congolese officials

Subj will call CO upon his return to Frankfurt on 27 June 62.

Subj stated that the firm in Dortmund was not interested in his intention stating that they would have to sell it so cheaply they could not make any money on it.

Subj asked if there was anything new. CO informed him that the ways of Hqs are often strange to understand but that there is evidence that something is being done since a telegram was received inquiring whether or not he had any preference as to where he may prefer to localize in South America. He stated that he did not care where he lived, the important thing being that he would like to work for us anywhere in the world. He even mentioned Loss where he claimed he could be of some use.

CO informed Subj that for future planning he would like to know that in the event we would assist him in legalizing in S. America, but informed he that he would no longer have a job with us, whether he could get along on his own. He stated that though this would make him unhappy he would naturally have to make the best arrangements possible.

He was told that there was nothing else to tell, that now we could only wait to get an answer with their suggestions. He was offered his old Austrian passport and identity papers so he could go to Geneva and Brussels to finish his assignment for the Congolese Defense Ministry. Subject said he was in no hurry to do this and therefore refused the passport, stating that he was hoping to hear from Dortmund regarding his invention within the next two weeks and this assignment he had to do could be done on his way back to Leopoldville. It is obvious that Subject's primary worry or concern is to get a job with us. Subject asked if his identity card could be renewed. Case Officer took the card and had it re-validated until 24 June and returned it to Subject.

Subject was also told that the cook would be taken from him for several weeks and that Case Officer would give him 100 DM to eat on. Subject was quite surprised and pleased.

Subject suggested that we investigate the possibility of his immigrating to Australia, Canada, England, etc. Case Officer said that his chances were nil, that the entrance requirements to these countries were extremely difficult to satisfy and that his best bet is probably South America.

![signature of David E.] David E.

Case Officer and introduced as Mr. Joseph LORTON, went to see Subject with the express purpose of discussing the various possibilities that might be available to document Subject as legally as possible.

Subject told CO that he had made contact in Dortmund under the name of de Panaskhet, whith a firm that was interested in his invention. They told him that since he did not have a patent this would pose a problem and offered him 5,000 DM for his idea. Subject told them he would give it to them outright for $10,000. Although they did not refuse his request, they told him they would think it over and discuss it with the boss and would have to make a patent search which would take up to 4 weeks. Subject told them to go ahead but not to try to pull any funny business since there were ways of proving that the idea was his and he could offer it to other firms. Subject will now wait to be contacted by this firm.

Case Officer told Subject that we had not heard anything from Headquarters regarding his re-employment by us. He asked if there was some way of finding out approximately how long it would take. CO told him this was very difficult, but we would see if we could make an educated guess.

Subject asked for a key to the mailbox since he will be receiving mail from his friends in Dortmund and possibly from the firm which he has contacted.

then began discussing documentation with Subject along the following lines:

The type of documentation he would receive if any would depend upon the final decision from Headquarters as yes not received. We solicited suggestions from Subject as to solutions to the documentation problem. Apparently his immediate desire is to receive back his Austrian pass, finish his business in Europe and return to the Congo to clean up matters there.

The other for long range alternative would be, he would like to have especially if he is not employed by KUBARK documentation of a legal nature in the ramc of David de Panaskhet with which he could surface anywhere in the world and take up legal residence. He himself suggested the possibility of our agency determining some South American country where suitable britertes are possible. He could acquire citizenship in a short period of time, if possible without his personal appearance there and acquire a passport from that country. Obviously this would mean finding some country where bribery would affect quick acqusition of citizenship and passport. He did not express any particular eagerness to accept German documentation unless he could get a Reiseausweis. We discussed the relative merits of a Fremdenpass and a Reiseausweis. We told him that if we could obtain a Fremdenpass with a minimum of change in his true life story, but the acquisition of a Reiseausweis would mean telling a big lie, which he personally took a dim view, but said he would do it if necessary. We said we thought we could get him a Fremdenpass without too much difficulty from controlled authorities but the effect of control and security of this passport would be limited to the time he remained registered at the place from which the Fremdenpass was issued. Therefore, the issuance of a Fremdenpass might well be a short range solution only unless he could obtain an immigration visa to the desired country of resettlement without a six-month period. In any event, the decision to obtain a Premdenpass would rest on the decision made ty Headquarters as to the final disposition of his case. In the event a Fremdenpass was to be obtained Subject was requested to sign all necessary forms and submit all necessary information for the completion of these forms, which he did. He was reassured again that no steps will be made to acquire a Fremdenpass without prior consultation with him.

COMMENTS:

LACKLEN introduced DARONNAT as Mr. Murmann and explained that he would now be working with Subject. On the way to lunch DARONNAT explained that he and Subject would be working together to resolve whatever problems Subject might have. During lunch, conversation was limited mostly to Subject's views on the Congo situation and the solutions. He also expounded at great lengths on the of the Congolestand the Belgians whom he would appear to dislike intensely.

Upon return to the apartment Subject was told that we would like to get him West German documentation with political recognition. He was told that if we are successful he would be documented as legally as possible under the circumstances and would be in a position to begin a new life. Subject was very pleased but a bit skeptical that we could accomplish this. He was asked to think carefully about his desire to use the name David de Panaskhet since, if he was wanted for breaking parole in France, there could be a watch list for that name and it could be assumed that since Panaskhet was his brother's name, Subject might assume that name some day. Subject stated that someone was confused about his status in France, that he was not on parol and had, therefore, not done anything wrong in leaving the country. He said that the worst that could happen if he returned there would be for the authorities to ask him why he had left the town he had been confined to. His answer would be that since they had restricted his movements he had left the country (C. O. doubts that this is true but world not raise any questions).

Subject was given a DRC identity card, number 596, in the name of David de Panaskhet. Since HARVARD is awaiting Headquarters proposa regarding Subject's resettlement, C. O. suggested that he investigate the possibility of marketing his telephone answering device.

The man he proposed to visit in Dusseldorf to whom he had a letter of introduction, would have to be told his name is Reiner.

1. As requested by AD/FI, LACKLEN met WITROGUE as scheduled in the CABSCONE apartment at 1000 hours on 23 May 1962. Roscoe H. HOSIEN accompanied to witness the meeting and assist later if necessary, in reconstruction of needed facts.

2. LACKLEN told WIROGUE that he had sent a message to Washington with the highlights of the 22 May meeting. He said that this message probably could not be acted upon prior to 23 May due to the time difference between Washington and Frankfurt. He was advised that while we hope for some word today it was more probable we would not get an answer prior to 24 May. WIROGUE said that he understood the time delays in awaiting replies from Washington and expressed his satisfaction with our efforts to assist him.

3. LACKLEN told him the documents which he had loaned us were being photographed and would be returned to him as soon as possible. WIROGUE said he was in no hurry for his documents and for us to keep them as long as we needed them. He said he hated being coupled up in this apartment and hoped that we could give him an interim pass which would permit him to go out on the street in Frankfurt. LACKLEN said that he was trying to obtain this pass as soon as possible, the photo WIROGUE gave 22 May was not proper with the sport shirt and that he would have HOSIEN take more pictures the afternoon of 23 May with coat and tie for the pass. LACKLEN explained that the delay in issuing the pass was simply getting another operational activity to release one of their cover passes for WIROGUE. LACKLEN assured him that we were moving as rapidly as possible and would make every effort to have a pass for him by 1700 23 May. LACKLEN said if this was not possible he would phone him at 1700 and probably have the pass the following morning, the morning of 24 May. WIROGUE agreed.

4. WIROGUE said that he wanted to travel to Dortmund and Dusseldorf to talk to people there about his telephone answering device. He would like to have a pass to facilitate this trip which would take two or three days. LACKLEN suggested WIROGUE "sit tight" until we had some information from Washington before making this trip. In this exchange of conversation WIROGUE mentioned that he preferred not to use his Austrian passport in Germany. LACKLEN took this entree and asked WIROGUE why didn't he get a real passport as it obvious WIROGUE felt the Austrian passport was reaching the end of its usefulness. WIROGUE said he wanted more than anything else to legalize himself in any country, even the Congo. He said that he knew US citizenship was impossible because of his criminal record. LACKLEN asked him if he had ever considered German citizenship. (NOTE: In the discussion of a permanent recognition document, LACKLEN deliberately confused the terms economic recognition, citizenship, political recognition, etc.) WIROGUE was not willing to spend the required five years residency in Germany to attain citizenship or for that matter in any other country. LACKLEN mentioned that some German documentation might be obtainable, however, he knew


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

nothing about this. LACKLEN said that certainly with the large numbers
of refugees that have come to West Germany in the past 15 years, there
must be some means of getting documentation. LACKLEH said if WIROGUE
would officially ask him for German recognition that he would forvard
this request to Washington. LACKLEN made it very clear that we here in
Germany could make no commitments, could do nothing on this matter or make
another move on this case until we hear from Washington. WIROGUE said
he clearly understood this and asked for German documentation in exchange
for his Austrian passport, etc.

5. Later in the conversation WIROGUE mentioned he had a moral obligation
   to carry out his assignment for the Congolese army here in Europe and
   said he must give them some information bymaid withing three weeks. LACKLEN
   asked WIROGUE how would a German recognition affect his dealing with the
   Congolese army. WIROGUE said he mus he must return to the Congo for two or three
   days to conclude his contract with them. He would require his Austrian
   passport for this.

6. Throughout the conversation KIROGUE used the words, if the
   service does not have anything for me." It is LACKLEN's opinion that
   WIROGUR believes it quite possible that KUBARK may not have an assignment
   for him and that if we can provide him with usable recognition documentation
   he might be effectively terminated. The one problem still unclear, however,
   is how to obtain his agreement not to return to the Congo. The matter that
   we retain his Austrian passport will prevent him from returning to the Congo,
   but it will be very desirable to find a plausible reason by which we can
   make him see he must not return to the Congo.

7. LAEKLEN requested and WIROGUE agreed to remain in the a apartment
   until the pass could be obtained. LACKLEN arranged for a maid to come in
   and cook his meals. French magazines were provided. It is believed he will
   be content in the apartment through 24 May.

8. Throughout the meeting WIROGUE continually zostotaka expressed
   his views on the Congo, documentation procedures and techniques, etc.
   LACKLEN suggested that he had very useful information that might be of
   #interest to an expert in these fields and asked if he would be agreeable
   to takking with someone. WIROGUE said he would be very pleased to do so.
   LACKLEN made this pitch as a contingency by which we might tie up WIROGUE
   for several days in "important" debriefings and delay ex his pressing
   for an immediate solution. We might also describe delays as being caused
   by Washington has nowar barcaney, somathing of which he claims to be very
   familiar with. During these debriefings it would be possible also to learn
   the extent fo his knowlegeability of KUBARK operations, personalities, ets.
   LACKLEN believes WIROGUE has quite an extensive knowledge of KUBARK. He
   has been handled by many people, in many places and in many ways.

9. Coucerning WIROGUE's request that we ask Washington approval to explore the possibility of obtaining German recognition for him, he requested that if documentation could be obtained he would like it in the name of "David De Punaskhot". He said this was his brother's legal name in France. WIROGUE suggested also that the document include that he was also know previously as "David Teitzichvili" which is his real and true name from birth.

10. WIROGUE continued to show a complete satisfaction and contentment with our handling of his case so far. LACKLEN reiterated that we vere "rolling along" as es rapidly as possible and would make every effort to get an early reply from Washington. To further "substantiate" our desired to give him every assistance, LACKLEN offered to furnish him with the addresses of the Telefunken, Grundig and other electric factories in West Germany where he might sell his invention. WIROGUE said he would appreciate this, but that he also had letters of introduction to several firms in Dortmund and Dusseldorf. At the conclusion of the meeting, LACKLEN summed up the timetable for action as follovi

a. MOSIEN would return at about 1400 today to take needed pass photos and bring him some French reading material. WIREAK WIROGUE agreed to remain in the apartment until such a pass was available. LACKIEN would do his best to get it by 1700 today, but if not, early on 24 May.

b. When a pass vas available WIROGUE could work out arrangements to go to Rockmonk Dortmund, etc., however, it may be that his debriefing on the Congo, on documentation, etc. was of sufficient importance that he should be devriefed immediately.

c. To make his stay in the apartment as comfortable as possible he should suggest to the maid the types of foods he particularly enjoys.

d. We would continue to press Washington for authority needed to resolve his case.

11. WIROGUS understood the program and was quite satisfied. He is cooperative and LACKLEN believes will continue to be so as long as a logical and plausible program is presented. LACKLEN's next contact with WIROGUE will be by telephone at 1700 hours on 23 May when he will tell him the pass is not ready and arrange for another contact at 1030 hours on 24 May.

CONTACT REPORT 22 MAY 1962

SUBJECT: WIROGUE

1. WIROGUE phoned Mr. Schneider (HORDWIN) at FC 553001 at 1420 hours 22 May advising that he was at the Frankfurt Main Bahnhof and wished to meet Mr. Schneider. Mr. Schneider requested WIROGUE call back in ten minutes. HORDWIN advised Acting AD/FI that WIROGUE was in Frankfurt and requested what action was desired. Acting AD/FI advised HORDIN to arrange pick up, billet subject in CABEZONE blown apartment and await further instructions. HORDWIN advised WIROGUE when he called back that Mr. Miller (LACKLEN) would meet him at 1500 hours at Track 15, Main Bahnhof. At Acting AD/FI's request LACKLEN first reported to his office to review passport photograph of WIROGUE and get further instructions. Acting AD/FI instructed LACKLEN to take him to the apartment and if feasible, obtain the passport and with extreme caution elicit any information regarding WIROGUE's purpose for coming to Frankfurt. DOOS came through the office at this time and was advised that LACKLEN and CABEZONE were carrying out this task.

2. WIROGUE was met as planned. He advised that he had already checked into the Hotel Savoy across the street. LACKLEN believed it most feasible to obtain the passport if he were in a CABEZONE apartment. If he were in the hotel, he may be reluctant to give up the passport, etc. WIROGUE was concerned at first about burdening us by living in our apartment but agreed to do so. Stephen R. LACKLEN using alias Mr. Edward Miller and Roscoe MOSIEN using alias Mr. Dale drove subject in CABEZONE car to #1 Ostend Strasse, apartment 9. This nice one-bedroom apartment with kitchen and bath and a living room is regarded as blown and is scheduled to be dropped in Fiscal 1963. The telephone number there is 492813. Contact instructions given WIROGUE in a FRAN cable were Mr. Schneider's number FC 553001 (ops phone located in HORDIN's office) and the Annex A Guard Post number Northern 8766 for after hours. both of these numbers should be changed as soon as feasible.

3. As soon as WIROGUE was settled in the apartment, LAUXLEN described himself as an administrative officer who was meeting him seeing that he got settled in the new apartment and attending to any of his immediate needs. LACKLEN made it very clear that he had no authority to give him any committments or resolve his case. LCKLEN said, however, that ho would like

to take back to his boss some general informatioranon what WIROGUE wanted in Prankfurt. This lod WIROGUS to begin a los discussion of his problems in the Congo and his desires for a new assignment with the "Service". LACKIEN was trying to build up sufficient rapport by letting hia talk, to find an opening by which he could obtain the passport.xx

A. MIROGUE advised that he had come from Leopoldville to Brussels and was fortunate enough to catch a connecting flight 22 May to Frankfurt. He explained he was in Prankfurt to talk with come old contacts in hopes they might have a Job for him. He asked if Miller (LUCKLEN) knew Mike, LACKI told him no. He said that he had arranged with the Congoleso Minister of Defense to come to Europe to attempt to trace 30,000,000 Princs (sic) - rate 65/1 US Dollar which had been given to the Ministry of Defense officials to purchase airplanes. This money had been deposited in Swiss banks and disappeared. He showed LACKLAN an Crder de Mission dated 17 May 1962 signed by the Secretary General of the Congolese Foreign Ministry identifying him for travel for the Congolese Government to as many countries in Europe as necessary. WIROQUE sounded resolved to complete this mission. He claimed, however, that this aission was simply a cover for his Frankfurt contact with the "Service".

5. WIROGUE talked about himself for about an hour and a a half. Some of the highlights of this ares:

a. About the investigation - a Belgian citizen, who had been in the Congo before independence and who was now a colonel in the Congolese Arity and olose to General Mobutu had gone to the American embassy to "name-check" WIROGUE. WIROQUE said he was not worried about this investigation (NOTE: LACKIEN was not asking these questions, but simply listening to MIROGUE and attempting to lead up to the request for his passport). WIROGUE felt the only way this Belgian eclomel could pin him down was by contacting the Viennese diplomat representative in Leopoldville and through him checking WIROGUE's Austrian passport ausber. He mentioned that his friends in the Surete and Department of Defense Ministry had asked him for a police certificate from Austria. WINOUJE sam no problem in furnishing this. He could fabricate this with no trouble and was confidant it would to accepted because the Congolese officials would have no other such document to compare it with and had a practice of throwing rooma aray.

b. LACKLEN asked WIROGUE what he would like to do, what type of work he was interested in. WIROGUE replied in a 30 minute presentation that he liked outdoor work with military operations like commando work. He liked to work in military uniform or civilian clothes. He hated desk work. LACKLEN asked him if he would like to work in Communist China, Russia, Indochina, or Germany. WIROGUE replied by saying it depended on the job. He wanted a challenge. He said just give me a mission and I'll carry it out. Don't worry about his being arrested, killed or whatever, money was not important. LACKLEN again emphasized that he had no job in mind, but simply was trying to determine what WIROGUE was interested in, what his experience had been, and what he might be qualified to do. LACKLEN said that he would take this information back to his boss, who would have to contact Washington. We here in Frankfurt knew nothing about him and had no file of his experience.

c. LACKLEN asked WIROGUE suppose there is no assignment for you? What would you like to do then? WIROGUE continued discussing his interest in working for the "Service" and indirectly made it clear he was not interested in a normal job and life. LACKLEN asked him what country he was a citizen of. WIROGUE stated that he was stateless. LACKLEN asked him what country he would like to live in if he had his choice, if he could have anything he wanted where would he like to go what would he like to do in a normal life? WIROGUE replied he didn't know, but he hated Germans and gave the impression that he was very content with his present status. At no time was it discussed or did WIROGUE mention employment, entry, or citizenship in the U. S. He also stated he could not go back to France due to some trouble which he then described as the bank robbery.

d. LACKLEN asked him if he was actually receiving a salary from the Congolese Government. He said he was making about 15,000 Congolese Francs per month and this was not enough to live decently on. He said his job in addition to this investigation he was conducting on the embezzlement of money that he was in effect the chief of the Congolese Air Force.

e. WIROGUE described his abilities in demolitions, commando work, liquidations, air operations and navigation and a general knowledge of "spy work". He also said that he was an expert on documentation and that he liked to work making phony documentation, water marks, etc. He also mentioned his telephone answering device which he made for $8.00 and wished to go to Dortmund, West Germany to attempt to market it.

f. During the course of the above conversation WIROGUE showed LACKLEN several documents to substantiate his claims of employment by the Congolese Government, etc. LACKLEN decided that the documentation interest of the "Service" in these Congolese documents would be the best entree to obtain his passport. LACKLEN attempted to display a shallow inflated interest in the water marks and stamps on the documents as an Admin Officer who had had a one week operational course and was really trying to get the documents to impress his boss. With each document LACKLEN commented about their simplicity and easy forging possibilities and how much the documents people would love to get their hands on this. WIROGUE loaned LACKLEN the following documents:

1.  Passport (Austrian) 090058
2.  Return Sabena Air Ticket 8096473 to Leopoldville
3.  Congo Divers Permit
4.  Carte d' Indenitite D'Etranger
5.  Pass from MINDEF/Congo re Technician Status (Civilian)
6.  Health Certificate
7.  Laisses Passer # 71-58. Congo Pass from Leopoldville to Brazzaville
8.  Laissez Passer as Major, Congo Army
9.  UN Pass (access to Royal Hotel, Leopoldville)
10. Congo Certificate of Vaccination
11. Order de Mission (17 May 62) by Secretary General Foreign Ministry
12. Order de Mission to Brazzaville to apprehend a man signed by Joseph MATUBA, 26 March 62
13. Attestation he is Attache (Technician) Congo Army by M. Kalongo, Sec. Gen. Ministry of Defense 28 December 61

6. LACKLEN asked if he could borrow these documents so they could be photographed as he was sure they were of extreme value. LACKLEN said that inasmuch as these documents were WIROGUE's property if he insisted he would have someone photograph the documents tonight and bring them back as fast as possible, but

it would be preferable to have it done on 23 hay during the regular working day. VIROUVE said that he was in no rush for the doauments and please go ahead, take our tire, but he would like to have them back within 48 hours. He then said what would happen if I went out on the street tonight without documents? LACKEN said that he could possibly give him a simple identity card as working with the American Aray here, but requested that WIROGUS stay in the apartment tonight, there was food there and we would bring in anything he wanted, such as magazinos, etc. WIROGUS said that he was tired, that he would take a bath and stay in the apartment. LACKIEN said that he would return at approximately 1000 hours 23 Kay and if WIROGUE had any problems call the emergency number he was given.

7. LACKLEN cbserved as HIROQUE was going through his wallet, attache case and pockets for various documentation ich he thought we would like to photograph, an approximate 9" x 11" inch photostat black copy which identified as his birth certificate. During the course of the conversation, KIROGUE also said that he had a driver's licensa your people gave me with my passport and while mentioning his commission as a major in the Congolese army that he was able to obtain this rank by showing his German Army papers (sic). WINOGUE did not indicate whether these papers were given him or he obtained or made thes himself.

8. Incidentally, WIROQUE indicated he would go into Soviet Russia on his own, accomplish any misalon we wished to assign him and return. All at his own risk, provided we would "belp him". He ales indicated exceptional interest in making phong documents, etc.

LACKLEN did not ask him for these documents since they had apparently been provided by our "Service" and would be inconsistent with at the story of the "Service's" interest in photographing Congolese documents, stamps, eto. It is believed that at the right moment WIROGUE could be taken elsewhere for lunch or some other excuse, that he would probably leave thene documenta in his apartment and we could take possession of them. However, when this is done and he sisses then, the die is cast.

SUBJECTIVE COMMENTS BY LACKLEN

1. LACKLEN feels his approach as a personnel officer representing his boss, trying to get facts which might be helpful in finding out what could be done to help WIROGUE was effective in establishing a proper rapport with him. LACKLEN repeatedly emphasized that he lacked authority, information, etc to make any commitments or be any more than an intermediary to his boss, who himself was an intermediary with Washington. LACKLEN emphasized his "sincere" interest in helping WIROGUE.

2. LACKLEN believes WIROGUE has been very satisfied with his first contact in Frankfurt and will be cooperative until we advise him his passport, etc, will not be returned.

3. WIROGUE impresses LACKLEN as being the man described and possessing the personality and other traits described in the cables. It is believed that he can be a dangerous and difficult individual when "crossed". It is suggested that a clear course of action be established prior to advising WIROGUE his documents are not being returned as it is quite likely WIROGUE has planned or will plan his own course of action.

4. LACKLEN believes that WIROGUE can be delayed for two, three, four, or even more days with the story these documents, the stamps are terrific, "our people" are really excited about them and we would like to keep them longer, we would like to send them to Washington, etc. It may be that WIROGUE could be given an identification card similar to but not identical with as those provided defectors describing the individual as in Army custody as an interim measure and clearly marked with an expiration date.

5. It may be important to note that prior to meeting WIROGUE LACKLEN had only read FRAN 0404 and made a 30 second perusal of LEOP 3939 and DIR 11783. LACKLEN did really not retain any data from the two incoming messages and certifies that he did not lead WIROGUE in the conversation but simply let him talk with as the purpose of establishing rapport and obtaining the passport if possible.

6. At approximately 1755 hours LACKLEN returned to the DCOS's office and briefed the DCOS and Acting AD/FI on the meeting. Acting AD/FI sent an Ops immediate cable to LEOP DIR and routine toR FROB. A meeting was scheduled in the AD/FI office at 0830 23 May. Acting AD/FI's request LACKLEN notified Deputy Chief MKTOPAZ to attend the meeting. Aziz Deputy Chief MKTOPAZ came to CABEZONE at 1945 hours 22 May and inspected documents. Stephen P. Lacklen

Weltkrieg gefallen war. Sie lebte mit einer Tochter, die währendessen geboren worden war, in einer bescheidenen Wohnung die sie von ihrem Mann geerbt hatte. Ihre Eltern waren tot und sie arbeitete als Briefträgerin da sie nur eine bescheidene Ausbildung genossen hatte. Während der letzten Jahre unseres. Zusammenlebens fand ich heraus, dass Nina Beziehungen zu anderen Männern unterhielt. Das war der Anlass zu Streitigkeiten und das Zusammenleben wurde unerträglich. Dann erwartete sie ein Kind und da ich sicher war, dass es nicht mein Kind war, entschloss ich mich unsere Beziehungen zu beenden. Das war mit ein Grund für meine Flucht. Ich habe keine eigenen Kinder.

1927-1934- Trudowaja Schkola Nr. 107 ( 10- Jahre Schule, desyatiletka) die sich an der Ecke von Prospekt Michailow - skiy und Kirochnaja Ulitsa in Tbilisi befand. (Zur Zeit heissen die Strassen PLECHANOVA und MARDSHANISCHWILI).

Vor 1927 war es das deutsche Realgymnasium und obwohl es in eine srednjaja schkola umgewandelt worden war wurde der Unterricht bis 1930 in Deutsch abgehalten und erst von diesem Jahr an in der georgischen Sprache. Die Mehrzahl der Schüler waren Georgier. Bis 1930 gab es zwei Stunden in der Woche russischen Sprachunterricht und eine Stunde georgischen Sprachunterricht. Ich war sieben Jahre in dieser Schule aber wegen des Todes meiner Mutter wechselte ich auf die technische Schule über da ich dort wohnen konnte und verpflegt wurde.

Sommer 1934 suchte ich um Aufnahme in dieser Schule an und überreichte das Schulzeugnis der sieben absolvierten Jahre und ein Photo. Im Juli oder August bestand ich die Aufnahmeprüfung über Mathematik, Physik und schriftliche und mündliche Priffungen in georgischer und russischer Sprache. Als mein Name auf der Aushängetafel der Schule aufschien wusste ich, dass ich bestanden hatte. Ich musste kein Schulgeld bezahlen und bekam ein Stipendium welches gerade alles lebensnotwendige deckte. Der Aufenthalt im Schulheim, wo ich ein Zimmer mit drei anderen Studenten teilte, war frei. Im ersten Stock des Technikums, in der Nähe des Schulbüros, war ein Speisesaal wo man billig essen konnte. Das Essen war schlecht. Die weiblichen Studenten lebten in etrem Nebengebäude in derselben Strasse, zwei oder drei Häuserblocks vom Technikum.

Vier Jahre studierte ich Physik, Mathematik, Geschichte, Englisch, georgische Sprache und Literatur; von 1936 oder 1937 an die Verfassung der Sowjet Union. Die Gegenstände wurden auf dem Stand einer"Höheren Schule" gelehrt. Dann gab es noch die folgenden spezialen Unterrichtsgegenstände: Technologie der Metalle, Theorie der Mechanik, Materialstärke, Elektro-Maschinen, elektrische Arbeitsverfahren, Elektro-Geräte, elektrische Messinstrumente, Zeichnen. Die Studenten wurden auch militärisch ausgebildet und körperlich ertüchtigt. Der Unterricht dauerte von September bis Juli. Die Sommerferien verbrachte ich gewöhnlich auf einem Kolchos mit einer Gruppe, die vom Technikum organisiert worden war, um den Bauern mit der Ernte zu helfen.

Die Prüfungen fanden zwei mal im Jahre statt, vor dem Jahresende und am Ende eines zweiten Semesters. Noten wurden nach dem folgenden Systen gegeben:

1 - Otschen plocho (sehr schlect)

Die ersten drei Noten waren notwendig um versetzt zu werden.

Im Frühling 1938 hatte ich Abschlussprüfungen, mundlich und schriftlich und ich bekam ein Diplom ausgehändigt. Das Zeugnis war eine Seite lang und brachte zum Ausdruck, dass ich das Technikum 4 Jahre lang besucht hatte. Es enthielt die Noten für alle Gegenstände und zeigte, dass ich als electro-mechanic ausgebildet worden war.

Allen Prüflingen wurden verschiedene Arbeitsplätze zugewiesen an denen sie mindestens zwei Jahre zu verbleiben hatten. Das ist eine Art von Rückzahlung des Geldes, das die Regierung für die Ausbildung ausgegeben hatte. Ich wurde MICHA-ZCHAKAJA M.T.S. zugewiesen; der Name wurde 1958 in R.T.S. abgewandelt.

17. BERUFLICHER WERDEGANG:

1938-1941. und 1946-bis zur Flucht MICHA ZCHAKAJA MIT.S. (Maschinen-Traktoren-Station), später abgewandelt in R.T.S. (Reparatur-Technische-Station) . ( Matchino-Traktornaja und bzw. Remontno- Technitscheskaja Stanzija). MICHA-ZCHAKAJA wurde von der Bevölkerung einfach Zchakaja genannt und war Rayon-Zentrum des Zchakajskii Rayon, so genannt nach dem berühmten georgischen Revolutionär MICHA ZCHAKAJA (( der alte Name der Stadt war ACHAL -SENAKI bezw. ACHAL SENAKSKII Rayon ). M. Zchakaja war einer der Organisatoren der georgischen kommunistischen Partei.

Die Stadt hat gegenwärtig ungefähr 10.000 Einwohner und be-
findet sich an der Eisenbahnstrecke Samtredia-Suchumi (die
Hauptstrecke zwischen Tbilisi und Moskau mit Abzweigungen nach
Poti, dem Badeort am Schwarzen Meer. Die Stadt liegt zwischen
zwei Zuflüssen des Rion Flusses: Tsivi und Terachi. Am Letzteren
liegt ein paar Kilometer von M. ZCHAKAJA entfernt ein kleines
Elektrizitätswerk wo ich nach meiner Ruckkehr aus dem II. Welt-
krieg zeitweilig arbeitete. Bei K.T.S. ( welche 1958 in R.T.S.
umbenannt wurde nachdem die Einrichtungen und Maschinen den
lokalen Getreide-und Trauben- erzeugenden Kolchosen zugeteilt
worden waren und als einzige Verantwortung die Reparatur die-
ser Maschinen mit R.T.S. verblieb ). Ich wurde bald Vorarbeiter
einer Gruppe von Elektro-Mechanikern, die für die Pflege und
die Reparaturen der elektrischen Teile von landwirtschaftlichen
und anderen Maschinen verantwortlich waren. Mein Anfangsgehalt
war 400 oder 500 Rubel, aberes stieg schnell und als ich in die
Armee einberufen wurde war mein Gehalt schon fast doppelt so
hoch.

Aus persönlichen Gründen kehrte ich in diese Stadt zurück, nach
dem ich aus dem Militärdienst entlassen worden war und ich er-
hielt meine alte Stellung wieder. Ich bekam dazu noch eine
Stelle als Elektro-Techniker mit den vorher erwähnten Elektri-
zitätswerk, welches Elektrizität für die Stadt und dem übrigen
Rayon erzeugte. Ich erhielt diese Stelle zugewiesen, da nach
dem Krieg ein kangel an qualifizierten Arbeitskräften bestand.
Ich arbeitete in der zweiten Schicht im Elektrizitätswerk von
1947-1953 (dann wurde die Stelle von einem jungen Absolventen
des Kutaisi Technikums gefüllt). Ich verdiente dort 700 Rubel
neben meinem Grundgehalt bei RT.S. Vor meiner Flucht war mein
Einkommen ungefähr 120 neue Rubel Brutto. Ich hatte susätzliches
Einkommen von Wochenend-Arbeiten für die Reparatur von Haushalt
gegenständen, Radios usw. durch Einwohrer der Stadt. Das Geld war
1961 10 zu 1 abgewertet worden.

18. MILITARISCHER WERDEGANG

## A. REGISTRIERUNG FÜR MILITÄRDIENST:

Im Sommer 1939 wurde ich von meinem rayon-wojenkomat ( Rekrutierungsstelle) benachrichtigt, dass ich mich an einem bestimmten Tag dort einzufinden habe; von dort ging es mit einer Gruppe anderer zukünftiger Rekruten zu der rayon polyclinic für die medizinische Untersuchung. Ich habe den linken Daumen und Zeigefinger bis zum ersten Glied durch einen Arbeitsunfall verloren und als dies der Rekrutierungsstelle mitgeteilt wurde, wurde ich für den aktiven Dienst als ungeeignet erklärt und der Reserve zugewiesen. Zu demselben Zeitpunkt wurde mein pripisnoje swidetelstwo ( Registrierungs-Dokument) für ein Soldbuch ausgetauscht.

## B. EINZIEHUNGSTAG:

Ungefähr am 26 August 1941 wurde ich aufgefordert mich am 27. August beim raywojenkomat zu melden. Ich tat das und wurde aufgefordert mich zum Dienst am folgenden Tag zu melden. Mit einer Gruppe von ungefähr 80 bis 100 Rekruten meines Rayons fuhren mir mit dem Zug von Tbilisi nach Baku, wo die Gruppe in der sogenannten Saljanskije Kasarmi ( S. Kaserne ) untergebracht wurde, die sich am Stadtrand von Baku, auf der Strasse nach Saljani und zür iranischen Grenze, befand.

## C. militärische EINHEIT und ERKENNUNGSNUMMER:

Ich diente bei der Luftabwehr Artillerie. Eine Erkennungsnummer hat es bei der sowjetischen Armee nicht gegeben.

## D. GRUNDAUSBILDUNG:

Meine erste militärische Ausbildung erhielt ich in der Saljani Kaserne in Baku und sie dauerte zwei Monate. Einen Monat reguläre Grundausbildung und im zweiten Monat verbesserte ich meine Qualifikation als Autofahrer ( Ich hatte gelernt wie man einen Wagen fährt während ich in der M.T.S. die elektrischen Reparaturen


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

- 10 -

an Autos durchführte. Ich weiss die Nimmer er Finheit
nicht mehr in der ich meine Grundausbildung erhielt. Zu
diesem Zeitpunkt waren die Kasernen überfällt, meistens
Soloisten der Infantrie und Artillerie die inner wieder
abgelöst wurden.

E. SPEZIALAUSBILDUNG: Einen Monat Fahrschule wie oben
erwähnt.

F. RESERVE ZUGEHÖRIGKSIT:

Sommer 1939: Aus Gesundheitsgründen untauglich
für aktiven Dierst und der Reserve
zugeteilt.

Herbst 1946: Aus der Armee entlassen-nachdem
ich meine Reise und Entlassungs-
papiere meinem-Eajwojenkomat über-
gegeben hatte erhielt ich ein neues
Soldbuch welches meine Reserve Zu-
gehörigkeit enthielt. Ich wurde nie
mehr einberufen oder zu irgendeiner
Übung eingezogen nachdem ich von
meinem Militärdienst entlassen
worden war.

G. CHRONOLOGISCHE AUFZEICHNUNG MEINES MILITIRDIENSTES:
Mit einer Gruppe anderer Rekruten wurde ich mit dem Zug zu
der 253. Separaten Luftabwehr Artillerie Division, 2. Batterie,
gebracht (OSAD- ogne-saschtschitnyi artilleriski division ).
Der kormandierende Offizier der Batterie war Leutnant WAKS.
Kommandant der wswod uprawlerije ( Verwaltung, Zugsführer )
der Division war Leutnant ENDELADSE. Stellvertretender Divi-
sionskommandant für politische Belange war Hauptmann TSCHOCHA
und politruk meiner Batterie war Senior Leutnant SAMARIN.
Major Wiado ( Wladimir) GURGENIDSE war kommandierender Offizier
von OSAD und im Februar 1943 wurde er auch zum Commandeur von


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 153

- 11 -

PWO (protiwo- wosdischnaja oborona) ( Luftschutz) für die
Stadt Michurinsk ernannt. Das Hauptquartier der Division war
in Michurinsk, während die Batterie in der Nähe der Station
TARASOWO bei der Siedlung Konskoje, 7 km von Kichurinsk und
6 km von den 6 errichteten Gehegen bei Kochetora ( Station)
lag. Ein höhes Hauptquartier war in Tanbow und wurde erst von
Oberst TSCHERNJAFIZI und später von Oberst ZECZOW, einem de-
gradierten General komandiert.

Als ich zuerst in Michurinsk eintraf wurde ich erst als Last-
wagenfahrer dem Verpflegungszug der Division zigeteilt (chos-
wswod oder chosjajstwennyi wswod), kommandiert von Junior
Leutnant MAKAROW. Später wurde ich mit dem oben erwähnten
ENDELADSE bekannt, ein Landsmann von mir und wurde durch sei-
nen Einfluss den Divisions-Kommandeur GURGENIDSE, auch ein
Georgier der später zum Oberstleutnant befördert wurde, als
persönlicher Fahrer zugeteilt. Er behielt mich in dieser Po-
sition bis ich vom Militärdienst entlassen wurde.

H. BEFÖRDERUNGEN UND DEGRADIERUNGEN: Nach 6 Monaten Mili-
tärzeit wurde ich zum jefrejtor ( Gefreiten ) befördert, am
Ende des ersten Jahres zum Unterfeldwebel und 1944 wurde ich
zum Feldwebel befördert

Iv AUSZEICHNUNGEN: keine

J. ENTLASSUNGSTAG: Ich wurde vom aktiven Militärdienst
Ende September 1946 entlassen. Ich erhielt meinen Pahrbefehl
und Reisegeld von meiner Einheit in Michurinsk, die ich spä-
ter dem rajwojenkomat übergab. 1955 wurde ich nochmals ärzt-
lich untersucht, auf Befehl vom vojenkomat und offiziell aus
meiner Reservestellung entlassen, aus Gesundheitsgründen (so
wie zuvor) und erhielt eine sogenannte belji bilet ( weisse


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

Karte) oder dauernde Befreiung vom Militärdienst.

19. WOHNORTE SEIT GEBURT:

1919-1926 verschiedene Adressen in Tbilisi

1926-1934 Tbilisi, Kirotschnaja Ulitsa Nr. 35
eine Wohnung in einem 2-stöckigen
Haus, welches früher privates Eigen-
tum war und später SHAKT (Staatliche
Häuserverwaltung) unterstand. Nach dem
Tode meiner Mutter trat ich in das
Elektro-Technikum ein, wo ich im Pensionat
war

1934-1938 Tbilisi, Ulitsa Sowjetskaja ( Nummer
nicht in Erinnerung), Studentenheim des
Tbilisi Elektro-Technikums.

1938-1941 MICHA ZCHAKAJA, Ulitsa Tsulukidse Nr.14.
Hier mietete ich ein Zimmer in einem
privaten einstöckigem Haus, das einem
pensionierten Eisenbahn-Teichensteller,
Ilja LORDKIPANIDSE, gehörte, welcher
ein Zimmer vermieten musste, um etwas
zu seiner Fension dazuzuverdienen. Ilja's
Frau Keto( Katherina ) kümmerte sich um
meine Wäsche und kochte für mich wofür
ich extra etwas bezahlte. Das Ehepaar
hatte keine Kinder und behandelten mich
wie ihren eigenen Sohn.

1941-1946 Militärzeit

1946-1962 (bis zur Flucht) Micha Zchakaja, Ulitsa Schota Rustaveli
Nr. 25, die Privatwohnung meiner Gelieb
ten. Nina GANDELI. Ich liebte sie und
hatte mit ihr ein Verhältnis bevor ich


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 155

-13-

in den Krieg ging. Wahrend des Krieges
hörte ich, dass Nina's Mann im Krieg ge-
fallen war und ich entschloss mich nach
Zchakaja zurückzukehren um in ihrer Nähe
zu sein. Ich zog zu Nina und lebte mit ihr
zusammen ohne unsere Heirat bei SAGS (Re-
gistrierstelle von Geburten, Heiraten und
Sterbefälle) zu registrieren. Obwohl ich
erst darauf bestand unsere Verbindung zu
legalisieren wollte Nina es nicht, da sie in
ihrer ersten Ehe unglücklich war; sie wollte
frei sein um die Verbindung jeder Zeit lösen
zu können.

Während der letzten Jahre fand ich heraus,
dass Nina sich während meiner Abwesenheit
von zu Hause mit anderen Männern traf. Un-
stimmigkeiten entstanden, die mehr und mehr
wuchsen als die Zeit verging. Nachdem das
Verhältnis mit Nina sehr kühl geworden war,
fing ich an mich mit anderen Frauen zu tref-
fen. Wir waren oft daran uns endgültig zu
trennen, aber wir fanden immer wieder zu-
sammen. Ich versuchte verzweifelt unser
Problem zu lösen, denn ich hatte zu einem
Zeitpunkt als wir uns noch sehr nahe waren
Bemerkungen gegen die Regierung gemacht und
ich plante sogar eine gemeinsame Flucht aus
den USSR. Ich wollte sie nicht zusehr ver-
ärgern um sie nicht womöglich dazu zu brin-
gen, dass sie mich bei der Militia anzeigte.
Aber aus irgendwelchen Gründen wollte Nina
nicht gänzlich mit mir brechen und eines


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 156

- 14 -

Tages teilte sie mir mit, dass sie ein Kind erwarte und dass sie unsere Heirat legalisieren möchte. Da ich mich aber nicht als der Vater des Kindes betrachtete und da ich Erpressung von Ninas Seite fürchtete entschloss ich mich meine Flucht, die ich ohnehin schon geplant hatte, zu beschleunigen.

20. REISEN:

Keine anderen als schon erwähnt.

21. VERHAFTUNGEN:

Im Juni 1962 kam dieMilitia zu mir und bracht mich von meinem Arbeitsplatz zu ihrer Dienststelle wo ich beschuldigt wurde ein langjähriges Mitglied einer georgischen Widerstandsgruppe zu sein und regierungsfeindliche Ausserungen gemacht zu haben. Obwohl ich solche Bemerkungen bei verschiedenen Gelegenheiten gemacht hatte und deshalb schuldig im Sinne des letzteren Teils der Anschuldigung war, konnte ich fühlen, dass die Militia nicht genügend Informationen besass und ich verneintelalle Anschuldigungen. Ich konnte mir nicht denken wer dahinter steckte. Nach langen Verhören, bei denen ich über alle Einzelheiten meines Lebens, Eltern, Militärdienst, Kontakte, u.s.w. befragt wurde, wurde ich mit einer Warnung entlassen das Gebiet nicht zu verlassen und es wurde mir gesagt ich würde wieder von der Militia hören. Mit dieser einzigen Ausnahme bin ich nie verhaftet oder verhört worden, weder bei der Militia oder anderen Sicherheitsbehörden.

22. MITGLIEDSCHAFT IN POLICISCHEN PARTEIEN ODER ORGANISATIONEN:

Ich gehörte niemals der kommunistischen Partei an. Mir wurde nahe gelegt 1937 Komsomol beizutreten während ich am Tbilisi


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 157

-15-

Elektro-Technikum war. Dabei wurde von zwei Klassenkameraden die Bürgschaft übernommen, jeder von den beider war schon mehr als zwei Jahre Mitglied. Ich reichte mein Gesuch bei der lokalen Komsomol jatschejka (Zelle) ein und bei einer Zusammenkunft der Zellenmitglieder wurde mein Aufnahmegesuch besprochen, ich erzählte meine Lebensgeschichte und beantwortete Fragen. Nachdem ich aufgenommen worden war, erhielt ich meine Mitgliedskarte in ungefähr zwei Monaten vom Stadt-Rayon-Komittee des Tbilisi Komsomol; darauf hin besuchte ich Versammlungen und zahlte kleine Beiträge. Ich hatte niemals eine offizielle Position bei Komsomol. Als ich Tbilisi verliess musste ich mich von der Tbilisi Organisation streichen lassen und mich am neuen Wohnort Micha Zchakaja ( bei der Bevölkerung gewöhnlich nur "Zchakaja" genannt ), neu eintragen lassen. Dasselbe geschah als ich in die Armee eintrat (Ausstreichen aus der alten Organisation und Einschreiben am neuen Wohnort). Als ich nach der Entlassung von der Armee wieder nach Zchakaja zurückkehrte liess ich mich nicht wieder in die lokale Organisation eintragen.

Als ich in Zchakaja zu arbeiten begann wurde ich automatisch in die (prof.-org ) Gewerkschaft eingeschrieben, in der ich ein passives Mitglied war, das seine Beiträge (etwas wie 1% meines Gehaltes ) an den Organisator der Gewerkschaft von MTS bezahlte und von Zeit zu Zeit einer Pflichtversammlung beiwohnte. Ich machte nie Gebrauch von den Vorteilen der Mitgliedschaft wie ermässigte Preise in Erholungsstätten (putewka v dom otdicha ).

23. VERBINDUNGEN MIT EINEM SICHERHEITSDIENST:

Ich hatte nie einen Kontakt mit einer Sicherheitsbehörde. Ich wurde auch nie aufgefordert in irgendeiner Art für den sowjetischen Sicherheitsdienst zu arbeiten.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 158

## 24. FLUCHT

### A. GRÜNDE:

Trotzdem ich in einem kommunistischen Land geboren und erzogen worden war begann ich doch schon frühzeitig zu verstehen, dass für die Einzelperson keine Freiheit bestand. Es war mir auch klar, dass persönlicher Aufstieg nicht von dem Talent und der Rechtschaffenheit eines Menschen abhing, sondern von dem Ausmass der politischen Betätigung. Ich sah durch die kommunistischen Lügen, da die Wirklichkeit so verschieden von der offiziellen Propaganda war. Während und nach dem Krieg traf ich Menschen die westliche Länder besucht hatten und ich war in der Lage Bruchstücke der Wahrheit über den Unterschied in den Lebensarten aus diesen Erzählungen abzuleiten, obwohl diese Berichte sehr vorsichtig vorgebracht wurden. Nachdem ich 1956 ein gutes Radio der"Mir" Marke kaufte hörte ich sehr oft ausländischen Stationen zu. Lange Zeit trug ich mich mit der Idee aus den USSR zu fliehen wo ich keine Familie, keine Verwandten und keine Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten hatte. Meine feindliche Einstellung zur Regierung wurde stärker und stärker mit der Zeit und es wurde für mich immer schwieriger mich zu kontrollieren und diesen Gefühlen nicht offen Ausdruck zu verleihen, was ich dann doch einige Male tat. Meine Erfahrung mit der Militia und die Entwicklung meines persönlichen Lebens beschleunigte meine Fluchtpläne.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 159

B. TECHNISCHE EINZELHEITEN DER FLUCHT:

Am 25. Juni 1962, drei Tage nach meinen Erfahrungen mit der Militia, verliess ich meine Wohnung um 7 Uhr früh wie jeden Tag um in die Arbeit zu gehen. Ich verliess die Stadt zu Fuss in Richtung Samtredia. Ich trug meine normale Kleidung, hatte 80 Rubel bei mir und eine Handasche. Ich wagte nicht den Zug zu nehmen da ich Angst hatte von der Militia überwacht zu werden. Nachdem ich 2-3 km auf der Landstrasse gegangen war, wurde ich von einem Lastwagen eines nahe gelegenen Kolchos mitgenommen, der in der gleichen Richtung fuhr. Ich verliess den Lastwagen in der Stadtmitte von Samtredia, zahlte dem Fahrer einen Rubel und ging zur Eisenbahnstation; hier kaufte ich eine Fahrkarte nach Batumi und nahm den Zug um 11.50oder um 14.15 in Batumi ankam. Ich fand einen sicheren Platz und schlief bis zur Dunkelheit. Ich verliess Batumi zu Fuss entlang des Seeufers bis ich 1 1/2 oder 2 km südlich die alte Schiess-Stätte erreichte. Hier ging ich um ungefähr 22 Unr ins Wasser, nachdem ich meinen Pass zerstört hatte (die anderen Dokumente liess ich zu Hause) und vergrub meine Kleider und Tasche. Ich wusste durch das Studium einer Landkarte, dass ich ungefähr 18 km zu schwimmen hatte um türkisches Gebiet zu erreichen. Ich schwamm die ganze Nacht und ich war nicht sicher ob ich schon türkisches Gebiet erreicht hatte aber ich war erschöpft und schwamm ungefähr um 3 Uhr oder 4 Uhr früh zum Ufer. An dem Punkt wo ich ankam began das Ufer steil anzusteigen. Ich sah die Silhuette einer Hütte und ging hinein. Da fand ich einen alten elektri-schen Motor, Bussisch beschriftet, woraus ich ersah, dass ich noch in Russland war. Ich versteckte mich in der Nähe


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 160

-18-

im Gebüsch und verbrachte dort die Nacht und den fol-
genden Tag. Als es dunkel wurde, kletterte ich den Ab-
hàng hinauf um das Gelände zu überblicken. Ich ging
ein Stück und hörte russische Stimmen die vom Ufer kamen.
Ich sah einen dunklen Gegenstand auf dem Wasser, welcher
wie ein Unterseebot aussah. Ich ging weiter am Ufer
entlang und um ungefähr 22 oder 23 Uhr ging ich ins
Wasser und schwamm 3 km hinaus und dann parallel zum
Ufer. Als ich in die Reichweite eines Suchlichtes kam,
das über dem Wasser spielte, tauchte ich unter. Als
ich nach oben kam ging das Suchlicht gerade über mich
hinweg, aber nichts geschah und ich wusste, dass ich
unendeckt geblieben war. Ich schwamm bis zur Erschöpfung,
einige Stunden vor der Morgendämmerung schwamm ich zum
Ufer und versteckte mich in einer Höhle zwischen zwei
Felsen im Meer in Ufernähe. Da verblieb ich zum Morgen.
Am nächsten Morgen kletterte ich den Abhang hinauf, wo
ich ein steinernes Gebilde sah, das wie ein Grab aus-
sah. Ich ging hinein und schaute mir die Umgebung durch
eine kleine Öffnung an. Ich sah ein kleines Dorf, später
lernte ich, dass es Kemal-Pascha war. Erst dachte ich
ein Minarett wäre ein Beobachtungsturm. Ich nahm an,
es wäre das Dorf Sarpi noch immer auf russischem Boden.
Ich war sehr durstig und kletterte den Hügel hinunter
zu einem Bach um zu trinken. Ich traf einen ll oder
12 jährigen Buben den ich russisch ansprach, aber der
Bub lief weg. Ich war noch immer nicht sicher wo ich
war, ich ging ein Stück im Bach um meine Fussabdrücke"
zu verbergen. Dann versteckte ich mich im Gebüsch bis
zur Dunkelheit. Ich ging dann um das Dorf herum zum
anderen Ende. Ich betrat das Dorf und klopfte an die
Tür eines Hauses, das am Abhang eines Hügels lag. Ich


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 161

-19-

rief in russischer Sprache. Ich hörte Stimmen und Fuss-
tritte im Haus, aber niemand öffnete. Ich klettere auf
das Dach eines Stalles im Hof und verbrachte dort die
Nacht. Früh am nächsten Morgen wurde ich durch Geräusche
im Hof geweckt. Ich sah einige Frauen und zwei Männer.
Ich näherte mich ihnen und versuchte mich durch Zeichen-
sprache zu verständigen und zu erklären, dass ich aus
Russland kam. In der Zwischenzeit waren Menschen mit
Stöcken und Axten auf den Hof gekomen. Ich versuchte
wieder zu erklären, dass ich aus Russland käme und in
der Türkei verbleiben möchte. Die Männer nahmen mich dann
zu den militärischen Behörden in Kemal-Pascha.

Als ich in Batumi ins Wasser ging, hatte ich Schwimmhosen
an, einen Gürtel und ein paar Schwim-flossen. Ich hatte
ein Klappmesser im Gürtel, einen Sack Nadeln um mich zu
stechen im Falle eines Krampfes, mein Geld war in einem
Nylonsack, 3 Tafel Schockolade, ein Kompass und zwei
Phenamin Tabletten um meine Energie zu heben, irpinem
anderen Nylonsack. Mit Ausnahme des Suchlichtes auf dem
Wasser, das ich durch Tauchen zu umgehen suchte, gab es
keine anderen Hindernisse.

Ich hatte niemanden von meinen Fluchtplänen erzählt und
niemand hat mir dabei geholfen..

Von Kemal-Pascha, wo ich Kleider bekan, wurde ich mit dem
Wagen nach Erserum gebracht und von dort mit dem Zug nach
Istanbul ins Flüchtlingslager. Dort war ich eine Woche
und wurde dann mit Hilfe von US Behörden am Freitag den
6. Juli 1962 nach Deutschland gebracht.

25 DOKUMENTE:
A. PASS:
Ich erhielt meinen ersten drei Jahre gültigen Pass von der


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 162

-20-

Militia Dinststelle Nr. 17 (Pass Abteilung) des Molotowski
Rayon von Tbilisi, wo ich damals wohnte. Der Pass war ein
einzelnes Blatt Papier und meinem Photo und den wichtigsten
Daten. 1939 tauschte ich ihn gegen einen 5-Jahres Pass ein,
bei der Militia des Micha Zchakaja Rayons ausgestellt. Das
war ein Pass in der üblichen Buchform mit Photo und wich-
tigsten Daten und hatte einen propiska Stempel ( Registra-
tion mit der Militia), welcher den Tag meiner Ankunft in
dieser Stadt und meine Adresse enthielt. Als ich in die
Armee eingezogen wurde, gab ich den Pass und das Militär-
buch bei den rayonvojenkomat ab und bekam ihn nach meiner
Entlassung wieder ausgehändigt. Darauf hin erhielt ich ei-
nen neuen 5-Jahres Pass von der gleichen Dienststelle mit
propiska, welcher meine neue Adresse anzeigte. 1951 tauschte
ich diesen Pass gegen einen neuen 10-Jahres Pass ein und
1961 gegen wiederum einen neuen 10 Jahre gültigen Pass.

B. MILITÄRBUCH: ( Wojennii Bilet )

Siehe Para. 18. In der Armee hatte ich ein Soldbuch
( slushebnaja knishka ), welches ich meinem rayonwojenkomat
nach meiner Entlassung aus der Armee übergab.

C. ARBEITSBUCH: ( Trudowaja Knishka )

Ich besass keines, da es von dem Arbeitsgeber ausgestellt
wird und wenn jemand seinen Arbeitsplatz ändert , dem neuen
Arbeitsgeber übergeben wird. Ich aber habe niemals meinen
Arbeitsplatz verändert.

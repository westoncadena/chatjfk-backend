THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE: Cuban national presently residing in the United States.

Source was a prominent sports writer and a very active member of the Havana Yacht Club. He is presently employed as a reporter on a large newspaper and is in close contact with Cuban exile leaders.

[This report was developed by an AFNIN Air Force representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

[ON FILE IN THE CIA LIBRARY is a copy, in Spanish, of the Frente Interno de, Unidad Revolucionaria - FIUR.]

1. A Cuban exile, Julio Leal, residing at 4823 East 8th Court, Hialeah, Florida, claims to be the US Delegate of the "Cuban Government in Arms". He also claims that he received a copy of a proclamation prepared by members of the FIUR, in Cuba, and was authorized to release it to publicity sources. He provided me with a copy of the FIUR declaration. [See On File Material.]

2. On 25 Apr 63 Leal furnished me with a copy of a document, in Spanish, which showed the appointments to executive and cabinet posts of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Cuba in Arms. The names are:

President - To be announced at a later date for reasons of security.
Vice-President - Dr Gustave Cuerve Rubio
Premier - Dr Jose Manuel Gutierrez
Secretary to the President - To be announced at a leter date.
Minister of State - Dr Carlos Prie Socarras

Minister of Agriculture - Now in Cuba, name not revealed for security reasons.

Minister of Public Housing - To be announced at a later date.

The following individuals have been named Ministers without portfolio and subsecretaries:

Jose Ignacio Rivero

Manuel Reyes

Jorge Castellanos

Lauraeano/Batista Falla

Agusto Fernandez Conde

Manuel Salvat

Humberte Medrano

Fermin Peinado

Melchor Gaston

Manuel Fernandez

Enrique Huertas

Designated Ambassador to Washington - Dr Guillermo Belt

OAS Delegate - Dr Herminio Portell Wila

3.  I doubt that Leal has been designated as the US representative for FIUR, and do not believe that the documents he gave me originated in Cuba. I suspect that another group of exiled Cuban politicians wrote the document in the US, and are trying to get national publicity in order to get support.

I have recently heard that Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo has been added to the list of Cabinet appointments. I doubt very much that Gutierrez and Ray would be fully accepted by the majority of Cubans in exile.

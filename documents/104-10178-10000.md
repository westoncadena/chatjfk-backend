IMPLEMENT ITS PREVIOUS PLAN TO MONITOR THROUGH A SENSITIVE TECHNICAL OPERATION THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COLOMBIAN DELEGATION TO THE BORDER NEGOTIATIONS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN ROME, ITALY, ON 19 MARCH 1973. THE VENEZUELAN 14-MAN GROUP FROM THE DIRECTORATE OF THE SERVICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND PREVENTION (DISIP), WHICH WILL ACCOMPANY THE VENEZUELAN DELEGATION TO THE TALKS, WILL LIMIT ITS ACTIVITIES TO THE PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC SECURITY OF THE VENEZUELAN CONTINGENT. SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY ARISE TO USE SECURELY A TECHNICAL OPERATION TO MONITOR THE COLOMBIAN DELEGATION, ANOTHER DISIP TEAM OF FROM FOUR TO SEVEN VENEZUELANS WILL BE SENT TO HANDLE THIS. (SOURCE COMMENT: BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT A VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY COLDE OFFICER PASSED INFORMATION TO THE COLOMBIANS BASED ON THE VENEZUELAN TECHNICAL OPERATION TARGETTED AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN DELEGATION AT THE LAST ROUND OF TALKS, THE VENEZUELANS FEAR THAT THE COLOMBIANS WILL BE EXPECTING A SIMILAR OPERATION AND MAY TRY TO RECIPROCATE BY MONITORING THE VENEZUELAN DELEGATION. FOR THIS REASON, THE VENEZUELANS HAVE DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT COUNTER-ESPIONAGE RATHER THAN ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS DURING THIS SERIES OF TALKS. ALSO,

## 18. WKSCARLET-3:

During this reporting period WKSCARLET-3 produced eleven disseminations and contributed to four others. As a chief of one of the operations sections of his service, it appeared that he would continue to have excellent access. However, in December WKSCARLET-1 reorganized his service and ostensibly reduced our agent's area of responsibility and secess. WKSCARLET-3 vas slightly depressed at this occurrence as he believed, and rightly so, that he had not merited this reduction. After the holidays, however, it became apparent that WKSCARLET-1 would conthue to use WKSCARLET-3 in special operations and that the reduction in responsibility was solely to take WKSCARLAT-3 out of the limelight. Thus, our agent is still able to report on the sensitive operations of his service. As a result of this and his past performance, WKSCARLET-3 vas given a salary increase beginning January 1973.

## 7. WKSCARLET-3

Although WKSCARLET-3 continued his fine production during this time period, it was HAPYSS activity which produced the real interest. Through other cables and dispatches we have reported his involvement in this irregular activity, which if proved true will end in his termination as a BKHERALD asset. At the present time WKSCARLET-3 is the security team leader for the Venezuelan delegation to the Gulf of Maracaibo talks presently being held in Rome. It is planned that soon after he returns, and if we have sufficient hard facts, we will confront our agent in an attempt to clarify his CIABYSS connection.

DOI 8 December 1972

SUBJECT Reorganization of the Directorate of the Service of Intelligence and Prevention

ACQ Venezuela, Caracas (15 December 1972) FIELD NO. HVC-6525

SOURCE An experienced police investigator whose position gives him access to information on matters affecting the internal security of Venezuela. He reports without the knowledge of his superiors. His information has been frequently con- firmed by independent sources. He provided a copy of the reorganization document.

1. On 8 December 1972 the Directorate of the Service of Intelligence and Prevention (DISIP) was reorganized by its Director, Dr. Remberto Uzcategui Bruzual.

(Source Comment: Uzcategui believes DISIP will be in line for criticism during the election year of 1973 and he wants to remove from positions of responsibility any of his controversial section heads.) The gist of the document issued by Uzcategui reorganizing DISIP follows.

2. The Director of DISIP sets the general policy based on instructions from the Ministry of the Interior and has ultimate control of the Services. The Deputy Director assists him in carrying out these responsibilities and substitutes for the director during his absence. As its supervisory and fiscal units, DISIP has an Inspector General of Services who has the responsibility of disciplining personnel and investi- gating employees, and an internal comptroller who verifies the administration of the Services.

3. The following are the DISIP executive positions:

a. Secretary General of Services, which has been assigned to Dr. Oswaldo Dominguez.

STATUS OF PROJECT AGENTS:

13. This period showed that while WKSCARLET-3 does have a highly responsible position within his organisasion, he still is being ordered to do special assignments by the chief of the service. These assignants usually Involve out-of-town travel and/or long and unusual working hours. This pre- cludes regular scheduled meetings; however, the agent is contacted on the average of once a week. WKSCARLET-3, along with his normal routine duties, vas involved in a number of varied activities during the reporting period which he duly reported to the Station. He continues to investigate all possible leads in the kidnapping case of Carlos Domingues. In August he led a small tean to Cucuta, Colombia where they uncovered and destroyed a small printing shop which was engaged in the fabrication of false Venesuelan identity cards. He continues the investigation of the activities of Sergio Pineda Ruiz, the Prensa Latina chief in Caracas. The problem of agent/case officer communications has been somewhat alleviated. The agent now contacts the case officer at the latter's home during the evening hours. This doesn't obviate the need for an RS-708 system, but until the details for a concealment device that vill be appropriate for WKSCARLET-3's rather spartan office are worked out, phone contact is necessary. During the reporting period WKSCARLET-3 produced three disseminations and contributed to one other.

11. In mid-April CIFENCE-4 was placed in charge of yet another of the CIRACH divisions, with added responsibility and importance. This change has allowed him more time in Caracas, and reflects a continually improving position vis-a-vis CIFENCE-1, the CIRASH Director. This coupled with what now appears the likelihood that CIFENCE-1 will retain this present position until the government changes in early 1974, makes the longevity of CIFENCE-4 with CIRASH somewhat more certain. As part of his new responsibilities, CIFENCE-4 has initiated an extensive investigation of Prensa Latina and its Caracas Director, Sergio Pineda Ruiz. This operation was interrupted in early June by the kidnapping of Venezuelan industrialist Carlos Dominguez, with CIFENCE-4 being placed in charge of the CIRASH investigation of the as yet unresolved case. As of this writing, CIFENCE-4 has been devoting all of his time to this kidnapping case, to the detriment of other operations. Because of the unpredictable work schedule of CIFENCE-4 and the security precautions observed by the Station in contacting him, operational communication has been less efficient than desirable during the reporting period, while security has been maintained. The arrangements have been reviewed and improved, but the Station is looking for a more satisfactory system. The Station tentatively plans to request an RS-708 system for this agent in the near future. CIFENCE-4 contributed to two reports during the April through June quarter.

REGM Chief of Station, Caracas

SUBJECT Ricardo MORALES Navarrete

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1. On approximately 5 March 1972, a Station asset, CIFENCE-4, while acting in his cover capacity had occasion to detain and question one Ricardo MORALES Navarrete, a Cuban resident of Miami.

2. Morales N. told CIFENCE-4 that he, Morales, is employed by LNERGO from whom he receives a salary of US$700 per month. Morales said that he was en route to Colombia on a drug case at the time. During the conversation Morales admitted to CIFENCE-4 having been responsible for a killing in Florida.

3. CIFENCE-4 reported to the Station the above, as well as stating that Morales has an extremely poor reputation in the Cuban community, where he is prone to tell nearly anyone willing to listen of his affiliation with LNERGO, with the implication that his employer sanctions his activities.

4. Morales also told CIFENCE-4 that a Cuban (true name of CIGOAL-5) who works with SIFA in Caracas is an agent of BKTRUST.

5. Attached is a copy of the reentry permit of Morales, as well as a clipping from the Miami press relating to the killing which Morales allegedly confessed to having committed.

6. The above is for the information of Station WH/Miami and further action as deemed appropriate. No coordination with LNERGO in Caracas has been effected due to security considerations involving CIFENCE-4.

Cuarto 1309, Hospital Jackson Memorial, 7:10 P.M. Miercoles Dietembre 4 de 1968.

"Yo. JULIO ATON CONSTANZO PALAU, del 752 S.W. Cuarta calle, Miami, Florida, casado con Mara Constanzo, la cual esti aquí presente, declaro lo si- galente: Naci en Palma Soriano, Oriente, en Cuba, el 22 de Mayo de 1936. Yo tengo 32 afos de edad. Me casd el 10 de Marzo de 1933 en Miami, Florida. Yo no soy un ciudadano de Estados Unidos, Yo soy un residente, y tengo una dija, Elizabeth, la cual cumplira cinco años de cuad el 24 de diciembre, la cual nació aqui, en este Hospital, Jackson Memorial. Mi prapósito de hacer estas declaraciones se debe al hecho que la policía ha permitido que pasea varios

dras, y la gente que intento quitarme la vida está afuera en la calle, libres.

El 22 de noviembre, alrededor de las 8.30 de la noche, a unas tres cuadras de mi casa, yo estaba caminan- do y me bad de la acera en la Tavenida y la Segunda calle, en la sección del S.W., cuando of a alguien lla- marine "Aión, y mire para ver quien era, y enton- ces yo senti que ellos me disparaban, y yo vilas ar- mas con silenciadores.

Yo vi a Ricardo Morales Navarrete, y el estaba ea in Chevrolet Impala 1965, de dos puertas, amari- llo con dos luces de cola. Estaba situado en el medio de calle.

Este hombre, Ricardo Morales Navarrete estaba ca el asteato de atrás, en la lado izquierdo. El tenía un fusil M-3, con un silenciador, el cual dispara balas caitbre 45.

Otro hombre camba manejando, y yo lo conozco de vista, pero no sé su nombre verdadero. Lo Harman cca ei apodo de "El Gallego". Este hombre, F: Gallego, tena wa pistoia que parecía una Beretta, con un si- lenciador adaptado.

Anibos me dispararon. Yo recibí 15 heridas de ba- la y 21 perforaciones.

La tercer hombre estaba en el carro, llamado Francisco Rodríguez al que apodan "El Mejicano", el cual no disparó.

Yo Identifico a Ricardo Morales Navarrete como al mismo hombre qué testifics para el Gobierno en el jul- cio de Orlando Bosch.

Dos días antes yo lo va a con esta otra persona, El Gallego, observándome ea frente de mi casa. Ellos estsian en otro carro, un Polara.

Yo conosco a este Morales Navarrete de La Habana, A era Jefe Asistente de la Sección del G-2 en el Aero- puerto de Rancho Boyeros, Habana, Cuba.

Yo no he hablado con di, pero otro hombre, Eddy Fernández Pin, hace casi dos meses, vino a mi casa. a eso de la una de la madrugada para darme un mensa- je de Ricardo Morales Navarrete y del Mejicano Fran cisco Rodriguez Tamayo los cuales no querían ser mis enemigos, que el enemigo era batista, y que debía- mos ser amigos porque las cosas iban a cambiar.

Yo le dije que no querh tener ninguna amistad con gente que trabajaba para Fidel Castro.

La noche que Eddy Ferrand Pia vino a mi casa, estaba con otro hombre, Kogelio Fernández, el cual es un vendedor de la Firestone.

Yo tengo una baia niojada cerca de mi corazóa y tie- ne que ser extrafda con un aparato especial, según me dijo el médico.

En estos tres últimos días ro me he sentido blen y como tengo todos estos tiros en mi cuerpo se que es- toy en una mala condición y me siento como que voy a morir, v si mucro, no quiero morir sin que este gran pars castigue a es.os, asesinos, los cuales son nefastos : para toda la sociedad.

Hago estas declaraciones completamente consciente de sus conte nidos, sin coacción y de mi propis y libre voluntad.

He tenido atención médica para a..viar el dolor, y no me siento bajo la inaccacia de ninguia droga, pero me siento muy normal y hago estas declaraciones por las razones antes expuestas".

## Ubicación y descripción geográfica de la región. Su acceso:

1. 1. El lugar donde se encuentra establecido el Campo minero "La Salvación" está ubicado al Sur-Oeste del Estado Bolívar, en pleno corazón de la selva, cercano a las riveras del Rio Guanigmo, unas dos horas aproximadamente por vía aérea desde Ciudad Bolivar. El mencionado poblado esta enclavado en una superficie plana cuyos contornos estan sembrados de innumerables elevaciones de tierras que forman parte del macizo Guayanés.

1. 2. La única via de acceso es aérea, ya que por la naturaleza de la región y su gran distancia de los centros poblados, es prácticamente imposible que se haga por otros medios. A tal fin se

nas que van oporeciendo y dodde co agrupan tem
porelmente gran número de personaз.-

Puntualizando lo antes dicho existo un coropuer
to que sirva como Base do Operaciones en la región, iden-
tificado como Aeropuerto de "La Contella", con una longie
tud de ochocientos (800) metros de pista de tierro, sien-
do este el de mayor tamaño y desde donde se hacen 108
trasbordos en avionotes mas pequoíías que salen a los pro-
pios cempos mineros, situados on un årsa no mayor de quin
ce (15) minutos de vuelo.

En el caso de "La Salvación", este campamento-
minero se encuentra exactamente a unos siete minutos de -
vuelo saliendo del Aeropuerto "La Contelle". La pista de
atorrizaje es igualmente de tierra con apenas trescientos
ochanta (300) metros de longitud, lo que hace sumamento -
poligroso au utilización, maa cồn cuando observamos que
sa encuentra rodeada de árboles gigantescos que alcanzan-
40 y 50 metros de altura. Por las características descri-
tas, en esta pista han ocurrido varios accidentes aéreos-
causando muertos, heridos y varios aparutos destruidos de
los cuales actualmente se pueden apreciar en el sitio cin
co totalmente insorvibles; igualmente no so utilizon 100
equipos de radio entre les avionotas y los acropuertos, a

sabilidad de las linoas adreas y los propius pilotos,
quiones buscando mayor beneficio sobrecargan los aviones-
a veces hasta con el doble dal poso permitido, sin que 0-
xista ningún control de Comunicaciones para regular tal g
normalidad. Un ejemplo claro lo constituye la Linea "A--
SERCA", que en un año registró trece accidentes en la ra-
gión.-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

## 2. Condiciones de vida y de trabajo do la población ming

### 2.1. Las condicionas du vide do la población que al canza aproximadamento a unas 6.000 persones (pero que llegó a toner al año pasado unas 15.000), dejan mucho qua descar on el aspecto-sanitario, habitacional y moral. Las aquas quo corren por el lugar estan contaminadas por el esparcimianto indiscriminado de excrementos on las márgaones, de laa quebradas y pequeñas rios, así como en el interior del propio pobla do. Las onfermedados, como el paludismo y ami-biosis, se observan con bastante frecuencia por falta de asistencia y control sanitarios-las enfermadades vondreas abundan por no axistir un riguroso control sobre el gran nomazo de prostitutas que existen en la población. La totalidad de las viviendao estan construidas con cartones, tablas y láminas do zinc, que ag casamente protegen a sus moradores de las inclemencias del tiempo, siendo mas grave la ai-tuación por la gran cantidad de niños que ออก llevados por sus padres al lugar, por damás po ligroso e inapropiado para ellos, sin que tam-poco exista ninguna ragulación o control al rospecto.

La prostitución cobra marcado incremento en eg tas zonas, atrayendo mujores desde diferentes-lugares de la República y de países vecinos cmo Colombia y Brasil, que se agrupan en improvisados bares situados dentro de la poblacióη, provocando hechos reñidos con la moral qua 80 llevan a cabo en presencia de nifños y de honag tas familias de minerou.

Prolifera en sus diferentes manifestaciones el Juago, siendo lou mas comunes la bareja y los8-dados, bingos, etc., estos últimos son trans tidos per sltavoces dandole un aspecto de fo--


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

rie nocturna al poblado.-

2. 2. Generalmante los mineros forman grupos de trabajo constituyendo pequeñdo sociedades entre - las que se repartiré la ganancia quu logren obtener, pero como caracen de recursos indiapan- sublos so ven obligados a incluir como socios- a personas que les prestan los implementos de trabajo o que financian su alimentación, cons- tituyeddo esta forma una especie de oxplota ción si se toma en cuenta que generalmente exgeran los cantidades consumidas por los mine- ros. Los compradores de diamantos oprovechan la pecesidad de vender los diamantes encontre- dos por los mineros, para pagarlos a precios - muy por debajo de su valor real y los ospecula dores aprovechan para elevar los precios de- los alimentos, medicinas, etc., llegando an ol portunidades de escasez a vender hasta en Bs - 40 un kilogramo de arroz. Actualmente dada la competencia y los constantes viajes que efec - tuan al lugar las diferentes líneas aéreas, en tre cllas: "ASERCA", "AEROVEN", "GATIZSA", "LA TINCARGA", "AEROTECNICA" y "COMERAVIA", los precios han dejado de ser tan exagerados..

3. Actuación de las autoridades:

3. 1. Lakprimera autoridad civil del lugar está re- presontada por un Comisario General de nombre- JOSE TOMAS GAONA ESPINOZA, pero el verdadero - control sobre la población es ejercido por la- Guardia Nacional y para el momento da la pre- sente averiguación estaba constátuida por un grupo de cuatro Guardias, comandados por un Cabo de apellido CARPIO; este grupo es completa- mante nuevo en el lugar, a raíz de la salida del Teniente LUIS PRIN y de su segundo, un Cabo de apellido PINATE, quiones fueron someti- dos a investigación por su propio Comando al cousa do fracuantes denuncias de presuntas i- rregularidades cometidas en ejercicio de sus


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

y minaros del lugar, pudimos obtener informa--
ción coincidente entre los mismos inforaintss-
de lau/actividades desagradables para ellos da
sarrollodas por lcs afectivos do la Guardia Na
cional, citando atropellos cometidos por ul To
niente LUIS PRIN y el Cabo PIRATE, destacando-
entre ellcs los siguientes:

Que cuando ol Tariente LUIS PRIN VILLEGAS era
el Jafe de la Guardia Nacional en "La Salva -
ción", existia al Bar "Bajuquero", cuye dueña-
aparentemente era la ciudadana PETRA GUAPE,
quien era påblicamente amante del Teniante
PRIN, ya que ezan vistos caminar tomades de la

ella en el lacel dal mismc Bar, lo grave de --

te ordeneba el cierre de todos los demás bares

Los propios Guardias que si querían seguir to-
mando podían continuar en el Bar "Bejuqusro",-
donde en varios oportunidades se vió a les
Guardias uniformados despachando cervezas a-
los clientes en el interior de ese Bar, por lo
qua se generalizó entre los pobladores la idea
de que el Tta. PRIN tenía parte en el negocio.
Igualmente informan los entrevistados que los
Guardias Nacionales que comandaba el Tta. PRIN
VILLEGAS, especialmente el Cabo PIÑATE, se da-
ban a la terea de padir a los mineros parte de
la tierra que sacaban y donde podría haber o
nó diamantes; igualmente cobraban una especie-
de impuesto a las personas que administraban -
las casas do juages. Narran las personas entre
vistadas que en una oportunidad los nincros, y

que ou amign, quien lo golped, sin mala inton-
ción, no opuso ninguna resistencia y volunta--
riamonte manifestó a la Guardio Nacional que
estaba dispuesto a enviar al médico por su
cuenta a su amigo y a pagar un arresto si era-
necesario, cosa esta que no sucedió pues el -
Toniente ordenő esposarlo y propinerle cinco
planazos en presencia del pueblo para asf sen-
tar un precedente de respeto, segån expresó.-
Se pudo conocer que el año pasado, por el mes-
de Noviembre, por orden de la Guardia Nacional
se llevó a cabo una reunión en el Bar del Se--
ñor ZABALA, y donde asistieron además el Coro-
nel VALDERRAMA y el Tte. Cnel BECERRA, proce--
dentes del Destacamento acantonado en San Fer
nando de Apure. En esta reunión se planted le-
necesidad de que cclaborarar los comerciantoa-
de la localidad para la construcción del Coman
do de la Guerdia Nacional en esa mina; los co-
merciantes aceptaron hacerlo y negocio a nogo-
cio fueron visitados dando on 100 y 200 boliva
res cada uno, esta colaboración no fue del
grado de los comerciantes, pero por temor a ra
presalias prefirieron colaborar no pudiendo de
terminar la cantidad recogida, pero se estima-
he varics miles de bolivares, con la suma de -
dinero donada se construyó un galpón de zinc,
cercado con alembres de påas que en la actuali
dod hace las veces de Comando de la Guardia Ng
cional en "La Salvación".-

Un Mayor de los Fuerzas Aéreas Venezolanos de-
apellido SEGUIA, se ha hecha en les mines hom-
bre importante en su condición de comerciante.
Adquirió junto con otros cocios la Lines aérea
"ASERCA", piloteando personalmente uno da BUS
aviones, especificamente el identificado con
las siglas: YV-C-ASI-, donde transporta perso-
nas y carga, especialmente corvaza traide des-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

de Valencia y Maracay, constituyéndose así en-
el mayor distribuidor de corveza en la mina; además pose la Saice fábrica de hielo que exige te en el lugar y una planta para tratamiento del agua, la que igualmente vende en la mina.-
Estos negocios están administrados por un hermano suyo, y que las maquinarias de la compa- ñía que fabrica hielo y potabiliza el agua, distinguida con el nombre de SAFER, fueron trasladadas a la mina en un avión de carga de las Fuerzas Aéreas.-

Esta comisión pudo ver personalmente al Mayor SEGUÍA en su función de piloto comercial cobrando a los mineros que transportaba; igualmente la comisión le observó en traje civil, pero según informaron las personas interrogadas, este militar frecuentemente ha sido visto con su uniforme de las Fuerzas Aéreas, por lo que se puede deducir de que actualmente se encuentra activo en nuestras Fuerzas Aéreas.-
De la actuación de los Guardias Nacionales que actualmente se encuentran en "La Salvación" al mando del Cabo CARPIO, no hay acusaciones por atropellos, solamente y eso se pudo notar, toleran el juego y protegen algunos bares que permanecen abiertos hasta pasada dla hora normal. Entre estos bares figura uno donde se practica la prostitución y cuya dueña, de nombre ROSA, se jacta públicamente de ser "la primera dama de La Salvación" por el hecho de ser la amante del Cabo CARPIO.-

En conversación sostenida en un plano amistoso con ol Cabo CARPIO, éste manifestó a la comisión que ellos aceptaban regalos en dinero de parte de los Dineros por el poco sueldo que devengaban en un lugar como ese donde el costo de la vida es tan elevado.
Esta comisión, luego de hablar con las parso-

que han suministrado algunas de estas informaciones, puedan adelantar que los mismos estarán en condiciones de rendir declaraciones escritas si se les exige, pero hicieron la recomendación de que en ese caso había que hacerlo con suma discreción por temor a futuras represalias.-

Es todo cuanto tenemos que informar al respecto.

A.- DIAMANTES.- Primera Parte

1 SITUACION EXISTENTE EN VENEZUELA

1.  1 Generalidades

En 1970 la producción diamantífera Venezolana alcanzó 508.661 quilates, siendo esta producción la más alta en la historia de esta actividad en el país. Con relación a 1959 la producción ha triplicado según se desprende de los cuadros anexos de producción.

Esta producción ha sido lograda en su casi totalidad bajo el sistema de libre aprovechamiento, sinónimo de sub-desarrollo en los aspectos técnico, social y económico. En el aspecto técnico el sub-desarrollo se manifiesta en los sistemas rudimentarios de explotación que no permiten al cabal aprovechamiento del yacimiento.

En el aspecto social son de todos conocidas las condiciones infrahumanas en que se desenvuelve la vida del minero, con la falta de servicios elementales, vías de comunicación, falta de seguridad personal imposibilidad de lograr una superación personal a través de una comunidad y familia estables.

En el aspecto económico los circuitos de mercadeo existentes hacen que el minero se encuentre a merced de los compradores organizados a quienes venden su producción en las condiciones que le son fijadas.

Por otra parte hay que señalar que el libre aprovechamiento solo puede ser utilizado donde concurren ciertas condiciones físicas como alta concentración del diamante y agua suficiente para las técnicas primitivas de lavado.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

-8-

Con el nivel de producción actual y la riqueza potencial axia-
tento se hace nacesorio efectuar modificaciones an la forma de
aprovechamiento, introduciendo técnicas industriales de trabajo.

Igualmente es de señalar quo la ley y reglamento ectuales de Mi-
nas datan del año 1944, cuando la producción diamantifera no al-
canzaba ni siquiera al 10% de los niveles actuales. Su modifica-
ción es imperativa a efectos de introducir nuevas regulaciones
consonas con las técnicas existentes inclusive en países manos de-
sarrollados que Venezuela.

No se pretende recomendar la eliminación de la explotación del
diamante bajo el sistema de libre aprovechamiento por las impli-
caciones socio-políticas que esta medida tendría, para si comple-
mentarla con la utilización de métodos industriales de aprovechamien-
to enmarcada dentro de una legislación actualizada.

El Ministerio de Minas conoce los pormenores de la explotación
bajo el libre aprovechamiento desde hace tiempo, recalcada por los
Ings. Francisco Izquierdo y Oleg Andreiev, expertos del MMH, en
varias oportunidades.

La actividad diamontifera en Venezuela reviste enorme importancia
según puede apreciarse en las cifras siguientes, (sobra datos de
1970):

* Representa el 1,5% de la producción mundial, estimada ofi-
  cialmente en 46 millones de quilates.

* Utiliza una fuerza de trabajo entre 10.000 y 15.000 mineros.
  De la cifra anterior es dificil determinar al porcentaje de
  Venezolanos y de Extranjeros indocumentados que trabajan en
  asta actividad.

* Aporta a la Nación ingresos fiscalizados de 30.millones
  de bolivares de los cuales el Gobierno percibe en calidad
  de impuesto de explotación un 3%.

* 51 wifima Miamit-Fairbairn citiama

- 9 -

*   Por información bancaria obtenida extrooficialmente, hemos podido saber que procedentes del exterior fué girada a Ciudad Bolivar una suma cercana a los 70 millones de bolivaros destinada a compra de diamantes durante 1970.

*   Adoptando una cifra conservadora de 50 millones de boliva- res como valor de la producción de diamantes, esto represen- taría un 10% del aporte que hace al Producto Territorial Bruto el Sector Minero.

*   La explotación del diamante determina una serie de inversio- nes en actividades conexas, altamente remuneradoras por lo ge- neral, como por ejemplo las líneas de aviación locales para transporte de mineros como Aerotécnica, Comeravis, Gatic f.A., Tanca, etc.

*   Fuente de ingresos para las Municipalidades. El Comercio en el Guaniamo cancela B. 15.000 mensuales a la Municipalidad del Distrito Cedeño del Estado Bolivar (sin prestación de servicio alguno hasta la fecha.).

# 12.- Especificacionge dol Dicmente venezolano

## Origan

El diamanto venezolano proviene de Guayana (Provincia de Roraima y Cuchivero).

Es un diamante de aluvión 6 ses que se encuentra en el cauce de los ríos, 6 forma en terrazas aluvionales depósitos ubicados a poca profundidad: 3 a 15 metros de acuerdo a la topografía.

En algunes regiones del mundo, los diamantes se encuentran en "chimeneas" 6 "pipes"; únicas fuentes primarias de diamantes conocidas-ejemplo: Kimberley (Africa del Sur) - en otras en depósitos aluvionales como en Venezuela 6 en las playas del Sur Oeste de Aftica; 6 en una combinación de ambos - ejemplo: Yakutia, Rusia.

No todas las "chimineas" son productivas y 75% de la producción mundial proviene de aluvión.

La riqueza de los depósitos depende:

- del tenor en diamantes del materiel extraido
- de la proporción entre los tipos, talla-industrial-bort
- de las características de las piedras (morfológicas y de color)

## Tenor

En Venezuela la cantidad de quilates por tonelada métrica es satisfactoria; para el Guaniamo se puede evaluar en 0,4 - 0,5 quilates por toneleda métrica - cantidad que justifica la pormanencia en el sitio del Minero de Libre Aprovechamiento. ( 1 quilates 0,2 gramos)

Los valores promedios de los tenores de los yacimientos del grupo De Beers en Africa del Sur son de 0,2 a 0,3 según se desprende del Informe Anual 1969 de De Beers Consolidated Mines LTD.

COMPARACION ENTRE VENEZUELA Y EL GRUPO DE BEERS EN RELACION CON LA PRESENCIA DE DIAMANTE ENCONTRADO

ACTIVIDAD DIAMANTIFERA DEL GRUPO DE BEERS EN 1.969

Toneladas da material diamantífero extraídas y tratadas = 39 millones

Quilates obtenidos = 9 millones

Costo global = 232 millones de Bs.

Proporción Talla - Industrial - Sort

La lines divisoria entre talla e industrial as a veces arbitraris y no absolute. Generalmente al diamente propio para is talla se caracteriza asi:

- está bien conformado
- es blanco o ligeramente coloreado
- pasa más de 1/20 quilates (10 mg.)

Son comunes en nuestros yacimientos unos diamantes triangulares (equilatérales de 2 a 3 mm de lado) llamados "panelas" clasificados como industriales pero que pueden aprovecharse para talla.

El bort, oscuro, sirve para hacer polvo de diamante.

De acuerdo a las estadísticas suministradas por el Ministerio; de Minas a, Hidrocarburos tenemos que la producción venezolana se distribuys en:

|            | 1969 | 1970 | (Guaniamo) |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| Talla      | 61%  | 25%  |            |
| Industrial | 30%  | 35%  |            |
| Bort       | 9%   | 40%  |            |

Comparado con resultados estadísticos - muy escasos por cierto de otras partes tenemos la siguiente comparación porcentual del diamante de Talla con respecto a la producción total

|                      | Proporción del tipo Talla |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Venezuela            | 25% (aluvión)             |
| Sierra Leone         | 60% (aluvión)             |
| Wersselton-Kimberley | 30% (pipe)                |
| Mir-Rusia            | 21% (pipe)                |
| Udachnaya-Rusia      | 12% (pips)                |

*   Forma

Característica morfológica que define al diamante de talla como un:

*   octaedro
*   rombo dodecaedro
*   cubo.
*   formas intermedissentre las 3 anteriores

La forma cúbica es la más rara; generalmente en Venezuela hallamos octaedros; muy semejantes a los de Sierra Leone y que aparecen en la hoja - DIAMANTE DE TALLA - DIFERENCIAS MORFOLOGICAS -

Siendo de origen aluvionario se puede apreciar que presentan aristas redondeadas y no nítidas, significativo de un posible arrastre hasta su lugar de extracción.

Los octaedros de "chimeneas" tienen aristas nítidas y perfectas (foto). En la operación de talla, el octaedro es el mas apropiado para la talla americana 6 full cut 6 corte clásico del brillante.

*   Estructura

Característica morfológica que corresponde al modo de cristalización de la piedra, observandose una de las dos particularidades siguientes:

*   estrías en las facetas 6
*   estratos en el cuerpo de la piedra

Generalmente nuestras pideras presentan estes capas é estratos, perfectamante observables al microscopio birccular, lo cual puede marecer un cuidado espegial en la operación talla.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 120

# Tamaño

Hasta donde setemas, los diamantes de Venezuela son mayormente pequeños. Exeminendo un lote al azar en operación de fiscalización
Guía No. 00112, observamos la distribución siguiente:

| mas de un quilate   | 24   piedras. |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| manos de un quilate | 1951          |
| Total               | 1975 piedras  |

Las piedras grandes son rarás - En 1970 fuá descubierta en el
Guanismo una piedra de 57,85 quilates, ( adquirida en el sitio
por 8s. 65.000 avaluada en 104.000. por el M.M.H. a los efectos
del Impuesto de explotación.)

En este aspecto el comercio ilícito hace errática toda investiga-
ción y salo se dispone tanto en Venezuela como en gran parte de
las áreas de producción de datos indicativos relativos al tamaño:
por eje: lo en Ghana es frecuente la piedra de más de 2 quilates;
en Dutcitspan - Sur Africa, el ritmo de aparición de piedras de
50 a 200 quilates es más frecuente que en cualquier otro sitio
(minas controladas por De Beers).

En los placeres aluvionales de playas del sur ceste africano las
piedras grandas se encuentran en la desembocadura del río Grange,
disminuyendo el tamaño a medida que se aleja uno de la desembocadura
(20 piedras/quilate a 200 millas de la desembocadura; explotación en
el mar)

# Color

El color es otra característica que se toma en cuenta en la avalua-
ción da la piedra bruta. En la pisdra tallada su importancia es menor
ya que el valor lo determinan en orden: las proporciones de las fa-
cetas, inclusiones, color y peso.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

La mayoría de los diamantes son coloreados

*   Venezuela Blanco amarillonto
*   Ghana marrón verdoso muy atractivo
*   Sur Africa generalmente vurdoso
*   Premier Mine marrón ligeramente aceitoso
*   Mir-Rusia Blanco
*   Sierra Leone blanco verdoso

Conclusión.-

El diamante de talla verezolano en términos generales, es un diamante de aluvión de buen tenor; octaedro bien conformado con estratos; pequeño; blanco amarillento.

¿Como se sitúa nuestro diamante con relación a los demás?
(pregunta formulada a negociantes y talladores de New York, Londres, Amberes e Israel)

La respuesta ha sido que no compiten con: Rusia, Africa del Sur Sierra Leone, Africa Central.

Compiten con: Brasil, Cuayana, Costa de Marfil y otros.

# 133.- Precios

## 1331.- Precio_del_diemante en la cina

Durante nuestra visita a las minas del Guaniamo en Octubre de 1970 homos presenciando numerosas transaciones comerciales entre mineros y compradores instalados éstos en el caserio El Candado, lugar surgido en medio de la selva a 200 kilometros al sur-ceste de Ciudad Bolivar con motivo de la "bulla" del Guaniamo.

Los precios practicados por los compradores, que por regla peneral actuan por cuenta de terceros, son variables y deporñuen de los factores siguientes:

- Del tipo de diamete

Generomente se distinguen las categorias siguientes:

*   Talla de primera F. 300/qt
*   Media talla F. 180 - 200/qt
*   Industrial F. 80 - 100/qt
*   "reyers" reject F. 50/qt
*   Bort F. 10/qt

El numero de clasificaciones puede alcanzar 8 y se observa que la finalidad que persigue el comprador es de devaluar el lote, mientras que a nivel de fiscalización por el M.M.H. en Ciudad Bolivar el aumento del mumero de clasificaciones - 11 (once)-tiene por objeto valorar el lote. No existen pués criterios unificados y_saría muy dificil adoptar la misma clasificación ya que al Ministerio llegan lotes rèclasificados.

-De las condiciones del mercado

Bajo este concepto podemos enumerer la afluencia de piedras, la experiencia del minero, las instrucciones impartidas desde Ciudad Bolivar, Caracas o el exterior a los compradores.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 128

- 29 -

De las condiciones de vida del minero

El Minero organizado en grupo de trabajo, tiene ingresos provenientes de:

*   una actividad diaria que rinde 6s 100 a Bs 500 semanales por persona.
*   una actividad de envergadura consistente en una explotación a mayor escala donde interviene la remoción de "grunas" o bloques de varies toneladas en una quebrada; la apertura de un "telin" o canal de desvío o corte de meandro; actividad que ocupa generalmente a cuatro o cinco mineros y que rinde por ejemplo 8s 20.000,00 en un mes al grupo de trabajo.

Los gastos de existencia del minero son por otro lado muy elevados debidos a las condiciones mismas del sistema de Libre Aprovechamiento o sea aislamiento, hostilidad del medio, etc.

Podemos ilustrar lo costoso de la vida con los precios siguientes:

*   un almuerzo (presa de pollo +arepa) Bs 10,00
*   un fresco Bs 3,00
*   una cerveza Bs 5,00
*   un kilo da cambures Bs 6,00
*   periódico Bs 2,00
*   pasaje en helicóptero para un vuelo de 5 minutos aproximadamente (aquivalentes a trayecto caminado en 6 horas) Bs 100,00

Por lo expuesto podemos ver que el minero necesita un nivel aceptable de ingresos para hacer frente al alto costo de la vida que impone el medio, viéndose obligado en esas condiciones a aceptar los precios que se ofrecen por la producción encontrada.

En conclusión la explotación bajo el sistema de libre aprovechamiento hace difícil la determinación de las costos unitarios de producción, los márgenes de utilidad entre intermediarios y en general toda evaluación racional de tipo económico, incluyendo la producción misma.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

## 1332.- Precios a los efectos de liquidación del Impuesto de Explotación.

La Ley de Minas admite que el imcussto de explotación de 35 an el casa del libre aprovechamiento, saa cancelado por el comprsice n caso de quael minero no pudiera hacerlo. La liquidación de asa impuesto tiene lugar en Ciudad Salivas y es generalmente un mayorista que centraliza los diamantes provenientes de varios compreceres el que presenta una solicitud de liquidación según el models anexa. Es de hacer notar que el mayorista sslacciona las piedras en Casa a una clasificación impuesta por la fiscalía y que en ninguna manera corresponda a la clasificación adoptada en el momento da la ccmpra en el sitio de explotación.

En base a la solicitud de liquidación al M.M.H. comprueba el valor declarado y generalmente aumenta dicho valor en un porcentaja muy razonable sobre el lote total: 2 a 5% según su composición - La - planilla de liquidación es la que sirva a los efectos de la cancelación en las oficinas del Banco de Venezuela que actúa como receptor de fondos nacionales.

En base as planillas señaladas apuntamos los precios siguientes en bolivares:

(Utilidad teórica)

1333.-Progresión del nivel de precios.-

Es difícil establecer la ganancia de los intermediarios.

Se puede aceptor una utilidad de 5% por participante - es decir -
que dosde el minero hasta el mayorista exportador (dos o tres in-
termediarios) el precio de una piedra aumentaría en un 10 6 15%,
lo qua no parece excesivo.

Son excepcionales las variaciones mayores: del estudio del regis-
tro de ventas de los compradores que tienen actualizada su situa-
ción en la fiscalía del Ministerio de Minas en Ciudad Bolívar, se
pudo ver por ejemplo que en Mayo de 1970 el Sr. Ramón Peña vendió
al Sr. Visnel Alvarez en Bs. 9.000,00 un lote adquirida en Bs.
6.800,00 6 ses realizando una ganancia de 30%. Normalmente este már
gen oscila entre 4 y 7%.

En verdad, a través del circuito se opera una selección de las pie-
dras que trae como consecuencia un aumento en el valor de los lotes.

Esto lo apreciamos en el ejemplo del IVIC - Instituto Venezolano de
Investigaciones Científicas el cual adquiere diamante industrial
destinado a la fabricación de las cuchillas de diamante, siendo pig.
dras escogidas.

De cualquier manera, puede apreciarse que los exportadores de dia -
mantes aún haciendo una ligera utilidad de 5% en cada operación, da
do que ésta se repite muchas veces a lo largo del año, hacen un al-
to beneficio, proporcional a la rotación de su capital durante el
perioco.

# 14. Aprovechamiento del Diamante en Venezuela.

Dal total de diamantes producida en Venezuela (en 1970 508.000,00 quilates) es infima la parte aprovechada en el País.

En lo que se refiere al diamants de talla existen unos peces talleres que en pequeña escala trabajan le talla del diamante. Tenemos el ejemplo en Ciudad Bolivar dal Taller Caroni, con S personas donde se talla aproximadamente 400 quiletes por año, sagún información recabada en el Tallas mismo. Existen otros talleres an Puerto Ordaz, Caracas y la Colonis Tovar.

Se ha estimado que actualmente no excede de 2.000,00 quilatas por año la talla del diamante en Venezusla.

El Gobierno Regional en el Estado Solívar está impulsando el establecimiento de una escuela de talla en Ciudad Bolívar, habiendo ordenado ya los equipos necesarics. Esta actividad merece toda el apoyo gubernamental con miras a desarrollar en Venezuela los equipos humanos para que estos puedan competir en el Mercado Internacional al cabo de unos años, una vez adquirida la experiencia nocesario, lograda en otros paises en varias generaciones.

Hay que estar conscientes que la talla del diamante es una actividad altamente especializada y compatida en Estados Unidos, Europa a Israel. Por ejemplo en este último país existen 12.000 tallsdoras que devengan en promedio sueldos mensuales de 900,co Ss., determinando esto un costo reducido de talla.

En Israal tuvimos la oportunidad de visitar los Talleres Garik qua producen mensualmonte 5.000 quilates tallados, variando los costes de la talla entre 15,50 $ y 27,60 $ por quilate.

Con respecto al diamante industrial, cca excepción del Institute Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientifices, practicamante no existe el aprovechamiento de este tipo de diamante. El IVIC aprovecha aproximadamente 200 quilates al año, como se detalla en ficha anexa.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

# Ejemplo.- Aprovechamiento del Diamante Industrial.-
Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificos..

El IVIC utiliza el diamante industrial nacional para la fabricación
do la cuchillas de diamantes, para cortes ultrafinos, según técnica
desarrollada por el Cientifico Venezolano Dr. Humberto Fernández M.

Precio de compra del diamante y circuita del mismo.-

El IVIC aprovecha anualmente 200 quilates de diamantes reselecciona
dos de tipa industrial, por el cual paga a razón de 80,00 us quila
te:.

El circuito de adquisición de estos diamantes es:

Minero Comprador de Campo (empleado del mayorista)

Mayorista de Ciudad Bolivar Mayorista Exportador
de Caracas IVIC

Mercado Externo..

Con diamantes de buenas dimensiones y peso inferior a 1 quilate el
IVIC fabrica las cuchillas para microtomo de primera calidad las -
cuales factura así:

*   Cuchilla de 2 mm. de ancho, más soporte 120,00 dólares
*   Cada 0,1 mm. adicionales 20,00 dólares

El quilate de diamante de este tipo ha sido pagado al minero a razón
de 50,00 6s/quilate. (diamante de primera, panelas), según se despren
de de las planillas de declaración del mayorista de Ciudad Bolívar, -
valor aceptado por el Ministerio da Minas.

Adquiriendo el diamante a 80,co Bs/Qt. observamos que hay una diferen
cia de 30,00 F/Qt. que viene siendo la utilidad de los intermediarios
esta ganancia no puede considerarse excesiva, máxime tomando en cuen-
ta la selección de la piedra, pero al cabo de un año de negocic de es
ta naturaleza el intermediario puede llegar a un rendimiento de 200 %
sobre su capital dependiendo de la fracuencia con la cual su capital
sea rctado.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

Ejemplo.- Valorización de la piedra al tallarla.-

Durante el transcurso del estudio se pudieron adservar varies opera- cicnss de avalúa efectuades en el laboratorio da gumología del MMH - Ciudad Bolívar, a petición de compradores interssados en conocer el valor de una sortija personal.

El 15/10/70 sa efectuó la sxperticia de una piedra presentada por - el Sr. Splendiani de color amarillento, con un paso dc 6,27 quilates (peso estimado con tabla "Weight Calculator" ya que la piedra estaba mantada en sortija).

En la operación de evalúo se toman en cuenta por orden de importan - cia:

1.- Las proporciones de la piedra tallada (lupa y microscopic)

2.- La existencia de inclusiones, carbones y accidentes dentro de le piedra (microscopio)

3.- El color

4.- El paso

La piedra en cuestión fue evaluada en 24.000,00 S. (da haber tenido mejor color hubiera podido alcanzar 6s. 120.000,00)

En la operación de talla el rendimiento es de 50% aproximadamente, o sea que la piedra bruta debió pesar 13 quilates aproximadamente.

El costo de la talla as 8s. 100,00 el quilate a sea que en esto caso costó 5s. 1.300,00

Tomando en cuenta el tamaño y calidad de esta piedra, el valor en el sitio da explotación es de Bs. 10000,00, como máximo, haciendo notar que según la especificación del MMH en la fiscalización habría sido evaluada en un mínimo de es. 4.140,00.

Puede apreciarse en consecuencia la valorización habida por la piedra en el proceso de talla pasando desde aproximadamente 8s. 12.000,00 - revendida por los intermediarios hasta 2s. 24.000,co evaluación dal gamólogo.

OTRAS RECOMENDACIONES

Las recomendaciones que a continuación hacemos guardan relación - directa, aunque no aparente, con el objeto mismo de nuestro estudio y estan destinadas a corregir, completer o reconsiderar algunos aspectos de la actividad diamantifera en Vanezuela.

Algunas da las recomendaciones no conciernen directamente al Ministerio de Minas e Hidrocarburos.

## Liquidación Impuesto Explotación

Sería recomendable estudiar fórmulas que permitan agilizar los trámites y la propia operación de fiscalización sin restarla su debida importancia.

Se ha pensado que ea podría contemplar a partir de un estudio estadístico amplio una liquidación en base al peso de los lotes o sea - bolívares por quilate sin entrar a considerar calidades.

En efecto si existen 2.500 calidades de piedras, ¿porque entrar a considerar 8 clasificaciones dentro del diamante de taila?, ademas no es raro que la talla malogre la piedra por cambio de color, rotura etc. quedando el concepto de calidad sin fundamento.

El estudio estadístico sobre un gran número de lotes con distinción de Talla - Industrial-Ecrt, permitiríe establecer 3 valores que equivaldrimal actual 3% percibido sobre el valor del lote 6 posiblemen- te superior al 3%.

Concretamente, suponiendo que el cuadro de producción para el año -- 1970 sea un cuadro standard, observamce lo siguiente (Litre Aprovechamiento).

| Talla      | 131.106,42 | qts |
| ---------- | ---------- | --- |
| Industrial | 172.650,77 | qts |
| Eort       | 234.983,85 | qts |
| Total      | 503.661.04 | qts |

Valor para el impuesto 26.217.073.60 Bs.

Impuesto. pagado 800.597,42 Bs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

- 76 -

Si se adoptan valores do referencio tales que permitan gravar el pro
cucto en la forma siguiente

|            |             |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Talla      | 5 Bs/qt.    |
| Industrial | 1 Bs/qt.    |
| Sort       | 0,25 Bs/qt. |

Obtenemos el cuadro de liquidación siguiente:

|                              |                   |                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Talla                        | 131.106,42 x 5    | = Bs. 655.532,10   |
| Industrial                   | 172.650,77 x 1    | = Bs. 172.650,77   |
| Sort                         | 204.983,80 x 0,25 | = Bs. 51.246,00    |
| **Total Impuesto liquidado** |                   | **Bs. 879.428,87** |

Licencias de Compradores

En vista de que las 2/3 partes de los compradores con licencia no cum
plen con la Ley, sería conveniente reconsiderar el modo de otorgamien
to de dichas licencias.

Ministerio de Hacienda

De acuerdo a la Ley, Artículo 144, las Administraciones de Aduane deben
enviar copia de los Manifiestos de Exportación de Diamentos al ΜΜΗ. ΕΞ
to no se cumple. El 5 de Junio de 1954 mediante oficio No. 5903 MMH -
pidió al Ministerio de Hacienda el cumplimiento de dicho artículo. Se-
ría conveniente reiterer la solicitud.

Control de Lotes da Diamantes en las Aduanas

Parece irrisorio que on las Aduanes de la República no se controle el
contenido de las cajitas con diamantes on bruto que se exportan, y
cuando se hace como es el ceso en Ciudad Bolívar, so coloque el paque
te que puede peser bruto 100 gramos o menos sobre una balanza TOLEDO,
que sirve para pesar bultos de hesta 250 Kilos.

Se recomienda utilizar une balenza adecuada, y lacrar los paquetes pa
ra evitar el cambio de su composición.

Disposiciones Arancelarias

Las cifres de importación relativas a piedras preciosas o semi precio-
sas, recopiladas por la Dirección General de Estadísticas dal Minis-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 136

- 77 -

teria de Fomento son prácticamente inutilizables.

Se debería precisar en el Arancel de Aduanas las preciosas y las semi
preciosas; y dentro de las primeras si se trata de brillantes, esme-
raldas, rubis, zafiros u otros. El actual Azancel mezcla los varios -
conceptos.

Recomendaciones de interés industrial

A.- Se recomienda avaluar la riqueza de los materiales ya explotados
en los placeres de San Salvador de Paúl, con miras al aprovecha-
miento industrial del diamante-eventualmente mediante licitación
pública-ya que ensayos privados han demostrado la posibilidad de
recuperar aproximadamente cien dólares en diamantes por metro
cúbico.

8.- Se recomienda considerar la posibilidad de aprovechar a mayor -
escala, la experiencia del IVIC en materia de fabricación de cu-
chillas de diamante para microtomo; experiencia que a través de
doce años le ha válido al IVIC en el exterior un gran prestigio.

15. CIFENCE-4 is currently assigned to the section of CIRAGE with basic responsibility for guerrilla activity. As a result he is required to spend between 50 and 75 percent of his time outside of Caracas. While this has made him somewhat less accessible to the Station, he is well placed to obtain advance information, with regard to possible plans for urban violence or kidnappings, high on the list of Station priorities. He has contributed to two reports during the period. A change in the Minister of Interior has recently been announced, which could result in changes down to the level of CIFENCE-4, especially should CIFENCE-1 leave his position. In the meantime, CIFENCE-4 continues as a valuable Station penetration of CIRASH.

CIFLUTE
July
Operational Report for Period XXXNXXXXthrough December 1971

5. CIFENCE-4 has been handled since August 1971 by Edgar B. MARTEXIANI. It was decided for security reasons to take this agent out of the goup of agents handled by the Station Officer conducting liaison, and CIFENCE-A is thus handled as a truly unilateral penetration of CIRASH. During the reporting period allegations arose as to affiliation of CIFENCE-4 with JKLANCE. (See WH/Miami 12203 and Caracas 17730). The Station is avare of this situation and the agent is handled accordingly. CIFENCE-4 successfully passed his ump-teenth ECSWIRL examination on 3 October 1971 and the Station's opinion of this individual continues to be favorable. (See HVCW-9612 for SGSWIRL results). As an indication of the continuing high esteen enjoyed by CTFENCE-4 within the GOV, he was chosen by CIFENCE-1 to accompany the present Venezuelan Minister of the Interior on a month long European vacation in September 1971. It is widely acknowledged that the Minister of the Interior is the leading candidate for the COPEI presidential nomination; should this occur and he be elected the next president of Venesuela, CIFENCE-4 should have a valuable friend. In summation, the Station continues to regard CIFENCE-4 as a valuable Station asset who has an excellent reputation within CIRASH and the GOV. He contributed to two intelligence reports during the reporting period, but his value to the Station lies primarily in operational reporting and his status as a unilateral penetration not known to be in contact with JKLANCE in any vay.

COMMENTS RS DEROGATORY TRACES
ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

1.  A POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his
    use as a penetration of Venezuelan General Directorate of
    Police. Cancellation was requested in February 1968 because
    of indications that Subject was involved in "clandestine sabotage
    activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi-
    ties to CIA. Thereafter, Subject was treated as a "hostile".
    In the ensuing months Subject was described as "an extremely
    valuable penetration" because of his important and accurate
    Intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was
    given a polygraph examination to clear up questions about pos-
    sible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-
    tion with gangster elements, etc. His responses showed no
    information which would prevent CIA using him for ops purposes.
    Request for POA was again requested on 7 September 1968. This
    POA request was turned down on 15 October due to Subject being
    an "agent of a foreign power."

2.  Since that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
    and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
    sive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
    etc. Subject continues to report accurately and often and has
    a very pro-U.S. attitude. Subject was again polygraphed on
    29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's
    CI/OA folder). His responses indicated no deception concern-
    ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
    U.8. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms
    dealings, etc.

TO : WH/3 29 November 1971

FROM : Interrogation Research Division IRD# 72501

SUBJECT: CIFFNCF/4

BACKGROUND:

Subject, CIFENCE/4, is a 43-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A who has been of continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact. He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK as does his wife. He was last SGSWIRLed on 23 May 1968 with favorable results. Subject claimed that during service with IDEN B and previous service with JKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLed and estimated the total number of SGSWIRLs he has had at twelve to fifteen.

PROCEDURE:

On 3 November 1971, CIFENCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert site in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilized in discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case Officer, Edgar B. MARTEGANI, served as interpreter. During the SGSWIRL, the English language was used. The undersigned was introduced as Mr. Bob MOUNT from WOCORK.

PURPOSE:

The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar E. MARTEGANI to determine whether Subject knows if any member of IDEN D and specifically if IDEN E is aware or suspects his current JKLANCE connections; if he has been requested to work against LNLUTE; if since May 1968 he has been in contact with or heard about IDEN F or IDEN G; if since May 1968 Subject has been involved in illegal arms smuggling. Specific questions utilized during the SCSWIRL are given later in this report.

CONCLUSION:

There were no unresolved reactions indicative of deception. It is the opinion of the undersigned that Subject answered all questions truth-

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

SECRET

IRD 72501
Page 2
29 November 1971

fully. Apparently Subject is unaware of any compromise of his LNLUTE connections; has been truthful in his reports to JKLANCE; has not been involved in any illegal arms dealings other than smuggling weapons into IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of IDEN D and related organizations; has not been asked to work against LNLUTE and has received no information from or about IDEN F or IDEN G.

## DETAILS:

Subject was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses. He seemed open and frank in response to all queries. Subject exhibited a response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDEN G. Discussion of the issue elicited the information that Subject had received some information concerning a son of one of these individuals. He also mentioned that on a trip to IDEN H a few years ago he had spoken by telephone to IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDFN G. Subject also showed a response to the question concerning illegal arms dealing. He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought back pistols, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun. These weapons were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E or members of IDEN D. He stated that the weapons were brought in illegally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own use) was illegal. Specific questions concerning these arms dealings were asked. Based on the sessions results, it appears that while Subject has smuggled arıns into IDFN A and possesses illegal arms, he has not been involved in smuggling large amounts of arms for personal profit or engaged since May 1968 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN Α.

Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:

Were you born in IDEN J? Yes

Did you reside in WOCORK? Yes.

Are you concealing the identity of anyone who knows you work for JKLANCE? No

# CIFENCE-4

CIFENCE-4 continued to be a reliable, steady Station asset who continues to be one of CIFENCE-1's closest and most trusted associates. CIFENCE-1 has a great deal of confidence in CIVENCE-4 and always assigns him the most difficult jobs which he feels none of his other employees can handle. During a great deal of this reporting period, CIFENCE-4 was out of Venezuela on special missions for CIFENCE-1. He travelled to Lima, Peru to send a bomb which would not explode to the home of Peres Jimenes, went to Curacao to conduct a special investigation and spent considerable time on the Colombian border. He contributed to two disseminated intelligence reports dealing with military intelligence about Colombian activities collected by a Venezuelan security service and the reported presence of eleven Venezuelan fishing boats and one warship in Colombian territorial waters. CIFENCE-1 has appointed CIFENCE-4 chief of the division of CIRASH

continued....

which is responsible for coordinating all of the activities of the CIRASH offices located outside Caracas. Such a position should offer CIFENCE-4 access to various types of information and targets of interest to JKLANCE. As was said in the last CIFLUTE operational report, the Station continues to think very highly of CIFENCE-4 and looks forward to a continuing productive relationship with him.

3. CIFENCE-4

CIFENCE-4 continued to be a reliable, steady Station asset who enjoys the confidence of and has a very close working relationship with CIFENCE-1. During most of the reporting period, he was in charge of the surveillance of the newly arrived Soviet diplomats and was quick to pass to the Station any information coming into his possession which he felt would be of value to JKLANCE. Because most of his time was devoted to coverage of the Soviets, he was unable to give the Station the large variety and number of reports which in the past has been his custom. The Station continues to think very highly of CIFENCE-4 and looks forward to a continuing productive relationship with him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 196

4. CIFENCE-4

CIFENCE-4 continues to be a reliable and steady Station asset who enjoys the confidence of and has a very close workine relationship with CIFENCE-1. His recent acquisition of Venezuelan citizenship has increased his stature with CIFENCE-1 and among the Venezuelans with whom he works. He continues on his own to provide information coming into his possession which he feels will be of interest to JKLANCE and also continues to pass to the Station numerous reports from CIFENCE and other security- intelligence agencies. Ilis most valuable contribution during this reporting period was the information indicating that a CIFENCE officer had information which could have led to the discovery by CIFENCE of the Station's CIGRAPE operation. CIFENCE-4 was able to convince this officer in a very discreet, innocuous manner that the information was of no value and should not be brought to the attention of CIFENCE-1. The officer was convinced, and no investigation was conducted. In the meantime, the Station completely disbanded the CIGRAPE operation. At each meeting with his Case Officer, CIFENCE-4 is asked if there is anything new in regard to this case and he has replied there are no new developments and feels the issue is a dead one. The Station feels the original information from CIFENCE-4 is the type that really proves the value of a good asset. Interesting documents provided by CIFENCE-4 during this reporting period Include a list of all personnel working in Venezuelan diplomatic missions abroad, a CIFENCE report about the investigation of the purchase of arms in Miami by unknown elements in the Venezuelan Ministry of Defense, a package containing several documents fron CIFENCE and other sources about Communist activities in Venezuela, a report dealing with possible conspiring against the GOV by Venezuelan military officers, a list of various subversive organizations located in several different countries, a report about the possible presence in Venezuela of Colonel Caamano Deno,

![photo of handwritten "-201- CIFENCE-LI" and "1978"]

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

a report about the reorganization of CIFENCE, a list identifying automobile license plates used by foreign diplomats in Venezuela, a list of personnel employed by CIRASH, a key to the communications code used by CIRASH, the CIFENCE report about the surveillance of YEBALM during his most recent trip to Caracas and copies of CIFENCE reports about the surveillance of the first two Soviet diplomats now in Caracas. In addition, CIFENCE-4 has conducted name traces and identified automobile license plates for the Station and soon will provide unidentifiable license plates for use by the Station on vehicles rented for surveillance and other operational needs.

CIFENCE-4 is chief of the operations section of CIFENCE and, as such, has responsibility for surveillance of Soviet and Bloc personnel in Venezuela. Through piw, the Station has the means of monitoring quite closely the movements and activities of these persons. Also, we are able, to direct CIFENCE-4 to conduct special surveillances of Soviet and Bloc person who may not be under surveillance by CIFENCE as a routine procedure. The current position of CIFENCE-4 within CIFENCE is very good and should remain so as long as CIFENCE-1 remains as head of CIFENCE. CIFENCE-4 feels there is a good possiblity that if CIFENCE-1 leaves his present position he (CIFENCE-4) will be removed from CIFENCE. Should this happen, the Station will lose access to an important position within CIPENCP and CIFENCE-4will lose his principal source of income. CIFENCE-4 has said several times he would like to have a career with JKLANCE. and would be willing to work in any country of the world for us. If CIFENCE-4 eventually loses his position within CIFENCE and is unable to obtain another position in Venezuela that would provide access of interest to JKLANCE, Headquarters may wish to consider using him in some other country.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 197

See HVCA 17828, 26 October 70, re CIFENCE belief that CIGRAFE/2 is working. was told to for CIA. CIFENCE/4 advised the station of this, and will do what he can to initiate a full-scale CIFENCE investigation of CIGRAPE/2, under his own direction, in order to remove the suspicions. He said it would be hard to do this without attracting undue interest, but he will remain alert to the problem and try to take charge of any investigation that may get under way.

SUBJECT: CIFLUTE/CIFENCE
Possible Future Contact with CIFENCE-4

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

REF: HVCA-17611, 14 May 1970

A.R.: Paragraphs 2 and 3 below:

1. I appreciate Caracas' offer for possible future contact with CIFENCE-4 in the event of another emergency situation in Trinidad, a possibility which should not be totally ruled out. I was aware that four or five Venezuelan officials had arrived in Port of Spain shortly after the declaration of a state of emergency, but I had no contact with any of these individuals during their stay here.

2. I agree with CIFENCE-4 that it would have been to the station's advantage to have had contact with him during the period of the Regiment mutiny. To this end, I propose the following contact arrangements. When CIFENCE-4 has arrived in Port of Spain and has gotten himself set up, he should call Identity A on Identity B during normal office hours (0800-1700). One hour after telephonic contact has been made with Identity A, CIFENCE-4 will be picked up in Identity C at Identity D. In order to establish bona fides, the case officer will ask of CIFENCE-4 "Are you a friend of Pedro's?". CIFENCE-4 should respond "Yes, and of Tomas also.". Recognition signals having been exchanged and authenticated, I would feel free to ask CIFENCE-4 to keep me informed of developments from his side as they occurred.

3. Please provide a physical description of CIFENCE-4.

CIPUTE/CIFENCE - Recent Trip to Trinidad of CIFENCE-4

## ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required: As Stated Herein

1.  CIFENCE-4 (IDENTITY under separate cover for Port of Spain), an agent of the Caracas Station, was in Port of Spain during the periods 21-22 April 1970 and 24 April - 3 May 1970. CIFENCE-4 said the purpose of his trip vas to protect Venesuelans in Trinidad and to collect information about the situation in Trinided for the Government of Venezuela. He gave the Caracas Station a copy of the report he prepared for the Venesuelan Government about his activities in Trinidad. A copy of this report is being sent under separate cover to Port of Spain for the information of the Station only.

2.  CIFENCE-4 said it was too bad he had no contact with JKLANCE while in Trinidad, as he feels he could have provided timely on-the-spot informatica. If a situation in Trinidad similar to the previous cme again arises, CIFENCE-4 feels he may have to return to Trinidad. If this happens, he is willing to have contact with JKIANCE it so desired. The Port of Spain Station is requested to advise the Caracas Station if this contact vould be desired and, if so, to sand Caracas a contact plan. Upon receipt of this plan, Caracas vill advise the name and recognition signal CIFENCE-4 vill use. CIFENCE-4 speaks fairly good English, so there should be no language barrier in communicating with him.

operations smoother. Unfortunately, CHIMURON-1's men are already planning a roarguard action to make CIFENCE-3's job as difficult as possible. The net result of this switch, however, has been to somewhat increase efficiency of the two services and to materially increase JKLANCE unilateral access to each. For awhile, this reorganization will be beneficial, but-because of the personalities of CIRASH-17 and CIFENCE-1-we do not expect either CIHURON-1 or CIFENCE-3 to indefinitely have smooth sailing.

2. CIFENCE-4

CIFENCE-4 provided verbal and written information reports about various subjects of interest such as activities of Communist and other subversive elements, guerrilla activities, counterfeiting of money and documents, sabotage, information about and activities of Soviets visiting Venezuela, kidnappings of well-known persons in Venezuela, CIFENCE operations and internal problems of CIFENCE. His position in CIFENCE as Chief of Operations provides him access to practically all written reports and documents prepared and received by CIFENCE. His daring as a dedicated agent for JKLANCE has enabled him to provide the Station with copies of several of these reports and documents. During this reporting period he has provided 119 copies of such reports and documents.

Some of the more significant requests levied on CIFENCE-4 during this reporting period include the following: 1) assessment for the Station's SB Section of an employee of the Venezuelan Government's Oficina Central de Informaciones (OCI), 2) for the SB and CP Sections of the Station, collection of information about and assessment of a former employee of the local TASS office in Caracas, 3) provision for the SB Section of a list of the names and license plate numbers of the users of all diplomatic automobile license plates in Venezuela, 4) investigation for the Station's CP Section of the robbery of a large sum of money reportedly destined for financing the clandestine manufacture of arms, and 5) for the Station's Case Officer in charge of student operations, collection of information about and assessment of a former Station asset in whom there is a renewed operational interest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

SECRET

CIFENCE-4's current Casa Officer is Gordon K. RIJOCK who meets with CIFENCE-4 in safehouse number 45 which was obtained during this reporting period. When RIJOCK wants to schedule a meeting with CIFENCE-4, RIJOCK's wife who speaks native Spanish with no American accent, telephones CIFENCE-4's home, identifies herself as "Maria" and asks to speak with the true first name of CIFENCE-4. If CIFENCE-4 is at home, RIJOCK's wife tells him she wants to meet with him at a certain time on a certain date at "the usual place" (which means the safehouse) and asks if the time and date are acceptable to him. If CIFENCE-4 says yes, RIJOCK meets with him at the safehouse. If he says no, RIJOCK's wife asks him to set a time and date. If these are acceptable to RIJOCK, the meeting is thereby scheduled and held. If RIJOCK wants CIFENCE-4 to pick him up in his auto-mobile, "Maria" says she wants to meet him at a certain time on a certain date "at the location near my home". If the time and date are acceptable to CIFENCE-4, RIJOCK then walks to a site a few blocks from his home where CIFENCE-4 picks him up in his private automobile. If the time and date are not acceptable to CIFENCE-4, then "Maria" asks CIFENCE-4 to set a new time and date which, if acceptable to RUJOCK, serve as the schedule for the car pickup meeting. If CIFENCE-4 is not home, "Maria" requests that CIENCE-4 telephone "Maria" as soon as possible. Upon returning to his home and receiving the message, CIFENCE-4 telephones RIJOCK's home from a public telephone, identifies himself as "Raul" and asks to speak to "Roberto". If RIJOCK is home, he and CIFENCE-4 talk directly and arrange a meeting. If RIJOCK is not home, CIFENCE-4 says "Raul" is calling and either he wants "Roberto" to contact him or he will call "Roberto" later. If the message is for "Roberto" to call him, then "Maria" telephones CIFENCE-4's home and follows the procedure described above. (NOTE: RIJOCK'S wife makes all telephonic contact with CIFENCE-4's home, to give the impression to anyone monitoring CIFENCE-4's telephone that a native Spanish speaking "girlfriend" of CIFENCE-4 wants to talk with him.

In the event RIJOCK wishes to contact CIFENCE-4 while he is in his office, "Maria" telephones CIFENCE-4's wife, identifies herself as "Maria", says she wishes to speak with the true name of CIFENCE-4 and asks his wife to tell him to call her at a certain time. CIFENCE-4's wife then telephones him in his office and gives him the message from "Maria". If the time is acceptable to CIFENCE-4, he telephones RIJOCK's home from a public telephone and either arranges a meeting schedule with "Maria" (per prior instructions from RIJCCK) or speaks directly with RIJOCK to

arrange a meeting. If the time is not acceptable to CIFENCE-4, he gives a new time to his wife who immediately thereafter conveys the new time via telephone to "Maria" who in turn conveys it to RIJCC:. If CIFENCE-4 is not in his office, his wife leaves a message for him to call her as soon as possible. In such a case, his wife advises "Maria" that he is not in his office but when he calls her, she will tell him to call "Maria" as soon as possible. A meeting is scheduled when CIFENCE-4 calls and talks to either "Maria" or RIJOCK. If it is urgent for RIJOCK to talk to CIFENCE-4 as soon as possible, CIFENCE-4's wife tells CIFENCE-4 that "Maria" wants to speak to him as soon as possible. If an emergency situation necessitated immediate contact with CIFENCE-4 in his office and his wife was not available to telephone him, "Maria" would telephone him in his office.

In the event RIJOCK and/or CIFENCE-4 do not want to meet in the safehouse and do not want a car pickup at the site agreed upon, a new site is agreed upon during the course of the telephonic contacts described above. For future use, CIFERICE-4 and RIJOCK will make a list of primary and alternate meeting sites and assign numbers to each site selected. During telephonic contacts to establish meetings, only numbers will be used to designate the location of the meetings.

CIFENCE-4 and RIJOCK will discuss and prepare plans for contact under emergency/contingency conditions and for emergency re-contact. These plans will be forwarded to Headquarters as soon as they have been prepared.

SRAC is not used or contemplated for contacts with CIFELICE-4.

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence concerning this case.

2. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, by letter dated 16 April 1970, has granted the benefits of Section 316(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to cover the subject's absence from the United States from 20 March 1970, to an indefinite period, thereafter, and so long as he remains absent on behalf of the United States Government, with the understanding that he will prove to the satisfaction of the Naturalization Court when he files a Petition for United States Citizenship, five years after entry for permanent residence, that he has been absent during this period for that purpose. The benefits of this Section of the Act also permit subject to count the period of his absence toward both the residence and physical presence requirements for naturalization, provided that, since becoming a permanent resident of the United States and before applying for naturalization, he has completed an uninterrupted period of one year of physical presence in the United States.

3. The letter is being retained in the files of this Office and it is requested you so advise Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Alien Affairs Staff, Office of Security

ATTENTION : Mr. John Rooney

SUBJECT : Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles (201-300985)

REFERENCE : Caracas 4018 (IN 87480) copy attached

1. Caracas Station has requested Headquarters assistance in resolving as quickly as possible a citizen- ship question concerning Subject. In view of Subject's operational importance to the Station we would appreciate any effort your office could make to obtain a favorable decision in this matter.

2. Subject is an employee of the Directorate for Intelligence and Prevention (DISIP) which is the successor organization to the Directorate General of Police (DIGEPOLO). As the Station Caracas penetration of this organization, Subject holds a key position and is able to monitor intelligence operations conducted by DISIP as well as internal Venezuelan political matters. In this position, Subject is a highly valued asset of the Station. For this reason, the Station desires that his operational position be protected and, at the same time, his future as a U.S. Citizen not be jeopardized.

3. Since Subject actually obtained his own job through a friend in DISIP and made his own travel arrange- ments, the file does not reflect what type of documentation he has other that an expired reentry permit mentioned in the reference. A biographic data sheet is attached which gives the main points in Subject's background including his U.S. military service.

4. The primary concern at this point is whether accepting Venezuelan citizenship for operational reasons will destroy or jeopardize in any way, Subject's plans to become a U.S.

ar donde HARD tendría que renovar su licencia de piloto.
Posteriormente me entrevisté con el Sr. , cuya dirección es 7211 S. , su teléfono es el 5021995. La entrevista fue realizada en el Hotel Columbus en Miami el 21-10-69 a 10:00 a.m. El Sr. DD manifiesta que él tuvo una conversación con HARD y había quedado en proyecto la compra de un número indeterminado de armas de guerra. Según DD WITT, la compra de dichas armas la realizaría a
alrededor de la segunda quincena de Octubre, por lo cual ellos (STANLEY y DE WITT ) lo estarían esperando.
El Sr. DE WITT manifestó que HARD, compraría armas y equipos de guerra por una suma superior a $ 1'000000 (un millón de dólares) y que él en representación de HARD estaría dispuesto a vender la información de toda la transacción en un millón de dólares. La información según DD WITT, consiste en dar los nombres de las personas involucradas en la transacción (algunos viviendo en Miami) y entregar toda la información concerniente a la compra y traslado de las armas.
Como me pareció absurda la solicitud de un millón de dólares por una información lo hice observar a DD WITT, indicando que no había ningún traficante clandestino de armas capaz de suministrar esa cantidad y segundo que al Gobierno de Venezuela, no le interesaba pagar una cantidad semejante por esa información. Quedamos en que en caso que HARD volviera por Miami o hiciera contactos con él, él nos avisaría, llamando al Cónsul de VENEZUELA en MIAMI y trataríamos de nuevo sobre este asunto.

OBSERVACIÓN:

-- Es indiscutible que HARD haya entrado en comunicación con HARD y STANLEY para la compra de armas.

-- Para la compra de cantidades de armas en el mercado clandestino es necesario ver a varios traficantes..

-- Los grandes traficantes de armas en los Estados Unidos se encuentran en New Jersey, N.Y.

1.  The attached outline was taken from a confessed guerrilla, recently arrested by CIRASIH in the city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. When interrogated by AMCLEVE-15 and others, the arrestee said he did not know where the outline came from; what language it was in; and, in fact, said it did not belong to him.

2.  Various Station officers and assets have studied the outline, and the consensus of opinion is that it is probably Turkish or a middle-eastern language.

3.  It is requested that Headquarters contact the appropriate offices in an attempt to ascertain what language the outline is written in, together with a translation of its contents. Although Station personnel contacted felt it unlikely, the possibility exists that the outline is in code.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/OPS

SUBJECT : AMCLEVE-15 (201-300985)

1. Subject, à Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela, is a Station Caracas, penetration of the Venezuelan General Directorate of Police and of the Special Group, a smaller, somewhat autonomous unit within DIGEPOL. A POA was requested on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above. On 1 February 1967, WH/3/V requested cancellation of the POA request because of indications that Subject was involved in clandestine sabotage activity and there were suspicions that he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIGEPOL. Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile." The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with Subject as a source of information on activities of DIGEPOL and the Special Group but that no requirements were to be levied on him. The Station was advised that they could make spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.

2. The Station acknowledged their instructions but demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of ANCLEVE-15'8 activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con- trol and who seldom disclose the complete range of their activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they vere interested in Subject because of his position as a "trusted confidant" of certain highly placed Venezuelan security officials.

3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the intelligence information and operational reports he furnished. For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

as part of an infiltration scheme. He has reported such operational information as a description of the capabilities, layout and equipment of DIGEPOL telephone tap operations. Included in this information was his report that at least on paper, the U.S. Embassy was a target for tap operations. He has also reported on the personalities and workings of the organizations with which he is associated. At the same time the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved in a scheme to obtain "curare poison for approximately forty hypodermic needles." To avoid exposing the source of their information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involve-ment te wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-tions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this involvement with him.

4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and, further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of engaging in independent Cuban exile activity without informing his Case Officer. The Station also requested a polygraph exam-ination for Subject.

5. Subject was given a polygraph examination to resolve specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban Intelligence through relatives, unreported association with gangster elements, thefts from CIA and other questions involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject's responses, described as substantially truthful by the examiners, appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv-ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer, Lefty Rosenthal, did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, "...Ir fairness to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un-certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile arms supplies."

6. Station Caracas has requested that they be allowed to cease treating ANCLEVE-15 as a "hostile" and that the restrictions cited in Paragraph one, above, be lifted to permit more effective utilization of this well-placed penetration agent. WH Division concurs in this request. CI/OPS concurrence is requested in authorizing full operational use of AMCLEVE-15 as a penetration agent into the Venezuelan General Directorate of Police (DIGEPOL) and as a penetration of Rewberto UZCATEGUI's Special Group within DIGEPOL.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/OA

SUBJECT : AMCLEVE-15 (201-300985)

1. Subject, a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela, is a Station Caracas penetration of the Venezuelan General Directorate of Police and of the Special Group, a smaller, somewhat autonomous unit within DIGEPOL. A POA was requested on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above. On 1 February 1967, Wil/3/V requested cancellation of the POA request because of indications that Subject was involved in clandestine sabotage activity and there were suspicions that he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIGEPOL.

Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile". The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with Subject as a source of information on activities of DI GEFOL and the Special Group but that no requirements were to be levied on him. The Stetion was advised that they could make spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.

2. The Station acknowledged their instructions but demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of ANCLEVE-15'8 activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con- trol and who seldom disclose the complete range of their activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they were interested in Subject because of his position as a "trusted confidant" of certain highly placed Venezuelan security officials.

3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the intelligence information and operational reports he furnished. For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

On only one question, that involv- ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer, Lefty Rosenthal, did sensitivity persist.

MICROFILM

1. Attached are four copies of Subject's MOC.

2. As the Desk is aware, the last word from Headquarters vas that AMCLEVE-15 was to be treated as a "hostile" and that full clearance was being withheld pending his SGSWIRL. He has now been SGSWIRLed, and to the Station's knowledge, the test was favorable although an official Headquarters report has not been received. A PRQ Part I was submitted on Subject on 29 May 1968. Therefore, it would be appreciated if the Desk would contact the appropriate Headquarters officials and advise the Station of AMCLEVE-15's official status. We assume that he will be fully cleared and that a POA will be issued followed by an OA after the Station submits PRQ Part II.

3. Headquarters recently inquired as to Station thoughts on including AMCLEVE-15 in the CIFLUTE Project rather than making AMCLEVE a separate project. The Station is completely in accord with this idea although it will probably necessitate funds being shifted from CIGUSTY to CIFLUTE. However, a separate dispatch will be prepared on this subject.

4. The Station realizes that ANCIEVE-15's clearance has been a thorny problem to the Desk and hopes that we can now clear it up once and for all.

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: CUBAN DEFECTOR Operation
24
Briefing in Guatemala of Chief of state Peralta)

1.  The briefing was held in a small luxurious
    government conference room on the afternoon of Friday
    October 1964, lasting about 2 1/2 hours. (Chief of state 06.08.06.08.24.
    Colonel Peralta, Minister of Government Colonel Serrano
    and Intelligence Chief Colorel Porres attended for the Guate-
    maian.

TWO CIA OFFICERS WERE PRESENT

2.  At the request of the SENIOR CIA OFFICER, I
    profaced the operational briefing with a brief description
    of how the U. S. Intelligence community operates, of the
    role of CLA, of the need for compartmentation and security,
    and specifically of how the foregoing considerations make
    it imperative for the (Guatemalans) to adopt security pre-
    cautions which will ensure that the information we provide
    and the joint operations we undertake are compartmented
    within the Guatemalen government (and, in fact, discussed
    by the Guatemalan government exclusively with our re- 24
    presentatives in the fisia.)

3.  Following the introductory remarks outlined
    above, I briefed the group on the DGI structure, the PGI
    operational techniques, and specifically on DGI aims and
    operations in Guatemala) The president lent close attention
    throughout the briefing and examined the exhibits closely,
    including the DGI intelligence requirements for (Guatenisia) 11
    and the (Salvadoran "Caso Zapoto" file.)

4.  After the foregoing exposition, I explained
    our aims in exploiting the information

In this connection I asked for close cooperation
and coordination of activities, promising that wo shall
do our utmost and making reference to our travel lists
and watch list.

a. The effectiveness of his own actions against querrillas in (Guatemala) and his determination to “meet violence with violence;”

l. Recognition of the importance of the information covered in the briefing and of its exploitation;

j. Reference to the case of the (Mexican courier) working for (Cuban intelligence) and now detained in (Guatemala)

k. Acceptance of security restrictions and his decision to hold the information to those present.

7. In replying to the remarks of (Colonel Peralta), I said that we appreciate the cooperation of (Guatemala) in the OAS and that we shall be most interested in the exploitation of the possibilities in the present case. I added that the matter of using force against Cuba is a policy matter on which I was not competent to comment but that the decisions made by the United States Government are based on careful study of detailed information including information on Soviet intentions and capabilities.

8. At the conclusion of the meeting, (Peralta) asked for a copy of the (DGI) requirements (which he already had gone over closely) and took the copy with him to study further.

5. With reference to case, because
   of the developments and plans in El Salvador,) I explained
   briefly the status of the (DALTON case and the possibility
   of his being transferred to (Guatemala). (This was in line
   with the discussion in El Salvador which included our officer,
   the President and the President's intelligence 26.08
   advisor, Colonel MEDRANO). I said that the Guatemalan
   government take no action unless requested by (President 06
   RIVERA or Colonel MEDRANO and said that, (DALTON) 06
   is transferred, one of our people probably would talk to
   06 (DALTON) (Guatemala)

3. The Chief of State (Peralta) made a rather
   impassioned speech in which he covered the following points:

a. His own long experience in the OAS, in Cuba
and in Central America;

b. His early warnings about Castro--which
were disregarded;

c. The extent to which Guatemala has lived up
to its obligations in the OAS; to which it has
cooperated in efforts against Castro; and to
which it has looked toward U.S. leadership;

d. The failure of the U.S. to take aggressive
action against Cuba and the need for taking a
hard line, including the use of force in support of
military activity by the free Cubans and the other
American countries;

e. His appreciation that the Soviets will not be
willing to risk a nuclear war over Cuba;

f. Condemnation of Mexico for her dealings with
Cuba, for failure to abide by her obligations in
the OAS, and for permitting the Castroites to
operate out of Mexico against other American
countries;

g. The need for action against Mexico;

PRODUCTION OF INTELLIGENCE, SPECIFIC DETAIRS OF HOW WE ACCOMP-
LISH OUR OPS TASKING-SPOTTING, ASSESSMENT, DIRECT CONTACT
WITH TARGETS AND USE OF LIAISON - STATION BUDGET, ETC., ACTUAL
EXAMPLES WERE USED WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE POINT.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE PDWHIZ CASE WAS USED TO SHOW HOW THE STATION
FOCUSES ON AN INDIVIDUAL, PRIMARY TARGET. IT WAS A LIVELY
SESSION, WITH CONGRESSMAN ROBINSON AND SNODGRASS! THE "LIVE
WIRES" OF THE GROUP. QUESTIONS WERE OF A ROUTINE NATURE
PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCIDENTAL OPS DETAILS. FOR EXAMPLE,
CONGRESS MAN ROBINSON NOTED THAT HE FELT IT RATHER EASY TO IDENTIFY
THE SENIOR AGENCY OFFICERS OF A MISSION BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY
HAPPEN TO BE INTERFACED ADMINISTRATIVELY WITHIN AN EMBASSY
COS RESPONSE WAS THAT SUCH IS OFTEN TRUE, BUT THAT STATIONS AND

   BRIEFING AS PER REF WAS "DAMN GOOD" AND THAT HE APPRECIATED THE

2, MR. SNODGRASS ALSO VOLUNTERRED THAT THE BRIEFING HAD
IMPACTED FAVORABLY ON THE DELEGATION AND THAT THEY WERE SURPRISED
AND PLEASED TO GET SUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS.
HE ADDED THAT WHAT OFTEN GAVE HIM TROUBLE WAS STATEMENTS BY
AGENCY OFFICERS THAT THEY HAD BEEN PURSUING SOVIET OFFICIALS FOR
TEN YEARS OR MORE AND HAD NOT YET RECRUITED ONE. HE ALLUDED TO
THIS AS THE BUREAUCRAT'S DREAM, BEING PERPETUALLY PAID FOR SEEKING
THE HOLY GRAIL WITHOUT EVER FINDING IT. COS POINTED OUT TO MR.
SNUDGRASS THAT SOVIETS WERE BEING RECRUITED AND THAT THE WORK
OF UNE STATION WHICH MIGHT NOT RESULT IN RECRUITMENT WOULD BE

RECRUITMENT APPROACH, IN COST EFFECTIVENESS TERMS, ALSO POINTED
OUT THAT THE RECRUITMENT OF A SINGLE SOVIET COULD AND DOES RESULT
IN A MORE ACCURATE APPRAISAL OF THE SOVIET THREAT AND THUS A MORE
REALISTIC ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO MEET IT. MR. SNODGRASS ADMITTED
THAT THIS WAS SO BUT ADDED HIS OPINION THAT MORE RATHER THAN LESS
CONGRESSIONAL CONTACT WITH CIA FIELD PERSONNEL AS IN JAKARTA
WOULD BE A PLUS FOR THE AGENCY AND GIVE THE CONGRESS A BETTER
FEEL FOR OUR ENDEAVORS AND PROBLEMS.

3. MR. CAREY ALSO SAID THAT ON THE BASIS OF HIS TALKS WITH
   MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIEFING HAD GONE
   DOWN WELL AND THAT THEY FELT THEY WERE BEING GIVEN AN ACCURATE
   AND INTERESTING INSIGHT.

DISCUSS THIS WITH THE CHARGE, BUT OFFERED AS A PERSONAL OPINION THAT IT WOULD DO NO HARM AND MIGHT DO SOME VERY REAL GOOD FOR CONGRESSMEN TO LET THEIR FEELINGS BE KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT. COS ADDED THAT HE HAD FREQUENTLY TOLD HIS INDONESIAN COUNTERPARTS THAT IT DID NO GOOD FOR ASIAN LEADERS TO SAY PRIVATELY THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY MEAN WHAT THEY DID SAY PUBLICLY SINCE THE PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE ON THE RECORD AND THE PRIVATE ONES WERE NOT.

4. THESE GENTLEMEN ARE HARD BITTEN, PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS. GENERALLY THEY APPEARED TO FAVOR A CONTINUING ROLE FOR THE U.S. IN ASIAN AFFAIRS, INCLUDING CONTINUING MILITARY ASSISTANCE. THEY ARE, HOWEVER, DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF ASIAN LEADERS, THEIR WILL AND ABILITY TO SURVIVE AGAINST DETERMINED COMMUNIST SUBVERSION, AND THEIR PERSONAL INTEGRITY, CONGRESSMAN WILSON RECOUNTED THAT HE HAD BEEN PRESENT WHEN SUKARNO ADDRESSED A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS AND WAS HAILED AS A GREAT NATIONALIST LEADER. HE ADDED, "LOOK AT WHAT THAT (EXPLETIVE DELETED) DID TO USI" THEY EXPRESSED VERY LITTLE OF THEIR UPINIONS CONCERNING THE AGENCY, ALTHOUGH BOTH SEEMED TO ATTEMPT TO ELICIT STATEMENTS FROM COS CRITICAL OF MR. HELMS. IN THIS, OF COURSE, THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. BOTH EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR THE CONDOR OF MR. COLBY.

SHIPS WITH THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT ALSO WAS DISCUSSED. IT WAS UNDER-
SCORED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO NOT RECRUITABLE TODAY MIGHT BE
RECRUITABLE IN FUTURE IF WE CAN LEARN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MOTIVATES
THE TARGET AND WHAT MAKES THEM TICK AS HUMAN BEINGS. THE BRIEFING

BROAD ASPECTS OF CIA'S LIAISON WITH ASIO, ASIS AND JIO.Y

YOU SHOWED IN THE PROBLEMS WE FACE HERE IN KOREA. I AM ONLY SORRY
THAT OUR SCHEDULES DID NOT PERMIT US TO EXPLORE THE CHALLENGES WE
FACE HERE AND OUR CAPABILITIES TO DEAL WITH THEM IN GREATER DETAIL.
THIS LETTER INCORPORATES BOTH GENERAL HOLLINGSWORTH'S AND MY
VIEWS.

AS FIELD COMMANDERS, WE ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE AREA OF
INTELLIGENCE - AND FOR GOOD REASONS. A COMMANDER HAS A FUNDAMENTAL
INTEREST IN PROTECTING HIS COMMAND AND ASSURING THAT, SHOULD
HOSTILITIES OCCUR, HIS COMBAT RECOURSES ARE EMPLOYED IN THE MOST
EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE.

ORGANIZATIONALLY, THE US INTELLIGENCE SETUP IN KOREA IS VIABLE.
THE RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES,
I.E., CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA), DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
(DIA), AND NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA) WORK EFFECTIVELY IN
CONCERT WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE STAFFS AND THOSE COLLECTION ELEMENTS
WHICH ARE UNDER OUR CONTROL TO PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED AND
EFFICIENT FLOW OF INTELLIGENCE. WE HAVE BEEN MOST IMPRESSED WITH THE
DEDICATION AND PROFESSIONALISM OF THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS ASSIGNED
TO THOSE NATIONAL AGENCIES; AND WE HAVE EQUALLY HIGH RESPECT FOR OUR

OF QUALITY INTELLIGENCE.

LIKE ALL COMMANDERS, HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT FULLY SATISFIED WITH ALL
ASPECTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE EFFORT. THE PRIMARY NEED IS FOR
RELIABLE WARNING INTELLIGENCE. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE
ENEMY'S AIRFIELDS, AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR TROOPS LIVE WITHIN
THE RANGE FANS OF HIS EMPLACED WEAPONS SYSTEMS, WE MUST CONSTANTLY BE
ALERT FOR THOSE ANOMALIES IN HIS BEHAVIOR WHICH WOULD TIP US OFF
TO IMPENDING ATTACK. UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF HIS READINESS AND
THE FORWARD DISPOSITION OF HIS FORCES, INCLUDING FORWARD POSITIONING
OF SUPPLIES, WE DO NOT HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF ASSURANCE THAT WE
WILL HAVE MUCH WARNING. WHILE WE MIGHT HAVE DAYS OR WEEKS, IT IS
MORE PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD HAVE ONLY HOURS. TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS,
US AND ROK FORCES MAINTAIN A HIGH DEGREE OF ALERT, PREPARED TO
QUICKLY ENGAGE THE FORCES OF THE NORTH SHOULD THEY INITIATE
AN ATTACK. CONCURRENTLY, WE AND THE NATIONAL LEVEL INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY ARE SEEKING WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR SYSTEMS AND METHODOLOGIES
TO INCREASE OUR ASSURANCE OF TIMELY WARNING.

NATIONALLY MANAGED COLLECTION PROGRAMS GIVE US INVALUABLE

IN THE AREA OF ELECTRONIC INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE REQUESTED A HIGH ALTITUDE PLATFORM TO BE OPERATED OVER THE SOUTH KOREAN LAND MASS TO GIVE US A DEEPER AND MORE EFFECTIVE LOOK INTO THE ENEMY'S ELECTRONIC ENVIRONMENT. THE REQUESTED SYSTEM INCLUDES A DOWN LINK CAPABILITY WHICH WOULD GIVE US A NEAR REAL TIME READ OUT OF DATA COLLECTED. OUR PROPOSAL HAS RECEIVED STRONG SUPPORT FROM DIA AND NSA. WE ALSO HAVE HIGH INTEREST IN INSURING THAT WE WILL HAVE DOWN LINK ACCESS TO NATIONALLY MANAGED OVERHEAD PHOTOGRAPHY SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE NOT YET OPERATIONAL.

BECAUSE OF FEVER COS HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL AND
DISCUSSIONS WERE THEREFORE HELD AT THE HOSPITAL SITTING
ROOM.

   BY REITERATING CONCERNS SURFACED THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON.
   IN ADDITION TO HIS REFERENT A ASSESSMENT, HE STATED

IN FORWARDING OF INTELLIGENCE,

C. NEW LEGISLATION AND NEW PERMANENT, PREFERABLE
JOINT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ARE REQUIRED.

2, THE CONGRESSMAN STATED THAT THE COMMITTEE
INQUIRIES ARE POLITICAL IN NATURE AND IN HIS OPINION
THERE IS NO PRETENSE OF OBJECTIVITY. TIME FACTORS
DID NOT PERMIT HIM OR OTHER MEMBERS TO PERSONALLY
OR SERIOUSLY ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS INVOLVED SO
THAT FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES, MOST MEMBERS WERE "PRISONERS
OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF", HE HAS NOT BEEN HAPPY WITH
THIS SITUATION AND HAD INITIALLY PROPOSED THAT EACH
COMMITTEE MEMBER BE PERMITTED TO PERSONALLY SELECT
ONE STAFF MEMBER FOR ASSIGNMENT TO THE COMMITTEE,
HE HAD LINED UP A TOTAL OF SIX MEMBERS TO BACK THIS
APPROACH, WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AGREED TO LET HIM SELECT
ONE STAFF MEMBER IF HE IN TURN WOULD DROP HIS SPONSORSHIP
OF THIS PROPOSAL, HE AGREED, BUT SAID THAT HE HAD AS
YET BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE.
HE DISMISSED THE CURRENT COMMITTEE STAFF AS STARRY-EYED
LIBERALS OUT TO MAKE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES, HE IS

STAFF ASSISTANT ON THE COMMITTEE, BUT DID NOT APPEAR
SANGUINE THAT HE WOULD COME UP WITH THE RIGHT MAN,
3. CUS NOTED THAT DIRECTOR COLBY WOULD BE
THOROUGHLY DELIGHTED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A
JOINT CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SINCE HE
WAS NOW OBLIGED TO REPORT TO SIX SEPARATE COMMITTEES.
COS EVIDENCED SOME SKEPTICISM THAT A JOINT OVERSIGHT
COMMITTEE WOULD BE ESTABLISHED. THE CONGRESSMAN WAS
NOT OPTIMISTIC IN THE SHORT TERM BUT BELIEVED THAT
A JOINT COMMITTEE WILL EVENTUALLY BE ESTABLISHED,
HE SAID THAT RIGHT NOW THE AGENCY IS ESSENTIALLY IN
AN UNDERDOG POSITION AND IS GOOD COPY, HOWEVER,
OVER THE LONGER TERM, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
SCORES NO POINTS WITH THE FOLKS BACK IN HOMETOWN USA SO
THAT IN TIME CONGRESSMEN WILL NAMEUVER TO AVOID THE
ASSIGNMENT.

COMMITTEE THAT WOULD HAVE CREDIBILITY IN THE EYES OF
THE HOUSE AND HAVE PROCEDURES THAT WOULD PERMIT EFFECTIVE

THE HOUSE COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP BE COMPOSED OF ONE
MEMBER NOMINATED FROM THE ARMED FORCES COMMITTEE,
ONE FROM THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, ONE APPOINTED

A DISSENTING MINORITY REPORT FOCUSING IN A POSITIVE MANNER ON THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION RATHER THAN THE HISTORICAL ISSUES THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS FOCUSED IN A NON-OBJECTIVE MANNER. HOWEVER, SINCE DECEMBER IS FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES NOT A WORKING MONTH, THIS GIVES HIM ONLY THIRTY DAYS TO PUT TOGETHER A REPORT. SINCE HE IS A MEMBER OF THREE HOUSE COMMITTEES AND CHAIRMAN OF ONE SUB-COMMITTEE WITH NOT EVEN ONE STAFF ASSISTANT ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE HE IS FINDING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOP A MINORITY REPORT. HE TURNED ASIDE THE SUGGESTION THAT FAVORABLE WITNESSES BE CALLED AS IMPRACTICAL. HE SAID, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT IF HE ASKED GENERAL WALTERS OR PRESTIGIOUS AND KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSONALITIES WITH INTELLIGENCE BACKGROUNDS TO APPEAR, THEY WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO MAKE AN OBJECTIVE AND BALANCED PRESENTATION, THE COMMITTEE'S LINE OF QUESTIONING WOULD BE CONFINED TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE "DEAD CATS" OF TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. HE ALSO FORESAW NO POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING THE MAJORITY VIEWS OR THE MAJORITY REPORT, HE WAS CLEARLY CONCERNED THAT SAM ADAMS'

WITH "UNCLASSIFIED ASPECTS" OF THE REVIEW. (HOW ONE RECONCILES THIS CANNOT BE SUGGESTED FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT, IT MERELY EMPHASIZES THE LACK OF FOCUS AND THE CONGRESSMAN'S DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE, BUT HIS INABILITY TO FIND A "HANDLE".)

8. THE CONGRESSMAN COMMENTED THAT THE SECURITY OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL IN THE COMMITTEE'S HANDS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM, THE HSC RULES STATE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL MUST NOT BE RELEASED BUT THESE RESTRICTIONS DIRECTLY CONTRAVENE HOUSE REGULATIONS ON THIS POINT AND WOULD NOT BE SUSTAINED IF CHALLENGED, HOWEVER, SINCE THE HARRINGTON EPISODE HE DOUBTED THAT THE HSC'S SPECIAL RULE WOULD BE CHALLGNGED (ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT HOUSE RULES ANY MEMBER CAN ASK FOR A COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT OF ANY CLOSED COMMITTEE HEARING AND USE IT ALMOST WITH IMPUNITY).

BEST TO GIVE THE CONGRESSMAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHART
THE COURSE. IN SO DOING IT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR
THAT HIS INTEREST LAY IN THE AGENCY'S ROLE VIS-A-VIS THE
INTEL COMMUNITY IN THE FIELD. HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW
COORDINATION AND CONTROL WAS EXERCISED IN THE FIELD.
COS EXPLAINED THE CHIEF OF STATION'S RESPONSIBILITY
AND AUTHORITY IN THE COORDINATION OF CLANDESTINE
COLLECTION PORGRAMS. IN DISCUSSING COORDINATION OF
MILITARY COLLECTION AGENCIES COS IN DUE COURSE
SUGGESTED THAT MILITARY REPRESENTATIONS MIGHT
PROFITABLY BE INVITED TO JOIN IN THE DISCUSSION.

THE SENIOR NSA REPRESENTATIVE MR, DELMAR C. LANG INTO

10. THE CONGRESSMAN WAS CONCERNED THAT THERE

    SPEED AND ASSURANCE OF COVERAGE WHEN SUCH WERE
    EMPLOYED. HE ADDED THAT PLACING A UNIFYING LAYER
    OF BUREAUCRACY ON TOP WOULD TEND: TO DELAY THE
    MORE RAPID TRANSMISSION OF INTELLIGENCE; TO STIFLE
    DISSENTING VIEWS AND TO CREATE A MONSTROUS SIZED

GENERAL STATED THAT HE WANTED MORE NORTH KOREAN TACTICAL,
PHOTO, AND EVEN ECONOMIC COVERAGE AND HE DEPENDED ON
NSA AND CIA TO GET IT FOR HIM. HE COMPLETELY
DISCOUNTED U.S. MILITARY INTELLIGENCE EFFORTS SAYING
THE ARMY DID NOT PUT HIGH CALIBER MEN INTO INTELLIGENCE
AND DID NOT DEVELOP INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS.
HE NOTED THAT HIS SPECIAL FORCES COMMANDER HAD JUST
BEEN TRANSFERRED TO DIA IN AN INTELLIGENCE ASSIGNMENT,
HE SAID HE WAS A GOOD SPECIAL FORCES COMMANDER BUT
NO INTEL OFFICER, WHEREAS HIS FORMER G-2 HAD BEEN
REASSIGNED TO HONOLULU IN A PERSONNEL SLOT, AND THEN
THE ARMY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE A QUALIFIED
COLONEL AS A REPLACEMENT, HE SAID THAT IN CONTRAST
CIA AND NSA HAVE CAREER PROFESSIONALS WITH WHOM THE
FIELD COMMANDER CAN WORK, AS HE FORMERLY DID IN
VIETNAM AND AS HE IS NOW DOING IN KOREA. HOLLINGSWORTH
ALSO ADDED KUDOS FOR STATION MILITARY REPORTING,
NOTING THAT KOREA IS A MILITARY-ORIENTED SOCIETY

IF THERE WAS ANY POLITICAL RISK OR SENSITIVITY HE WOULD
PROBABLY ALERT THE AMBASSADOR. COS POINTED OUT THE FACT OF
COORDINATION WITH THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES REDUCED THE RISK
CONSIDERABLY.

B. HE ASKED IF A LARGE SCALE ACTION TYPE PROGRAM COORDINAATED
WITH THE BRITISH SUCH AS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN PORTUGAL WOULD BE
CLEARED WITH THE AMBASSADOR. AFTER HE HAD REPHRASED THE QUESTION
TO LEAVE OUT ANY MENTION OF PORTUGAL, COS STATED THAT HE WOULD
SEEK AUTHORITY FROM WASHINGTON TO INFORM THE AMBASSADOR OF ANY SUCH
SITUATION.

C. HE ASKED IF COS WOULD APPROACH THE FOREIGN OFFICE
DIRECTLY OR THROUGH GNGRAPH IN ORDER TO COORDINATE SUCH A
PROGRAM. COS REPLED THAT NORMALLY HE WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO
GNGRAPH AND THAT THEY WOULD INSURE COORDINATION WITH THE FOREIGN
OFFICE.

D. HE ASKED IF GNGRAPH HAD TO CLEAR BOTH INTELLIGENCE
COLLECTION AND ACTION OPERATIONS WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THE
U.K. AMBASSADOR IN THE FIELD. COS REPLIED THAT ACTION
OPERATIONS HAD TO BE CLEARED WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE, BUT THAT
HE IS NOT SURE AS TO HOW MUCH COORDINATION WAS REQUIRED ON

COLLECTION OPERATION, AARON WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PURSUE THIS
POINT IN HIS MEETING THIS AFTERNOON WITH SYKES AND HOOPER
AND WE WILL REPORT ANY PLAYBACK WE GET. HE ASKED WHETHER
IN COS'S JUDGMENT IT WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT ON PRESENT
PROCEDURES FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO REQUIRE PRIOR CLEARANCE
WITH OUR AMBASSADORS OF ALL INTELLIGENCE AND ACTION OPERATIONS.
COS REPLIED THAT IF ALL THE AMBASSADORS WERE AS ABLE AND AS
INFORMED AS THIS ONE AND SOME OTHERS HE HAD KNOWN, THAT THIS
MIGHT WORK. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT MANY AMBASSADORS HAD NO
KNOWLEDGE OR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE FIELD AND NO
BASIS FOR MAKING INFORMED JUDGMENTS, AND THE RESULT, THEREFORE,
OF SUCH A RULE MIGHT BE TO SERIOUSLY INHIBIT AND PREVENT MANY
OPERATIONS THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN.

E. IN ANSWER TO ANOTHER QUESTION, COS CONFIRMED THAT BOTH
THE AMBASSADOR AND THE BRITISH WERE PERIODICALLY BRIEFED ON
THE STATUS OF ANY COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS TAKING PLACE IN
THE U.K.

3. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE DISCUSSIONS, COS TRIED TO MAKE
   THE FOLLOWING POINTS:

A. THE BRITISH WERE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED BY THE LEAKS AND

CONTINUING PUBLICITY IN WASHINGTON. THE PAD BEEN REASSURED BY US THAT WE WOULD PROTECT THE LIAISON RELATIONSHIP AND THE PRODUCT, AND TO DATE THERE HAD BEEN NO DIMINUTION OF THHE INTELLIGENCE THEY WERE PRPARED TO GIVE US, AARON SAID HE WOULD ALSO REASSURE SYKES AND HOOPER ON THIS POINT AS FAR AS THE SENATE COMMITTEE IS CONCERNED.

B. COS POINTED OUT BRITISH INTELLIGENCE ENJOYED AN ENVIABLE DEGREE OF PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT. THE ABSENCE OF PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATIONS AND THE VERY EFFECTIVE COVER PROVIDED BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE FOR GNGRAPH REPRESENTATIVES SERVCING OVERSEAS. COS TOLD AARON THAT ONE OF THE USEFUL THINGS THE SENATE COMMITTEE MIGHT DO WOULD BE TO CALL FOR NEW LEGISLATION THAT MIGHT OFFER SOME PROTECTION SIMILAR TO THE KIND THAT THE BRITISH ENJOY. AARON SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS IN FACT LOOKING INTO THIS PROBLEM.

C. COS REVIEWED THE PUBLIC EVIDENCE AVAILABLE AS TO WHAT PHIL AGEE HAS BEEN UP TO AND POINTED OUT THE KIND OF DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EFFECTIVE SANCTIONS. COS DUCKED A QUESTION FROM AARON AS TO HOW MUCH

1. MR. DAVID AARON OF SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE BRIEFED BY
   STIGGINS, HIBBERT AND DEUTINGER FOR TWO HOURS MORNING 15. OCTOBER.
   AARON HAD LUNCH WITH HIBBERT AND NEWLY ARRIVED ARMY ATTACHE
   COLONEL OLIVER RAY. HE MET FOR OVER HOUR WITH AMBASSADOR
   HILLENBRAND AFTERNOON 15 OCTOBER BEFORE DEPARTING FOR LONDON.

2. LARGE PART OF MORNING BRIEFING DEVOTED TO MILITARY
   INTELLIGENCE AFFAIRS IN GERMANY AARON ASKED FOR DEFINITION OF HOW
   AND TO WHAT EXTENT COS SUPERVISED MILITARY INTELLIGENCE EFFORT
   WHICH EXPLAINED TO HIM IN SOME DETAIL. AARON ASKED NUMBER
   QUESTIONS ABOUT COORDINATION, PROCESS AND HOW THIS IMPLEMENTED.
   HE WANTED KNOW IF THE COORDINATION PROCESS EXTENDED TO A REVIEW
   OF REQUIREMENTS AND OF THE VALUE OF MILITARY COLLECTION ACTIVITIES
   AS REFLECTED IN ITS PRODUCT AND TOLD THAT OUR COORDINATION OF
   MILITARY ACTIVITIES GENERALLY CONFINED TO INSURING THAT MILITARY
   TRADECRAFT MET OUR STANDARDS AND THAT POLITICAL RISKS ACCEPT-
   ABLE IN PRACTICE, WE DID NOT REVIEW PRODUCTION OF MILITARY
   OPERATIONS. WE MENTIONED THAT MILITARY COLLECTION IN RECENT YEARS
   WAS ON RELATIVELY MODEST SCALE AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO FLAPS
   IN RECENT YEARS:

3. MR.. AARON SAID THAT THE SENATORS ON HIS COMMITTEE HAD BEEN
   SURPRISED TO FIND THAT MILITARY WAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN COLL-
   ECTION ACTIVITY SINCE THIS NOT COVERED IN ANY LEGISLATION, BUT
   ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SUCH ACTIVITY AUTHORIZED IN NONSKIDS. STIGGINS
   MADE POINT THAT MILITARY IN GERMANY STRUCTURED ALONG COMBAT
   INTELLIGENCE LINES AND IN EFFECT ENGAGED IN MILITARY COLLECTION OF
   TACTICAL NATURE AS TRAINING EXERCISE APPROPRIATE TO THEIR
   POTENTIAL WARTIME MISSION. MR. AARON SEVERAL TIMES SUGGESTED
   MILITARY ORS AND PERSONNEL: COULD BE ASSIGNED TO CIA OPERATIONAL

CONTROL IN FIELD. WE OPINED THIS IS TO SOME EXTENT DIRECTION IN
WHICH COORDINATION HAS TRENDED OVER THE YEARS BUT LOCAL COMMANDERS
PROBABLY FEEL HIS CONTROL UNDERMINED THEREBY.

4. TURNING TO BKHERALD OPS, MR. AARON SAID HE RECALLED
   FROM WASHINGTON BRIEFING THAT GERMAN STATION HAD SIZEABLE ALLOT-
   MENT FOR OFFICER ENGAGED IN POLITICAL COVERT ACTION ON REGIONAL
   BASIS. WE EXPLAINED THAT MONIES IN THIS PROJECT ALMOST EX-
   CLUSIVELY FOR SALARY AND EXTENSIVE TRAVEL OF OFFICER (HERZFANZ
   NOT MENTIONED BY NAME) AND NOT USED FOR AGENT PAYMENT OR OTHER
   PURPOSES. THIS SEEMED TO SATISFY AARON.

5. HE ASKED NUMBER QUESTIONS ABOUT: *"FANCY"* POLITICAL SOURCES,
   ALONG: LINE THAT THESE COULD PERHAPS BE HANDLED AS NORMAL
   DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS AND ASKED WHETHER THESE CONTACTS DID NOT
   REPRESENT HIGH RISK IF EXPOSED. STIGGINS EXPLAIND AT SOME LENGTH
   THAT THESE SOURCES VERY FEW-IN NUMBER, AND WERE PRODUCT OF SEVERAL
   FACTORS, INCLUDING MANY YEARS CONTACT WITH SPECIFIC CIA
   OFFICERS, MAKING POINT THAT AGENTS CONFIDENCE IN CIA BASED ON
   MANY YEARS ASSOCIATION. WE ESTIMATED FLAP POTENTIAL SLIGHT
   THESE LONG-STANDING: CONTACTS, WHICH COULD BE EXPLAINED AS OLD
   FRIENDSHIPS. FOR REASON THAT THEY WERE, IN FACT SUCH, THESE
   RELATIONSHIPS COULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED TO STATE DEPARTMENT
   OFFICERS. WE MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE LOWER-LEVEL DEVELOPMENTAL
   OPERATIONS ACTUALLY REPRESENTED HIGHER RISK AND CITED GENERAL
   OUTLINE OF *"HILTON AFFAIR"* (WITHOUT NAMES) AS EXAMPLE HOW
   DEVELOPMENTAL CASE COULD BE TROUBLESOME. EMPHASIZED THERE HAD
   BEEN FEW OF THESE OVER YEARS

6. AARON ASKED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FEDREP REACTION IN
   EVENT OUR INCOMPATIBLE SOURCES EXPOSED. WE RESPONDED THAT IN
   GENERAL GERMANS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN EMBARRASSING US AND THAT THIS
   KEY ELEMENT, PLUS: FACTOR THAT WE HANDLED ALL INCOMPATIBLE ACTIVITY
   VERY CAREFULLY, LED US TO CONCLUSION THAT WE WERE NOT RUNNING
   RISK MAJOR EMBARRASSMENT BY CONDUCTING LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE
   OPERATIONS. POINTED OUT THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THESE OPERATIONS
   ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE COVERAGE THOSE AREAS IN EAST-WEST RELATIONS
   AND SOME ECONOMIC FIELDS WHERE GERMANS NOT COMPLETELY CANDID
   WITH US EMBASSY RE THEIR ACTIVITIES.

   ON OUR ACTIVITIES IN WEST GERMAN FIELD. WE REPLIED THAT AMBASSADOR

   LOCATED BUT THAT AS RULE WE DID NOT CLEAR WITH HIM ON INDIVIDUAL
   CONTACTS, MAKING REFERENCE TO "SOURCES AND METHOD'S" PROVISION OF
   OUR REGULATION AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS. POINTED OUT THAT EACH
   CASE TREATED SEPARATELY BUT THAT AMBASSADOR AND EMBASSY/CON-
   SULATES HAVE NOT HAD INTEREST IN DEVELOPMENTAL CONTACT WITH
   YOUNGER POLITICAL FIGURES OUTSIDE BONN AREA. ON OTHER HAND HE
   CLEARLY QUITE CONCERNED WITH FOREIGN MINISTRY WITH RESULT THAT WE
   GENERALLY ASSUMED HANDS-OFF ATTITUDE ON FONMIN.

8. MR. AARON INQUIRED RE STATION CASE OFFICER STRENGTH AND
   GIVEN FIGURES CITED IN POSITION REPORT DATED OCTOBER 74 (FORWARDED
   HQS BY TM DATED 25 SEPT 74.) WE EXPLAINED THAT BREAKDOWN SOMEWHAT

   LIAISON, SUPPORT, ANALYSIS, FOR INSTANCE) IT NOT ALWAYS EASY TO
   CATEGORIZE THEIR EFFORTS.

9. HE PROBED IN SOME DETAIL ON OUR NOC STRENGTH AND WE
   ANSWERED CANDIDLY. MR. AARON SEEMED SURPRISED AT SMALL NUMBERS
   NOC OFFICERS IN STATION AND SAID HAD HEARD OPINION FROM SOME CIA
   OFFICERS THAT NOC PREFERABLE TO OFFICIAL COVER. WE SAID FELT
   THIS DEFENDENT ON LOCATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT HERE IN
   GERMANY ARMY COVER READILY AVAILABLE, GENERALLY QUITE SATISFACTORY
   AND COST CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN NOC COVER. AARON ASKED SEVERAL
   QUESTIONS RE REASONS WE WOULD PUT OFFICER IN GERMANY UNDER NOC.
   WE EXPLAINED NOC PRIMARILY USED FOR PERSONNEL WE PLANNED KEEP
   ASSIGNED GERMANY SEVERAL YEARS AND WHERE NOC PROBABLY MORE SECURE
   AND FOR INSTANCES WHERE IT PROVIDED BETTER ACCESS. WHEN HE PUSHED
   FOR FURTHER EXAMPLES WE MENTIONED HAD RECENTLY CONSIDERED PUTTING
   OFFICER UNDER STUDENT COVER IN HEIDELBERG WHERE OFFICIAL CHINESE
   STUDENTS SIGNIFICANT TARGET REPRESENTED BUT THAT THIS PLAN DROPPED
   FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REASONS. WE MADE NO MENTION USE JOURNALIST
   COVER AND DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY COVER FIRMS BY NAME.

10. AARON ASKED STIGGINS WHICH OF WHAT AARONS ENVISAGED AS THREE
    PRINCIPAL DUTIES TOOK MOST TIME. AARON OUTLINED COS DUTIES AS
    MANAGEMENT OF STATION, EMBASSY RESPONSIBILITIES AND COORDINATION

1. AMBASSADOR BRIEFED COS AFTERNOON 16 OCT ON HIS HOUR AND ONE-HALF SESSION WITH MR, AARON ON 15 OCT. DISCUSSION COVERED THREE MAIN TOPICS: (A) RISKS AND NEED FOR "FANCY POLITICAL SOURCES" IN BONN; (B) COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS; AND (C) DEGREE TO WHICH AMBASSADOR COGNIZANT OF STATION ACTIVITIES.

2. ON POINT OMA. AMBASSADOR STATED THAT MOST STATION POLITICAL SOURCES WERE OF LONG-STANDING AND COMMENCED IN THE EARLY POST WAR/OCCUPATION ERA. THEY WERE BASED ON PERSONAL FRIENDSHIPS AND UNIQUE CHARACTER OF THE EARLY POSTWAR YEARS AND WERE IN HIS BELIEF LIKELY TO PROVE IRREPLACEABLE. THAT IS, AMBASSADOR OPINED THAT SIMILAR CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED BY STATION IN TODAY'S POLITICAL CLIMATE AND IMPLIED THAT HE EXPECTED COVERAGE TO GRADUALLY WITHER AWAY. BECAUSE OF THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE RELATION-SHIPS, AMBASSADOR BELIEVED RISK WAS VERY LOW AND STATED THAT.

3. REGARDING PARA 1.B., AMBASSADOR CONFIRMED TO AARON
   THAT IT WAS HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT STATION WAS NO LONGER
   INVOLVED IN LARGE-SCALE COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS AND THAT HE
   ASSUMED EXPLANATION PER PARA 4 REF WAS IN ACCORD WITH FACTS.

4. WITH RESPECT TO THE AMBASSADOR'S KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFICS

   OF OUR SOURCES BUT HAD NOT BEEN SPECIFICALLY ADVISED OF THE

BONN HAD BEEN KEPT APPROPRIATELY ADVISED AND THE ABSENCE OF
FLAPS WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THE JUDGMENT EXERCISED BY THE RE-

5, MR, AARON DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH WITH THE AMBASSADOR
THE FEASIBILITY OF CHARGING THE AMBASSADOR WITH GREATER DIRECT
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPERVISION OF THE CLANDESTINE EFFORT.
AMBASSADOR STATED THAT IF IT WERE ASSIGNED TO HIM AS A MISSION
HE WOULD MANIFESTLY HAVE TO DISCHARGE IT AND WOULD AS HE SAW IT
PROBABLY NEED A STAFF OF AT LEAST TWO COMPETENT OFFICERS TO
CARRY OUT THE PRACTICAL STAFF WORK ON HIS BEHALF. MR. AARON THEN
RAISED THE QUESTION OF THE BRITISH SYSTEM ABOUT WHICH THE AMBASSA-

B. HE ASKED IF A LARGE SCALE ACTION TYPE PROGRAM COORDINAATED WITH THE BRITISH SUCH AS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN PORTUGAL WOULD BE CLEARED WITH THE AMBASSADOR. AFTER HE HAD REPHRASED THE QUESTION TO LEAVE OUT ANY MENTION OF PORTUGAL, COS STATED THAT HE WOULD SEEK AUTHORITY FROM WASHINGTON TO INFORM THE AMBASSADOR OF ANY SUCH SITUATION.

C. HE ASKED IF COS WOULD APPROACH THE FOREIGN OFFICE DIRECTLY OR THROUGH GNGRAPH IN ORDER TO COORDINATE SUCH A PROGRAM. COS REPLED THAT NORMALLY HE WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO GNGRAPH AND THAT THEY WOULD INSURE COORDINATION WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE.

D. HE ASKED IF GNGRAPH HAD TO CLEAR BOTH INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND ACTION OPERATIONS WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THE U.K. AMBASSADOR IN THE FIELD . COS REPLIED THAT ACTION OPERATIONS HAD TO BE CLEARED WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE, BUT THAT HE IS NOT SURE AS TO HOW MUCH COORDINATION WAS REQUIRED ON

HE ASKED WHETHER IN COS'S JUDGMENT IT WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT ON PRESENT PROCEDURES FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO REQUIRE PRIOR CLEARANCE WITH OUR AMBASSADORS OF ALL INTELLIGENCE AND ACTION OPERATIONS. COS REPLIED THAT IF ALL THE AMBASSADORS WERE AS ABLE AND AS INFORMED AS THIS ONE AND SOME OTHERS HE HAD KNOWN, THAT THIS MIGHT WORK. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT MANY AMBASSADORS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE FIELD AND NO BASIS FOR MAKING INFORMED JUDGMENTS, AND THE RESULT, THEREFORE, OF SUCH A RULE MIGHT BE TO SERIOUSLY INHIBIT AND PREVENT MANY OPERATIONS THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN.

E. IN ANSWER TO ANOTHER QUESTION, COS CONFIRMED THAT BOTH THE AMBASSADOR AND THE BRITISH WERE PERIODICALLY BRIEFED ON THE STATUS OF ANY COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS TAKING PLACE IN THE U.K.

3. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE DISCUSSIONS, COS TRIED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:

THE BRITISH WERE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED BY THE LEAKS AND

PRODUCT, AND TO DATE THERE HAD BEEN NO DIMINUTION

HE WOULD ALSO REASSURE SYKES AND HOOPER ON THIS POINT AS FAR AS
THE SENATE COMMITTEE IS CONCERNED.

B. COS POINTED OUT BRITISH INTELLIGENCE ENJOYED AN ENVIABLE
DEGREE OF PROTECTION AS A RESULT OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT.
THE ABSENCE OF PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATIONS AND THE VERY
EFFECTIVE COVER PROVIDED BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE FOR GNGRAPH
REPRESENTATIVES SERVCING OVERSEAS. COS TOLD AARON THAT ONE
OF THE USEFUL THINGS THE SENATE COMMITTEE MIGHT DO WOULD
BE TO CALL FOR NEW LEGISLATION THAT MIGHT OFFER SOME
PROTECTION SIMILAR TO THE KIND THAT THE BRITISH ENJOY,
AARON SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS IN FACT LOOKING INTO THIS
PROBLEM.

C. COS REVIEWED THE PUBLIC EVIDENCE AVAILABLE AS TO
WHAT PHIL AGEE HAS BEEN UP TO AND POINTED OUT THE KIND OF
DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EFFECTIVE
SANCTIONS, COS DUCKED A QUESTION FROM AARON AS TO HOW MUCH

   IN URUGUAY. HENCE MANY QUESTIONS WERE HIGHLY HYPOTHETICAL, MOST
   IMPORTANT IMPRESSION WAS THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR TRUEHART (WHOM
   COS HAD MET IN NIGERIA YEARS AGO) FEELS THAT AN AMBASSADOR
   SHOULD BE FAR MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT ALL REPEAT ALL STATION
   OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO JUDGE POSSIBLE "FLAP POTENTIAL".

2. COS DID NOT SHOW OD TO VISITORS SINCE THEY DID NOT ASK

4. BOTH AARON AND TRUEHART QUESTIONED AT LENGTH WHAT KIND OF THINGS WE COORDINATE WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND IN WHAT DEPTH PRIOR TO INITIATION OF AN OPERATION. WHAT KIND OF AGENTS WOULD WE IDENTIFY BY NAME TO THE AMBASSADOR? COS SAID HE WOULD BE INCLINED TO REVEAL TO THE AMBASSADOR THE NAME OF ANY SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR WAS DEALING OFFICIALLY AND INTIMATELY, BUT THIS WOULD IN LARGE PART DEPEND ON THE AMBASSADORS WISHES HIMSELF.

1. HAD TWO HOUR SESSION WITH AARON AND TRUEHEART AFTERNOON 22 SEPT. TRUEHEART AWAY PART OF TIME TO TALK TO OTHERS IN EMBASSY AS AARON WAS CONCENTRATING ON STATION'S ACTIVITIES.

2. QUESTIONS RAN ALONG LINES OF THOSE INDICATED IN DIRECTOR 744266, PLUS QUITE A FEW EXTRAS. FOL IS HIGHLIGHT OF FIVE AND ONE-HALF HOURS OF DISCUSSIONS HELD STAURDAY AND MONDAY.

3. AARON MOST INTERESTED IN HOW STATION RAN ITS OPERATIONS--E.G, LINE OF COMMAND FROM HOS AND STATION'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BASES. HE WENT OVER OD MINUTELY, THEN PERUSED EXAMPLES OF TELENOTE REQUIREMENTS SENT FROM STATION TO BASES INCLUDING SUCH AS HBBS 933. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WERE RAISED ON HOW CONTROL WAS EXERCISED OVER OUR OPERATIONS. BASICALLY, HE WAS TOLD THAT ALL ACTIVITIES CENTERED AROUND THE OD, OUR PROJECTS, FUNDS, AND MANPOWER ALLOCATION WERE DESIGNED TO MEET

HOPED TO DO WITH REFERENCE TO OUR OD PRIORITIES, AND THIS WAS
FOLLOWED BY REPORTS ON WHAT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN ACCOMPLISED AGAINST
THESE PRIORITIES, A "REPORT CARD" SYSTEM EXISTED WHEREIN
WE WERE GRADED ON THE WORK DONE, AARON WAS INTERESTED IN
HOW A CASE OFFICER (THIS IS THE TERM HE USED) WORKING ON
THE HARD TARGETS WAS GRADED RELATIVE TO ONE WHOSE
TARGETS WERE LESS HARD, AND WHETHER LACK OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS
(RECRUITMENT OF A SOV, FOR EXAMPLE) WAS HELD AGAINST THE C/0.
THE EXPLANATION WAS THAT THE RECRUITMENT OF SOMEONE IN THE
HARD TARGET AREAS WAS THE ULTIMATE TEST, AND FAILURE TO RECRUIT
RECEIVED A ZERO SCORE. HOWEVER, IF THE C/O WORKING ON THE
HARD TARGET HAD BEEN IMAGINATIVE, HAD GOTTEN A NUMBER OF
ACCESS AGENTS, HAD MANAGED TO HAVE DIRECT CONTACT WITH ONE
OR MORE TARGET PERSONALITIES, AND ALL IN ALL DID HIS
HOMEWORK, WORKED HARD WAS AGGRESSIVE, BUT WAS NOT
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE TARGET WAS IN FACT NOT RECRUITABLE,
HE WAS GIVEN A GOOD GRADE, AARON MUSED WHETHER LACK OF

BRASILIA, BUT IN PANAMA FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN REPORTS
CONSIDERED HIGHLY SENSITIVE WERE OFTEN LIMITED TO THE
AMBASSADOR, THE CINSCO, AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE CANAL

CARDINAL FACTOR IN SUCH LIMITING OF DISTRIBUTION.

8. AARON WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ONE OF

REPORTS WERE SUBMITTED TO HOS TO APPRISE THEM OF WHAT WE
HOPED TO DO WITH REFERENCE TO OUR OD PRIORITIES, AND THIS WAS
FOLLOWED BY REPORTS ON WHAT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN ACCOMPLISED AGAINST

WE WERE GRADED ON THE WORK DONE. AARON WAS INTERESTED IN

THE HARD TARGETS WAS GRADED RELATIVE TO ONE WHOSE
TARGETS WERE LESS HARD, AND WHETHER LACK OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS
(RECRUITMENT OF A SOV, FOR EXAMPLE) WAS HELD AGAINST THE C/0.
THE EXPLANATION WAS THAT THE RECRUITMENT OF SOMEONE IN THE
HARD TARGET AREAS WAS THE ULTIMATE TEST, AND FAILURE TO RECRUIT
RECEIVED A ZERO SCORE, HOWEVER, IF THE C/O WORKING ON THE
HARD TARGET HAD BEEN IMAGINATIVE. HAD GOTTEN A NUMBER OF
ACCESS AGENTS, HAD MANAGED TO HAVE DIRECT CONTACT WITH ONE
OR MORE TARGET PERSONALITIES, AND ALL IN ALL DID HIS

BOTH AARON AND TRUEHEART WERE ESSENTIALLY LOW-KEY BUT THE QUESTIONS WERE SHARP, PROBING, AND AARON ESPECIALLY HAS A QUIETLY INCISIVE WAY OF GETTING AT THINGS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER THE TWO ARE FAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARD THE AGENCY OR NOT. CERTAINLY NO ANIMOSITY WAS SHOWN, BUT NEITHER WAS THERE ANY SHOW OF GREAT LOVE FOR THE AGENCY, AN OBJECTIVE APPROACH @ THE MATTER AT HAND APPEARS TO BE AN APT DESCRIPTION OF HOW THEY WORKED.

# SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.

1. **MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE ABROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.**

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad, for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum protection.

The mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence of U.S. intelligence presence within the country. Even in those countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government, care is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions

6/25/75


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the
United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public
exposure of such relationships. To help maintain the discreet
nature of the visit, it would be preferable if some reason other
than SSC business could be given to explain any visits by SSC members
and staff. No deliberate contact should be made with the local press,
nor should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating
officers are contacted by the press. Local press publicity pertaining
to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all cases be
distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet
arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence
activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers
within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the
SSC member not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business
at the time of the visit or upon his return, and his proceeding
on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

II. **THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE
VISIT.**

All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because of his
knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

III. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE
CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will only discuss operations in general terms--operational priorities, the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment, relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all cases, such discussions will only be conducted in physical surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and operationally, and cannot be divulged without the consent of the host government.

IV. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT
PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to be revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

V. MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES
WILL BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES.

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the information they pass, and the cooperation extended are all most sensitive matters. Regardless what assurances are given them, they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with members or staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters were under investigation could well cause the host service to reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. intelligence activities.

VI. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN
TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S. Congressional representatives, especially where there is public knowledge of the Congressional investigating interests. If such a visit is considered essential, a special request must be negotiated with the host country in advance.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

## VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND
STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representatives of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize the visitor with the types of activities conducted at each location, the restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case and the considerations which preclude the discussion of operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment.

Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly travel inconspicuously and will be easily recognized.

Mr. Seymour Bolten
Assistant to the Director
Room 6D0120.
Central Intelligence Agency
Langley, Virginia

Dear Mr. Bolten:

This letter is to confirm an oral request by Committee staff for an orientation briefing for a visit to South America which two members of the staff, David Aaron and William Trueheart, have been asked to make next month.

Although plans are not yet firm, it is expected that they will be free to travel during the second and third weeks of September. It is proposed that they visit Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, and Montevideo. If time permits, they might also visit another consular post in Brazil and/or Buenos Aires.

The primary purpose of this travel is to discuss State-CIA relations in the field with Embassy and Station officers. As appropriate, past Agency programs may also be reviewed.

Messrs. Aaron and Trueheart are not expected to consult with officials of the host government and, so far as the Committee is concerned, the latter need not be informed of the visit.

Sincerely yours,

![Signature]

William G. Miller

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Seymour Bolten
Review Staff

VIA: Mr. John Waller
Special Assistant to the DDO

SUBJECT: Summary of Covert Action Operations Targeted at
Right-Wing Governments

1. Pursuant to your request, forwarded as attachment A is a paper
   providing examples of covert action operations targeted at right-wing
   governments, which is responsive to a question from the Senate Select
   Committee.

2. All of the cases in the attached summary are considered sensitive
   by the area divisions and some are considered extremely sensitive up to
   today. In many ways public disclosure of some of these operations could
   impact more severely on our foreign policy interest than the other dis-
   closures on our foreign involvements. For example, a disclosure of our
   past operations in Spain could possibly adversely affect the military
   base negotiations now underway. With this problem in mind, we have
   broken the operations into two categories: Category I are those oper-
   ations about which full committee could be briefed, if necessary, and
   Category II are those operations considered extremely sensitive about
   which the committee Chairman and Co-Chairman might be briefed, if abso-
   lutely necessary.

3. In addition to the attachment A summary, we also approve the use
   (with the full committee) of the case summary on our operations to assist
   the survival of the Betancourt government in Venezuela, which was pro-
   vided to you directly by LA Division.

4. Obviously, we would prefer to forego providing this information
   to the committee. However, should it be necessary to do so, we would
   appreciate being advised promptly regarding the time and circumstances
   of any use of this material outside of the Agency.

1. Pursuant to your request, forwarded as attachment A is a paper providing examples of covert action operations targeted at right-wing governments, which is responsive to a question from the Senate Select Committee.

2. All of the cases in the attached summary are considered sensitive by the area divisions and some are considered extremely sensitive up to today. In many ways public disclosure of some of these operations could impact more severely on our foreign policy interest than the other disclosures on our foreign involvements. For example, a disclosure of our past operations in Spain could possibly adversely affect the military base negotiations now underway. With this problem in mind, we have broken the operations into two categories: Category I are those operations about which full committee could be briefed, if necessary, and Category II are those operations considered extremely sensitive about which the committee Chairman and Co-Chairman might be briefed, if absolutely necessary.

3. In addition to the attachment A summary, we also approve the use (with the full committee) of the case summary on our operations to assist the survival of the Betancourt government in Venezuela, which was provided to you directly by LA Division.

4. Obviously, we would prefer to forego providing this information to the committee. However, should it be necessary to do so, we would appreciate being advised promptly regarding the time and circumstances of any use of this material outside of the Agency.

Covert Action Operations Concerning Right-Wing Regimes

CATEGORY I

1.  ETHIOPIA: A project for covert support of the Ethiopian labor movement was first approved for FY 1965. The purpose of the support was to encourage the development of the labor movement as a democratic force and as one of the few mass representative organizations in Ethiopia. The project was terminated at the end of FY 1973. The total approved budget for this project from its inception in CY 1964 to its termination in CY 1973 was $291,006. Covert support to the Ethiopian labor movement was approved by the Special Group on 22 August 1967, on 25 March 1970, on 26 May 1971, and on 8 May 1972.

2.  SOUTH VIETNAM: From 1955 to 1975, a series of projects was begun designed to build up grass social institutions as a means of strengthening the democratic foundations of the country. One of the most long-lasting of these was aimed at supporting the soundly demo- cratic labor movement through the provision of guidance and funds to facilitate its growth among the workers and rural village peasants and tenant farmers.

3.  GUATEMALA: In 1972-73, the Guatemala City Station with access to the government succeeded in dissuading the President from military action against Belize.

4.  HAITI: As early as 1963, the Special Group discussed ways and means of influencing the Duvalier dictatorship. In 1967, a modest project was approved for the support of Haitian exile radio broadcasts for the purpose of offsetting "the inflammatory propaganda broadcasts to Haiti from Radio Habana."

5.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: In 1963, CIA was directly involved in the successful efforts to prevent the return to the Dominican Republic of General Elias Wessin y Wessin and forestall his leadership of a right- wing coup designed to prevent the holding of free elections.

6.  GERMANY: From 1948 to 1960, CIA exploited an asset in a neo- Nazi political movement both as a source of intelligence concerning its plans and actions and as a means of covertly sabotaging the movement and its European counterparts.

CATEGORY II

1.  SOUTH AFRICA: In 1959, after consultation with the Special Group, the DCI approved an overall expenditure of $165,000 to a leading South African political figure designed to encourage the creation of a new political party. This party was established in 1960. The objective was to influence the liberalization of the South African Government by having a legally constituted party in opposition to apartheid. The activity was terminated in 1962.

2.  SOUTH AFRICA: A project was initiated in 1962 to encourage the development of a multiracial trade union organization which opposed apartheid. It was funded through a European philanthropic organization. State Department approval was received in June 1963. A total of $311,705 was spent on this activity. The project was terminated in 1968.

3.  KOREA: In 1963, the Special Group approved a covert action project designed to encourage *emerging civilian government* vis-a-vis the military leadership following President Rhee's resignation and in anticipation of forthcoming elections; it proposed to support a group of National Assembly members.

4.  KOREA: The Special Group approved in 1967 a project designed to support a private, rural self-help organization to encourage more participation by rural farmers in local and national politics to increase their influence on the Government of the Republic of Korea; it involved the creation of agricultural training centers in rural villages, a news-letter and student rural services. It was terminated in 1970 as a project, but the movement has been continued under the auspices of the government.

5.  ARGENTINA: Between 1950 and 1955, efforts of the CIA were directed at countering Peron's program to obtain wide support in Latin America for his Movement of Latin American Trade Unionists (ATLAS) which was designed as one element of his campaign to expand his influence in the area. Partially as the result of CIA's efforts, the movement never caught on and it was abandoned with Peron's ouster from power.

6.  BRAZIL: From the early 1960's through the ouster of Goulart and the assumption of power by the conservative Brazilian military, to 1972, CIA supported a rural cooperative movement in the impoverished Northeast. This support was provided in spite of strong opposition to the movement first by the Goulart government and then by Brazilian military authorities in that area and in spite of the effect particularly after 1974 on liaison and diplomatic relations if this support by the USG were discovered. The project was terminated in 1972.

7. NICARAGUA: During the period 1962 to 1966, CIA participated in efforts to interdict moves by General Somoza to purchase arms for military actions against his neighbors.

8. SPAIN: In 1963, the Special Group approved a program to train 15-20 Spanish democratic labor leaders a year outside of Spain to build an effective cadre of Spanish labor leadership. In 1966, the Special Group approved a modest program designed to strengthen the Christian Democratic movement in Spain through supportive efforts with youth, political and labor elements.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Covert Action Group, Services Staff

SUBJECT : Covert Action Operations Against Right
Wing Regimes

1. Attached are revisions of the descriptions of the three covert action operations in Africa, cited in your memorandum to Mr. John Waller dated 18 July 1975.

2. In the case of Ethiopia, we understand from your discussions with Mr. Clifton Strathern that the labor project has not been eliminated from your list but that the Director will request that discussion of it be limited to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman only of the Senate Select Committee. The Director should be informed of the potentially embarrassing procedural errors in the presentation and review of this project before the 303 Committee, and the risks of exposure to two former assets who have been jailed by the new Ethiopian regime.

3. The Ethiopian labor program was undertaken without 303 Committee knowledge or approval. Subsequently, the project was presented to the 303 Committee on 22 August 1967 and Mr. Walt Rostow, then Chairman of the Security Council, asked why it had not been brought before the Committee before. He was told that for projects costing $20,000 or less, it had been the DCI's discretion to determine if a given project was sufficiently politically sensitive to warrant bringing it before the committee. Mr. Rostow directed that the 303 Committee should examine all political action projects. Nevertheless, the project was not submitted to the Committee for review in 1968, 1969 or 1973.

4. In addition to these procedural errors, the arrest in 1974 and continued detention of two Ethiopian labor leaders who are former assets under this project, and accusations in

E2 IMPDET

SECRET/SENSITIVE

the Ethiopian press that the trade union organization received
support from the U.S. Government, make any disclosure of CIA
interest in the labor organization potentially dangerous to
our former assets. Neither of the former assets was arrested
because of his CIA connections, and neither of the two assets
nor the labor organization have been accused of CIA involvement.
An admission now of CIA support to Ethiopian labor or to the
two Ethiopian labor leaders in jail could be a sentence of
death for them.

5. In the case of South Africa, CIA support to a leading
   South African political figure to encourage the creation of a
   new political party remains a very sensitive matter. The
   principal agent is still a leading and respected spokesman
   for the opposition party in South Africa and is a leading member
   of the South African parliament. Exposure of the operation
   could lead to his identification which would be extremely
   damaging to him, to the opposition party and to our govern-
   ment's relations in South Africa. For these reasons, we believe
   it would be desirable for the DCI to limit discussion of this
   operation to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Select
   Committee only.

6. The European philanthropic organization which was used
   to fund the development of a multiracial trade union organiza-
   tion in South Africa was the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES),
   located in Germany. The South African labor officials and
   organizations which received funds from FES were not aware
   that the actual origin of the funds was the United States
   Government and presumably do not now know of U.S. Government
   or CIA involvement. Aside from exposing a U.S. Government
   involvement where none is known to have existed, FES was used
   to support a number of other covert action operations in Africa
   and elsewhere and exposure of the foundation would have
   ramifications other than in South Africa. The Director should
   be briefed on FES and its range of activities on behalf of CIA
   if he has not already been informed.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. John Waller
Special Assistant to the DDO

SUBJECT : Covert Action Operations Against
Right Wing Governments

REFERENCE : Chief, SS/CAG Memorandum, dated
18 July 1975
Subject: "Summary of Covert Action
Operations Against Right Wing Governments"

1. EA Division is concerned about Reference and its possible
   use in briefing the Senate Select Committee. Specifically, our concern
   centers on describing the EA operations contained in the attachment to
   Reference as "were mounted against" "right wing governments"..
   None of the EA operations DNSCOOP, DNSPROUT (both of which
   took place in Korea) and TUMIX (which took place in Vietnam) -:
   were or should be so described as being mounted against the government
   then in power. In fact, just the opposite is true. All of these
   operations, while covert in the sense that the U.S. Government hand
   was never disclosed, were primarily designed to broaden the base of
   the governments in power and enhance its stayability by providing
   advice and support to "grass root elements" in an attempt to get these
   elements to function as a more cohesive organization in seeking
   participation in the governmental process.

2. While all of the operations have been terminated, the
   DNSCOOP operation is perhaps the most sensitive of the three, in that
   it represented an initial effort by the Agency to establish contact with
   opposition elements in South Korea. As noted above, the purpose of
   this contact was not to overthrow the ruling government but rather to
   assist the opposition in establishing itself as a more viable force in its
   effort to establish a two-party system in South Korea. The Agency today

maintains contact with the major opposition leaders in South Korea and this contact is well known to and approved by the U.S. Ambassador in Korea as well as the Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, Department of State.

3. We see no real value to be gained if any of these operations were to be raised with the Senate Select Committee.

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious security problems from arising. The following specific guidelines are considered important:

-- Members of the SSC and members of its staff should not publicly appear to be abroad for purposes of investigating CIA installations. CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under some form of cover, have and need varying degrees of protection from exposure. At one extreme are Stations behind the iron curtain or in other particularly sensitive areas which need maximum protection. At the other extreme are Stations which enjoy close liaison with the host government and are thus less sensitive. In the first case, Stations existing under strict cover conditions in sensitive environments, the very presence of SSC members could be highly provocative by flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But even in countries in which we enjoy a good liaison with the host country's security service, there remains a need to be discreet. Many countries whose services want to be cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or parliamentary exposure of the relationship. Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all cases be distastefull to a host government.

# SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 190

SECRET

- 2 -

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and with senior officers within the covering Embassy provided the SSC member does not publicly declare himself to be on SSC business and maintains his Station contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not question Station personnel on specific operational detail. It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational details are conveyed to the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide- lines are best understood, where the most complete and authentic records are kept (many Stations finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations, have periodically destroyed their files). There is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should not discuss operations in general terms - operational priorities, the kinds of operations, the operational environment, relationships with the Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not interview agent personnel. Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage could be done to agent morale and motivation if they were to think their role had been revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not in most cases be in contact with members of host country's intelligence or security services. Many services will find contact with the SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that their relationships with CIA, the information they pass us and the sort of cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 191

SECRET

- 3 -

No matter what assurances are given them, they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with the SSC or its staff, and the very fact that such matters were under investigation could well cause them to reassess the desirability of a relationship with CIA or other U.S. intelligence agencies. Exceptions can perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not visit foreign technical intelligence installations. Again there may be exceptions to this which can be arranged, but in most countries in which we operate joint technical collection sites, the host service would be opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT : Senator Gary Hart's Request to Talk
to QJWIN While Traveling in Europe

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary Hart's request to talk to a former agent while the senator is traveling in Europe.

The agent is QJWIN. He was first approached in 1958 through the head of the Luxembourg intelligence service. At first he was used mainly to spot potential agents in various European countries. Later he became the major asset under ZRRIFLE. In this capacity he made a brief visit to the Congo, but took no actions.

On the weekend of 7 June 1975, members of the Senate Select Committee staff spent many hours at Headquarters reading files, including QJWIN and ZRRIFLE, among others. QJWIN's true name contract is in the file which they read. So is a street and post office address as of 1964, the time when we ended our contract with this agent. We have not contacted him since.

We have heard that David Aaron of the Senate Select Committee staff telephoned QJWIN. This report remains unconfirmed. We have protested to Bill Miller.

It is difficult to imagine how a U.S. senator could talk to a former agent without arousing the interest of the local intelligence service (probably Luxembourg) and of the host government who might wonder about the propriety of investigations being conducted on their territory and involving one of their citizens.

In any event, an approach of this nature would be of interest to the Department of State, and the senator might wish to consult with the Department before proceeding.

Talking Points For Use With Senator Gary Hart On His Proposed
Contact With QJWYN

1. Senatorial contact with a former CIA agent would run the risk of his exposure to his local government and the press. Because of his former activities and relationships he might be subjected to reprisals from abroad, possible prosecution for espionage at home from his local government and harassment from the media.

2. Active as well as former CIA agents abroad would have further cause to believe that the American intelligence service is incapable of protecting its informants from disclosure. Contacting an agent under the insecure conditions involved would violate the Agency's promise to this former informant to protect the confidentiality of the relationship.

3. Foreign intelligence services with which the CIA is in liaison would find this approach highly unprofessional and risky. It is bound to raise further questions about the dangers of continued confidential cooperation with the CIA.

4. It is possible that the local government involved might lodge a formal protest to the US mission protesting the unusual procedure of a Senate investigating committee interrogating its nationals in violation of its sovereignty without requesting formal permission.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

This is for your information concerning Senator Gary Hart's request to talk to a former agent of ours while traveling in Europe.

You should know that we have been told that the Senate Select Committee staff has already been in touch with this agent by telephone. We do not know how they learned his true name or his whereabouts. We have already advised David Aaron of the Senate Select Committee staff of a potential problem area in connection with such a proposed meeting. The agent in question is, of course, a subject of interest to the local intelligence service and we doubt that the host government or the intelligence service would agree that a United States senator, especially a member of the Senate Select Committee, may appropriately conduct such investigations within its territory without clearance to do so.

In any event, an approach of this nature would be of interest and indeed of concern to the Department of State and the senator might be well advised to consult with them before proceeding.

For your information, the agent referred to is QJWIN and we have not been in touch with him since about 1951.

SUBJECT: GUIDELINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND
THEIR STAFFS WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD

There have been already and there will continue to be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.

I. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE
ABROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE
INSTALLATIONS.

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad, for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum protection. Ther mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence of U.S. intelligence presence within the country. Even in those countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government, care is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions that

25 June - latest version, incorporating proposed changes by DOD.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 204

2

could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison.[^1] Several foreign governments or entities thereof
now willing to cooperate privately with the U.S. in intelligence
agreements-exchanges maintain *strongly neutral* or anti-U.S. foreign
policies; continuation of such agreements-exchanges is therefore
dependent upon avoidance of their public disclosure. In many
cases termination of such agreements would result in the loss
of unique strategic intelligence, and alternate collection
methods are either not available or are prohibitively expensive.[^2]
To help maintain the discreet nature of the visit, it would be
preferable if some reason other than SSC business could be
given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff. No
deliberate contact should be made with the local press, nor
should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating
officers are contacted by the press. Local press publicity
pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas,
discreet arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S.
intelligence activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with
senior officers within the covering embassies. Such visits are
contingent upon the SSC member not publicly declaring himself
to be on SSC business at the time of the visit or upon his
return, and his proceeding on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

[^1]: ![Footnote reference 1]
[^2]: ![Footnote reference 2]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

II. THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE VISIT.

All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because
of his knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.

III. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE
CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements
will only discuss operations in general terms--operational
priorities, the kinds of operations conducted, the operational
environment, relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches,
etc. In all cases, such discussions will only be conducted in
physical surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to
see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between
the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered
by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and
operationally, and cannot be divulged without the consent of
the host government.

IV. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local
service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to be revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.

V. MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES WILL BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES.

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the information they pass, and the cooperation extended are all most sensitive matters. Regardless what assurances are given them, they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with members or staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters were under investigation could well cause the host service to reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. intelligence activities.

VI. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S. Congressional representatives, especially where there is public knowledge of the Congressional investigating interests. If such


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 207

a visit is considered essential, a special request must be negotiated with the host country in advance.

Senate Select Committee principals and staff should understand the distinction between U.S. intelligence installations abroad and joint U.S.-foreign intelligence installations or foreign intelligence installations supported by the U.S. intelligence community. Access to the former is at the discretion of the U.S. Ambassador; access to the latter two is at the discretion of the foreign government involved.

VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representatives of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize the visitor with the types of activities conducted at each location, the restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case and the considerations which preclude the discussion of operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment.

Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION

DATE AND PLACE: 17 June 1975 1000 - 1100
Room 2E-45

SUBJECT: Conversation by Mr. John Waller, SA/DDO with
Mr. David Aaron, member of Senator Mondale's
staff, with Regard to the Senator's Proposed
Trip to Europe

1. According to Mr. Aaron the Senator and Mr. Aaron's itinerary,
   while not yet fixed, will be along the following lines:

a. 30 June - 1 July: London

b. Monday, 7 June: Vienna, for one day

c. Paris and Bonn. Although the order has not yet been
determined, the Bonn stop would be two days and the
Paris stop, one day.

In the period between London and Vienna, the party intends to visit
Oslo and Helsinki. The purpose of this part of the trip, however,
has nothing to do with the SSC and the party does not want or need
Station contact.

2. Mr. Aaron agrees that in discussions with Stations, the
   party should not get into specific operational cases. They want to
   discuss "more generic" subjects: operational priorities, relations
   with the Embassy, problems, scope of liaison, operating conditions,
   etc. Their basic interests are related to "command and control".
   It had occurred to Aaron that Vienna would be a good example of a
   Station which concentrates on "East - West" operations (read third
   country, Sov and Sov Bloc operations). He recognized London was a
   liaison station. Mondale, however, was anxious to talk to Cord Meyer.

Paris, he felt, would provide some understanding of "third world" operations. Bonn, he felt, would be a good example of the inter- relations of a CIA Station with the Military and the Foreign Service.

3. Mr. Aaron stated that he had already sought out Mr. Simon of the British Embassy, requesting that contacts be arranged in London with the appropriate Foreign Office or Intelligence Offices in order to discuss the British experiences in "command and control". Aaron is also interested in how the British Official Secrets Act works. He had heard that it was proving inadequate. Mr. Aaron stated that Simon had not been enthusiastic about the idea but promised to look into it. Aaron felt that it had been better to work directly with Simon, whom he claimed to know, than to involve the Agency's go-between.

4. Mr. Aaron intended to make a similar approach to the German Embassy.

5. Mr. Waller commented that such approaches to foreign governments would make our liaison services uneasy and could adversely affect their willingness to cooperate. To this reason, we did not favor involving foreign governments -- at whatever level or wherever in the bureaucracy. Moreover, contacts with foreign governments increased the likelihood that the true purpose of the Senator's trip could leak to the press. Mr. Waller mentioned that he would want to bring this to the attention of others.

6. Mr. Aaron agreed that the Senator, through press conferences or otherwise, would not make public the fact that his trip was connected with Select Committee investigations.

7. Mr. Aaron said that he and the Senator were in touch with Mr. Hyland of the State Department with regard to this trip. He also suggested that they might get in touch with military intelligence services in Washington and in the field. He made specific reference to "Naval Intelligence".

8. Mr. Aaron stressed the fact that the itinerary was still tentative and subject to change.

9. At one point, Mr. Aaron asked if CIA had any aircraft in Europe which could be put at Senator Mondale's disposal. Mr. Waller replied negatively.

10. Mr. Aaron felt that it was unlikely that Mr. Bader would be a member of the Senator's party.

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious security problems from arising. The following specific guidelines are considered important:

-- Members of the SSC and members of its staff should not publicly appear to be abroad for purposes of investigating CIA installations. CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under some form of cover, have and need varying degrees of protection from exposure. At one extreme are Stations behind the iron curtain or in other particularly sensitive areas which need maximum protection. At the other extreme are Stations which enjoy close liaison with the host government and are thus less sensitive. In the first case, Stations existing under strict cover conditions in sensitive environments, the very presence of SSC members could be highly provocative by flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But even in countries in which we enjoy a good liaison with the host country's security service, there remains a need to be discreet. Many countries whose services want to be cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or parliamentary exposure of the relationship. Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all cases be distastefull to a host government.

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged
for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
question Station personnel on specific operational
detail. It is more fitting that Washington be the
place where operational details are conveyed to
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide-
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms -- opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the
Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
interview agent personnel. Foreign agent
personnel frequently are under hostile or
local service scrutiny. For them to be placed
in touch with SSC members would be to run an
unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage
could be done to agent morale and motivation
if they were to think their role had been
revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not
in most cases be in contact with members of
host country's intelligence or security services.
Many services will find contact with the SSC
politically difficult and will avoid it. They
further regard that their relationships with CIA,
the information they pass us and the sort of
cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

No matter what assurances are given them, they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with the SSC or its staff, and the very fact that such matters were under investigation could well cause them to reassess the desirability of a relationship with CIA or other U.S. intelligence agencies. Exceptions can perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not visit foreign technical intelligence installations. Again there may be exceptions to this which can be arranged, but in most countries in which we operate joint technical collection sites, the host service would be opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.

I. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE ABROAD FOR SOME PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE INVESTIGATION OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad, for example are under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum protection. The mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence of U.S. intelligence presence within the country. Even in those countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government, care is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 225

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the
United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public
exposure of such relationships. Some reason other than SSC business
should be given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff to
help maintain the discreet nature of the visit. No deliberate contact
should be made with the local press, nor should comments on SSC
matters be supplied if investigating officers are contacted by the
press. Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad.
would in almost all cases be distasteful to the host government.

In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet
arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence:
activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers
within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the
SSC member not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business
at the time of the visit or upon his return, and his proceeding on a
basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

Ⅱ. THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE VISIT..

All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because of his
knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 226

### III. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL

SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.

It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will only discuss operations in general terms -- operational priorities, the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment, relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all cases, such discussions will only be conducted in physical surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.

Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and operationally, and cannot be divulged without the consent of the host government.

### IV. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT PERSONNEL.

Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be

to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be
done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to be
revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.

V. MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY
SERVICES WILL BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES.

Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the SSC
politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that their
relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the information they
pass, and the cooperation extended are all most sensitive matters.
Regardless what assurances are given them, they would find it
difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with members or
staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters were under investigation
could well cause the host service to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with U.S. intelligence activities.

VI. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN
TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.

In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection sites,
the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S. Congressional
representatives, especially where there is public knowledge of the
Congressional investigating interests. If such a visit is considered

essential, a special request must be negotiated with the host country
in advance.

VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS
AND STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.

This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representatives
of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as
appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize the
visitor with the types of activities conducted at each location, the
restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case and
the considerations which preclude the discussion of operational details,
names and terms in an overseas environment.

Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that
they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition
intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff
members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly
travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

# SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad

There have been already and there will continue to be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious security problems from arising. The following specific guidelines are considered important:

-- Members of the SSC and members of its staff should not publicly appear to be abroad for purposes of investigating CIA installations. CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under some form of cover, have and need varying degrees of protection from exposure. At one extreme are Stations behind the iron curtain or in other particularly sensitive areas which need maximum protection. At the other extreme are Stations which enjoy close liaison with the host government and are thus less sensitive. In the first case, Stations existing under strict cover conditions in sensitive environments, the very presence of SSC members could be highly provocative by flaunting the fact of CIA's presence. But even in countries in which we enjoy a good liaison with the host country's security service, there remains a need to be discreet. Many countries whose services want to be cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or parliamentary exposure of the relationship. Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all cases be distastefull to a host government.

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and with senior officers within the covering Embassy provided the SSC member does not publicly declare himself to be on SSC business and maintains his Station contacts on a discreet basis.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not question Station personnel on specific operational detail. It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational details are conveyed to the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guidelines are best understood, where the most complete and authentic records are kept (many Stations finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations, have periodically destroyed their files). There is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should not discuss operations in general terms -- operational priorities, the kinds of operations, the operational environment, relationships with the Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not interview agent personnel. Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage could be done to agent morale and motivation if they were to think their role had been revealed to members of Congress.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not in most cases be in contact with members of host country's intelligence or security services. Many services will find contact with the SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that their relationships with CIA, the information they pass us and the sort of cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

No matter what assurances are given them, they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters with the SSC or its staff, and the very fact that such matters were under investigation could well cause them to reassess the desirability of a relationship with CIA or other U.S. intelligence agencies. Exceptions can perhaps be made in special cases.

Members of the SSC and their staff should not visit foreign technical intelligence installations. Again there may be exceptions to this which can be arranged, but in most countries in which we operate joint technical collection sites, the host service would be opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

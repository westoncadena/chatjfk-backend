Overt and Covert 1964 Income Tax Forms of Edward G. TICHBORN.

ACTION REQUIRED: Per Paragraph 1

REFERENCE : MEXI 5550

1. Please query Jerome H. BALSIS in regard to the location of the 1964 overt and covert tax return and payment check in the amount of $1774.00 of Edward G. TICHBORN and advise.

2. TICHBORN states that he passed the only two copies of each return and the check to BALSIS on 29 April 1965, further stating that BALSIS told him he would completely audit both returns to assure their accuracy in regard to mathematical computations and application of tax liability. BALSIS was to return a copy of the overt return for TICHBORN's retention.

3. A thorough search of Station files failed to uncover the subject tax returns and check or any transmittal record of returns or payment.

4. Since TICHBORN will be extremely hard pressed to duplicate the returns without a copy of the overt return, the location of the returns is very important.

C. HMT – 5271

1. Due to operational requirements a meeting was not held with Edward C. TICHBORN by an Admin representative, however, the items noted below were briefly discussed with him by telephone on 26 October.

2. TICHBORN was advised information would be forwarded to the Station and, upon his return to the Station, he should ask his contact about the item--both as a reminder and for fuller explanation. As will be noted, there is a time element concerned with c. below.

a. Reference A (Transmittal of hospitalization claim).
TICHBORN asked about the claim and was advised the dispatch was received 5 October and the separate cover was received by the Insurance Branch on 25 October. The insurance section has agreed to expedite the claim and it is expected Finance will advise the Station of the amount of reimbursement to TICHBORN within the next two-three weeks.

b. Reference B (Concerned signing the contract amendment forwarded by Book Dispatch 5178). The provisions of the BD regarding signing the amendment still pertain. The subject was very briefly but, by no means thoroughly, explained. In this connection, it had been planned to have him read the two attached pamphlets "Your Social Security" and Social Security Amendments--1965". If cover or operational considerations do not preclude, the pamphlets may be given to TICHBORN to either read and return to the Station or to retain.

c. Reference C (Transmitted Income Tax information in response to Book Dispatch 4659), The Tax Committee was checked regarding TICHBORS and advised they needed additional explanatory information from TICORN prior to being able to compute an assessment and bring hla under the revised tax procedures. TICHHORS could not recall sufficient facts and figures to provide the required information, lie was therefore advised it pas to his benefit to subalt the information to the Station as soon after his return as practicable.

(1) Other Income. He had indicated receipt of fees but did not state whether they were the resuit of work outside the U.S. or if they were received while in, and as a result of work in the U.S. If the fees were earned as a result of work outside the U.S., they are excludable for federal tax purposes.

(2) itemized Deductions. He had indicated under "other" $1400. but did not provide any breakdown or explanation as to what the acount represented. It is necessary to provide sufficient supporting infors-ation to enable the Comittee to recognize the amunt as an allowable ites. He also indicated a loss of $2,000 on investments. Explanatory facts are required such aso-nazes, when, reason for the loan (sale of stock at $XX versus cost of $EX or whatever), whether the loss was a carryover frua prior year(a), etc. It is better that too much information be provided rather than too little.

TICHEORN is to provide the taformation in writing with his certification as to completeness and accuracy for trans. mittal to lHeadquarters. If the information is received. within the first part of November it is like'y the revised procedures will be applied for the 1965 tax year.

Mr. Edward C. Tichborn

Dear Mr. Tichborn:

Reference is made to your current contract with the United States Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the 1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.

As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deleting all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

"Effective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Government employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an employee-employer relationship. Your legal status under this agreement continues to be that of an independent contractor."

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security credits from overt sources you will so notify this organisation and an adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this organisation. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your covert deductions returned.

All other terms and conditions of said contract remain in full force and effect.

In order to discharge this responsibility and to insure that each contract agent receives full social security credit for any self employment tax paid through the Covert Unit, it is necessary for this office to prepare the Schedule SE (Form 1040) for each taxpayer for secure transmission to the Social Security Administration. In order to complete Form SE for Subject Contract Agent, it is necessary that the following information (designated by an "X") be furnished:

X True Name (As it appears on Subject's Social Security Card)
Social Security Number

X Stateside address currently applicable or the address used when the taxpayer last resided in the U. S.

X Type of Business activity to be reflected in reporting Social Security credits from self employment, such as management consultant, translator, writer, etc.

3. Since a three year statute of limitations applies to the filing of self-employment schedules for social security coverage, it is requested that the above information be furnished as soon as possible. Any questions regarding this subject should be directed to Covert Tax Branch.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief, WH Olvision

INFO:

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: Administrative/Security -- Edward G. TICHBORN

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES: Reference: OIR-90817.

1.  The Station, after reference incident, felt more strongly than ever that it really did not have a complete assessment of TICHBORN in the sense of what is his real ideological viewpoint. This is not to say that the Station was overly concerned that TICHBORN was flirting with the opposition. As a result of the events described below, the Station feels it has a reasonably clear idea on these points now.

2.  On 15 May, being a Saturday and two days prior to TICHBORN entering a Mexican hospital for a long-delayed and somewhat apprehensive (on his part) hernia operation, TICHBORN was in an unusually loquacious mood for a luncheon engagement with the Station case officer. He showed little opposition to three good Manhattans and, for the first time, the Station case officer felt he was seeing clearly TICHBORN "the person" and not TICHBORN "the lawyer". In other words, there was no protective veneer involved in the rather long luncheon discussion which followed. The issue which brought forth the entire discussion was reaction of the Mexican intellectual to the Dominican Republic situation. In the process, TICHBORN brought out very sincerely, passionately, and clearly the following points:

a. When he was a trial lawyer in California for five years, his real inclinations were what he termed "leftist". He harbored a number of "reservations" about the way that things were or were not happening in the U.S. under the U.S. system. These were private thoughts and reservations and did not translate.

themselves into action, but nonetheless points of real concern to him. Then, he came to Mexico for a period to get "that" novel and writing off his chest: during that period, he saw the Mexican system and some of the Latin American Systems. At that juncture, he became very much awarelof the fact that it was the "system" that counted, in spite of whatever Imperfections existed, and that there "was, and is, nothing that can anywhere nearly approach the U.S. system". As he said, "Sure, there are a lot of things wrong because of decisions made by human beings who are fallible and have their own interests to look after, but there is so much good and so many compensations on the plus side of the system and the way it works, you can afford to recognize the wrongs and work them out within the system". He said that this was so obvious from abroad that he just wondered why he ever had worried about Incidents and didn't realize that it was the "system" that mattered.

b. He told about some of the discussions he had had with leftist Mexican intellectuals on these points such as, "Is the Soviet system capable of producing and absorbing such pictures as 'Dr. Strangelove' or having a John Steinbeck write a 'Grapes of Wrath' and run off with all prizes in the writing and motion picture field? Can you even approximate that in Mexico? Witness the furore over 'The Children of Sanchez' here while the 'Grapes of Wrath' was every bit as harsh with respect to similar circumstances in the U.S. and won everything." On and on. In so many words, our system thrives on "self-criticism", and there are things to criticize, but what other system in this world is not only permissive of that, but thrives on it. And so on. He has no doubts about any governmental/social/political/economic system in any combinatlon being able to even approach it.

3. The foregoing is a very brief synopsis of a rambling and long philosophic discussion on these points in which TICHBORN concluded his statement and, even, tirade (his Latin heritage had gotten the better of him at that point) with the statement that "My philosophy on this point, and my present sentiments, have been forged in the fire of thinking as a leftist critic and having come to see and understand a great deal, and they can't tell me a damn thing about what is the best system nor on the basis of their present circumstances in their own countries have they any right or basis for criticizing the U.S. and its actions. Nothing is perfect, and I can't defend it as being perfect, but for every imperfection they try to show me in the U.S. and what it has or has not done, I can show them hundreds in their country and any other one they try to hold up as a model."

4. In so many words, at least the Station case officer at the present time is satisfied in his own mind that TICHSORN was speaking sincerely during this discussion and there is no question in the Station's mind about where TICHBORN stands ideologically even though he may be considered "left of center."

5. Since this issue seems to hover constantly in the background with TICHBORN insofar as KUSARK is concerned, the Station felt it would be a good idea to register the foregoing incluent and appraisal with Headquarters.

SUBJECT: ADMINISTRATIVE/FINANCE Loss of Personal Funds - Eduard a mhuriy

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:

REFERENCE: HS-3132, 22 April 1964

1.  The delay in answering reference should not be construed as lack of desire or intent, on the mrt of TICEKON or the Chief of Station, that the case be submitted to the Board of Review for Shortages and Losses for consideration, but rather as an administrative delay of getting the facts, people, papers, etc., together and in one place for submission.

2.  Attached is a statement prepared by TICIBORN regarding the loss of funds and containing the pertinent circumstances of the case. The sub-cara seph numberings are in accordance with, and relating to, the requirements of paracraph 3, a of FR 34-250. The information requested in sut-paragraphs numbered & through 12 is answered jointly by Stewart R. FATAKER and Jerome H. BALSIS who were assigned to investigate the ratter by the reporting official.

3.  PATANER and BALSIS talked with TICHCR!, at different times, regarding the shortage of funds and the momenines as related to then were substantially the same as outlined in TICHBORN's staterent. Since there is no other way to verify the facts and TICHICAN has proven himself to te truthful and forthright in his dealings with the Station his staterent regarding the loss of faxis is accepted as fact.

4.  Since TICIBORN is authorized travel expense "on actual, reasonable, and necessary expense basis" it does not seem sensible for him to have reported the loss of funds in other than the way he says actually happened.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Station, Mexico City

FROM: Chief, WHD

SUBJECT: Contract Amendment Edward G. TICHBORN

Reference: DIR 67851

Action Required: FYI

1.  Forwarded herewith is the referenced amendment Edward G. TICHBORN'S contract which provides for a one year extension effective 19 November 1964 and a compensation increase from $9,000 to $12,000.

2.  During Subject's recent TDY in Washington it was made clear to him that this substantial pay raise and extension of his contract was on the basis that TICHBORN continue to devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity. In view of the fact that Subject is currently handling only one intellectual project for the Station, please explain to him that in the event that his work load reverts to the 50 to 65% level, he cannot expect to continue to receive the present amount of compensation. During Subject's talks at Headquarters, it appeared that TICHBORN understands this most clearly. As a contract agent, he is renumerated on the basis of services rendered, In return for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on incomo he might receive from his private business activities. Obviously it is our hope that coupled with the occasional full-time assignments in other WH countries levied on TICHBORN, that the Station will be able to continue to utilize Subject's services at the high level of activity which will justify his current compensation.

REFERENCE: HMMS-3952, dated 15 January 1965

1. Referenced dispatch has caused TICHBORN and the Station to become aware of some new problems with the Mexican banking system. As Headquarters may not be aware, TICHBORN has a dollar account with a Mexico City bank for his personel affairs. Maxican banke do not return cancelled checks to the depositor, but only provide statemence. TICHBORN requcated his bank to provide him with his cancelled check (on a loan basis) so that copies could be saade of it. It developed over a procese of several weaks that the bank could not locate this chock nor had it been run through TICHBORN's account. Since ample time had expired (it was mailed in June 1964), the bank checked.. all accounts of persons with TICHBORN's last name on the theory that it might have been run through someone else's account (not an unusual occurrence here). It had not that the bank could discover.

2. As a result, TICHBORN is stopping payment on the check with the bank, writing the office with which he filed his overt income tax, advising that office of the circumstances, and requesting some word back whether or not, in fact, that office received, and cashed the check. If the check van received, TICKBORN will provide the Station with a copy of the letter 90 stating and resove the "stop payment" order on the check. If the check was not received (mail is another problem), then TICHBORN will send another check and a copy of the interchange of correspondence on the matter with the bank and the income tax authorities will be provided Headquarters. It is hoped this will be satisfactory.

3. The only reason the Station is providing all the gruesome details on the foregoing is so that Headquarters will have some understanding of the Mexican banking problems should questions of this nature arise again.

Edward G. TIMSON, Covert Income Tax Return

F2SF-5111 dated 17 December 1964

1. Headquarters review of YERNE's 1963 overt and covert tax return revealed that he reported his covert income on the overt return and that the tax computation on the overt return was incorrect. The overt return appears to be correct, however, it will be necessary subject to advise headquarters whether correspondence has been released from IRS regarding the apparent error in the overt tax computation.

2. It is, generally, the rule that a copy of the cancelled check, in payment of the overt tax liability, be forwarded to Headquarters when covert income is reported on the overt return.

3. It would be appreciated if subject would forward his cancelled check, or a copy thereof, with the above requested information.

Dear Fr.. Thomas:

Due to increased demands upon my time from other clients, I find it necessary to relinquish my duties as legal counsel for the IILR here in Mexico, and I do so with great reluctence. One of my theretofore-lesser clients has recently expanded his activities in certain real estate developments in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, thereby necessitating frequent absence from Mexico City. Then, too, I had underestimated the amount of time and effort required to satisfactorily attend the various legal and administrative matters confronting CEDS. Should you so desire, I could recommend other legal counsel; but I em inclined to feel that the Centro's principal problems would be of an administrative nature rather then a legal one.

As for my legal fees to date, I am submitting a bill for $650.00 U.S. Cy. This represents a total of 65 hours at the rate of $10.00 per hour. My regular fees amount to $20.00 per hour, but, in keeping with my own political affinity for labor couses, I have reduced them to the lesser figure.

May I thank you again for your confidence and good will in heving choser me es legal counsel for your organization's activities ir. Mexico. I shall be happy to give you a personal report of my observations on my next trip to New York.

Sincerely yours,

Henry P. Lopez

REFERENCE: HMMA-24456 dated 8 Oct 64.

1. As Headquarters is aware, Edward G. TICHBORN is in Mexico on a tourist visa and with a number of "associations" (i.e., law firm in PBPRIME, TV and movie contacts in Mexico) which have sufficed to provide satisfactory superficial cover for his presence and activities here up to this time. However, he has been here long enough now and made enough trips to other Latin American countries where a concinuation of this tourist status and present cover arrangements should be changed for something more substantial. All of this became apparent when he began to try to obtain his working papers. TICHBORN's profession, of course, is that of a lawyer, but he cannot practice this profession in Mexico under Mexican-law. Therefore, to find a peg for working paper approval, something else had to be found. None of his numerous present cover associations or stories had enough substance to provide a sufficiently plausible basis for working papers. The corporation being created for the QRMANTLE activity under the cover story being used (e.g., fairly affluent PBPRIMER interested in culture and intellectuals trying to get something of the OEMANTLE acture started and, then,_interest PBPRIME foundations in picking it up) will not support an application for working papers. As a result, the Station and TICHBORN were casting about for something else with more depth and durability.

2. During the weck of 27 September, an old friend of TICHBORN's, Identity A, came up with the following proposition:

a. Identity A owns Identity B which operates out of Mexico City and distributes PBPRIME shows dubbed into Spanish throughout the Caribbear and South American area. The business has been in existence for some time and, according to TICHBORN, is thriving. Identity A said that his business had reached a point where he needed legal assistance of various types, but was not prepared to turn it over to just any local lawyer since it involved a wide range of problems.

b. Identity A, who knew from conversations with TICHBORN that the latter was thinking about getting Mexican working papers, made an offer to TICHBORN. He said that he would provide TICHBORN with office space and telephone in his present office area in downtown Mexico City on Reforma if TICHBORN would just advise him on what local lawyers to see on these various legal problems and act as a very general legal advisor to him on dealings with these people. He and TICHBORN figured this would take, perhaps, 5% of the latter's time.. Further, and most important; Identity A said he would provide the basis with Identity B for TICHBORN obtaining his working papers. For various reasons, however, Identity A desired an answer right away (within several days).

3. The Station checked out Identity A in Station files and found that there had been some previous traffic on him in the period, 1957-61: HDC-W-334 dated 19 December 1957; HMM-A-9445 dated 12 February 1958; DIR-40866 dated 20 May 1961; DIR-41304 dated 22 May 1961; DIR-1303 dated 23 May 1961; DIR- 41298 dated 23 May 1961; and MEXI-8085 dated 23 May 1961. As will be noted, the May 1961 traffic concerned TICHBORN coming to Mexico and being employed as legal counsel to Identity A. (This never really reached fruition although TICHBORN used an association with Identity A, which was never more than close social contact and an interest in show business, as one of his various cover stories.) In all this traffic, there was not any derogatory information developed on. Identity A. Therefore, the Station on strength of the timing required and this previous traffic told TICHBORN to go ahead with the arrangement since it is not only essential for his local activities, but will provide him with stronger and readily available cover for any further Latin American trips (i.e., FUASPEN) he might be required to make. TICHBORN has been cold, to transact an absclute minimum of his business for KUBARK at this office on his regular projects. (e.g., QRMINE and QRMANTLE).

4.. Hopefully, this will also straighten out the working papers problem on some sort ef rational basis in the near future.

Specific - Edward G. TICHBORN Contract

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:
201-253203

REFERENCE: HMMA-24352, dated 22 September 1964.

1. As probably can be discerned from previous communications on this subject, the Station has never been too certain about the original understandings with Subject on his relationship with KUBARK. At least some understandings have been supplementary to the formal contract (such as, his availability for extended trips to Latin American areas in election periods). This is no complaint on the part of the Station, but merely a prelude to a matter which the Station brought up with TICHBORN in connection with his intellectual magazine and QRMINE activities.

2. It has been the Station's inference, from talking to TICHBORN as well as comunications on other aspects of his relationship with KUBARK not covered in his contract, that he is not to be considered a full-time contract agent. In other words, he has outside activities in the legal and other fields here which it was understood would provide additional income to him at the time he entered into his original relationship with KUBARK. As can be discerned from his biographic data, he has operated at a level and enjoyed an income outlook that would not be satisfied by the present contractual arrangements on salary. It has become obvious to the Station, however, that if he is to handle, properly, present requirements being imposed on him by the Station a very high percentage of his available time is going to be involved.

3. Taking all the foregoing into consideration and to avoid complications with his present projects or TICHBORN, the Station asked him what understanding ho had on the proportion of his time to be devoted to KUBARK activities. He said that his present contract was predicated on approximately 60 to 86-2/3t of his time being utilized by KUBARK. His present estimate is that he is devoting 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activities; and, if he is to do the kind of job that is desired on the two intellectual projects recently acquired, he will sustain that percentage. Of course, he continues to be available for appropriate election of political assignments (such as FUASPEN) in other countries from time to time; but, it has to be recognized that when he is absent from Mexico, this represents 100% of his time.

4. The Station agrees with his analysis on current commitments against his time on behalf of KUBARK. Therefore, it was indicated to TICHBORN that he should be prepared to take up this matter with Headquarters at the time ha makes his late October trip to PBPRIME in connection with the new intellectual magazine (see reference) and that the Station would request Headquarters to de prepared to discuss the matter at that time. It is the Station's_understanding that his present contract extension expires 19 November 1964.

5. The Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at its initiative in order to try (n) to assure that demands being placed on TICHBORN recently could be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) to get a complete understanding on all aspects of TICHBORN's contractual status (ritten and unwritten) so that neither the Station nor TICHBORN get committed to these continuing activities and suddenly find themselves in contention about the time/salary involved. It should also be emphasized that TICHBORN has not complained about recent requirements, but has devoted whatever time required to handle them and do the job expected.

AS INDICATED IN REF B IN MID-1962, IT WAS STATION UNDERSTANDING UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY THAT TICHBURN'S PRIMARY MISSION HERE WAS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ELECTION AND OTHER POLITICAL ACTION ASSIGNMENTS IN HEMISPHERE FOR, IF NEED BE, EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. IN SO MANY WORDS, HE ASSIGNED HERE FOR LA BASE OPERATIONS WITH MEXI HAVING RIGHT USE HIM WITHIN THOSE LIMITATIONS. OBVIOUSLY, MEXI COULD NOT SADDLE HIM WITH NORMAL AMOUNT OF PROJECTS REQUIRING ROUTINE AND ASSURED MANAGEMENT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, USED HIM FOR NUMBER ONE-SHOT AND TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENTS PLUS INITIALTING AND HANDLING PROJECT LIFIZZ WHICH AS MUCH AS STATION FELT COULD BE DONE WITHOUT TYING HIM DOWN TOO MUCH. REF C IN MID 1963 APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED THAT STATION WAS USING HIM SOMEWHAT MORE THAN ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED. PROJECT LICCLIC NOTED HE WOULD NOT BE HANDLING INTELLECTUAL JOURNAL PROJECT.PROJECT LIFIZZ OR SOME REPLACEMENT, PLUS REMAINING AVAIL FOR SHORT-CURATION POLITICAL ACTION ASSIGNMENTS IN OTHER AREAS.

ALTHOUGH AT STATION REQUEST TICHBORN HAS DEALT IN MEXI WITH PERSONS OF FAR LEFT, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION THAT HIS POLITICAL INCLINATIONS ARE ANYTHING BUT COMPLETELY PRO-PSPRIME. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT HIS ABILITY AT ANY CHORE INTERESTING ENOUGH TO STIMULATE HIM. HE IS EXTREMELY LUCID, AND HIS MIND CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS BRILLIANT. HE HAS AN EVEN, PLACID TEMPERAMENT. HIS JUDGEMENT APPEARS TO BE SOUND (ALTHOUGH IN MEXI HIS ASSIGNMENTS HAVE USUALLY BEEN OF THE TYPE IN WHICH HE FOLLOWED STATION GUIDANCE).

HE IS NOT GOOD AT DETAIL, SUCH AS REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING. IN ESSENCE, HE IS A SHARP OPERATOR, WHO COULD PROBABLY DO WELL IN POSITION OF IMPORTANCE.

2. STATION NOT IN POSITION TO COMMENT ON HIS LEGAL ABILITY. HIS LOCAL ACTIVITY FALLS IN THE PUBLIC RELATIONS CATEGORY (AS A PSPRIME CITIZEN HE NOT ALLOWED PRACTICE MEXID).

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Station, Mexico City

FROM: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: KUWOLF/Edward O. TICHBORN (ps)

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

ACT: Cable comments on Contract renewal and amendment

1. While TICHBORN was at Headquarters in April, he said he needed $4,000 per year more than the $8,000 plus expenses he receives under his present contract. He cited the high cost of life insurance he must take out for all his air flights, since he does not receive KUBARK rights of survivorship as a Contract Agent. He also mentioned the rising cost of living in Mexico, and the increased amount of time he is spending on behalf of KUBARK, at the expense of his cover. He said that his financial situation will soon force him to spend more time on his law practice, limiting his availability to KUBARK.

2. Headquarters thinks highly of TICHBORN, and we regard him as an excellent long time asset who might possibly be converted to career agent in the future, when his legal practice is less lucrative, or he chooses to work almost full time for KUBARK.

3. Meanwhile, Headquarters believes that the fairest arrangement for KUBANK and for TICHBORN, would be to keep him in contract status, raising his salary. This would ensure KUBARK's continued utilization of his valuable services, would assure the maintenance of a strong cover, and at the same time would give TICHBORN the incentive to work hard at his cover and would permit him to realize the return from his cover efforts. If TICHBORN were converted to Career Agent status now, there would be almost, if not total offset of his cover income.

1. Station Mexico regrets that, to date, it has been unable to obtain the Reference report from Tichborn. As Headquarters is aware, Tichborn, while brilliant and articulate, is not always dependable, especially when it comes to routine tasks. It is true, however, that Tichborn has been extremely busy traveling for KUBARK, and is at the moment on another of his frequent trips.

2. In any event, Tichborn has promised to provide the report as soon as he returns from his present trip. It will be forwarded when received from him.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Contract Personnel Division

SUBJECT: Edward O. TICHBORN (p), Contract Amendment

1. It is requested that the contract for Edward O. TICHBORN, Contract Agent, be amended to delete the current paragraph 2. Travel and Operational Expenses and insert:

"2. Travel and Operational Expenses. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds on an actual, reasonable and necessary expense basis for those expenses incurred by you in connection with such travel or may be directed or authorised by the Government and while on temporary duty away from your permanent post of assignment. In addition, you will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary operational expenses as specifically approved by the Government. Payment and accounting for all expenses incurred hereunder will be in substantial conformance with applicable Government regulations."

The effective date of the amendment should be as of the effective date of the contract, 19 May 1961.

2. The above request is corrective in nature as it was not intended to change the travel expense provision which had been in effect during his previous contract.

# TICKBORN

19 March 1963

Paul 0:

Tichborns original contract provided for travel on an actual expense basis. This was when he was working on a daily or job rate basis.

This contract was terminated and a new contract was written In May 1961. He was given $8,000 per year, and the reimbursement for operational travel section reads "This may include per diem in lieu of subsistence---".

None of Tichborn's travel claims have been processed since the new contract has been effective. All travel claims submitted by him starting in June 1961 have been submitted on an actual expense basis.

Finance takes the view that the "This may include per diem---" as restricting Tichborn to per diem only plus of course operational expenses. Processing Tichborns old accounts on this basis would require him to refund several hundred dollars.

An ammendment to the contract would take care of these old accounts as submitted.

Options:

1. Get refund from Tichborn
2. Ammend contract to cover actual expenses to present date.
3. Ammend contract to cover actual expenses past and future.

What are your wishes?

Currie

Avoid any action that would require refund - this works out at 2 or 3 with WH/34 - select most equitable and operational, justifiable arrangement. pe 201-253203

RE: "433"-CHECK Y ONE
MARKED FOR INDEXING
NO INDEXING REQUIRED
INDEXING CAN BE JUDGED BY QUALIFIED HQ DESK ONLY

1.  Referenced dispatch was discussed with the Ambassador on 6 March. He said that in talking with Oliver O. GALBOND and others in Headquarters in early 1962 as well as with Chief, DYVOUR support, he had expressed great appreciation for the assistance rendered by Edward G. TICHBORN. He said that he still felt that a similar survey, made a year or so after the first one, would be most helpful in assessing significant changes in the outlook of the various segments of Salvadoran society. Also discussed was the possible utility of an early April 1962 survey on the issues and personalities as they might develop during the forthcoming elections, presently scheduled for 29 April 1962. However, the Ambassador concluded that he was, of course, aware that there are other priority needs for TICHBORN's services.

2.  While the Station would welcome another visit by subject, it does not appear that the need for a general survey is so pressing as it was a year ago. It is doubted that basic conditions have changed greatly, and the changes which have taken place have been fairly well covered in CDACID reporting. With regard to the pre-election estimate, mentioned above, it should be noted that there are no other parties to date in the field except the government party, the Partido Conciliacion Nacional (PCN), and only the PCN has thus far put forward candidates for President and Vice President. Unless postponed, the closing date for announcements is 12 March. In other words, at the moment it appears that the net result of the overwhelming victory of the PCN in the elections of last December has made the forthcoming elections a mere formality.

3.  The Station will appreciate early advice of a second visit by TICHBORN, if his schedule permits.

# DISPATCH

FROM: Chief of Station, Marido City

SUBJECT: Availability of TICHKIN and REDLICH for JAMURA

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES: EW-10859, 20 August 1962

1. Edward B. TICHKIN is available at any time for JAMURA travel. Trips of more than five weeks would be difficult, both for the Station and for TICHKIN. (He is currently handling operation LIRICA, which is so sensitive that the Station would be reluctant to use an interim cut-out).

2. In the case of Leo C. REDLICH, he can of course be released as requested by Headquarters for JAMURA. His absence will, as previously noted, work considerable hardship on the Station's current RUACLY program. REDLICH handles LIEMCOB, which takes very little time; AMEARD-16, which takes considerable time; and 1200AX, which is almost a full-time job. In the latter project, for instance, he meets with his principal agents almost daily, and with his Station case officer at least five times a week. It would be extremely difficult to release him during the six-week period immediately prior to elections at the National University each year (usually September, October). Since REDLICH, in his cover capacity, is active as a professor, as much lead time as possible is requested prior to travel requests. As an example, REDLICH is already signed up to deliver lectures in Monterrey in November of this year. Reference dispatch says travel for JAMURA would require a minimum of three weeks, but does not mention the possible maximum. Primarily for cover reasons, and secondarily for operational reasons, the Station feels that any travel lasting more than four weeks would be almost impossible to accept. In spite of the above restrictions the Station will, of course, release REDLICH at any time for any period if Headquarters feels his contribution will be greater elsewhere.

Political System Analysis for Election Planning - JMTTEA

1. There are a number of countries where we want to begin detailed political system analyses as a basis for election planning. To have a "nuts and bolts" examination of the building blocks of the political parties and the political systems and in countries such as Peru and Chile among others.

2. While planning of the above is at this stage still tentative, we would like an indication from Mexico and San Juan Stations as to the availability of YICHOACH and RESLICK (separately) in Mexico and SKIARR-1 in Puerto Rico to go on such survey missions for a minimum of 3 weeks sometime during the next 4 months. We understand that Mexico Station would much prefer that we use YICHOACH rather than RESLICK for this type of survey but we would like to test the capabilities of RESLICK in this field if it is at all possible to break him loose from his current activities.

3. Addresses' comments are solicited.

DISPATCH


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 139

6 August 1962

The following information was derived from a transcription of a tape made during a meeting with Edward TICHBORN in early June 1962 in Washington, D.C. The purpose of the meeting was to debrief TICHBORN concerning his opinions and experiences gained from a recent trip to El Salvador. TICHBORN spoke from notes for the first part of his report (pp 1-6) and answered specific questions for the remainder.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 140

TRANSCRIPTION

I would like to go into several of the things that I have previously covered in my report, First of all, I am happy to say that the radio schools started by DURON'S Group seemed to have gotten off to a very good start. There have been about 100 sets distributed so that there are about now something like 10,481 students enrolled in 1,000 of the radio schools. It's apparently had very good success. They publish books that go along with the radio classes. As you probably will remember, there was a literacy campaign that was fashioned after the idea that was promulgated by Father SALCEDO In Columbia. Interesting to me is the fact that the : radio schools have received about 1,400 letters with suggestions and praise and various other commentaries. One of the problems they are having right now is there isn't a transmitter power- ful enough to get much beyond the capital. I understand that a transmitter is on route and it would cortainly be a big boon to then. It seems to me that the radio is probably the most offective way of getting out to the groups in the out- lying arons. There are no newspapers to speak of, and once you get the listeners hocked on the radio, then of course, you can go from literacy campaigns into various other things wo have in mind. Incidently, these redlos as you probably realize are on a fixed frequency, and the program is lead by a priest, named Father Manuel MOLINA SIERRA.

: Speaking about the priest, it is interesting to note that there has apparently been a considerable shift in the attitude of the Catholic Church with respect to reforms in San Salvador. It would not be surprising to note that this Is probably a fHemisphere-wide, if not a world-wide attitude on the part of l'opo John, the 23rd. You might even kind of correlate this to what is happening in Spain and also in Portugual. In El Salvador, itself, the Bishop issued a lotter sometime back with the last several months calling for social reforms and for immediate changes within the social structure Lof: El Salvador. As. I mentioned to you earlier, it caused considerable consternation with the so-called ruling 14. As a matter of fact, the ambassador mentioned to me that they have been complaining recently that they have lost the big three pillars of strength that they had, the army, the Church, and the American Embassy. As was predictable and I think I mentioned this in my last report, the so-called 14. and some of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

-2-

the less wealthy people in El Salvador have looked askance at the Alliance for Fropress. I think you will remember that in my last report I predicted that we would have problems with respect to many reforms if they were to be the sine qua non of aid from the United States.

With respect to the Church, I think it might be a good Idea to give some very detailed study as to how we can exploit to the best possible extent, the apparent change within the Church not only in El Salvador but all over Latin America. I think that it might be a thing that wo should sit around or someone sit around for a considerable time trying to analyze all the ins and outs, and how we can fit this into the whole program of action in Latin America.

Now you ask me in our informal chats about the structure of these as far as the nationalities of the people involved in the hierarchy. I think it's in the upper structure, Spaniards and Italians, but in the lower structures most of the people are from El Salvador and some from Guatemala and that their natural inclination would be to go with the people. I think I mentioned in my earlier report that very frequently the priests in their early Massos (say at 5:00, 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. would be attonded naturally by the low-income groups) would ask for social changes and reforms. At the later Masses, they would change the attitudes of their sermons because of the different economic complex of the people attending church. It's interesting to note that the Bishop's letter that was issued with respect to reforms got a very angry reaction from the 14.

Now one of the things that I note with respect to the general political atmosphere in San Salvador is that there seems to be a considerable confusion among the people with respect to some of these reforms. Let's take for example, the minimum salary. It is one of the cornerstones of reform by the present ruling JUNTA, and it will be carried through by President-elect RIVERA. As of right now, there seems to be a very calculated campaign on the part of business and on the part of financiers to confuse the people, and they have done a good job of it. I remember talking to many people asking then candidly, "what is this minimum salary all about?" Many of them told me the government has decided that they can be paid only so much and no more. In other words, they have really converted it into an idea that this is maximum salary. Also there has been a considerable laying off of all people in certain


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

-3-

factories and the reason being givon, that the government now
wakes it impossible for us to keoj a full staff, and therefore
we are reducing. This, of course, could have very serious
effects on any ability of the government to carry through its
reforms with respect to minimum wage. Interesting enough,
there are even people in the lower classes, who having been
confused by what it means, are vory definitely against the
whole idea of minimum wage. I think, here again, it is a
necessity for the Covernment either to acquire a newspaper or
to buy a considerable interest in one of them and also to do
a job of publicizing and getting the message across with
respect to the general class of laborers. However, I anticipate
that this difficulty--that the people, with the economic pover,
are in a good position to at least partially sabotage this
particular reform by the simple expedient of just laying people
off and blaming it on the government. Let's face it, with
respect to political reform in Latin America, the thing that
is most meaningful to people is not political liberty, but
"bread in the belly." we have got to constantly bear in mind
that when we, with our own criteria of political liberties here
in the United States, go into Latin America we have got to
realize that sometimes the right to vote and the right to express
our views is a meaningless concept to a peasant who really is
worried about whether he gets one tortilla or two tortilias;
it's the bread that is the biggest political factor in any part
of Latin America. In this respect, it is interesting to note
that whereas the last time I was in El Salvador there WAS A
lot of talk about Fidel Castro that was just kind of spontaneous
and extemporaneous on the part of some several hundred people
that I talked to. This time I also went through many of the
low-income barrios out in the countryside and talked to a great
number of people, and a great number of them kept mentioning
Martinez who was the president for about 10 to 12 years back,
1934 to 45, Many of them, particularly, the older people
spoke rathor nostalgically about the times of Martinez when
thore wore jobs and when the prices were low and when even
though the wages were low, you could buy a full meal and could
get comparatively comfortable housing. Of course, it is
known that Martinez is one of the worst tyrants that they have
had there; and for a long time the thing they remember is not
the repressive measures that he took, not the number of people
that were slaughtered under his orders. The thing that is
remembered now rostly is the fact that there were more jobs,
that the prices were low, etc. We've got to constantly bear:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 143

in mind that the things that are mostly meaningful to these groups of people is whether they are working, the price structure, and just the general bare economic needs that are met by any government. I want to talk now for a moment about the Alianza para Progresso and some of my impressions about how it's doing, not only in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and some of the other countries that i observed. One of the most immediate isopressions that I get is during the last few months is that the Alianza para Progresse has been terribly over publicized. I think we made a serious mistake in arousing expectations in Latin America that may not be met. As a Batter of fact. I know from talking with many of the people there that the expectations they have simply are not within the reckoning of what the United States has planned. I even think it's unfortunate if we have a slogen, that the Alianza para Progresso as a slogan is open to serious attacks both humorously and satirically. As a matter of fact, already many people even our friends are beginning to use the slogan by way of criticism. I have in mind recently, that the foreign minister of Honduras was in Mexico and in a public statement said, "we have a lot of alliance but no progress." And of course in the schools in El Salvador, there are all kinds of turnings about twisting the words around by way of criticism.

What I mean by over publicizing and sloganizing is the fact that almost all over Latin America, the newspapers are reporting an outpouring of millions and millions of dollars, and as you might expect they convert the figures into pesos, or other local currency whatever you happen to be, so that there is an announcement saying that the Alianza para Progresso has allocated 10 million dollars and then they convert that into 120 million pesos; it sounds like an awful lot of money. Immediately people have grandioso ideas about what is going to be done with all this money when in effect it is only a request for that kind of money that has been done. We have, basically speaking, still some problems among Congress as to how much soney is going to be allocated. Let me give you a specific case about what I feel is an over publicizing of the Alliance's program. In El Salvador there was an announce- went in the papers that three million dollars had been ailo- cated by the United States Covernment for the building of schools. Now, 3 million dollars converted into local currency is something like seven and half million colones. That's a big sum of money down there and, of course, it got tremendous play in all the newspapers. Well it turned out, what the Alliance had in sind, along with the Junta, was to build ore hundred small schools. This would be 100 schools worth around $30.000 a piece. Well, one of the model schools, right now, is in the process of constructions in one of the neigh- borhoods in El Salvador. While I was there, there was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 144

considerable snide criticism by the press; by a lot of the population that this was a poor example of Alliance for Progress spending. It was a small school; it was within the desired $30,000 budget, but I am thinking that eest of the people in El Salvador having talked about 7,500,000 colones, were expecting palaces to be built. Suddenly you have a very small school, and it was being criticized by the press; by the people at large. The next day, quite fortunately, the Minister of Education very ably took this issue and quieted it by saying: "Ne said we are going to build schools, not palaces." But I think that even this criticise could have been avoided had we announced rather that the expenditure of 3 million dollars or 7,500,000 colones, had we just announced that the Alliance for Progress, in cooperation with the El Salvador government, was going to build 100 small schools and say so without any more dressing it up, not even mentice the acount of money that was going to be spent in total because then no one could expect more than a small school. Also I think it would have been better to have the first schools outside El Salvador, possibly in a little town like Santa Techia or one of the other neighboring towns; and then build the school right next to the old school so that there would be a marked contrast in every way. You could see it immediately. Certainly there is always land available near all the old schools, and Just destroy the old school when you've built the new one; and then really to do a public relations job, get statements from the teachers, from the students, and, perhaps, have the oldest school teacher in the neighborhood lay the cornerstone to the school. Really do a public relations job of it en a very personal basis rather than trying to stagger people with huge sums of money. This is what I mean by talking in huge figures when you can do a better job and arouse less expectation.. When you have few expectations, almost anything is better; so I think if we talk little and act big, we're going to be much better off in the long run.

I think also a very highly over publicized group is the Peace Corps. Here again, I think we're setting curselves up for some possible difficulty. All of this publicizing is very good for consumption here in the United States; but in the world we're living in now, the same kind of propaganda gets outside the United States, Already there are all kinds of jokes about the Pesce Corps. Its done a terrific job of publicizing here in this country. They get great coverage in


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 145

all the big picture magazines. In time there's going to be a musical comedy about the Peace Corps. All this is great stuff as far as the United States is concerned, but I'm afraid it is going to create serious problems abroad. Actually the actual observable benefit of the Peace Corps in the various areas will be very minimal when you consider, for example, they have about 29 people that will be in the Peace Corp in San Salvador. They're not going to be able to make much of a dent in separate communities, because they are separated. As I understand it, from talking to the manager of the Peace Corps for the Contral American area; most of these kids will be alone in the villages they are going to, and whatever they do is not going to be very observable as far as the general population is concerned. Unfortunately, one of the things that we haven't yet learned in our thinking about these under-developed countries is the fact that we do such naive things as this: there is an elderly lady about 63 years of age that has been assigned to one of the small villages in southern El Salvador and her expertise is home economics. If you have ever been to one of these small villages and if you have seen that they subsist, and I say subsist, merely on a small supply of beans and maybe one or two tortillas; and the difference between the supply of one or two tortillas is a very meaningful one. When you start talking about balancing the diet and varying the diet and having a home economics expert to teach them this, this gets pretty ironic. This is precisely the thing that could easily be open to criticism and easily open to satire. I can imagine if I were someone in a position of Dr. Jose Rodriguez RUIZ, who was a very left leaning Dean of the School of Economics, in El Salvador--if I really wanted to cede on one issue and ridicule it, I would talk about this person who was an expert on home economics; balanced dieting; and how many vegetables you should have; what variety of vegetables, how much cottage cheese you should have; and the whole thing in the balanced diet. I could murder this whole thing in very short time and make it very ridiculous.

I think these are things that we've got to think about. We've got to think about all the possible weaknesses, how this thing can be turned around. I know that in the United States, I know that in the hometown of this woman (she's from Nebraska) it sounds absolutely marvelous and this home economics expert is going down to a little Latin American country and tell them all about home economics, but from the point of view of the Latin American it's sheer irony and it's susceptible to attack.

with respect to your question about the influence
of the Church with the campesinos in other parts of the
community; I think that it's probably true all over
Latin America that the Church has great influence on the
thinking of the population. It's interesting to note
that in San Salvador and Mexico the real church goers
are the women and not the wen, but the ren are very certain
that their wives go to church so that they're their
surrogates and that they take their children along with
them. Although they are not great church goers, I think
they are Catholics and are greatly influenced by the priests.

You asked whether the people in Ei Salvador are
oware that there have been food shortages in Cuba and that
the Castro program is undergoing serious difficulties and
the answer to that is "yes". As a matter of fact I was.
interested in this when I talked to various people, including
cab drivers and boys that shine your shoes, people working
in the markets, and some of the campesinos. There is an
awareness, certainly in the city, that Castro is having his
difficulties. One of the things that is interesting and,
of course, I think this may be referable to their Church
influence, is that the word Communism per se still has a
serious effect on people. I think it's one of the things
they talk about--social reform, etc., etc., but, the tag
Communisa is still a very harsh tag in the Latin American
mind. I think this is one of the serious errors Castre
made from his point of view was to declare himself a
Communist and a Marxist-Lenninist because many people that
might have gone along with him at that moment got frightened
off. There is an awareness that he is having troubles and
that the Revolution hasn't gone along on the way it has.
Also there was a lot of talk among a certain group of
people that I talked with-these were some workers from a
textile mill, that there had been an awful lot of killing
that was done by Castro. Apparently, there had been
pictures of a lot of executions in some of the Latin American.
newspapers; and this has had an effect on them.

With respect to the government prosecuting anyone for
violation of the minimum wage law: As far as I understand,
it's still in its infancy. I think the belief of the
government is that if they start to impose any violations
this might have a serious effect in getting the program
across. But in this respect, I'd like to mention the
seventh day wage that was passed about a year ago when I


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

was in Salvador apparently is working fairly well. You'll recall that this was accepting with the Bible that if anyone worked for six days (this was referable to the campesinos) he was entitled to the seventh day pay. I was worried at the time and mentioned my worries to Choretic (Phonetic) and also the Minister of Economics who was at breakfast with us at that time, that one of the possible dangers of any reform is that it is not carried through intelligently and forcibly. It is better not to have a reform, not to announce a now idea, not to arouse expectations, if there is going to be violation of those expectations. At that time it was contemplated that the army would administer the program of the seventh day pay. Apparently they have changed their mind on that and have a civilian group that is administering the program; there has been nc real scandal with respect to violations of this. I was a little fearful that a local army guy would get paid off by some of the big plantation owners and thus be permitted to do all kinds of violations. Apparently this has not happened, and they've been pretty effective in the administration.

My big objection at that time was that again the minimum salary thing was not properly publicized. They could have had all kinds of radie and television programs, interviews with the campesinos, and asked them what they felt about this and actually doing that kind of public relations job which they did not do. I think this is true with all these reforms. I think that they have got to be brought to the people where you get reaction from the people as to the extent of the change, any reform has on their personal existence. This again is a matter of attitude, a matter of technique in public relations.

Well, it is certainly true that there has been a considerable amount of publicity about the Alianza para Progresso. I was not aware that it was this specific group that was pushing the program of publication. However, harking back to a previous statement, I think that there is a serious possibility that over publicizing of the Alianza will cause more trouble than we can at present anticipate. As a matter of fact some of the problems are already beginning to arise. I had a long talk with Ambassador Willians on this, and I think we both agreed that we ought to soft pedal much of the talk about the Alianza; and certainly to stay away from these enormous figures of millions of dollars. As far as the people in Latin America

T


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

- 9 -

are concerned they really think the world is going to change overnight and expect it to change overnight. When the changes aren't forthcoming, they are going to be very embittered and we may possibly create enemies we need not have had.

I have in mind talking with one man; he was a newspaper vendor and I happened to see a headline about the Alianza para Progresso, and this of course gave me an opening to talk to him about it. I said, "What is this going to mean to you?" He said, "I understand they are going to give me a new house." Someone standing close to his said, "What do you mean--they're going to give you a house," and they actually had an argument about the thing. The man selling the newspapers insisting that's what they were going to do--build him a new house, etc. The other man saying that's all propaganda, it's all demagogy; they say this all the time and nothing is going to occur. The chances are very strong that this man will not get into a house. The chances are almost equally strong that he won't even get an apartment because you cannot possibly meet the housing shortage in such a place in San Salvador, where I doubt more than 10% of the people have adequate hygienic dwellings. So here again, well at least, this newspaper vendor has gotten an enormously over bloated notion about what we're going to do. It may be that in his particular case, he is more aware of the Allanza and more aware of the million dollars because he is selling news papers and magazines and he is reading about it all the time. Here again I think is one of the dangers with respect to the publicity about the Alianza.

I think I mentioned in my report about a year ago it might be a good idea to get some experts in public relations, and that they might be recruited from such places as Mexico and Puerto Rico where you have people who have worked with either government agencies, with some of our embassies, or with some of the public relations firms such as General Rubicam & Noble Advertising and other very widely-known public relations groups in Latin America. I think it might be a good idea for the government to have someone counseling him and particularly on any wide shifts of policy on how to present it to the public. I think it would be an enormously effective way in presenting the programs of the government, and it would be a good investment they could make at this point. And I don't just mean getting the

ordinary Madison Avenue flock. : I think it ought to be a person who has had some experience dealing with the Latin American temperament because any program has to arise out of the psyche of the peopio that are being dealt with.

Incidentally, I did see some of the pictures and some of the coverage that was given Rivera during his election campaign and whoever handled that, I think, was very effective; and I've suggested to the Arbassador that he might suggest that the same people or person be retained to accompany Rivera into his position as prosident.

I think one of the key persons with respect to the left in El Salvador is the Dean of the School of Economics whose name is Jose Rodriguez Puiz. He is also the son of the president of the University. Now first a word about the young son--he gave a lecture on Marxism one of the nights I was there, and I went to the lecture. The hall was filled to capacity; there were people standing in the doorways, and I would estimate there were 400 or 500 people thore. It was a rather interesting experience because from what I heard I had been led to believe that it would be kind of a rabble rouser and that he would try to instigate the people into action. Actually what I saw was--personally It was very moving, really: He has kind of the manner of a priest. His voice tends to tremble at first, but as he got more involved, he lost the tremor in his voice and sounded more like a very intense professor. The interesting thing was when he spoke about the United States, it was more in symbolic toras; there was nothing of real harsh personal rancor either in his voico, his manner, or in what he was actually saying; but it was almost as if he were referring to an obstraction of the United States. lie didn't take off on the Ambassador personally. He just talked about American ambassadors and he was bitter, less inclined to be sarcastic then merely hitter. Be is a very effective human being. I note as I sat there, he moved the audience that he had, emotionally. I could see one of them kind of swallowing and the tears running down eyes of the girl to the left of de. There was really no attempt to rabble rouse as such, there was no attempt to get the people out in the streets as it were. Toward the end he made a very Interesting statement--he said: "We know that there are changes necessary, we know that we have got to free ourselves of the imperialist yoke of the United States, and we know that these changes have got to core through us; no one is ing to help us but ourselves," but he says in In making these


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 150

- 11 -

changes come about, let us be careful that we do not ruin and that we do not set back our program by taking precipitous action, without plan. Suddenly, it come almost as a jarring note, he said--well perhaps we're not ready to act yet, but whatever we do, we've got to do it reasonably so that we don't lose the revolution as such. I don't know whether he had eference to the fact that maybe in Cuba the revolution did not work because certainly he was very pro Castro. I think that there was a kind of note of wariness in his talk, and it is interesting.

I suggested to the ambassador that it might be a good idea for him to set up a meeting with Guillermo Moscoso with the older Jose Napoleon Rodriguez Ruiz who was the (rector) of the University, and possibly ask this younger follow, the Dean of the School of Economics to come along and try in effect to have Moscoso say, "Look, I know you probably disagree with a lot that we're doing and you are very skeptical about the Alianza para Progresso; you're very skoptical about the United States per sc. Maybe in many senses you're right, warhe in the past you had renson to feol that there has been imperialism, but we want to indicate to you that we have a change of attitude and just give us a chance and I need your counsel and you're un economist and I want to know. I realize that we may disagree, but I wanted to meet you anyway." I think that there is a pessibility that a person in his frame of mind and I say this is only a ressibility and it may be very minimal as a possibility; but there is a chance that we may be able to recreato some kind of the with him so that he is not aร bitter and as antagonistic. I do not think, at least from hearing that lecture, that evening that he is entirely boyond the pale; and bear in mind that there were no Americans, there was no one in the audience (that I could detect at least) who were not from El Salvador itself. I realize that there may be various opinions with respect to this, but I did suggest it to the ambassador. He thought it might be a good idea and he may very well do that.

Apparently the father, Jose Rodriguez Ruiz, Sr. (Napoleon), is a person who is approachable. Ho is not as far to the left as his son. He is a liberal, but he is not considered a Communist. There is, I understand, some- thing in the Embassy about him, but apparently it has been checked out and it is felt that he is not a Communist. In any event, there has been an invitation extended to him to come to the United States. I think, as a matter of fact, that with many of these poople that if they were to come to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

-12 -

the United States and given some kind of chance to observe the United States first hand, they would be less bitter about us. I think that they have adopted some very dogmatic notions about us; they believe some of what they see in the movies; kinds of snatches of newsreels about the situation in the South. Actually, they have a very distorted notion, and some of it is a very sincere distorted notion. They really believe some of the things they've heard. I think if they would see us first hand they might feel differently. Just as I think sometimes when a lot of these fellows go to Russia or Cuba; they come back disenchanted that it isn't what they have been told it is. I know that I've talked to some people in Mexico who have seen Cuba first hand during the last year and have had noticeable changes of mind as to what it is. It's one thing to hear all the good things that the leftists say about a thing, but it's another thing when you actually go there and observe some of the tyrannical atmosphere. I think the same thing is true on the reverse that you can disenchant people by sending them to Russia or to Cuba or behind the Iron Curtain. Just as sometimes you can rub away some of the malimpressions, erroneous impressions by sending people to the United States and having them live on a campus for example, such as Cambridge, Michigan, or any such place where they can see first hand that we're not the oppressors that they have been led to believe for a long time. Much of this is really lack of exposure.

During the time that I was in El Salvador about 10 days ago, there arose a serious problem of the departation of Salvadoranians from Honduras; and it was all over the news- papers, and very strong statements were issued both in the editorials and by people over the radio about chasing out some of the Salvadoranians that had been working in Honduras for a long time. Apparently there has been a rapproachment; there were meetings between the foreign ministers and I think the problem may be resolved.

It's interesting to note that El Salvador is the most heavily populated country of Central America. I think they have a population of about 120 per square mile, whereas Honduras and Nicaragua have something like 15 of 17 per square mile. Therefore, you have a very definite problem of space and overpopulation in San Salvador. The other thing is traditionally the people of San Salvador are supposed to be the hardest workers in Central America. I remember that Antonio Rivera, a very well-known attorney in San Salvador, said that the Salvadorans were referred to as the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

SECRET

- 13 -

Japanese of Central America because they're the tough workers. Also there is a considerable amount of Salvador- anian capital that is in various industries throughout Central America which is an interesting thing to me. The comparison to the Japanese seems to be very appropriate in this situation.

I think that the real focus of trouble, if there is going to be any, would be either the Labor unions or I think more particularly in the University. My feelings about Central America, generally, is that your revolutions do not come from the campesinos or they do not even come from the lower classes. They generally are the middle- class groups or the low-middle-class groups. I think in- Havana, for example, Batista was overthrown, not by the campesinos but by the middle classes; and then the campesinos came in afterwards because there was very little doing outside of llavana even in the Sierra Madres, there was only Castro with a small group of people. When Batista really fell is when he had so dann auch trouble inside of Havara. He fled and left because he was having problems of sabotage in ilavana itself and not because Castro was seriously threatening him from the Sierra Madres, for he had actually withdrawn about a month before, if you recall.

I think with respect to the situation in Santo Domingo, here again Union Civica Nacional was made up by the intel- lectuals and by the middle classes and not by the campesinos. As a matter of fact, Trujillo has tremendous support and adulation among many of the campesinos and his real basic political strength was from the low economic groups. As a matter of fact the Secret Police was recruited from the lower barrios where he had the toughest little juvenile delinquents you could imagine as a Secret Police, and this was a real force. The interesting thing is that right after Trujillo died, the first big mass meeting that his son had was in the poorest barrio in Santo Domingo because he knew that's where Trujillo still had basic strength..

I think the same thing is true in San Salvador. I don't think it will be the campesinos that will give you the trouble; it will be the students. With respect to the student situation, I think they might borrow leaf from PRI'S book in dealing with the students. I think the government cught to make a very strong attempt to fors a liaison with the universitites and whenever they get some apt pupils to give them a job in the government, to bring them into the various positions within the government and the same thing with professors, to have them as economic advisors


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 153

- 14 -

whenever they can. They're human beings--one, they'11 be flattered and another thing, they'll need the money. I think one of the things that might be helpful with respect to the situation in the universities is to try and catch some of these students in the high school level. I suggested to the ambassador, a plan that would be something comparable to the Rotary Club's scholarships that are given in Colorado. I remember that when I was going through high school, I was given $10 a month by the Rotary Club and I was given a sponsor. I used to meet him once a month and we'd have lunch. I remember this very strongly because it was meaningful to me to have this kind of relationship. I think thet many of the businessmen in San Salvador could get the bright young guys in the high schools who are actually the guys who become the effective leaders in the college. Get then on the high school level and become friends with then. Once they have gotten to know some of the people who are supposed to be the ogres that they later talk about, and have had some actual financial help from ther; they are more apt to be approachable. At least the person who has been their sponsor during the time in high school can approach them. I think we have got to start working on this at a stage before they get to the university. Your leaders can be spotted, the people who are going to be your most effective in colleges can be spotted in the high schools. I think that is the time to start bringing sose of the people in close contact with the government, also the business community. I talked to the ambassador about this and he said he felt it was a good idea and was going to talk to some of the people about it. I think, dearing in mind, that the universities are really power seats in many of the Latin American countries. We have got them to accept this as a starting point and then work with this and find out what are the elements that produce the Icaders and when do the leaders first become observable and try to catch them at the earliest possible time. I think it would ameliorate much of the situation with respect to the students. The other thing (still on the university thing) I've observed in places that I have been is that the newspapers in these universities really are not newspapers. I think the leftist newspapers are really truly ineffective as far as appealing to the middle span. The same thing with the rightist, you have either the right or the left. The Catholics, generally speaking, have newspapers that are more costly; and they are very dogmatic to the right. Then you have the leftist students who have poorly printed or poorly mimeographed newspapers to the left. Isuspect that the vast number of students who are in the middle never have any newspapers and here,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

I think, is a fertile field for west free the acl. I saw a newspaper in Il Salvador called the Daily News; it's an American newspaper. I don't know who is the editor of it, but it is really truly a newspaper and it's a good job. It is well edited; it is a newsy periodical and I think it could be used as a format for many of the newspapers in some of these Central American universities. In Mexico I think you would have to have a printed newspaper because there are more resources, but a lot can be done with mimeographed newspapers if they are made into newspapers. My suggestion would be that you have actual news, gossip columns in these newspapers about who is going with whom and all that sort of stuff, have student programs, have actual news about lectures that are given; and make it about two-thirds news and about only one-third editorial. Once you get people in as readers then they will read some of your editorial comment. Also it can become the organ to the middle because none of the middle groups in any of the universities I have ever seen have a newspaper that speuks for them. I think, for example, and I mentioned this to Dave Phillips and Bill Carlson in Mexico, that there isn't an effective student newspaper at the University of Mexico. This is a place where you have 83,000 students and this is the growing middle class, these are the spokesmen. They don't have a newspaper, and I think it might be a good idea, for example, to have some kind of symposium in El Salvador where you invite prospective editors of student newspapers to study the techniques of typography; to study the techniques of what makes a newspaper readable. Actually La quincena that is published in Mexico, for example, is obviously a political tract. There isn't one single article that appears that doesn't have a political pitch, a very strong anti-leftist pitch. Frankly, it is a boring newspaper and typographically it looks very presentable; it's an expensive project. Interesting enough in the third issue of it they had a big editorial page saying we are not supported by the American Embassy. We have gathered our own funds, etc. Weil, "We thinkest thou protesteth too loudly," is certainly true in that situation. As I understand it we are not really sponsoring the newspaper, but it has the look of it. None of these newspapers have any ads or anything of this nature. I think that when you don't have any ads or you don't have any (parental where withall) it is alsays suspected of being a poid-for newspaper. I think even in these little sizeograph sheets we could always find people who would give a nominal sum, say even a dollar a month, for just


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 155

- 16 -

an ad just so you could use an ad advertising their book
store or ury goods store to give it the appearance of a
newspaper that is making its own go and it is not just a
paid-for propaganda plece. I think there is a great
need for these kinds of newspapers in all of these univer-
sitles. I would be tickled to death as a matter of
fact, for I have a special interest in this thing, to
give whatever help I can. I know that the Ambassador.
in Salvador is very interested in this. ile is a former
newspaper editor. ile edited the student newspaper and
of course it hit him immediately as a good idea. I
edited a student newspaper and perhaps that is why I am
especially aware of this kind of thing, but I think we've
rissed the boat many years in this. I think even if we
have to edit the newspaper ourselves, these organs should
be in the universities.

CONTACT REPORT

Date 5 June 1962

MEMORANDUM: of Contact and Conversation

SUBJECT: Henry Lopes

1. Messer's Dick Cuderkirk and Forter Qoss contacted Subject at the Shoreham Hotel in room 506 N on 5 June to debrief him on his current travel in El Salvador. Subject will be in Washington until Thursday, 7 June. At the Subject's request a further briefing will take place Wednesday, 6 June at 0930 hours with the benefit of a tape recorder. Subject believed that there was sufficient material to warrant a detailed question and answer type discussion and stated that he preferred this form reporting.

2. During the course of luncheon, at which the majority of the meeting was conducted, the following items of interest were brought out in conversation. Most topics were discussed in generalities in view of the arranged formal briefing scheduled for the following morning with a recorder.

a) Subject feels that there is a chance for real stability in the Rivera government with the proper support from the US Government.

b) Subject stated that a slight disparity existed in the direction being taken between the State Dept (Ambassador) on the one hand and the COS on the other. Specifically, Subject believed that COS was supporting elements too far to the right.

c) The military is apparently a true "third force" and not aligned with the 14 families, but broken up into conservative senior officers and an emerging more liberal junior officer corps. Subject believed that there may be a possibility of getting to the campesinos through the liberal element of the military, but not tog the 14. families.

d) 14 families are becoming isolated and have neither the full support of the church, the military, or the government. The attitude toward the minimum wage rate of the Rivera government seems to be "pay one half as many twice as much.". The cooperation of the 14 families is needed for the econont

Ref: 253 203


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 160

development of the country, but as of now they are all the way Right. As for the minimum wage concept, the campesinos apparently do not grasp it s meaning.

e) The church is not so far Right that it supports the 14 families and it is tending more towards the relative left.

f) The Alliance for Progress has been badly handled, as have some of the activities of the Peace Corps. Subject believes that too much has been promised through propaganda already without corresponding results. He believes the danger of the program falling into ridicule is great if the US continue to promise only, or continues its badly managed publicity *play program*.

g) Discussion of the student University papers yielded Subject's opinion that they are largely ineffective because they deal in polemics rather than fact and news items, and because the ones with too good format are obviously US puppets.

h) Less conversation about Fidel Castro is evident in public, although the Fidel movement is still to be reckoned with. Recently there has been a resurgence *stimulated by the Right* of the Martinez dictator of the 1,0's - good old days when everybody had a job- *this sentiment was even expressed by some campesinos*.

3. Subject mentioned that he had both high and low level contacts in El Salvador and had managed to get a reading of public opinion and private belief. Apparently it is a mistake for Rivera to delay the inauguration so long after the election, at which time a favorable image of the Col was successfully kept before the public, but which is now wearing off.

4. Subject proposed the following courses of action in certain fields that were discussed in more depth.

c) Radio is the best means of communication with the campesinos. Subject was impressed with the results of the operation run by the Catholic priest in Bolivia using pre-beamed radios. He considers that a similar operation


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 161

would be extremely valuable if properly handled.

b) Recommends that the 15 families be approached on a millionaire to
millionaire basis in cooperate with a reasonable reformist movement. Also that they be approached by the Guick thru the women.

c) That the son of Rodriguez *Luig* son is head of the Economics.

dent at the University- be approached by Moscose and himself and asked
to cooperate for at least a year's trial basis. The son is a very moving
orator, but Marxist oriented, and skeptical about the success of the
Alliance , *but not an inflammatory type - would tea fair contestant in any issue.*

d) That an effective student, youth newspaper be developed which
is a newspaper and not a propaganda sheet, which appeals to the student
body.

e) That he use his newly formed contact the Minister of Public
*Nottenius*
Works- Julio *A* - to get an introduction to Rivera when he is
in Washington. Subject plans to develop his relationship with *Julho*.
Subject Claims a very intimate relationship with *Julho* &
is positive that *Julio* would party include him in gatherings while

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief, ARD DESENSITIZED

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: Qualifications of Lee C. RENICK for Political Operations

ACTION REQUIRED: For your information

REFERENCES: HRM-10575, 11 April 1962

DATE: 10 May 1962

1.  The Station had been aware of RENICK's association with Congressman Kingo. Quite frankly, however, the Station was not *aware* of the extent to which RENICK engaged in political election activities until receipt of Reference and a discussion with RENICK. Headquarters is correct in considering him qualified for political action operations involving elections.

2.  Perhaps Station Mexico's comments were colored by the desire not to lose ELICK's services even temporarily. His cover occupation as a professor at the National University makes it difficult for him to leave classes for FI assignments. He is also handling two Station operations. One of these, LORCA, involves meetings with his Station officer at least three times a week. In some circumstances, such as the present student strike situation, KOLICE and the Station case officer meet almost daily.

3.  Also pertinent is the fact that Howard G. VICKERY has had qualifications in the election field which are certainly superior to RENICK's. (See HR-00417 for Headquarters evaluations). Furthermore, Station Mexico has understated that VICKERY's assignment in Mexico was based on the presumption that he would be on hand for just such assignments. Although Station Mexico is using TICKORY, it has constantly borne in mind that he may be called on to travel at any moment, as he is doing this date in San Salvador. Finally, the Station feels strongly that VICKERY as a permanent duty, is better suited to such assignments.

4.  In summary, RENICK will be available for any assignment in any area requested by Headquarters. At the same time, Station Mexico will appreciate Headquarters consideration of VICKERY for such assignments, for the reasons stated above.

1.  In February or March 1961 Subject, a contract agent (Identity under separate cover) presently based in Mexico, was sent on TEI to El Salvador to make a private evaluation of general social, economic and political conditions in that country.

INFO: Chief, Africa Division

FROM: Chief of Station, Leopoldville

SUBJECT: WITHRUSH/Antonio SOTO Y VASQUES and Cecelio Juan PADRON SANCHEZ

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES: For your information and such action with ODURGE as you deem appropriate.

1. Attached is a self-explanatory Memorandum for Record concerning the above captioned individuals.

2. On 15 December, Ernesto Despaigne, the administrative officer, confronted these men with the information in the attached memorandum. Both men admitted that they forged the passports themselves for the purpose of obtaining a visitare visa to Spain. They also claim that an unidentified friend in Miami sent these passports to them.

3. Both men have been told that their action in forging these passports was a very serious matter, particularly so since they are not yet PBPRIME citizens. Sufficeth to say both were shaken considerably over the prospect that we might make the attached information available to ODURGE.

4. To the extent possible, JMWAVE is requested to inform future contractees that if they commit such acts while on duty in the Congo they will be relieved of their jobs.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Antonio SOTO Y VASQUES 201-294544

Cecelio Juan PADRON SANCHEZ 201-287481

1. On the afternoon of 14 December, Colonel Touart, Defense Attache,
   called me to say that the Spanish Embassy Charge, Varella, had called him
   about SOTO and PADRON who were pilots for F.A.C. and who were
   applying for visas to Spain. VARELLA questioned the validity of their
   passports which were Cuban, and which, according to VARELLA, were
   renewed 7 June 1965 for SOTO and 26 August 1965 for PADRON. The renewal
   stamp they were renewed in Havana, Cuba. TOUART asked me about
   this and told him I knew nothing about it and whether the Spanish Embassy
   gave them visas or not was of no concern to me.

2. On 14 December TOUART came back to see me saying he had seen both
   passports because VARELLA had been over to see him about the matter.
   TOUART said that VARELLA was perturbed about these two and remarked
   a number of times about the incompetence of KUBARK to permit men in
   their employ to have such phony documents (NOTE: I also gather that
   TOUART was a little gleeful also at what he thought was poor handling of
   personnel on our part.) TOUART asked what he should do. I told him not
   to do anything and deny any knowledge of these men. Also, if VARELLA
   did not want to issue a visa to these men, we could care less. TOUART,
   I gather, imagines himself as the great go-between to help out his Spanish
   brethren. I told TOUART I would look into the matter from our new interests
   but that was none of VARELLA's business, and the less we become involved
   the better.

3. TOUART said that VARELLA brought the passports over to him this
   morning and he copied the following information from the passports:

Antonio SOTO Y VASQUES, Cuban passport number 38126, dated
17 June 1965 at Havana, Cuba.

SOTO U.S. address: 379 E. 64th Street, Hialeah, Florida.
Also has U.S. Immigration Form I-512 dated May 26, 1965.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 7

SUBJECT: Antonio SOTO Y VASQUES - Cecelio Juan PADRON SANCHEZ

Cecelio Juan PADRON SANCHEZ - Cuban passport number 46128
issued at Havana, Cuba - 26 August 1965.

U.S. address: 2040 N. W. Flagler Avenue. Apt. 4. Miami.
I-512 Form dated March 15, 1965

4. A review of the records of these men revealed the following:

a. SOTO - Arrived Leopoldville from Miami on 31 May 1965. If above information correct, SOTO obtained a Cuban passport *after* his arrival here because the alleged date of his passport is 7 June 1965, one week after his arrival in Leopoldville.

b. PADRON - Arrived Leopoldville 17 March via Pan Am. His Cuban passport, according to TOUART, was dated 26 August 1965, five months after his arrival here.

5. I will investigate through Ernesto DESPAIGNE because it may be that they have purchased passports after arrival here.

Date: 22 JUN 1955

TO : Chief, KUCURL

FROM : Chief, IUPACAN

SUBJECT : WITHRUSH Helicopter Training and Familiarization in 47G3B1

1. The two PBRUMEN pilot trainees arrived in Iden A on 4 May 1965. Helicopter training started on 6 May and terminated 15 May. Iden B arrived at the training area 9 May to receive briefings and familiarization in all aspects WITHRUSH helicopter project. Iden B departed 12 May 1965.

2. The surrounding area of Iden A and Iden C was utilized as the training site with most of the training taking place a few miles south of Iden C. The local cover story was that IUPACAN was training pilots with view of using them to ferry helicopters to northwestern PEPRIME, where they would be utilized by IUPCAK. Cover story was backstopped through Iden D and Iden E (cleared and KUBARK witting). There were no security problems encountered during the training period. Some of the precautions taken were use of alias identification, first name basis for everyone, payment by cash, luggage tags and tickets secured, and close but subtle supervision of the students by the case officer.

3. Following is a resume of helicopter training and familiarization received by each student. Included are instructor pilot and case officer evaluations:

IDEN F

a. Iden F received training in all normal helicopter maneuvers, pre-flight, post-flight and cockpit procedures. Additional training was as follows:

1) Radio procedures with UHF, VHF, HF and LF ADF.
2) Dead reckoning and cross-country 4+10 hours.
3) Personnel rappelling, personnel parachuting and use of cargo slings-2+00 hours.
4) Ground school:

b) Navigation and flight planning.
c) Weight and balance.
d) General oral questioning and orientation 9+00.
5) Supplemental reading.
6) Flying time:
Dual 21+55
Solo 2+30
Student Dual 1+50
TOTAL 26+15 Hours

b. Prior to his arrival at the training site Iden F received 12+20 hours of dual flying instruction on pre-flight maneuvers and emergency procedures, which included 4 hours of autorotation.

c. The language barrier between student and instructor retarded the student's progress to some extent. His navigation, flight plan- ning and weight and balance work is limited. It is recommended that he have access to a helicopter each day in order to buildup his time.

d. The student was willing, cooperative and intelligent.

IDEN G

a. Iden G's training schedule included much of the same material as that of Iden F except that his personnel rappelling, parachuting and sling work amounted to 1+35 hours. His cross-country time a- mounted to approximately 1+50 hours.

1) Flight time:
   Dual 10+10

a. Iden B received training which exposed him to all aspects of Bell 4763B1 helicopter flight and support requirements.

b. The flight familiarization included almost all of the normal helicopter maneuvers along with radio procedures. His total flight time amounted to 5+30 hours. Both instructor pilots noted that his flying procedures were rough, but were improving steadily. He did not solo inasmuch as both pilots indicated that he was not ready for solo..

c. Iden B wash given approximately 9 hours orientation in helicopter maintenance and from 3-4 hours of orientation with regard to the contents of the support kits and accessory equipment.

d. Complete assessment of this individual is difficult to make, as he was only in the training area for a short period of time. However, the following information may be helpful in making an evaluation:

1) Flying proficiency in 476381 is below par at this time. He requires more dual and emergency procedures.

2) His conversation and experience indicates that he is more knowledgeable of Hughes equipment than he is of Bell equipment.

3) Iden B appears to be a very extroverted type of individual. In any conversation he does most of the talking.

4) The instructor pilots felt that his knowledge of helicopters leaned to the "manual" side rather than the practical side. He seemed, according to the instructor pilot, to have a "shallow" knowledge of helicopter operations.

5. The case officer for the WITHRUSH pilot training was Alfred F.. PELANDER. Instructor pilots were Iden H and Alexander V. DECLIPPLE.

Date: 22 JUN 1965

TO : Chief, KUCURL
FROM : Chief, IUPAGAN
SUBJECT : Helicopter Flight Training for WITHRUSII

1. Objectives:

The primary purposes of this program was to prepare two WITHRIJSH employees (Iden A and Iden B) to operate a 47G3B1 Bell Helicopter under simulated tactical situations involving rescue and reconnaissance operations. Secondarily, Idens A and B were to be familiarized to the fullest extent with the operational capability of the helicopter and its accessory equipment. Iden A did not prove adaptable to this type of aircraft and failed to complete transition training. Iden B complete transition training. Iden B completed the prescribed training, evidencing consistent performance progress as well as alertness, independence and a cooperative attitude.

2. Period of Training:

Training commenced for Iden A on 15 March and for Iden B on 27 March. Iden B's training was satisfactorily completed on 15 April. A total of 50 ½ hours of training time was logged during the entire course of instruction.

3. Instructors:

The training instructors utilized were Alexander. V. DECLIPPEL and Iden C. TUPAGAN PDO's provided training as to cargo sling operation, rappelling and operational capabilities of special equipment.

4. Training Areas Utilized:

Training was conducted entirely within Iden D utilizing suitable terrain in the vicinity of Idens E, F, G, and H. Airports and motel accommodations in or adjacent to these localities were used.

5. Security:

APA-0100

Sound operational security piactices were employed in the handling of Idens A and B as to relationship with the general public. It was not necessary for either the instructors or the students to refer to IU...FLAG in dealings with the general püblic. A logical cover of training for IUPEAK operations sufficed to handle any local inquiries concerning reasons for the aircraft's being in the vicinity or the purposes of the training. No known breaches of securyty as to identity of personnel or the true purposes of the training occurred.

6. Training Program:

The following training agenda was covered during the period of Iden B's instruction:

Helicopter Training Program:

a. Cockpit procedures
b. Review of supplemental reading, instruction manuals, ete.
c. Warmup and shutdown procedures
d. Pre-flight procedures
e. Basic pre-solo maneuvers:

1) High and low reconnaissance
2) Approach to confined areas
3) Pinnacle operations
4) High altitude landings, hoverings, etc.
5) Slope operations
6) Low-level cross-country
7) Navigation
8) Emergency procedures (very limited)
9) Use of cargo nets, litters, cargo racks
10) Personnel rappelling
11) Personnel parachute jumping
12) Limited and restricted solo

7. Critique:

a. The training program should be formalized to a greater degree. A syllabus of items to be covered has been prepared and reviewed by Alevander V. DECIPPEL. A copy of this syllabus is attached and it is felt will assist in providing a guide to the instructor and permit a more orderly procedure and better utilization of time epended. It can be adapted easily as a statistical report covering training.

b. The training areas utilized from a standpoint of terrain, climate and accessibility for maintenance proved acceptable.

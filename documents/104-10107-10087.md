MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. I showed Mr. George Carey his memorandum of 1955 to the Director referring to T. and H., and said we thought that H. referred to a General Hardin. After considerable speculation Mr. Carey finally placed T. as being Juan Trippe and Hardin as an Air Force General who was being placed with
   24(Pan Am) for operational reasons, primarily technical information collection. Independently Mrs. Lovejoy had checked with Mr. Larocque, and he also recalled General Hardin was a man
   Mr. Carey was interested in placing with(Pan Am) for operational reasons.

24

2. The Air Force Register lists a General Thomas O. Hardin, Air Force Major General, who retired in 1955, which would seem to fit in as he is listed as an airline executive. Mr. Carey had no knowledge whatsoever of the Itkin case, and we felt it was out of the question that General Hardin is synonymous with Philip Harbin.

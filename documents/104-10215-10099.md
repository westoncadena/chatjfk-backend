(1) Cutout services, as suggested by headquarters, in an effort to test Subject's abilities.

(2) As a basic and continuing assignment to permit and encourage development of Subject's best local contacts as well as in the hope of filling a long-felt need in our operational pattern, he will be assigned to the general topic of labor; specifically, communist penetration of local non-communist labor groups and theoretical developments which are of interest regardless of group designation.

(3) Subject appears to be genuinely interested and to possess an unusual appreciation for operational ways and means, which is seldom encountered. For this reason, none of his assignments will be exclusive, and he will be encouraged to follow up such leads and opportunities as arise in the course of his daily occupations regardless of any objective and target assignments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 6

B. Targets

(1) Subject will commence by serving as cutout for Hurger, who has always held out great promise but never been properly developed or directed.

(2) In the labor field, the principal and only target at the moment is the only labor federation, the *Rerum Novares*.

(3) Subject will represent our only contact among the student groups and certain allied "intellectual" societies. Any activity in this category showing promise may subsequently become an assigned target.

C. Cryptonym and Essential Data on Personnel

The designation "Hydropathic", heretofore applied to subject individual, is hereby discarded. He will hereafter be designated by San Jose Station Symbol No. 26. For essential data on personnel, see TZP-A-365, Part I and II.

D. Control and Contact

Judging by Subject's background data and his already demonstrated cooperative attitude, we do not feel that control and direction of his activities will be any problem. Contact, owing to the nature of this project, will be frequent and carried out in any convenient manner, generally in one or the other of our respective homes.

E. Cover

Subject had planned to and has established himself in Costa Rica for entirely personal reasons, prior to any contact with this office. He has a Costa Rican wife, attends the university, and lives a perfectly normal life which any assignments from us will not disrupt. Our only anticipated problem is that of mutine contacts between Subject and the Chief of Station. That matter will be handled with care and discretion.

F. Cost

Subject has agreed to serve for a salary equivalent to $50.00 per month, to be paid in colones. To offset this expense we plan to dispense with the services of Hucklebone who is presently receiving $400.00 per month.

G. Timing and other Factors

Our preliminary interviews with Subject lead us to believe that he will be the interested and reliable American cutout for which this station has long felt a need. His greatest virtue in this respect appears to be an understanding of operational methods and an appreciation of relative values with respect to information. It is hoped to make this a permanent project, but our plans and our arrangements with Subject are considered to be probationary, dependent entirely upon his development and future usefulness.

DISPATCH NO. TZP-A-355 Part-H

TO: Acting Chief, FisT

DATE: November 1948

FROM: Chief of Station, Parama City, Par.ara.

SUBJECT: GENERAL. Operations.

SPECIFIC. Operational ata - ENDROFATHIC PART TI

1. The subject of TZP-A-365 Part I is HITCPATHIC.

2. Subject is best qualified to serve as a cutout in hardling informants. He has had experience along these lines in cultivating and collecting information from the following individuals:

Government Oppositionists:

Lr. José PEZLT

Lic. Angel V Lences

Eng. Luis AD CENZ

Prof. Luis

Government Supporters:

Lic. Demetrio ARTEL

Lic. Alberto ANSALLO

Lic. Generoso SILCS

As a result of the recent meeting between Elner C. LERCER and Grover J. PIKO, Subject has been recruited for the specific task of acting as a cutout in handling HYDECOYST I, who can be handled more profitably if trasferred to the control of CP's station. Subject to Home Office approval, no definite commitments have been rade in this case.

3. Subject has a working knowledge of the following subjects:

a. Protocol

b. Liaison methods pertaining to intelligence in Latin American countries and inter-departmental liaison within our own goverment.

c. Cornurications systems. Subject transmits and receives about 12 - 16 words per minute in Lorse code.

d. The political structure of Latin American governments.

CLASSIFICATION

201-168881


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

e. Subversive potential and leading subversive personalities of most Latin American countries.

f. Subject is trained in the use of firearms, jungle warfare, and has studied and worked with maps and charts, and is acquainted with surveillance and evasion procedures.

g. His primary activity after his arrival in the new area may of itself be useful. However, it is doubtful if this man will be able to devote any large portion of his time to our work until such time as he is thoroughly oriented.

4. Subject is best qualified to procure information in Latin American countries, particularly Panama and Costa Rica.

## LAVIER OF CETATICH

5. After he has established himself, Subject is interested in traveling in Argentina, Chile and Brazil.

6. He is willing to travel for us and subject to Home Office approval, it is planned to introduce HYDROPATHIC to HYDROCYST who will, in turn, introduce HYDROPATHIC to HYDROCYST I and, if approved, to HYDROCYST II. For the sake of cover, this is to be done on the basis that HYDROCYST and HYDROPATHIC are lodge brothers. HYDROPATHIC will join that organization in order to build up the cover. (Paragraph 8, TZF-2-565 Part I).

7. The number of people that will work for Subject is undetermined. Tentatively we have in mind HYDROCYST I and HYDROCYST II and, if he recruits then, the subjects underlined in red in Paragraph 15 of TZF-A-365 Part I. It might be well to start collecting biographic data on the latter three individuals at this time.

8. Subject is employed by another agency, but that employment will be terminated in the near future.

9. Subject has been recruited on an Embassy Intelligence Officer basis. It is possible that he knows the ultimate destination of any information he may submit.

10. As presently planned, HYDROCYST and HYDROPATHIC will be acquainted with each other. The turnover could be effected without these agents meeting, but then it would be more difficult to build up the lodge cover story. It would even be possible for HYDROPATHIC to communicate with HYDROCYST since both have a knowledge of Horse Code. However, it is believed that future information from HYDROCYST I will not have its primary value in this area.

11. Subject will be briefed to communicate by letter-drop. Here again, a lodge connection might be used as this is the present system which HYDROCYST I employs in forwarding communications to HYDROCYST.

12. Subject will be briefed to report in writing and to require his sub-agents to do so wherever possible.

![Secret]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

13. Subject cannot be expected to devote any major portion of his time to our work until he has built up his cover and is oriented in his new surroundings. Although fluent in the lanmuare, he will probably encounter a good deal of new terminolog.

14. Subject has entered into a tentative oral contract to perform services for us for a salary of $50.00 per month. This can be rade into a written contract at any tire.

15. Subject's tontative continuing project is outlined in paragraph 2 above.

16. Subject should be capable of initiating his om projects.

PAYGENT

17. Starting in February 1949, it will be necessary to pay subject $50.00 11.S. dollars per ronth as indicated in paragraph 14 above.

18. Subject has been told that if his services prove satisfactory, he can expect an increase in salary. No specific amount was discussed.

19. It is contemplated that this station may be required to a certain travel expenses for Subject. If done, this will be charged against Froject Development.

20. No cost of purchase of information is involved at this time.

21. Subject's superiors regard this ran as highly dependable. He has had considerable experience in writing reports and has remarked that his two principal criticisms of intelligence reporting as he has observed it in this area is that the reporting is inclined to be sensational rather than factual and that cost people have nothing to report other than that which the opposition is willing that they receive. He should have a fair con-. concept of security. However, general security in this area is very lax and he ray have subconscious bad habits.

22. In view of his background, Subject should only be good in semi-covert work.

23. If this man is kept under cover he might eventually effect a penetration of scholastic or parlor-pink circles. It is presumed that this would be on a low level.

24. This individual could easily be recruited for a full-time job with our organi- zation. Forever, it is believed that core is to be gained by starting him off in this carner, perhaps giving hin periodic schooling and gradually in- creasing his activities and responsibilities.

# TERMINATION SECRECY OATH

I, Ross L. Crozier, am about to terminate my association with the Organization. I realize that, by virtue of my duties with the Organization, I have been the recipient of information and intelligence which concerns the present and future security of our country. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited by the espionage laws of our government which specifically requires the protection of intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR, WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS, AS FOLLOWS:

1.  I will never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct, or otherwise, any information relating to the national defense and security and particularly information of this nature relating to intelligence sources, methods, personnel, fiscal data, or security measures to anyone, including, but not limited to, any future governmental or private employer, private citizen, or government employee or official without the express written consent of the Chief of the Organization or his authorized representative.

2.  I have been invited to submit in writing any monetary claims I may have against the Organization or our government which may in any way necessitate the disclosure of information described herein. I have been advised that any such claims will receive full legal consideration. In the event, however, that I am not satisfied with the decisions of the Organization concerning any present or future claims I may submit, I will not take any other action to obtain satisfaction without prior written notice to the Organization, and then only in accordance with such legal and security advice as the Organization will promptly furnish me.

3.  I do not have any documents or materials in my possession, classified or unclassified, which are the property of, or in custodial responsibility of the Organization, having come into my possession as a result of my duties with the Organization or otherwise.

4.  During my exit processing and during my period of employment with the Organization I have been given an opportunity to report all information about the Organization, its personnel, and its operations which I consider should receive official cognizance. Hence, I am not aware of any information which it is my duty, in the national interest, to disclose to the Organization, nor am I aware of any violations or breaches of security which I have not officially reported, except as set forth on the reverse side of this sheet or on other attachments.

   my right or need to testify be established before I am required to do so.

   to by me under this oath may subject me to prosecution under the terms of these

Resume

A1:

12 July 1963

On qualifications - there just aren't any in the civilian or industrial category - The university work in Economic Sciences was real, not cover, but interrupted before I got the degree (5 years). However, I specialized in Economic Theory, which when considered that I studied in three Latin American Universities (Costa Rica, Guatemala and Cuba) does give me some qualification as a "Latin American Consultant".

The classification as "Research Analyst" is cover except for that part of which the "Latin American" background could be utilized.

Although I have had no business experience in an administrative or executive capacity, I am sure that I could qualify in that work, especially if it were in connection with Latin America or utilizing my Spanish language ability.

As you can see by the above, unfortunately there is no comercial "counterpart" for the type of work I have been doing for 15 years or more. My feeling is that we should consult the "local outplacement" man first, on the possibility that there is a local opportunity, but the opportunities in the Latin American field whill be greater.

(In acdition to the above, I might add that I have performed best in "operations" work"- which involves planning, direction.and coordination.)

ΗΜΜΑ-13726, 11 September 1959

1. The Station would appreciate any information which Headquarters can provide concerning an ETD for Harold R. NOEMAYR and his family and an ETA for NOEMAYR's replacement, NOEMAYR's tentative ETD of 1 January 1960 is only slightly more than one month away and he has visas to obtain in addition to other departure preparations.

2. NOEMAYR was instructed by the Station to proceed with the necessary correspondence with Mexican, Costa Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of PBFRIME and is applying for an Immigrant Visa. He has already received the necessary documents from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been received as yet although it should arrive shortly. As soon as the Panamanian clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMAYR will submit all papers to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for the travel of himself and his family. As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant Visa for NOEMAYR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four months of the date issued.

3. An early reply to this dispatch would be appreciated.

HUMANOID - HUMANIST

REF: TRS-633 /

DATE: MAY 251951

DECENSITIZED

1. A review of the compromise of the technical surveillance and the part played in it by HUMANIST indicates that HUMANOID may have been compromised by the former's confession. While you indicate that HUMANIST did not know HUMANOID's name, and doubt not have given it to the police, it is quite probable that someone have told them that an american other than yourself took part in the operation.

2. It would be natural for HUMANIST to attempt to minimize the extent of his confession in his report to you, and he may possibly have given the police identifying data and a description of HUMANID. Because of these factors, headquarters feels that HUMANOID should be isolated from all operations for a period of approximately six months, in order to avoid the possibility that the authorities may suspect him of taking part in intelligence activities. It is believed that this period of inactivity will protect HUMANOID and assist him in the preservation of his cover.

3. You are authorized to continue his salary for the period during which he will perform no work for you.

4. It is requested that you turn over all operations which HUMANOID is currently handling; to another agent (or agents) as soon as practicable. If you are unable to do this, you may suspend the operations in which HUMANID has been active, until such time as HUMANOID can again resume his work for us. You are also authorized to pay the agent (or agents) whose work is suspended during this period.

DISPATCH NO. HKH-A-3314

TO : Chief, WHD

FROM : Chief of Station, Habana

DATE 17 January 1957

SUBJECT { GENERAL - Administrative
SPECIFIC Arthur G. VAIVADA

Reference: HAVA 755

# SECRET
CLASSIFICATION

1. Discussions of the whole problem of VAIVADA's early TDY to Headquarters were held between the agent, the field case officer, and the Chief of Station on 13 and 14 January, as a result of which it became clear that, unless Headquarters has a compelling reason to the contrary, it would be advisable that the contemplated TDY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA's current contract year, i.e., the period of July-August 1957.

2. A number of important personal problems dispose VIAVADA to accept the delay in acquiring staff status that would accrue from such a postponement. His wife is sufficiently ill at this time from a form of nervous colitis as to recommend that she not travel now. His children would have to lose a semester of their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. Moreover as he and family have resided in tropical areas for a number of years, VAIVADA would have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed winter clothing for himself and his family which does not seem justified for a period as short as two months. Owing to several routine but time-consuming inquiries being made by the local ODACID in connection with his wife's visa application, there is no guarantee that VAIVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 1957.

3. On the operational side, in spite of the original Station request that VAIVADA's travel be expedited, advantages now of delaying his TDY outweigh the disadvantages, from the Station's point of view. Most important of these is that two promising sources currently under development by the Station, namely AMPHODARCH-6 and AMPHODARCH-10, were originally contacted by VAIVADA and he has since been the person working most closely with them. To substitute him with a relatively untrained cut-out at this point in their development is not desirable. On the basis of the original proposed timing of his trip the Station has however proceeded with firm plans to transfer handling of two other sources, AMPHODAPCH-1 and AMBI-VALENT-5, to a reliable PBPRIME cut-out. This plan can be initiated whether VAIVADA departs now or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low-level sources off VAIVADA's hands thereby freeing the latter to undertake new

development of specific student Communist and Youth targets the Station has already lined up. Both these sources have passed through an initial period of training and have fully demonstrated their reliability and ability to continue to perform effectively via a cut-out. In handling a half-dozen sources, as VAIVADA has been doing, he reached the limits of reasonable span of control and has not had the time to give to such new developmental work which is his forte and upon which it would be most desirable to have him concentrate rather than upon the mere routine handling of relatively tested sources.

4. Delaying VAIVADA's TDY as proposed herein would place VAIVADA at Headquarters at or about the end of his current contract year, where he would be immediately available for personal consultation regarding his future asserment whether or not it is decided that he return to Habana or sent to a new post. In this connection the Station wishes parenthetically to point out its definite interest in having VAIVADA reassigned to Habana for at least one additional year if possible, and to note that VAIVADA has expressed a personal desire to that effect.

5. Regardless of the decision as to timing of his travel, VAIVADA is proceeding to change his residence. He will try to obtain a suitable house possessing a telephone, something he has lacked heretofore, thereby carrying through plans previously reported to Headquarters in paragraph 6 of HAH-A-3144.

6. Therefore, unless there exist truly urgent reasons for VAIV DA'S travel to Headquarters prior to about July 1957, it is recommended that his trip be postponed until that time.

SECRET DESENSITIZED

CLASSIFICATION

TO: Chief of Station, Panama City and
San Jose
DATE: 21 December 1948

FROM: Acting Chief, Foreign Branch ?

SUBJECT: GENERAL: Operations

SPECIFIC: Project Hydropathie

REF: 7ZP-A-365, Parts I and II

1. The proposal that the Panama Station activate an agent project in conjunction with San Jose has been studied by this headquarters and elicits the following comment. It is felt that nothing can be gained from a cumbersome joint operation of this project that cannot be obtained from a simple agent project controlled exclusively by the San Jose Station. If San Jose wishes to avail itself of these two men as an independent project, that station is authorized to proceed with its preliminary planning for submission to this headquarters for final approval.

2. In the event San Jose decides to use Hydropathic, that station is directed to become more familiar with his capabilities before entering into a formal agreement re tasks and salary. His practical experience and educational background are not outstanding and the mere fact that he has had duty with the J. S. Army in an intelligence capacity in no sense automatically qualifies him for our work. It is suggested that the San Jose Station initiate its relations with Hydropathic by using him as a cutout in an endeavor to test his abilities. If his value is proved and his Costa Rican associations appear to be in a position to give him high-level intelligence information, then come to a formal agree- ment with regard to his future work in an intelligence gathering capacity. The San Jose Station is directed to give him no encouragement at this time with respect to a later full-time position with this organization.

3. In summary Hydrocyst is to sever his formal connection with Hydrocyst I and is to have no knowledge of Hydropathie with regard to the latter's work for Mercer. Details on the procedure to be followed in Hydropathie's relation with Hydrocyst I are the responsibility of the San Jose Station and are to be submitted to this headquarters for final approval before any formal commitments are made. The Panama Station is directed to forward to San Jose all the documents in its files that are considered pertinent to the development of this project.

TO: Chief of Station, Habana DATE: 16 Oct 56 15 38z

FROM: Chief, WHD

SUBJECT: GENERAL: Administrative

SPECIFIC: Arthur O. VAIVADA; Proposal to Grant Staff Status

Reference: HKII-A-2577 201-32773

Action Required: Touch Views on Proposal Contained Herein

1. Headquarters looks favorably upon referenced proposal to grant staff status
   to Arthur O. VAIVADA. It has been determined however that such status is
   virtually out of the question for subject so long as his wife remains an
   alien. It has been further determined that the wife can acquire U.S. citi-
   zinship within a span of 45 days if she so desires and is willing to come
   to the U.S. for that period of time, most of which would have to be spent
   in the Headquarters area. There are certain other basic requirements such
   as a fair knowledge of English and an ability to pass routine citizenship
   exams. None is believed to pose any problem in this case however.

2. Headquarters recognizes that the proposed travel and related expenses might
   work certain hardships on VAIVADA and his family. In order to partially
   offset these, we are prepared to bring VAIVADA to Headquarters for TDY-
   training to coincide with his wife's stay in the U.S.

3. If the foregoing proposal meets with the approval of the Station, VAIVADA,
   and the latter's wife, Headquarters should be advised as to preferable
   dates for implementation of same. We would also like to have recommendations
   re: further training of VAIVADA at Headquarters. Any objections to the
   plan, as outlined above, should likewise be communicated to Headquarters at
   an early date.

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET

TO: Chief, Task Force W

INFO:

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: GYROSE
Housing Allowance for Contract Personnel

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

1. JMWAVE has reviewed the status of contract personnel assigned to this station and has related the circumstances of their assignment to that of staff agents with respect to the application of the station housing allowance. Certain of these contract personnel are not indigenous to this area, have been transferred or assigned to JMHAVE from other areas on the same indefinite basis as staff agents, and suffer the same inconveninces and uncertainties as staff agents which were recognized in the Headquarters approved housing policy. The rationale for granting some degree of financial relief under these circumstances, in the form of a housing allowance, is considered equally applicable to these individuals. Based on JMHAVE initial survey of the status of contract personnel the station requests that Headquarters approve extension of the housing allowance to the following individuals:

HAROLD R. HOFMAYER
PHILIP D. GLAVASCO
PETER J. DIGERVENO
IRVING C. DEVUONO
HENRY J. SLOMAN
ALICE P. JENRETTE
IRVING G. CADICK

2. Upon approval JMWAVE will forward to Headquarters copies of the proposed amended contracts and will pay and administer the allowance in the same manner as is now applicable to staff agents.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Base, JMWAVE

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET

FROM: Chief, MED

SUBJECT: JMZIP ADMIN/FINANCE Transportation and Temporary Storage of HHE (Domestic PCS Move)

Ref: UFOT 910, dated 28 October 1961

1. Reimbursement for the temporary storage of effects applicable to a domestic PCS movement is authorized from the date of the employee's departure. The maximum storage period is sixty (60) days. Harold R. BOEMAIR and William D. WENNEAD were assigned PCS to JMWAVE on 20 August 1961. Therefore, the initial reimbursement date for storage of effects is 20 August 1961. Unfortunately charges prior to 20 August will have to be borne by the individuals since regulations do not permit storage of effects during periods when an employee is absent from his domestic post of assignment.

2. Paragraph two (2) of the reference requested advice regarding reimbursement for shipment of effects between domestic PCS points using the following instruments:

a. POA - Upon evidence of a proper weight certificate, reimbursement for the transportation of 543 pounds from Washington to Miami (1104 miles) is the product of the applicable commuted rate, i.e., $19.40 (999 pounds or less) multiplied by the net hundred weight transported which is 5.43, giving a total of $105.33.

b. Rental of Trailer - If a proper weight certificate was not obtained at the time the effects were hauled between domestic PCS points, three (3) estimates must be obtained as to the weight of the effects. Reimbursement will be at the commuted rate and this includes the trailer rent (receipt is submitted).

c. Employee Rents and Drives a Truck - The same formula as given in the rental of a trailer is applicable. A weight certificate (or three estimates) along with the rental receipt must be submitted. Reimbursement is at the commuted rate.

3. Interpretation of the "Commuted Rate Table" citing examples was requested in paragraph three of the references:

a. Shipment of 4,000 lbs. of HHE from Washington, D. C. to Miami (1,111 miles) - $12.00 rate is used. In this instance the mileage is more than 1100 miles (Column "A" of Table No. 3); therefore, any mileage in excess of 1100 miles up to and including 1150 miles, the rate in Column B ($12.00) is used for shipment of 4,000 lbs. and up.

b. Minimum rates-(1) Three hundred fifty pounds billed at 500 pounds: reimbursement at the applicable rate for shipment of 500 pounds is authorized. If billing is less than for 500 pounds, reimbursement is applicable thereto.

(2) Shipment of 850 pounds HHE from Rockville, Maryland, to Miami and billed for 1,000 pounds: reimbursement - since the net weight (850 lbs.) exceeds the number of pounds shown in Column B (774 lbs. - breakpoint in lbs. for 1150 miles), the applicable rate is that shown in Column D ($15.00 for 1150 miles), and the applicable rate is the minimum hundredweight of that Column (D), instead of the actual weight (850 lbs.) of the HHE transported.

(3) The 1,000 pound minimum weight allowance for shipment to or from Fishers Island, New York is for additional allowance only and does not apply to shipment of effects from Rockville, Maryland to Miami.

4. We hope that the above has helped to clarify the transportation and storage of HHE in connection with a domestic PCS movement.

SUBJECT: JMATE/ADMIN - Transportation and Temporary Storage of HHE

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required: As stated.

Reference: HR 22-11a(1)

1. Please advise for what period reimbursement is allowable in each of the following instances of temporary storage of HHE which preceded the individual's actual PCS assignments to JMWAVE on 20 August 1961:

Harold R. NOEMAYR - In anticipation of being assigned PCS to JMWAVE NOEMAYR placed his HHE in temporary storage in Alexandria, Virginia on approximately 1 July 1961 from whence they were shipped to Miami on 22 September 1961. The date of the personnel action assigning NOEMAYR PCS JMWAVE is unknown. The date of his PCS travel order is unknown.

William D. WENHEAD - In anticipation of being assigned PCS JMWAVE WENHEAD placed his HHE in transit storage in Washington, D. C. on 27 July 1961 from whence they were shipped to Miami on 24 August 1961. The date of the personnel action assigning WENHEAD PCS JMWAVE is unknown. His PCS travel order approval date is illegible.

2. Cases have arisen which are not specifically covered by regulation. Please advise what reimbursement is allowable under HR 22-11a(3)b and attachment 2 in each of the following circumstances:

A. Employee on PCS transfer from Washington, D. C. to Miami carried 543 pounds of effects in his POV. A proper weight certificate was obtained. There was no cost to employee.

B. Employee rents a trailer on which his HHE are hauled between domestic PCS points incident to his PCS transfer. Cost to employee was only for trailer rent.

3. A question has been raiced on how to interpret the rate tables in attachment 2 to HR 22-11. For example, the mileage from Washington, D. C. to Miami, Florida is 1,111 miles. In shipping 4,000 pounds of effects between these points is the employce entitled to reimbursement at the rate of $11.70 or $12.00 per hundred weight? In addition, reimbursements where minimum weight allowances coour are not olear. De assume that in the case where 350 pounds is billed as 500 the employee is entitled to payment for 50 hundredweight at the applicable rate. However, in the case of a shipment from Rookville, Karyland to Miami where 850 pounds shipped is billed as 1,000 pounds what reimbursement is in order? HR 22-11, attachment 2, mentions a 1,000 pound minimum only in regard to Fishers Island, New York.

4. Your early reply will be appreciated.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Base, JMHFE

FROM: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: CROZIER, Ross (Premium Pay)

ACTION REQUIRED/REFERENCE: REF WATE 4698 (IN 4338) dated 21 March 1961.

1. The contract of Ross Crozier with amendments has been reviewed. It is noted that the terms set forth a rate of CS-12 as full compensation and no provision is indicated permitting additional pay. Overtime does not apply above GS-10 and premium pay has not to date been applied to contract types.

2. The approval of premium pay is based on CSC Regulations, Section 25.261 which permits such pay to full-time employees subjected to substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled overtime, night and holiday duty. Consequently certifications were received from supervisors at Headquarters attesting to those eligible and in the field all staffers were processed for this in GS-11 and above (not to exceed the top of a GS-15) on the knowledge of the various assignments subjecting our employees to these qualified conditions.

3. Since processing is an administrative exercise of effecting a personnel action to add to his salary and thereafter assure that he is taken off this entitlement as soon as he is no longer entitled to it, it is not intended to do this for short periods. Except in the initial cases effective 1 February 1961, this pay becomes effective the beginning of the first pay period after he enters this type duty and is taken off the end of the pay period when he is no longer subjected to such duty. On contract types, it is suggested, therefore, that overall aspects be considered such as:

a. Is his duty and salary similar to a staffer receiving this entitlement?

b. Is the period of time proposed for the duty 30 days or longer?

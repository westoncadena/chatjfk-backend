# Select Committee on Assassinations

## U.S. House of Representatives

3369 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

December 21, 1978

Hohorable Frank Thompson, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on House Administration
U.S.House of Representatives
Washington,. C.

Dear Mr. Chaman:

One of the Committee's employees, Eileen G. Dinneen, used her annual and sick leave in July, 1978 for maternity reasons.

Upon her return to work on August 1, 1978, she elected to work 25% of her time at 25% of her previous salary.

On September 1, 1978, the amount was raised in both instances to 50%. And then on December 1, 1978, she returned to full-time status to assist the Committee on the final report.

While the action on December 1, 1978 was duly approved, through some error the Committee's budget officer was not informed. Consequently, no payroll authorization form was processed to increase her salary.

I am now enclosing a payroll aothorization form to correct this error by increasing her calary to the proper amount of $16,100.00.

I would appreciate your approving this new authorization so that Mrs. Dinneen will receive the additional amount due her in the December, 1978 supplemental pplemental payroll.

Cordially,

LOUIS STOKES
Chairman

1. The following was prepared by

2. The information below was acquired through interrogation of CC-4276, Mario Enrique Eugenio MARTINEZ Delgado, M.D., a Cuban refugee and former resident of Havana City who left Cuba on 22 December 1969. Subsource is a medical doctor who was employed at Havana Psychiatric Hospital (Mazorra) from 1959 to December 1969.

a. /Dr/Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE O'Leary (201-022396), Psychiatrist, studied medicine at Havana University in the same class as subsource's father-in-law, Dr. Enrique CASUSO Casuso, M.D., employed as an orthopedic surgeon at the Havana Psychiatric Hospital. According to subsource's father-in-law, Subject was very active politically during his university studies; he belonged to the Student Left Wing (Ala Izquierda Estudiantil) at Havana University, which organization followed PSP directives. When Subject had completed his medical studies, he directed his political activities at the National Medical College and controlled the College for several years prior to 1959, during which years he was able to select the presidents of the College.

b. Subject is President or Director of the Neurophysiology institute (formerly Higher Nervous Activity Institute), Academy of Sciences: subsource thinks that Subject is also Professor of Medical Psychology at Havana University. Subject is a very well trained psychiatrist and has always enjoyed great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always been reputed to have very low morals, and in medical circles is "famous" as a woman chaser. He is widely reputed to attempt to seduce his female patients and his colleagues' wives. Major Bernabe ORDAZ, Director of Havana Psychiatric Hospital, considers Subject to be a vulgar political schemer utterly lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new" Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers that Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice for his own personal benefit.

c. When Castro took power, Subject surprisingly abandoned the Immediate Action medical doctors' party and joined the recently organized Revolutionary Medical Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960. In medical circles, Subject is reputed to collaborate with the DSE in brain-washing activities, but subsource had never seen any direct indications of such collaboration.

d. /Dr/ Armando *DE CORDOVA, Psychiatrist*, employed as a professor at Havana University, is a good psychiatrist about 70 years old who has always been a leftist but is not the type of immoral person that Bustamante is. De Cordoba and Bustamante travel together to almost all the psychiatric congresses held abroad; according to Major Bernabe Ordaz, the two of them would like to take over the Havana Psychiatric Hospital, and base their desire on the fact that Ordaz is not a psychiatrist. In subsource's opinion, they will never be successful in replacing Ordaz, because Ordaz enjoys the backing of both Fidel Castro and Celia Sanchez, who are good friends of his.

e. Subsource has known a Dr. Edmundo GUTIERREZ Agramonte, Psychiatrist, since 1959; Gutierrez is Director of the magazine of Havana Psychiatric Hospital and attends psychiatric congresses held abroad. He is a competent psychiatrist and has an office located on Calle 23, corner of Calle 18, Vedado, Havana City. In subsource's opinion, he is antiregime although he speaks in favor of the regime when with proregime persons, and against the regime when with antiregime persons. He does not belong to the PCC cell at the hospital and is not a militiaman. In an assembly held at the hospital in 1969 with the express purpose of increasing the number of members of the PCC cell, no one proposed Gutierrez as a possible aspirant. Gutierrez is about 50 years old and was married about February 1969.

f. Dr MI GNAGARAY, whose first name subsource thinks is Ruben, worked at Havana Psychiatric Hospital (formerly Mazorra) prior to 1959. He is proregime but not an extremist, and does not appear to be "willing to die for the regime". Mignagaray was proposed as an aspirant to the PCC cell at the llospital, in an assembly held in 1969, but stated that he had a defect consisting in the fact that he was in love. Subsource did not know whether he was accepted as an aspirant. In mid-December 1969, Dr. Cristino Cabello, employed as a psychiatrist at Havana Psychiatric Hospital, told subsource that Mignagaray had told him that he (Cabello) would have to take over Mignigaray's ward because he was going abroad to attend a psychiatric congress; subsource could give no further information on the congress or Mignagaray's date of departure. Mignagaray is described as a light-skinned mulatto, about 5'9" tall, weight about 160 pounds, 60-65 years old, brown eyes, greying hair, married; subsource thought he had three children.

g. Dr. Lino Bernabe FERNANDEZ Martinez, Psychiatrist, joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionary forces in the Escambray mountains a few months before the Playa Giron invasion; he was arrested shortly before said invasion and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Subsource had met him when both were students at Belen High School; their friendship continued at Havana University, when both were members of the Havana University Catholic Group, and later as members of the Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR). Subsource took leave of Fernandez the day that the latter joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionaries, and never saw him again. When subsource visited his brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso, held first on the Isle of Pines, then at La Cabana and later at the Guanajay Jail, he habitually asked for news of Dr. Fernandez; the information he received made him believe that Fernandez is one of the most respected prisoners because of his bravery and equilibrium. Fernandez was mentioned as an example of integrity. Other prisoners such as Dr. Andres CAO , Juan BUSTAMANTE and Antonio GARCIA told subsource that Fernandez' attitude had not varied. Fernandez' wife, Emilia LUZARRAGA , who frequently visited subsource professionally (subsource was her psychiatrist), also told subsource that Fernandez' attitude was firmly antiregime: 'Luzarraga is also antiregime.

h. Vicky ANDRIAL , a friend of Emilia Luzarraga's who sometimes accompanied her on her visits to subsource, is married to Dr. Armando Z ALD Pita, M.D., aka "Manduco", who is incarcerated at the Guanajay Jail. Subsource thought that he had been in jail since before the Playa Giron invasion; he had belonged to both the Havana University Catholic Group and the MRR. Subsource's brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso, and Vicky Andrial both told subsource that Dr. Zaldivar continued to be unyielding in his antiregime attitude.

1. Vicky Andrial lives in Miramar, Havana, with Iliana ARANGO, the wife of Rino PUIG, imprisoned at La Cabana since 1961; subsource did not know the length of Puig's sentence but did know that he had refused to accept "rehabilitation". Andrial works at the Canadian Embassy in Havana. Arango also works at an embassy in Havana, but subsource did not know which. Both Andrial and Arango are anti-regime and teach the catechism to children at Reina Church, Havana City.

3. Further questions on members of MARTINEZ' wife's family, per References B and C, are being asked and answers will be forwarded when available.

Cuban Doctor Possibly Involved with Ransom Cases

For your information and possible investigation,
deliofing of Jose Francisco BOTET Carrion, DPOB: 14 April 1936, Havana, Cuba, engineering technician who arrived as a refugee in Spain on 30 January 1970, produced the following story:

During the first two weeks of January 1970, Source's father, Jose F. BOTET who still is in Quba told him that he had met in Havana a Dr. MOLINA who was a physician who has been residing in Chicago, Illinois for the past 20 years. MOLINA told Source's father that he had come to Cuba to see the psychiatrist DUSTAMANTE (Jose BUSTAMANTE O'Leary, 201-022396 ?) who Havana rumors said has been involved in helping, homo wily or other, Cuban political prisoners in LA CADANA, BOTET's father recalled that MOLINA had a brother who was just finishing a prison term (he supposed for counterrevolutionary activities) and fuossed that MOLINA's visit was related to this fact. MOLINA would not confirm this, nor did he reveal what means the used to enter Cuba. At the time of Source's departure, 29 April 1970, MOLINA was still in Havana. Unfortunately, Source could not recall MOLINA's full Name, but remembers having seen him briefly in New York In 1051. MOLINA is age 63/64, white, 5'8" tall, 170 lbs.

In view of the growing number of cases involving attempts to ransom Cuban political prisoners, it may be that MOLINA is playing an active role in the release of his brother and possibly others. If the BUSTAMANTE concerned is BUSTAMANTE O'Leary, the trusted headshrinker of the regime, then this report may indicate that ho is cooperating, with or without regime knowledge, in obtaining the release of certain political prisoners.

/Operational - Information on Dr Jose BUSTAMENTE O'Leary, Psychiatrist (201-022396).

Reference: DIRECTOR 27502

1. The following was prepared by

2. The information below was acquired through interrogation of CC-4033, Dr. Hector WILTZ Lancis, a Cuban refugee and former resident of Nuevo Vedado, Habana, who left Cuba on 19 March 1969 and has been a professional colleague of Subject for many years.

a. Dr. Jose *BUSTAMENTE* O'Leary, psychiatrist, was brought up by his aunts; he does not know the identity of his mother. He, together with Raul Roa, Justo Carrillo, and others, comes from the ranks of the left wing of the student movement: he joined the Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1944, supported presidential candidate Dr. Carlos Saladrigas in the presidential elections held that year. When Dr. Grau was elected President, Subject concentrated on his professional activities, earning considerable prestige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining his political relationships with senators, colonos, etc. In 1952, the year of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente had such friendly relations with both presidential candidates that, if the general elections scheduled for June 1952 had been held, Subject would have been made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agramonte had been elected, and (b) Minister without cartera (portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been elected.

b. After the 10 March 1952 coup d'etat, Subject opposed the de facto government in spite of his ciose relations with Dr. MORALES del Castillo, who offered Subject the post of Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consultivo) which post Subject rejected. Subject began to conspire against the regime with Justo Carrillo and Dr. Araujo, constituting the organization called the Montecristi Group. Subject continues to maintain a close relationship with Dr. Araujo, now President of the Cuban Medical College, Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of Havana University, and functionary of the Higher Nervous Activity Research Institute.

c. After the 1 January 1959 Revolution, Subject hastened to exploit the Communist content of the Revolution and participated directly in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia. One of Urrutia's assistants was Subject's patient and informed Subject of events occurring within the Presidential Palace. Subject then consulted with Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-Communist.

d. Subject is very intelligent, very competent, and an extraordinarily hard worker. He is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University Medical School, and Director of the Higher Nervous Activity Research Institute. During the decade 1950-60, he held a high post within the Cuban Medical College and was President of the World Medical Group; during this decade he made many visits to the USA on matters related to his professional activities.

e. It has been commented that Subject performed "brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE. During the period in 1966 that subsource was held prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject; subsource has never heard anyone state that he actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT, it was probably as professor of psychology in classes given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that the classes would have been similar to those that Subject gave to Cuban artists.

f. In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily beautiful mistress that he still continues to visit and support. This mistress, Manolita Canto, was divorced by her husband, Salup (fnu) after a private detective hired by the husband surprised Subject and Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida; subsequently, U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subject from entering the U.S.A. Canto had had one son by her husband; when her husband died, the son inherited the father's wealth, which was considerable. The laws against private property promulgated by the Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position to the point that she has had to go to work; she now works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute), located at 23 and L Streets, Vedado, Havana City.

CONTINUATION OF

SECRET

OSALA - 25559

Subject surrendered his private practice to the Cuban Government, and receives only his salary as Director of the Higher Nervous Activity Research Institute, which salary amounts to 800 Cuban pesos; this salary is insufficient to permit Subject to maintain his own home and his mistress's separate home and to lead the type of life to which he was accustomed.

g. Subject is described as lacking in normal affections, cold and calculating, a typical schizoid interested only in himself, never makes a friendly gesture, has almost no friends. Subject is generally disliked and has many enemies who feel real hate towards him. The young Revolutionary medical doctors refuse to have anything to do with him. Fidel Castro does not know who Subject is and has certainly never been treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment from any other psychiatrist. Subject must be very un- happy and downcast at his present situation: His income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life; he no longer travels extensively abroad (formerly, he traveled abroad every three months); he holds no representative office; he is not politically or socially prominent and, indeed, no one pays him the slightest attention. Subsource states categorically that he believes that "Dr. Bustamente would be willing to accept any offer. He would take the bait if given half a chance."

h. The trip that Subject made to the USSR in the early 1960's was a "pleasure trip." So far as subsource knows, Subject received no training in the USSR.

i. Subject is not known to have any relations with SovBloc officials in Havana. He does maintain close relations: with (Dr) LOPEZ Sanchez (Inu), an old-guard Communist of the so-called microfaction who holds the post of Secretary of the Cuban Academy of Sciences.

j. Fidel Castro is a pathological schizo- paranoid reform-type personality, which personality type is characterized by latent homosexuality.

k. Raul Castro is just the opposite of what he appears to be and is more "human" than Fidel Castro; he has founded a home, takes an interest in his family, etc. le suffers from a homosexual complex, as denoted by his hoarse voice.

l. Armando Hart is a hysterical type who believes that his wife dominates him. His wife suffers from a complex based on the fact that she is much older than he.

1. (Summary: The National Center for Scientific Research (CNIC) is an autonomous organization controlled by the Office of the Prime Minister, who appointed the Director, Dr. Wilfredo Torres, M.D., and other important executives. The CNIC exists basically to perform scientific research and to train personnel for employment as (a) CNIC researchers, (b) researchers for the National Research Institutes that collaborate with the CNIC, (c) medical school faculty members, (d) industrial scientists, (e) and researchers and workers in the pure sciences. The CNIC has departments of Biochemistry, Ultracentrifugation, Electronic Microscopy, Medical Botany, Microbidogy and Virology, and Bio-mechanics and Biomedical Studies. The CNIC graduate training program for medical doctors confers the degree of Doctor of Basic Sciences upon completion of the three-year pogram; in the future, the CNIC will also graduate Doctors of Pure Sciences The National Research Institutes, of which there are at least 1 are organized by medical specialties and work in coordination with the CNIC but are subordinate to the MINSAP. All are clinical research institutes that work primarily with patients. These institutes include the Institutes of Endocrinology, Nephrology, Hematology, Gastroenterology, Neurology and Neuro-surgery, Physiopathology, Psychology and Neurophysiology, Hygiene and Epidemiology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery, Microbiology and Virology, Angiology, and Parasitology.)

2. The National Center for Scientific Research (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas, CNIC) is located in Reparto Siboney (formerly Country Club), Marianao, Havana Pro-vince, next to the Victoria de Giron premedical school (formerly Colegio Sagrado Corazon), and occupies several impressive new buildings; in addition, large private homes in the area have been equipped as laboratories and residences for CNIC personnel. As of mid-November 1967, some of the residences were occupied by foreign scientists.

3. The CNIC is an autonomous organization controlled by the Office of the Prime Minister, through which its funds are budgeted. Important matters concerning the CNIC are handled personally by Fidel Castro, whose approval is required for foreign exchange expenditures such as the purchase of equipment. contracting of foreign personnel, trips abroad by CNIC per-sonnel, and recruiting campaigns aimed at foreign scientists. Fidel Castro, rather than ex-Minister Machado Ventura, appointed the director and other important CNIC executives. Dr. Wilfredo Torres, M.D., hematologist, is CNIC director. The Public Health Ministry (MINSAP) plays no part in the supervision of the CNIC and cannot influence the decisions of its executives.

4. The organization and functions of the CNIC are con-fidential although not secret, and any person who has contact with medical professors can acquire some information on the CNIC. Since about June 1967, an ID card issued by the CNIC to its employces is required to enter the CNIC buildings and the private homes that have been equipped as laboratories and resi-dences.

5. CNIC activities are oriented towards three fundamental objectives, namely:

a. Scientific research related to the medical sciences.

b. The preparation of highly qualified research and professorial personnel for employment, after gradu-ation, as (1) CNIC researchers, (2) researchers of The National Research Institutes (see blow),

(3) members of the faculty of the three Cuban medical
schools (referred to as schools of medical sciences)
located in Havana City, Santa Clara, and Santiago de
Cuba, and (4) biochemists and microbidogists in indus-
tries related to the medical sciences, such as the
pharmaceutical industry.

c. The preparation of personnel for work in the pure
sciences; this third objective constitutes a more
ambitious but long-range goal that was still in the
organizational and planning stage in January 68. Part
of the personnel so trained would remain at the Center
as CNIC researchers; part would join the faculties of
the university schools of pure sciences, and part would
enter Cuban industry to work on the applications of
technology to production.

## Scientific Research

6. Scientific research related to the medical sciences
   is done at both the CNIC and at the National Research Institutes.
   The general directives for such research are oriented towards:

a. The experimental verification of conclusions arrived at,
or discoveries made, by foreign scientists. This work
of verification is effected (1) principally in order
to train Cuban personnel in the methods of higher re-.
search, but also (2) as an attempt to contribute in-
formation complementary to the discovery.

b. Original research work done by Cuban personnel advised
by foreign scientists. This work is directed towards
(1) the attainment of results of international impor-
tance to be used in propaganda praising Castro's
education system, and (2) the achievement of discoveries
in applied science that would serve either as an econ-
omic saving or to earn foreign exchange. As of mid-
January 68, CNIC research projects had produced nothing
of scientific importance. During the first half of 67,
Fidel Castro ordered the CNIC to orient all its re-
search projects towards production technology so that
the foreign exchange invested in the projects could be
partially recovered through improved production.

7. Department of Biochemistry. The most important of the
   CNIC departments is the Department of Biochemistry; it occupies
   several new buildings and former private homes. It is headed by
   Dr. Mora (fnu), a Chilean microbiologist. This department was
   conducting research on polarimetry, enzymology, spectography,
   and the synthesis of a steroid hormone from stigmasterol, a
   sugar-cane by product.

8. As of mid-January 1968, all attempts to synthesize a
   steroid hormone from stigmasterol had failed and will almost
   surely continue to fail because stigmasterol is an inert
   steroid lacking in biological activity.

9. Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, M.D., was preparing a resco.ch
   thesis for the degree of Doctor of Basic Sciences; his research
   project, the biochemistry of lipides in cardiovascular diseases,
   is of scientific interest although not of international impor-
   tance.

10. Department of Ultracentrifugation. Although nominally
    a separate department, the Department of Ultracentrifugation
    in fact functions as a subdivision of the Department of Bio-
    chemistry. As of mid-November 1967 it contained the most modera


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

Page 4 of 12 Pages
CS-311/07089-68

centrifuges then available. Its hasic function is the analysis or separation of the diverse elements that constitute a bio- logical substance.

11. Department of Electronic Microscopy. This department was functioning in November 1967 and contained two electron micro- scopes of the highest quality, one Polish-made and the other believed to be Japanese. It was performing research in cytology, ultrastructure (the altramicroscopic structure of tissues of living beings), crystallography, and the three-dimensional spatial structure of certain biological substances.

12. Department of Medical Botany. This department is headed by a very intelligent and cultured Spanish agroncist named Guillermo Cid who has been in Cuba since 1940. It is effecting a systematic study of Cuban flora in order to determine the pharmacological and therapeutical properties of Cuban plants. The department works in coordination with the experimental station in Santiago de las Vegas that is directed by the eminent 92-year old Dr. Juan Tomas Roig Mesa, who is the greatest Cuban expert on Cuban and tropical Tlora and one of the greatest authorities in the world on medicinal plants. In addition, the department has the cooperation of all the experimental agron- omical stations in Cuba, which send the department samples of any plant considered worth investigation; the department con- ducts an exhaustive analysis of such samples. The research has two objectives:

a. The utilization of the curative properties of the plants, which constitute a cheap supply of national raw materials and can replace many imported pro- ducts.

b. The launching on the world market of competitive pharmaceutical products, following the example of Red China and Bulgaria.

13. The work of the Department of Medical Botony will pro- bably be successful because of (a) the qualifications and com- petence of its director, Guillermo Cid, (b) the extraordinary impulse that has been imparted to its research program, and (c) the extraordinary richness of Cuban flora in medicinal plants.

14. Department of Microbilogy and Virology. This depart- ment is very well equipped and manned. It has ultracentrifuges and isolated installations for virus cultures, and installations for experimental animals.

15. Biomechanics and Biomedical Studies. Biomechanics is the study of the biological activity of living organisms from the point of view of the physicochemical laws that govern them. As of September 1966, a department that would do research on bio- mechanics was being organized within the CNIC. The Cuban Govern- ment is aware of the enormous medical importance of the appli- cation of cybernetics (problem solving by electronic computers) to the analysis, organization, and resolution of the very complex physicochemical problems that the biology of living beings pre- sents; the Government is attempting to organize this department, which will train highly qualified personnel and import electronic computers (a) for the study of the complex physicochemical pro- blems related principally to hematology, neurophysiology, and cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, and (b) for the computa- tion for public health purposes of the vast amounts of public-- health data of different types that the MINSAP regiond organi- zations would provide.

16. The research projects of this department were to be directed fundamentally towards the study and electronic computation of the modification ir both healthy and sick persons or such: biological parameters as hemodynamic curves, concentration and saturation of gases and alterations in the basic acid equilibrium of the blood, and were to include the study of the variations in the biological parameters from the biochemical and hemodynamic point of view during cardiovascular surgery and in physiological research related to the cardiovascular apparatus. In neurophysiology and neuropharmacology, the research projects would be oriented towards research on higher nervous activity including electrical modifications produced in higher nervous activity; in hematology, the projects would be oriented towards the study of isoimmunization and pathological alterations of the different blood cells. The electronic computers would be needed to process the immense quantities of data such research would produce.

17. Dr. Fernando J. Toro, a medical doctor who is also an electrical engineer, was to head this department. Toro is reputed to be very intelligent, a gifted organizer, highly motivated, and by far the best man available in Cuba for the type of research described; he has more than 20 years experience in electromedical instruments.

18. Reduced Number of Research Projects. The scarcity of research projects can easily be explained by the fact that Cuba, which has no considerable scientific tradition, must first train personnel in the higher methods of scientific research, and such training requires years of effort. The few persons prepared to do important research are at the present time occupied in the administrative and pedagogical organization of the CNIC and cannot work full-time as researchers.

19. Research in Antibiotics. In 1960, Dr. Jose Antonio Padron, an eminent research scientist, began work on the isolation and culture of antibiotic substances, the study of their properties, and experimentation with said substances; he ini. tiated this work at the Oncological Hospital but is now a CNIC collaborator. As of December 1967, he had isolated and exhaustively studied 89 new antibiotics, many of which are too toxic for human use. His work demonstrates his great ability and perserverance, and with the material resources of the CNIC at his disposal, should result in discoveries of scientific importance.

CNIC Training Program

20. Doctor of Basic Sciences. The CNIC offers a three-year training program leading to the degree of Doctor of Basic Sciences for which program fifth-year medical students with exceptional academic standing can qualify if (a) during their college career they have shown special aptitudes for teaching and research, (b) the UJC gives them an "A" grade in political standing or reliability, and (c) they are cleared by a DSE investigation. In 1966, of the students then in the fifth year of medical school, only six were accepted by this training program; all were excellent students and UJC members and are now medical doctors: Ramon Ortiz, Rosa Elena Simeon, Ismael Clark Arce, Hilda Donderis, Julio Rodriguez Docal, and his wife Maira (lnu). As of April 1968, probably no more than 30 students were studying in this training program, chiefly because of the rigorous entrance requirements.

21. During the first year of the three-year program, the students, all of whom are wedical edical doctors, study (a) mathematics: mathematical analysis (higher algebra), analytical geometry, and trigonometry; (b) physics: mechanics (kinematics, statics, and dynamics), mechanics of liquids and gases, and heat; (c) chemistry; inorganic and organic; (d) languages (Rosier, English, French, or German); dialectical and histori- wal materialism; and logic of science. The classes occupy both mornings and afternoons and include seminars given by the professors; under a rotation system, the students also give seminars in which each by turn first lectures on presides over the ensuing debate. In addition, the students review the bibliography of subjects related to medicine, such as studies on biochemistry, pharmacology, etc.

22. During the second year of the three-year program, the students continue to study the pure sciences: mathematics . (infinitesimal analysis), physics (optics and electromagnetism), and organic chemistry, plus dialectical and historical material- ism, languages, and a specific medical speciality selected by the individual student. In addition, the students serve as instructors of biochemistry, physiology, etc., at the Victoria de Giron premedical school.

23. During the third year, each student (a) continues to serve as an instructor at the Victoria de Giron premedical school, (b) continues to study in his own specialty, such as biochemistry, neurophysiology, electronic microscopy, genetics, virology, etc., (c) undertakes an original research project under the guidance of a professor who is usually a foreigner, (d) writes a thesis based on the research project, presents it, and defends it before a tribunal, and (e) completes an examina- tion in the specialty he has chosen. If the thesis is approved and the student passes the examination in his specialty, he receives the title of Doctor of Basic Sciences and either becomes a' member of the faculty of one of the three Cuban medical schools (Paragraph 5.b.above) or stays on at the CNIC as a research assistant.

24. During the first year, students receive 225 Cuban pesos monthly. During the second year they receive 250 pesos monthly, and during the third year they receive 300 pesos monthly. In addition, the students receive a free lunch and supper daily.

25. In late 1968, the CNIC will graduate its first two Doctors of Basic Sciences: Dr. Carlos J. Finlay, M.D., who studied in France, and Morlan (fnu), who studied in Rumania; both will remain at the CNIC after graduation and do research in biochemistry.

26. Doctor of Pure Sciences. Candidates for the CNIC training program leading to the degree of Doctor of Pure Sciences must satisfy requirements similar to those described in paragraph 20 above: candidates must be outstanding students in one of the pure sciences (chemical, physical, mathematical, or biological sciences) who, throughout their entire college career have demonstrated special aptitudes for teaching and scientific research, and who are Communist sympathizers approved by the UJC.

Victoria de Giron Institute of Basic Sciences

27. The Victoria de Giron Institute, located next to the CNIC, is the only school of is type in Cuba. Rather than a

medical school, it is an organism attached to Havana Univer-
sity Medical School. Students wishing to study medicine or
stomatology at Havana University must study first two years
as boarding students at the Victoria de Giron Institute.
Neither Santiago de Cuba nor Santa Clara has a similar insti-
tute.

28. As of September 1967, students from Las Villas,
    Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces who desire to enter medical
    school as first-year students must matriculate at either
    Santa Clara or Santiago de Cuba University; this measure was
    put into effect in order to reduce congestion at Havana Uni-
    versity.

## National Research Institutes

29. The following National Research Institutes, organized
    by medical specialties, work in coordination with the CNIC but
    are subordinate to the MINCAP. All were organized as "insti-
    tutes" during the first three months of 1967, although some had
    been functioning for years under different names. All are
    clinical research institutes that work primarily with patients.
    Each institute controls all the hospital departzents throughout
    Cuba that correspond to the specialty of the institute. For
    example: The Endocrinology Institute controls all the hospital
    departments of endocrinology in Cuba.

30. Endocrinology Institute. The Endocrinology Institute
    replaced the former Institute for Endocrinological Research
    that was founded and directed by Dr. Yamil Kouri. The insti-
    tute is located at the same site as the former institute: the
    ground floor of the left wing of the Fajardo Hospital, Havana
    City. It is headed by Dr. Oscar Mateo de Acosta, M.D., Cuba's
    most eminent endocrinologist. Dr. Mateo is extraordinarily
    intelligent, a university professor and PCC member, and is one
    of the scientific bulwarks of the Castro Regime. Mateo's
    assistants include Dr. Catalina Eibenschuz, who is married to
    Dr. Mora, head of the CNIC Department of Biochemistry, and
    was studying endocrincology in France in early 68; Dr. Barto-
    lome Arce, who studied in Rumania and was studying in France
    in early 68; and a young medical doctor named Oviedo (fnu),
    who was probably to be sent to Sweden to study.

31. The Endocrinology Institute enjoys a large budget
    because of Dr. Mateo's scientific eminence and political.
    "virtues". It has excellent equipment for electrophoresis,
    ultracentrifuges, and photocolorimeters.

32. Nephrology Institute. The Nephrology Institute is
    located on the fifth floor of the Joaquin Albarran Clinical-
    Surgical Hospital, Avenida 26 at Avenida Kancho Boyeros, Havana.
    It is headed by Dr. Abelardo Buch, M.D., an extraordinarily
    researcher who was working on:

a. acute, chronic renal insufficiency,

b. microdeterminations of certain normal quantities of
the renal apparatus, and

c. the experimental verification of modern theories
that explain the physiopathology of shock and its
treatment; his experiments were based on the research
hypothesis of Dr. Richard Lillehei, chief of-the---
Department of Surgery, Minnesota University.

33. The institute has two artificial kidneys: one imported from the United States in 1959, and one imported from Czechoslovakia and installed in November or December 1966. An attempt has been made to organise the institute like the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Roberto Manalich and Dr. Viilalba (fnu) work witl. Dr. Buch.

34. In January 1968, the MINSAP created a three-year residency in nephrology and appointed Dr. Frankie Dorticos as the first resident; Dorticos is the son of the Dean of the Havana University Medical School and nephew of President Dorticos. Artifical kidneys were installed at bot the Santa Clara Civil Hospital and the Santiago de Cuba Hospital in late 1967; these artificial kidneys are for use in treating kidney disease rather than for medical research.

35. Hematology Institute. The Hematology Institute has departments at the William Soler Hospital, the Fajardo Hospital, and the National Hospital, all located in Havana City. The institute has no building of its own and its activities are located at the three best hematological clinics in Cuba, as enumerated above. The Director of the Hematology Institute is Dr. Eduardo de la Torre, who is also chief of the Department of Hematology, William Soler Hospital. Dr. Ulacia (fnu), who is probably Cuba's best hematologist, is chief of the Department of Hematology of the Fajardo Hospital.

36. The most important research project of the Hematology Institute was initiated about July 66 and consisted of the study of the "atilization of isoniazida in the treatment of Werholf's (as received) disease purpura trombopenica idio- patica." The value of isoniazida in the treatment of Werholf's disease was discovered by chance under the following circumstances: A cl.ild hospitalized in the hematological department of the William Soler hospital for treatment of Werholf's disease contracted a primary tuberculosis infection; when this infection was treated with isoniazida, the symptom-complex of Werholf's disease disappeared completely and no relapse occurred: As of January 1968, 22 such cases had been studied and the conclusions were being prepared for presentation at a Hematological Congress; the biological mechanism of the treatment had not yet been determined, but it was considered that the experimental stage had been completed.

37. Dr. Eduardo de la Torre was performing research principally of a statistical nature on leucemias. Infantile leucemia was being studied at the William Soler Hospital and at the Angel Arturo Aballi Children's Hospital, located in Arroyo Naranjo, liavana; this research followed the treatment scheme of Swelzer and the University of California scheme known internationally as V.A.M.P.

38. Gastroenterology Institute. The Gastroenterology Institute occupies the two-story building at the Calixto Garcia Hospital which was formerly occupied by the hospital library. Its Director is Dr. Raimundo Llanio Navarro, who was brought to world-wide eminence when he presented his study "Colangio- grafia Laparoscopica en la Lactante" at the Brussels Congress in 1965. When the Gastroenterology Institute was officially established in early 1967, it had been functioning for about two years. In January 1967, Dr. Humberto Rodriguez Hidalgo and Dr. Mirna Quintero were admitted as residents; their admission as residents coincided with the establishment at the institute. of atraining program for specialists in gastroenterology.

39. As of mid-1966, Dr. Llanio was conducting a study of thousands of his own cases of laparoscopy in general, gynecologic laparoscopy, and laparoscopy in pediatrics. dis assistants were Dr.. Oscar Garcias, and Dr. Arcadio Soto Escovar, also employed as instructor of the Department of Internal Medicine, Havana University Medical School.

40. In August 1966, the ground floor of the institute contained the most modern radiological equipment in Cuba, including X-ray machines and fluoroscopes; each of the machines had a seriografo and occupied a square room measuring about four meters Square. There two rooms for laparoscopic examinations and four c. five wards with a total of approximately 50 beds. On the ground floor there were also eight small rooms (4 x 2 reters) for biliary drainages and gastroquimogramas, the Department of Electrophoresis, a conference hall, a laboratory of pathological anatomy, a clinical laboratory, three or four bedrooms for resident physicians, two waiting rooms for out-patients, and the Department of Coloprotologia (Proctology?), headed by Dr. Oscar Garcia, Cuba's best proctologist, who is also Vice Rector of Havana University and Vice President of the MINSAP Scientific Council. The second floor contained a library for which volumes were beginning to be received, and several rooms still unequipped that would be used for research to be conducted by Dr. Llanio ir person.

41. Neurology and Neurosurgery Institute. The Neurology and Neurosurgery Institute functions at two separate installations. Its headquarters is located in the former building of the Governing Board of the Calixto Garcia Hospital, which also contains the Department of Psychiatry of the Calixto Garcia Hospital. This building contains the neurosurgical installations of the institute, consisting in three splendidly equipped operating rooms, two or three rooms containing radiological equipment, a laboratory of pathological anatomy, out patient examination rooms. conference room, library, filing room about 70 beds, and bedrooms for residents and interns. The building was totally rebuilt in 1965 and equipped with U.S. $100,000 worth of new instruments and equipment.

42. The Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery (formerly the Medical-Surgical Center), located on 29th and D Streets, Vedado, Havana City, also belongs to the institute. Dr. Razon Estrada, Director of the Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, is Professor of Neuroanatomy, was trained in the United States and is described as extraordinarily able; he maintains a degree of medical rivalry with the Director of the Neurology and Neurosurgery Institute, Drl Filiberto Ramirez Corria, that makes the hospital an autonomous organization although it functions ia coordination with the institute. The hospital has about 275 beds and is a modern class "A" hospital; residents in internal medicine must spend three months in intensive study at this hospital.

43. Physiopathology Institute. The Institute of Physiopathology was in the process of organization. It will probabi. be headed by Chilean biochemist Dr. Mora (fnu) who, until abowi October 67, held thepost of director of post-graduate scientific training (responsable de superacion cientifica) of the CNIC, and who is now head of the Department of Biochemistry, CNIC. Dr. Mora and Dr. Ruth Urba, another Chilean microbiologist, introduced into Cuba the modern concepts of medical biochemistry and created a model Department of Medical Biochemistry at th Victoria de Giron Institute of Basic Sciences. Urba, who left Cuba some time ago, Mora, and Yamil Kouri vere the brains ce

the organization of the CHIC. The date upon which the Institute of Physiopathology wiil begin to function cannot be established inasmuch as Mora, who has the degree of Doctor of Bicchemistry, must first receive his degree as a medical doctor.

41. Psychology and Neurophysiology Institute. The Psychology and Neurophysiology Institute (formerly the Higher Nervous Activity Institute) occupies the building formerly occupied by the Banco de Piedad, in Reparto Alturas del Vedado, Havana City. The institute is headed by Jose Angel Bustamante, M.D., who is very intelligent and very well örganized. As of mid-May 1966, the ground floor contained the lobby, three rooms used for psychiatric care, a sicofarmaco storeroom, the Department of Neuropharmacology, two small rooms for experimental surgery, about 20 cages for experimental animals, three rooms containing electromedical instruments used by Dr. Toro (see paragraph 17) in his research work, including three electroencephalographs, two electrocardiographs, electro- miografos, ammeters, voltmeters, etc., two or three rooms for animals in which scientific instruments have been imbedded for the experimentai verification of certain physiological data, two rooms used to study conditioned reflexes in rats, a long corridor (about. 30 meters long) equipped with bells, lights, and gates, in which Dr. Diego Gonzalez was studying sintesis aferente de Anoysien, two rooms in which Dr. Jose Aquino as conducting experiments on the effects of ouabaina on the central nervous system, and other undescribed experiments. The second floor contained the files, library, conference hall, and rooms for which no specific function had yet been determined.

45. As of May 1966, Dr. Bustamante was doing research on social psychology (the psychological characteristics of indi-...
    viduals belonging to a specific socioeconomic group) and had very ambitious plans to use electronic data processing machines to study the electrochemical processes and the servomechanisms of higher nervous activity; these ambitious plans were to be put into effect in 1967. The land located behind the institute was to serve for the construction of other departments of the institute.

46. Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute. The Hygiere and Epidemiology Institute functions at two separate installations. Institute headquarters and its hygiene section occupy a building on Calle Infanta, Havana City. Dr. Cosme Ordoñez, M.D., is director of the institute; he is described as very intelligent and very well-organized. During the first six months of 1967 he took a course in hygiene and epidemiology at the University of London. Dr. Plasencia (fnu) is another of the principal figures at the institute.

47. Public health data received from all parts of Cuba are processed at the institute headquarters on Calle Infanta (DOJ: September 1966). In addition to the hygiene section institute headquarters contains a well-equipped Virology Department, which has an electron microscope, a well-equipped Serums and Vaccines Department, a school for public-health workers, and a school of medical statisticians.

48. The epidemiological section of the institute is located at Las Animas Anti-infectious Hospital, Havana, at which medical care is provided and research work done. Las Animas Hospital was totally rebuilt during the period 1962-65 and is a model hospital that compares favorably with any other

hospital in the world; its medical training program is excel- lent. The hospital consists of a main two-story building that As connected by passageways' and corridors to a number of one- story clinics that are isolated from each other. The ground floor of the main building contains the vestibule, receiving section, duty rooms, classrooms, operating room, and library The second floor contains living quarters for the resident physicians. Hospital Director is Dr. Julio Capote Perez.

48. The clinics that are connected to the main building are:

a. Tetanus and Diphtheria Clinic, with two wards with a total of about 35 beds for diphtheria patients and two wards with about 15 beds for tetanus patients. Near the entrance to the clinic are three rooms con- taining five iron Jungs for polio patients.

b. Viral Hepatitis Clinic, headed by Dr. Martinez (fnu), has about 50 beds.

c. Clinic for Typhoid Fever and High-Fever Producing Diseases (Enfermedades Febriles Agudas), with about 35 beds,

d. Clinic for Mumps and Severe Exanthematic Diseases, headed by Dr. Julio Capote, who is also Director of the hospital. This clinic has about 30 beds.

50. The Clinic for Infectious Diseases of the Central Nervous System is unconnected to the main hospital building. The hospital also has a pathalogical anatomy laboratory, a clinical analysis laboratory, and a two-story building for ex- perimental animals. Plans existed to build three more clinics (DOI: 1967).

51. As of September 1966, the following research work was being performed at Las Animas Hospital:

a. Hospital Director Capote was doing research on (1) the treatment of encefalitis sarampioniosa, and (2) an antimeasles vaccine provided by the USSR.

b. Dr. Julio Romulo Calvet was completing his research studies on (1) tetanus and had achieved original con- tributions concerning the etiopatogenia of tetanus, (2) the prognosis of patients with exotoxins circula- ting in the blood, (3) a screening test for diverse therapeutical procedures to combat tetanus, and (4) the elaboration of a hyperimmune human vaccine for use with pereons already suffering from tetanus, or for use as a prophylactic medicine. Dr. Romulo has 28 years experience in infectious-contagious diseases and is one of the world's greatest authorities on diphtheria and tetanus.

52. Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surger Institute. TES institute is headed by Dr. Noel Gonzalez and is located at Le Fajardo Hospital, where it has the following installations:

a. Second and third floor: two operating rooms for the exclusive use of the institute. The rooms contain machines for extracorporeal circulation, instruments for the determination of hemodynamic curves, multi- cardiographs, vectocardiografos, balistocardiografos, equipment for cardiovascular (radiology" (X-rays ?),

equipment for intracardiac catheterism, electronic
defibrillators, automatic respirators, and extra-
thoracic pacing devices. Either the second or third
floor contains a storeroom with the most modern
medicines known for use in cardiovascular diseases.
The third floor also contains a Department of Cardio-
logy and Hemodynamic. Research that is splendidly equip-
ped and is directed by Dr. Hernandez Cañero (fnu),
one of Cuba-s best cardiologists; the surgical research
that was being done included mitral commissurotomies,
valvuloplastias, correction of septal defects, sur-
gical correction of the ductus arteriosus, the im-
plantation of intrathoracic pace makers, and heart
transplants in animals. Institute Directo. Gonzalez
is assisted in cardiovascular surgery by L.. Roberto
Menchaca, Dr. Roberto Guerra, Dr. Llaca, Dr. Arango,
and Dr. Kiljian.

b. Sixth floor: a ward with approximately 40 beds.

53. Because of Director Noel Gonzalez's executive capacity,
    professional ability, and political relations, this institute has
    received strong economic support since mid-1966. In December 67,
    Dr. Roberto Guerra and Dr. Roberto Menchaca were preparing to
    leave for Europe where they would spend approximately one year
    studying and purchasing surgical equipment for the institute.

54. Microbiology and Virology Institute. This institute
    is in the process of organization. It will have departments in.
    the CNIC and in the headquarters building of the Hygiene and
    Epidemiology Institute, Calle Infanta, Havana City.

55. Angiology Institute. The Angiology Institute is located
    on the second floor of the Luaces Clinic, Calixto Garcia Hospital,
    and is directed by Dr. Jorge MacCook, one of Cuba's best angio-
    logists.. The activities of this institute are oriented basical-
    ly towards the treatment of patients and the instruction of
    medical students. The chief Cuban angiologists are Dr. MacCook,
    Dr. Francisco Bidart Labourdette, Director of Angiology at the
    Clinical-Surgical Hospital, and Dr. Huguet. (fnu), Director of
    Angiology, National Hospital.

56. Parasitology Institute. This institute occupies the
    former Parasitology Clinic of the Calixto Garcia Hospital. Dr.
    Pedro Kouri was to have been named Director but died before the
    institute was formally organized. The institute's activities
    are oriented principally towards the treatment of patients and
    the instruction of medical students.

57. Oncology Institute. As of late 1967, the official
    creation of an institute to be named the Oncology Institute was
    under consideration; said institute would be headed by Dr.
    Zoilo Marinello Vidaurreta, who presides the Scientific Council
    of the MINSAP and is the director of the Oncological Hospital,
    29th and C Streets, Vedado, Havana City. An organization similar
    to the projected Oncology Institute has been functioning at
    the Oncological Hospital for about two years.

DOI: LATE JANUARY 1968

SUBJECT: COMMENTS BY CUBAN OFFICIALS ON THE RECENT DENUNCIATIONS AND PURGES IN CUBA OF ANIBAL ESCALANTE AND OTHER OLD-GUARD COMMUNISTS

ACO: 30-31 JANUARY 1968 (FIELD REPORT NO. HMM-11,547)

SOURCE: ESTERN EUROPEAN BUSINESS EXECUTIVE OF PROVEN RELIABILITY. HE TRAVELS FREQUENTLY TO CUBA, AND HAS OBTAINED INFORMATION FROM HIGH-LEVEL ECONOMIC OFFICIALS OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. HE ACQUIRED THE INFORMATION FROM A CUBAN OFFICIAL WHO IS INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH BOTH JOAQUIN ALVAREZ REMENTOL AND DR. JOSE ANGEL BUSTAMANTE.

1. (FIELD COMMENT: WITH RESPECT TO THE INFORMATION IN PARAGRAPH TWO, BELOW, WHILE IT MIGHT BE ASSUMED THAT JOAQUIN ALVAREZ REMENTOL WOULD NORMALLY FOLLOW THE OFFICIAL CUBAN LINE, THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE KNOWN TO EXIST BETWEEN HIM AND THE

CUBAN OFFICIAL, AND BETWEEN THAT OFFICIAL AND THE SOURCE, ARE
SUCH AS TO PERMIT THE SELIEF THAT HE WAS SPEAKING FRANKLY.)

2. ACCORDING TO JOAQUIN ALVAREZ REMENTOL, CUBAN VICE-
   MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE IN CHARGE OF NORTH AMERICAN AND
   WESTERN EUROPENAN AFFAIRS, THE RECENT PURGE BY FIDEL CASTRO OF
   A NUMBER OF OLD-GUARD COMMUNISTS, INCLUDING ANIBAL ESCALANTE,
   WILL NOT HAVE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES. FROM THE INTERNAL POINT OF
   VIEW, THE PURGE AND THE CONDEMNATION OF ESCALANTE ARE ESSEN-
   TIALLY A DEMONSTRATION OF FORCE ON THE PART OF CASTRO AND A
   WARNING TO THE USSR AND OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTIRIES, AS WELL AS
   TO THE CUBANS, THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT IN WHOSE HANDS POWER
   LIES IN CUBA. THE PURGE AND ARRESTS CSHOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT
   ON ECONOMIC RELATIONS SETWEEN CUBA AND THE USSK. FROM A BRIEF
   TALK WITH GERMAN AMADO BLANCO, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE OFFICIAL
   WHO RECENLTY RETURNED FROM MOSCO AFTER HAVING SPENT MONTHS
   NEGOTIATING A COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, ALVAREZ REMENTOL CONCLUDED
   THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN CUBAN-SOVIET
   ECONOMIC RELATIONS OR SOVIET ASSISTANCE, AND THERE MAY EVEN BE
   A FEW IMPROVEMENTS. THE SOVIETS WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN ES-
   SENTIAL ECONOMIC AID TO CUBA. THE RECENT PURGE AND ARRESTS SHOULD

NOT HAVE FAR-REACHING RPERCUSSIONS ON THE POLITICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CUBA AND THE USSR, AS NUMEROUS DIFFERENCES OF VIEWS HAVE EXISTED FOR SOME TIME AND ARE WELL KNOWN. THESE DIFFERENCES WILL PROBABLY NOT AFFECT THE ESSENCE OF CURRENT POLITICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. CASTRO KNOWS THAT THE USSR CANNOT GO BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT IN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL MEASURES DESIGNED TO PRESSURE HIM TO FOLLOW A POLICY MORE IN AGREEMENT WITH SOVIET INTEREST. HE CONTINUES TO GIVE OPEN SUPPORT TO ARMED STRUGGLES IN LATIN AMERICA, SUCH AS VENEZUELA, AND ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD IN COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO SOVIET POLICY. THIS POLICY OF INDEPENDENCE HAS WON CASTRO SYMPATHIES IN AND OUTSIDE CUBA. THE CUBANS, WHO LIKE OTHER LATIN AMERICANS HAVE A CERTAIN VANITY, LIKE TO THINK THAT THEY LIVE IN A SMALL BUT BRAVE COUNTRY WHICH IS "NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE PUT ANYTHING OVER ON IT."

3. ACCORDING TO DR. JOSE ANGEL BUSTAMANTE, HEAD OF THE FACULTY OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAVANA, THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT ANIBAL ESCALANTE WAS AN AGENT OF THE SOVIET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. (FIELD COMMENT: BUSTAMANTE HAS OFTEN BEEN ACCUSED OF, AND HAS DENIED, CLANDEST INE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUDAN MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

BUSTAMANTE POINTED OUT THAT ESCALANTE HAS LONG BEEN CONNECTED
WITH A SOVIET ADVISER OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR IN CUBA,
EVIDENTLY A KG3 AGENT, WHO INTRODUCED HIM TO HIS SUCCESSOR.
THE OFFICIAL DECLARATIONS MADE AGAINST ESCALANTE AND HIS GROUP,
PARTICULARLY THOSE OF RAUL CASTRO, PLACED THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF ANIBAL ESCALANTE ON THE USSR. BUSTAMANTE
NOTED THAT UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THERE WAS IN THE CUBAN MINISTRY
OF INTERIOR A FRENCH ADVISER AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE FRENCH
SURETE, WHO APPARENTLY WAS AT ODDS WITH SOVIET ADVISERS OVER
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE STATE SECURITY. BUSTAMANTE
HEARD ABOUT THIS FRENCHMAN VIA SEVERAL OF HIS FRENCH PATIENTS
OR CONTACTS, WHO TOLD HIM OF HAVING MET THE FRENCH ADVISER ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THE EXISTENCE OF THE FRENCH ADVISER WAS
CONFIRMED TO BUSTAMANTE BY A CUBAN DOCTOR FRIEND WHO ALSO WORKED
IN THE CUBAN MINISTRY OF INTERIOR. BUSTAMANTE INPLIED THAT THE
FRENCH ADVISER HAD RECENLTY RETURNED TO FRANCE.

4. (SOURCE COMMENT: IT IS THE OPINION OF A NUMBER OF
   KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSONS IN HAVANA THAT ESCALANTE WAS A SOVIET
   AGENT.)

Since the mailing situation between our countries is so terrible I have made arrangements to keep in touch with you via Mexico, so I enclose a visiting card of the Assistant to the Director, Sr. Enrico Varisco, who works for Laboratories Erba in Mexico City. This will be a liaison between us since I will send my correspondence to you through him and I beg of you to do the same.

Querido Compañero:

En noviembre 9 le escribí; al no recibir respuesta suya también le escribí el 17 de febrero aprovechando el paso por esa ciudad del compañero Holagren quién debía ponerla en correos allí.

Acabo de enterarme por la visita del amigo Enrico Verisco de que ha estado Ud. enfermo y que apenas hace unos días es que comienza a desarrollar sus actividades. Nada sabía en relación con la misma por las dificultades de comunicación que existen entre nosotros y me alegro enormemente de que el informe de Varisco incluya ya su restablecimiento.

Me informa Varisco que la Revista de la APAL, por razones de su enfermedad, no ha salido aún, lo que explica no haber llegado a mi poder pero que espera esté en la calle en los primeros días de Abril.

Me informa de que Ud. hubo de recibir mi foto y el Curriculum Vitae. Añado ahora a lo enviado en esa ocasión la elección de que he sido objeto como miembro de la IBRO (International Brain-Research Organization) así como miembro de la Interamerican Journal of Psych-ology, en calidad de Director Consultante.

En la carta del 17 de Febrero le hablaba del libro de Psicología Médica cuyo ler tomo ha sido publicado ya y le adjunto un ejemplar así como también el Indice del 20 tomo que saldrá para el mes de Julio. Lo fechan en que le enviaré un ejemplar.

El cuento al libro "Psicología Médica y sus enseñanzas en In-" en la inter citada carta, yo está en la Impren- listo para el mes de Julio.

La adjunto también un libre publicado por los editores del Hospital Psiquiátrico que recoge las opiniones calificadas del Prof. Izquierdo, en este momento estamos trabajando en un libro que recoge los seminarios

En noviembre 2 le escribí dándole a conocer mis actividades y adjuntándole el trabajo leído en Moscú puro su publicación en la Revista de la APAL, no he recibido respuesta, espero y por lo tanto no sé si la carta se habrá extraviado por esa razón vuelvo a escribirle y en este momento utilizo el acuse por esa unidad del compañero Titulo en cual ha de ponerla en correos allí y por tanto tengo la seguridad que ahora la reciba.

Le ruego haga me contacte entregándole su respuesta al Gerente de la Compañía Cubana de Aviación que me la envía con el piloto en turno, pues quisiera saber si va a publicar el trabajo.

Por otra parte espero a partir de ahora escribirle usando el piloto de la Cubana por lo que más cartas le llegarán.

Espero enviarle un libro de Psiquiatría Infantil que acaba de publicarse en La Habana escrito por un autor soviético.

¿Me adjunta también el trabajo que leí en Moscú, "Aprendizaje y neurosis?"

En la petición al director de la Revista de la APAL, le ruega hacer también sobre esto.

Acabo de revisar un tanto de Psicología Médica en tres horas del cual salí primero, el segundo está siendo impreso, debiendo salir en los primeros meses del año en curso, y ya casi he terminado el tercero.

Esto ya es un trabajo sui generis ya que lo he escrito de sugerencias, como estudio de resultados. Un índice previo de todos los capítulos; aquellos mismos muy aparecidos; aparece al final del índice y al regreso de publicaciones americanas aparecerán en el programa del curriculum ante parte del curso; el curso ha de terminarse con publicaciones de cómo aquel puede servir igualmente a los estudiantes y a los médicos.

Querido Amigo:

Hace tiempo no te escribo pues las ocupaciones me han embargado en forma insuperable.

En Madrid pude saber de ti por los compañeros asistentes al Congreso de Psiquiatría y asimismo pude tener la satisfacción de recibir el homenaje ofrecido por los compañeros Latinoamericanos en magnífico almuerzo. En el mismo me informaron del acuerdo del Congreso con relación a dicho homenaje y a mi futura nominación en el Consejo Asesor.

Espero asistir al Congreso de la IFEP en México en diciembre de este año y supongo habré de encontrarme allí contigo, Dávila, Matta de Gregorio, Seguin y otros compañeros.

Aprovecho la oportunidad ahora para informarte de nuestras actividades y te ruego me hagas saber de las tuyas por correo para estar mutuamente enterados.

Nuestro Instituto, que empezó sus actividades en 1962, tiene tres Departamentos: Neurofisiología, Psicología y Psicología Social, y fue fundado por la Escuela de Medicina llegando a formar parte de la Academia de Ciencias en 1955.

El Departamento de Neurofisiología está actualmente trabajando en las investigaciones siguientes:

a) Condición y Potenciales Evocados en la vía Auditiva.
b) Influencia de Cardiotónicos y otras Drogas sobre al reflejo Condicionado de Habituación.
c) Estudio de la actividad Eléctrica del Sistema Nervioso de la Zachrista Guanensis.

a) Inalizació de dafina apllégtiica. Influencias de diversas es- tructures cerebales sobre las clores.

El Departamento de Palonlaria está trabajando en estas Investigaciones:

a) Estudio de las variables participantes en la relación Médico- Paciente en Psicoterapia individual y en Psicoterapia de grupo.

b) Estabilidad manual y motivación.

c) Factores de la personalidad del médico en perturbaciones Iatrogé- nicas.

d) Motivación y actividad motris.

e) Hipnosis y aprendizaje.

El Departamento de Psicologia Social está realizando las siguientes investigaciones:

a) Encuesta de la actitud de los estudiantes de Medicina.

b) Comportamiento de inadaptados sociales en la Provincia de Camagüey

c) Estudio sobre la burocracia.

El Departamento de Psicología Social no es un laboratorio de Ciencias Sociales; no es un Departamento de Sociología, y si se quiere, no se rige por un concepto psicologizante de la sociología. Es un labo- retorio donde algunos aspectos sociales de nuestro medio son estudia- dos.

Por lo tanto, las investigaciones para estudiar las actitudes y opi- niones de los jóvenes estudiantes cubanos así como el estudio de las aspiraciones del hombre en los campos, en sus propias tierras con las grandes colectivas, se efectúan en este Departamento de Psicolo- gía Social.

Por primera vez en Cuba tenemos esta oportunidad ya que la Nación es, al fin, un gran laboratorio social donde profundos cambios se están ofreciendo a la mente investigadora, grandes posibilidades que si no se toman en consideración se perderían lamentablemente.

Como puede observarse, el estudio social se limita a aquellos aspec- tos peculiares no solo de nuestra tradición sino de los cambios ocu- rridos en nuestro país, así como las consecuentes modificaciones psi- cológicas que quedarán evidenciadas en nuestros Simposios.

Además de estos tres Departamentos, el Instituto tiene cuatro Seccio- nes: Electrónica, Estadística, Bibliografía y Publicaciones. En estos momentos, el personal que trabaja en el Instituto es como sigue: 6 profesores, 6 auxiliares, 3 psicólogos, 6 técnicos, 6 alumnos en Psicología y 6 en Psicología Social.

Como una aspiración final, trabajamos por la posible unificación de nuestros esfuerzos llevada a cabo por nuestros tres Departamentos para así poder alcanzar nuestra meta, esto es, los estudios inter-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

disciplinarizacion realizadas en campos hasta ahora desconocidos por no-sotros, are aspiración deseada por aquéllos que antes interesamos
gacibes: "fallos materiales y morales en la productividad y moti-vación en un grupo religioso de Cuba".

Para resumir, el objetivo de nuestro Instituto es el estudio de los niveles neurofisiológicos y psicológicos así como los aspectos socia-les que pueden ser de interés a nuestro país, tratando de alcanzar dentro de los límites de nuestros métodos de investigaciones la inte-gración Interdisciplinaria de nuestras disciplinas.

En estos momentos nos encontramos en el proceso de organizar un la-boratorio de actividades Córtico-Viscerales o Psicoanático en co-nexión con una Clínica Psiquiátrica. Otro Laboratorio de Psicofár-macos y Cardnota pero manteniendo el de Psicología Aplicada en el que yo continuaré con mis estudios de variables participantes en la relación Médico-Paciente en psicoterapia.

El Instituto ha organizado y convocado un Simposio Internacional de Neurofisiología el cual se celebró en febrero de 1955 en La Habana al cual asistieron muchos neurofisiólogos de fama internacional (como Aurastyán, Púrpura, Roy John, Grastyán, Bures, Kogan, Lifschitz, Listak, danoic, etc.) y está organizando un Simposio Internacional de Psicología para 1952 con el siguiente tema: "Motivación: sus aspec-tos psicológicos, sociales y neurofisiológicos. Perspectiva de su integración".

Hemos inaugurado una nueva sección llamada Estudio Transculturales la que trabaja en conexión con la Comisión Psiquiátrica Transcultu-ral de la Sociedad Cubana de Psiquiatría.

Para Junio yo empezaré a publicar una Revista que se llamará Psiquia-tría Transcultural y la cual será el órgano official de la Comisión de Psiquiatría: la Sección de Estudios Transculturales del Insti-tuto, en la que aparecerá un resumen y comentarios en español de todos los trabajos publicados sobre este materia en el mundo y más tarde incluirases nuestros propios trabajos.

En relación al Departamento de Psicología Médica de la Facultad de Medicina en la Universidad de La Habana, nosotros empezamos a traba-jar en 1961 después de operarse algunos cambios en la Universidad entre los cuales surgió este Departamento.

Empezamos con un curso práctico teórico en el 1er. año de Medicina pero mientras tanto se estaban realizando negociaciones con las autoridades Académicas para llevar a cabo una transformación.

Nuestra opinión es que la Psicología Médica debe enseñarse de modo paralelo a las disciplinas a lo largo de la carrera hasta que el absurdo dualismo que coy ofrece adecuada preparación somática pero muy débil preparación psicológica sea superado.

El año pasado, el Departamento de Psicología Médica realiza un estu-dio de la personalidad y vocación de todos los estudiantes que se inscriben haciendo entrevistas y pruebas que se repiten más tarde


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

Dr. .

En el 5to.

En el 2to. año explicaremos la Psicología General para dar la necesaria preparación a una aplicación adecuada de la Psicología Súico.

En el 3er. año invadimos el campo de la Propedéutica y participamos con los maestros añadiendo los factores psicológicos y sociales a la historia clínica, el estudio de los factores psicológicos en la entrevista, la relación Médico-Paciente, la reacción psicológica del paciente somático y las repercusiones somáticas de los trastornos emocionales.

En el 4to. año tenemos una tarea similar, pero como es natural, en una forma de especializada en Cirugía y Chatotrisia, y en el 5to. año en Pediatría, añadimos los elementos necesarios de Psicología Social para realizar una competente campaña sanitaria.

El 6to. año se dedica al sistema de internado rotativo.

El Departamento de Psiquiatría explica Propedéutica Psiquiátrica en 3ro. y 4to. años, y la Psiquiatría Clínica en el 5to.

Nuestro Departamento junto con el Departamento de Psiquiatría para los residentes de Psiquiatría explica los aspectos neurofisiológicos y psicológicos y en curso de post graduado dedica tres años a que se desarrollen como especialistas.

Un curso do Psicoterapia se está organizando para los post graduados para así crear patcoterapeutas.

Por el momento tenemos el siguiente personal, el cual es divide el trabajo entre eit 6 profesores, 4 auxiliares, 4 psicólogos. 3 instructores graduados, 6 no graduados y 40 estudiantes ayudantes.

Como que no tenemos técnicos suficientes ya que el nuestro es un país subdesarrollado, nosotros trabajamos en una doble capacidad por el momento (enseñanza e investigación) usando un tercio de nuestro tiempo en la enseñanza y cos tercios en la investigación.

Acabo de terminar un texto de Psicología Médica en tres tomos del cual ya salió el primero, el segundo está siendo impreso debiendo salir en los primeros meses del año en curso, y ya casi he terminado el 3ro.

Este es un trabajo sui generis ya que lo he escrito no solo como texto sino como trabajo de consulta. Un índice previo da todo el contenido y al programa del curriculum aparece al final. Todos los capítulos tienen los títulos en negritas; aquellos títulos que aparecen el proceso del curriculum son parte del curso, el resto son más que una expansión del mismo. De este modo, sirve igualmente a los estudiantes y a los médicos.

Creo que se trata de un trabajo que enfoca el problema de manera adecuada de acuerdo con nuestra tesis is lo que es la Psicología Médica


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

Yo llamo Esteniologia médica a mi libro. El primer tomo tiene 396 páginas, y cada uno de los otros dos tendrán un número similar de páginas.

El ler. tomo es sobre Psicología General (para los estudiantes del 2do. año y el 2do sobre se llama Psicología y la Medicina, y en la verdadera Psicología Médica la que es propia para los estudiantes de propedeútica en el ler. año, y también para aquellos que estén estudiando Cirugía, Obstetricia y Pediatría en el 4to. y 5to. años. El tercer tomo reune todas las escuelas psicológicas que se usan en Medicina así como toda la orientación de Psicoterapia que se usa para los post graduados.

Adjunto encontrará mi trabajo sobre "Aprendizaje y Drogas". Este trabajo que cabe de presentar en el XVIII Congreso Internacional de Psicología de Moscú en el Simposio de Psicofármacos y Regulación de la Conducta lo hemos continuaic posteriormente modificando el diseño realizacdo en lugar de tres sesiones un número de ellas que se extenderán heats unas veinte con idéntico ritmo. Con ello, pretendemos superar una duda que quedó consignada en sus conclusiones sobre la posible insuficiencia de tres sesiones en relación con la normal curva del olvido.

Muy bien podría ser este trabajo el que llevara al próximo Congreso de la CIP o por el contrario algunos de los que realizamos en el campo de la Psicología Transcultural.

También te satoy enviando "Pectores Culturales en Misterias con Cuadro Clínico Esquizofrénico". Este trabajo fue leído en el mes de Septiembre pasado en el IV Congreso Mundial de Psiquiatría, en Ksarid.

Además te ervio une copia del Indice del segundo temo. Yo considero que éste constituye una originalidad en todo el trabajo ya que el primer tomo es sobre Psicología General (de la cual hay trabajos publicados) el tercero contiene todas las escuelas (de las cuales hay trabajos publicados también). En Madrid, hube de cairar el Indice a Seguía y estuvo muy de acuerdo con el mismo. Te lo estoy enviando solicitando tu opinión crítica.

He escrito y se encuentro en el proceso de revisarlo y casi he tarminado un libro de uras 200 páginas para el cual ha seleccionado el follo de Palcologia Médica y su enseñenza en Medicine", un libro en el que expongo de manera detaileda mi opinión sobre esta materia, Come es natural, recoic en el mismo todas las opiniones expresadas por diferentes autores, también las orientaciones de

Dear Dr. Bustamante:

I have recently completed a reading of your paper entitled "Cultural Factors in Hysterias with Schizophrenic Clinical Pictures." I found it to be of great interest and I appreciate your sending it to me. I have been working with Dr. William Wolf on the projection of medical education and psychiatry as they are likely to be in the next century. The first of a series of articles and of a monograph, was published in the April 1966 issue of the American Journal of Psychotherapy. This takes in a great deal of analysis that would be included under transcultural psychiatry. Indeed, we are using the systems analysis approach which, of course, must take into account the broad psychosocial and socioeconomic forces that influence the psychodynamics matrices in individuals. I am interested in the particular securities that are precipitated in the ego structure of individuals by the very nature of the socioeconomic, sociopolitical and sociophilosophic system in which the individual lives. In an opposite vein, we are interested in the stresses that are placed upon the individual by various social systems from individual and practical standpoints. Awarenesses such as these should be of help in the planning of social systems for underdeveloped nations. While this seems like a very ambitious conceptualization, I do not believe that it is an unlikely possibility in the coming generations.

I look forward to receive the copy of your book "Psicologia Medica", Volume I. I believe that the outline as you presented it to me seems very inclusive.

Your note concerning a meeting dealing with

"motivation" to take place in February, 1958 is of some interest to me. I would like to know more about it with the possibility that I might attend if there are circumstances permitting my coming to Havana.

I plan to publish a modified form of your letter in the July issue of the American Journal of Psychotherapy. This will enable our readers to be more aware of your activities in Cuba.

I look forward to the maintenance of a very close correspondence.

Kindest regards.

# DISPATCH

Chief, WH Division

Chief of Station, JMWAVE JIG

Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT:
Dr. Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE

Reference: Director 83396

Action Required: For your information

1. Before leaving on his last trip to Cuba in March, he was asked to obtain information on Dr. Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE, reported to be one of Fidel CASTRO's physicians. He was warned that BUSTAMANTE is considered to be a pro-Soviet Communist.

2. had previously met Dr. BUSTAMANTE via a common friend, Dr. Guillermo DAVILA, a Mexican physician who occasionally gives L-1 messages and publications for delivery in Havana. DAVILA asked to say hello to his Cuban friend, which L-1 did on 27 March. During the ensuing conversation, BUSTAMANTE mentioned that he attended the World Congress of Psychology in the Soviet Union in August 1966. He had previously visited the USSR in 1961, and found great changes in that country. He felt that a definite evolution had taken place between 1961 and 1966, bringing life in the Soviet Union several steps closer to that in the Western countries. He also found radical changes in the field of his professional specialty. Psychiatric and psychological trends in the USSR, he felt, had broken away from the rigid doctrines that limited their development until a few years ago and had grown more liberal. Several specialists who had been ostracized for psychiatric and psychological theories contrary to those officially accepted in the USSR had been rehabilitated.

3. offered the services of his firm with branches in Mexico and Cuba to help BUSTAMANTE send and receive letters to and from foreign countries, pointing out that his firm quite frequently made use of Cubana pilots, a much faster transmittal method than normal mail channels.

BUSTANANTE appeared grateful for this offer and gave four letters when he had lunch with him on 30 April. Photocopies of these letters are forwarded under separate cover. We leave any exploitation of the information contained in these letters to Headquarters. / Of some interest is the fact that BUSTAMANIE hopes to attend a medical congress in Mexico in December 1967. Also interesting are the details which the doctor gives on his work In Cuba. BUSTAMANTE mentions, for example in his letter to Dr. Alfonso HILLAN in Mexico, that he is currently making two spparate investigationsi "Material and moral enducements for productivity" and "Motivation of a religious group in Cuba." A reply to one of BUSTANAUTE's letters received on 26 April is also attached under separate cover. Information provided by BUSTAMANTE on the rise and fall of Drs. MACHADO Ventura and Rene VALLEJO as Fidel Castro's private physicians and confidante was disseminated in a separate intelligence report.

2. This Station believes that an effort should made to obtain assessments of Dr. BUSTAMANTE from one or more American: doctors attending the Havana symposium and/or the Mexico City congress. While BUSTAMANIE Is openly critical of various aspects of United States foreign policy, including U.S. relations with Cuba, he apparently likes Americans. He recently told in Havana that the World Congress of Psychology held in Madrid in September 1966 gave him the opportunity to again weet, after a number of years, a number of colleagues from various countries including the United States. He said that he took this opportunity to deny allegations that he was a doctor belonging to the state security emphasizing that these allegations were calommies as he had always limited his activities in Cuba to strictly scientific fields.

3. We would like to have Headquarters' and JMWAVES' reactions to our suggestion.

Dear Dr. Redlich:

I: December 14, 1966, I wrote you a long letter giving you all the information about our activities at the Institute. I have not heard from you ever since, and I am afraid this letter did not reach you at all, therefore, I am enclosing a copy and following are a few more news about this year's activities so far.

I wish to let you know that in July our new Review called Transcultural Psychiatry will be published here. As soon as it is out, I will mail you a copy. We are editing it and it will be the first of its kind in our language.

We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute now, Dr. Antonio Santa Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning a Joint book on Transcultural Psychiatry since there is not a treatise in Spanish on this subject. I will let you know as to its development.

In reference to the Reviews that you so kindly offered to send us, we are for the time being overcoming the shortage we were experiencing. Instead, and if at all possible, I would like to receive Vol. III of the American Handbook of Psychiatry, edited by Silvano Arieti. I have Vols. I and II, and would be obliged to you if you could send it to me.

Although I know your interest is in Psychiatry, I wish to inform you that we are organizing a Symposium of Psychology which will take place in Havana, the 24-30 of November, 1966, convened by the Institute and the Academy of Sciences. Its subject will be: "Motivation: neurophysiologic, psychologic and social factors. Perspective of an integration". The paper could be on motivation: it can be an interdisciplinary subject, as well as neurophysiologic, psychologic or a social one.

I do not know whether you are interested or not, but in case you are, please let me know and I will send you an invitation. The guests' stay will be borne by the Academy of Sciences, and we have

made arrangements that will assure tickets for all via Mexico, Praga or Madrid.

Three of the scientists that have already accepted to come to the Symposium visited the Institute this year. One of them was Dr. Vladimir D. Nebylitsyn, Vice-Director of the Institute of Psychology from Moscow, who stayed two months with us. He helped us to create a typology laboratory in our Psychology Department. At the same time, he offered a course on typology variables according to Teplov and himself.

He works principally studying personality. His conception is primarily based in the human brain properties that were discovered by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and his collaborators.

De Nebylitsyn, as well as other investigators, have developed some scientific methods on the investigation of such properties of the nervous system and their studies nowadays can very well be correlated with certain personality dimensions. It has been thus proven by some investigatore abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to begin developing such scientific methods.

We also had Dr. E. Roy John, from the New York Medical College, who spent a month here. Following is a brief resumé of his activities at the Institute.

In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of learning, having memory as a basic theme, explained every possible way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and anatomically. The lecture was discussed by those attending, and experimental solutions were proposed for various problems not yet resolved. The text book used in this course was written by Dr. John himself and will be out of print by now.

In the afternoons, four different experiments were carried out. The first one on egoked potentials in humans, correlations of same facing luminous stimulations of different colors. Influence of expectancy situations. The second experiment was on learning, observing cats with alimentary reflex. The third one was in influence of specific and unspecific structures of the Central Nervous System on learning. Stimulations of different specific structures and of reticular watching the importance of the facilitation of this mechanism. The fourth experiment was a study with microelectrodes of neuronal activity changes during the learning stage in cronic animals.

Both Dr. Nebylitsyn and Dr. John dictated very interesting

conferences at the Academy of Sciences' Conference Hall and at the Scientific Council of the Ministry of Public Health.

At the moment, we have Dr. E. Grastyán, from the University of Pecs, Hungary, who will leave soon after collaborating with the Department of Psychology for two months. He has been working on motivation and cooperating in a joint work for our coming Symposium.

I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. D. Leigh, Secretary to the World Psychiatric Association and among other things I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section of Transcultural Psychiatry within the World Psychiatric Association because this is a rather new and multi-disciplinary field (comprising psychologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists, etc.) requiring more than any other one the cooperation and help to facilitate the efforts to keep producing and offering contributions in the development of this field.

I have secured a better way to get our mail and it consists of the following: address your envelope to Laboratorios Erba, Apartado 21909, Mexico 21, D.F., Mexico, and the letter to me. Once they open the letter and see it is addressed to me, a member of the laboratory will bring it personally to me as they travel back and forth between our countries. I will address my letters to you and they will mail them in Mexico to you. In this way, we are both sure our mail will not get lost since I have absolute confidence in them.

I think I have covered everything of interest to you.

Hoping to hear from you soon, and with best wishes, I remain,

Cordially yours,

Dear Dr. Redlich:

According to our conversation I am writing to you in order to let you know all about the Institute of Neurophysiology and Psychology of the Academy of Sciences of Cuba, and the Department of Medical Psychology of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Havana.

Our Institute, which began its activities in 1962, has three Departments: Neurophysiology, Psychology and Social Psychology, and was founded by the School of Medicine, becoming one of the Institutes of the Academy of Sciences in 1965.

The Department of Neurophysiology is working on the following investigations: *

a) Influences of some drugs or chemical substances which favor and inhibit Leao's spreading depression on convulsive crisis.
b) Cardiotonic influences on avoidance reflex.
c) Study on the electrical activity of Zachrisia coanensis' nervous system.
d) Drug-dependence learning on cat and rat.

The Psychology Department is working on these investigations: *

a) Study on the participant variables in the Physician-Patient relationship in individual psychotherapy and in group psychotherapy.
b) Hand-steediness and Motivation.
c) Personality factors of the physician in Iatrogenic disturbances.
d) Motivation and motor activity.
e) Hypnosis and learning.

The Department of Social Psychology is doing the next researches: *

a) Attitude survey on medical school students.
b) Social Maladjusted behavior in Camagüey Province.
c) Study on bureaucracy.

* At the time this was written.

The Secial Psychology Department is not a laboratory on Social Sciences; it is not a Sesiology Department, and if you will, it is net ruled by a Paychelogised concept of Sociology.

It is a laboratory where modest social aspects of our medium are stdied with the purpose to know the values and stereotypes offered in Gur mediva in ceansetion with the psychological activity.

Thus, the investigations to study the attitudes and opinions of the yeung Cuban stricate as wellas the study of the ambitione of the man in the fields, is his awa lands or in collective farms, are carried out in this Secial Psychology Department.

For the first time in Cuba we have this opportunity since our Hetica is, at last, a big cecial Laboratory where profound changes are being offered to the investigative mind, great possibilities that if not taken in consideration would be hopelessly lest.

As it can be cheerved, the social study is limited to these peonilar spests not ealy of our tradition but of the changes securring in cur country, as well as the consequent psychological medifications that will be evidenced in car Sympesia.

Besides the thros Departments, the Institute has four Sest1028: Electronics, Statistics, Billegraphy and Publications.

At this moment, the personnel working at the Institute is as follower & Professors, 6 auxiliarice, 3 psychologists, 6 technicians, 2 statisticians, 1 anthropologist, 6 students in Jeurophysiology, 6 in Psychology, and 6 in Secial Psychology.

As a final aspiration, there is the possible unification of the efforts carried out by our three Departments so we can reach our goal, 1.0., the inter-disciplinary studies made in fields unknown up to now, an aspiration maintained by those interested in these subjects. Thus, we are eawking in two lines of investigation: "Material and moral incentives in productivity", and "Motivation in a Cuban religious group".

To sum it in, the objective of our Institute is the study of the neurophysiolegis and psychological levels as well as that of the social aspects that might be of interest in our country, trying within the LiSH of car methods of investigations to attain the inter-disciplinary integration of these disciplines.

We are now in the preseas of organising a Cortico-Visceral Activi- ties er Paychosomatic Laboratory in connection with a Poychiatric Clinis. Another Laboratory on Payshepharescala and Behavior keeping the Applied Peychology one in which I will continue with my studies of participant variables in the Physician-Patient relationship in Psychotherapy. In

As of this date, June, 1967, the latter was dropped.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 77

Dr. F. C. Redlich

reference to this last work, I wish to state that I have finished the first stage.

The Institute has organised and convened an International Neurophysiology Symposium which took place in February, 1965, in Havana which was attended by many Neurophysiologists of international fume (like Asratyán, Purpura, Rey John, Grastyán, Bures, Kagan, Lifschits, Lissak, Hancia, etc.) and is organising an International Psychology Symposium for February, 1968 with the following theme: "Motivation: its neurophysiological, psychological and social aspects. Perspective of its Integration".

We have inaugurated a new section called Transcultural Studies which works in connection with the Transcultural Psychiatric Commission of the Cuban Society of Psychiatry.

For the beginning of next year I will begin to publish a Review called Transcultural Psychiatry and which will be the official organ of the Transcultural Psychiatry Commission of the Cuban Society of Psychiatry and the Transcultural Studies Section of the Institute, where we will have a resumé and comments in Spanish of all the papers published in this subject in the world and later on we will include our own works.

Enclosed please find my paper on "Learning and Drugs" which I read at the XVIII International Congress of Psychology in Moscow, and the one you heard at the IV World Congress of Psychiatry, in Madrid, "Cultural Factors in Hysterias with Schizophrenic Clinical Picture", and also one of our Bulletins. I will send you the next number now in press.

In relation to the Department of Medical Psychology of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Havana, we started to work in 1961 after making some changes at the University which, among other things, created this Department.

We began with a theoretic practical course in the 3rd year of Medicine but we undertook all the opportune negotiations with the academic authorities to carry out such a transformation.

Our opinion is that Medical Psychology must be taught in parallel manner to the disciplines all along the career until the absurd dualism that today offers adequate somatic preparation but very weak psychological preparation is overcome.

Last year in agreement with the Faculty and after constant efforts we obtained and put in practice the following activity:

In the 1st. year, our Department carries out a study of the personality and inclinations of all the students who are registered making interviews and tests which are repeated later in the 5th year.

The date of the Symposium has been moved to 24-30 of November, 1968.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

Dr. G. Redlich

In the 2nd. year, we explain General Psychology in order to give the necessary preparation for an adequate application of Medical Psychology.

In the 3rd. year, we invade the field of Propedeutics and participate with these teachers adding the psychological and social factors in the clinical hystory, the study of Payeholegical factors in the interview, the physician-patient relationship, the psychological reaction of the somatie patient and the sometic repercussions of the emotional disturbances.

In the 4th year, we realise a similar task, but as it is natural, in a mere specialised manner in Surgery and Obstetrics, and in 5th year in Pediatrics, adding the necessary Social Psychology elemente in Pre- ventive Medicine to carry out a competent sanitary campaign.

The sixth year is dedicated to the rotating internship eyeten.

Fire Department of Peychiatry explains Payehiatrie Propedeuties in Jrd. and 4th years, and Clinical Psychiatry in Sth.

Our Departrent tegether with the Psychiatrie Department fer residante in Payahistory explains the Heurophysiologic and Paychelegical aspects and in the post-graduate term dedicates three years for them te besme specialista.

A course on Peychotherapy is being organised for the post-graduates lean to create psychotherapeutists.

At the present we have the following staff which divides the werk anang theselves:

*   6 Professors
*   4 auxiliaries
*   4 Paycholsgiste
*   3 graduated instruetera
*   6. weder-graduated instructors and
*   40 student-helpers

As we do not have many technicians sinse sure is an underdeveloped country, we have to wark in a dual capacity fer the mostat (tegching and investigating) wing a third of our time in teaching and two thira fa investigation.

I just finished a tort on Medical Pevahela tel which the first is already out, the second is in press, cemming out during the first months of the coming year, and I am almost finished with the third.

This is a "sui-generis" work as I have written it both as a text and as a work of consultation. A previous index gives all the contents and the curriculum program appears at the end. All chapters have all the headings in blacker types these headings that appear in the curriculum

program are part of the course, the rost are merely an expansion of the same. This way, it fits both the students and the physicians.

I think it is a work that approaches the problem in an adequate manner according to our thesis of what Medical Psychology is and this is why I am writing to you became after revising all the world bibliography on this subject I verified that the Medical Psychology works already published are nothing but General Psychology or Handbooks of Psychosomatic Pathology.

I call it Medical Psychology. The first volume, just out, has 396 pages, and each of the other two volumes will have similar number of pages.

The first volume is about General Psychology (for the students in the 2nd year) and the second volume is called Psychology and Medicine and it is the true Medical Psychology which is suitable for the students of Pre-podiatrics in the 3rd year, and also for those taking Surgery, Obstetrics and Pediatrics in the 4th and 5th years. The third volume gathers all Psychological schools being used in Medicine as well as all the orientations in Psychotherapy which are in use for the post-graduates.

Also enclosed please find the Index of the second volume. I consider this one constitutes an originality in the whole work since the first volume is a General Psychology (of which there are published works) and the third one contains all the schools (of which there are published works too).

In Madrid, I showed Seguin the program of the second book and he was greatly in favor of it. I am sending it to you asking for your critical opinion.

I had written, now in the process of revising and almost finished, a book of about 200 pages for which I have chosen the title of "Medical Psychology and its teaching in Medicine", a book in which I compose in detail my opinion about this matter. As it is understandable, I gather in it the opinions expressed by different authors, Congresses and Conferences' orientations, what is available in the world on this subject at this moment, and after all that I develop what we are doing in our Medical Psychology Department and, finally, our opinion about all this.

When this book is out of print, I will send you one copy.

Dr. Redlich, we have some knowledge of your Psychiatric Department and your investigations but we would like to know more in detail about them. Would you please correspond with a similar letter telling me the most important information of your activities.

As for the Reviews we are interested in, I want you to know that at the moment we are conducting a survey in our Library to see what we have and what we need, and for the first days of the next year I will let you know about this.

Querido Amigo:

Aprovechando un nuevo viaje del amigo Varisco te escribo otra vez para
saludarte y darte unos informes que creó de importancia.

También le estoy escribiendo a Seguín y Dávila. Les hago saber a todos
que en el mes de Julio saldrá el primer número de nuestra Revista Psi-
quistría Transcultural de la cual les enviaré un ejemplar tan pronto
salga.

En el mes de Noviembre se ha de celebrar una reunión de la Organiza-
ción Sanitaria Panamericana sobre la "Enseñanza de la Psicología Médi-
ca y la Psiquiatria en América," a la que pienso asistir pues ha sido
invitada la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de la Habana por la
organización y la Facultad casi con toda seguridad me ha de designar,
en ese caso no tendría problemas pues ellos se ocupan de conseguir la
visa y de todos los demás detalles relacionados con la reunión.

En el mes de Enero le escribí una extensa carta a Pichot que en el
Congreso de Madrid estuvo tratando de producir una reunión de los
asistentes al mismo que se dedican a la Psicología Médica.

Yo recibí su citación con gran entusiasmo pues creo que es necesario
cambien impresiones los norteamericanos, europeos y latinoamericanos
ya que cada uno de dicho grupo tenemos nuestra propia opinión como
son sin duda las tres opiniones que rigen en el mundo en esta materia.
El por su parte nos defraudó tanto a mi como a Seguin pues realizó
una reunión intrascendente y se puso en contacto con gente que no re-
presente la Psicologia Médica en el mundo y por ejemplo, concretamen-
te en relación al Perú, entró en contacto, no con Seguín que estaba
allí, sino con un muchacho que no se dedica a esta disciplina.

Esa es la razón por la cual le escribí esa carta haciéndole esas crí-
ticas y sugiriéndole que para tratar de esos problemas con nosotros
latinoamericanos tenían fundamentalmente que entrar en contacto con-
tigo, con Seguín y conmigo pues creo fuera de toda falsa modestia que
somos la más alta experiencia de la Psicología Médica en América Lati-

na y de hecho una corriente de importancia en el mundo.

No he tenido respuesta a esta carta todavía, pero si recibí una nota de él donde me decía que había estado varios meses fuera de Francia.

Ahora bien yo creo que lo mejor es que cambiemos impresiones los tres por correo antes de llegar a la reunión en Noviembre en Lima pues allí nos vamos a poner de acuerdo los latinoamericanos sobre dicho problema. Seguín estara allí, tú no debes faltar y yo voy a hacer todo lo posible por ir.

Claro que hay cátedras de Psicología Médica en Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia y tal vez otras más, pero el desarrollo que hemos logrado en Perú, México y Cuba por nuestros respectivos esfuerzos todo el mundo reconoce y de no sabarlo lo acepta en cuanto se le informa.

Por ello es que creo que es importante que cambiemos impresiones los tres antes de llegar a Noviembre, para llegar a Lima con perspectivae de una línea adecuada.

Luego debemos demandar de los norteamericanos y de Pichot y los Europsos un cambio de impresiones o indicárselo a la OMS como acuerdo de nuestra reunión en Lima.

Con los mejores deseos para ti y un fuerte abrazo, se despide tu amigo,

Querido Amigo y Compañero:

Aprovechando la oportunidad que me brinda los Laboratorios Erba de escribir a los amigos de Latino América a través de ellos es que te hago estas líneas. A partir de ahora dirige el sobre a ellos a la dirección siguiente: Apartado 21909, Mexico 21, D.F., Mexico, y la carta a mí. Una vez que ellos abren el sobre y ven que está dirigida a mí, me la trae personalmente un representante de la casa en sus viajes entre nuestro país y Mexico. Así podemos estar seguros de una vía que no crea problemas pues tú escribes a Mexico y te llegan las mías de Mexico. Gracias a esto es que te estoy enviando el Tomo I de mi libro "Psicología Médica".

Te hago saber que en el mes de Julio saldrá el primer número de nuestra Revista Psiquiatría Transcultural de la cual te enviaré un ejemplar por la misma vía.

Te estoy enviando un ejemplar de los trabajos que a continuación relaciono: "Aprendizaje y Drogas", trabajo que leí en el Simposio "Psicofarmacología y Regulación de la Conducta" en el XVIII Congreso Internacional de Psicología, Moscú; el trabajo que oiste en Madrid, "Factores Culturales con Cuadro Clínico Esquizofrénico"; "Importancia de la Psicología Médica en la Formación del Nuevo Médico", trabajo que ha sido traducido al Alemán y será publicado por la Universidad de Halle-Mittemberg, Alemania; "La Enseñanza de la Psicología Médica en Cuba", que ha sido traducido al Búlgaro y será publicado en la Revista "Savremena Medicina" en Sofía, Bulgaria; así como el último número del Boletín del Instituto. El Boletín a partir del próximo número saldrá cada tres meses, y estando ya en imprenta el número de Julio tan pronto salga te enviaré un ejemplar.

Deseo hacerte saber que le envié a Stanley Lesse mi trabajo "Psiquiatría en Cuba", igual al que tu enviaste correspondiente al Perú, el cual debe estar al salir en el American Journal of Psychotherapy.

Está al salir también mi libro "Le Enseñanza de la Psicología Médica en la Carrera de Medicina". Recibirás un ejemplar cuando esté listo. Asimismo, recordarás haber visto el Indice del Tomo II de la "Psicolo-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 84

"gia Médica" el cual saldrá el mes de julio próximo y del cual también te
enviare un ejemplar.

Voy a México en Diciembre de este año, al Congreso de la Sociedad Inter-
americana de Psicologia y espero verte alli. Es casi seguro que vaya
también, a fines de Noviembre a Lima, a la reunión de le Crganización
Sanitaria Panamericana sobre la "Enseñanza de la Psicologia Médica y la
Psiquiatría en América". He side invitado por la organización y ellos
se encargan de conseguirme la visa y demás detalles relacionados con el
viaje. Es casi seguro que vaya.

Estoy usando la misma vía para comunicarme con Dávila, y le envié un
retrabo mio así como el trabajo que llevé a Madrid. El retrato saldrá
en la Revista de la Asociación con un comentario similar al que se hizo
sobre González Enríquez y sobre tí, y el trabajo lo publicarán en este
o el próximo número.

En mi carta del mes de febrero te informaba sobre mi carta a Pichot.

Yo creo que lo mejor es esperar a la reunión de Noviembre en Lima pues
alli nos vamos a poner de acuerdo los latinoamericanos sobre el proble-
ma. Tú estarás presente, Millán irá con toda seguridad y yo voy a ha-
cer todo lo posible por ir. Además creo que tú, Millán y yo, fuera de
toda falsa modestia, somos la más alta experiencia de ls Psicología Mé-
dica en América Latine y de hecho, como señalo en mis trabajos y en el
libro que te reseño, una corriente de importancia en el mundo.

Claro que hay cátedras de Psicología Médica en Argentina, Venezuela,
Colombia y tal vez otras más, pero el desarrollo que hemos logrado en
Perú, México y Cuba por nuestros respectivos esfuerzos todo el mundo
reconoce y de no saberlo lo acepta en cuanto se le informa.

Por ello es que creo que es importante que cambiemos impresiones los
tres, antes de llegar a Noviembre.

Esta vía que ahora poseemos y que se debe a una gran amistad del Sr.
Varisco, Representante de la casa Erba de Milán en México y en Cuba,
con Dávila y ahora conmigo lo garantiza, ya que él personalmente vis-
ja Cuba-México todos los meses. El me dice que sin pena alguna pode-
mos escribirnos y enviarnos lo que deseemos y como siempre antes y
ahors hemos mantenido correspondencia ajena a todo problema político
y nos interesamos en los problemas científicos cuya responsabilidad nos
incumbe puedes pues escribirme y enviarme folletos, libros, todo lo
que desees y yo igual a ti pues el Sr. Varisco es el que lo recibe y
quien me lo envía a mí o a tí. Tu recibes correspondencia de México,
no de Cuba, y escribes a México. Por tal razón espero que ahora nues
tra correspondencia se restablezca.

No solo lo usarás tú sino los amigos (6 u 8) de América Latina y tam-
bién un grupo de norteamericanos que ya me estan escribiendo.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 85

Pues bien, debemos escribirnos los tres (lo estoy haciendo también a Millán) para llegar a Lima con perspectivas de una línea adecuada.

Luego debemos demandar de los norteamericanos y de Pichot y los Europeos un cambio de impresiones o indicárselo a la OMS como acuerdo de nuestra reunión en Lims.

Espero de todos modos la respuesta de Pichot, pues estuvo fuera de París y ahora recibi nota de él.

Por otra parte, creo que nosotros tres (tú, Dávila y yo) tenemos la responsabilidad de llevar adelante la comisión de Estudios Transculturales de la Asociación Psiquiátrica de la América Latina en unión de Kelly y Marconi.

Voy a confeccionar un proyecto de actividades y se lo voy a enviar a Dávila y a tí te enviaré una copia.

De todos modos le escribí a Leigh, el Secretario de la Asociación Handial de Psiquiatría pidiéndole se creare una Comisión o sección de Psiquiatria Transcultural en la Asociación Mundial de Psiquiatría.

Espero que ahora me podrás escribir sin problemas e infórmame de tus actividades.

Deseando te encuentres bien al recibo de ésta y en espera de tus noticia, y con un abrazo se despide tu amigo,

P.D. En mi última carta con fecha 17 de febrero envié los dos primeros trabajos de los señalados en la página 1, como no he recicido respuesta alguna pienso que no llegaron a tus manos, y por eso los envío de nuevo.

Stanley Lesse, (M.D.)
American Journal of Psychotherapy
15 West 81st Street
New York, N.Y.

Dear Dr. Lesse:

I have received your letter of April 21 for which I thank you.

As of now I am inviting you in the name of the Institute and the Academy of Sciences of Cuba to our next International Symposium of Psychology which will take place on 24-30 of November in 1968.

So far we have received acceptance letters from the following scientists: two from Italy, Dr. Ancona and Dr. Marzi; one from Hungary, Dr. Grastyán; one from the G.D.R., Dr. Hiebsch; one from Belgium, Dr. Nuttin, one from Checoslovaquia, Dr. Buresova; one from France, Dr. Gastaut; four so far from your country, Doctors Roy John, Littig, Mansonn and Klausner; we also have four from the Soviet Union at this moment, Doctors Roitbak, Zotowa, Oshanin and Hebylitsyn.

The guests' stay will be borne by the Academy of Sciences, and we have made arrangements to cover your trip Mexico-Havana-Mexico. Unfortunately, we won't be able to pay for the New York-Mexico trip due to the dollar situation, something I regret very much.

If you can arrange to be with us then I wish you would send me the title of your work. The Symposium will accept papers in three languages, English, French and Spanish. Your work could be on motivation in psychotherapy, or any other subject you may have in mind as long as it deals with motivation. It can either be a neurophysiologic, social or a psychological theme. Once your paper has been accepted, it should be in our hands by May 31, 1968, and its length should be about 30 minutes. After your paper has been reed, there will be a discussion on your work by all concerned. As you can see, you have a year from the moment this Symposium is convened up to the time of presentation of your paper which we believe is sufficient.

It would give me a great pleasure if you could come a week earlier or stayed a week after the Symposium to give a course at the Institute, or a month if it is possible. The Academy will take care of the expenses.

We would appreciate an early answer from you about this so we can begin the necessary arrangements.

As for your information about publishing a version of my letter to you on activities at the Institute is all right with me. In fact, I consider it a great honor to tell your readers about us.

I am happy to know that you have received and read my paper on *Cultural Factors in Hysterias with Schizophrenic Clinical Pictures.*
For my part, I will let you know that I have read your monography published in the April 1966 number of the American Journal of Psychotherapy. I found it extremely interesting and was glad to know that there is more to come on this subject.

Thank you for your kind words about my book on Medical Psychology. The one you received is Vol. I; Vol. II will be out in August, and I am working on Vol. III. As soon as Vol. II is out, I will mail you a copy.

Three of the scientists that have already accepted to come to the Symposium visited the Institute this year. One of them was Dr. Vladimir D. Nebyliteyn, Vice-Director of the Institute of Psychology from Moscow, who stayed two months with us. He helped us to create a typology laboratory in our Psychology Department. At the same time he offered a course on topology variables according to Teplov and himself.

He works principally studying personality. His conception is primarily based in the human brain properties that were discovered by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and his collaborators.

Dr. Nebylitsyn, as well as other investigatore, have developed some scientific methods on the investigation of such properties of the nervous system and their studies nowadays can very well be correlated with certain personality dimensions. It has been thus proven by some investigators abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to begin developing such scientific methods.

We also had Dr. B. Roy John, from the New York Medical College, who spent a month here. Following is a brief resumé of his activities at the Institute.

In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of learning, having memory as a basic theme, explained every possible way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and anatomically. The lecture was discussed by those attending, and experimental solutions were proposed for various problems not yet resolved. The text book used in this course was written by Dr. John himself and will be out of print by now.

In the afternoons, four different experiments were carried out. The first one on evoked potentials in humans, correlations of game facing luminous stimulations of different colors. Influence of expectancy situations. The second experiment was on learning, observing cate with alimentary reflex. The third one was in influence of specific and unspecific structures of the Central Nervous System on learning. Stimulations of differest specific structures and of reticular watching the importance of the facilitation of this mechanism. The fourth experiment was a study with microelectrodes of neuronal activity changes during the learning stage in cronic animals.

Both Dr. Febylitsyn and Dr. John dictated very interesting conferences at the Academy of Sciences' Conference Hall and at the Scientific Council of the Ministry of Public Health.

At the moment, we have Dr. E. Grastyan, from the University of Poes, Hungary, who will leave soon after collaborating with the Department of Psychology for two months. He has been working on motivation and cooperating in a joint work for our coming Symposium.

I told you in my previous letter that I was receiving your Journal because the dues had been paid, but I just found out that because of the dollar situation my subscription was not renewed, something I an unable to help. If at all possible I would like you to do the following:

We are publishing a Bulletin for the Institute, and as of next July, the first number of a Review called Transcultural Psychiatry, the first of its kind in Spanish, will be out. I beg of you that, apart from sending you news about Cuba from time to time to be published in your Journal, to please accept as an exchange these two Reviews for your Journal, otherwise, I could not guarantee to receive it periodically. Thus, I am proposing an official exchange of both Reviews until this abnormal situation can be remedied, because the Journal is very important to me.

Please refer to my letter of March 27 as to the fastest way of communication between us. This will reach you via the same person. However, please address the Journal to the Institute address: Loma y 37, Alturas del Vedado, Havana, Cuba.

I will be waiting for your news. With best wishes, I am,

(JAB/el

Dear Dr. Kiev:

I received yours of May 17 a few days ago and I thank you for the information.

First of all, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your book, *"Magic, Faith and Healing - Studies in Primitive Psychiatry Today"*, for which I am grateful. It is most interesting and I am reading it with great pleasure.

I want you to know that in July a new Review called *Transcultural Peychiatry* will be published here. We are editing it and it will be the first of its kind in our language. As soon as it is out, I will mail you a copy. This Review will be the official organ of the Transcultural Psychiatry Commission of the Cuban Society of Psychiatry and the Cuban Group of Transcultural Studies in which a resumé, translation or comments in Spanish of all the works written the world over will be published. Later on, it will become the publication media for the Cuban Society of Psychiatry works, as well as those written by the Trans-cultural Psychiatry Section of the Institute, gathering in it all Cuban publications and giving opportunity too to some Latin American scientists' papers, but always keeping comments, translation or resumé of other Reviews. At the beginning, the Review will appear every 6 months, but later on it will be a quarterly.

We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute now, Dr. Antonio Santa Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning a joint book on Transcultural Psychiatry, since there is not a treatise in Spanish on this subject that I know of. I will let you know as to its development.

Just today I received the 1966 Report on Activities of the International Committee Against Mental Illness, also, I got the picture taken during the luncheon in Madrid, for which I thank you.

Reading the Report I noticed there is a Bulletin de Centre de Psychiatrie et de Neurologie in Haiti. I would like to receive copy or copies of numbers that have already appeared. I do not know exactly where to write, or to whom address the letter, so will you kindly take care of this for me.

Also, I am interested in the International Journal of Psychiatry published in Boston, which I would like to receive too. You could give them my name with the Institute address so they can send me the copies. To both these Reviews you can tell them that since I am Director of both the bulletin of the Institute and the new Review of Transcultural Psychiatry I am officially proposing an exchange for their Review, or else they can tell me what they want me to do.

Incidentally, I wish to call your attention to the fact that the Institute's name now is Instituto de Neurofisiología y Psicología, not Instituto de Investigaziones de la Actividad Nerviosa Superior, as the aforementioned Report was addressed. The address was correct, Loma y 37, Alturas del Vedado, Havana, Cuba.

I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. D. Leigh, Secretary to the World Psychiatric Association and among other things I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section of Trans-cultural Psychiatry within the World Psychiatric Association because this is a rather new and multi-disciplinary field (comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, anthropologists, etc.) requiring more than any other one the cooperation and help to facilitate the efforts to keep producing and offering contributions in the development of this field.

I have secured a better way to get our mail and it consists of the following: address your envelope to Laboratorios Erba, Apartado 21909, Mexico 21, D.F., Mexico, and the letter to me. Once they open the letter and see it is addressed to me, a member of the laboratory will bring it personally to me as they travel back and forth between our countries. I will address my letters to you and they will mail them in Mexico to you. In this way, we are both sure our mail will not get lost since I have absolute confidence in them.

I am taking this opportunity to send you my book, *Medical Psycho-logy*, in three volumes of which this is Vol. I.

I think I have covered everything of interest to you.

Hoping to hear from you soon, and with best wishes, I am,

Cordially yours

Querido Compañero:

Aprovechando un nuevo viaje del amigo Varisco le escribo otra vez para saludarlo y darle una pequeña información, pero primeramente deseo que al recibo de esta se encuentre Ud. bien de salud.

También le estoy escribiendo a Seguín y Millán, Les hago saber a todos que en el mes de Julio saldra el primer número de nuestra Revista Psiquiatría Transcultural de la cual les enviaré un ejemplar tan pronto salga.

Yo creo que nosotros tres, (Seguin, Ud. y yo) tenemos la responsebilidad de llevar adelante la Comisión de Estudios Transculturales de la Asociación Psiquiátrica de la América Latina en unión de Kelly y Marconi.

Meditando sobre este asunto he pensado que sería bueno escribir un proyecto de actividades y se lo enviaré para que Ud. lo estudie y me dé su opinión. Le escribiré a Seguín dándole un esquema del mismo.

De todos modos, deseg informarle que le escribi a leigh, el Secretario de la Asociación Mundial de Psiquiatria pidiéndole se creara una comisión o sección de Psiquiatría Transcultural dentro de la misma Asociación.

Sin más por el momento, y con un afectuoso saludo quedo de Ud.,

Message 107. Dear John. I received your 96.

I have known Doctor Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE O'Leary since student days. He vas always conspicuous in the assemblies of those days as bdonging to the leftist sector. He graduated as a medical doctor in 1939. Since then he virtually lived in the medical school of Havana and in the National (Medical School] together with Doctor Jose LOPEZ Sanchez (at present Secretay of the Academy of Sciences, intelligent Communist and very dangerous). They set to work to obtain positions in the Medical Commissions and representing the Medical College every time there was a chance to go abroad. This brought about a certain protest from the doctors who contributed to the funds of the college and who met the costs of the trips, because the same ones (Drs. BUSTAMANTE and LOPEZ Sanchez) went every tine even when the reasons for the trip had nothing to do with their medical specialities. This brought about the regulation of futue trips, but by that time EUSTAMANTE and LOPEZ Sanchez had made their contacts and had founded the Pan American Medical Confederation (C.M.P.) with headquarters in Havana. This confederation was made up of the National Medical Associations rpt National


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

SECRET
-5-

Modical Associations, that is to say, the Pan American Medical Colleges, among these the Cuban Medical College. They then occupied positions in the Central Executive Committee. Later there were established four zones of the C.H.P. with BUSTALANTE occupying the position of president and Dr. LOPEZ Sanchez the office of treasurer, leaving the secretariat open on a rotating basis for an executive of the National Medical College who might be useful to them in their manipulations. Thus in September of 1955 they managed to have the National Hedical College sponsor the publication of the C.N.P. They maintained themselves in their respective offices up to the present year, alternating the secretary whenever the executive committce of the National Medical College was changed. The periodical of the C.M.P. was published until the dissolution of the National Medical College. When the Revolutionary Medical College was founded they were able to install as secretary of the C.M.P. for the Caribbean Zone Dr. Leopoldo E. ARAUJO Pernal who is manipulated by BUSTAMANTE as a puppet to serve his ends. When it was learned that a movement was afoot in the Executive Central Committee of the C.N.P. to expell Cuba-this being pushed by the medical associations of the other latin American Republics BUSTAMANTE advised the government to dissolve the Cuban Medical Association, using Dr. ARAUJO as President P.S. (sic.) of the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 115

SECRET

Medical College. In this way they brought about a resignation from the C.M.P. [by dissolving their organization] thus avoiding the possibility of the C.H.P. voting for expulsion rpt expulsion since the Cuban Medical College had officially ceased to exit. The dissolution took place on 30 April of last year [1965]. His specialties were, one; Psychiatry with offices at K Street #309. This is also the specialty of Dr. ARAUJO, two; now Professor of Nervous and Mental Disorders at the University of Havana. He has Dr. ARAUJO as professorial assistant, three; Director of the Institute of Psychiatry, another bureaucratic institute in which his protege Dr. ARAUJO also has a position, four; he does not like publicity, serving behind the scenes as advisor to those who appear in public, five; he does not help anyone disinterestedly but neither does he hurt anyone, six; he always has, and up to the present, lived well during all of the administrations of the Medical College and through the various governments. For this reason he is called the "man of cork" because he always remains afloat. Public opinion holds that he supplies drugs to the G-2 to make the prisoners talk and that he is director of all this type of work, but I have been unable to confirm this personally. I will continue this topic in my next message because I am afraid that another sheet of paper will be too bulky for one letter.
Felicitations. Mosa, end.

Message 108. Esteemed Juan. Your message 9 /_Believed:_
to be 967 was the last message I received this year of 1966.
Your instructions completely rpt completely understood. To date
I have not rpt not received a letter from A55e6
dated 30 November, nor "Notas" for July-August.

Continuation of report on Doctor Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE.

7. I do not believe that he is personal physician to CASTRO,
   because his specialty is psychiatry, but I do /_believe_ that he
   is used by CASTRO since he is intelligent and is well connected

because of his previous peace activities, and because he has not been a part of any revolutionary action group. The doctor and spiritual guide who constantly accompanies CASTRO is Doctor VALLEJO /Dr. Rene VALLEJO Ortiz7. With BUSTAMANTE, LOPEZ Sanchez /Dr. Jose LOPEZ Sanchez and ARAUJO /Dr. Leopoldo E. ARAUJO Bernal7 as well, there collaborates Doctor Armando de CORDOVA /Dr. Armando de CORDOVA y de Castro7, high official of the Ministry of Public Health. I do not know the contacts of Doctor BUSTAMANTE abroad but I assume that ti are many because for more than five years he dedicated himself with the influence and financial support of the modical college /National Medical College to establishing relations all over the world, attending congresses and meetings as a member of the various commissions, but as I reported previously, /in SW #1077 without publicity and working and directing covertly the /activities7 of his ad hoc puppets.

Other subject. I have been summoned by the Director of the Graphic Arts Enterprise for a study in all of the island in relation with my profession rpt profession. They have cited me for an interview next month. I will inform you in due time on the details. It is desirable that you continue your transmissions on Saturdays and the repeats on Thursdays since letters take a long time in arriving at their destinations and it is possible that I might have to go into the interior midweek without your having received news from me and that I would not rpt not be able to copy your message. I will try to be in Havana on Saturdays. Regards. End.

FYI

1. This report was prepared by a member of a group of Cuban emigres who have been trained in the techniques of information collection and who have provided useful reports since early 1962, from CC-3138, Jorge Julio BEATO Nuñez, M.D., Pediatrician, a Cuban refugee and former resident of Hayana City who left Cuba on 30 April 1967.

2. In February or March 1967, Beato sent (Dr) Augusto *FERNANDEZ-Conde, employed at Florida State Hospital, Chattahoochee Florida, U.S.A. a copy of the magazine Tribuna Medica (Medical Tribune), which contains a complete list of all the "professionals" (presumably medical doctors) remaining in Cuba and all those who have left Cuba. Dr. Fernandez acknowledged receipt of the magazine Dr. Fernandez was the last President of the National Medical College of Cuba, dissolved by Fidel Castro in April 1966.

3. In January or February 1967, Beato learned from medical files, the complete list of all the Cuban medical doctors who had taken the Foreign Board examinations in Florida, U.S.A., together with the grades received. This also "appeared in the School of Medicine, Havana University". The examinations are highly confidential and it is inexplicable how such private information could be published in Cuba. Medical doctors in Cuba presume that "said organization must be infiltrated by Communists" who pirated the information and forwarded it to Cuba.

4. (Dr) Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE Oleares directs a psychological center for superior studies the location of which was not known to Beato. It is believed to be a training school in methods of exploring the subconcious mind used by the Departamento de Seguridad del Estado (DSE, Department of State Security).

Pero he podido enviar por correo al Dr. Augusto FER-HANDEZ Conde el último Presidente del Colegio Médico Nacional, un ejemplar de la revista Tribuna Fédica, la cual fué publicada recientemente, donde aparece una lista completa de todos los profesionales que se encuentran en Cuba y de los que han salido el extranjero. Esta revista la envié por el mes de rebrero o Marzo de 1967 al Dr. Augusto FERNANDEZ, que se encuentra en el Florida State Hospital, Chattahoochee, en la Florida, habiendo recibido la notificación de que dicha revista llegó sin contratiempo alguno.

Por sus relaciones con el alumnado, por haber sido instructor de Cátedra de Pediatria, hasta el año 1960 y por sus vinculaciones con la clase médica cutana, a través de su actución profesional y de la diriger cia del Colegio Lédico Nacional y del Colegio Médico de la Habana, institucioner

en donde desempeñó diversos cargos, pudo conocer ampliamente el desarrollo
de la medicina en Cuba hasta el 30 de Abril de 1967, es decir ha podido co-
nocer también el desenvolvimiento de la medicina cubana durante el régimen
castro-comunista. Siendo lo que a continuación expreso un enjuiciamiento
del mismo en su triple aspecto docente, profesional y clasista.

Aspecto docente.

La Universidad de la Habana fué fundada en el año 1728 y fueron precisamente
los estudios médicos los primeros en ser organizados como Facultad. Si ol pa-
sedo puede venagloriarse de haber sido cuna de dos nombres preclaros en la His-
toria de la Medicina, como son Tomás HOMAY, sabio introductor de la vacura er.
Cuba y el Dr. Carlos J. FINLAY, genial descubridor del agente transmisor de la
fiebre amarilla, En la época republicana adquirió justa fama por la calidad de
sus profesores, la rigidez de sus planes de estudio y la brillantez de sus gra-
duados. Pero no es el momento de citar nombres que justifiquen tales asevera-
ciones. Basta decir tan solo que la Facultad de Medicina, precisamente, estaba
clasificada como A-l en el ranking de las facultades similares del mundo entero,
al igual que las mejores universidades de los Estados Unidos de América.

Con el advenimiento del régimen comunista de Fidel CASTRO, comenzó la desintegra-
ción de la Universidad de la Habana, para volverla a integrar, como una rueda más
en la inmensa maquinaria comunista del Gobierno. Siendo precisamente facultei
de Medicina la primera en ser atacada, alegando diversos pretextos de ínacie se-
cundaria, lo que trajo como consecuencia la renuncia de la mejor parte de su pro-
fesorado. Con la emigración de los médicos cubanos casi en masa, que repudiaban
el régimen totalitario y tiránico que se instauraba en la Isla, agudizániose la
carencia de profesores en la Facultad de Vedicina.

Kodo de resolver este grave problema que se le creaba al régimen de Castro.

En primer lugar nombramio profesores de "dedo", es decir que nunca hicie nin
guna prueba de capacidad para adquirir sus catedras, sino que deben au norimit
to por ser militantes comunistas o por la exclusiva voluntad del Hector o local,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 130

autoridades comunistes cubanas que dirigen la salud pública. En segundo lugar,
importanio profesionales extranjeros de Paises Comunistas o Socialistas, o tien
de Países Democráticos, pero que son militantes o simpatizantes ocultos de loa
partidos comunistas locales. Toios estos profesionales son habilitades inu.edia-
tamente, incluso para ejercer la profesión médica, por un simple decreto recto-
ral.

Así como un examen imparcial de este profesorado, nos permite afirmar su baja
calidad, y por una razón muy sercilla; por ser todos con rarisimas excepciones
profesores improvisados, sin ninguna historia o experiencia médica-pedagógica.
Y aquellos rarísimos, repetimos, que pueden poseer alguna, por haber sido ante-
fiormente profesores de la facultad, no tienen la libertad de enseñanza propia
del carácter liberal de la Vedicina, sino que están sujetcs a la férrea discipli-
na colectiva propia de los sistemas marxistas-leninistas.

Del alumnado puede decirse sin exageración alguna, que es el más malo en la larga
historia de la ya bi-centenaria Universidad de la Eabana. Como lo qué se quiere
obtener es un tipo de médico político, ciego observante de las reglas comunistas
poco importa la preparación médica de los alumnos. Si antiguamente se requerian
7 años de Escuela Primaria y 4 o 5 de Bachillerato, hoy cualquiera, con wa simple
exámen, las más de las veces amañado, puede hacer su ingreso en los estudios mé-
dicos sin haber cursado ningún tipo de preparación en la Primera o Seguda Enser-
ñanza, lo que si se exige es una militancia activa dentro de los cuadros del Per
tido Comunista Cutano, es decir, que no estudia en la Facultad de Medicina, el que
quiere o tiene vocación por estos estudios, para ello hay que demostrar de un modo
fehaciente la vinculación al régimen. Y cuando se tiene sospecha de uns tula ad-
hesión por cualquiera de los alumnos, inmediatamente se celebra una "Asamblea de
depuración", en la que 99 veces de cada 100 es expulsado aquel que tenga la mala
suerte de ser señalado por sus compañeros, en definitiva, que la clásica y corsa-
grada libertad de ersei.anza es un rito en el régimen comunista curano.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 131

En algunas asignaturas no existen las pruebas de capacidad generalmente aceptadas por todas las universidades del mundo, es decir el exámen, bien de tipo un u otro. Pues en el afán de graduar médicos con el fin de poder reemplazar inútilmente a la gran masa de profesionales emigrados, las notas se dan por simple asistencia a clases, hay que graduar médicos a toda costa, dicen los dirigentes comunistas y para que se vea hasta donde llegan en este sentido, vaya la siguier te anécdota vivida por el Dr. BEATO, la cual refleja con exactitud esta gran preocupación de los jerarcas del régimen. Se trata de un antiguo alumno de la época pre-comunista, que cuando CASTRO se apodera del poder, le faltaban pocas asignaturas para graduarse de médico. Como es un cubano demócrata, aprobó todas menos una, que no quiso examinar, para no coger el título de médico bajo el régimen comunista, cosa que repugnaba a su conciencia, pero cuando los dirigente de su curso le apremiaron para que se examinara, so pena de ser expulsado si no lo hacía, no tuvo más remedio que hacerlo, pero buscó adrede el suspenso, contestando mal la casi totalidad del exámen, a pesar de esto, y de hacer malisimamente el exámen, fué aprobado. He aquí la nueva versión del castro-comunista, de hacer médicos a palos.

En el plan de estudios médicos, existe una asignatura "Marxismo" que es indispensable para continuar la carrera. El alumno que no posea el aprobado en la misma, jamás será médico, no importa que sea brillante en Patologia o Terapéutica, jamás obtendrá el título mientras no se haga un alumno aventajado en esa asignatura. Así que lo que se quiere obtener por el régimen es un tipo de médico político, que responda siempre a las orientaciones de la dirigencia comunista y no a los cánones sagrados del clásico arte de curar.

Todas estas cosas han dado origen a un tipo especial de médico, que el pueblo cubano le ha dado a la broma y le conocen con la denominación genérica de "oin-co picos", porque la prueba final, la gran prueba, la que los consagra ante lou ojos de los jerarcas comunistas es "La subida durante cinco voces al Pico Tur-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

-5-

"quino", la montaña más alta de la Isla. Esto que parece escapado de la mente de un alienado es lo que exige CASTRO, para que un médico se gradúe, no importa que el alumno tenga una gran vocación por los estudios médicos, no importa que haya demostrado su capacidad en la materia que son propias de la Medicina, si no tiene aptitudes de alpinista o no quiere hacer la gran escalada, no se gradua y no obtiene el título. Por estas razones, se podrá observar del temor casi sagrado con que son mirados estos médicos denominados "cinco picos" por la población cubana, que con razón los desprecia y que justificadamente rehusa tenazmente todos sus servicios.

### Aspecto Profesional:

El ejercicio de la medicina es hoy una pesadilla para los médicos que tengan la desgracia de permanecer todavía en Cuba. No hablo, claro, está, de los médicos integrados al Partido Comunista Cubano, los cuales gozan de todos los privilegios y prerrogativas de la "nueva clase" sino del resto de la gran masa médica que aún vive en Cuba, cuyo 90% abandonaría el país si tuviera oportunidad para hacerlo.

Cuando un médico pide permiso para irse de Cuba, lo tiene que hacer ante un funcionario del Ministerio de Salud Pública, un tal Capitán FOLS, quien despacha los martes en los salones del antiguo Colegio Médico Nacional (hoy desaparecide;).

Teniendo que presentar la solicitud por escrito, y entonces dicho funcionario se la firma y le declara tranquilamente que tiene que esperar un año después de la fecha de la solicitud. Inmediatamente comienzan las represalias por parte del régimen, rebaja de categorías, traslado de empleos, cierres y confiscación de consultas, etc. es decir todo lo imaginable para que el médico cambie de opinión al seutir todo el rigor del gobierno esclavista que sufrimos actualmente en Cuba. Hay que decir con orgullo que son muy raros, rarisimos, los casos que renuncian a la sali..a del país, pues con moral altisiva, la intensa EL yoria de los médicos soportan con dignidad toda osa clase du vajaciones, para


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

poder obtener algún día la ansiada libertad.

Los que trabajan en alguna depondencia del Estado, y hoy en dia todos los servicios médicos en su enorme totalidad, están bajo el control del Estado, se encuentran sujetos a una disciplina despótica que anula toda independencia personal, tan propia del ejercicio de la más liberales de toda las profesionen como es la Medicina. Se le controla lo que receta, el número de indicacionas que hace, los análisis que prescribe, tiene que cumpli su trabajo bajo un horario estricto, como cualquier burócrata secundario, y lo que es peor, está sujeto a la vigilancia no tan solo de sus colegas directores de la Institucić. sino también de los llamados Comités de Vigilancia y de las Secciones del Far-tido Comunista, encargadas de supervisar las funciones todas de la institucić. y que llaman inmediatamente al profesional "al orden" ante cualquier aspira-ción de quebrantamiento y que incluso lo juzgan ante Asamblea de todos los tra bajadores, médicos y no médicos.

Las medicinas son pocas y malas, el Ministerio de Salud Pública, envia a todos los profesionales cada dos meses, una listica cada vez menguante, de los medi-camentos que pueden obtenerse y que contados por el entrevistado no pasan de 700 productos. El avance de la Terapéutica, que día a día está registrado por la prensa médica mundial, no se conoce en Cuba, cuyos médicos se ven oblizados a recetar medicinas ya en desuso en los países avanzados del orbe. Productos de uso general y obligado en la práctica moderna, como el Acth y los derivadce. corticosteroides, escasean frecuentemente y en esos casos, cuando el paciente de clientela particular va a comprarlos a una botica, por necesitarlos urgente-mente, se le contesta que no las hay y que están a nivel de Hospitales.

Fuera de las investigaciones rutinarias de laboratorio en Cuba, no se practica ninguna de las técnica modernas de investigación clínica. Las radiografias 6. tán limitadas a una cantidad diarias, que no puede sobrepasarse, y determinat....


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 134

-7-

métodos de exploración radiológicas, como son las colecistografías y pielografías, son muy dificiles de hacer por la falta de los medios de contraste adecuados.

Las consultas privadas están llamadas a desaparecer en el régimen comunista según ya proclaman a todos los vientos, los jerarcas del gobierno y por una razón muy sencilla; porque, las consideran centros de competencia a la medicina oficial, pues todavía el médico privado a pesar de todos los obstáculos se esfuerza en dar al paciente una medicina de calidad superior a la que este encuentra en los Centros Hospitalarios y asistenciales del Régimen.

Aspecto clasista:

Los médicos cubanos, como clase habían llegado a una organización modelo en su género, que fue copiada y sirvió para organizarse a muchas instituciones similares de otros países, tal era el Colegio Médico Nacional (antigua Federación Médica de Cuba) que agrupaba hacie el año 1959 unos 7,000 médicos cubanos. Así como bajo su actuación se obtuvieron una serie de conquistas laborales y un ansiado Retiro Médico para la hora del descanso y de la vejez.

Había un Código de Moral Médica y funcionaba dentro del Colegio, una serie de Tribunales de Disciplina, que valaban por el estricto cumplimiento méiico, es decir agrupaciones con criterios disimiles en cuanto a la orientación de la medicina como clase, independientes de todo lo que significara militancia ao-tiva dentro de la politica nacional. La dirigencia colegial se elegía a través de elecciones democráticas, en las que participan todos los médicos, re-partiéndose los puestos ejecutivos de acuerdo con la representación proporcio-nal de cada partido. Es decir que como en toda organización democrática, ha-bía una mayoría que gobernaba y una minoría alerta y vigilante a cualquier transgresión de las leyes colegiales.

Todo esto ha despparecido desde el mes de Abril de 1966, en que el régimen de Fidel CASTRO declaró disuelto el Colegio Lédico Nacional y extinguida todas


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

sus funciones de protección a los médicos, de esta forma, se perdieron do. un plumazo, todas nuestras reivindicaciones, muchas de las cuales estaban regadas con la sangre y el sacrificio de muchos de nosotros. En su lugar existe hoy en día un régimen de trabajo esclavo, que no admite méritos y capacidad en el orden profesional, sino una ciega obediencia a los principios Karzista-Leninista. Habiéndome enterado por amigos colegas de la profesión, de que en el mes de Enero o Febrero de 1967, apareció en la escuela actual de Medicina una lista completa de todos los médicos cubanos que han tomado el Foreign-Board en Florida, U.S.A. y sus correspondientes calificacio-Desconociendo como una cosa tan privada ha sido posible de que se pudie

se publicar en Cuba, siendo las causas de que entre el sector médico, exista el recelo de hablar al ver que cosas confidenciales como son esos exámenes, puedan ser publicadas en Cuba, por lo que se piensa en la infiltración comunista dentro de dicho organismo.

A mediados del mes de Marzo de 1967, cuando me dirigía al Archivo Nacional, el cual se encuentra ubicado en la Calle de Compostela y San Isidro en la Habana, para realizar estudios de investigaciones históricas de la Vedicina gu-bana, adonde todos los días solía ir, pues en uno de esos dias al salir de di-cho Archivo Nacional y tratar de tomar la Ave. del Puerto para ir al british Club, que se encuentra en Prado, pude observar de que dicha Ave. estuvo interrumpida al tránsito durante varios días, no recuerdo días exacto, pero si sé que un solo día extremaron la vigilancia en el puerto, además de no permitir que se acercase nadio, logrando ver desde los muelles de la Terminal del Ferry Habana-Cayo Hueso y a una distancia de unos 50 a 100 mts. camiones y rastras cargando objetos de toda clase de tamaños, éstos objetos eran de madera y pue-do decir de que un modelo de las cajas de madera era de unos 12 mts. de largo por unos 2 mts. de ancho, no recordando el alto de la misma, así como las me-

didas anteriores son aproximadas, ya que no lo recuerdo con lujo de detalles, por ser vista a ojo de aguila y a la distancia antes mencionada. También pude ver colocados a lo largo de los muelles y en la calle, depósitos de distintos tamaños, pareciéndome el menor de ellos como de unos 55 galones. Siendo todo cuanto puedo precisar al respecto.

### Jose Bustermanto

### 38-133-06

### 20 February 1966

1. On 3 February 1966, contacted US Public Health Service, regarding Jose Angel Bustamante O’Leno. Fecul has been in the US since 1961, lost see Bustamante in 1920. Although not a close friend, Fecul has known Bustamante for fifteen or twenty years; he refers to him as “a professional acquaintance--a medical acquaintance”.

2. According to Fecul, Bustamante--nor fifty-one years old--is well cal widely known in Cuba as a strong Communist. He was a Communist Party member in his youth, a quite concern situation in Cubes (and other latin American) colleges and universities. Fecul stressed that it is only a matter of hearsay, but it is believed that Bustamante was a Communist Party member while in medical school, but was separated from the Party after his graduation, because of some trouble. The Communist Party then referred to him as a traitor, imperialist lackey, etc. Bustamante was then forth known as a strong left-winger, although not a Communist Party member. He proceeded to develop “a tremendous practice” during this period. Bustamante gradually worked his way back into the good graces of the Cuban Communist Party leaders and was returned to membership after Fidel Castro took power.

3. Also a matter of gossip in Cuba was a story of Bustamante having been involved in a love affair with a married woman during a visit to New York City some years ago and being denied permission to return to the US as a result of this alleged escapade. According to Fecul, Bustamante has also had other “troubles with the ladies”, has been accused of making passes at female patients.

4. Fecul further describes Bustamante as “a bright, intelligent, clear-minded fellow and a good psychiatrist”. He was President of the Cuban Medical Association for two years and vice president of a World Medical Association meeting held in Cuba”, while a medical student, he was President of the Students’ Association of the University of Havana.

5. Fecul again describes as “gossip” a story: Bustamante had been left at a well-known Havana institution for orphans (which he ridicule mounted in the well where was my less: a baby, playda ball, could throw the device stunned to take the child into a building). He was later replied by taken care baby

5.  to us an coat. A pious, devout Catholic, she died in 1977 or 1953, left some property to Bustamante. Bustamante himself is a confessed atheist and Marxist; Mantal believes Bustamante's wife, a Th.D teaching at the high school level, is probably the same.

6.  Freud further stated that Bustamante has two children, a son, now eighteen to twenty years old, and a younger daughter. That the son was "around twelve to fifteen years old. He was, according to Freud, extremely effeminate and, because of this, 'a source of much atavin" to his father.

7.  Freud feels that the circumstances of Bustamante's birth, adoption and upbringing may have embittered him and contributed greatly to his leftist philosophy. Freud also believes that these same circumstances may have contributed to Bustamante's interest in psychiatry, i.e., they may have led to a search for a better understanding of himself and his problem. Freud's own attitude toward psychiatry and psychiatrists is also worth considering; he flatly stated, "I don't believe in them. I prefer a good priest".

8.  Based on the gossip regarding a New York City visit of Bustamante, mentioned in paragraph three, Freud suggested a check with the US Immigration and Naturalization Service for further background on Bustamante. In discussing further leads, Freud said that at least eighty percent of the Cuban physicians in the US would have known Bustamante to some degree or other, because of his two-year presidency of the Cuban Medical Association.

9.  Of the many Cuban physicians in Washington, D.C., Freud mentioned two men practicing at the dispensary in the Public Health Service building "downtown", Drs. (fnm) Hachado and (fnm)Tremols. He knows little about Tremols; Machado is in his sixties, has been in the US about five years.

10. Freud's prime recommendation as a source of information on Bustamante, however, is Dr. (fnm) Huertos, President, Cuban Medical Association in Exile, Miami, Florida. He would have much information on Bustamante and would be a source of leads to other psychiatrists in the US (probably four or five individuals) who could be expected to have considerable information on Bustamante.

11. We assume Dr. Huertos has been contacted by the Miami Office. Drs. Marisco and Tremols look like relatively marginal leads, but we will be pleased to contact them if desired. Otherwise, please close Case HMC-3 for the Washington Field Office.

Case 46,632 - Additional Information on Dr. Jose Angel Bustamante O'Leary

1. Dr. Augusto Fernandez-Conde promised to furnish additional details in an effort to complete the information which he had already supplied on Dr. Bustamante and which was presented for your consideration in NO-16-66 of 17 January 1966. He has now reported to us the following results of his efforts thus far.

2. In paragraph #15 of NO-16-66, Dr. Fernandez-Conde mentioned that in 1960 Dr. Bustamante had deposited money and some of his wife's jewels in a repository in Mexico City for safekeeping. He further recalls that on another occasion Bustamante arranged for a friend to take another sum of money and more jewelry to Mexico City and to deposit them there. Ellseo Perez-Stable, M.D., Veterans Administration Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15240, is reported to know the identity of Bustamante's friend who transported the money and jewelry to Mexico City for safekeeping and possibly might know more about the size of Bustamante's deposits abroad.

3. In paragraphs #9, 13, and 18 f of NO-16-66, our informant touched on the brainwashing techniques which Dr. Bustamante employed on certain individuals detained at the G-2 prison in Havana. He suggests that Oscar Sagredo, M.D., whose current address is Rodriguez Sampedro 10, Madrid 15, Spain, was well acquainted with Dr. Bustamante's professional methods and particularly with his brainwashing techniques. Dr. Sagredo was formerly one of Cuba's outstanding psychiatrists. After leaving Havana, he was employed as Professor of Psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia and later moved to Madrid to reside.

4. In paragraph #18 c of NO-16-66, Dr. Fernandez-Conde named Dr. Scarizza as the individual who psychoanalyzed Dr. Bustamante. His full name is Spartaco Scarizza, M.D., and his current address is Via Ammannati 61, Rome, Italy.

5. Dr. Fernandez-Conde recently received a letter dated 13 January 1966 from his good friend, Dr. Gunnar Gundersen, Gundersen Clinic, La Crosse, Wisconsin, in which the latter asked him the following:

"Sometime I wish you would write me in regard to our mutual adversary, Jose Angel Bustamante-O'Leary. I presume he might be one of Castro's henchmen if someone hasn't taken a pot shot at him which might have resulted in his liquidation. Even that would have been too good for him In my judgment!"

6. According to Dr. Fernandez-Conde, Dr. Gundersen was formerly President of the American Medical Association as well as President of the Council of the World Medical Association. Bustamante was a member of the Council during Dr. Gundersen's administration. Our source suggests that Dr. Gundersen should have accurate Information about Bustamante's reactions and attitudes.

7. We shall pass on the remaining Information promised in paragraph #19 of NO-16-66 as soon as it is received from Dr. Fernandez-Conde.

Case 45,632 - Dr. Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE O'Leary: Background Information/
Professional and Personality Evaluation

1.  On 12 January 1966, our representative called on Dr. Augusto
    Fernandez-Conde at his office in the Florida State Hospital, Chattahoochee,
    Florida, and discussed the requirements of Case 46,632 with him. He as most
    cooperative, jave his wholehearted attention to the subjects for discussion,
    and provided a considerable amount of pertinent information.

2.  Dr. Fernandez-Conde has known Dr. Jose Angel Bustamante O'Leary since
    their undergraduate days In the late 1930's at the Facultad de Medicina, Uni-
    versity of Havana. After Bustamante's graduation in 1939 and Fernandez-Conde's
    graduation in 1940, their professional contacts still continued although their
    political persuasions were quite different. From 1953 or 1960 to August 1961,
    Fernandez-Conde had little or no contact with Bustamante, and since August/1961,
    when he left Cuba for permanent residence in the US, Fermarley-Conde has had no
    first-hand knowledge of Bustamante's activities. The information which he pro-
    vided on Bustamante is presented below and is dated between the late 1930's and
    1:59/1960.

3.  Dr. Bustamante was born about 1911 in Havana and has lived there all
    of his life. He never knew his father. He made his home with his so-called
    aunt, who was locally belleved to be his natural mother. His aunt is no longer
    Ilving. The uncertainty about his ancestry has constantly plagued Bustamante,
    and Dr. Fernandez-Conde suggests that it may be one of the motivating factors
    In his personality.

4.  Dr. Bustamante is married to the former Maria Luisa Rodriquez-Columble,
    a native of Barracoa, Cuba. It is commonly believed that Maria Luisa is part
    Negro. Lending credence to this statement is the fact that Maria Luisa kept her
    mother completely in the background and never brought her to Havana where she
    would have become known to Maria Luisa's and Jose's friends. Dr. Fernandez-Conde
    suggests that Maria Luisa's excessive concern over her antecedents probably moti-
    vates her aggressiveness. In seeking high social position in the community. Her
    brother is Dr. (fnu/ Rodriquez-Columble, a child psychiatrist, who is a well-
    known homosexual.

5.  Dr. and Mrs. Bustamante have two children, both of whom have been
    enrolled in the best Roman Catholic private schools in Havana. Thelr daughter
    is row about 18 years old and is described as being a pretty, healthy teenager.
    Their son, Jose, Jr., Is about 19 or 20 years of age and is very effominate in
    manner. Dr. Bustamante is known to have been worried about his son's personality
    problems when the boy was nine years old and his classmates taunted him as being
    a sissy. In the intervening years, Jose, Jr. has become a homosexual and has
    been under the psychiatric care of, first, his father, who was not successful In
    treating him, and more recently of Dr. Carlos Acosta-Modal and of Dr. fnu/
    Soraequi (now deceased). On many occasions, Dr. Bustamante complained to our

Informant that his son was frequently involved in scrapes and had caused him a great deal of trouble. Dr. Fernandez-Conde suggests that Marla Luisa's attitude towards and relationship with her son may have a strong bearing on the latter's behavlour. He also suggests that Marla Luisa, but not Jose, Sr., Is vulnerable where their son, Jose, Jr., is concerned. The subject of sexual aberrations came up several times during this Interview. It seems appropriate to point out here that, according to Dr. Fernandez-Conde, there are many homό sexuals among current Cuban government officials and the possible exposure as deviates would not serve as a threat to the security of these individuals. He states that homosexuality is given no importance in Castro's Cuba./

6. The Bustamante marital union has not run smoothly, to say the least. In 1945 or 1946, Jose, Sr. had an affair with Mrs. *Linu/* Alvarez-Tabio which become a "public scandal," as the saying goes in Cuba. Mrs. Alvarez-Tabio attempted suicide and came very close to death. While Jose, Sr. is knoim to have had affairs with other women both before and since ils liaison with Mrs. Alvarez-Tablo, the one in which he was involved between 1951 and 1360 (and possibly later) brought him the greatest amount of notoriety. Unfortunately, Dr. Fernandez-Conde cannot recall the name of this mistress. On one occasion, Dr. Bustamante and his Inamorata registered as man and wife in a. New York City hotel. The lady's husband got wind of their whereabouts, had private detectives to obtain compromising photographs, and precipitated. Dr. Bustamante's local arrest and detention on several charges. The latter put up.ball, but subsequently fled the US before the case came to trial. When he was President of the Cuban Medical Association, Bustamante tried to use his pro- fessional influence to solve the problem of his being a fugitive from justice so that he could travel to the US with Impunity. His efforts to exert pressure on certain Important officials met with no success. The mistress was divorced by her husband and continued her relationship with Bustamante, as recently as 1360 and possibly later. She Is reported to have become a "mental case."

7. During the course of this latter affair, Jose, Sr. and Maria Luisa on a few occasions came almost to the point of divorce. "But, by then he had become a man of some importance in the Castro regime and for appearances' sake they remained together. As recently as 1960, Maria Luisa spoke vehemently against Jose, Sr. In private, while in public she tried to make it appear that all was well in their menage. Dr. Fernandez-Conde has no first-hand knowledge of Dr. Bustamante's extramarital affairs since 1960/1961. From refugees who left Cuba in recent years, however, he learned that Dr. and Mrs. Bustamante still live in their large residence in Miramar, located on 12th Street between First and Third Avenue, Havana.

8. Dr. Bustamante obtained his medical education at the University of Havana and received his HD degree from that institution in 1339. He was one of the fifteen outstanding medical students in his class. He interned at the University hospital in Havana. His specialty is psychiatry and his practice has been in the psychotherapy area of that field. He used to be a follower of Freud but has since switched to the Pavlovian school. He continues to maintain

his office for the private practice of psychiatry in K Street, between 17th and 19th Streets, Vedado. Havana. Our Informant agrees with your statement that Dr. Bustamante is currently considered to be the outstanding psychiatrist In Cuba. Dr. Bustamante speaks English fairly wall and French to a limited extent. It is significant that in 1959 he was farsighted enough to begin lessons in Russian. Our informant has no knowledge of Bustamante's progress or current proficiency in that language.

1. Dr. Bustamante was a close friend of Dr. Emilio Mira-Lopez, who is now 11366/ reported to be practicing psychiatry in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Mira- Lopez was born in Catalonia, Spain, and is believed to be a Spanish national. During the Spanish Civil War, he was engaged in brainwashing prisoners and, at the conclusion of hostilities, he had to leave the country. He apparently proceeded to Cuba where he met Bustamante and subsequently exerted a profound professional influence on him. He is known to have trained Bustamante in the brainwashing techniques which he had used with prisoners during the Spanish Civil War. According to Dr. Fernandez-Conde, Dr. Mira Lopez is a despicable, loathsome person and exerted an evil influence on Bustamante.

10. Dr. Bustamante's first public affiliation with Communist groups was as a member of the Liga De Juventud Comunista between 1931 and 1939. lie wos aiso a member of the Ala Izquierda, a medical leftist group, and he was President of the Federacion Estudiantil Universitaria. By the time he had graduated from the University in 1933, he was believed to have been in agrce- ment with the purposes of the Communist Party although he may not have been a party member. Later, he was for a while a member of the Accion Inmediata (founded in December 1938), a political group in the medical profession which was not Communist. In 1946, he was one of the founders of the Confederacion Medica Panamericana, which still exists (1966), and in 1950, after the Castro takeover, he founded another political party in the medical profession, the Partido Medico de la Revolucion.

11. During the 1940's and the 1950's, Dr. Bustamante gradually became well known in the medical profession and achieved some measure of affluence. In 1943, he held an office in the Colegio Medico Nacional de Cuba and In 1952- 1953 he served as President of this organization. About 1954, Dr. Sustamante: asked permission of the Colegio Medico Nacional de Cuba to become a member of Nanigo so that he could study and evaluate its Influence on the Negro. culture In Cuba. The Nanigo is a secret Negro society in Cuba which practices witch- craft, offers human sacrifices, and indulges in other activities repugnant to Vestern civilization. Permission was granted because of the allegedly scien- tific nature of Bustamante's interests. Some time later, Professor Federico Sotolongo, who is still /1966/ a member of the medical faculty of the University of Havane, told another doctor in the Colegio medico Nacional de Cuba that Bustamante was doing a good job of Infiltrating the Nanigo. Since Sotolon jo is a Compaunist, the Inference was that Bustamante's performance benefited the Communist Party. Dr. Fernandez-Conde stated that he needed no further evidence that Bustamante was a trusted member of the Communist Party. Moreover, he is a very good friend of the Chilean Communist Salvador Allende. Allende always stayed in the Bustamante home Wien he visited llavana.

12. Dr. Bustamante's actions during the Batista regime are of Interest. Batista's mother-in-law (the mother of his third wife, Marta Fernandez de Batista) worked in some capacity for Maria Luisa Rodriguez Columble de Bustamante about this time and, on the surface, the Batista and Bustamante familles were on friendly terms. However, In reality, Jose, Sr. was working against Batista as a member of the underground group, Monte Cristo, headed by the well-known Justo Carrillo. At the same time, he maintained contact with the Communist Party and is known to have had private_meetings on a continuing basis during the Batista regime with Carlos Font, now 11266/ Vice Minister of Health, and Jose Lopez Sanchez, current Vice President of the Cuban Academy of Sciences.

13. When Fidel Castro came to power, Bustamante's potential was brought to the attention of Raul Castro. He offered to take charge of the brainwashing activities of the G-2 and thus put into practice the tecliniques he had learned from Kira-Lopez. He was subsequently put in charge of such work and was assisted in it by Drs. Acosta Hodal and Soraegui. After Dr. Soraegui's death, Raul Castro went to the latter's office and supervised the removal of patients' files, obviously for future use in building up dossiers on the subjects.

14. Dr. Fernandez-Conde pointed out that, also after the Castro take over, Bustamante wanted to be made Director of the Mental Hospital In Mazorra, eight miles outside of Havana. The position was given instead to Dr. Ordaz, who had fought with Castro in the Sterra Maestra. At first, Bustamante com- plained bitterly about losing out, but since then he has not asked for or otherwise sought another similar Important professional post. Dr. Fernandez- Conde suggests that Bustamante most probably has been told that he is performing an Important military service for the regime and therefore it would be wise for him to remain in the background. He further states that Bustamante is believed to exert a considerable amount of Influence. In the Ministry of Health, although he holds no official position in it. It should be noted that Bustamante's Importance in the regime, however great, stems_principally from his usefulness to Raul Castro. Bustamante is currently 11966/ considered to be one of the 10 most effective enemies in the regime of the non-Communist Cuban doctors.

15. Dr. Bustamanto is not believed to be in any sort of financial trouble. As his professional stature grew and his wealth increased, he and his wife soon acquired a taste for a luxurious way of life. They bought a pre- tentlous home in an exclusive residential section of Havana, bought a Cadillac, and enrolled their children in select; private schools. They both are driven by ambitions for social prestige and high political position. They crave money and power, want to be associated with those at the highest echelon in the regime. and, above all, are opportunists of the first water. Marla Luisa has always longed to be a member of the Jockey Club and of the Liceo (a ladies cultural society). She realized her dream of belonging to the Licco and even became President of it. Then, In 1960, Maria Luisa was made interventor of all private schools in Cuba. She resigned from the Liceo; they sold the Cadillac and bought. a small, compact car in an effort to play along with the regime's Imane. Another Important point about their finances, Dr. Fernandez-Conde points out, is the fact

SECRET

Case 46,632 -5- NO-16-66
17 January 1966

that in 1960, while on a trip to Montreal for a medical meeting, Dr. Bustamante took a large sum of money and his wife's jewels with him and deposited them in safekeeping somewhere in Mexico. The source of this particular information is Dr. Hector Weltz, a former close friend and confidant of Bustamante. Dr. Woltz still lives in Cuba and is described as being anti-Castro.

16. Dr. Fernandez-Conde states that Bustamante is intelligent, industrious, well-grounded in his profession, gregarious, able to make and carry out decisions, but is not a particularly forceful person. He is insincere, devious, a physical coward, and inordinately afraid when his life is in danger. He has many personality complexes. He seldom drinks and boasts about his abstemiousness where liquor is concerned. He may occasionally drink a glass of port or vermouth if the situation demands it. Maria Luisa drinks but not to excess. Neither is addicted to dope. Harle Luisa's Achilles heel is her overprotective attitude towards her son, Jose, Jr. Both Dr. and Mrs. Bustamante are opportunists, love money and power, and will go along with the regime so long as it serves their best interests to do so. They have already taken the precaution of depositing cash and valuables abroad to use in the event of the overthrow of the Castro government and the need for them to flee Cuba. Very little exact information is available about the state of Maria Luisa's health. Jose, Sr. is described as being in good health. He suffers continually from flat feet and is known to have undergone a hemorrhoidectomy in the distant past.

17. Dr. Bustamante has only three close friends in Cuba. They are all Communists. They are the following individuals:

a. Dr. Leopoldo Araujo-Bernal, President of the Colegio Medico Nacional de Cuba, Havana,
b. Dr. Carlos Acosta-Nodal, practicing psychiatrist in Havana,
c. Dr. Oscar Garcia Fernando, practicing physician in Havana.

Almost all of the doctors left in Cuba are anti-Communist and are violently opposed to Bustamante. The following two such individuals would be able to provide detailed background information on Bustamante:

a. Dr. Raul de Velasco Guzman, former President of the Colegio Medico Nacional de Cuba (1956-1959), 3rd Avenue between 10th and 12th Streets, Miramar, Havana. Dr. de Velasco has a sister and a son (Raul) now in Miami. Raul, Jr. is in his third year in the Medical School of the University of Miami.
b. Dr. Jorge Beato, Paseo Street and 17th Street, Vedado, Havana.

18. Dr. Fernandez-Conde suggests that the following individuals should be able to provide vital information on Dr. Bustamante or Mrs. Bustamante. With one exception, they are now living in the US.

a. Dr. Fidel Aguirre, 730 Livingstone Road, Elizabeth, New Jersey, telephone --289-9000. Dr. Aguirre was formerly President of the Havana Medical Association. He will be able to provide background and professional information on Dr. Bustamante.

b. Dr. Enrique Huertas Pozo, now President of the Colegio Medico Cubano Libre (Cuban Medical Association in Exile). His address is 213 Arragon Avenue, Coral Gables, Floride. His unlisted telephone number is He 5-7500. Ho, too, will be able to provide all types of Information on Dr. Bustamante.

c. Dr. /fnu/ Scarizza, Rome, Italy. Dr. Scarizza is an Italian national, once lived in Cuba, but now practices psychiatry in Rome. During his residence in Cuba, he was the analyst used to psychoanalyze those Cuban medical students who expected to specialize in psychiatry. He had Dr. Bustamante under analysis for more than a year and therefore sliould have unique insight into this patient's personality problems. Dr. Scarizza on several occasions mentioned to Dr. Fernandez-Conde how much trouble he was having with Bustamante during his analysts. Bustamante frequently missed their sessions of treatment although he always pald for the professional services.

d. Hr. and Mrs. Enrique Leon, New York City. Mr. Leon is a lawyer and now [^1] works in the New York office of Julio Lobo, who was so prominent in the busines life of Cuba before the Castro regime. Mrs. Leon is the former Rosario Rexach. Mr. and Mrs. Leon were probably the closest friends Bustamante had before 1959/1960. They were members with him of the Ala Izquierda and she was a former President of the Liceo. They are no longer Communists. They left Cuba in early 1960 for permanent residence in the US.

e. Mrs. Conchita Castaneda, 716 Fife Avenue, Wilmington, Ohio 45177. Mrs. Castaneda is a Quaker (one of the few in Cuba) and is now [^2] teaching in the Quaker High School in Wilmington. She was Maria Luisa's closest friend and confidante and lived with her. She should be able to provide detalled information about Maria Luisa's personal life, about Bustamante's extramarital affairs, and their effect on Maria Luisa's life.

f. A Cuban national who left Cuba In late 1961 for permanent residence in the US. Dr. Fernandez-Conde cannot recall his name, but will obtain his name and address from one of his friends in the US. This Individual was believed to have been a member of the underground movement in Cuba and in March 1961 he was Interrogated by Bustamante in a series of interviews at the G-2 prison at 5th Avenue and 14th Street, Miramar, Havana. He would be able to describe Bustamante's performance in this capacity.

19. Dr. Fernandez-Conde will be very glad to clarify any statements in his. discussion of Dr. Bustamante or to amplify them if requested. In addition, he promises to obtain the current street address of Mr. and Mrs. Leon, the name and address of the individual who was brainwashed by Dustamante, and possibly. Or. Scarizza's first name and street address in Rome. We will forward this information as it is received.

8 March 1966

1. Dr. Augusto Fernandez-Conde has notified us that the New York City address of Dr. and Mrs. Enrique Leon Soto is 310 East 70th Street, Apartment 9K, and their telephone number is LE-50170. Mrs. Soto is the former Rosario Rexach. Dr. and Mrs. Soto were Incorrectly Identified in paragraph 18 d. of N0-16-66 of 17 January 1966 as Mr. and Mrs. Enrique Leon.

2. Unfortunately, Dr. Fernandez-Conde's efforts to learn the name and US address of the Cuban national mentioned in paragraph 18 f. of N0-16-65 of 17 January 1966 were unsuccessful. He states that Pepita Riera, who is now a radio commentator in Miami, was once a patient of Dr. Bustamente and knew him very well. She also has some knowledge of the brainwashing activities engaged in by Drs. Bustamante, Carlos Acosta-Modal, and Abdo Canasi at the Cuban G-2 headquarters in Havana. He suggests that she may also be able to identify the Cubans who were brainwashed by Bustamante et al and who are now available for Interview in the US. Miss Riera's address is Box 516, Coral Gables, Florida.

3. This completes the contributions made by Dr. Fernandez-Conde in satisfying the requirements of case 46632.

o. Castro's Alleged Illness and treatment in the USSR

65 and earlier

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

- Cuban national, A 17 357 520, graduate medical doctor. Source is a specialist in psychiatry and served on the staff of Mazorra Hospital in Havana for over 20 years. He also had a large private practice. Source arrived in the U.S. via airlift on 14 April 66.

This report was developed by CAC representative assigne to the office of preparation.

As of June 1966 rumors are rampant concerning Fidel Castro’s mental condition and a U.S. wire service has reported that he is undergoing mental treatment in the USSR.

Although I have no firsthand knowledge, I do believe that it would be the case. There are still competent psychiatrists in Cuba, particularly Dr. Jose Angel Bustamente, who reportedly monitors certain electro-shock treatments currently in Cuba.

I do not believe he is receiving electro-shock treatments because it would be too soon since the reports of treatments came to have received in October 1965. Based on my long professional experience, I believe that in cases of mental difficulties following such a series of electro-shock treatments would best be handled by medication. There are a number of medications which could be used and which are available in Cuba.

1. Medical colleagues of mine have told me that there is a home near the Colon Cemetery in Alturas del Vedado Suburb, Havana, which has been converted into a research labcratory called Instituto de Investigaciones de Actividad Nerviosa Superior, [Institute for the Research of Superior Nervous Activity.]

2. Dr. Jose Angel Bustamante, a well known psychiatrist in Havana, another psychiatrist, Dr. Roselie, and some Sovbloc psychiatrists conduct research work and experiments there with animals, especially dogs, according to my colleagues. They report that these psychiatrists follow the Pavlovian theory in the "physiology of the nervous".

3. They also told me that Dr. Jose Angel Bustamante has for several years conducted, or supervised, interrogations of political prisoners at G-2 headquarters in Havana, using the narcohypnosis (sic) method, popularly called "brain washing".

4. Dr. Bustamante has been considered a card-carrying Communist long before Castro came to power. I can not vouch for the veracity of this, because I have not known him that well. However, I have heard it said repeatedly.

SUBJECT:

GENERAL - Operational/KUCAGE
SPECIFIC - Arthur G. VAIVADA-Request for KUCAGE Operational Clearance

It is requested that an operational clearance be obtained for VAIVADA which will permit the Station to discuss with him KUCAGE operations in the student field. We realize that VAIVADA is fully occupied with his present duties, and it is not intended to place any responsibility on him for KUCAGE operations. It would be of great assistance to the Station, however, if the writer could be permitted to obtain VALVADA's views on the type of KUCAGE activity in the student field which might be most likely to succeed, and capitalize on his knowledge of the field by using him as a spotter. (we have in mind the organization of a student political action team similar to the one operating in Brazil under project ALKALINE-C.)

DATE 17 April 1956

GENERAL - Operational - KU TUBE
SUBJECT: SPECIFIC - Arthur G. Vaivada

REFS: (a) HKH-W-1607, 30 March 1956
(b) HKH-W-1505, 28 December 1955

1. Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed promotion of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires also at this time to bring to the attention of Headquarters the merits of granting Vaivada staff status either concurrently with the promotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasible.

2. The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status, for a number of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Vaivada has not been entitled to the standard step increases that accrue to regular GS employees. Horeover he has not had the benefit of recent legislative increases in basic salary rates, such that his salary, originally set 16 August 1954 at the then GS-9 level, is still $5060.00 per anmum. Perhaps of more importance than the foregoing considerations is the fact that this agent has been and is losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and other more long-term advantages available to staff personnel. The agent has several times expressed to the case officer his concern, as a family man, over the fact that he is not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. Vaivada's expressed career interests lie in continued employment by KUBARK, more especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments in the field, and in view of his qualities of character and high level of performance for KUBARK the Station has no hesitation in recommending to Headquarters that he be awarded the desired change in status.

3. In view of the agent's present salary level it is recommended that the promotion from his present grade be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per anmum salary of $5,915.00. If Headquarters concurs in the recommendation that the agent be granted staff officer status, the agent would move up to the GS-11 grade at that time.

DISPATCH NO. KAPOK #309
1201-E-1524

TO Chief of Mission, Mexico City DATE 17 JUN 1954

FROM Chief, WHD

SUBJECT { GENERAL 0 Operations
SPECIFIC Arthur G. VAIVADA

1. The following information on Arthur G. VAIVADA is being forwarded so that you may consider using him in Mexico City as a contact agent, in which capacity he has served KUFIRE most ably in the past four years. His present contract, which became effective on 1 September 1953 for a two year period, provides for a salary equivalent to grade GS-7, with allowances.

2. A review of the Headquarters file indicates that subject is an aggressive, rather well qualified operative, who has enjoyed a good measure of success and has exercised good judgment under operational stress. He desires a career with this Agency, and is devoted to the work. Subject's academic education has been designed to fit him to become an economist. Prior to entering a contract relation-ship with KUFARK, subject had received U. S. Army intelligence training and had worked for Air Force Intelligence in Panama. He was trained covertly by instructors of WBARK in Washington, D.C. in the latter part of 1953. His instructors indicate that they were most favorably impressed and feel that he possesses a sound practical knowledge of basic clandestine operational principles and should become an increasingly valuable agent in the long range work of this organization.

3. The following is a summary and appraisal of subject's work which has been provided by the Costa Rican Desk at Headquarters:

a. He was recruited by the Panama station in November 1948, but in early 1949 he moved to San Jose, Costa Rica, where he enrolled in the University of Costa Rica as a student of economics. In June 1949 subject acted as cutout for two mail intercept agents and handled a low level penetration of the Communist Party. In October 1949 a very high level penetration of the Communist Party was also turned over to the subject, who was by this time devoting approximately

half his time to our work. Since that time his main
duties have been to act as cutout and direct these
agents. His most important single activity has been
debriefing the high-level penetration agent whom he has
been able to develop to a point where he and this one
agent constituted the most important assets to the
station.

b. In the course of his operational duties, subject has
proved himself to be very security conscious and to
possess a degree of initiative which has impressed the
station chief on more than one occasion. He has
participated in setting up safehouses, was responsible
for recruiting the two mail intercept agents, and has
provided the facilities for photographing the material
these two agents turn over to him for rapid processing
and return to normal mail channels. Subject has
recruited two additional agents, both of whom are
presently being used, and carried out a cold recruitment
attempt on a Communist. He participated in a technical
surveillance operation in early 1951 during which he was
in charge of the monitoring post together with an
indigenous agent under his direction.

c. Subject is an expert photographer and at one time operated
his own photography shop in San Jose. He is also fairly
proficient in sending Morse code, is trained in the use of
firearms and has studied and worked with charts and maps.
He is considered an expert in writing reports. Subject
has proved himself to be knowledgeable in the usual
techniques of covert operations after four years of working
in San Jose, and has proved to be invaluable to the
station in spotting and/or recruiting additional agents.

h. Subject will be available for duty in the near future. Should
you find his qualifications of interest and favor his entry
into Mexico as a contract agent, please advise as early as
possible. Dunshurst has requested that Subject's possible use

Plans for Improvement of Cover

REFERENCE: FI Memo of 13 December 1955

1. Referenced memorandum requested that WH Division forward
   to Chief, FI, on or about 29 May 1956, a report concerning plans
   for improving VAIVADA's cover (Habana University student on notional
   scholarship from WHD proprietary).

2. Negotiations are currently underway for the establishment
   of VAIVADA as a representative in Cuba for one of several U. S.
   polling agencies. Such an arrangement would afford certain opera-
   tional-contact advantages as well as a logical cover employment and
   apparent source of income for the agent. Efforts are being made to
   implement the proposed new cover arrangement prior to the 31 July
   1956 renewal date of Project AMPHODARCH.

Arthur G. VAIVADA; Contract Amendment

1.  A recent ruling by the Office of the General Counsel has ended the pay- ment of allowances, as such, to contract personnel. In the future those accounts previously paid as allowances will come under the heading of compensation.

2.  Since compensation is taxable, whereas allowances are not, additional adjustments have been made to compensate for tax losses incurred in the changeover. VAIVADA's contract has been so adjusted, and it is believed he will find the new quarters and cost of living figures to be equitable. The specific changes are as follows:

QUARTERS

Old "allowance" (non-taxable) $2,100.00
New "compensation" (taxable) $2,575.00

COST OF LIVING

Old "allowance" (non-taxable) $1,650.00
New "compensation" (taxable) $1,920.00

3.  Forwarded herewith are the original and one copy of an amendment to VAIVADA's contract, which reflects the above-described adjustments. The original should be signed and returned to Headquarters.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Contract Personnel Division

VIA : FI/Plans/Projects

SUBJECT : Contract Amendment, Arthur G. VAIVADA

1. It is requested that the contract of Arthur G. VAIVADA be amended to provide for an increase in salary from $5060.00 to $5915.00, effective 1 April 1956.

2. VAIVADA entered on duty with this organisation on 1 June 1949 as a contract agent. From June 1949 through August 1953 he was stationed in Costa Rica, where his record was outstanding and included the successful handling of a high level Communist Party penetration. He was subsequently given headquarters training for several months and participated in PBSUCCESS.

3. VAIVADA has been in Cuba in his present capacity (P/A, AMPHODARCH Project) since July 1954. His performance there has continued to be outstanding. He has proved to be particularly adept at spotting and recruiting of agents and his work has been highly praised by the Chief of Station, Habana. In recommending renewal of the AMPHODARCH project recently, FI/Plans/Projects stated, with reference to VAIVADA, that he "has obviously been a valuable, deep cover agent handler during six years of service for WH." He had been qualified previously as the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station.

4. There are sufficient funds in the AMPHODARCH project (approved 13 December 1955 for the period 1 August 1955 through 31 July 1956) to provide for the above-requested increase in salary. Such an increase will be specifically provided for in the next project renewal request. VAIVADA has been at his present salary level since July 1954.

VAIVADA has been such as to warrant promotion from his present grade (equivalent to a GS-9) to the equivalent of a GS-11, and proposes to recommend such promotion if the field concurs. An early reply from the field will facilitate prompt action on this matter.

# COVER PREPARATION - (Arthur G. Vaivada)

In compliance with Station and Headquarters requests, I am submitting an outline of my efforts and plans for establishing a legitimate (and permanent) cover occupation that will be suitable for movement and operation almost anywhere in this hemisphere. It is my understanding that there are two (local) cover proposals up for consideration and these will not conflict in any way the plan outlined herein, but actually will contribute to the realization of it. That is, during my tour at this station, I can ostensibly develope and strangthen a career in writing to the extent that it may "stand alone" as cover occupation. It is also pertinent to make it clear at this time, that my aspirations for a career in fiction writing are personal, sincere, and not in any way based on a desire to establish a particular type of cover. For this reason, I have divided this outline in two parte, the first partaining to my personal efforts and activities; the second being in the form of a proposal, available to me as a method of providing a writing career with a very legitimato appearance.

# I - PALMER INSTITUTE OF AUTHORSHIP

When in the early part of 1955 it became obvious that my University cover was not only weak but also identified with my targets and thereby creating a security dilemma, I began exploring the possibilities of utilizing my secondary cover which was "street photography". Financially this started out well but soon becare bogged down with labor and/or immigration technicalities. At this time I had simultaneously enrolled in the Palmer Instituto of Authorship at 1680 N. Sycamore, Hollywood 28, California. Frankly, in the beginning, I had little incentive or interest other than taking a "crack" at something I had always desired, but as tima and lessons have gone by, there is a very positive indication that I can make the grade. It is a one year course, considered quite competent and provides stepping stones into the publishing world. I aa nearing completion of this course, have two 5000 word short stories-submitted to publishers, one-short-story-analyzed-by-the- Institute and recommended for re-write and probable sale. My intentions are to try and "break the ice" in the fiction adventure at teen-age level. (Boy's Life, New Brunswick, N.J.)

# II CONTACTS IN PAPERBACK 300K PUBLISHING INDUSTRY

When I realized that with very little "padding" such as contacts with paperback book publishers in addition to my legitimate correspondence with magazines, this writing career could be very adequate cover, I made the recommendation_to the station some time in middle 1955.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

COVER PREPARATION - (Arthur G. Vaivada) (Cont'd)

Along these same lines, I took advantage of the opportunity presented when an old friend and AAF companion came down on a visit in July 1955. Warrant Officer Francis Williams has been in the A199 (Air Intelligence) since 1940, actually one of the founders of the service and has written AISS technical bulletins for 15 years. Williams was practically present upon my entry into this organisation (if not actually instrumental in my recruitment. I discussed the plan in general terms with Williams and learned that one of his section AI Officers is currently in the publishing business. William a assures me that when the right time approaches, he can arrange" a substantial contact with this company, with practically no security hazarde. We have left this pending. ((His address1 5846 Access Road, Page Manor, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton Ohio.))

While on a visit to San Jose, Costa Rica, I met and discussed this cover aspect with Arthur Gregor, currently a civilian employee of the Naval Air Station at Coco Soio, Panama Canal Zone. Art Gregor was considered by the station at San Jose (our station, that is) for recruitment in 1952. I submitted the complete Section I of the PRQ on him and we had a tentative arrangement that sometime in the future, whereever he might ba, if approached by the organization, he would work or cooperate with a temporary project, what ever the case be. (Gregor is specializing in minerology at MIT, and shooting for a Masters at the Colorado School of Mining.) Gregor has an uncle who is in the paperback book business. (publishing) and according to his appraisal, would not object to cooperating unwittingly to the proposal of such a contact. ((Gregor's addresss Box 2655, Cristobal, Canal Zone.))

In conclusion: It is realized that all this vordage may look very nice, etc., but actually the accomplishment of such cover will depend on whether-I-can-get-into-publication however minor-in-may-be. The efforts to "pad" the-existing authentic cover with the two projects above may sound "nebulous", but after all, outside of a tight professional league of staff writers (or immortals) writing is a nebulous undertaking. Finally, all of Part II here is submitted as a proposal, awaiting approval and dependent upon the success of Fart I.

Dear Mr. Vaivada:

Reference is made to your contract with the United States Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer, effective 1 August 1954, as amended.

Effective 1 January 1956, said contract, as amended, is further amended by deleting paragraphs one (1) and two (2) and all reference to Federal taxes and substituting in lieu thereof the following:

1. **Compensation.** In full consideration for the purchase of certain information and services, you will receive from the Government, payable in such an approved manner as you may direct in writing, the following:

(a) Compensation calculated at the rate of $5060 per annum; and

(b) Additional compensation for quarters procurement for you and your dependents presently calculated at the rate of $2575 per annum and applicable only to your initial permanent post of assignment overseas. As this additional compensation is based upon quarters costs at said post, it is subject to unilateral adjustment by the Government whenever warranted by a change in the factors affecting its initial establishment. Quarters will not be furnished you by the Government nor will you accept quarters provided by your cover facility without prior amendment of this agreement; and

(c) Additional compensation for cost of living expenses (other than quarters) for you and your dependents presently calculated at the rate of $1920 per annum and applicable only to your initial permanent post of assignment overseas. As this additional compensation is predicated upon the comparative cost of living between Washington, D. C. and your overseas post, your cover, family status and basic compensation, it is subject to unilateral adjustment by the Government whenever warranted by a change in the factors affecting its original establishment.

2. **Taxes.** (a) As your legal relationship to the Government is that of an independent contractor, all amounts paid directly or guaranteed by the Government under Paragraph one supra, are reportable as income under existing Federal income tax laws and regulations.

(b) In view of the security considerations involved, the Government agrees, at your request, to withhold Federal income taxes from the monies due you under this agreement in an amount equivalent to the United States income tax withholding schedule based upon your taxable income hereunder and present exemption(s). Sums so withheld will be paid over to

the Internal Revenue Service. You acknowledge that this is an accommodation on the part of the Government and does not release you from fulfilling your obligations under existing Federal income tax laws and regulations. You will be instructed as to the method to be followed in making timely filing of returns, estimates and payments in order to preserve security.

All other terms and conditions of the contract, as amended, remain in full force and effect.

SUBJECT: Arthur S. VARTAN(P)

REFERENCES: Memorandum dated 23 December from Chief, I&R, to Chief of Operations, LD/P, case subject.

1. This is an interim memorandum regarding the subject matter. With respect to paragraph 4.c. of the referenced memorandum, the LD Division is trying to obtain a factual written statement regarding the circumstances under which the original advance of $1,000 was made to the subject. Circumstances regarding this advance were given verbally to Mr. Warren Bean of the Inspection & Review Staff in October. The difficulty in providing a written statement at this time is due to our inability to reach the officers in FE/CD who authorized the advance. At the time of the advance the authorizing officers did not report directly to the Chief, all division.

2. With respect to paragraph 4.b., as to why the money has not been collected, we find that the FE/CD Finance Officer did take immediate action to provide for the collection of this advance. In order to pay back this advance the subject requested that his salary be paid in the field rather than at headquarters, we now find that the Finance Division, as of this date, has not taken the action requested.

3. This has been discussed on numerous occasions with the Finance Division with the assurance that it would be acted upon immediately. The Chief, Finance Division, has been advised of this matter and is taking the necessary action to facilitate the collection of the advance.

4. A detailed report as requested will be furnished as soon as possible.

Angel BOAN ACOSTA

1.  On about 20 November 1954, Arthur G. VAIVADA (Identity A) met Subject by chance on the street in Habana. Vaivada states that he knew Subject from February to May of 1954 in Guatemala City where they lived in the same apart-mant building. Apparently Vaivada's wife was of considerable assistance to Sra. HOAN ACOSTA when the latter was sick and by the time Vaivada left Guate-mala, a fairly good friendship hat arisen between the two families. Sr. Boan Acosta was cultivated by Vaivada because of Doan Acosta's known high level CP contacts in Guatemala. Apparently Ecan Acosta was of sone assistance to Vaivada at the University of Guatemala.

2.  Angel Boan Acosta is a Cuban, born in April 1925 at Camaguey, Cuba. He is currently a political writer for the weekly "Semanario", an anti-Batista magazine. He is married to Iraida HONTALVO of Las Villas, Cuba and has one child six months of age. They are currently residing with a sister-in-les in Santos Suarez, Habana. Subject was more or less an exile after 10 March 1952 because of his opposition to Batista. He went to Maxico first, and then received a fairly well paid job in the Covernment communist radio headquarters in Guatemala, where he was a political ccementator and radio script writer.

3.  Vaivada plans to continue here in Cuba his friendship with Subject with the idea of obtaining some local leftistyouth contacts of value. Vaivada does not believe subject is aware of Vaivada's employment by KUBARK or PEPRIME.

4.  This Mission's files indicate subject and a mumber of communists and communist sympathisers signed an anti-Batista declaration in 1952, according to the communist newspaper, Hoy.

5.  The Mission would appreciate any information tending to confirm subject's communist affiliations, or indicating that Subject is aware of Vaivada's employment by PaPRIME.

2.  VAIVADA has been a KUBARK contract agent since July 1949. His initial assignment was in Project HUMANOID in Costa Rica, where under a student cover he achieved a high-level penetration of the local BGGYPSY organi- sation. He was recalled to Headquarters in the fall of 1953 to par- ticipate in a similar project in Argentina, which could not be carried out because of refusal of the Argentine Government to grant him a visa. Recently he was in PBSUCCESS with additional duties as a cutout under Project ESCROW. He has completed three years of work at the University of Costa Rica and has one more year to finish for his B. A. degree in economics. His previous work as a contract agent has been excellent.

3.  VAIVADA's new contract becomes effective on 1 August 1954 and runs for * two years. His salary will be $5060.00 annually (CS-9) and will be en- titled to an equivalent quarters allowance. Transportation for VAIVADA, his dependents, and household effects, together with por diem in lieu of subsistence-in-the-course-of-the-travel to Cuba is_authorized, He is entitled to death and disability benefits under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, to continuance of pay and allowances under the Missing Persons Act, and to 14 days of annual leave per calendar year. Although VAIVADA is expected to get his B. A. degree in one year at the University of Habans, it is expected that the second year of his contract will be spent in some type of graduate work at the same institution.

## PROJECT AMENDMENT

CRYPTOMYM AMPHODARCH

DIVISION HD

STATION HAVANA, CUBA

HEAD QUARTERS CASE OFFICER:

For L. Malcolm

Room No. 2104 H Strs, I

Extension 2555

Date 22 July 1954

1. It is requested that an amendment to the Subject Project be approved wherein contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA (P) will replace contract agent Wallace C. RIKON (P). Operational Clearance for the use of VAIVADA in Project AMPHODARCH was granted 21 July 1954 (O.C. #25507).

2. Project AMPHODARCH is already approved for $5400 for the year ending 31 August 1954. This amendment will increase the cost of AMPHODARCH during the remaining month of this approved period by $1232.74. RIKON'S compensation, allowances, and expenses for the same period is figured to be $450.00. A breakdown of VAIVADA's expenses for the period 1 August through 31 August 1954 is as follows:

Compensation (CS-4) 421.67

Allowances 137.50

Travel 25.00

Operational Expenses 83.34

Transfer allowance 150.00

Living quarters 150.00

Transportation 340.23

TOTAL $1307.74

3. For a successful substitution of VAIVADA in place of RIKON in Project AMPHODARCH in Havana. It is necessary that the two contract agents be in contact/during the period 1-31 August 1954. Immediately following the submission of this amendment covering that period, a project renewal will be drawn up contemplating the use of VAIVADA in the project on a yearly basis with at least a two-year tour in view.

4. The general objectives, targets, and cover will remain the same in the project. As a part of the cover backstopping, a notional scholarship grant of $120 per month will be "awarded" VAIVADA by the DTEMBARGO mechanism. Complete correspondence and documentation on this grant will be carried by VAIVADA when he goes to Cuba.

5. Arthur G. VAIVADA has been a contract agent in the employ of KUEARK since July 1949, working in the HITAM Project in Costa Rica, and more recently in Project PESUCCESS with additional duties as cutout under Project ESCROW. VAIVADA has one more year of academic work to finish in order to receive an A.P. degree in Economics. This furnishes a logical and natural reason for him to matriculate at Habana University, with which are associated the main tasks, targets, and objectives of Project AMPHODA RCH. His previous work as a contract agent has been excellent and it is felt that with the substitution of VAIVADA for RIKON, a big improvement in the production of the project may be expected during the coming year. VAIVADA, a U. S. citizen married to a Costa Rican


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

Cuban contacts than RIKON who is a Puerto Rican, as there exists a certain amount of antagonism between Cubans and Puerto Ricans. YATVADA also has the advantage of having had three years of university work in Costa Rica.

6. It is the consensus of opinion among the interested officers at Headquarters and in the field that Wallace C. RIKON should be given the opportunity of serving elsewhere in Latin America in a locality and situation where he will have greater opportunity to produce results. Plans are now being drawn up to shift RIKON to another country in September 1954.

MEMO FOR THE FILE:

SUBJECT: Commercial Photography (VAIVADA)

1) By definition this type of photography is in a class by itself. Simplified, it is nothing more than a man with a 35 mm flash camera moving rapidly throughout industry, commerce and any inspriritional activity, concentrating on the "individual at his job." There is no contract with the subject photographed, each operator, secretary or official is shot" with or without warning at his work. Within 24 hours the work is completed and the past card size, black and white copy is shown to the subject. Actually maintaining records, our experience has shown that approximately 93% of all shots are sold on the first exhibition.

2) Technically, the project is based on 3 very important precepts:-

I- Low unit cost of production is absolutely necessary since there is always a calculated sales-loss. In flash photography.

701-168871


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

2. 
The use of conventional bulbs pusher unit cost way up (to say nothing of low operating speeds). Therefore it is necessary to use electronic flash equipment i.e., unit cost per flash = $.0075

II- Highly Standardized photography and processing. Using one film (Kodak plus X), one paper (kadabromide F-2,3) and two developers always. (Dit-20. Snegrein & D-72) One size, (postcard), continuity of framing and extension of enlargement, equal density in negatives.

III- The professional capacity to exploit a situation rapidly, establishing a verbal contract with the immediate management of an organization and the ability to take your pictures in very rapid succession while maintaining a high standard of quality in your negatives.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

### 3) EQUIPMENT & COSTS:

1- Camera, 35 mm, preferably a sharp and fast lense. f/2 Xenower. chable 35& 50mm lenses. - $120. 00

1- Electronic Flash Unit, storage bttry type, 90 watt sec. out-put minimum. - 75. 00

1- ENLARGER, 35mm, single condenser, auto-focus, of very good quality - 145.00

3- TRAYS, 11 x 14 in. Hard rubber - 20.00

1- TRIMMER, 8x10 (Kodak) - 10. 00

VARIOUS ITEMS allied equip. such as thermometer, scales, sponges, easel; Electrical wiring, etc. - 30.00

APPROX. TOTAL EQUIP. $ 400.00


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 59

4) So far, this has been treated with a purely commercial point of view in our work - the advantages are many:

a) All equipment may be carried from country to country in one small foot.locker or suitcase. May be set up and operating in 48 hours by one man - no labor problems, no security risks - adequate income appearances. May be taken down for movement in one hour.

b) Provides business contact in almost any point one might decide to penetrate, and almost at any time -

c) Absolute freedom of movement at all hours. Work if you want to take care of other business when necessary.

In event it should not be too inconvenient for you to stop at Gainesville on your way to Habana, I should be pleased to meet you personally.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Crozier,

I have just received with interest your letter of May 31 in which you reruested information about the scholarships granted by the Pan-American Foundation to continue your studies in economics at the University of Habana for the school year 1954-1955.

The information which you submitted in your letter indicates that you are qualified to be considered for a scholarship. But before any action can be taken, you must complete the enclosed application form and also submit a transcript of credits from the university previously attended.

For your information the scholarship can be extended to cover graduate work. The scholarships granted by the Foundation make provision for food and housing sufficient for both you and your family, though not necessarily for the same amount as you have indicated. You are advised to submit the information recuested by June 30, which the final date for applicants for the coming school year.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Wilgus,

As a student of economics with special emphasis on the Latin American areas, I wrote you in the letter dated 17 May for information about obtaining a scholarship through your organization for continuing my studies in economics at the University of Habana in Cuba. I should like to begin work there for the school year 1954-1955.

As to my qualifications, I have attended the School of Economics Sciences at the University of Costa Rica from 1949 through 1953. In all my previous courses I have done above average, as can be attested by the schools' concerned..

My present desire is to continue my study of economics at the University of Habana for one year, or as long as it may be deemed necessary to obtain a Bachelor of Science degree in economics. I am also interested in the possibility of having the scholarship renewed at the end of the period, so that I may be able to begin graduate work in economics. Because I am a married man with two small children, I would like to know whether the scholarship granted would be sufficient to cover the cost of good and housing in addition to tuition, books, and the normal academic expenses, which I estimate to be about $3000.00 annually.

As to my personal history, I am a United States citizen and shall be 32 years old in June. I have served in the United States Army and Air Force between 1940 and 1949, with the exception of an eight month period in 1945 and 1946. The areas in which I served are India and Burma in World War II, and Panama after 1946. Because of my long residence in Panama and Costa Rica I speak Spanish fluently, as does my wife who is of Costa Rican nationality. As mentioned before, I have two young children born in 1949 and 1951 respectively.

I realize the above information may be insufficient in order to determine whether I qualify for a scholarship, and I should be glad to provide any additional information that you may require. Please also send me whatever forms necessary for making formal application for a scholarship.

Sincerely yours,

Ross L. Crozier

TO: Chief/WH Division
Attention: Mr. Hanke
DATE: 29 March 1954
FROM: FD/O & L/Agent Service Section
SUBJECT: Offset Clause - Arthur B. VAIVADA

1. Reference is made to your memoranium dated 26 February 1954 concerning the necessity of deducting Subject's GI allowances (not tuition payments) from salary due and payable by CIA.

2. Pursuant to the provisions of 38 T. S. Code 1952, Focket Supplement 267, par. 6a regarding the payment of education and training allowances, the following limitation on such payments is imposed:

> "That in no event shall the rate of allowance plus compensation received exceed $210.00 per month for a veteran without a dependent, or $270.00 per month for a veteran with one dependent, or $290.00 per month fer a veteran with two or more dependents: Provided further, that only so much of the compensation as is derived from productive labor based on the standard work week for the particular trade or industry, exclusive cf overtime shall be considered in computing the rate of all allowances payable under this paragraph."

3. It is further provided by 36 U. S. Code 1952, Pocket Supplement 336 that:

> "No eligible veteran shall be paid an education and training allowance for any period during which * * * the payment of such allowance would constitute a duplication of the veteran from the Federal Treasury."

4. In view of the above quoted provisions of the U. S. Code restricting the entitlement to allowances under the GI Bill, Subject's cchtract will have to be amended to reflect an offset clause for such sums received under the GI E111 since he cannot reject such compensation from Veterans Aizin-istration for security reasons.

5. In this connection,

RYBAT/PES CCESS

1. In answer to reference, it has been determined by the appropriate office at Headquarters that VAIVADA is not entitled to receive compensation from both this organization and the Veterans Administration. The enclosed contract amendment has been written to provide for an offset between subject's salary from this organization and the Veterans Administration.

2. VAIVADA should be informed that Headquarters is appreciative of his alertness to this situation since it will be easier to adjust his financial situation now rather than have to turn back a fairly large sum of money in the future. It is to be noted that the amendment is written in such a way that when he stops receiving the Veteran's payments at the end of his eligibility period, the full amount of his salary due from this organization will again be deposited as heretofore.

Vaublad boy

Razberry

1. As has alroady been reported, Arthur G. VAIVADA and depondente arrived in Guatemala City on 2 January 1954. The first of several contacts with him was successfully accomplished on the night of 14 January 1954. Subject currently is living temporarily in an apartment hotel; however, he has already rented a small, inconspicuous apartment located in a middle-class neighborhood. He has purchased a few picces of inexpensive furniture for the apartment and intends moving his family to the premises witain the immediate future. Subject's choice of neighborhoods in which to reside is believed excellent. The apartment is located in a fairly busy section of town, is on a busy street served by public buses which trevel to all parts of the city and is of such rodost appearance that it will attract no attention.

2. Subject has registered with the local university and is in the procese of developing contacts which may prove valuable in the future. Concerning subject's entry into the University he has pointed out that this type of cover is or here and that at an undetermined date in the future he may request authorisation to discontinue this cover for one of a mor_lorical nature. However, until this matter is discussed at greater_length_with_headquarters in the future, subject will continue to attend his classes to put in an appearance.

3. Subject's wife is a native-born Costa Pican national. According to Quatemalan law she automatically ecomes a Guatemalan citizen at the time she establishes a residence here. tecause she doos not wish to accept Guatemalan nationality but desires to retain her own nationality,_subject_has_through_a_local_attorney-arranged to have his wife granted the status of a termanent Resiment but _not_a_naturalized citizen. In this way-sne-will enjoy all the privileges of a Guatemalan citizen except the right to vote. She Fill be able to work or engage in private business of her own. Subject will have all the necessary details completed in this connection within the next few days.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 82

HGG-A-687
Page 2

4.  Subject currently is exploring the possibilities of having his wife open a small photographer's shop in her name. According to the attorney handling his wife's papers this is possible and subject would be able to attend classes and at the same time earn more money. Due to the fact he is known as an ex-G.I. and a married man with two children, the fact that he does commercial photographic work while attending university would appear only logical. However, this point will be discussed with headquarters if and when subject believes the time is right to branch out.

5. The following question was brought up by subject which we feel should be answered by headquarters: Subject is receiving a regular salary from our organization which is deposited in his bank in the U.S. In addition and commencing within the near future subject will be receiving $130.00 per month from the Veterans' Administration which will be sent by regular U.S. Government check to the local Consulate. He has raised the question as to whether or not at some future date he nay be em- barrassed for accepting two checks from our government, or whether headquarters will deduct from his stipulated salary that additional salary which he will receive from the veterans' Administration. Any advice which headquarters can furnish will be appreciated by subject.

6. It was decided here that subject will in the future be the go- between in the ESCROW project. Accordingly, on the night of 22 January 1954, subject met ESCROW in a secure meeting place for the purpose of arranging danger signals, future meeting places and for the purpose of insuring correct recognition in the future. Henceforth, subject will meet subject twice or three times each week in order that ESCROW's potential may be exploited to the fullest extent. Subject is now scouting the used car lots in a search for a small used car. Once he has purchased a vehicle future meetings with him and between him and ESCROW will be held with a better degree of safety.

7. The $500.00-advance subject_requested prior to his arrival here was-handed_to_him by_the_undersigned. _ Subject_had_left_his_pre- vious place of residence prior to time the authorization was cabled by headquarters. The advance will be accounted for in reporting station's accounting records.

8. In summary, it is the undersigned's belief that subject is fitting into the local picture easily and effectively. The fact his wife is Latin is helpful to him, according to subject. He has exhibited an enthusiastic-attitude_and_a_calm, purposeful-manner-which-is-grati- fying. We will furnish headquarters with a progress report on this project in thirty days.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE

PROJECT BIRADIAL

1.  BIRADIAL, who was to have been dispatched to Buenos Aires, has been denied proper documentation from the Argentine authorities for entrance and residence in Buenos Aires.

2.  There is attached hereto a copy of a letter dated 6 October 1953 at San Jose, Costa Rica, which BIRADIAL received from the Argentine Embassy, Consular Section setting forth pertinent data regarding subject's entry denial. (This letter, received on 24 November 1953 had previously been sent to a mailing address in Dayton Ohio, namely Francis Williams, 5846 Access Road, Page Manor, Dayton. Since the letter was unclaimed at this address (BIRADIAL having learned later that Williams, an Army Officer friend of his had been shipped out), the letter was returned to the Argentine Embassy, Costa Rica and was subsequently forwarded to BIRADIAL's former address at Presidential Gardens, Alexandria, Va. The letter had been postmarked at Dayton, Ohio, 19 October 1953.

3.  On 25 November 1953 while in contact with the Agent he indicated the possibility of writing his wife's relatives, Alicia De Cruz and family, in Mar De Plata, Argentina, with whom contact is maintained, for the purpose of attempting to assist agent at that end in having the proper entry permit issued. He also indicated the possibility of returning to Costa Rica and while in that area being plausibly and legitimately employed while awaiting another Agency assignment. Inasmuch as a combination of factors lead to the conclusion that it would be unwise to attempt to exert other influence in an attempt to have BIRADIAL granted an Argentine visa, and for other cover considerations as well as the time element which may be involved, the matter was discussed with other representatives of who desired to take the Agent over in connection with PB Success.

4.  Arrangements were set up for Agent to meet the Chief of the Guatemalan Station. Subsequently, on 8 December 1953 Agent BIRADIAL was introduced in a secure manner, to Mr. E. Hobbing, by the writer. Hobbing will in the immediate future be handling BIRADIAL in connection with certain operational matters and as of 1 December 1953 BIRADIAL will be chargeable to PB Success.

5.  In accordance with the provisions of the project, BIRADIAL was paid $350.00 for his November salary: $93.00 for his tuition fee at American University and $468.00 for his per diem to cover his period of time while in Covert training.

6.  Proper receipts have been forwarded to Cedric Wolcott, Finance Division.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 86

SECRET

7. It should be noted, that Agent over a period of several contacts appeared to be very cooperative and his attitude was comendable. When he first learned that he had been denied entry to Evenos Aires, he was somewhat chagrined since he appeared to be set on an attempt to do a good job in a "tight" area. He had not given up hope to obtain proper authorization and was willing to pursue the matter further since he felt over a period of time he would be allowed proper entry authority. He suggested several possibilities.

8. Agent also expressed a desire to go to Cuba or anywhere else the Agency felt he could be of best service to the Agency regardless of the difficulties within reason, which may have been imposed on him and his family.

9. In view of Agent's past successful record with this Agency, in view of his attitude, his future possibilities and his comparatively limited salary it was suggested to Mr. Hobbing that he might consider a raise in Agent's salary.

10. The Buenos Aires Mission was on 7 December 1953 advised that Agent was denied entry to Argentina.

11. It should be noted that Agent has indicated that his wife has been maintaining contact with her distant relative in War De Plata who is expecting Agent and his wife to go to Argentina. In this connection, Agent on 11 December 1953 informed his wife had received a letter from her cousin. The letter indicated that difficulty should be anticipated in obtaining an entry resident permit to Euenos Aires but that it nevertheless is possible. Agent states the letter points out a plan for Agent and his wife to work out. Agent informed the letter was received a little too late since he is now on the other operation. He stated however, he and his wife will be in contact with Alicia De Cruz and family with a view toward the possibility of entering Argentina at some future date. (EIRADIAL is forwarding the above mentioned letter through Wr. Hobbing).

12. FI/Plans Staff is being informed to cancel Project BIRADIAL as of 1 December 1953.

13. Attached hereto-and-for-retention in Agent's file are the following:

(a) Copy of receipt # P-3283 for Agent's salary ($350.00) for the period 1-30 November 1953.

(b) Receipt F-556 dated 25 November 1953 for the amount of $93.00.

1. The above-named individual is Chief of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Finance on a full time basis. However, he is also the code and cipher specialist within the Costa Rican Government and personally provided the codes now being used by the Foreign Office and Seguridad Pública. This latter responsibility apparently stems from his hobby of working with codes and ciphers and the absence of any better-qualified expert on this subject. He is a member of the American Cryptogram Association, is a "ham" radio operator, an expert photographer, and an amateur chemist, among other things. During the 1948 revolution, he pro- vided the rebel forces with code systems and broke a code being used by the government forces. On other occasions he has furnished codes to the incumbent administration during times of emergency, such as the abortive invasion of Costa Rica from Nicaragua during 1949.

2. Officers of the Commercial Section of the Embassy have had cordial and cooperative relations with subject on commercial and economic matters for some time. Recently one of these officers advised us that subject had made tentative, informal inquiries con- cerning the possibility of obtaining technical advice and assistance from the Embassy or the Department of State with a view to improving the cipher system of the Foreign Office. It was suggested to subject that an official request to the Embassy for such information would probably result in a polite refusal, but that one of the Embassy officers, RUSSO, had had experience in codes and ciphers while serving in the Army, and that perhaps an unofficial-discussion would- be helpful.

3. On this basis, a luncheon date was arranged at which time subject stated that the Foreign Minister had recently questioned him for several hours on the security of the Foreign Office codes and possible means of improving them, and had instructed subject to study the problem. According to subject, the Foreign Minister then indicated serious concern over the threat presented by local and international Communist activities and speculated on various possibilities of cover- ing their activities.

4. Subject then digressed from code and cipher talk to the subject of secret inks, their use, and potentialities and possible methods of detection. He indicated that he was interested in establishing a secret censorship of suspect mail coming into the country, particularly the mail of known Communists, and inquired whether any assistance could be offered in this field of secret writing detection and clandestine censorship techniques.

5. In view of the fact that this sudden turn in the conversation struck uncomfortably close to the HUMANOID-1 and HUMANOID-2 operation, we attempted to discourage subject by pointing out that such a proposal was illegal and would have drastically dangerous political and legal repercussions if it were attempted and leaked out. We asked if Foreign Minister LARA had approved this censorship proposition and also inquired how the Foreign Office could possibly interest itself in a matter which would seem to come under the jurisdiction of Seguridad Pública. POVEDANO replied that it had not been discussed in plain words with LARA, but that he would discuss it with him in order to determine whether the matter should be dropped or explored further. He was cautioned not to tell LARA of his conversations with the Embassy officers.

6. Several days later subject advised that he had discussed the matter fully with Foreign Minister LARA and that the latter had been extremely interested in the proposal. However, LARA pointed out that the Foreign Office had no jurisdiction in this regard and told POVEDANO to discuss the proposition with Lt. Col. Gonzalo SEGARES, Oficial Mayor of Seguridad Pública.

7. According to POVEDANO, SEGARES became very enthusiastic about the idea and authorized subject to carry out further study and collect the necessary technical data and equipment. SEGARES offered to provide funds for purchase of required chemicals, etc., for experimentation in secret ink detection and instructed subject to make plans for the training of several additional persons in the procedure. Subject indicated to SEGARES that he would use his home darkroom and laboratory for this training and possibly even for the eventual processing of suspect correspondence.

8. With this official authorization and support, subject again inquired whether it would be possible for us to assist him in obtaining pertinent manuals, background literature, reference material, and technical advice on mail censorship procedures and secret writing detection. In view of subject's apparent official backlog and personal_determination-to-continue-his-inquiries,_we_decided_to_make a gesture of assistance on a confidential, unofficial basis with a view-to-controlling and possibly directing-his-activities.

9.  Accordingly, RUSSO described a personal friend in the Division of Communications and Records of the Department who had had considerable experience in censorship work and offered to make inquiries of this individual for any available material. It was also indicated that this person would be asked to comment on the probable reaction of the Department to an official confidential request from the Costa Rican Government for assistance. It was suggested to subject that he not discuss this matter with any other individuals pending a reply to our inquiries, to which he agreed. He also agreed that the best approach to this whole project would be to proceed only with training and planning activities at this time and not attempt to initiate actual censorship until an emergency arises, such as a Communist armed uprising or a third world war. However, on this latter point it is believed probable that subject would prefer to begin the activity regardless of whether an emergency arises, in order to obtain coverage of current Communist activities.

10. As is obvious from the above conversations, a number of operational possibilities (and hazards) are presented to us and headquarters comments and guidance are respectfully requested. Depending on headquarters desires and policies, we could possibly gradually discourage subject from ever initiating his project prior to an emergency while at the same time assisting him with pertinent written material provided by headquarters for his planning and training purposes. This would have the advantage of facilitating the organization of a competent crew on a stand-by basis who could be put to work if a world war were to break out. We could tap this government censorship activity. However, in view of our presently only limited post office coverage, a more attractive opportunity might be sincerely to assist subject, insure his development of a secure project, and substitute our present coverage by an all-Costa Rican operation. It appears that we could control such an operation either by working through subject or by dealing directly with Colonel SEGARES. In this latter situation, we could probably expand the activity to provide coverage of cable traffic, and possibly international telephone calls. A danger here is the traditional lack of security consciousness of Costa Ricans.

11. In any event we are faced with a situation which presents a potential security threat to our current post office censorship activity. Headquarters comments are requested as soon as possible on at least the following points:

a.  Will headquarters provide technical data on censorship methods for passing to-POVEDANO as though it were obtained from a friend of RUSSO? In this connection we have in mind possibly unclassified Army instructional manuals, etc.

b. Will headquarters approve our accepting POVEDANO'S

invitation to work with him on an unofficial basis in his planning and experimentation activities, thus keeping ourselves informed of his progress?

c. Is headquarters interested in the possibility of replacing our presently incomplete post office coverage with an all-Costa Rican operation which we could tap either through POVEDANO or directly through SEGARES?

d. Unless advised to the contrary, we will continue our present HUMANOID-1 and HUMANOID-2 activities during this period despite POVEDANO's project. HUMANOID will be alerted, however.

e. Is headquarters interested in our casually returning discussion to the subject of codes and ciphers with a possible view to assisting Costa Rica obtain systems to which we might retain a key?

f. Could headquarters provide an opinion as to what the reaction of the Department of State would be to a formal request from the Costa Rican Government for assistance on either codes and ciphers or clandestine censorship?

12. It is to be noted that POVEDANO knows RUSSO as just another Embassy officer. In all our discussion with him we have stressed that this is a subject which RUSSO cannot discuss in his official capacity, but would like to help on a personal basis because the activity would be directed against the Communists. POVEDANO has apparently accepted this relationship and assures that he has not indicated to LARA or SEGARES that he has talked with RUSSO, merely informing them that he, POVEDANO, would attempt to obtain reference material through friends in the American Cryptographic Society and elsewhere.

13. One lest comment. If headquarters decision is to stay clear of this whole proposition, it is earnestly requested that some few-items-of-background-material-on_secret_writing, or _book_titles_of_ overt publications_on_the_subject_be_furnished_us_to_pass_to_POVEDANO for the purpose of indicating a reply has been received to our inquiries. The continued good will of POVEDANO is deemed of operational value as he appears to be well connected in high government circles.

14. Also, in view of the fact subject will be questioning us continually as to what we have learned, and will be suspending other action pending our advice, we ask that an immediate answer, preliminary if necessary, be made to_this_dispatch.

1. The remarks contained in TRS-A-1056 and TRS-A-1034, the basis for your recommendation that HUMANOID be transferred to career agent status as well as all information in Headquarters files, which is relevant to HUMANOID's connection with our organization, have been thoroughly studied by the individuals of your Headquarters organization authorized to render a decision in the case.

2. It is regretted that in spite of HUMANOID's outstanding performance and his valuable contribution to the Station's activities, his qualifications are not those which properly fit him for consideration and appointment as a career agent. Headquarters is very much aware of HUMANOID's desires in this matter of career agent status, and it is hoped that the above decision will have no effect on the present high standard of efficiency which is being maintained by the San Jose station.

3. Paragraph 3 of TRS-W-766 refers to a dispatch which will be forthcoming from Headquarters. We regret the confusion conveyed by the original dispatch.

4. As regards TRS-A-1215, the raises in salary requested for FRANKIND-3, now designated HUMANOID-2; HUMANIST-2, now designated HUMANOID-3, and HUMANOID, the principal agent of the project, these salary increases have been incorporated in the revised project which was submitted for approval.

5. Though HUMANOID-4, formerly designated HUGGER, has been terminated as a salaried agent as of March 1952, it would be appreciated if Part I PEQ were-forwarded-as-requested in paragraph 4 of TRS-W-766, so that Headquarters records may be complete

Project HUMAN/KID-1 (How HUMANOID-1)
HUMAN/KID-3 (How HUMANOID-2)
HUMANIST-2 (How HUMANOID-3)
HUGGER (How HUMANOID-4)

3. A. Objectives:

f. Parallel penetration of Vanguardia Popular, Costa Rican Communist Party.

g. Development of additional sources of information on Costa Rican political movements.

B. Targets:

a. The personnel associated with the projects noted above are the only activities presently assigned under this heading.

b. Vanguardia Popular, and other V.P. sponsored groups.

c. Incoming and Outgoing mail units in general post office.

d. National ani subordinate committees of the Union de
Mujeres-Carzen Lyra.

C. Tasks: This project conforms to the tasks assigned to the
San Jose Station in 301-46, DI EI and E2.

4. Personnel:

a. This project, involves in addition to HUMANOID, EUMARKED-1;
HUMANKIND-3; HU: ANIST-2; and HUGGER, to be designated hereafter as
HUMANOID-1; HUMANOID-2; HUMAROID-3; HUMANOID-4 in the order they are
listed.

b. HUMANOID, is an American citizen, was born in 1922 in Dekalb,
Illinois. He joined the United States Air Force in April 1945 and
spent approximately five years doing general Air Force intelligence
vork. Subject is presently living in San Jose, Costa Rica where he
has been attending school, and since June 1949, when project EUMANOID
vas first activated, subject has been the most valuable single agent"
of the San Jose Station.

5. Cover: Subject is established in Costa Rica on a purely persona..
   basie, with no apparent connection with the San Jose station. He is a home
   owner, married, and is a fully accepted member of the community on that basis.
   Subjects activities in connection with HUMANOID-3 will be handled through
   safe house facilities to be acquired by the station. It is felt that the
   processing of the material acquirei from HUMANOID-1 & 2, can be done in the
   office of the Chief of Station, because of the small quantity of this type
   of caterial. The cut-out and direction activities of HUMANCE-4, will be
   handled by HUNAROID in periodic meetings in cafes, bars, or coffee shops,
   logical meeting places in San Jose.

6. Contact and communications: Contact between HUMANOID and other
   personnel involved in this Project is described above under Cover.

7. Control: The control of HUMANOID-is-based-upon-his-past-service
   record with the US Government, demonstrated loyalty, and the judgment-of-the-
   present and forcer station chiefs in San Jose. In addition HUTANGID is a
   US citizen, and needs the financial assistance he receives for the performance
   of his duties.

8. Special Equipment: Bo special equipment is involved.

9. Coordination: This Project vas originally initiated with the
   cooperation of the Panama Station. Continued coordination-with Panasa, or any
   other_station_is_not_considered_necessary or desirabie.

EVALUATION OF SERVICES
Excellent and of major importance to this station.

Evaluation of information
Information produced by subject through his sub-agents is, in some instances, documentary and of value. In other cases, it is eye-witness, high level, and of considerable value.

OTHER FACTORS
Current operational restrictions on this agent presently prevent full exploitation of his potential.

COMMENTS
Due to financial pressure, explained in TRSA-1142, HUMANOID has recently undertaken a part time job at the School of Agronomy. His work deals with laboratory and dark room photographic assignments and is connected with a Costa Rican Government project in Ceology. Subject is the most valuable agent available to this station and is believed capable of further develop-ti ment in the event current operational restrictions are removed. He is conscient ious, hard working, loyal, imaginative, and amenable to supervision. In view of his interest in a long range career, a reply to the question posed in TRSA-1142 concerning career agent status would be appreciated. Subject has been aware of the recommended salary increase which has been _pending_for_over_ten_months. Although_he has not questioned the delay, it is obvious that his self-confidence and professional pride have been shaken somewhat by the lack of official recognition. We feel strongly that agent has earned a raise and that an increase at this time is not only justified but would be in the best interests of our present and future operations. PLEASE

OBJECTIVES & TASKS: No change.

SALARY: Subject is presently receiving 1,000 colones per month. A raise in salary is believed Justified and is recommended below.

EVALUATION OF SERVICES: Services of this agent are extremely valuable. As the principal cutout of this station he is charged with the direction and guidance of the most productive sub-agents we have at the present time. His handling of these arents is carried out in a professional and efficient manner, and his personal comments and corrections on their reports, based on his long acquaintance with local personalities and conditions, are of considerable value. Ilis attitude remains enthusiastic and willing.

EVALUATION OF INFORMATION: The information produced by the agents handled by subject is probably the most valuable being obtained by this station. In addition to routine procuction, this agent's operations are well-suited to checking on information reccived from other sources.

OTHER FACTORS: Subject is presently seeking another safehouse to serve as a meeting place with subagents and for the processing of material produced by HUMANKIND-1 and 3. The photographic studio previously-used-as-a-safehouse-has been given up as explained in TRSA-1084.

COMMENTS (Con'd) activities and personalities and his grasp of the various revolutionary movements and figures has been freely shared with the Station Chief. These *briefing: meetings* represent an intangible contribution to the over-all performance of this Station. Subject is eager to expand his operations, and, if headquarters approves the removal of present operational restrictions, it is believed he can be given further responsibilities, particularly in the recruiting of additional sub-agents. This Station is presently interested in accomplishing a parallel penetration of the Communist Party, in expanding routine investigative coverage, and in developing additional sources on political movements. It is believed that subject has potential in each of these fields. However, as reported previously, HUMANOID is beset with financial problems which undoubtedly detract from his full working efficiency on matters of interest to us. His GI subsistence is currently terminated during the school vacations and a certain portion of his time is devoted to odd jobs in an effort to augment his income. The former Chief of Station recommended an increase from 1,000 to 1,500 colones in July, 1951, a recommendation in which the writer concurred. However, in the event current operational restrictions are removed, it is desired to recommend at this time an increase to sixteen hundred (1,600) colones per month. The additional one hundred colones permonth is suggested in view of the fact that subject has borrowed money in recent months to meet hospital bills, and because he has been aware of and probably counted on the raise recommendation of the former Chief of Station. Further, if the restrictions are lifted, it is desired to utilize subject's time to the fullest advantage without the handicap of his having to seek other outside employment.

In an effort to evaluate more accurately subject's agent-handling ability, the writer monitored a specially arranged 45-minute contact between HUMANCID and HUIANIST-2. From a concealed vantare point less than three feet from the participants, the writer was able to hear and see HUMANOID's handling of this sub-agent. The results were worth the effort. HUDANOID demonstrated complete control over the discussion, *exhibited_a_natural_ability_to_elicit desired details*, and issued instructions in a commendable manner. It appeared that subject=has the complete confidence_and loyalty of HUFANIST-2 and that his working relationship with this important sub-agent leaves nothing to be desired.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WHD-2/FI
Attention: Mr. John Cavadine
SUBJECT: Training Report on Arthur G. VAIVADA, (P) -
Training Alias: "VICKS"

1. Arthur G. VAIVADA was trained covertly by instructors of this
   office in Washington, D. C. from 5 October through 25 November 1953.
   The original Training Request Form dated 31 August 1953 reveals the
   following pertinent information:

"Subject is thirty-one years of age, married, and a U. S.
citizen by birth. VAIVADA's previous intelligence experience
includes eight years with the U. S. Air Force. During this
time he served as an intelligence specialist in the Panama
and Burma-India Theaters. In 1949 he was employed by CIA
and spent most of the following four years in Costa Rica
where he was engaged in the spotting, recruiting, and handling
of agents. Although subject has never lived in his proposed
area of operations, he possesses a fluent command of the
Spanish language. VAIVADA's future assignment, under contract
agent status, will be that of principal agent with the primary
objective to develop information on the Communist Party in
Argentina. He will also be expected to penetrate or direct
the penetration of the Argentine Communist Party."

2. The instructors who participated in Subject's training indicate
   they were most favorably impressed with VAIVADA and feel that he is
   qualified for his proposed mission. He possesses a sound practical
   knowledge of basic clandestine operational principles. He should
   become an increasingly valuable agent in the long range work of this
   organization.

3. VAIVADA received instruction in the subjects set forth on the
   attached Training Evaluation Reports. The following supplementary
   reading and discussion material were also covered.

Instructor's Comments:

VAIVADA impressed the undersigned as an exceptionally conscientious, mature individual. He has had considerable field experience, yet, he conducted himself during training as though this experience was only secondary to the more important task of improving his basic knowledge of clandestine activity.

Subject completed several excellent reports covering assigned reading material. These reports revealed the extent to which VAIVADA went to do a thorough, complete job. His oral discussions of the training material further substantiated the sincere effort this student made to obtain as much as possible from the training program.

Subject demonstrated and personally expressed his satisfaction with the progress he made and the benefit he obtained from the instruction presented to him.

Instructor's Comments:

VAIVADA has had considerable experience in the field, but he was ready to broaden and enrich his experience with the help of training. He has a strong bent toward his own opinion and exhibited independence of mind in analyzing Communist Party activities. He had no difficulty in absorbing the material presented. He has the ability to apply theory to practice and apparently is a person who is accustomed to rely upon his own judgment. His written work was excellent. He recognized his own shortcomings and readily accepted constructive criticism. From all the evidence during training, VAIVADA appears capable of handling the assignment proposed for him.

Instructor's Comments:

VAIVADA appears to be a hard, conscientious worker. He is quick and alert of mind and possesses maturity of judgment. Subject studied the training material with enthusiasm and expressed the desire to improve himself. VAIVADA displayed an excellent understanding of tradecraft techniques as portrayed in his written work. He has the ability to apply theory to practice. His goal was to improve himself to the best of his ability, as his past experience in the field had been on a trial and error basis. His experience in South America might account for his unhurried thinking and action, but it will undoubtedly assist him in his future operations as he simply refuses to become ruffled or panicky. It is the belief of this instructor that VAIVADA is well qualified for his proposed field assignment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Deputy, WH 4 December 1953

SUBJECT: Mr. Ross CROZIER

By pre-arrangement through Ar. Smyser I had an interview with Mr. Ross Crozier in my room at the Hotel Raleigh on the night of 2 December 1953 for the purpose of getting an impression as to whether it was possible that he could be used to advantage in our program.

Mr. Crozier has been a contract agent in Costa Rica for approximately 4 years. He is married to a Costa Rican and has 2 children, ages 2 and 4. He was in a student capacity in Costa Rica. From my nowledge of reporting done by the station in Costa Rica and the indication of sources of information in reports from that station, I am inclined to think that he very ably handled himself. In addition, I was very much impressed with him during the course of the interview and feel that he is an ex- cellent type, having all the necessary qualifications for giving sub- stantial assistance to our program. He has 7 months remaining under the GI assistance bill for educational purposes and it can be satisfactorily arranged by him to complete his education at San Carlos University, Guatemala. Under the Guatemalan law his wife, being a Costa Rican, becomes a Guatemalan citizen upon her establishment of residence in Guatemala and this is a distinct advantage.

He has a valid U.S. passport on which his two children are carried but it will be desirable that he enter Guatemala as a tourist, either with a tourist visa in his passport or on a tourist card. The children could also be issued tourist cards. The use of a tourist card eliminates the necessity of his reporting to the police. He can stay 6 months and then obtain a renewal of the tourist card without leaving the country. Within a relatively short time he unquestionably could be of distinct advantage to us on reporting on activities and attitudes of students and other elements.

He could act as a cut-out. I feel that he is qualified to actually develop a penetration into the Communist Party, a feat with which he had some success in Costa Rica. He could handle an important PP opera- tion with Enrique SALAZAR Liquens (also known as Oscar H. CARTA in station files), which operation is presently being handled through Donald O. Hediger. Irrespective of whether Hediger continues with Guatemala or is given assignment outside the country, I believe that it is important to have Crozier with us in Guatemala. We can find plenty for him to do.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE

SUBJECT: BIRADIAL

SECRET
Security Information

25 November 1953

On Wednesday 18 November 1953 subject was introduced to John Heyn. The introduction was deemed advisable, inasmuch as it would probably facilitate subsequent meetings in Buenos Aires where it is anticipated that subject will be operating, providing his visa is granted.

BIRADIAL indicated he had not heard from the Argentine Embassy of Costa Rica, hence is planning to have his wife write to follow this matter immediately.

BIRADIAL mentioned the fact that his wife's relatives, and with whom he may dwell when he first moves to Buenos Aires, may be in a position to assist in obtaining a visa for subject. He indicated that having a native of the country render some assistance in this regard may be the solution to any possible difficulties. It appears logical, however, he was informed not to make any approaches at this time.

He again noted that inasmuch as it will be necessary to stop in Costa Rica to pick up his visa when granted, he suggested the possibility of leaving for Costa Rica shortly following the termination of his covert training. As previously indicated he felt that his presence in Costa Rica, where he can plausibly maintain himself and his family, and where he may be in personal touch with the Argentine Embassy, may be to his advantage in securing his visa.

On 24 November 1953, subject called to inform he had received a letter from the Argentine Embassy in Costa Rica informing him his visa had been denied. He informed he still felt he could obtain it but it may be necessary to seek assistance from his wife's relatives in Buenos Aires or it may be necessary to go back to Costa Rica for a short period to finalize the matter. Too, he suggested that in the event he cannot obtain the appropriate permission to enter Buenos Aires the Agency may desire to send him some where else in Latin America, possibly Cuba (he mentioned specifically) or some other country. In this connection, he felt that cover-wise he and his family would be in a more secure position if they were in Costa Rica while awaiting placement.

I plan to see BIRADIAL on 25 November 1953.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Record

8 September 1952

SUBJECT : Project HUMANOID

1. A total of $5934.00 was originally requested for this project for the period 1 March 52 to 28 February 53. The amount actually approved was $6000.00 (Form No. 51-91, project folder).

2. $5100.00 of the approved amount was to provide for the compensation of four agents who were to be reimbursed as follows:

   HUMANOID 1600.00 (colones)
   HUMANOID-1 150.00  ("  )
   HUMANOID-2 250.00  ("  )
   HUMANOID-3 900.00  ("  )

3. The funding requirements for agent salaries were calculted (by the Headquarters case officer, Tom Barrett) at a rate 8 to 1 (e.g., HUWANOID was to receive $1600.00 or $200.00 per month).

4. However, the rate of exchange has fluctuated since the original funding estimates were made. The present rate is 6.63 to 1. Accordingly, the monthly pay scale for HUMANOID in U. S. currency would be approximately $241.00 (or $1600.00). The pay scales of the other agents are similarly effeated.

5. This situation was explained to the Budget office (Mr. Bauer, extension 2017) and the Plans office (Mr. Ziegler). I stated that dollar expenditures would be in excess of the amounts provided in the project if we were to continue payments to the agents at the colon rates previously established. Mr. Ziegler informed me that we could nonetheless continue the present colon pay scale. He further advised that budgetary adjustments could be made at a later date when it became evident that the project allotment would definitely be exceeded dus to currency fluctuations. A project amendment is not then required at this time. The station may be advised to continue payments in colones in the amounts shown in paragraph 2, above.

Security Information

20 hovember 1953

On Monday 9 "ovember 1953 a meeting was held with subject for the primary purpose of delivering nissalary for October 1953 amounting to 350.00. A receipt for the amount was outained and returned to fir. Wolcott, Finance Division. A copy of the receipt is retained in subject's file.

During the meeting, subject reported his schooling at American University will terminate in approximately three weeks. "is scheduled Covert training will also come to an end during the first week in December 1953.

Subject related he has not as yet received any news on his visa for Argentina for which he made application approximately 90 days ago. You will recall that subject anticipated it would take approximately 90 days to obtain such a visa.

BIRADLL informed if he doesn't receive word on his visa within the next week he plans to have his wife follow this matter by writing to the Argentine Embassy in Costa Rica.

Subject also presented this thougnt in the event no results are forth coming within the next two or three weeks: He related that in so far as his friends and wife's relatives in Costa Rica are concerned, he and nis wife and family are in the states on an extended trip. They are expected to return to Costa Rica. in so far as he knows, he, his wife and the Argentine Consul in Costa Rica are the only persons in Costa "ica aware that they have made application for the visa under question. in the event no positive results are obtained on his visa application, subject wondered about the advisabilty of returning to Costa Rica, to finalize his visa affairs and depart for Argentina.

The question of maintaining cover while in Costa Rica was discussed. In this connection he informed he would have no trouble finding a suitable job which would lend authenticity to him and his wife'sstatus. Too, it was indicated, and it' appears somewhat reasonable, for subject to remain in the U.S. presently for too long a period of time may raise some question as to his true status in the minds of Argentine Embassy Officials in Costa Rica as well as his friends and relatives in Costa Rica.

It is suggested that consideration be given to allow subject to return to Costa Rica within the near future if the appropriate Argentine Visa has not been received to: (a) Allow him to finalize such details (b) To preserve his cover status.

Contact will be maintained with subject for further developments. It is anticipated that John neyn will meet subject at the next meeting for the first time. This is recommended, inasmuch as fir. Heyn who will be in the pertinent arca, may be able to familiarize himself with subject.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief/Plans Staff/FI
Attention: Projects Branch/Plans Staff

SUBJECT: Project BIRADIAL - Request for Amendment

1.  Project BIRADIAL concerns the transfer of Contract Agent *humanoid* from Costa Rica to Argentina, with interim training at headquarters. Since approval of the project on 12 August 1953 *Humanoid* is now known as BIRADIAL.

2.  BIRADIAL, an American citizen born in Illinois in 1922, is married to a Costa Rican girl and has two small children. Since 1949 he has worked for CIA in Costa Rica as a contract agent and has proven himself particularly adept at spotting and recruiting agents and has successfully supervised the direction of a high level Communist party penetration agent. He has been the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station.

3.  BIRADIAL has been accepted as a student at the University of Buenos Aires for the school year beginning March 1954. He is presently undergoing covert training.

4.  In order to enhance BIRADIAL's cover while undergoing covert training, he has enrolled at American University at a cost of $93.00 a semester commencing 7 October 1953 and is pursuing his studies four days weekly.

5.  Since BIRADIAL is attending class at American University to enhance his cover during his interim covert training at headquarters, it is requested he be reimbursed in the amount of 93.00 and the project amended accordingly.

SECURITY INFORMATION

23 October 1953

On Wednesday, 14 October 1953 i met with subject at his apartment in the Presidential Gardens, Alexandria, Virginia for the purpose of obtaining his signature on the Travel Voucher prevously submitted covering his travel from Costa Rica to Washington, D. C.

BIRADIAL indicated that the combination of his schooling at American University in the mornings and his covert training in the afternoons which also keeps him busy during the weekend, is keeping him fully occupied. Though he did not press the issue, he wondered whether it would be necessary to continue his schooling at American University. He indicated he thought he could handle any inquiries regarding his activities satisfactually. We both decided however that, regardless of the hardship placed on him, he should continue his schooling at American University since any inquiries could then oe properly and legitimately backstopped. One of the difficulties involved is the amount of daily travel between the University and his residence.

Inasmuch as the distance involved plus the high rental cost factor (175.00 per month) present a few difficulties. This plus the fact that the plausibility of a student paying such rent is somewhat questionable, BIRADIAL indicated he might move to a more suitable location.

On 23 October 1953 he informed he was moving to 5008 - 7th St., N. W., Washington, D. C. as of this day for cover, convenience, and financial considerations. He will advise of his new phone number if and when it is available.

SUBJECT: BIRADIAL (202-2723)

7 October 1953

On Monday, 5 October 1953, the writer met with subject at his apartment to deliver the necessary "credentials" allowing his proper entry to covert training facilities.

During this meeting he informed that he was too late for entrance to George Washington University. He was then in the process of making inquiry at American University.

He also mentioned that he opened an account with a bank in Alexandria, Va. I'm not so sure that this was such a good idea--but the account has been opened. He had had an account with the Chase National Bank; however, he has closed this account since he claims he received such poor service from this bank while at his previous station. He stated he would like to have an account established with a large banking institution which has a branch affiliation in Buenos Aires where he will be assigned, so that his pay may be deposited in the U. S. securely by us.. It is suggested this be worked out with Finance.

On Wednesday a. m. subject called to inform that his home phone number is now Temple 6-8651. He has enrolled in American University and will attend classes daily from 9:30 a. m. to 11:30 a. m. He is studying Corporate Finance and other analysis courses. During the conversation he expressed amazement at the cost of $93 for schooling for one semester. Although he did not request reimbursement for this amount, it was inferred that he would undoubtedly appreciate it if this expenditure could be absorbed by us.

In view of subject's past excellent performance in behalf of this Agency, and inasmuch as he is not highly paid, it is recommended that Agent be reimbursed for this expenditure even if it means amending the project.

Agent has not been paid for the month of September. I shall check with Finance and deliver Agent's salary to him.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

SUBJECT: BIRADIAL 202-2723 2 October 1953

1. On 1 October 1953 the writer as George Wheeler was introduced to Agent Arthur G. Vaivada (P) by J. G. Hanke at his apartment E-21, Van Euren, Presidential Gardens, Alexandria, Virginia. The introduction was deemed advisable, inasmuch as Agent is to be inherited by Branch II. Mr. Heyn Informs he is not available to handle Agent at this time but will meet him in about three weeks.

2. In accordance with instructions received from Covert Training Offices, Agent is to report for covert training at 2400-20th St. !!. N., Washington, D. C. on 5 October 1753 at 1415 Ers. He is to ask for Mr. Cal. when he arrives. Agent is to be known as Mr. Vicks. The instructions were passed on to the Agent. He was also informed to call X2298 and ask for George Wheeler in the event he desired to make an appointment to discuss business matters.

3. In connection with agent's previous inquiry regarding the possibility of obtaining U. S. Citizenship for his wife, Mr. Hanke informed him that under the circumstances under which his wife entered the U. S., namely as a tourist, it would not be possible to plausibly apply for U. S. Citizenship. Hanke also informed that although possible to rush the Citizenship through, it was felt inadvisable at this time since the proceedure might jeopardize the present existing cover arrangement. Agent seemed to understand the difficulties involved and raised no particular objection.

4. Agent informed several neighbors had inquired as to the nature of his business. He has informed them that he is a student and is studying at George Washington University in the field of Economics. This story had been decided upon before the writer came upon the scene. Since Agent has not commenced study at GW it was suggested to him that he commence taking a course or two as soon as possible. He informed he would do this as soon as he learns of the details as to his hours to be devoted to Covert Training.

5. Although there is no assurance subject will be granted permission to enter Argentina, subject previously indicated he could forsee no problem in this regard. He did make inquiry, however, as to what his status would be should he not be allowed entrance to Argentina.

6. It is unfortunate that Agent is residing in the Washington D. C. area inasmuch as that in itself is undoubtedly considered as a Government Stigma. The possibility exists that the wrong person or persons will learn of his and his wife's presence in this area.

7. The file fails to reflect what provision, if any, has been made to pay the Agent. This will have to be worked out.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE

SUBJECT: HUMANOID 28 Sept. 53

1. During the debriefing of HUMANOID in Washington in August-September 1953, his wife mentioned an individual whom she had come in contact with while in San Jose.

2. This person was first seen in the Argentine Embassy where she was arranging papers for their travel there later. She had seen him previously around in San Jose, dressed in sport clothes and apparently a "playboy." He injected himself into a discussion between the Argentine Consul and HUMANOID's wife, showing great knowledge of Argentine visa regulations. This occurred in early July 1953.

3. HUMANOID's wife again saw the same individual in Panama on 22 August 1953, at which time she pretended at first not to know her, and then "recognized" her, but did not mention their meeting in the Argentine Embassy in San Jose.

4. Her description of the person is as follows:

height: about 6'
age: apparently 30
hair: receding at temples
eyes: not brown or black, probably hazel or grey
complexion: ruddy, young looking face, which was long and thin
characteristics: Smokes heavily, with dark stains right fingers. Top tooth on left side chipped. Wore dark glasses. Considered self quite a ladies man.
languages: Speaks Spanish with Argentine accent. Speaks English well since seen talking with U.S. soldiers in San Jose

5. When was seen in Panama, he was dressed as a common laborer and told HUMANOID's wife that he was working on a "fertilizer ship" there.

6. At no time did HUMANOID himself see this person.

7. A picture of Hugo Ramiro RODOLFO, the ex-argentine labor attache in Panama, was shown to HUMANOID's wife who stated positively that he was not the person she saw in Costa Rica and Panama.

MEMORANDUM FR FILE

SUBJECT: HUMANOID

1.  During the time that HUMANOID was at Headquarters on TDY in late August and Early September, he raised the question of the citizenship status of his wife, who has not yet taken out her first papers but wished to do so if possible. His question was whether it was operationally desirable on our part, which I answered saying it would be XXX (after talking with Mr. Heyn). Actually, there is no strong advantage, but at least it should be started sometime, and there is no advantage to us in having her remain a Costa Rican since she will be an American citizen at sore date in the future.

2.  When HUMANOID left on his vacation, it was understood that I would be checking with Mr. Heyn about the means by which his wife might be able to start her papers while HUMANOID is in training at Headquarters. My understanding is that she would have to leave the country and reenter as an immigrant quota since she is presently on a tourist visa and cannot as such apply for citizenship even if her husband in a U.S. citizen.

3.  Mr. Heyn informed me that there is a section which handled these questions of citizenship for people we are interested in, and said he would be checking with that person. I told HUM NOID that the next person who handled him would be able to give him further details on this whole matter.

4.  I would recommend that HUMANOID be given all help possible to have his wife started on her papers before they go our under BIFADIAL, since they will be gone for two years at a minimum and will be delaying her citizenship that much longer if nothing is started while they are here in the country.

Decided not to try for
30 day citizenship due
to Cover Problems

Wife would have to
return Costa Rica and
re-enter U.S. anyway.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Interview with Arthur G. VAIVADA

1.  On 9 September 1953 subject was again contacted at his apartment and the new contract was signed. Subject was told that the contract clause dealing with additional commitments not included in the contract was standard agency protection against unauthorized promises by persons contacting him, such as the case officer. He was told, however, that the case officer's personal experience has been that the agency makes all possible efforts to act in good faith and with common sense if contract problems arise at a later date.

2.  The "offset"provisions of the contract was explained, emphasizing the agency's view that any future cover business activity on his part would be possible only because of the salary we pay. Therefor, modest profits, if any, would be offset against salary due to him. It was pointed out that the case officer's understanding was that if subject's diligence resulted in sizable profits, the agency would probably consider revising the contract to allow subject a share of the profits. However, subject agreed that this question was really subordinate to the main purpose of a cover activity, which would be to obtain cover, not profits.

NOTE: Subject's questions appeared motivated by the contract form, which was more complicated and "legalistic" in appearance than the new written in the field under which he has been operating for the past four years. His attitude at all times was most cooperative, and he agreed that the spirit in which the contract was carried out, on both sides, was as important as the provisions. It was carefully explained to him that the contract served the double purpose of defining the rights and obligations of both himself and the agency, and for that reason may at points seem more "legalistic" than regularly necessary. However, subject stated several times that he had had nothing but the best of relations with the persons who have directed him so far, and it is the case officer's opinion that he has the utmost faith in the good intentions of the agency.

3.  Subject was informed that "Career" status, in which he has expressed interest over the past two years, would be considered at the end of the present two year contract, and would depend on his operational success during that period and his ability to provide durable cover which would enable hi to continue working for us.

4.  The subject's travel reimbursement is being handled by Hanke (x3504), and will be ready for him when he returns to Washington on or about 2 October. Subject went on vacation effective 10 September and will be at the following addresses during his vacation:

September 10-14: Fran Williams

September 15-25: Mr. L. E. Crozier

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE

SUBJECT: Interview with Arthur G. VAIVADA

1. On 28 August 1953, Arthur G. VAIVADA was contacted at a hotel in Washington, D.C., by the Costa Rican desk officer. Subject was briefed on the necessity of submitting an accounting of travel expenses and given the outlines of his training schedule. He also signed a pseudonym acknowledgement. In addition, subject was given his full August salary of $250 (old rate), although it developed that he had been given a half months' salary by the station prior to departure. He was told this overpayment would be subtracted from his travel reimbursement.

2. On the night of 30 August 1953, subject was contacted at his apartment in Virginia. He requested our opinion as to the possibility of his wife's starting to take out citizenship papers now prior to departing for Argentina, and the desirability of this for cover reasons. He was told that the agency would probably not object (he would be given a definite answere in the near future), but that it right not be possible anyway since his wife was on a tourist visa. (This answer was also promised soon.) He was told that the new contract to te signed could not give either life of hospitalisation insurance, for reasons of cover. He was told that career agent status, which would be considered at the end of the two year contract to be signed shortly, would allow life insurance, but not hospitalization. It was explained to him thet his present contract did not acknowledge him to be a U.S. Government employee, but that career agent status would grant that.

NOTE: At all times the subject impressed the case officer with sincerity, willingness to abide by agency decisions in all matters, and showed a most cooperative attitude.

3. Subject made the following points while discussing his Argentina assignment:

a. His application for entrance to Argentina as a student is now in the hands of the Argentine Consul in Costa Rica. It should te granted in three months. He does not forsee any problems in this respect, cut did ask what our plans would be if any thing did prevent his going there. He was told that we would attempt to place him elsevere, but that this was a contingency we couldn't make any plans about until something prevented his present assignment.

b. Subject will keep in touch with the Argentine Consul through a friend ir. Ohio who will handle incoring and outgoing mail. This address has been given to the Consul. He believes that this offers no security problem, since the friend is an officer in the Air Force the briefs outgoing military attaches at Wright Field and as such has a full security clearance. This friend is witting of subjectis activities to the extent that he knows subject to be working partire for the U.S. Government in some sort of assignment. Subject's friend will be cautioned in this respect.

c. Subject has told his parents that he is studying at MIT for awhile before deciding where to complete his studies. Communication through them will be through a frierl at T on whom he submitted FRQ data when this friend was in San Jose earlier this year. (A security clearance request has been rade by HD/III). Subject's friend is also witting to a certain extent since he gave very general inforzation when obtaining the FRQ data. For personal reasons to do with his marriage to a Costa Rican, there is no chance that his family in Ilinois would make any sort of a trip to see him.

Security Information

d. Subject will use a cover story while in Weshington that he is studying at George Washington University in the field of Economics.

d. Subject's wife has a clsoe friend in Argentine who is married to an Argentine army sergeant. Her nore is Alicia Castro de CRUZ, 25 de l'ayo #5327, l'ar del Plata, Argentina. This name has been given to the Argentine Corsul es a charecter reference.

f. Subject has 6-7 months of GI bill eligibility left for Argentine studies.

g. Due to the fact that subject's wife has been witting of his general activities, it was carefully explained him that the agency had certain reservetions considering this point. Emphasis was put on the point that good operational security practices in his future assignment would be of extreme importance for obvicus reasons. It was pointed out that this interir period in Washington vould te an ideal time to sererete his activites from home life since his wife would no longer be in a community where she and her husband were well known. He was frank in admitting that he realized the dangers also, and would cooperate to the fullesteatent.

NOTE: Subject is sensible in his aprreech to security and appears to think through each problem on its own serits. The extent of his wife's knowledge was to know that he was "going out to (a section of San Jose) for business reasons". She wes . wit' ing of his conrection with Communist activites, since on several occasions she was able to contact persons when it was not suitable for him to do so. At no time has she pressed him for information, and his general feeling is that she should be told only enough to explain urdue al sences from home. He was cautioned that his future superiors whold take a dim view of his wife's perticizetion, even to the limited extent he has indicated did occur in the past. He agreed that being in a new community with no local friends of long standing would make tissit easier for them io start on this new basis.

It is the case officer's opinion that subject has carefully controlled his fife's knowledge and acted prudently in matters involving security. His operational achievements are evidence that his security practises have been sound, and it is believed that four years of covert contact with a well-known Communist in San Jose with no security breaches are sufficient proof of his wife's security consciousness.

KIYORANEXJK FOR THE CHIEF OF FOREIGA INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: Project EIRADIAL

5 August 1953

1.  The purpose of this project is to provide for the covert training and transfer of a contract agent from Costa Rica to Argentina, where the latter will develop penetrations of the Communist Party of Argentina (PCA) and Communist front organizations and perform support functions as assigned.

2.  BIRADIAL, an American citizen born in Mlinois in 1922, is married to a Costa Rican girl and has two small children. Since June 1949 he has worked for CIA, under the cryptonym HUMANOID, in Costa Rica as a contract agent. He has proven himself particuairly adept at spotting and recruiting agents and has successfully supervised the direction of a high-level Communist Party penetration agent.

3.  The agent has been accepted as a student at the University of Buenos Aires for the school year beginning March 1954. He will try to establish himself in the photography business, in which he is well-qualified and has had previous experience, as an ostensible means to make ends meet while completing his studies.

4.  Contact and communications between BIRADIAL and his case officer will be clandestine, under pretexts still to be arranged. Communications betsean the former and any agents or sources he recruits will be arranged according to the circumstances.

5.  BIRADIAL has been dependent upon this Agency for the past four years, which financial dependence has increased considerably over this period with the increase of his family. His motivation is patriotic, and his past actions and achievements have borne this out.

6.  The estimated annual cost of this project is $5,705 salary and allowances (GS-7), $3,550 travel and per diem (to U.S. for covert training, leave and return to Argentina), $500 transportation of effects and $720 for operational expenses and travel, a total of $10,475.

7.  WH requests approval of Project BIRADIAL for the period 1 Angust 1953 through 31 July 1954.

STATION Buenos Aires Date 1 August 1953

1.  The attached project is presented for approval.

2.  Project BIADIAL concerns the transfer of Contract Agent HUMANOID from Costa Rica to Argentina, with interim training at headquarters. Upon approval of this project, HUMANOID will henceforth be known as BRADIAL.

3.  Since 1949, BIRADIAL, a native-born American, has been the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station. He successfully directed and exploited a high-level penetration of the Communist Party of Costa Rica. Among other accomplishments, he recruited two rail intercept agents, processing the take himself, and has recruited three additional agents presently being used; he also set up safe-houses and was in charge of the monitoring post in a technical surveillance. In the latter instance, his quick thinking in removing the equipment prevented its discovery, when the operation was blown due to circumstances unrelated to his handling of the operation. More recently, BRADIAL personally entered the Communist Party headquarters surreptitiously during the Hay Day celebration and carried off more than 75% of their official records. His case officers have been impressed with his initiative, security-mindedness, and ability to exercise good judgement under operational stress. BIRADIAL's transfer from Costa Rica to another area has become necessary due to the expiration of his cover status as a student there.

4.  BIRADIAL has already created his cover for the first year of his new assignment in Buenos Aires, having been accepted as a student at the University of Buenos Aires for the term beginning March 1954. During this period he will develop a small photographic business, in which he has had professional experience, to cover his activities in Argentina after completing his university studies. No funds for this purpose will be required from this Agency.

The project's objectives are the development of penetrations of the Communist Party of Argentina (FCA), its front organizations and

SEGRET

Security Information

to develop information on penetration of government circles.
BIRADIAL will perform cutout duties as assigned by the Chief of Mission.

5. The estimated cost of this project for the first year is $10,475.00. This includes: salary of $4205 (CS-7 level) plus allowances of $1500; operational travel $120; operational expenses $600; the balance of $4050 comprises $2650 for the travel of BIRADIAL, his wife and two children from Costa Rica to the United States and thence to Argentina; $500 for the transportation of personal effects either from Costa Rica or the United States to Argentina; and $900 for per diem while in travel status and during training at headquarters. Subject is selling most of his personal effects in Costa Rica. The normal annual cost of this project therefore, would be $6425.

6. BIRADIAL will be permitted to take one month of leave with pay, before entering training. He justly deserves this consideration. While in training a new contract will be signed with BERADIAL embodying the features outlined in paragraph 5.

7. Since it is urgent for the preservation of BIRADIAL's cover that this project be implemented as soon as possible, it is requested that the effective date be 1 August 1953.

PROJECT OUTLINE

CRYPTONY: BIRADIAL

Part I

1. Area of Operations:

Buenos Aires, Argentina.

2. References:

Project HUMANOID. The contract agent HUMANOID will become BIRADIAL in this new project through which he will be transferred from Costa Rica to Argentina.

BUEN 734 (DI 45639).

3. Purpose:

a. Objectives:

To bring to Washington for training and transfer from Costa Rica to Argentina a Contract Agent for the purpose of developing penetrations of the Communist Party of Argentina (PCA), and Communist front organizations, and to perform cutout duties as assigned.

b. Targets:

The Argentine Communist Party (PCA); Communist student and intellectual circles; Communist labor groups; PCA penetration of government circles.

c. Tasks:

To gather pertinent data from all available sources on leading Communists and their associates.

4. Personnel:

a. Pseudonyms or cryptonyms:

The project initially will involve the use of BIRADIAL, only. It will be amended as sub-agents are added subsequently.

b. Personal data:

BIRADIAL is an American citizen born in Illinois in 1922,
who is married to a Costa Rican and has two small children.
He spent approximately 5 years doing U.S. Air Force intel-
ligence work in the CBI and Carribean Theatres. Since June
1949 he has worked for KUBARK in Costa Rica as a Contract
Agent under student cover. ile is particularly adept at
spotting and recruiting agents and has successfully super-
vised the direction of a high-level Communist Party
penetration agent.

5. Cover:

a. Clandestine contact will be arranged between the agent and
the case officer. In view of the sensitive nature of his
objectives and the modest position he is likely to occupy
in the American community in Buenos Aires, it is regarded
as inconsistent and insecure for BIRADIAL to enter into a
social relationship with his case officer.

b. Subject has been accepted as a student at the University of
Buenos Aires for the school year beginning March 1954.
Having a wife and two children he will try to establish him-
self in the photographic business, ostensibly to make ends
meet while completing his studies. He is qualified and has
had experience in this business before. By the time his
studies are completed (in about one year) he proposes to
have developed his photographic business sufficiently to
provide adequate cover, justifying his remaining in Argentina.

6. Contact and Communications:

a. The case officer will contact BIRADIAL directly to provide
him with direction and collect his reports. Both are native-
born Americans. Contacts will be clandestine upon pretexts
still to be arranged.

b. Any sub-agents subsequently recruited also will be contacted
clandestinely. They will be confined to persons within the
normal social and business strata of BRADIAL.

c. No special problems of contact and communication are anti-
cipated.

7. Control:

a. Subject has been dependent upon this Agency for the past four

years. The degree of financial dependence has increased considerably over this period with the increase in his family. The necessity to meet these responsibilities assure his readiness to comply with all directions to protect his job.

b. Subject is motivated by a sincere patriotic desire to render valuable service to his country. lis aggressive attitude toward his work and the initiative he has summoned in pursuance of the tasks assigned to him have constantly borne evidence of his devotion to the protection of American ideals and interests..

8. Special Equipment:

None.

9. Coordination:

Coordination with the Costa Rican Desk and Headquarters Covert Training will be effected.

10. Timetable:

The project can be activated upon approval. For the preservation of BIRADIAL's cover it is important that the project be implemented as soon after 1 August 1953 as possible. On that date Subject must move from his home in Costa Rica, and should then travel to the United States, since his studies and work in San Jose have been terminated.

Duration of the project: indefinite.

Part II

11. Estimated Cost:

The following is an estimate of the cost for the FY 1954. (Subsequent fiscal years will show a smaller cost ratio, since the transportation of BIRADIAL and his family from Costa Rica to the United States for training and subsequent travel to Argentina will not re-occur.):

1. Transmitted herewith is the HUMANOID file, which, through a regrettable inadvertence, was not forwarded to your station sooner. After perusal by your station, it is requested that the file be returned to San José for use in briefing the incoming Chief of Station on the over-all scope and ramifications of these activities formerly handled by subject which will be reassigned upon HUMANOID's departure.

2. In view of the fact that subject has sold his house and furniture and must effect delivery on 31 July 1953, and because a tentative departure date of 1 August 1953 has been set, your early attention to reference would be greatly appreciated.

3. The HUMANOID file will be returned to Buenos Aires for permanent retention after it has served the purpose set forth in Paragraph 1.

HUMANOID

REFERENCE: DIR 09060

1.  Reference cable proposed subject for your consideration as a contract agent, in which capacity he has already served. KE most ably during the past four years in Costa Rica. The San Jose Station was requested to forward subject's file for your perusal; we hope that you are now in receipt of this file.

2.  This dispatch has the purpose of presenting to you Headquarters' appraisal of HUMANOID. A review of the Headquarters file indicates that HUMANOID is an aggressive, rather well qualified operative, who has enjoyed a good measure of success and has exercised good judgment under operational stress. He desires a career with this Agency, and is devoted to the work. Subject's academic education has been designed to fit him to become an economist. Prior to entering a contract relationship with EUBARK, subject had received U. S. Army intelligence training and had worked for Air Force Intelligence in Panama.

3.  There follows a summary and appraisal of HUMANOID's work which has been provided by the Headquarters Costa Rican Desk.

    a.  HUMANOID was recruited by the Panama station in November 1948, but in early 1949 he moved to San Jose, Costa Rica, where he enrolled in the University of Costa Rica as a student of economics. In June 1949 Project HUMANOID was activated, with subject handling and acting as cutout for two mail intercept agents and a low level penetration of the Communist Party. In October 1949 a very high-level penetration of the Communist Party was also turned over to the subject, who was

by this time devoting approdrately half his time to ar work. Since that time HUMANOID'S zain cuties have been to act as cutout and direct those apunts, with the exception of the low level pene- tration who was dropped in aid-1952. HONANOID's most important single activity has been in debriefing the hih-level penetration agent who ho has been ablo to develop to a polut where HUMANOID and this one agent constituto the most imortant assets of the station.

b. In the course of his operational cuties, subject has proved himself to be very security conecicus and to possess a degree of initiative which hae Lanresced the station chief on more thaл опо оссавіon. He has participated in setting up cafehouses, was responsible for recruiting the two nail intercept arents, and has provided the facilities for photographing the material these two arents turn over to bia for rapid processing and return to normal mail chunnala. Subject has reerited two additional arente, both of whon are presently being ured, and carried out a cold recruitment atterpt on a Covunist which is still reading. A participated in a tocinical sur voillance operation in early 1951 during which he was in charge of the nonitoring post toother with an indigenous agent under his direction. The operation was blown after a short time due to cir cumstances beyond his control, switch had no relation, to the operation itself or the way in which he ran it. Extensive checking cubsequently showed that he was not compraised and that his quick action prevented any discovery of the technical surveillance equipment itself. kost recently, MURANOID surreptitiovaly entered the Cocmanist Party head quarters in Costa Rica on Hay Day and carried off over 75% of the official records of the Party.

c. Subjoet is an expert photorrapher and at one time operated his om photography shop in San Jose. He is also fairly proficient in send- ing Morse code, is trained in the use of firoaras, and has studied and worked with charts and maps. No ves trained in jungle warfare during eleven mantas in the col theater during the last war whiم with the Air Force. He is considered expert in writing reparts. Subject has proved himself to to knowledgeable in the usual techniques of covert operations after four years of working in San Jose, and las proved to be invaluable to the station in spotting and/or recruiting additional agente.

d. HUMANOID is married to a Costa Rican woman and has two children. His wife is conizant of his intelliſence activities, and has sided his on several occasions. There are no indications that she has in any way comprondsed his security.

e. The question of a career status was discussed with subject over a year ago when he was in touch with the former chief of station now at Headquarters, but no commitments were made in this record, although he was told that it would be considered, depending on his future activities. He indicated his willingness to continue his operational activities in any other country when his course of studies ended in March 1953 at the University of Costa Rica. He is presently accepted for the March 1954 class at the University of Buenos Aires where he hopes to get his BS in Economics. He has discussed the question of covert training at Headquarters some time in late 1953 prior to going to Argentina. It is Headquarters' understanding that he would come to Headquarters some time in late August or September for approximately two months covert training, after which he might be directed to await departure for Argentina until some time in mid-January 1954 in order not to arrive in the area too long before his schooling starts.

f. Additional personal information on subject will be found in the San Jose Station file.

4. HUMANOID appears to be a promising prospect for consideration as one of the individuals to be introduced into Argentina under unofficial cover, in accordance with Country Plan objectives. Should you find his qualifications of interest and favor his entry into Argentina as a Mission asset, please advise as early as possible, in order that necessary travel details and training schedules can be arranged at Headquarters. In view of the higher standard of living in Buenos Aires and subject's excellent record of service, an amendment of his present contract would be effected while he is in Washington. Our present thinking is in terms of annual compensation at GS-7 level ($4205). An American student with a wife and two children will probably discover this amount to be none too ample to maintain a normal standard of living. Your comments and suggestions will be appreciated, particularly with regard to any allowances that would be appropriate.

5. An early reply would be especially helpful, since HUMANOID has already remained in Costa Rica three months beyond the date of completion of his studies and should leave there by August. (He was requested by the San Jose Station to remain through July to cover the impending elections.) We shall await your reply pending any further action regarding HUMANOID.

SUBJECT: GENERAL- Operational

SPECIFIC- Security Review of Current Operations
Project HUMANOID

Ref: TRSW-816

1. The following comments on reference are submitted for your information and files. It is to be noted that the headquarters reviewing officials have arrived at a number of the same conclusions that we have with regard to the security of the Project and the possible lines of action to be followed.

2. With regard to Paragraph 6 of reference, we feel that although the security risk of contact and communications between HUMANOID and HUMANOID-3 has not been removed, it has been reasonably minimized. After the closing of HUMANOID's photo shop in November, 1951, several meetings were carried out at night on park benches while attempts were being made to locate a secure safehouse. This method was not satisfactory because of the impossibility of handling and discussing written materials, the brief time limit demanded, and the possibility of accidental recognition of one or the other. A number of meetings were held at the home of HUMANOID at night with pre-arranged safety-danger signals. Although the obvious security hazards here were aggravated by the fact that a Communist Party sympathizer lives in the neighborhood, the risks were deemed less serious than park meetings. A safe house was located in May, 1952, and was used for several meetings, but was compromised and abandoned when several school acquaintances of HUMANOID passed by and saw him unlocking the front door. Meetings were again held at the home of HUMANOID on a staggered schedule while search for suitable safehouses continued. (At least ten apartments and offices were examined and rejected by HUMANOID and the writer during this period.) A new safehouse was rented on 1 November, 1952, and is presently being used for meetings. However, both HUMANOID and HUMANOID-3 have agreed to abandon this place at the end of the month, because actual use has demonstrated security weaknesses in exit and entry. Another safe office is presently under investigation, and attempts have been made to limit the live contacts by brush meetings in darkened streets and use of a post office box for non-sensitive reports. We are also actively searching for suitable two-way dead drop facilities in a further effort to minimize live contacts.

3. With regard to Paragraph 7 of reference, it is to be noted that HUMANOID's relations with the Diroctor of the Post Office have been strengthened considerably in recent months. The Director has been outspokenly anti-Communist in several long discussions and has referred once or twice to the fact that his personal war against the local Communists, 1.0., interception and confiscation of Communist propaganda, appears to go unrecognized by the Costa Rican government. Ho intimated that he is more aware of the dangers presented by Communist activitios than are the security a thoritios. We feel confident that no Costa Rican officials are actively attempting to identify higher elements in the net, control the operation, or dotect the nature of our intelligence interests. The Director's personal consorship mounts to little more than confis- cating obvious Communist proparanda (most of which is turned over to us in bulk) and opening lettors for perusal. He has no facilities for copying such letters and maintains no files of past correspondence. The Chief of the Costa Rican Intolligence Service is well known to us and on the rara cccasions when ho requests the Director to intercept a letter we hear of it from either the Director or HUMANOID-2.

4. In view of the dovolopment of more intimate relations between HUMANOID and the Director and the latter's interest in whether any record exists of his cooperation in anti-Communist activities, we have obtained preliminary PRO data from him and are presently con- sidering the possibility of roquesting clearance as a paid aent. This will be the subject of a future dispatch. Further indication of the lack of detailed information on the part of the Costa Rican authorities concerning this project is contained in TRSA-1272.

5. With regard to Paragraph 8 of reforonce dispatch, we have long been concerned over the lack of additional cutouts and the scope of responsibilitics presently assigned to HUMANOID. We hope to separate the mail intercept and the Vanguardia Poplar operations in the near future. As previously reported, the possibility exists that *HUMANOID will depart Costa Rica some time during 1953. We have already begun turning over the postal intercept activity to HUMIST. When clearance is obtained for HUMORESCUE, and further observation is completed, we contemplate turning HUMANOID-3 over to HUMORESQUE. In addition, we are gathering PRO deta on additional potential cutouts.

6. With regard to Paragraph 9 of reference, it is to be noted that we were in the process of developing cordial relations with Major Jorge PACHECO as an Erabassy officer concerned with visa security risks, international travel of Communists, arms sauggling from the U.S., etc. PACHECO resigned as Chief of Detectives some sonths ago and is not presently connected with the government. We have main- tained friendly relations with him, however, on the possibility that ho may again at some future date return to a responsible position.

7. Concerning Para raph 10 of refereme, it is to be noted that HUMANOID will quite likely depart Costa Rica during 1953,

thereby eliminating the security aspects of the fact that his intelligence activitios are known to a wide circle of indigenous agents. The Director of the Post office is under consideration for recruitment as a paid agent. It is not believed that subject's wife represents a security hazard. Our limited observation of her indicetes that she is discreet, a conclusion which is strengthened by the fact that no security breeches have occurred as a result of her generalized awareness of HUMANOID's intelligence activitios. It is expected that she will apply for U.S. eitizenship in the rear future.

8. Headquarters' recommendation that HUMANOID exercise extreme cantion in all of his intelligence activities will be followed. The diagram attached to reference is acurate with the one addition that HUMIST is cognizant of the postal intercept activity. During this developmontal period, HUMANOID has been acting as a cutout betweon HUMIST and the Chief of Station. In the near future direct contact will be established between HUIST and the Chief of Station, and HUMANOID withdrawn from this activity..

9. We appreciate the exhaustive review of this project prepared by headquarters. It is our desire to keep headquarters promptly informed of all minor details as well as major developments. However, we frequently find in the sifting and evaluation of those matters demanding attention at any given time that either routine reporting or current operations must suffer.

1. As indicated in references, subject travelled to Washington in early November, 1952, on personal business and contacted Elmer C. Mercer upon arrival in order to discuss the possibilities of a future assignment in another Latin American country. After discussion with WHD officers, according to subject, Mercer indicated that reassignment to another country would be considered. An assignment in Argentina was tentatively discussed with the understanding that subject must arrange his cover personally and his departure from San José must have our concurrence. It was also mentioned that subject might be afforded approximately three months training in Washington prior to departure for Argentina, and that a new contract would be prepared.

2. Since his return to San José, subject has ascertained that he can transfer to the School of Economic Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, in order to obtain his B.S. degree. He has approximately one more year of schooling before cbtaining his degree. Contact with the Argentine Consul indicated no difficulties would be encountered in making the transfer or obtaining a visa and that job opportunities in the photographic field are favorable.

3. In view of the fact that subject's services will be needed here for the remainder of the presidential electoral campaign, it will be mid-July before he can be released. Subject is aware of this time consideration and is planning to enter the University of Buenos Aires at the beginning of the school year in March, 1954. This tentative schedule will permit a few months training in Washington subsequent to July, 1953, and will also permit a period of a few months orientation in Argentina prior to the start of the school year.

4. Headquarters comments are requested on the above matter as well as information as to what commitments, if any, were made to subject while in Washington. Subject states it will be necessary to take his wife and two children to the U.S. with him if training is required. His wife is planning to apply for U.S. citizenship.

DATE: 16 JUN 1953

Ref: HRSW-106

1. Headquarters attention is invited to Project HERRLIANT which has as its objective the recruitment of a party member or the introduction of a new member into the Communist Party in the Cuopos area. HUMILIANT-2 has made some progress in this regard, having been accepted in the Communist syndicate and having widened his circle of Communist acquaintances in the area. This project is expected to produce a low-level, long-term penetration of the party in one of the most critical labor areas of Costa Rica.

2. HUMANOID has recently been instructed to canvass the lists of second and third echelon Communists and sympathizers in the San José area for possible defectors. Heretofore, most of the station's attention has been directed towards members of the Political Commission with negative results. However, a review of available operational data on the top leaders is once again being made with the likelihood that HUMANOID will be used for at least one approach immediately prior to his departure. This approach will be in addition to the search for a second-string recruitment. Also, an effort is being made to locate an appropriate individual who will be instructed to join the party as a new member. On 6 June 1953 another contact was had with the subject of AREA-95 with negative results.

3. Any penetration of the Communist Party is the same as a penetration of the PFI as the actual leadership is almost identical. We are hopeful that KUOOWN efforts will result in the PFI being declared illegal this week.

4. No specific plans have been made as yet for HUMIDOR's use in the labor field except that we are considering the possibility

Memo to Janes K. Russo re Departure Lotable for CANDID

Certain circumstances surrounding my application for residence in Argentina through thoir Labessy here in San Jost have given rise to a suggestion in roicronce to my tiactable for departure. Originally it was agreed by all concerned that a departure shortly after the local elections (say 1 August 1953) would be most convenient for the station. There was some questica as to aceeptance at the University of Buenos Aires, bat it was lator decided that a moro direct assurance of ontry could be arranged by actual application for resident status right here at San Jose. This process was begun immediately. Subsequent conversations with Russo, however, have given me the impression that headquarters will await the approval of the resident perait before arranging my čeparture for the U.S.

Actually there have been no unusual obstacles encountered in the routine preparation of documentation, but nevertheless, the Argentine Consul assures me that "roselts will not be fortheo ing in less than three months." Accordingly, this would place the most optimistic results some time in late Soptember.

Meanwhile, for rather urgent personal reasons, I am anxious that my departure for the U.S. be realized as per the original understanding, that is, shortly after the local elections. By this plan, correspondence can bo maintained with the Argontine Embassy here at San Jond as concorns the arrival... of the documentation, and my proposed training period can con- ceivably be accomplished within this interval of time. If the resident permit is denied, or the delay unusually great, an alternate aroa might then be considered..

I fully comprehend the uncertaintics involved in making such a departure without the residence at the future station positively established and as prepared to enter and work in any area selected at the discretion of the organization. What I an trying to avoid cost of all is a possible interim waiting period of several months in a more or less casual status. If such is inevitable, then let it take place Stateside!

HEADQUARTERS CASE OFFICER:

Room No. 2218
Extension 2065
Date 6 February 1953

1. The attached Revised Project Outline is submitted for renewal effective 1 March 1953 to 28 February 1954.

2. This project encompasses all the agents presently used by the Station. The principal agent HUMANOID has demonstrated particular ability in closely directing sub-agents to realize their full potentialities. He has also provided the Station with valuable background data on the personalities and political movements with the country, in addition to his assigned objectives.

3. Reports have been factual, the information can usually be relied upon, and all information is of operational value. Security practices have been sound, though hampered by the problem of procuring a safehouse which is permanently secure.

4. The departure of the principal agent from Costa Rica sometime after the 26 July 1953 presidential elections will necessitate re-assigning cut-out duties to HUMIST and also to HUMORESQUE when the latter is cleared. At the present time HUMIST is gradually assuming full responsibility as cut-out for HUMANOID-1 and HUMANOID-2. The two agents who will assure HUMANOID'a present cut-out and debriefing functions will be thoroughly familiar with their duties by the time HUMANOID leaves.

5. It is anticipated that at about mid-year this project will be re-submitted as two separate projects. In the meantime, however, it seems advisable to request renewal for a full year.

6. Attached is a list of the dispatches and disseminations based on information provided by the principal agent and sub-agents. Of the 118 reports submitted, 91 were used in 86 disseminations.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 199

Security Information

C. Tasks:

This project conforms to the tasks assigned to the San Jose Station in SOI of 19 August 1952, 2a, 2b, and 2c.

4. Personnel:

a. This project, in addition to HUMANOID, involves the following agents:

HUMANOID-1
HUMANOID-2
HUMANOID-3
HUMIST

b. HUMANOID is an American citizen born in 1922 in Illinois. Subject spent approximately five years doing general Air Force Intelligence work after joining the U.S. Air Force in April 1946. Subject is presently living in San Jose, where he has been until recently attending school. Since June 1949, when project HUMANOID was first activated, subject has been the most valuable single agent of the San Jose Station.

HUMANOID-1 is a Costa Rican, employed in the post office in San Jose.
HUMANOID-2 is a Costa Rican, employed in the post office in San Jose.
HUMANOID-3 is a Costa Rican, and member of the Vanguardia Popular. He has provided consistent high-level information on Communist activities by virtue of his position in the Party. HUMIST is a naturalized American born in Germany, who is self-employed and has lived in San Jose since 1947, after serving in the U.S. Army as an interpreter in a P.W. camp in Virginia.

5. Cover:

a. Case officer in contact with HUMANOID: Normal social contact of Americans.

b. By the agent performing his operational tasks: Subject is established in San Jose on a purely personal basis with no apparent connection with the San Jose Station. He is a home owner, married, and a fully accepted member of the community on that basis. He has been attending school in San Jose, but has recently resigned in preparation for his eventual departure from Costa Rica after the July presidential elections to attend school elsewhere. (See Timetable.)

6. Contact and Communication:

a. Case officer and HUMANOID have weekly appointments which are held in many places of natural communication between Americans.

b. HUMANOID and the following:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 200

Security Information

(1) HUMANOID-1 and 2: Mail intercepts by these two agents are deposited in an envelope and placed in a post office box. It is removed by HUMANOID who transmits it to the case officer, the material being returned to HUMANOID for replacing in the post office box after being photographed in the office of the Chief of Station.

(2) HUMANOID-3: A safehouse in use since May 1952 is presently being used. Due to certain security weaknesses in exit and entry, it will be terminated at the end of January 1953. Another safehouse is presently under development, as well as a two-way dead drop and post office box to minimize live contacts.

(3) HUMIST: Normal social contact between Americans.

c. A safehouse is indispensable to debrief HUMANOID-3, who has to report on Communist meetings which are often over 3 hours long. Three safehouses have had to be abandoned due to demonstrated weaknesses, but the new safehouse should prove satisfactory.

7. Control:

a. The control of HUMANOLD is based upon his past service record with the U.S. Government, demonstrated loyalty, and judgment of the present and former Chiefs of Station. In addition HUMANOID is a U.S. citizen, and at present depends almost wholy on the financial assistance he receives for the performance of his duties.

b. The control of HUMANOID-1 and 2 is based upon the threat of exposure to the government. Motivation is the generally anti-Communist nature of their work and the financial gain from their duties.

c. Control over HUMANOID-3 consists of signed receipts, reports, etc., which could be used as a threat. However, the agent's high regard for his salary and developing personal friendship with HUMANOID are motivating factors.

8. Special Equipment:

No special equipment is involved at the present time.

9. Coordination: This project was originally initiated with the co-operation of the Panama Station. Continued coordination with Panama, or any other station, is not considered necessary or desirable.

10. Timetable: HUMANOID was engaged by the San Jose Station in June 1949 and has been a most satisfactory agent since inception. Ho is presently planning to leave San Jose, having completed his studies at the university, but has agreed to remain until after the presidential elections on 26 July 1953. When he leaves, his cut-out duties for HUMANOID-1 and 2, which are presently being gradually turned over to HUMIST, will be taken over by HUMIST, who will then have direct contact with the case officer on much the same basis as HUMANOID. By that time, HUMORESCUE should have operation clearance to act as an American cut-out for HUMANOID-3.

12. Special Problems or Commitments: HUMANOID is interested in making a career in the intelligence field, and has demonstrated willingness to continue this work in Argentina. While in the United States in the fall of 1952, he talked with the former chief of the San Jose Station, now at Headquarters, and was told that in the event of his removal to Argentina for further schooling, he would be continued on his present salary as a minimum. He was also advised to request covert training in the United States preparatory to going to Argentina, and was told that at the time of that request it would be up to Headquarters to determine the advisability of paying any part of transportation for himself and family to the United States and from there to Argentina.

MEMORANDU! FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT : Humanoid

1. At the request of Ur. Caldwell, I met with humarmid on the occasion of his visit to Washington last November and made certain oral commitments on behalf of the Division. No commitment, however, was very specific and all were cleared with the Division in advance. My participation in the matter was, of course, owing to the fact that I had recruited Humanoid originally and enjoy his confidence.

2. Humanoid in the past has pursued his activities on behalf of this organization as somewhat of a profitable avocation. His performance, nonetheless, has been outstanding from the point of view of initiative, production and understanding of operational principles. He would now like to make it a career but lacks sufficient information upon which to base a decision and, being partially aware of the uncertainties involved, insists upon maintaining an alternate vocation. In pursuit of this latter objective, he plans to move to Buenos Aires in June or July of 1953 and establish himself there on a permanent basis. His inquiries were to ascertain what effect these plans would have upon his present and future relationship with this organization.

3. I advised Humanoid to continue with his plans as outlined above, stipulating only that he remain in his present location until after the forthcoming elections and assured in that as a consequence of his past satisfactory service he would be picked up in Buenos Aires at a compensation at least equal to that which re is presently receiving.

4. I then explained that our participation in his move would necessarily have to be determined at a later date but requested him to keep us informed of his plans on a continuing basis, assuring him that it would do no harm to request such assistance as he might need. In this connection, I advised him to request formal training, which he has never had, implying that this would be granted, and suggested that a formal contract, future compensation, travel expense and so forth could best be negotiated here at that time.

5. I recommend, therefore, that Humanoid be brought to headquarters for a period of training and that a contract agent relationship containing the usual travel and allowance provisions be formalized at that time. Basic compensation should certainly consider his past record and proven reliability in addition to the initiative he has shown in laying on his our cover. Although his future assigment is none of my business, I would point out that he has proven adept at spotting, recruiting aini agent handling and suggest that his talents would be greatly circumscribed if assigned to direct exploitation of a specific target.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW

HRSA-56

COUNTRY: Costa Rica
CRYPTONYM:: HUMANOID
OBJECTIVES AND TASKS: PERIOD: May 1 to December 31, 1952.
SALARY: No change.

$1,600 per month effective March 1
1952, per DIR 17384.
EVALUATION OF SERVICES: Excellent and of major importance to this station.
EVALUATION OF INFORMATION: Of considerable value with reference tc. information produced through sub- agents. During the period under review, agent has done independent reporting and has produced several reports of value on political matters and has contributed useful operational background data.

OTEER FACTORS: The removal of operational restric- tions on agent's activities during this period has permitted fuller use of his capabilities, i.e., increased spotting and recruiting activities..

COMMENTS: Operation of this project was greatly enhanced by the salary raise which was effective in March, 1952. Subject has resigned his position with the School of Agronomy and is now able to devote more time to our interests as as result of the betterment of his financial status. In November Agent travelled to the United States and contacted Elmer C. Mercer, former Chief of Station, San José, at which time the possibilitics of reassignment to another Latin American country were discussed. After discussion with WHD officers, Mercer advised HUMANOID A RLASSIGNMENT WOULD BE CONSIDERED. (This matter is being covered in dispatch form).

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, BRANCH III
SUBJECT: HUMANOID

1.  Attached hereto is a letter received from HUMANOID by Mr. Edward A. Harelius, now at Headquarters and the former Chief of Station at Costa Rica, who recruited HUMANOID.

2.  Particular reference is made to Paragraph 6 regarding a change in assignment. Mr. Marelius thinks that when subject finishes his school year in 1953 he should be brought to Headquarters for training, and that he should be converted to Staff Agent for possible reassignment in Latin America under deep cover. Mr. Marelius thinks that HUMANOID will go stale in San Jose and that a change should be made to better utilize his services. Although subject is the principal source in Costa Rica, he feels that arrangements could be made for an orderly turn-over and departure.

3.  While I was assigned in Panama I met subject, at which time he was contemplating moving to Panama, attending the University, and working for the Panama station. He impressed me very well and would have been quite an asset, but the deal fell through due to the higher cost of living in Panama and the fact that he would lose considerable credits in transferring.

4.  I do not know whether it can be worked out but I certainly would go along with recommending that he be afforded training in the U.S. and that he be reassigned, preferably to Argentina or one of the other countries where the is urgent needed for additional unofficial cover. The question of his converting to Staff Agent might be worked out also.

Dear Ed,

The interval has been long enough for me to wonder if you are still around! Well just go ahead with this and hope for a decent forwarding service at that end.

How are you and Betty these days ? 1'11 bet you miss the old days in LA at times...but just remember this, things are not what they used to be ! This place, (in spite of increasing political pulse) is deader than Hell. Take it from me.

This is our beloved winter now...you remember; dreamy, sunny mornings...until about 1100...then swoosh ! Your walking around thru another dark, clammy and moldy rainy season. - Well, I guess bitter cold waves are not so pleasant eigher.

Marco seems to be getting prematurely old. He's healthy enough, but I guess the country is just as boring for him as it is for me. He still cannot pass up a chance to jump in carfor a ride now and then and seems to be just about his N№ 1 thrill.

As for the family here, everyone is fine. I believe I had told you that Lilliam Caridad was born June 1951 so now we are quite satisfied with the pair. They are both fat, dumb and happy (and how I envy them for that). Ross A. is now over three years and quite the boy...

As for me, same old stuff. Fourth year at the U. with passing grades and possibilities of the degree next year whereever it may be undertaken. I am pretty well fed up with the environment (again) and this time am sure to be gone sometime within the first quarter of 53. I have very little idea where... Panama U. is once again encouragèng. I would like Cuba in spite of the high standard of living there. Even Mexico would get me close enough to the continental US for more frequent visits which is what I need at the moment. (That is actually Doctors advice now.) At any rate, I feel that I might be able to do more somewhere else. Do you have any ideas ? They would certainly be welcomed.

All the ald acquaintances are still around. Mary is well and apparently happy. Judy is fine. I like Dave's new friend very much and am reminded of the old Marelius touch. We haven't many new friends these days and its my impression that we had better be getting a little more social minded.

Well, going to clip this short and head for the U. There's a petty strike on and one must keep up with the current at least. Best wishes to you folks and hope to hear from you soon.

As ever,

1.  Project HUMANOID was approved in the amount of $6000.00 for the period 1 March 1952 to 28 February 1953. This amount was based on the following funding requirements as set forth in the project outline which was presented for approval in May 1952:

Salary:

| 50.00    | 100.00   |
| $1978.00 | $3956.00 |

2.  HUMANOID-4 has been terminated, therefore the total available for expenditure by the station ($6000.00) exceeds the amount requested ($5934.00) by $282.00 ($72.00 plus $144.00 plus $66.00).

3. Project financial records in Headquarters are maintained in U. S. currency. Accordingly, DIR 16246 (OUT 50019) was expressed in dollar units. Unfortunately, we were not aware of recent fluctuations in the rate of exchange when the message was sent and the amounts quoted were not sufficient to maintain agent salaries on the previously established calca scale. This problem has been discussed with appropriate offices here as indicated in the attached memorandum for record which we believe to be self-explanatory.

4. In the event that the current financial status of project HRANOID is not hereby clarified to your satisfaction, we will be happy to furnish any additional information that may be required.

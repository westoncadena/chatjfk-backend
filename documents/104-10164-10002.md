**SECRET/SENSITIVE**

NS-380-66

TO : Director, Domestic Contact Servics

Attn.: Operatione: Support Scaff

DATE: 28 December 1966

FROM: Chief, Now Orleans Office

SUBJECT: Possible Opportunity to Recruit Agent In Place in Cuba

1. On Tuesday, 20 Dec 66, I received a call from Mr. Frank Bartes,
   former President of the Consolidated Railroads of Cube, He is an allen but
   we have FBI approval to contact dated 14 or 61. Mr. Barces is the source of.
   five reports on Cuba and wo, as well as the FBI, have been in frequent contact with hin,

2. He called on me primarily to tell me that his mother had arrived from Cube and would be willing to talk to m.

3. In the course of our conversation Mr. Sartes told me that he hed a cousin still living In Cube named Allcla Cruz Bustilic, who is a ballat dancer associated with Allcla Alonzo, the prime bellerine of Cube and also a well-known Communist, Bartes says that Allcle Bustillo is not a Communist and he and his feally have been in contact with her.

4. Miss Bustillo, who is about 29 years of age, was one of the group of Cuben ballet dancers which recently made a tour of Europe. A group of these Cubens dafected while the coupe was Paris, and this revived i publicity in our newspapers. Miss Bustillo, however, did not defect and continued on the tour and returned to Cube with the group. According to Ar. Bartos, Alicia Bustillo has recently Injured her foot and is not ma dancing, but is working as secretary to Alicia Alonzo,

5. Mr. Dartes told me that he had planned to meet Alicia Bustiilo In Paris and that she had egreed to mout him in Paris, but Mr. Bartes did not have the money to make the trip nor did he think that he would be ahle obtain the necessary vise for the trip to Paris because of his statue Cuban refugee.

6. Mr. Bortes says that Miss Bustitia has traveled all over the world with the Cuben ballat gram and tas visited most of the Complet Countries Including Chine, me feels gilte certain that the Cuban are will Bake another sour and that he will be adulaad in advance af ve del and Itinerary. He feels gulte certain that he will be able to streng • ilg South Hiss Buelliin provided the group visite • teles that he has always been very close to Miss Auello de calor alas un aster. Me feals culte cortals that she wمو داس holp the us If she wore approached in the proper monter, and no feel th the approach should be made through him because of his relationship and ferner closeness to her,

7. He says that he believes Miss Calllllo dos ast aftapt to

leave Cuba because of the fact that her family is there and that she would not leave unless she cou'd also get her fan'iy out. He believes that, despite the risk involved, she would be willing to act as an agent in place.

8. My relations with Mr. Bartes have been very good, and I an inclined to believe what to says. However, this whois estier, of course, would have to be evaluated by the Clandestine Services.

9. There is one other matter I would like to mention in connection with Mr. Bartes and that is that he served for two and a half months with a group of Cuber filers in the Congo, es he holds a pilot's license. He did not tell me and I did not ask who the sponsors of his group were of what their duties were. He did, however, mention a Colonel Waber and a Ar.. Saunders. I strongly suspect, of course, that this was an agercy operation and, If so, the Clandestine Services will aiready have a good deal of Information about Mr. Sartes.

10. I pass this on for whatever it is worth ard, If there is any further Information which I can provide, I shall be glad to do so.

DATE OF INFO. Late May 1960

PLACE & DATE ACQ. Late May 1960

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE: US citizen, a pathologist who has recently returned from Cuba where he spent five years in charge of rice production and associated research on a large rice plantation at Jabote near the Camaguey/Oriente border.

1. Just prior to my departure from Cuba on 26 May 60 I talked with a Vice President of one of Cuba's larger railroads. He occasionally goes on inspection tours of the railroad's facilities, and had just returned from an inspection of the company's spur lines in the Sierra Maestra region of Oriente province. He was accompanied at all times by a Cuban Army officer.

2. One of the spur lines in the Sierra Maestra ran into a restricted area. In this area my friend observed under construction numerous large concrete slabs, immediately adjacent to which were very tall towers of metal framework and wire construction. He says that these were not TV or radio antenna-type towers. From his very limited knowledge of the subject, i.e., the few pictures he has seen in magazines and newspapers of rocket launching sites, he said that these towers appeared similar to steel structures he has seen in pictures of rocket launching bases. He asked his Cuban Army escort what purpose the construction was to serve, and was told "It is not a good idea to ask too many questions where lightning might strike".

3. The concrete construction work was being handled by Mexican technicians.

4. Batista's construction of large storage tanks "for pure water" on Cayo Largo is widely known in Cuba, but few accept the fact that the storage tanks are for water. It is the consensus that these tanks are for fuel storage and will serve as a refueling base for submarines. I have flown over Cayo Largo and seen these tanks from the air. They do not look like water storage tanks to me.

5. I have heard that the tenth floor of the Havana Hilton is reserved for the Soviets. While staying there just prior to my departure from Cuba I noticed the elevators never stopped on the tenth floor. I inquired of the elevator boys, the desk clerks, and even the assistant manager, why the tenth floor wasn't open to guests. I was told that there were no guests on the tenth floor, that it was not completed, and was unaccustomed to guests. We sent our laundry away by laundry we returned to us with several pairs of shorts which did not belong to us. The laundry is marked by room number at the Seville Biltmore and the shorts stamped in white shorts was a tenth floor number.

Re: BARTES, FRANK

Dear Mr. Modell,

Mr. Bartes was examined by me 20 November 1965
for routine Federal Aviation Agency Class II
physical examination which he successfully
completed and was issued a medical cortificate.
He has a glasses limitation due to distant
and near vision deficiency.

He was given the following vaccines; Cholera,
Typhus, Typh. para-typh., Small Pox, Dipth.
Tet, and Plague.

Mr. Bartes is to return at a later date for
his Chest Xray and Hbg.

Thank you for referring this airman.

Sincerely yours,

# UNITED STA. ES COVEANMENT

# Memorandum

TO : Director, Domestic Contact Servios

Attn.: Operatione: Support Scaff

FROM: Chief, New Orleans Office

DATE: 28 December 1966

SUBJECT: Possible Opportunity to Recruit Agent in Place in Cuba

1. On Tuesday, 20 Dec 66, I received a call from Mr. Frank Bartes,
   former President of the Consolidated Rallroads of Cuba, de is an allen but we have FBI approval to contact deted 14 Apr 61. Mr. Barces is the source of five reports on Cuba and wo, as well as the FBI, have been in frequent contact with his.

2. He called on me primarily to tell me that his mother had arrived fron Cube and would be willing to talk to m.

3. In the course of our conversation Mr. Bartes told me that he had a cousin still living in Cube named Allcia Cruz Bustillo, vis is a ballet dancer associated with Alicia Alonzo, the prime ballerine of Cube and also a well-known Communist. Bartes says that Alicia Bustillo is not a Communist and he and his feally have been in contact with her.

4. Miss Bustillo, who is about 29 years of age, wes one of the group of Cuben ballet dancers which recently made a tour of Europe. A group of these Cubens defected while the troupe was Paris, and this received wide publicity in our newspapers, Miss Bustillo, however, did not defect and continued on the tour and returned to Cube with the group. According to Mr.Martes, Alicia Bustillo has recently Injured her foot and is not now dancing, but is working as secretary to Alicia Alonzo,

5. Mr. Bartes told me that he had planned to meet Alicia Bustillo In Paris and that she had agreed to meet him in Paris, but Mr. Bertes did not have the money to make the trip nor did he think that he would be able obtain tho necessary vise for the trip to Paris because of his status • Cuban refuges.

6. Mr. Bortes says that Miss Buatiile has traveled all over the world with the Cuban ballat group and hos visited most of the Caminit countries Including Chine. He feals quite certain that the Cuban grasp اب Aake another sour and that he will be advised in advence of the data and Itinerary No feats quite certain that he will be able to arrange a meeting With Hiss Bustillo provided the group visits on-scantry. No elaled that he has always been very close to Miss Bustillo dom to coralaro eleost as a alatar. He feels gulte certain that the wuld be willing to help the us If she wore approached in the proper menner, and he fools that the approach should be ade through him because of his relationship and former closures to her.

7. He says that he believes Alas etille des mi attempt to

leave Cube because of the fact that her family is there and that she would
not leave unless she could also get her family out, he believes that,
despite the risk involved, she would be willing to act as an agent in
place.

9. My relations with Mr. Bartos have been very good, and I am
   inclined to believe what he says. However, this whole matter, of course,
   would have to be evaluated by the Clandestine Services.

9. There is one other matter I would like to mention in connec-
   tion with Mr. Bartes and that is that he served for two and a half months
   with a group of Cuban fliers in the Congo, as he holds a pilot's license.
   He did not tell me and I did not ask who the sponsors of this group were or
   what their duties were. He did, however, mention a Colonel Weber and a
   Mr. Saunders. I strongly suspect, of course, that this was an agency
   operation and, if so, the Clandestine Services will already have a good
   deal of information about Mr. Bartes.

10. I pass this on for whatever it is worth and, if there is any
    further information which I can provide, I shall be glad to do so.

# SECRET

SECTION 11 MOTIVATION AND CONTROL

1. ESTIMATE SUBJECT'S MOTIVATION. (Be detailed, if possible cite evidence. Do not use stock comment such as "anti-cubaunist.")

Estimate Subject's primary motivation is financial. He has large family (wife and seven children) and has, in the past, been accustomed to high standard of living.

2. INDICATE WHAT CONTROL, IF ANY. EXISTS OVER THE SUBJECT. (If no control, or if there is a lack of real control explain.)

No real control exists over subject other than financial. He needs guaranteed employment to provide for his family. However, manipulation of his resident alien status, aviation occupation property, and U.S. licenses could offer control elements.

SECTION 111 COVER

Lack of security or evidence of collusion. His record indicates no connection with any other national intelligence service.

3. EXPLAIN ANY TRAINING SUBJECT HAS HAD IN CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS.

SECTION XVI

MISCELLANEOUS OPERATIONAL DATA AND REMARKS

From 1947 1960 Subject acted as vice president and later president of family railroad and agriculture enterprise. He made a commercial success of these operations which were later confiscated by the Castro Regime. He lost a large personal fortune as did other close members of his family. He was an ardent anti-Castro, anti communist leader of resistance groups both in Cuba and in New Orleans.

Subject previously used his own private aircraft in managing his commercial interests. It is hard to judge from the Subject file precisely why he has applied for a flying position in the Congo for reasons other than obvious financial aspects. Further, his 10 May 1965 application to Roberto Medellin indicates a high degree of stability and solvency in his present position.

SERVICE-MAINTENANCE AND SALES
APPROVED REPAIR STATION NO. 3823
P.O. BOX 26428 * NEW ORLEANS AIRPORT * NEW ORLEANS 36. LA.

14 April, 1965

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

This is to certify that I have known Mr. Francisco A. Bartos since June, 1962. He contacted our company to obtain a license permitting him to continue flying in the United States after his departure from Cuba.

Mr. Bartos held a Cuban pilot license issued by the Civil Aeronautics Commission of Cuba, November 22, 1956, No. 1017, Multi-engine Aircraft VFR.

The total aircraft flying time has been estimated due to the fact all personal effects including his log books were left in Cuba. A certification from Sunny South Aircraft, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, substantiates his estimated time due to single and multi-engine aircraft he purchased from them:

Cessna 172 130:00
Cessna 182 250:00
Cessna 310 750:00

Mr. Fausto A. Valdez, a Cuban citizen now residing at 10 SW 32nd Ave., Miami, Florida, holding an ATR certificate, 1515842, issued 11/28/61, has also certified via affidavit, Mr. Bartos, has close to 1,000:00 hours of multi-engine time.

Mr. Bartos has completed the Private Pilot course with us and has the necessary papers pertinent to an FAA license. He is presently continuing his studies for a Commercial Pilot rating - single and multi-engine.

The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize investigative efforts to authenticate Hoover memoranda dated 8/24-25/36.

Document Section, FBI Laboratory, determined the type appearing on Hoover memorandum dated 8/25/36 was prepared on a Remington typewriter with an elite type used since October, 1935. Hoover memorandum to Tamm dated 9/10/36, was prepared on an IBM typewriter with pica-style type used since 1930.

The letterhead used on both Hoover memoranda of 8/24-25/36 was authorized FBI stationery effective August 14, 1936.

On 3/10/75, Mr. Donald B. Schewe, Assistant Librarian, Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York, advised that The White House Ushers Appointment Book contained entries showing that on Thursday, August 24, 1936, from 9:20 a.m. to 10:12 a.m., President Roosevelt met with Mr. Hoover in his residence at The White House prior to leaving for his office. Schewe pointed out that this meeting was significant since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.

On 4/2/75, review of Cordell Hull Papers, Library of Congress, reflected that a Desk Diary (container #68, folder #295, microfilm #38) of Secretary Hull contained an entry on 8/25/36 that the Secretary had luncheon with the President between 1:00 p.m. to 3:15 p.m.

CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM BY
JOHN EDGAR HOOVER DATED AUGUST 25, 1936.

On this date, SA Alonzo L. Lacey of the Intelligence Division delivered the above-captioned memoranda to the Laboratory with a request to determine the make of typewriter employed in the preparation of the memoranda and the date of introduction of the type styles employed. The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether or not the type styles on the typewriters used to write the memoranda were in use on the dates appearing on the memoranda.

It was determined that the "Memorandum For Mr. Tamm from John Edgar Hoover dated September 10, 1936" was prepared on an IBM typewriter equipped with a pica style of type which has been in use since 1930. The typewriting comprising the "Confidential Memorandum by John Edgar Hoover dated August 25, 1936" was determined to have been prepared on a Remington typewriter equipped with an elite style of type that has been in use since October, 1935.

The memoranda were returned to SA Lacey.

# RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY ON 3/10-12/75

On 3/10/74, Mr. DONALD B. SCHEWE, Assistant Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised of our interest in locating any communications bearing upon a conversation between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT and former Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of August, 1936. Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J. EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr. ROOSEVELT allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation to a memorandum and that we were interested in locating this memorandum or some information bearing upon above conversation. Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY, on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime he would conduct some research in this matter.

On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had conducted some research relative to our telephone call on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific with regard to the dates of the information desired. SCHEWE was advised that to the best of our knowledge the conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT (FDR), HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned the internal security of the US.

Mr. SCHEWE, at this point, furnished a Xerox copy of a "buck slip" dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is attached) on White House stationery, classified "Confidential and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR". Mr. SCHEWE stated that "buck slips" are nothing more than a cover memorandum utilized to transmit communications which are attached thereto. It is to be noted that this "buck slip" indicates that attached to it was a memorandum for the Secretary of State, unsigned, undated and recommending coordination of activities of all agents of the Government in foreign countries. SCHEWE advised

62-716395-

ENCLOSURE

NW-88296 DocId:32989628 Page.10


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

that the synopsis of this memorandum which appears on. the "buck slip" was the usual practice at that time to identify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added. that this was the only document he was able to locate which may have some bearing on the desired information. SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the referred to memorandum may be located among the collection of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored at the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing personnel the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment book contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM
FDR departed the White House for a visit to the flood areas in NY, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Thursday, August 24, 1936, FDR returned to White House at 8:45 AM.
9:20 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER from 9:20 AM to 10:12 AM.

(Note * - There is no entry in this book for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr. HULL was there. Mr. SCHEWE advised that it is interesting to note that. FDR met Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for his office in the White House. SCHEWE also pointed out that this meeting was significant since FDR. met with Mr. HOOVER on 8/24/36, immediately after returning from an extended trip. This, according to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's usual practice.

There was no record in the White House Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate that FDR met with either Mr. HULL or Mr. HOOVER on that date. This book indicates that FDR departed the White House on Tuesday, 8,/25/75, at 10:40 PM for a trip to the draught areas, in upper Maine, South Dakota and North


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

Dakota, as well as a visit to Mt. Rushmore. FDR did not return to the White House until Sunday, Sept. 6, 1936, at 10:02 AM.

The White House Usher's Appointment Book further reflects that FDR, during the period July 10, 1936, to Aug. 10, 1936, was away from the White House campaigning. FDR returned to the White House on 8/10/36, and remained there until 8/13/36, when he again departed on a trip and returned on 8/24/36. FDR also departed from the White House on 8/25/36, and returned on 9/6/36.

Mr. SCHEWE also produced to interviewing personnel the appointment book of FDR's private secretary, GRACE TULLY for the pertinent period. This appointment book reflects all of FDR's office appointments. A review of this appointment book fails to reflect that FDR met or had an appointment with Mr. HOOVER in his office during the period 8/13/36 to 9/6/36. However, this appointment book does reflect that during this period FDR did have a meeting with CORDELL HULL on 8/25/36, at 1:00 PM.

Mr. SCHEWE further advised that he personally reviewed the following and was unable to locate any documents or references which could possibly shed some light on the matter of interest to us:

1.) Papers kept in FDR's safe.

2.) Papers kept by his secretary in a separate White House safe.

3.) Papers kept in FDR's official presidential file.

4.) Papers kept in FDR's alphabetical file maintained by his secretary.

5.) Individual agencies files.

6.) J. EDGAR HOOVER's file.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

7.) Attorney General's file.

8.) Assistant Attorney General's file.

9.) National Security file.

10.) Internal Security file.

11.) FBI file.

In conclusion, Mr. SCHEWE stated that after reviewing all of the above data, he concluded that the pertinent document of interest to us is not at the FDR Library at Hyde Park, NY. SCHEWE added that if any such document is at the Library, it is misfiled and as there are approximately 21 million pages of manuscripts and documents at the Library, it would be impossible to locate same.

It is to be noted that on the enclosed "buck slip" there are four penciled notations, i.e. 285-C, X20, X285 and X67. SCHEWE stated that these nottions are part of the FDR Library cross-reference system. SCHEWE added that he checked these references and could locate nothing further regarding the matter of interest to us. SCHEWE stated that these references pertained to the enclosed "buck slip".

# UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Memorandum

TO : MR. CALLAHAN

DATE: 2/7/75.

FROM : J. B. ADAMS

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 1975

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee. Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee in a very responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence in the intelligence agencies.

Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary to prevent such abuses in the future.

Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies involved in domestic 'intelligence.

The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately 40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance. Miller indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being personally satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance. Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement. He stated that he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary Committee was on the impeachment inquiry. Our experience in this regard was pointed out wherein the Judiciary Committee in connection with the 17 wiretaps had written us a letter indicating that if we made classified

Memorandum for Mr. Callahan
Re: SENSTUDY 1975

information available they would afford it appropriate security restricted
to members only, excluding staff, and would not make the information
public. Subsequent to the hearings, the Committee published its report
which contained our classified documents right along with the Top Secret
classifications. Senator Church was not aware of this, appeared surprised
by it, and stated surely the information must have been declassified. I
advised him that not by us and it was our information.

Senator Church was asked whether in his opinion the formation
of the Select Committee would have any effect on the proliferation of
committees seeking to obtain testimony from the FBI and it was his opinion
that this would have a favorable effect. He said he had been in touch with
other members of the Senate who felt that it was a waste of time to have
repetitious testimony on the same subject matter before a variety of
committees and he had the feeling that the other committees would hold off
until after the Senate Select Committee completed its hearings. He indicated
that he could not vouch for what would happen in the House, however, he
intended to speak to the House leadership in order to try to effect some
coordinated approach there also, because he was well aware of the large
number of committees seeking to provide oversight or obtain information
from the intelligence agencies.

A question arose as to the extent of cooperation with the Committee
and Senator Church was assured that the FBI would be completely responsive
subject to certain limitations which would have to be delineated by the
President in order to protect sensitive sources and information. Senator
Church indicated that he was going to talk to the President in this regard in
order to secure his complete cooperation, and it was Senator Church's feeling
that the Committee should be entitled to answers to any questions they might
ask without restriction other than, of course, the identities of informants.
He felt the progress of the Committee would be severely impaired if it were
necessary to go to Court over such questions to obtain enforcement of their
right to have access to whatever information they need.

ACTION:

Information.

#moR16
![ALL FELITORACICORTAD HEREIN IS US00 DATA)-19-01 ]

1. The Intelligence Community Staff, with John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy/IC, as my representative in these matters, will keep the Board and other appropriate officials advised as to progress of the investigations conducted by the Senate and House Select Committees investigating intelligence activities. In particular, it will ensure that we are kept informed as to materials which are formally being provided to the Select Committees by all elements of the Community. The USIB Ad Hoc Group will assist on this matter and provide the mechanism for regular and constant communications.

2. In response to this assignment, the Intelligence Community Staff is establishing a registry for documentation relating to the investigations. This registry will be a source of reference of all responses, testimony, et cetera, provided by USIB agencies and available to your designated representatives.

3. In order to make the registry useful to the Board, it is essential that it include:

a. File copies of documents or other materials which each Intelligence Community element provides to one of the Select Committees where the originating agency considers the materials to involve aspects of Community activities, and/or which may result in follow-on queries concerning the functioning of the Community. The availability of this documentation will be of particular importance if it is expected there will be subsequent inquiries relating to the materials provided and involving elements of the Community other than the originating clement.

Intelligence Community Staff 21 April 1975

Mr. L. Frank Schwartz
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Room 4637
J. Edgar Hoover Building
Washington, D. C.

Dear Frank:

Reference is your request for comments on the sample abstracts prepared in the FBI as a report on materials being provided to the Senate Select Committee.

As you know, we want to make the Community Registry as complete a record as possible of what is provided to the Committee, and for this reason hope that the actual copy of special reports and particularly important documents will be provided to the Registry. Where this is not done, an abstract or summary of each document or homogenous set of documents.

We have amended the abstract format slightly to include an entry for "Document Classification." A copy of the amended format is enclosed.

Your sample abstracts require a few alterations to make them more "indexable."

a. Item 1, "TITLE/SUBJECT" refers to the subject matter of the material which is being provided. The abstract on the FBI Manual of Instructions should have an entry here something like "Instructions covering FBI Investigations in the Security Field," rather than the title of the Senate Committee.

b. The date at the head of the page should be the date of preparation of the abstract. The date of submission to the Committee is listed at Item 9.

c. The entry "ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION" identified the organization with authority to release the document.

NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 30


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

d. The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for instance, whether your sample on the letterhead memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods. The summary as written gives no indication as to the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the single sentence now used to describe all of them covers the waterfront.

e. If the request for information comes officially from the Committee, the Committee title should be entered under "REQUESTOR," but if the requestor is an individual member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.

f. The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS," has particular significance since it is important to know if there are Third Agency, or sources and methods, or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is the place to identify them. We are beginning to use the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with the document for which another agency must concur in the release. The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such other agency an idea as to whether we see any important reason why they should be concerned about release of the document. The entry in this final section of the format is expected to prove useful for this purpose.

5. One copy of the document or its abstract is all that is needed by the registry.

6. The mailing address of the registry is:

RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI
SPECIAL AGENT (SA) BY SSC
STAFF MEMBER

Set out below is information available to the FBI
concerning captioned matter.

SSC Interview of Retired FBI SA Lish Whitson

On the afternoon of April 23, 1975, Mr. Lish Whitson por.onally appeared at the office of an FBI official, stated that he had just been interviewed by Mr. Michael Epstein, Staff Member of the SSC, and was desirous of reporting the result. of that interview which Whitson related as follows:

Epstein first asked Whitron when he entered the FBI, when he first arrived for assignment at FBI Headquarters, to which Headquarters Division he had been assigned, and when he retired. (FBI records reveal that Whitson joined the FBI as an SA November 20, 1933, and retired June 19, 1972. He was assigned at Headquarters December 16, 1941, attached to the Domestic Intelligence Division and served in that Division until hi retirement. The current name for that Division i: Intelligence Division). Epstein then told Whitson that he knew that Whitson had at one time mailed a package to Martin Luther King from Tampa, Florida, and asked Whitson to relate the detail concerning this matter. Whitson thereupon

told Epstein that in the late Summer of 1964, former FBI
Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan had telephoned
Whitton at his home one Saturday and told him that late
FBI Director Hoover wanted Whitton to deliver a package
to Miami, Florida, by plane and on arrival at the Miami
airport to telephone Sullivan for further instructions.
Whitton did as directed and upon calling Sullivan, was
instructed to address the package to Mr. Martin Luther King.
Accordingly, Whitton had the package weighed, put postage
stamps on it, and addressed it to Martin Luther King (not
Mrs. Martin Luther King as Epstein had indicated). The
following day, Sunday, Whitton flew back to Washington and
on the next day, Monday, he informed Sullivan that his
instructions had been carried out. Sullivan commented to
Whitton "Someday I will tell you about that."

Epstein asked Whitton who had paid for the stamps
to mail the package and Whitton said that he had probably gone
to utilizing per diem money. Epstein asked whether he had
put a return address on the package and Whitton replied in
the negative. Epstein asked if Whitton had gone to the Miami
FBI Office, whether any Agent had met him at the Miami airport,
and whether Whitton had discussed this matter with anyone,
Whitton told Epstein that he had not gone to the Miami Office,
that no Agent had met him, and that he had discussed the matter
only with Sullivan. At this point, Whitton asked Epstein how
he got the story. Epstein merely laughed and did not reply
to the question.

Epstein also asked Whitton whether he had ever written
a memorandum regarding this matter, to which Whitton replied in
the negative. Epstein asked if Whitton had ever seen a memorandum
on this matter and Whitton again replied in the negative.

OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

## RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA) BY
FOG STAFF MEMBER

On April 24, 1975, Whitson telephoned the FBI official referred to above on two occasions to report additional information which Epstein had secured from Whitson by telephone on April 24, 1975. This additional information was as follows:

Epstein asked how Whitson had made the trip to Miami; that is, how it was paid for. Whitson told him he had issued a Government Transportation Request (GTR). Epstein asked whether there was any prior written authorization for Whitson to make the trip and Whitson told him there was none. Epstein asked what kind of record would have been made covering the trip and Whitson explained that the only record he knew of would be the expense voucher he submitted covering the expenses involved and possibly the copy of the GTR which he had issued. Whitson explained to Epstein that the voucher would merely show that the GTR had been issued for a round-trip to and from Miami and how much per diem had been claimed in connection with the trip. Epstein inquired as to whether Whitson had registered at the Airport Hotel in Miami, and, if so, whether it was under his own name. Whitson told Epstein that he had registered under his name at this hotel.

Additional Information Furnished to FBI By Whitson

In addition to the foregoing, Whitson furnished to the FBI official the following information on April 23, 1975, which information he did not furnish to Epstein.

Then Sullivan told Whitson he wanted him to fly the package to Miami, he stated that only he, Sullivan, Mr. Hoover, Mr. Tolson, (then FBI Associate Director) and Mr. Belmont (then FBI Assistant to the Director) knew of this situation. (at the time, 1964, Sullivan was an Assistant Director.) Sullivan never did explain to Whitson anything more regarding this incident.

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY COVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SGC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA) BY
SGC STAFF MEMBER

Whitson said that when he arrived at the North
Terminal at National Airport, following Sullivan's telephonic
instructions, a young man who was unknown to Whitson but who
addressed him as "Mr. Whitson," turned over to him a package
which was wrapped in brown paper and sealed with sealing tape.
It is Whitson's recollection the package measured approximately
eight inches by eight inches by one inch.

It is Whitson's further recollection that at the time
the foregoing occurred, King was either just about to go abroad
to receive the Nobel Peace Prize or probably had already gone
abroad. It was Whitson's recollection that sometime shortly
after the mailing of the package, Sullivan commented to Whitson
that the package had not yet been received by King. Because of
this remark, Whitson is of the belief that the package was
mailed to King at the headquarters of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and not to King's residence. Further,
it was Whitson's recollection that it was not long after he
had mailed the package that King had a personal meeting with
Mr. Hoover in the latter's office.

Whitson observed that in his opinion, the information
which was in the possession of Epstein prior to interviewing
Whitson must have originated with Sullivan. Whitson noted that
Mr. Hoover and Mr. Tolson are both deceased and that he has
heard nothing to indicate that Mr. Belmont has been contacted
by members of the Staff of the SGC. One other factor that
causes Whitson to feel that Sullivan was the source of the
information was a question Epstein raised as to whether Whitson
had put a return address on the package when he addressed it to
King. Whitson said he recalls that when he was in Miami and
received the telephonic instructions from Sullivan, Sullivan
told him that he should put a return address on the package
and Whitson then pointed out to Sullivan that if he did so,
and the name of the addressee became smeared, the package
would end up at someone's return address rather than in the

dead lettor office. Sullivan concurred that no return address
should bo uced. Thus, Sullivan would probably have reason
to have corconted regarding the uce or nomuce of a return
address.

On April 24, 1975, Whitson furnished by telephone
to the aforementioned Dureau official the following additional
loformation which he had not furnished to Epstein. Whitcon
stated it van now his recollection he had made the Iliami
trip cither in the late Summer or early Fall of 1964 and that
King was "away" at the tine.

## FEI Records Concerning Whitcon'o Travel

The following information is on record in the FDI
conccrning the travel of Whiteon discussed above. On
December 9, 1964, a Travel Voucher vac processed for payment
to Whitron the sun of $19.40 for travel during the period
November 1-30, 1964. On record alco is a memorandun copy of
a Government Transportation Request issued November 21, 1964,
to National Airlines in the sun of $107.40 for air coach travel,

# Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT,

TO: Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation DATE: May 20, 1954.

FROM: The Attorney General

SUBJECT: MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE 155-26

The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled *Irvine v. California*, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveillances by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisal of the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters relating to the internal security of the country.

It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities of espionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons. In such instances I am of the opinion that the national interest requires that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This use need not be limited to the development of evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in connection with internal security matters equally as important as the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions. The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance by the FBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.

I do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court in *Irvine v. California*, *supra*, requires a different course. That case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investigations. It is quite clear that in the *Irvine* case the Justices of the Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of installing a microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the installation of a microphone in a bedroom or in some comparably intimate location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however, that important intelligence or evidence relating to matters connected with the national security can only be obtained by the installation of a microphone in such a location. It is my opinion, that under such circumstances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the Supreme Court's decision in the *Irvine* case.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

- 2 -

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones, suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realized that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected. It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation which will permit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner most conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of internal security and the national safety are paramount and, therefore, may compel the unrestricted use of this technique in the national interest.

Memorandum

TO: MR. WALSH

FROM: L. C. GROOVER

DATE: 4/3/75

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams memorandum dated 3/20/75 captioned as above and letter of Senator Frank Church dated 3/19/75.

Relet requested, among other things, the titles and number of FBI field office agents assigned to internal security, intelligence collection and/or counterintelligence matters, operations or activities, together with the percent of total agent man-hours devoted to such matters, operations and activities (page 3, item IIIC of relet).

The purpose of this memorandum is to forward to the Legal Counsel Division, through the Intelligence Division, the response, attached herewith, to the above request.

It is noted the request specifically mentions internal security, intelligence collection and counterintelligence matters. Our response has been constructed in the traditional two categories of internal security and counterintelligence. Intelligence collection (informants) is included in the data for both of the other categories as appropriate.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum with enclosure be forwarded to the Intelligence Division for review, classification and approval and, thereafter, forwarded to the Legal Counsel Division which is coordinating replies to the Senate Select Committee.

ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures
prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current
Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these
figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a
hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability
the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign
threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends
that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate
Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment
in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as III С.

# ADDENDUM: LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION PVD:dkg 4-14-75

Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:

(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this Division has had with Fred B. Griffith of the Inspection Division, it appears that the information contained in this memorandum may be classified confidential under Executive order 11652.

(2) Before making any determination as to whether we make such information available to the Senate Select Committee, it would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast position that this information not be made available to the Committee or that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

Mr. L. C. Groover to Mr. Walsh memorandum dated 4/14/75 entitled "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities" forwarded to the Intelligence Division for review the titles and numbers of FBI field office Agents assigned to internal security, intelligence collection, and/or counter- intelligence matters, operations or activities. This was in response to requirement IIIC of Senator Church's letter dated 3/19/75.

By addendum dated 4/4/75 the Intelligence Division recommended that the Legal Counsel Division discusse with the staff of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) our reluctance to provide these type figures to the SSC.

On 4/11/75 I discussed with Mr. John Clark, Associate Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence for the intelligence community, the request of Senator Church. Specifically, Mr. Clark was asked if Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had received such a request and how they responded. Mr. Clark advised that CIA had not received a specific request for the titles and numbers of CIA officers assigned to intelligence collection or counter- intelligence matters. However, CIA had received a request to identify the names and numbers of CIA covert officers assigned overseas.

Mr. Clark advised that CIA intended to advise the Staff Director of the SSC that CIA was unwilling to provide such names and numbers to the SSC for retention in its files. However, CIA would be willing to allow a senior staff member or the Staff Director to review the names and numbers of CIA covert office overseas at the CIA headquarters building.

1 - Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 4/11/75

1 - Mr. W. R. Wannall
1 - Mr. W. O. Cregar

On 4/11/75, from 10:00 am until 12:20 pm, staff members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities were briefed by Assistant Director Wannall and members of his staff in the Conference Room at INTD. Briefed from the Committee were Mr. William Miller, Staff Director; Mr. Frederick A. O. Schwarz III, Chief Counsel; and Messrs. Mark Gitenstein, Marvin Epstein, Patrick Shea, Britt Snider and Loch Johnson, all staff members,

The first hour of the briefing was occupied with the showing of the INTD slide presentation and commentary which provided highlights of the work of the INTD, both in the counterintelligence and internal security field. Following this presentation a question and answer period ensued for the rest of the briefing. Mr. Miller and Mr. Schwarz posed most of the questions.

In the counterintelligence field the thrust of the questioning was directed toward the continuing growth of the hostile intelligence presence in the United States and its short-term and long-term effect on the FBI's operations.

Mr. Wannall pointed out that the Director on previous occasions had indicated his intention to "beef up" the counterintelligence effort of the FBI by the addition of some 250 Special Agents, and that INTD had also effected certain programs designed to assign certain counterintelligence functions to non-Agent personnel, thereby freeing additional Special Agents to function as case officers. In response to a question as to whether the additional investigative effort necessary to counter the mounting hostile intelligence threat might not involve investigation of more and more American citizens, Mr. Wannall conceded

that this was inevitable. He stressed, however, the investi-
gative policies of the FBI which protected the constitutional
rights and right of privacy of such individuals.

On the domestic internal security side the thrust
of the questioning appeared to indicate an interest in the
predication, duration and administrative controls of investi-
gations of domestic organizations and individuals. Again,
Mr. Wannall stressed the precautions inherent in FBI policy
and instructions to the field in these matters, pointing out,
in effect, that these investigations are founded on statutory
authority and are closely supervised by experienced personnel
at Headquarters level. The Committee staff appeared to accept
these answers and no critical or hostile attitudes on their
part were evident.

The briefing was terminated at 12:20 pm, due to
commitments on the part of the staff. Mr. Miller and
Mr. Schwarz both expressed their appreciation for the briefing
and indicated it had been most instructive. They indicated
a desire to continue these discussions at some later date and
Mr. Wannall assured them that he would be happy to continue
the briefing at any future mutually agreeable time.

Perhaps most significant of all questions posed was
the final question by Mr. Schwarz in which he inquired as to
what advantages and disadvantages to the FBI could be anticipated
as a result of the Committee fulfilling its mandate, Mr. Wannall
replied that any statutory authority defining and affirming the
FBI's role in the intelligence collection field would certainly
be a positive achievement, He also stated that any result of
the Committee's investigation which would tend to limit the
investigative resources or the investigative effectiveness of
the FBI would surely be an unfortunate negative factor.

None. For information.

FORMER SUPERVISOR LISH WHITSON
ASSIGNED INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

At 3:17 p.m., 4/22/75 former Special Agent Lish Whitson who for many years was a supervisor in the Intelligence Division telephoned me to advise that he had received a request to appear for an interview by Michael Epstein, staff member of the Senate Select Committee. The interview was scheduled for 4/23/75.

In response to a question by Mr. Whitson, he was advised that to the writer's knowledge this was the first former Bureau employee who had been requested to appear for an interview by any member of the staff of the Select Committee. Whitson stated that he was proceeding on the basis that he would respond to questions propounded to him but he had some reservation in his mind concerning answering questions which would involve material which he knew to be classified at the time he retired. He commented he had noted in the news media that staff members of the Committee were reportedly to be granted clearances through TOP SECRET - Q (Atomic Energy Matters).

Whitson was advised by the writer that while it was true staff members were being granted clearances, the Bureau was endeavoring to establish procedures through the Attorney General whereby highly sensitive and classified material could be revealed on a restricted basis in response to Committee inquiries; for example, in some instances we would request that only the Majority and Minority leaders on the Committee be furnished certain types of material and in other instances only the Senators themselves as opposed to all staff members.

Mr. Whitson said in view of this, it was his intention to be as responsive and candid during the interview by Mr. Epstein as he could be but if any questions arose in his mind with respect to revelation as to what he, Whitson, considered to be sensitive material, he anticipated he would express his concern to Mr. Epstein and advise him he felt it would be appropriate to check with the Bureau since he is aware of regulations by the Attorney General which preclude revealing FBI information without the Attorney General's approval.

Among those items cited in the attachment to the Committee's 3/19/75, letter was a study on jurisdiction prepared for former Acting FBI Director Louis Patrick Gray III by the Office of Legal Counsel, dated 5/18/72. Representatives of the Legal Counsel Division do not believe the 5/18/72 study is, in itself, appropriate to furnish in response to the question of the Senate Select Committee on legal authority. However, Legal Counsel Division believes that two internal FBI memoranda, prepared in connection with the drafting of the 5/18/72 study, would be pertinent to the Senate Select Committee's inquiry. Accordingly, two documents, items one and two of attached memorandum for the Committee, are being furnished.

D : Mr. Dalbey

FROM : J. A. Mintz

SUBJECT: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

DATE: 5/16/72

You requested analysis of the legal authority for FBI criminal intelligence collection and its relationship to our statutory jurisdiction in criminal matters.

"The gathering of criminal intelligence information" describes activity not subject to precise definition. However, its general objective is well understood by those engaged in law enforcement. There exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are directed toward profit without regard to the restraints of the law. Yel, by the very nature of their associations. little actual participation in criminal acts may be observed by the most astute law enforcement observer. Their existence and contribution to the sum of criminal behavior has been detected and to some degree measured by the collection of data concerning their personal life-styles, property holdings, associates, influence, and access to capital. Such information has been characterized as "criminal intelligence."

For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identify these resources of the criminal element. Congress responded to this need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The Congressional findings were that organized crime in the United States is a highly sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains billions of dollars from America's economy by unlawful conduct and by the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption. Legitimate business and labor unions are infiltrated and corrupted and our democratic processes are subverted. The problem was declared to be of of national concern both as to our economy and the domestic security.

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI JURISDICTION; CRIMINAL
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

The Act attempted to attack organized crime by making criminal the management of syndicated gambling and by prohibiting racketeering activity characteristic of organized crime including the use of illegal proceeds for investment in legitimate business enterprises.

The long-established suspicions of law enforcement officers were confirmed by the Congressional findings but statutory enactments did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains the task of establishing the identities of those constituting the national menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt. "Criminal intelligence" collection is one means by which this responsibility may be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity of witnesses willing to testify and of the high mortality potential of those who do appear. A classic example of such intimidation is reported in *United States v. Addonizio*, 451 F2d 49 (3rd Cir. 1972) where a prospective witness in a corruption case found an anonymous note on the seat of his car which read "This could have been a bomb. Keep your mouth shut."

Accepting the need for intelligence gathering as a practical necessity, the issue remains as to its propriety in the face of Constitutional protections. If the Supreme Court announces that individuals have a Constitutionally protected right of privacy that may be overcome only through established arrest, search, and subpoena procedures, the issue will be settled. But, thus far, the Court has only drawn upon the concept of Constitutional privacy to resolve cases involving special circumstances such as marital affairs (*Griswold v. Connecticut*, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)) and interception of communications (*Katz v. United States*, 389 U.S. 347 (1967))

More specific Constitutional limitations on the criminal intelligence function may be found in the First Amendment protections of speech and assembly; the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonable searches and seizures; and the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.

The theme consistently found in decisions having a bearing on the relationship between these rights and the collection of criminal intelligence is that, when in direct conflict, the collection efforts must yield. Such is

not to label criminal intelligence as necessarily the product of malpractice, but to recognize the paramount nature of the Constitutional interests being safeguarded. Other incidents of government regulatory authority have been required to yield as well when confronted with legitimate claims of Constitutional protection, e.g. the administrative search cases, *Camara v. Municipal Court*, 387 U.S. 523 (1967).

Overt and obtrusive conduct susceptible of being characterized as harassment may well be enjoined as, for example, was the case of an obvious 24-hour-a-day physical surveillance of an individual, his home, relatives, friends, and associates (*Giancana v. Johnson*, 335 F2d 366 (7th Cir. 1964) cert. den. 379 U.S. 1001. Similar results might be expected where an identified officer loiters in the subject's place of business (*Bee See Books, Inc. v. Leary*, 291 F. Supp. 622 (SD N.Y. 1968) or openly attends organizational meetings where his presence inhibits communication and the transaction of the business of the assembly (Local 309, *United Furniture Workers v. Gates*. 75 F. Supp. 620 (ND Ind. 1948)). However, open photographic surveillance of public gatherings (*Donahoe v. Duling*, 330 F. Supp. 308 (ED Va. 1971)) and secret monitoring of criminal activities through the use of undercover agents (*Lewis v. United States*, 385 U.S. 206 (1966)) and informants (*Hoffa v. United States*, 385 U.S. 295 (1966)) have met with judicial approval.

Obviously, criminal intelligence information gained by unreasonable search and seizure or through compelled self-incrimination is tainted and subject to judicial condemnation upon complaint of one having the requisite standing.

Perhaps, the decision coming nearest to discussing the legality of criminal intelligence collection was *Anderson v. Sills*, 106 N. J. Super. 545, 256 A2d 298 (1969), (reversed on the ground more complete record was needed to support the decision) 56 N. J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970). New Jersey had responded to the threat of continuing civil disorders by collecting intelligence information on persons and events alleged to have some relationship to such activities. The trial court held the collection effort to be unconstitutional because it conflicted with the First Amendment.

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

However, the court order to destroy the intelligence files excepted instances "where such information will be used to charge persons with specifically defined criminal conduct." 256 A2d at 305. Thus, the decision may be interpreted as drawing a distinction between collection of intelligence information where political or social factors are involved and First Amendment freedoms therefore may be directly inhibited and collection of criminal intelligence information where the objective is the establishment of criminal conduct and the identities of the offenders. While the Fourth and Fifth Amendment may be enjoyed by the guilty and innocent alike, it is improbable that the First Amendment would be stretched so far as to protect freedom of speech and assembly when such speech and assembly constitute elements of a criminal offense. On appeal, the Supreme Court of New Jersey returned the case for further development of the record and observed "... the executive branch may gather whatever information it reasonably believes to be necessary to enable it to perform the police roles, detectional and preventive. A court should not interfere in the absence of proof of bad faith or arbitrariness." 256 A2d at 305.

A tentative conclusion may be stated, subject to further development of the case law. The gathering of criminal intelligence information for the purpose of developing evidence of specific offenses characteristic of organized crime is legally justified as well as practically necessary. Where there is diversion from the proper objective and such collection efforts are manipulated to cause harassment or where such activity conflicts with Constitutional rights, to that extent the criminal intelligence program must be reformed.

UNITED STATES GOV MENT

Memorandum

TO: Mr. Dalbey DATE: 5/18/72

FROM : J. B. Hotis

SUBJECT: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

You requested an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct domestic intelligence investigations. The question of the jurisdictional basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic Intelligence Division and will not be discussed here.

It is fair to say that the domestic intelligence program is one of the more controversial areas of the Bureau's activities. For one thing, an intelligence investigation casts a broader net than inquiries that are directed toward the proof of a specific offense. A large amount of raw data is collected, much of which has no immediate bearing on potential offenses or offenders. But seemingly trivial information may later become important in the detection and prevention of violence or civil disorder. There are also fears that these investigations may eventually touch upon one's political beliefs, habits or associations; or that information collected for proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Government. Each is a legitimate concern. The notion of Government prying into the personal lives of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there is a strong sense that the Government must acquire necessary intelligence information if it is to meet its responsibilities in connection with the national security.

One of the major concerns about our domestic intelligence activities is that they are not supervised or monitored by any outside agency. The claim is made that the Executive Branch has been left wide discretion to define its own authority, and to choose the directions, methods, and focus of its investigations. For one thing, the law has never made clear what facts and circumstances must be present to authorize an intelligence investigation, nor how far such an investigation may lawfully proceed without being directed toward proof of a specific offense.

# Memorandum J. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our clectronic surveillances in security matters are not submitted for prior court approval. For another, the exclusionary rule which provides the usual method of judicial control over investigative procedures, is not often available in security cases. Since the goal is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the courts. As a result, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters. and what we do with the information acquired.

In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form of a watchdog committee to oversee our operations. Senator Ervin, who chairs the Senate Subsommittee on Constitutional Rights has expressed particular concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government to gather information. In an exchange of correspondence with the Department of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation of the Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic intelligence information. He has also suggested that legislation migini be enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measure would pass the Congress, but the proposal does show the mood of the times.

A parallel trend may be developing in the courts. In several recent cases, plaintiffs have made the claim that Government information gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspects, may have a "chilling effect" on the exercise of First Amendment rights. These challenges thus far have not been successful. Anderson v. Sills, 56 N. J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970); Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (E.D. Va. 1971); American Civil Liberties Union v. Westmoreland, 323 F. Supp. 1153 (N. D. III. 1971).

The courts have generally recognized that one of the principal functions of the Bureau is to gather information law violators, agitators of violence and possible subversives.. Tatum v. Laird, 444 F2d 947, 957 (D. C. Cir. 1971) cert. granted, 404 U.S. 955 (1971); The Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee, et al. v. J. Edgar Hoover, et. al., 70 Cv. 2640 HRT, decided February 16, 1972. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has observed that the identity of the agency gathering such information is determinative of the significance of any alleged chill to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 66

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

to First Amendment rights. Thus, in *Davis v. Ichord*, 442 F2d 1207 (D. C.
Cir. 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional
Committee's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was
insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or
controversy. This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear of
investigation by the present Committee home to themselves," their fears
were wholly speculative; there were no criminal proceedings confronting
them; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in *Davis* found
that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the
investigation; whenever a Committee of the Congress seeks punitive action,
the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a
judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional
rights.

This latter aspect of the *Davis* decision was given perspective by
the Court of Appeals in *Tatum*. In contrasting the potential impact on First
Amendment rights occasioned by investigations conducted by the military
with investigations conducted by a civilian investigative agency, such as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Court observed:

The compilation of data by a civilian investigative
agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the
deterrent on the exercise of the constitutional right
of free speech that such action by the military is, because
a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always
being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and
the approval of the courts. * * *

There, the Court pointedly examined the "source of the chill" as it had in
*Davis*, and in applying the "chilling effect doctrine", singled out the FBI
as a source which does not generate a reasonable basis for inhibitions or
apprchensions. In this connection the Court stated,

- 3 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Referring to our holding in Davis that the
"source of the chill" is important in determining whether
there is any inhibiting effect on the exercise of First
Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant
difference between investigative actions taken by a
military agency in reference to civilians and similar
investigative actions taken by a regular investigative
agency of a civilian branch of the Government.

One of the functions of a civilian investigative
agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is
to compile information on law violators, agitators of
violence, and possible subversives. It has always been
recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is
exercised under the direction of the Attorney General.
Investigation is performed by men a majority of whom are
under the direction of lawyers in the Justice Department,
and the information compiled is only usable and effective
through court action. The FBI is powerless to imprison
or to affect his liberty in any way except through the
action of the courts.

As to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of
informants, it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionable.
See Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (E.D. Va. 1971) (police
surveillance of street demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment
rights).

The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S., 385 U.S. 293 (1966), held
that the use of secret informants is "not per se unconstitutional", and does
not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, nor
the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,
admission at trial of evidence obained by an undercover informant to whom
a defendant spoke without knowledge that he was in the employ of the police.
385 U.S. at 300-303. See also Lewis v. U.S., 385 U.S. 206 (1966) and
Lopez v. U.S., 373 U.S. 427 (1963).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Moreover, the Supreme Court in U.S. v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971), recently held that the use of secret informants does not violate any constitutionally justifiable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, even when an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit his conversations with defendants to other agents.

If the use of undercover government informants without a warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment and invade a defendant's constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, Hoffa v. U.S., supra, and such informants may write down their conversations with defendants and testify concerning them, or simultaneously record and transmit such conversations to others, who may testify against them, On Lee v. U.S., 343 U.S. 747 (1952); U.S. v. White, supra, then clearly mere visuai "surveillance" of plaintiffs in plain view by informants at public meetings would not violate their constitutional rights.

It would seem that those who elect to present their views actively in the public arena deliberately expose themselves to the public. See Associated Press v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130 (1967). Any recording of their activities by the defendants does not invade their privacy any more than does a newspaper, radio, or television story, and, indeed, much less since any information compiled is usable and effective only through court action. Tatum v. Laird, 444 F2d 947, 957 (D.C. Cir. 1971).

More difficult questions are presented where the investigation delves into the private affairs of the individuals or organizations. But even here, the courts have generally sustained our procedures so long as they comport with the restrictions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee, et. al. v. J. Edgar Hoover.
et. al., 70 Civ. 2046 HRT, decided February 16, 1972. (examination of bank records) U.S. v. Gerhart, 275 F. Supp. 443 (S. D. W. Va. 1967) (examination of bank records); Minker v. U.S.. 312 F2d 632 (3d Cir. 1962) (trash covers); Cohen v. U.S., 378 F2d 751 (9th Cir. 1967) (mail covers);
U.S. v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U.S. 249 (1970) (detention and examination of packages in the mail); Mancusi v. DeForte, 392 U.S. 364 (1968) (seizure of union records); Hoffa v. U.S., supra; U.S. v. White, supra; (use of informants).

Re: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

In summary, it is premature to say that the First Amendment line of cases, dealing with the "chilling" concept offers any substantial impediment to our intelligence investigations. There is less reason for optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. We should be prepared, therefore, to meet arguments regarding the need for outside supervision. The sound answer, which should satisfy governmental needs and individual rights, is found in tight internal controls and carefully developed guidelines.

# INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION

The FBI's intelligence function is well established and documented. Yet, our work in gathering intelligence has been the subject of continuing criticism from segments of the press with charges being made that the FBI is conducting without authority security investigations of persons who are not in violation of the law. It has also been charged that our intelligence collection is uncontrolled, capricious and dwells on personal idiosyncrasies without there being any security interest involved. Fragments of information, distorted and twisted to convoy the false impression that the FBI is wantonly disregarding the privacy of citizens, have been published.

The FBI does not conduct security investigations of individuals without clear-cut authority and tight controls. Critics have taken fragments of intelligence which have come to their attention and built them up into what is represented as the end product of security investigations with political overtones. In these instances, the items upon which such importance was placed have been fragmentary intelligence from substantive


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

investigations and could not be viewed in their real significance, except as they fit into the overall perspective of the case. This is indicative of the danger of using piecemeal intelligence taken out of context; properly used, however, intelligence is a legitimate and necessary part of all security investigations.

Intelligence is information and the collection of it is inseparable from efficient investigative operations. In fact the two-investigation and intelligence--are mutually dependent.

In the security field, it is vital that the Federal Government detect factors which have a direct bearing on poihin lationen? low related to the overthrow on Anstruction of the Government. Intelligence developed to identify individuals who have a propensity for revolutionary er racial violence or have caffiliations with subversive or revolutionary groups is essential in the enforcement of the laws designed to protect the integrity of the Government. Intelligence is also essential to the detection of attempts or conspiracies to move against the Government, actions which may themselves be crimes.

No constitutional provisions, statutory enactments or judicial rulings have attempted to deprive law enforcement of its intelligence function, although various attempts have


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

been made to define or limit the areas encompassed by Intelligence and particularly the techniques of collection. It is also recognized that some intelligence gathering activities may have an incidental "chilling" effect on individual citizens. The spectre of the Government's investigatory presence may cause a reaction in citizens, inhibiting the exercise of their full constitutional rights. Therefore, a balance between the requirements of the Government and the constitutional rights of citizens must be maintained.

The intelligence function of investigation, must be both reasonable and practical. It varies in scope and intensity with the seriousness of the provision it seeks to enforce. It is neither reasonable nor practical to launch an aggressive intelligence collection effort concerning the activities of those who might potentially violate a local antilittering ordinance. Detection of a conspiracy to bomb the White House, on the other hand, certainly justifies a continuous and intensive intelligence effort to identify the participants and gain knowledge of any specific plans.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

It is mandatory that a Government protect its integrity and this has been recognized by judicial authorities. Ordinary crimes victimize an individual or groups; crimes against the existence of the government victimize society. Carrying these crimes to their ultimate produces the ultimate crime against society--the destruction of that society.

It is clear that the aspirations of most revolutionary groups far exceed their capability to achieve their ultimate objectives. They are, however, quite capable of eroding the integrity of the democratic system by lesser acts and, if not discouraged or thwarted, might woll accumulate tho will and power for more decisive action. The dramatic success of the Castro revolution is a sufficient example. Consequontiy, continuing intelligence collection relating to all revolutionary individuals and organizations, commensurate with the immediate threat posed, is imperative to proper vigilance.

The FBI serves as a prime producer of intelligence for the Executive Branch. Over the years it has provided information concerning hostile actions directed against the U. S.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 76

by foreign governments, their intelligence services and others acting in their behalf. On the domestic scene the FBI has penetrated conspiracies ranging from the communist underground to the hooded night riders of the Klan who terrorized our black citizens. But, in the 1960's explosive changes occurred In the internal security problems faced by the country. These changes were reflected in both the scope and nature of the FBI's response and in the intelligence requirements levied upon the FBI by the Executive Branch.

In the decade of the '60's, social change and upheaval added to the critical areas of the FEI's intelligence responsibilities the problems of revolutionary and extremist activities. America was stunned by violent student disruptions, bombings and riots. Spanning the decade were civil rights protests, reactions against them, and tragically, the burning and looting of Watts in 1965 and the conflagrations in Detroit, Newark and Washington, D. C. And, what had been the youthful idealism of the emerging new left in the 1962 Port Huron Statement was drowned out by the obscene Weatherman war cries


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 77

as they took their revolution to the streets of Chicago in 1969 during their "Days of Rage."

As the tide of crime and disruption swelled, it brought with it new and pressing problems on the domestic security scene. FBI domestic security investigations increased accordingly. There was also an immediate increase in FBI intelligence collection concerning the lawlessness and violent tactics of these emerging revolutionary elements.

Intelligence collection was essential in contending with these new domestic security problems. This fact was recognized by the reports of two Presidential Commissions. The report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (Kerner Commission, 1968) stressed that the absence of accurate information before and during disorders created special control problems. It emphasized that law enforcement organizations must develop the means to obtain adequate intelligence for planning purposes and that law enforcement should "gather, evaluate, analyze and disseminate information on potential as well as actual civil disorders."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

Similarly, the President's Commission on Campus Unrest (1970) took special note of the need for intelligence in effective law enforcement. The Commission stated in its report, "It is an undoubted fact that on some campuses there are men and women who plot, all too often successfully, to burn and bomb, and sometiner to main and kill." The report concluded that the beat, AND sometimes the only, means law enforcement has to thwart or prevent such plots is through "clandestine intelligence work."

Provention is the very essence of the proper uso of intelligence. To be forewarned is to be placed in a position to carry out countermeasures to meet a threat. During the mass actions and violent confrontations of the 1960's, FBI intelligence collection was crystallized in dissemination of information to other government agencies. This intolligence provided them with an essential working tool to contend with public disorders and activities of a revolutionary nature.

In a memorandum to the Director of the FBI, 9/14/67, Attorney General Clark stressed the importance of intelligence. The Attorney General asserted. "It is most important that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

you use the maximum available resources, investigative and intelligence, to collect and report all facts bearing upon (riot activity)." Elaborating on this point, he said, "In these circumstances we must be cortain that every attempt is boing made to got all information bearing upon thess problows; to take every step possiblo to deteraine whether the rioting is pro-planned or organized; and, if so, to determine the identity of the people and interests involved; and to deter this activity by prompt and vigorous legal action." The Attorney General's evaluation of the importance of intelligence in this instance applies with equal force to other areas of the FBI's security work.

In December, 1967, the Department of Justice, aware of the high priority of intelligence in dealing with civil disorders, crcated the Inter-Division Information Unit. This is a repository for "reports which relate to individual or organizational activities which may play a part in instigating or spreading civil disorders" and includes intelligence "relating to black power and black nationalist organizations,"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 80

officers and members thereof, racial incidents throughout the country, and any specific demonstrations which are being planned and are of such nature as to render them subject to the possibility of violence." Quick retrieval of this intelligence was emphasized through the use of computers.

Attorney General Mitchell wrote to the FBI Director on May 17, 1971, concerning the Intelligence Evaluation Committee, created to analyze and evaluato intelligence for the guidance of the White House and other departments of the Executive Branch. In this memorandum, the Attorney Goneral stated, "Intensified activities on the part of militant groups here in Washington, D. C., and elsewhere in the country clearly point up the need not only for the gathering of the highest quality intelligence available but also for an expert analysis and evaluation of the intelligence product itself."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 85

## IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTHORITY

The criteria and guidelines for FBI investigations are furnished to the field in a "Manual of Instructions," the "F. B. I. Handbook," and in Letters to all Special Agents in Charge. In addition, instructions and guidance are given to the field in Headquarters communications on specific cases. Compliance with criteria and guidelines is obtained by supervision in both the field and at Bureau Headquarters. In addition, regular inspections of field and Headquarters Divisions assure that Bureau policies concerning investigations are being followed.

In the security field, the basic responsibility of the FBI is to investigate revolutionary organizations dedicated to the violent overthrow or destruction of the United States Government. These include old-line Marxist groups, for example, the Communist Party, USA, and the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party; and such new revolutionary groups as the Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panther Party and the Weatherman. In the investigation of subversive individuals a determination is made of the dangerousness of the individual and efforts are made to obtain evidence of violations of any applicable

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 86

Federal, laws. To assist in cataloguing the level of dangerousness of those individuals and to retrieve quickly information concerning them, the Domestic Intelligence Division maintains a card file known as the Administrative Index.

"Administrative Index

Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (Emergency Detention Act) before it was repealed on September 25, 1971, provided for emergency detention of subversive individuals in the event of a national emergency.

To implement that provision of the act, the FBI and the Department of Justice maintained the Security Index. This Index was, of course, discontinued with the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act. By memorandum of October 22, 1971, however, the Attorney General noted that the repeal of Title II "does not alter or limit the FBI's authority and responsibility to record, file and index information secured" in this field and concurred in the establishment of an administrative index to assist in "making readily retrievable and available the results of its (the FBI's) investigations into subversive activities."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 87

To this end, such an index (called Adex) was instituted for making quickly retrievable information on four categories of individuals in order of dangerousness:

I) National leaders of revolutionary or extremist groups, members who have exhibited a propensity for violence, members with training in sabotage, espionage, or guerrilla warfare, unaffiliated revolutionaries with a propensity for violence, and revolutionaries with access to key facilities.

II) Secondary leadership of revolutionary and extremist groups, active members of these groups, and unaffiliated revolutionaries or extremists with a propensity for violence against property rather than persons.

III) Rank-and-file members of revolutionary groups within the previous five years, leaders of fronts for revolutionary groups, and individuals with revolutionary ideologies likely in a national emergency to commit acts of espionage, sabotage, or terrorism.

IV) Persons likely to assist, financially or otherwise, revolutionary groups, or persons in a position to influence others to commit acts inimical to the national defense. Investigation of an individual is conducted to determine whether or not he should, consistent with the criteria of these categories, be listed on the Adex. If, as


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 88

the result of the investigation, it is determined he does not meet the criteria the case is closed. If, on the other hand, ho does meet the criteria, he is listed in the Adex according to the determined degree of dangerous-ness. Category I cases continue under investigation for as long as the individual cops to warrant that Category listing. When an individuals fisted in Categories II, III, and IV, however, the investigation is closed, subject to periodic reopening to verify his location, to determine his activities and to ascertain whether he still qualifies for amciusior in the Ariex. Provision is made for upgrading, downgrading and purging an individual from the Adex as his activities and level of dangerousness fluctuate.

## Revolutionary Groups

Investigations of individuals for a determination of whether or not they meet the criteria for Adex generally involve their degree of affiliation with revolutionary and extremist groups. The purpose of investigations of basic revolutionary and new-left type groups is to: (1) provide intelligence to the Executive Branch which will enable the President to fulfill his Constitutional responsibilities;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 89

(2) detect developing conspiracies to violate substantive laws and initiate prosecutive action whenever possible to prevent such conspiracies from being carried out; and

(3) develop evidence necessary for the Attorney General to file petitions before the Subversive Activities Control Board in accordance with provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and Executive Order 11605.

The criteria, guidelines and restrictions on the investigations of revolutionary groups are outlined below:

Investigation is initiated upon receipt of information indicating that organization auruvaies vition of Government on engages in activity to deny others their Constitutional or statutory rights.

Investigation is conducted to establish aims and objectives, location and size, domination and control by hostile foreign power, identities of all leaders and members..

In regard to their front groups and organizations which they have infiltrated:

Investigation is initiated upon receipt of information that organization is dominated, controlled or influenced to substantial degree by revolutionary organization.

Investigation is conducted to determine degree of infiltration, aims and objectives, location and size and identities of all leaders.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 90

# Extremist Groups

The purpose of investigations of white hate and black extremist organizations is to: (1) provide intelligence to the Executive Branch which will enable the President to fulfill his Constitutional responsibilities; and (2) detect developing conspiracies to violate substantive laws and initiate prosecutive action whenever possible to prevent such conspiracies from being carried out. Investigations of white hate groups are confined to those which have actually or allegedly committed or have conspired to commit acts or violence or have adopieů a policy of advocating er inciting the use of violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution. Investigations of black extremist organizations concern those groups which take extremist, anti-U. S. Government, anti-white positions and whose activities have involved them or may involve them in civil unrest and/or subversive activity.

## Subversive, Revolutionary and Extremist Individuals

Individuals referred to as subversives are generally affiliated with old-line basic revolutionary organizations; those termed revolutionaries are usually new left types; and those called extremists are fundamentally


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 91

involved in violent or revolutionary activities based on race. Procedures for the investigation of these types of individuals are similar and the criteria are outlined as follows:

Membership in a basic revolutionary organization

Espousing the TIME OF REVOlutionary movements

Special training *alkene*, or leadership training, in a revolutionary group

Individuals having access to key facilities who have been members of a revolutionary group at any time

Persons with revolutionary, terrorist, anarchistic or extremist beliefs who are likely to seize upon a national emergency to endanger public safety

Individuals who have actually or allegedly committed, conspired to commit, or adopted policy to commit acts of violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution

Extremists and revolutionaries who have demonstrated a propensity for violence, have involved or may involve themselves in civil unrest, or who advocate violent overthrow of the Government

Persons who influence others to engage in acts inimical to the national defense or who are likely to furnish financial or other assistance to revolutionary or extremist elements because of their sympathies, associations or ideologies

-- 20 --


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 92

# Unaffiliated Individuals

In the areas of revolutionary (new left) and extremist activities, some investigations are conducted of individuals who are not affiliated with organizations. Investigation of an individual is undertaken when information is received that the person:

*   Is a revolutionary and adheres to the Weatherman ideology of advocating a revolution now and uses terrorist tactics in furtherance of revolution
*   Is a revolutionary or extremist and demonstrates by acts or statements propensity for violence against property
*   Exhibits revolutionary or extremist ideology and is likely to seize opportunity in national emergency to commit espionage, sabotage, terrorism or otherwise interfere with Federal or local governments or defense efforts
*   Influences others to engage in acts inimical to national defense or likely to furnish financial or other assistance to revolutionary or extremist elements

## Espionage and Foreign Intelligence Investigations

The mission of the FBI in the foreign intelligence field is one of counterintelligence. The objectives and priorities of counterintelligence have been variously stated and evaluated. Generally, these objectives may be listed in declining priority as follows: (1) the detection and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

identification of intelligence operations and agents;

(2) the penetration of these operations for the purpose of control and the development of intelligence information;

(3) neutralization of hostile intelligence operations through disruption and disinformation; and, (4) prosecution. Whatever the assigned priority, the overall objective is to deny access to information sought by whatever practical means are available.

Foreign intelligence investigations are grounded in the Espionage statute and related laws including the Registration and Atomic Energy Acts. Individual investigations are initiated usually on the basis of a known or suspected connection with a foreign intelligence service, foreign country or subversive organization with such connections. Since these investigations emanate from various sensitive sources and involve special considerations, extensive criteria and limitations are defined and enumerated in current instructions. In general terms, the governing criteria are designed to preclude initiation and continuance of investigations which are not justified. The limitations are designed to control the scope of investigation in order to insure security of our interests through close supervisory scrutiny.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 94

# Restrictions on Investigations

FBI guidelines go beyond the rules for opening, investigating and closing cases; they also impose restrictions to make certain that we do not violate the constitutional rights of any individual and to preclude investigations from becoming "fishing expeditions." In the security field these are some of the restrictions which are applied:

Security cases are evaluated continually to determine if we are fulfilling our responsibilities. Those cases not warranting further investigation are closed promptly.

There are no investigations of members of an organization which does not advocate use of force to bring about existing changes in the Government. Examples are the Socialist Party, the Independent Workers of the World and Independence Party of Puerto Rico.

Persons arrested during disruptive demonstrations are identified since circumstances of an arrest, in some cases, may indicate a propensity for violence. However, a mere arrest in connection with a demonstration is an insufficient basis in itself for security investigation. The arrest must be coupled with a demonstrated propensity for violence or with subversive or revolutionary activity on the part of the individual arrested.

When it is determined that a security subject is a member of the armed services, the investigation is discontinued immediately and the military advised.

Civil rights organizations are not investigated.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 95

Ambassadors or heads of permanent missions to the United Nations are not investigated.

No surveillances are conducted at the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court, the House and Senate Office Buildings or the United Nations.

No telephone or microphone surveillances are operated without prior written approval of the Attorns: General.

Bureau authority is REQUIRED. I for:

Investigations of officials and diplomatic representatives of foreign countries. (Department of State authority is also required.)

: Investigation of communist infiltration of a political organization.

Developing sources connected with an institution' of learning.

Interviews of subjects of active, current security investigations.

Investigations of faculty members. If approval is granted, only established sources functioning in an administrative capacity may be contacted on the campus. Other established sources and informants must be contacted away from the campus. Contacts with students, graduate students and faculty members must alse have Bureau I authority.

Interviews of labor Leaders and persons in educational, mass media or publishing fields.

These examples demonstrate a consciousness of the need to impose limitations on investigations and the continuing imposition of them.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 96

# Information Storage and Retrieval

The storage and retrieval of information is a baste operational necessity of any investigative or intelligence-gathering agency. Procedures within the FBI for these functions provide for written records of information received from a variety of sources--confidential informants, confidential INVESTIGATIVE techniques, and open sources--and the storage of this information in different types of files. These include active investigative files on organizations and individuals and some general files. These "raw" files are maintained both at the Seat of Government and in the various field offices. Information in the files is thoroughly indexed so that data can be retrieved.

In the intelligence field, when an allegation within the jurisdiction of the FBI is received, a case on an individual or on an organization may be opened, depending on the quality of the allegation. Nonspecific information that is received on an individual or organization is placed in the pertinent file, if one exists, or is placed in a general file if the organization or individual is not the subject of a specific file.

-- 25 --


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 97

These files are an integral part of the intelligence-gathering function. By the very nature of the FBI's assignment to coordinate internal security information, the maintenance of data over a period of time is required and it is necessary that a system for retrieving this information be used.

Because these files OFTEN contain derogatory information that may not be substantiated by further investigation (the derogatory information received may not be germane to a matter within the FBI's jurisdiction), the Attorneys General have long taken the position that these files should not be available for public scrutiny. Incalculable damage to individual reputations could result from the disclosure of single items of information without knowing the full background concerning the receipt of a particular item and the context within which it was recorded.

The late Justice Robert Jackson, in his capacity as Attorney General, wrote in 1941:

Disclosure of information contained in the reports (FBI files) might also be the grossest kind of injustice to innocent individuals. Investigative reports include leads and suspicions. And sometimes even the statements of malicious or misinformed people. Even though later and more complete reports exonerate the individuals, the use of particular or selected reports might constitute the grossest injustice, and we all know a correction never catches up with an accusation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

# Dissemination

The Bureau's general policy on dissemination is that information developed by or coming to the attention of the FBI is promptly referred to all agencies of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government having a potential interest in it or responsibility for taking action concerning it, WHENEVER THE interest or responsibility is apparent or known. This policy is in accordance with numerous formal agreements entered into between the Bureau and other Government agencies. It is also in accordance with Presidential directives obligating the Bureau to act as clearing house for information affecting the internal security of the U. S.

Despite this general liberal policy of dissemination, we have recognized that with regard to highly sensitive information a determination must be made on an individual basis as to what information should be disseminated and how it should be transmitted. The degree of sensitivity and/or the security classification will determine level of dissemination to any interested agency and the method of transmittal. In certain instances, sensitive information may be furnished to a high-level official with a request that dissemination in his agency be restricted to his personnel on a need-to-know basis. Such information might be disseminated by secure teletype, courier, liaison, and where necessary, by secure telephone. Information furnished orally is confirmed in writing.

The Attorney General
Director, FBI

SCOPE OF FBI JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

During our meeting on July 26, 1973, you referred to a discussion you had with Senator Charles McC. Mathias, Jr., of Maryland during your confirmation hearings as to the statutory authority of the FBI and the Department of Justice in the field of domestic intelligence investigations. You then asked Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus to work with the FBI in weighing the pros and cons with regard to statutory authority in this area. I mentioned that research was being performed on this subject at the present time and that we would be in touch with Mr. Ruckelshaus with regard to this matter when we have completed the results of our consideration and findings within the FBI.

Actually, a study has been going on in the FBI for more than two years as to the scope of FBI jurisdiction and authority, in domestic intelligence investigations. When Mr. L. Patrick Gray, III, was designated as Acting Director of the FBI, he instructed that a position paper be prepared concerning the jurisdiction and authority of the FBI to conduct domestic intelligence investigations. A position paper was prepared which in essence stated that authority of the FBI in this field is based on legislative enactments, even though we may have publicly relied heavily on Presidential directives as the basis for such authority. Mr. Gray ordered an in-depth study made of the position and in August, 1972, a detailed report was furnished to him. The following is a summary of that report.

Over a period of several months there were a number of public statements questioning authority and jurisdiction of the FBI to conduct domestic intelligence-type investigations, particularly where there is no clear-cut legislative authority apparent. One of the most searching inquiries was contained in a paper presented by Professor John T. Cliff at a two-day conference at Princeton University in October, 1971, sponsored by the Committee for Public Justice.

# The Attorney General

A major thrust of Professor Elliff's paper concerned FBI authority derived from legislative enactments as opposed to that derived from Presidential directives, beginning with a directive issued by President Roosevelt in September, 1939. Professor Elliff is of the opinion that the 1939 directive, which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions, was magnified by the FBI from its original purpose to a definitive order to conduct intelligence-type investigations.

Senator Sam J. Ervin, as you know, had been probing into the nature and extent of FBI intelligenco-type investigations. Senator Ervin had even announced that he intended to propose legislation to prohibit the FBI from investigating any person without that individual's concent, unless the Government has reason to believe that person has committed a crime or is about to commit a crime. Other Congressmen indicated a similar interest in FBI investigative activitios.

Our study revealed that the FBI had declared publicly over a long period of time that its responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field are authorized under legislative enactments, Presidential directives, and instructions of the Attorney General, The Presidential directives are obviously the 1) directive dated September 6, 1939, and reiterated January 8, 1943; July 24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, and 2) Executive Order 10450 dated April 27, 1053 (and amended but not yet implemented by Executive Order 11005 dated July 2, 1971).

In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated September 6, 1939, and considering that the subsequent directives are all hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the FBI by these directives. It appears that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FBI to handle espionage, sabotage, and neutrality matters, it did not convey any authority or jurisdiction which the FBI did not already have from legislative enactinents. It is difficult to read into this directive or in any of those which followed any authority to conduct intelligence-typo investigations which would or could not be conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 101

# The Attorney General

As a matter of historical fact, President Roosevelt in August, 1936, did request formor Director. Edgar Hoover to conduct investigations of subversive activities in this country, including communism and fasciem. This request, however, was a confidential oral request and there is doubt that any record of it was made outside the FBI. This request, or Presidential mandato, was based, incidentally, on the fact that the law provided that the FBI could conduct such invostigations if the Secretary of State should so request.

The study revealed that while the 1939 et seq. directives did not grant any special intelligence-gathering authority to the FDI, we were responsible under those directives to aciloct all intelligence information furnished by local, state, and Federal law enforcement agencies and patriotic citizens and to sift and coordinate all such information for indications of subversive activity covered by Federal statutes,

The study concluded that the FDI has the responsibility to conduct whatever investigations are neaussary to determine if statutes relating to espionage, sabotage, insurrection or rebcilion, sedition, seditious conspiracy, advocacy of overthrowing the Government, and other such crimes affoeting the national security have been vicleted. In this connection we note that in a letter dated September 14, 1987, the Department of Justice advised that the FBI is continually alert to the problem of recurring riots and is submitting intelli,rence reports to the Lepertment of Justice concerning such activity. This letter enumerated several Federal statutes and stated these could be applicable in using maximum available resources, investigative and intelligence, to collect and report all facts bearing on the question of schemos or conspiracies to plan, promote or eggravato riot activity.

In other words, the Department was roquesting all possible intelligence-type invectigalive cctivity based on the existence of certain statutes. We see this as being no different from our intelligence-type investigations relating to plans of groups or individuals to overthrow, destroy, interfere with or threaten the survival of effective operation of national, state, and local governments.

-3-

NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 101


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 102

# The Attorney General

Based on this study, we believe that had there never been a single one of the Presidential directives in question the FDI would have conducted and will, through necessity, continue to conduct the same intelligence-type investigations es were conducted from 1939 to the present date. We also believe, however, that in order to counter the criticism and skepticism of such individuals as Professor Elliff and Senator Sam J. Ervin that an up-to-date Exccutive order should be issued clearly establishing a need for intolligence-typa investigations and delineating a clear authority for the FBI to conduct such investigations based on guidelines established by the Attorncy General and adhering to constitutional principles.

The study concluded with two basic recommendations.

1) That the Department of Justice be requested to sponsor comprehensive legislation spelling cut the Fol's investigative nuthority in the collection of Intelligence information reining in its una scurity and; 2) that the Department of Justice be requested to seck a comprehensive Executive order which would cover any posille gap between statutory authority and Executive necessity in protection of the national security.

At first glance these recommendations may appear to contradict our position that we already, have statutory authority to conduct security-type investigations; that this being the case we do not need additional legislative enactments, nor do we need an Executivo order. But being realistic we think that the basic statutos upon which we rely for our authority to conduct domestic intelligence investigations need to be updated to fit 1973 noeds. Title 15 U.S.C. Sections 2333, 2384, and 2335 relate to the national security, but the legislative history of 2363 and 2384 indicates that they were designed for the Civil War era, not the I wentieth Century, and Section 2385 has been reduced to a fragile shell by the Supreme Court. These statutes are unquestionably still valid, but updating is certainly indicated. The bills introduced as II.1. 6046 and S. 1400 in the 93rd Congress appear to contain language which should fill our statutory necds, except perhaps for those groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, which do not beck to overthrow the Government, but nevertheless are totalitarian in nature and seek to deprive constitutionally guaranteed rights.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 103

The Attorney General

As to the need for an Executive order, we think that two issues are involved. We have statutory authority, but what we need is a definitive requirement from the President as to the nature and type of intelligence data he requirca in the pursuit of his responsibilities based on our statutory authority. In other words, there is a need, from cur standpoint, for both authoritative and definitive guidelines. The statutes give us the authority. The Executive order would define our national security objectives.

Members of Congress, including such men as Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, have proposed legislation to spell out jurisdiction and authority of the FEI in this field. It would appear that the President would rather spell out his own requirements in an Executive order instead of having Congress tell him what the FBI might do to help him fulfill his obligations and responsibilities as President.

The political climate of suspicion and distrust resulting from disclosures coming out of the Watergate hearings could present an obstacle to getting any such Executive order signed in the immediate future. However, the rationale is nevertheless valid and when scrutinized closely, the language in the Executive order we hereinafter propose establishes definitive guidelines which have heretofore been unclear. It is my belief that we should go forward with this.

We therefore propose and recommend that an Executive crder along the following lines be submitted to the White licuso with a strong recommendation for approval. The language which follows is merely to illustrate the type of Executive order which we think would be appropriate and does not necessarily represent an ideal format or style which should be submitted to the White House.

**EXECUTIVE ORDER**

"Whereas the Constitution of the United States was established to insure, among other things, domestic tranquility; to provide for the common defense; and to promote the general welfare for the people of the United States:
and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

The Attorney General

"Whereas the President of the United States has the constitutionally imposed responsibility of defending the Constitution and the existence of the Government thereunder; and

"Whereas there have been continuing unlawful acts of violence perpetrated against the Government of the United States or against citizens of the United States or against persons entitled to the protection of the United States thereby endangering the domestic tranquility, threatening the common defense, and jeopardizing the genoral welfare of the people of the United States; and

"Whereas the Congress has enacted laws prohibiting acts such as treason, sedition, sabotage, espionage, insurrection and rebellion, seditious conspiracy, civil disobedience, rioting, assassination, kidnaping, deprival of civil rights, and conspiracies to commit such acts; and

"Whereas the President of the United States as Chief Executive in the maintenance of the Government thereunder must have intelligence information for appropriate decisions in the discharge of his constitutionally imposed responsibilities;

"Now by authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States and in the interest of orderly operation of this Government and in furtherance of the domestic tranquility, common defense, and general welfare of the people of the United States it is ordered that;

"The Attorney General prepare and issue guidelines, conforming to the principles of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and outlining the necessary direction, coordination, and guidance of investigations to assure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation provides on a continuing basis intelligence information essential to the execution of laws pertaining to sub- versive activity and other such activity affecting the national security, domestic tranquility, and general welfare of the United States."

The Nation has been going through a time of terror. The concept of urban guerrilla terrorism has been adopted by various extremist elements in the United States. Bombings of public buildings and national institutions;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

# The Attorney General

killing of police officers who, by their uniform, are a symbol of the democratic establishment; hijacking of aircraft in furtherance of revolutionary movements; terrorist assaults on foreign diplomatic personnel and establishments; and open declaration of war on our form of government are only a few of the violent acts which have been perpetrated by domestic subversives who seek to destroy or seriously cripple our Government. Terrorist guerrilla attacks which were once confined to far away places and related to problems of no immediate concern of ours are now possible in this country. Foreign terrorist groups in collusion with domestic terrorists have laid plans for an airport massacre of the type which recently occurred in Israel. Other foreign terrorist elements have laid plans for terrorist attacks on American soil. Already one foreign official has been assassinated, possibly by terrorists.

It would be folly to adopt an investigative policy based on the concept of investigation only when there is reason to believe a crimo involving the national security has been committed. The FBI must obviously anticipate the crimes described above. We believe that in order for the Covernment to be in position to defend itself against revolutionary and terrorist efforts to destroy it, the FBI must have sufficient investigative authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations not normally associated with eriforcement of the statutes. In other words we think the President has the inherent Executive power to expand by further defining the FBI's investigative authority to enable it to develop advance information concerning the plans and aspirations of terrorists and revolutionaries who seek to overthrow or destroy the Government. However, we also believe that such expanded authority must be formally set forth in an Executive order and that this recommendation is responsive in the Attorney General's expressed interest in laying more formal guidelines to our work in areas where definition is not now clear.

We consider the issuance of a new Executive order delineating cur jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intelligence information relating to the national security to be a very important and high priority matter. We believe the issuance of guidelines by the Attorney General under Title 28, Section 533, United States Code, to be equally important.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

# The Attorney General

For your information, our own investigative guidelines as contained in our Manual of Instructions relating to domestic subversive investigations have been completely rewritten to conform with the concept that our domestic intelligence-type investigations are based on Federal statutes. These guidelines provide that in each instance, the domestic intelligence investigation must be predicated on information indicating that the organization or individual is engaged in activity which could involve a violation of specific statutes relating to the national sccurity. A copy of the new guidelines was previously provided to the Department of Justice in connection with the request of Senator Edward M. Kennedy to obtain a copy of the FBI's Section 87 of the Manual of Instructions. The effective date of the new guidelines was August 1, 1973.

# ADDENDUM: LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION PVD:dkg 4-14-75

Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FDI, the Legal Comsel Division has the following observations:

(1) Eased on our analysis and conversations this Division has bad with Fred B. Criffith of the Inspection Division, it appears that the information contained in this memorandum may be classified confidential under Executive order 11652.

(2) Before making any determination as to whether wo make such information available to the Senate Celect Committee, it would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Cection of Intelligence Division, and requested he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and inst position that this information not be made available to the Committee or that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. Adams

FROM : Legal Counsel

DATE: 4-10-75

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

In connection with our investigations of staff members for captioned Committee, we have developed derogatory information on two individuals which has been brought specifically to the attention of William Miller, Staff Director of the Committee, One of these involved Mrs. Diane Eloise LaVoy whose sister-in-law questioned her loyalty and declared she "does not love America." The sister-in-law said Mrs. LaVoy constantly criticized the U. S. Government and its policy and underlying weaknesses of our society. Another individual said she was highly critical of CIA activities. This information was pointed out to Miller on 3-25-75 when the results of the investigation were delivered to him, and he also was advised that the CIA would be furnished the same data in accordance with our agreement concerning these matters.

On 3-24-75 and 3-28-75 results of the investigation concerning Mrs. Betty Dale Ellison were delivered to Miller and he was advised that a prior supervisor with eight years of training and experience in psychiatric care stater he felt Mrs. Ellison needs psychological examination. He termed her a trouble maker and said he would have fired her if he had the authority. He described her definitely as a security risk due to her mental and emotional instability. It also was pointed out to Miller that other former supervisors described her as unstable when working under pressure and unable to get along with fellow employees. Miller was told that this information also would be furnished to CIA.

On 4-2-75 Miller advised Inspector Bowers he had considered the matter involving Mrs. LaVoy and had discussed it with the Committee Chairman, and they had decided to proceed with her as a staff member since they did not feel the derogatory remarks by her sister-in-law were sufficiently strong enough to disqualify her since the remainder of the investigation was favorable.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Miller also advised on 4-2-75 that their review of the Ellison investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only real solution to the situation seemed to be that she not be added to the staff. Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard. This request was conveyed to CIA by Section Chief William Cregar of the Intelligence Division who subsequently advised that Charles Kane, Director of Security, CIA, had reviewed the file on Ellison and agreed there was sufficient cause to question her suitability for assignment to the Select Committee staff. Kane stated CIA Director Colby concurred in this observation.

These views were conveyed to Miller on 4-9-75. Miller stated at that time that they had resolved the situation by assigning Mrs. Ellison to purely administrative tasks and that she would be fully isolated from any sensitive or classified information in connection with her responsibilities.

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

On 3-19-75 Inspectors John B. Hotis, David W. Bowers, and Special Agent Paul V. Daly met with William Miller, Staff Director; Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr., Chief Counsel; and Michael T. Epstein of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff. During the meeting Mr. Schwarz requested a briefing be arranged for staff members of SSC concerning the operations of the Intelligence Division, that they be furnished copies of training documents pertaining to matters handled by the Intelligence Division, and that they be furnished a glossary of terms used in the intelligence field. He pointed out the aforementioned material would greatly assist in the SSC staff developing an understanding of the Intelligence Division operations and hopefully prevent misunderstandings or needless requests of the FBI.

Mr. Miller advised that Senators Frank Church and John Tower intended to contact the Director in the immediate future to discuss arrangements relating to the SSC's review of the FBI activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) Intelligence Division review and where possible make available training documents relating to training concerning Intelligence Division matters and a glossary of terms used in the intelligence field, or recommend a counter offer,

(2) Legal Analysis Office in conjunction with the Intelligence Division arrange a briefing for Senate Select Committee staff members.

Memorandum

DATE: 4/17/75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE

At 11:00 a.m. on April 17, 1975, Inspector John B. Hotis
Special Agent Paul V. Daly and I met with Deputy Attorney General Tyler
and Associate Deputy Attorney General James Hutchinson at the request
of the Deputy Attorney General.

Deputy Attorney General Tyler advised that he had been requested
by Burke Marshall and F.A.O. Schwarz, III, who are consultant and General
Counsel, respectively, for the Senate Select Committee, to meet with
him on Monday afternoon, April 21, 1975, to discuss matters relating
to the Committee's activities. The Deputy Attorney General said that he
has been personally acquainted with Mr. Marshall for a long time and also
is acquainted with Mr. Schwarz. He considered the possibility of having
a Bureau representative attend the meeting, but then decided it would be
best if he would meet with Marshall and Schwarz privately to determine
whether they desire to discuss details of the Committee's responsibilities
and if it became necessary, he would request the Bureau to send a
representative to the meeting.

The Deputy Attorney General said that he would, of course,
advise us orally or in writing of the results of his conference with Mr. Marshall
and Mr. Schwarz.

The Deputy Attorney General inquired as to the procedure
currently being employed in responding to the Committee's requests
and Inspector Hotis explained the current procedures. I mentioned to the
Deputy Attorney General the existence of the Ad Hoc Committee of
Intelligence Agencies and suggested to him that he might desire to designate
a representative to attend those meetings in order to be on notice as to the
policies being developed by the White House and the intelligence community
in responding to Committee requests. I explained to him that James
Wilderotter, formerly Associate Deputy Attorney General, was the

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Department's representative on the Committee, but he has now been reassigned to responsibilities at the White House. I told him that Assistant Attorney General Scalia had been scheduled to attend the last meeting of the Committee, although he was unable to attend. The Deputy Attorney General said that he would discuss with Mr. Scalia the possibility of having Mr. Scalia attend as the Department's representative.

I asked the Deputy Attorney General whether he was undertaking the principal responsibility in the Department for matters relating to the Senate Select Committee and other committees that may be inquiring into the FBI and he said that that was not clear as yet because the Attorney General has taken a personal interest in these matters and it appeared that the responsibilities are still fragmented within the Department. It was his opinion that the responsibilities should be centralized and he appeared to be willing to undertake that responsibility.

It was my impression that the Deputy Attorney General was interested in being of assistance to the FBI in these matters and expressed a willingness to cooperate by having the FBI participate as much as possible with the Deputy Attorney General.

Mr. William G. Miller is the Staff Director for the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to intelligence activities. On 10/5/73, representatives of our Washington Field Office, (WEO) interviewed Mr. Miller, with Bureau approval, relative to contacts he had had with members of the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C. At that time, Mr. Miller was the Director of the Special Senate Committee to Terminate the National Emergency. On that occasion he was most cooperative, and upon being advised that the FBI's interest in (5)Soviet Embassy personnel focused more on their personalities rather than Soviet policies per se, Mr. Miller agreed to be interviewed whenever the FBI felt such was necessary.

WFO has recently conducted an interview with Mr. Albert Ashton Lakeland, Jr., Executive Assistant to Senator Jacob Javits of New York, (relative to his pasi-con-tacts with Grigoriy A. Rapota, a former Third Secretary assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C. Rapota was a known officer of the Committee for State Security (KGB), Political Branch (PB), who was extremely active on Capitol Hill. In the course of the interview with Mr. Lakeland, he advised that among others Mr. William G. Miller was known to have had numerous contacts with Soviet Embassy personnel, although he was not able to state with certainty that Mr. Miller had been in contact with Rapota.

WFO has now requestedreau through the Legal Analysis Office obtain concurrence of the chairman of the aforementioned committee for of WFO to again interview Mr. Miller concerning his possible contact with

Rapota and possibly other Soviets. WFO has noted that
Mr. Miller is also known to have been in contact with
Aleksandr A. Kokorev, a First Secretary of the Soviet
Embassy, Washington, D. C., and a known officer of the
Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU). (5)

While Mr. Miller was most cooperative on the last
occasion he was interviewed by the FBI, it is noted he did
not provide any particularly significant information con-
cerning the Soviets with whom he had contacts(5) While it is
not known at this time whether he could presently provide
meaningful information, an interview with him at this time,
when he is now the Staff Director of the Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations, could well be untimely and
indiscreet.

ACTION:

(1) In view of impending contacts which will be
had by FBIHQ with Mr. Miller, the purpose of this memorandum
is to draw attention to the fact that Mr. Miller has had
[past contact with representatives of Soviet intelligence
services and may be continuing to have same. (5)

(2) If you agree, there is attached a communication
to WFO captioned, "Grigoriy A. Rapota; IS - R (SOVEMB-

at this time and instructs that office to promptly advise
FBIHQ of any additional contacts between Mr. Miller and
representatives of the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.,
which may come to its attention. (5)

1 - Each Assistant Director

My memorandum to you 4/10/75, tickler copies as above, advised of the formal establishment of a task force called Project Senstudy 75 for the purpose of implementing responses to requests for information from Senate and House Select Committees on Intelligence Activities.

From time to time, requests will be made of various Divisions at FBIHQ for assistance in preparing responses. The Office of Legal Counsel has already contributed considerably in support of Senstudy 75 and is an integral part of the Project.

In order that we may keep an up-to-date record of the cost to the Bureau in handling this Project, each Assistant Director is requested to effect the necessary procedures to maintain such records and by the third of each month furnish by routing slip to W. O. Cregar, Room 4063, JEH Building, the following information: (1) Name of Division reporting; (2) Month for which reporting, which will be month just ended; (3) Main days devoted to Project assistance, broken down by (a) Agent and (b) clerical, including GS level for both Agent and clerical. An example submitted by 5/3/75 would be as follows: (1) GID; (2) Report for 4/75; (3)(a) one-half day @ GS-16; one day @ GS-15; three days @ GS-14; (3)(b) two days @ GS-7; two days @ GS-5.

This is effective commencing 4/1/75 and first routing slip report due 5/3/75 will be for the month of April, 1975.

If a Division has not participated during the preceding month, merely submit a routing slip to this effect.

The cooperation of all is urged so that the necessary cost data may be compiled each month. It is recognized that exact figures will not be feasible and that estimates will be most practical and will suffice.

DATE: 4/10/75

1 - Mr. W. 0. Cregar

This memorandum records the formal establishment of a task force entitled Project Senstudy 75.

The concept behind the establishment of this Project is to develop a capability of implementing requests received from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible. We believe that by creating this facility we will be able to meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the exception of the research that will have to be done in the substantive Divisions.

While the Project will direct internal work and related liaison with the intelligence community and the White House staff, we envision the Legal Analysis Unit Office of Legal Counsel Division as continuing to be the primary point of direct contact with the Select Committees of the Congress. They will receive all requests and deliver all responses to these Committees. In addition, they will meet with the staffs of the Committees to insure the reasonableness of requests. If necessary, they will call upon the expertise of the substantive Division for determination as to whether a proposed request from the Committees can be responded to within a reasonable period of time and within the capabilities of the FBI's information retrieval system.

At the present time four Supervisors have been delegated to work exlusively on the Project. They are as follows:

The Project Manager will be Section Chief William O. Cregar, CI-2 Section, Intelligence Division. His duties will encompass the review of all incoming requests from the Select Committees in an effort to identify policy questions;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

Re: Senstudy 75

ambiguities requiring recontact with Committee staffs; the
assignment of research responsibilities to substantive Divisions;
following such responsibilities to insure timely responses;
as well as representing the FBI on the Executive Committee
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional Review of
the Intelligence Community. Assistant Director John A. Mintz is
also a member of the Executive Committee. This latter responsi-
bility will provide Cregar and Mintz with direct liaison not
only with senior officials of the intelligence community but
also with the President's counsel.

Mr. Elmer W. Larson, Unit Chief, Training Unit, IS-3
Section, Intelligence Division will act as Cregar's Number One
Man; will administer the work of the Project; and act in the
absence of Cregar.

Seymor F. Phillips, Unit Chief, Civil Disorders
Reporting Unit, IS-1 Section, Intelligence Division will serve
as the Review Coordinator for the Project. His responsibilities
will be to review all research; coordinate all responses; be
available to consult with substantive Divisions as to proper
form of our responses; identify any conflicts in FBI positions
where several Divisions are responding to a particular question;
as well as to insure the quality, completeness and adequacy
of responses to Select Committees requests. Additionally,
Phillips will be responsible for the preparation of abstracts
to be furnished to the Interagency Registry maintained at CIA
Headquarters. This Registry established by the Executive Committee
of the Ad Hoc Group at the suggestion of and with the concurrence
of the White House will serve as the coordinating mechanism
for the entire intelligence community.

Mr. Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Officer with CIA, CI-4
Section, Intelligence Division will function as the Liaison
Officer with the intelligence community responsible for coordi-
nating and clearing all information under the third agency rule
where FBI responses are of interest to or are of a proprietary
interest to other agencies of the intelligence community. Schwartz
will serve as the Bureau's representative on the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 127

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

Because of the White House insistence that all requests and responses be completely coordinated and available for review by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project have a self-sustained records facility to insure immediate access to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select Committees. In addition, in those instances where certain FBI documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized (excised), it is imperative this records facility not only retain copies of the sanitized documents but also copies of the original text. For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project.

In addition to the above, there will be stenographic and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the work of the Bureau Supervisors. We have not committed any more personnel to the Project than are absolutely necessary at the present time. Should the requests of the Select Committees require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda will be submitted with a complete justification for additional personnel assigned to the Project.

Although the physical space for the Project is limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75 will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This space is physically located within the Intelligence Division.

As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should any member of the intelligence community get requests from other Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence community; could be of interest to the White House; or are of such sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the requests and an abstract of the responses should be made available to the Interagency Registry.

For information and record purposes.

BRIEFING FOR STAFF MEMBERS
BY INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
APRIL 11, 1975

As you were previously advised, William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, requested that we provide a briefing for certain staff members of the Committee on the functions of the Intelligence Division. He asked that the briefing cover both internal security and foreign counterintelligence operations and that it provide a broad overview of our investigative responsibilities.

The Intelligence Division is prepared to offer a two-hour briefing beginning at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, 4-11-75. It will include a slide show to be followed by a general discussion and an opportunity to afford questions and answers. After a luncheon break, the staff members will be given a brief tour of the Files and Communications Division.

Since the briefing will cover classified materials, no staff members will be invited unless they have appropriate security clearances. As a consequence Professor John Elliff, who has been tentatively named Director of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence, will not attend. It is hoped that we may provide him with a private meeting at some later date.

It is expected that those attending the briefing will include: Mr. Miller, F. A. O. Schwarz III, Chief Counsel, Mark Gitenstein and Marvin Epstein, staff members. Since no Committee members will be present, we are not recommending that the staff meet with the Director.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the above-named staff members of the Senate Select Committee be given a briefing by the Intelligence Division and the Files and Communications Division on 4-11-75.

Senator Church, according to this article, stated that the Committee is reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is accepting nothing with "strings attached."

Inasmuch as this Committee is also the Committee which the FBI is furnishing information to, it is believed a clarification of Senator Church's statement must be obtained and in the interim we should furnish the Senate Select Committee only those documents which do not have a caveat such as classified documents or documents bearing the property stamp.

Section Chief William O. Cregar advised that he had contacted Dr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Committee concerning Senator Church's reported statement. Clarke stated that CIA Director William E. Colby was highly upset at Church's remark and that this statement would be a topic of a discussion of the Executive Committee meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review the morning of 4-11-75. We will be represented at that conference by Section Chief William O. Cregar and Assistant Director John A. Mintz. Clarke indicated the position that the CIA will apparently take regarding this problem is that the White House should obtain the clarification although CIA Director Colby initially was prepared to send a letter over his signature to Senator Church to obtain such clarification.

Inasmuch as the request by this Committee was forwarded through the Department, Senator Church's statement was brought to the attention of Douglas Marvin, Assistant to the Attorney General, who has been handling all FBI responses to Senate Select Committee requests. Marvin indicated he was concerned at Church's statement and stated it was the Attorney General's desire that he be advised of any Bureau response to the Committee concerning this matter.

# Senate CIA Committee Says

# White House Stalls on Data

By George Lardner Jr.
Washington Post Staff Writer

The Senate Committee on Intelligence Operations disclosed yesterday that the White House is still stalling on a month-old request for the directives involving covert activities by the Central Intelligence Agency and other arms of the Government.

Sen, Frank Church (D-Idaho), the committee chairman, told reporters after a closed, 2½-hour meeting that he had been authorized to write another letter to President Ford asking him to expedite the request.

The committee asked Mr. Ford on March 12 for all the executive orders and top-secret National Security Council directives concerning the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community, including the command structure at the White House.

The President was also asked to supply the committee with a copy of CIA Director William E. Colby's January report to Mr. Ford on allegations of illegal domestic spying by the agency.

Church said, he did not know "what the hang-up is" since White House aides have indicated they consider the committee's entire request as "perfectly proper."

Church did not spell out all of "the more sensitive data" that is still being withheld, but he said it includes both the Colby report and the top-secret White House and National Security Council directives dealing with covert operations, both foreign and domestic.

The Idaho senator said the committee is reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is accepting nothing with "strings attached." But he declined to speculate on whether this might be the reason for the administration's hesitance. Church said all of the records were essential to the committee's mandate to investigate the CIA and the rest of the government's intelligence community. He said he still had no reason to think at this point that the White House would refuse to give them up, but he emphasized that he saw no reason for further delay.

But all the committee has gotten so far, Church said, has been what the White House evidently regards as the least sensitive documents on the list.

Church said, also authorized its staff of about 35 lawyers and investigators to start gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses as the prelude to a projected round of public hearings this summer. The House has also ordered a similar inquiry but its committee, headed by Rep. Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.), has yet to choose a staff director.

The Senate committee's chief counsel, Fritz Schwarz, said directors have now been named for all four of its task forces. They are William Bader, head of the foreign intelligence task force; John Eliff, head of the domestic intelligence task force; Alton H. Quanbeck, head of the Military intelligence task force, and David Aaron, head of the task force that will study the intelligence community's 'command and control structure."

Bader is a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide and has recently been working with the Ford Foundation. Elliff is a Brandeis University professor and expert in domestic law enforcement activities. Quanbeck has been director of the Brookings Institution's defense analysis project and Aaron has served on the National Security Council staff.

Schwarz said that each of the task forces will cut across the lines of various intelligence agencies and focus on general avenues of inquiry, such as the "legal authority and legal restraints" for intelligence work; the targets and techniques of intelligence-gathering, counterintelligence and covert operations, and the question of who orders and controls those activities.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the EXCOM), held at CIA Headquarters on the morning of 4/4/75.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were Mr. Roderick Hills, Assistant Counsel to the President; Associate Deputy AG Wilderotter; Mr. John Clarke; as well as senior officials from Defense, Treasury, National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, and the Energy Research and Development Administration.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. Roderick Hills reported that he had a meeting with the Counsel and Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) to discuss having Legal Counsel present when members of a particular agency were being interviewed by SSC staff personnel. The essence of this meeting resulted in the SSC being receptive to such an arrangement but it would be incumbent upon each agency, department or bureau to negotiate the specific arrangements for such representation with the SSC. Hills also discussed the problem of the unknown employee or former employee who might request to be interviewed unbeknownst to the parent agency. It was suggested to the Counsel and Staff Director by Hills that such an employee be interviewed by only one staff member, that the staff member attempt to determine the scope of this individual's testimony and then the parent agency to insure the agency could provide advice as to the sensitivity of the unknown employee's testimony. No firm decisions were made but it would appear the Counsel and Staff Director will agree to allow Counsel to be present.

RE: SENSTUDY 75

testimony of a secret employee and following such testimony the employee will be allowed to meet with staff members of the SSC in an Executive Session. It is anticipated more definitive information on the final decisions regarding this aspect will be forthcoming from the White House.

The question was raised by the Bureau representative as to whether the Ad Hoc Group and/or the interagency registry should be notified as to requests members of the Intelligence Community receive from other Congressional committees. Mr. Wilderotter advised that this would be a judgment question; however, if a request from a Congressional committee other than the Select Committees impacted on the Intelligence Community, involve sensitive issues or would be of interest to the White House, such requests should be provided to the interagency registry along with an abstract of the response.

Attached is a list of those members of the SSC staff who have been certified for access to compartmented information. Also attached is a paper identifying 10 issues likely to grow out of Select Committee deliberations. The pencil notation in the right-hand column identifies those agencies of the Intelligence Community responsible for preparing a paper which addresses these issues. It is noted that issue identified as number eight is entitled, "Intelligence Files and Privacy." Mr. Colby asked that the FBI prepare this paper. Assistant Director Mintz advised that the Bureau has a study underway on this very subject and agreed that the Bureau would prepare this study. The deadline for completion of the study is 4/25/75.

Also attached is a copy of the survey of the SSC facility, Room G-308, Dirksen Building, covering all aspects of physical and technical security. None of the participants of the EXCOM had any objection to the facility and we presume the SSC will abide by the procedures outlined in the attached survey report.

Attached also for information is a draft of an employee notice and agreement concerning treatment of confidential material being considered by the SSC. It is to be noted that to date neither the Committee nor its staff has signed any such Secrecy Agreement.

# SURVEY REPORT

Senate Select Committee Facility
Dirksen Bldg. 1st & C Street, N. E.
Washington, D. C.

1. In response to a request from Mr. Ben Marshall, Security Director, Senate Select Committee, (tele. 224-1700) Messrs. Nicholas R. Zubon and Robert E. Burgener conducted a comprehensive security survey of the Senate Select Committee's Facility on 24 March 1975.

2. Mr. Marshall provided both a comprehensive tour of the facility and a detailed explanation of the operation.

3. The following are pertinent facts concerning the security procedures as related to the Senate Select Committee Facility:

## A. Type of Facility

The Committee is in the auditorium (Room G. 308) of the Dirksen Building at 1st and C Streets, N. E., Washington, D. C. Access to the auditorium is gained easiest by entering the building from the 1st and C Streets entrance. A 24-hour guard post is located just inside this entrance. The Select Committee facility is 40' east of the building guard post. It is nearly in direct line of sight, however, a foyer surrounded by a 6' high temporary partition precludes the auditorium entrance door from being visible. The entrance to the auditorium is protected by a 24-hour guard post.

The auditorium (Room G. 308) is approximately 100' long x 45' wide. The floor, ceiling and walls are made of 6" to 8" solid masonry. The ceiling has a false ceiling approximately 18" deep in which the air handling equipment and sundry other service components are housed. All major air handling equipment is on the roof above the auditorium. Access to the roof which is strictly controlled by the Director of Security, is gained by a stairway in the southeast corner of the auditorium. The sidewalls each have a 2' x 3' register approximately 12' above the floor through which


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 145

air is passed from the auditorium to the air handling equipment on the roof. These registers are solidly bolted into the walls.

The front of the auditorium (south wall) is covered by a large movie screen. To the right and left of the movie screen are two rooms 6' wide and approximately 15' long used by the research section clerical personnel. These rooms have countertop openings approximately 3' above the floor for access from within the auditorium. Countertop openings exist along both sidewalls for approximately three quarters of the length of the wall. The sidewalls have intercorridors on the opposite side of the countertops which have been converted into unpartitioned office space. The only reproduction machine, a xerox model 3100, is located in the west corridor. The east corridor has been converted into a compartmented information storage room and a compartmented document reading room. The Security Director indicated that he may move his office to the head of the compartmented reading room to provide a larger measure of access control to this sensitive area.

The auditorium has six wooden exterior doors, 7' high and 3" thick. The entrance door into the auditorium (west and north wall) will have an electrical push-button lock installed. A similar door in the east end of the north wall will be barred and bracketed on the inside to prevent unauthorized entry. The west wall has 2 exterior doors leading into the Capitol Police offices. The east wall has two exterior doors with one leading to the roof while the second door exits into the Capitol Police Garage. All exterior doors will be alarmed. The doors now have Yale 197 1/4 locks with the keys controlled by Mr. Marshall. The fire safety factor concerning these locked doors was discussed with him.

The auditorium has a small second floor area at the north end. Access is gained by two stairways on the east and west side of the auditorium. The second floor space consists of a large projection room, currently filled with projection equipment, and five small private film viewing rooms.

The five small rooms will be converted into witness interview rooms. The windows in each of these rooms will be covered during the stay of the Select Committee in the auditorium.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

## B. Access Controls

Access to the Dirksen Building is gained by either the main entrance on 1st and C Streets, ground level, or the Basement Tunnel Entrance at the rear of the building. Both entrances have a 24-hour guard post where persons entering are checked for identification. Brief cases and packages are processed through x-ray machines. Vendors entering the main entrance are checked for ID, however, all boxes are not checked.

Entry into the auditorium is controlled by a guard at the door. His instructions are that all persons entering must show an ID card. Visitors are permitted only by appointment. They are logged in and escorted at all times while in the auditorium. From 1800 hours Friday through 0800 hours Saturday, and from 1300 hours Saturday to 07.00 hours Monday everyone must sign the log in and out and show an ID. In the event an access problem arises at the guard post, regardless of the hour, Mr. Marshall is alerted.

## C. Guards

The Dirksen Building and the auditorium are protected by members of the U. S. Capitol Police Department. The Building has two 24-hour/7day-a-week guard posts at the entrances while the Senate Select Committee has one 24-hour/7 day-a-week guard post at the entrance and an after-hours roving patrol inside the auditorium. All police officers are well trained, wear the Capitol Police uniform and carry Smith and Wesson 38 caliber revolvers. After-hour patrols check all doors, the entire auditorium for classified material that may not have been secured, and the second floor hourly during the night. The guards on duty at the time of the survey were alert and responsive to their duties. During off-duty hours, guard supervisors make at least two unscheduled visits to the guard posts during each shift. In addition the guard at the stationary post has four telephones, two of which have a pickup and automatic ring feature with Capitol Police Headquarters. There will be no rotation of police officers during the occupancy of the Committee. The same officers will be assigned to these posts.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

## D. Alarms:

All exterior doors to the auditorium will have contact (microswitch) alarms. The Remington Rand safes, being obsolete, will be protected by a proximity alarm. The compartmented storage room and an adjacent reading area will be protected by a volumetric alarm. For fire protection a smoke detector/rate of rise alarm will be installed in the compartmented area. All alarms will enunciate at the guard desk at the entrance to the auditorium. The ADT Company will install and maintain the alarms.

## E. Safes

The facility has 22 safes. Sixteen 4-drawer Remington Rand Safes located below the movie screen. Three class six Mosler 5-drawer, two class 1 Diebold 2-drawer, and one class 2 Diebold four-drawer are located in the compartmented storage room. With the exception of the Remington Rand safes, all other safes are in good working order.

The safe combination and repairs are under contract with the Safemaster Company. The safe combinations were recently changed by that company. All safe combinations are under the control of Mr. Marshall. However, an assist on day-to-day operations is provided by Mr. Pat Shea, Assistant Staff Director, who acts as backup for safeguarding the combinations to the safes in the compartmented storage room. Messrs. Larry Kieves, John Petersen and Ms. Jan Orloff are backup for the combinations to the sixteen Remington Rand Safes. Mr. Marshall was given two change keys in the event he decides to change the combination himself should staff personnel rotate.

## F. Document Control

Incoming CIA documents will be delivered by Agency courier to the guard at the entrance door to the auditorium. The registry officer will receipt for them and take them to the Registry Section where all documents will be logged. Compartmented and Top Secret material will be taken to the Compartmented Storage Room and placed in a safe after it has been logged in Registry. Individuals, on an access list promulgated by Mr. Marshall draw the compartmented documents from the safes but must read them in the adjacent area dedicated for this purpose. Documents classified below TS/Codeword will


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

be stored in the Remington Rand safes. The documents in the Remington Rand safes can be drawn by anyone on the staff, but must be receipted for with the Registry Officer. The documents are to be read on the tables placed there for that purpose in the Research Section.

Further control of classified documents is directed through the assigning of a staff employee given responsibility for the reproduction of documents on the xerox machine. He will control the number of copies made on typewriters.

All classified material is secured in safes at the end of the working day.

## H. Classified Waste

It is estimated that one 50-pound bag of classified waste will be generated each week while the Committee is in session. Once the bag is filled with classified waste, it will be placed in the locked trunk of Mr. Marshall's automobile and taken to the Federal Reserve Building incinerator where he will witness destruction by burning. In the event this incinerator is booked to capacity, he will take the classified waste and burn it at the D. C. incinerator. Should either incinerator become unavailable to the Committee, Mr. Marshall was assured that CIA would consider assisting him in the secure disposition of Committee classified waste.

## I. Compartmented/TS Storage

A room dedicated as the codeword/TS storage room is in the northeast corner of the auditorium. Its five walls are solid masonry ranging from 6" to 8" thick. A 1/8" stainless steel door frame is bolted to the masonry walls. A prefabricated 9 gage wire cross-patch metal frame door is attached to the steel frame serving as access control to the dedicated room. The door will be secured by lock and key once classified material arrives for storage. This room will be alarmed.

## J. Telephone

The Facility has six standard telephones in the auditorium. Five of the telephones will be equipped with conversation


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

masking devices. A central switch installed ahead of the
telephone instruments will disconnect all telephones
simultaneously, should the need arise. The telephone system
is maintained by the local telephone company.

K. Security Briefings

All new members of the committee receive a thorough
briefing from Mr. Marshall on security procedures and
security responsibilities. Briefings are periodically
reinforced when conditions warrant.

L. Security Duty Check Procedures

Custodians secure the safe cabinets assigned to them,
i.e. Mr. Shea, codeword room, Messrs. Kieves, Petersen,
and Ms. Orloff, Research area. Mr. Marshall double checks
behind them. The custodian, Security Director and the
roving guard patrol check the entire auditorium to ensure
all classified material has been secured at the end of the
day.

M. Counteraudio Inspection

Mr. Marshall has taken action on this requirement and
continues to monitor this area to provide the Committee
with as much security protection against the Audio threat
as possible.

N. Shredder

The facility has one Destroyit Model 51 Shredder used
only for shredding the most sensitive documents. Other
documents are not shredded in this machine because of its
limited shredding capability.

O. General Observations

The security procedures implemented within the Senate
Select Committee facility are sufficient to provide a proper
environment for the protection of classified materials. The
survey officers were pleased with the security director's
dedication to the objective of providing the best security
possible for the Committee.

# NOTES FOR SESSION

In previous sessions we discussed the importance of highlighting issues likely to grow out of Commission or Committee deliberations. We observed that we should identify some of those on which a legal brief or annex would be helpful to Executive Branch initiatives. The idea was to select a few where a solid research paper with options, pros and cons, etc., could help us develop a firm grip on the questions in the issue and identify options. For example, the question of Executive privacy presents itself, and I gather is being worked on.

There are others we feel it would be useful for the group to address and assign responsibility for further work. For example:

1. Economic Intelligence and National Security--new discussion
2. Covert action and the law
3. The Intelligence Budget--open, black, or closed--rational and procedures for handling past, present and future
4. Joint Congressional oversight committee for Intelligence
5. GAO and the audit authorities of U.S. Intelligence Agencies
6. Confidential funds authorities, contingency reserves, legal base, history and uses
7. Cover for Foreign Intelligence Actions legal and administrative issues
8. Intelligence files and privacy
9. The "fact of" question--international, legal and political considerations
10. "Sources and methods" legislation

Director Sec'y

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the morning of 4/2/75.

The study prepared for the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) entitled, "Human Intelligence," has come to the attention of the Senate Select Committee (SSC). The major contributors to this report were the FBI and CIA. It is an extremely sensitive document and for that reason any requests from any committees of the Congress for copies of this report should be referred to the White House. At the present time, the consensus of those persons in the White House dealing with the subject of release of information to the committees of Congress is that this report will not be provided Congressional committees at this time.

The SSC does recognize a requirement to comply with the Third Agency Rule which states in effect that classified information or material originating in one department shall not be disseminated outside any other department to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating department. CIA's General Counsel has produced a paper entitled "The Third Agency Rule," copy attached, which they have requested be reviewed by the Legal Counsels of all agencies making up the Intelligence Community. A copy of CIA's paper referred to above has been made available to Assistant Director Mintz who has indicated he will be in direct contact with Mr. Warner, CIA'S General Counsel.

Attached is a copy of sanitization guidelines for documents provided Congressional Select Committees. The Grou1975 asked that these guidelines be reviewed and concurrence.

objections be furnished to the Security Committee of the
United States Intelligence Board (USIB) for consideration.
A copy of these guidelines has been furnished to the Freedom
of Information Unit of the Legal Counsel Division for review.
Their comments will be furnished to the Bureau's representative,
Mr. Frank Schwartz, on the USIB Committee in compliance with
the mandate from the Ad Hoc Group.

Also attached is a copy of the abstract which all
agencies of the Intelligence Community are being required to
use in abstracting information that agency has provided one
of the Select Committees. These abstracts will be retained
in an interagency registry to be available for review by any
members of the Intelligence Community as well as the White
House. The purpose of this interagency registry is to have
available in one location all information in abstract form
that members of the Intelligence Community have provided the
SSC.

Attached is a memorandum for Mr. John Clarke, Chairman
of the Group, advising the names and titles of individuals on
Congressman Nedzi's staff or on the staff of the House Armed
Services Committee who have been approved for access to classi-
fied material. It is assumed that these persons will have
continuing close relations with Congressman Nedzi and may be
officially associated with the House Select Committee.

Also attached is a letter from Senator Church, Chairman
of the Select Committee, addressed to the President enclosing a
list of documents which the SSC is requesting from the White House.

ACTION:

For information and record purposes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

# The Third Agency Rule

1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked. Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense information originating in another Department or agency" to an agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the consent of the originating Department or agency". The only exception to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Community. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is a homogenous product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order 11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the following controls: Sec.. 9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information and material, including those which presently relate to communications intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order 11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassification and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:

A.(2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to a security clearance, a person must have a need for access to the particular classified information or material sought in connection with the performance of his official duties or


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

Atractual obligations. The determation of that need shall be made by officials having responsibility for the classified information or material.

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any other Department to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information. Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING NOTICE -- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any manner outside authorized channels without the permission of the originating Department and an assessment by the senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department as to the potential risk to the national security and to the intelligence sources and methods involved.

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The establishment of special rules limiting access to, distribution and protection of classified information and material under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior approval of the head of a Department or his designee,

5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are received from all members of the Intelligence Community and then disseminated to members of the community under the authority of the DCI;

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State Department may not be sent by the State Department to the Department of Commerce without the permission of the CIA;

(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus, a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA information should be referred to CIA for action so that the necessary protection of the information can be insured.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

(d) If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinction here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate intelligence.

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Ad Hoc Group

SUBJECT: Handling of Third Agency Matters in Response to Congressional Select Committees

1. As you are aware, Senator Church already has submitted to me a long list of materials which he requests be provided to his Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities. He has submitted other lists to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the White House. It is expected that other elements of the Intelligence Community will be hearing from Senator Church.

2. The scope of the investigation necessarily is going to involve Third Agency relationships to a considerable degree.

3. In the implementation of Executive Order 11652, "Classification and Declassification of National Security Information and Material," the President directed the following:

"D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S. C. 403, classified information or material originating in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any other Department to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating department."

4. As regards Section 102 of the 1947 Act, the following quotes 102 (e) in full:

"(3) To the extent recommended by the National Security Council and approved by the President, such intelligence of the departments and agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter provided, relating to the national security,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 172

shall be open to the inspection of the Director of Central
Intelligence, and such intelligence as relates to the
national security and is possessed by such departments and
other agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter
provided, shall be made available to the Director of
Central Intelligence for correlation, evaluation and
dissemination: Provided, however, that upon the written
request of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall make available
to the Director of Central Intelligence such information
for correlation, evaluation and dissemination as may be
essential to the national security."

5. If I am requested to provide certain materials and
   investigation indicates that the material asked for involves a document
   which originated within an organization other than the Intelligence
   Community Staff or the Central Intelligence Agency, the requestor
   will be asked to redirect his inquiry to the office of origin.

6. It already is apparent, however, that the documentation
   being requested inevitably is going to include references to inter-
   relationships among various of the elements of the intelligence
   community. Clearing each and every such reference with every
   agency mentioned could manifestly be extremely consuming of time
   and manpower.

7. I propose the Ad Hoc Group agree on the following procedure.
   Where it appears that truly sensitive matters are involved, the
   material will be sanitized by the agency concerned and a check will
   be made with the appropriate Third Agency organizations before
   release. Where the reference concerns a Third Agency indirectly
   or is not considered sensitive and does not pose policy concerns, the
   agency concerned may forward the material to the requesting Select
   Committee without an item-by-item, mention-by-mention clearance
   with Third Agencies. However, in all cases notification that such
   material has been forwarded will be made to the central index and

NW 88296 DocId:32989628 Page 172


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 173

all agencies alerted through that mechanism. Agencies will designate on their submissions to the central index, the name and telephone number of the releasing party.

8. Ad hoc members should be prepared to discuss and come to some agreement on this matter at the next meeting.

MEMORANDUM FOR: USİB Ad Hoc Group

SUBJECT: Sanitization Guidelines for Documents
Provided Congressional Select
Committees

1. Attached is a copy of a statement, "Guidelines for Sanitizing Certain Documents Provided Select Committees" prepared by the Chairman, USIB Security Committee, for consideration by the Ad Hoc Group. This step is a follow on to the understanding the DCI has with Senator Church that sanitization of selective documents will be undertaken before the documents are released to the Committee. Similar understandings have been discussed with House Staff as well.

2. It is important that, to the extent possible, all intelligence organizations follow generally the same sanitization guidelines. Accordingly, the USIB Ad Hoc Group should consider utilizing these or similar guidelines within their respective organizations.

3. If requested by the Chairman, the DCI will discuss orally with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate and House Select Committees the content of the sensitive USIB or CIA material excised from documents. Where appropriate, the DCI may discuss this sensitive material with the entire Select Committee. He considers it essential that the written record provided to the Committee staff not include such sensitive information for the protection of intelligence sources and methods.

DRAFT
28 MARCH '75

GUIDELINES FOR SANITIZING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS
PROVIDED SELECT COMMITTEES

1.  The Director of Central Intelligence has recently discussed with Senator Church the need for special consideration and treatment by the Select Committee of certain sensitive aspects of intelligence activities and the Senator has expressed his recognition of this need. Included in such matters are the identities of sensitive sources, the material provided to the United States by cooperating foreign intelligence services, the details of technical devices and systems and of operational methods, the identities of certain employees whose safety could be jeopardized if revealed, the identities of American citizens and organizations who have cooperated with US intelligence and some additional materials the public disclosure of which would create serious foreign policy or national security problems. Such material should be protected not only from exposure but indeed the risk of exposure. Further, recognition should be given to the need to protect certain other information which, if improperly disclosed, might impair the privacy rights of individuals.

NW-88296-Docld:32989628.Page 1.75


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

2. One form of this special consideration may include use
   of sanitization procedures to avoid the risk of exposing such matters
   and at the same time satisfy the Select Committee's need for a full
   understanding of the community's activities.

3. What May Be Sanitized

While it is not possible to anticipate all requirements which
may be levied by the Committees for documenting material and not
possible to determine specifically what material should be excised
from these documents, the following illustrations are offered in
certain likely categories. The criteria in all cases should meet
the test mentioned above.

4. Collection of Intelligence

(a) The Committee will probably address the matter of how
intelligence activities or methods have or may impinge upon individual
rights. Documents supporting responses may be sanitized by removal
of identities of sensitive agents and informants, covert personnel,
and contractual cover arrangements. A descriptive phrase may be
substituted, i.e., a foreign journalist, a political official in the
opposition party. No sanitization should be used in connection with

- 2 -

NW 88296 DocId:32989628 Page 176


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 177

names of individuals whose employment or former employment by, or association with a department or agency, does not remain secret or for individuals whose present or future activities on behalf of the department or agency do not require that previous cover arrangements remain secret.

(b) Some information may be required with respect to technical intelligence systems including cryptologic and communications activities and reconnaissance capabilities. Almost all of such material is currently handled in compartmentation control channels under various codewords or nicknames. No security threat is perceived by release of these codenames or nicknames in documents. Details of the technical systems involved, contractual arrangements, funding and/or names of companies or consultants whose participation was obtained under agreement of continued secrecy may be excised from documents. Any question on release of codeword material should be referred to the Program Manager who in turn may consult with the Director of Central Intelligence to ensure a consistent approach in the community's sanitization procedure. While documentary samples of intelligence obtained by technical means may be used in support of verbal testimony, no raw product should be provided the Committees

- 3 -

NW 88296 DocId:32989628 Page 177


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 178

for retention. If absolutely required by the Committees, sanitization
of such raw product should be conducted to mask the degree of
technical capabilities.

5. Intelligence Estimates

Finished intelligence reports of departments and agencies and
estimates do not usually contain source identifications and will not
normally require sanitization. However, departments and agencies
should review such publications to ensure deletion of source identities.

6. Administration

Information concerning the internal administration arrangements
of intelligence agencies may be requested. This may include staffing
chart with occupants identified. Sanitization of individual, Identities
of personnel formerly not under cover and now functioning-in a cover
assignment should be deleted as well as those who may in the future
be considered for a covert assignment..

7. General

The following categories of information or specific examples
may arise in any number of circumstances in documentation requested
by the Select Committees. In all cases, serious consideration should
be given by the department or agency concerned to the necessity of

- 4 -

NW 88296, DocId:32989628. Page 178:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 179

deletion or sanitization of this type of information, prior to
providing the document.

(a) Agent or informant names or operational information
revealing them.

(b) Details which would reveal the effectiveness of sensitive
methods and techniques (1) employed overseas-in-human-source-
collection, (2) employed for the physical security protection of the
department's or agency's personnel or physical environment.

(c) The numbers, locations, times and other indications of
recruitment or emplacement of personnel within targetted foreign
organizations.

(d) The success or failure of recruitment attempts in any
given targetted foreign organization.

(e) Names of particular employees whose physical safety or
future career might be placed in jeopardy by exposure.

(f) Foreign or US sources, official or otherwise who agreed
to cooperate under terms of explicit or implied confidentiality, who
would be embarrassed or endangered by disclosure of their role.

(g) Identifying information on intelligence services in friendly
and neutral countries.

- 5 -

NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 179


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 180

(h) Identifying collaborative operations between the United States intelligence agencies and other foreign intelligence liaison services against targets within the country extending the collaborations or within a jointly targetted third country.

(i) Identifying collaboration with foreign governments in signals intelligence collection, particularly for arrangements which, if revealed, would be politically embarrassing in the countries involved.

(j) Identification of technical intelligence operations of high technical vulnerability and extremely high political sensitivity.

(k) Specific identification of foreign technical collection installations involving high political sensitivity in the host country.

(l) Details or disclosure of monetary arrangements with US and foreign banks, investment houses, etc., in support of foreign intelligence operations.

(m) Specific information on special relationships with private firms established with the approval of top corporate officials. This includes names of firms or industrial associations that collaborate in a special manner such as providing cover for foreign intelligence operations.

- 6 -
  NW 88296.Docld:32989628 Page 180


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 181

(n) Names of firms collaborating with US intelligence
agencies in collection and assessment programs (especially
those having large foreign clienteles).

(o) Proprietary information relating to contractors
or furnished in confidence..

## 8. What Should Not Be Sanitized

There are general categories of intelligence activities which
have already been placed in the public domain by the mass news media
or authors with background experience in intelligence departments
or agencies of the community. Names, places, dates and events
which have been so revealed should not be excised if contained in
requested documents.

There is an increasing body of information which has been
released under the Freedom of Information Act. No further sanitization
of this material should be conducted unless it relates to an individual's
rights to privacy.

## 9. Techniques of Sanitization

Sanitization of intelligence material is usually considered the
act of physical removal of the identity of a person, place or thing
from written communication with or without regard for the residual

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 182

content. Use of a substitution device, either pseudonym or ident
is an example of sanitization which permits intelligent continuity
of the material without revealing the true identity. Sanitization
does not extend to the use of false or misleading substitute material
in this context.

The integrity of official records must be maintained. The
following sanitization techniques apply only to copies of records.

(a) Physical Sanitization - Names may be cut out and
the residual material xeroxed and submitted to Committees. Names
may be masked with correction tape and then xeroxed. The xerox
copy may be submitted to the Committees.

(b) Names may be deleted and replaced with "IDEN."
The delted material is provided on a separate IDEN list which
contains names or descriptive phrases substituted for deletions.

(c) The material can be retyped or reprinted with
substitute phrases or substitute descriptions which do not reveal
the sensitive material.

(d) Entire pages can be removed from some documents
and replaced with a blank page carrying only reference information

- 8 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 183

as to the location of the sensitive material within the contributing
department or agency. This technique may be employed when
physical sanitization or excision of material results in unintelligible
gibberish as residue.

(e) Within a category of inquiry, it may be desirable to
extract a complete document from requested material when the
request is broad and all inclusive within its field. The existence
of such a document should be made known to the Committees but
retained by the agency or department for review under escort
of a representative of the department or agency.

10. Management of Sanitization

The original record and a copy of the sanitized version provided
should be readily available in all cases. Materials developed within an
agency or department in response to requests should be reviewed at an
appropriate level for completeness, responsiveness and accuracy. In
the case of documents or materials of a community nature, the release

should be done in coordination with the departments or agencies and/or

the Program Manager concerned and any sanitization should be agreed
upon during coordination.

- 9 -

NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 183


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

This proposed use of sanitization as a special arrangement. to protect selected issues contained in material provided to Select Committees by one agency may prove to be a futile exercise if not practiced in common by all participating departments and agencies. It is essential to the proposal that departments and agencies attempt to employ the same criteria for sanitization and coordinate as required. This paper can serve only as general guidelines on sanitization.

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. President:

On behalf of the Senate Select Comittee To Study Governmental
Operations With Respect To Intelligence Activities, Senator Tower and
I want to thank you for the opportunity we had on March 5 to discuss
the work of the Committee. I went to express my personal appreciation
for the direct and forthright manner in which you addressed some cî
the initial questions that lay before the Select Committee, and your
willingness to assist the Committee to meet its responsibilities under
the randate of S. Rec. 21.

We are in agreement that the work of the Committee should proceed
as expeditiously as possible and the Comittee is gratified at the full
and complete cooperation that we have received from the Executive
agencies up to this point. In every respect thus far, the agencies
have been fully cooperative with the Committee and the staff and I
believe this augers well for a constructive and expeditious conclusion
to our inquiry.

At our meeting on March 5th with you, we discussed the general
areas in which the Committee would need initial documentation. As we
discussed, our first requirements are to determine the legal basis
for the activities for the intelligence agencies of the United States
Government. In this regard, it will be helpful to the Committee to
receive from whomever you may designate, the documents, files, and
other papers that might be required to fully determine the legpl basis
for the activities of United States intelligence agencies. With the
unanimous approval of the Committee, I respectfully request that the
documente on the attached list directly relevant to the inquiry
authorized by S. Res. 21, be supplied to the Committee at the earliest
opportunity.

With kind regards,

Sincerely,

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM : Legal Counse

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

DATE: 4-3-75

By memorandum dated 3-20-75, you were advised of a request received from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. The Intelligence Division requested that an attempt be made to modify portions of the Committee's request.

Regarding Part I titled Legal Authorities, the Intelligence Division pointed out that this particular request was wide-ranging and required a considerable file review as it requested any memorandum discussing the legal authority of the FBI to "(1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence information, and (3) engage in counter-intelligence activities; together with copies of all constitutional and statutory provisions, executive orders, presidential directives, Attorney General opinions and memoranda, and any other materials asserted as sources of such authority." With regard to Part III concerning the FBI's administrative organization, they requested the identities by name of personnel in the Intelligence Division, Unit Chief and above. This caused concern in the Intelligence Division that there would be a needless proliferation of a list of Bureau personnel working in this field which list, of course, would be of interest to foreign intelligence sources.

On 4-1-75 Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly discussed these matters with William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee; John T. Elliff, who has been nominated to head the task force for the Committee looking into FBI activities; F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select Committee; and staff member Michael Epstein. They agreed to modify the request in Part III to the extent that personnel in the Intelligence Division need not be identified by name below the level of Assistant Director in the organization chart to be furnished them pursuant to their request of 3-19-75. They asked as an alternative the Bureau prepare a list of personnel in the Intelligence Division down to the level of Unit Chief with names included which they would have access to review in Bureau space.

# Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75

With regard to Part I relating to legal authorities, they stated they were amenable to the Bureau furnishing them whatever documents they have retrieved up to this time which have been recovered pursuant to their request of 3-19-75 and that no additional detailed review need be conducted until they review the aforementioned documents. At the end of their review they will make any additional specific requests concerning this part of their request. They also asked that in our response we furnish them copies of documents listed on a three-page paper prepared by the staff of the Senate Select Committee, a copy of which is attached.

Staff Director Miller requested that the Bureau expedite their response to the Senate Select Committee's request as the first meeting of that Committee is scheduled for Wednesday, 4-9-75, and he felt strongly that they must have material that showed progress in their study of the FBI prior to that time. Mr. Miller requested that, if necessary, the request be responded to in a piecemeal basis and that the complete response does not necessarily have to be made at one time.

It is suggested that we make available to this Committee as soon as possible those documents which we have furnished the General Accounting Office (GAO) which also fall within the 3-19-75 request of the Senate Select Committee. In this regard staff members have advised they are in contact with GAO auditors concerning the FBI.

By way of observations it is obvious that the staff members of the Committee are well versed in Bureau policy and procedures. To this point they have been cooperative and we should insure that we give a timely response to their various requests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Intelligence Division advise whether modification of the Senate Select Committee's request concerning legal authorities for investigations and the modification of the table of organization of the Intelligence Division are acceptable and, if so, expeditiously prepare the necessary response to the Senate Select Committee.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that all
responses for the production of records, etc., received from Congressional
committees be forwarded by letterhead memorandum through the Deputy
Attorney General to the requesting committee, and also that in selected instances
a property stamp or statement be affixed to certain documents limiting access

With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into
FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding of
documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as requests
such as the request of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
have been forwarded to this Bureau through the Department, it would appear
logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional
committees, whether they be directed to the Department and/or the Bureau,
be responded to through the Department. Such a procedure not only will make
all our responses consistent but will also give the Department an opportunity to
review and approve documents being made available to Congress.

In connection with our preparation of responses to requests di
Congressional committees, it is suggested that all responses should be by
letterhead memorandum, the first paragraph of which should clearly describe
the specific request which is being responded to in the letterhead memorandum.

In those instances where documents are of a nature that we ares
not desirous of unauthorized personnel, whether they be in Congress or otherwise,
having access to, we should affix a property stamp. This property stamp should
read as follows:

"This document is prepared in response to your request and
is not for dissemination outside of your Committee. Its use
is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the
contents may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel without
the express approval of the FBI. "

February 23, 1949

Subject: Delimitation of Investigative Duties of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Intelligence Division of the Army, and the office of Special Investigations, Inspector General, U. S. Air Force.

The Agreement for Coordination of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of Naval Intelligence, Intelligence Division of the Army, and the Office of Special Investigations, Inspector General, U. S. Air Force.

I. The undersigned have reviewed the directive contained in the President's Memorandum of June 26, 1939, as augmented by his Directive of September 6, 1939, the Delimitations Agreement of February 9, 1942, and the Presidential Directive of October 30, 1947. In addition. cognizance has been taken of the provisions or the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, and the specific application of that Act is set forth in Section II hereof. All other provisions of this Agreement are apart from and have no relation to the stated requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. In view of the above, it is now agreed that responsibility for the investigation of all activities coming under the categories of espionage, counterespionage, subversion and sabotage (hereinafter referred to as "these categories") will be delimited as indicated hereinafter. The responsibility assumed by one organization in a given field carries with it the obligation to exchange freely and directly with the other subscribing organizations all information of mutual interest. When the organization with primary operating responsibility is unable for any reason to produce material in that field desired by the subscribing agencies, such special arrangements as may be legal or desirable will be worked out through negotiation at the national level prior to activity by one agency in another agency's field. It is recognized by the subscribers hereto that the Headquarters Department of the Army has decentralized such functions to its major subordinate commanders. When the major subordinate commanders of the Department of the Army cannot effect satisfactory special arrangements, the matter will be referred to the Director of Intelligence of the Army for further negotiations at the national level. Close cooperation and coordination between the four subscribing organizations is a mutually recognized necessity.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 203

## II. FBI will be responsible for:

1.  All investigations of cases in these categories involving civilians and foreign nationals of all classes in the continental United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the State of Hawaii**,** and the State of Alaska* except as specifically described hereinafter in Paragraph V, Section 5.

2.  All investigations of violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. There are no territorial or personnel limitations on this provision.

3.  The coordination of the investigative activities of civilian agencies in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the State of Alaska except as specifically described hereinafter in Paragraph V, Section 5, which provide information regarding subversive movements and activities in these categories.

4.  Keeping the other subscribing organizations advised of important developments in these categories within its cognizance, particularly:

    a. Activities of inactive reserves of the armed service, including the National Guard.

    b. Developments affecting plants engaged in armed forces contracts.

    c. Developments concerning the strength, composition, and intentions of civilian groups within its cognizance which are classed as subversive and whose activities are a potential danger to the security of the United States.

    d. Developments affecting those vital facilities and vital utilities which have been designated by the Secretary of Defense.

    e. Developments affecting critical points of trans- portation and communications systems which have been designated by the Secretary of Defense.

(For b, d, and e above no protective coverage is contemplated.)

## APPENDIX A

## PERIOD OF MARTIAL LAW

I. It is further agreed that when a state of martial law has been declared by the President, the armed forces commander will assume responsibilities for coverage in these categories. His authority to direct and control the subscribing agencies of the armed forces will be limited only by such instructions as he may receive from the Secretary of Defense. He will have authority to coordinate the intelligence activities of the subscribing agencies in his area of responsibility, within the limits of their available personnel and facilities, by the assignment of missions, the designation of objectives, and the exercise of such coordinating control as he deems necessary. He is not authorized to control the administration or discipline of the subscribing agencies in the area of his responsibility, nor to issue instructions to them beyond those necessary for the purposes stated above.

II. Personnel of the subscribing agencies in the area of responsibility of the armed forces commander will still send reports to and be under the continued supervision of their respective headquarters. They will render such aid and assistance to the armed forces commander and his designated representatives as are possible and practicable. They will furnish all pertinent information, data, and other material that are or may be necessary or desirable to the armed forces commander by the most expeditious means and methods possible consistent with requisite security. Each headquarters of the subscribing agencies will promptly be advised by its agencies of all information and data appropriately identified as having been furnished to the armed forces commander.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

# APPENDIX B

## PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT MILITARY INTERESTS, NOT INVOLVING MARTIAL LAW

I. In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as potential theaters of operation." When an armed forces commander of such a potential theater is designated, he definitely has interest in, though not control of, the civilian life within the area. In order that the armed forces commander, may prepare him- self for the discharge of the possible responsibility which may affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:

1. Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army; and the OSI, IG, U.S. Air Force will continue to function in accordance with the provisions of Sections II, III, IV, and V.

2. In addition thereto, the armed forces commander may take steps to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the manner in which complete coverage will be obtained if martial law is declared. Adequate liaison with the other subscribing agencies will insure that the armed forces commander will have the benefit of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the representatives of the other agencies.

3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and receive such information from the other three agencies as he may desire and they may be able to furnish.

II. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the coverage furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake. When the commander feels that more complete coverage is required, it is recognized that he is authorized to augment the coverage with such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his jurisdiction. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally coming under the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies, the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority from the Secretary of Defense.

III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces commander, whenever any of the other services feel that such a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken, it should be so recommended.

# Supplemental Agreement No. I
to the Delimitations. Agreement

## Cooperation and Coordination Between
### The Federal Bureau of Investigation
### The Intelligence Division of the Army
### The Office of Naval Intelligence and
### The Office of Special Investigations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force

The Director of Intelligence, U.S. Army, the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Director of Naval
Intelligence and the Director of the Office of Special Investi-
gations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force, with a view to
promoting the closest possible cooperation and coordination
between the Field Services of these agencies agree that the
following recommendations will be transmitted to their field
installations:

(a) Special Agents in Charge of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Divisional Offices, Military Intelligence Officers
of the pertinent Armies, District Officers of the Office of
Special Investigations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force, and
Naval District Intelligence Officers will maintain close personal
liaison between those offices and their representatives, including
a meeting of representatives of the four agencies, preferably the
officers in charge, at least twice per month, for the purpose of
discussing pending and contemplated investigative activities, and
any other subject necessary to insure that there is proper co-
ordination of their investigative work.

(b) The close personal liaison to be maintained
between representatives of the four agencies at all times should
insure that there is not duplication of effort in any field, and
that a proper coverage of the whole investigative field is main-
tained. Particular attention should be paid to avoiding any
duplication in connection with the use of informers.

(c) A distinction should be recognized between the
investigative interest of individual agencies and the coverage
interest. It is believed that all four agencies should study,
from time to time, the coverage of the investigative field in
order to insure that all channels of interest and avenues of
information are adequately covered by at least one of the partici-
pating agencies.

(d) Where there is doubt as to whether or not one of the
other agencies is interested in information collected, it should

(e) Consideration should be given to the fact that certain classes of information are of general interest to the Military, Naval, and Air Force Intelligence Services in connection with background and knowledge of espionage and sabotage organizations, even though the Military, Naval, and Air Force Intelligence Services may have no apparent direct investigative interest.

(f) Should differences of opinion of a minor nature occur, the directors of the four intelligence agencies feel that with proper personal. liaison, such differences can be satisfactorily adjusted locally by the officials in charge of the various divisional organizations.

to the Delimitations Agreement
(As Amended June 8, 1950)

## Investigative Jurisdiction on
Vessels of Military Sea Transportation Service

1.  The investigative jurisdiction of all activities under the categories of espionage, counterespionage, subversion and sabotage on vessels of the Military Sea Transportation Service is as follows:

a. Investigative jurisdiction on vessels purchased by the Navy will be the responsibility of the Office of Naval Intelligence.

b. Vessels obtained by the Navy through a "bare boat charter" will be under the investigative jurisdiction of the Office of Naval Intelligence.

c. Vessels allocated to the Military Sea Transportation Service which are manned and superviced by their private owners are under the investigative jurisdiction of the FBI.

2.  When civilian personnel who are subjects of an investigation under a or b above reach a U.S. port or a port where the FBI has a Field agency, or prior to reaching such port, if practicable, the Department of the Navy will promptly furnish the FBI all pertinent information concerning the investigation. If personnel who are subjects of an investigation as above remove themselves from the vessel upon arrival of the vessel in port and further surveillance is considered necessary, the Navy will continue surveillance until notified by the FBI at local level that the FBI will make every effort to transfer responsibility upon arrival of the vessel at the port.

3.  When the FBI opens an investigation under c above or when an FBI investigation in progress develops or is believed about to develop ramifications under a, b or c above, the FBI will promptly furnish all pertinent information to the Navy and will thereafter coordinate its actions with the Navy whenever and wherever deemed necessary to insure proper pursuit of the case.

# Supplemental Agreement No. IV
to the Delimitations Agreement

## Investigation of Private Contractors of the Armed Forces

It is agreed by the subscribers of the Delimitations Agreement (hereinafter referred to as subscribers) that with reference investigations of civilian employees, applicants for employment, directors and key personnel of privately owned plants and facilities, working or bidding on contracts important to the Army, Navy or Air Force (hereinafter referred to as the Armed Forces) procurement, the following will be followed insofar as practicable. Exceptions thereto will be adjusted by mutual agreement between the subscribers concerned.

a. The Armed Forces will conduct background investigations of such persons unless there is a particular reason for requesting that an investigation be conducted by the FBI or the FBI has a special interest in a particular case and has notified the Armed Forces of such interest.

b. The FBI will conduct complaint investigations of such personnel upon specific request in each case by one or more of the Armed Forces. If one of the Armed Forces has no further need for an investigation requested, but not completed, prompt notification will be made to the FBI.

c. Investigations conducted by the Armed Forces under a above will be terminated and all information passed to the FBI when credible derogatory information of a loyalty nature is uncovered. Upon receipt of such a case, the FBI will proceed as under b above if one of the Armed Forces so requests.

d. When one of the subscribers is aware that another is conducting an investigation on a person or firm identical or closely connected with a person or firm it contemplates investigating, no investigation will be undertaken without the consent of the subscriber which has an investigation in progress. The investigating agency will make available to the other interested agency copies of the reports of the investigation made.

e. Normally, identity of confidential informants will not be communicated from one subscriber to another; however, when such communication occurs, the receiving subscriber will employ the highest possible safeguards to insure that such informants are not compromised. No transmittal of information concerning confidential informants to a third subscriber or to another agency is authorized except by specific consent of the originator.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 214

f. A subscriber who receives a report of investigation from another subscriber may freely transmit copies of such reports to a third subscriber except as provided in e above.

g. A report of complete investigation received by the Armed Forces from the FBI will not be reopened without the approval of the FBI except to obtain additional background information. In such case, the FBI will be furnished copies of all information obtained. Other information required by the Armed Forces will be requested of the FBI.

h. If one of the Armed Forces requests the FBI to conduct an investigation or to conduct additional ditional investigation as provided under g above, and if for any reason the FBI declines or is unable to conduct such investigation or additional investigation, the Armed Force concerned may proceed with the investigation. The FBI will be furnished copies of the results thereof if the FBI so requests or if the Armed Force concerned considers the results to be of FBI interest.

i. Nothing above is to be construed as altering the basic Delimitations Agreement of 1949 or current agreements concerning subversive organizations.

# Supplemental Agreement No. V
to the Delimitations Agreement

## Investigation of Reserve and Civilian Components of the Armed Services

It is agreed by the subscribers to the Delimitations Agreement that the Army, the Navy and the Air Force may conduct background investigations on members of the inactive reserve and National Guard who are anticipated being called back to active duty, or where an investigation is undertaken for the purpose of determining whether the individual should be disenrolled from his military status, or to determine whether the individual may be granted access to classified military information. The following procedures shall be pursued in each of the above circumstances:

(1) The Intelligence agencies of the Army, Navy or Air Force before undertaking such background investigation will consult the FBI to determine: (a) if the FBI has an investigation in progress; if so, no investigation will be undertaken by the intelligence agencies except as may be mutually agreeable to the Armed Force concerned and the FBI; (b) if the FBI already has made an investigation; if so, the results will be made available to the other agencies; (c) if the FBI has information on the individual, even though it may not have conducted an investigation.

(2) If, after consulting the FBI, investigation is undertaken by the other agencies, it will be pursued no further than is necessary to make the determination required by the other agencies, and all information developed pertinent to the four categories will be furnished promptly to the FBI.

(1) CIA will not initiate an investigation of any
foreign official in the United States without the concurrence
and coordination of the FBI. In this context, the term
"investigation" means systematic and direct inquiries or
procedures (such as physical or technical surveillances
or neighborhood inquiries) aiming at developing information
concerning an individual's activities or background;
"investigation" does not include the acceptance or the
development of information through social. contacts or contacts
normally made by CIA agents in discharging their cover
functions.(5)

(2) CIA will seek concurrence and coordination of
the FBI before approaching for recruitment any foreign
official or communist-bloc visitor in the United States.
The FBI will concur and coordinate if the proposed action
does not conflict with any operation, current or planned,
including active investigation of the FBI. (5).

(3) CIA will advise the FBI prior to any planned
meeting between a CIA asset and a foreign official or
communist-bloc visitor of known or presumed interest to
the FBI (this would include all communist-bloc officials
and visitors) for purposes of assessment and social
development.(5).

(4) Clandestine CIA staff operatives, domestic
American agents of CIA, and foreign agents of CIA recruited
abroad who come to the United States will be identified to
the FBI by name or appropriate description depending on
the national security interest involved. (5)

assignment, the Bureau will be advised and the two agencies will confer regarding the handling of the agent in the United States. It is recognized that each case will have its individual peculiarities. The governing principle will be positive intelligence interest as weighed against internal security factors. CIA will continue its contractual relationship for the purpose of handling the training, the procurement of positive foreign intelligence, the fulfillment of CIA commitments to the agent, and the preparation of the agent for his next assignment abroad. [^5]

(6) In those cases where CIA will be handling its agent in the United States, CIA will service FBI security or counterintelligence requirements and will provide the FBI all agent information bearing on counterintelligence or internal security matters, including the scope and nature of the agent's access to information and the identities of the agent's significant contacts, particularly in the communist-bloc field. In such cases where CIA servicing has been inadequate to FBI internal security interests, the FBI will have direct access to the agent. [^5]

# INVESTIGATIVE GUIDELINES
TITLE XI, ORGANIZED CRIME CONTROL ACT OF 1970
REGULATION OF EXPLOSIVES

## 1. General

Title XI of the captioned law amends Title 18, United States Code, by adding a new chapter 40 with section numbers 841 through 848 governing the importation, manufacture, distribution and storage of explosive materials and creating certain Federal offenses pertaining to the unlawful use of explosives. Administration of explosives regulation is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury as is investigative jurisdiction over the unlawful acts proscribed in section 842. Under authority contained in section 846 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) have concurrent investigative jurisdiction as to the remainder of chapter 40, i.e., the unlawful acts proscribed in subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of section 844. Although not specified in chapter 40, the Postal Inspection Service shall have jurisdiction to investigate all incidents involving explosive or incendiary devices sent through the mails or directed against U.S. Postal Service property.

Title XI greatly broadens Federal authority pertaining to explosives-connected offenses. At the same time, Congress has expressly disclaimed any intent to occupy the field to the exclusion of state law on the same subject matter. To effect both Congressional purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carefully allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATF and the FBI have jurisdiction.

## 2. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Jurisdiction in General

(a) Effect on prior jurisdiction - This agreement applies only to those incidents as to which the FBI had no investigative jurisdiction prior to the enactment of the captioned law and to incidents previously subject to FBI investigation by reason of chapter 65, Title 18, United States Code (malicious mischief). Investigative procedures in other types of incidents (e.g., train wrecking, damaging aircraft and motor vehicles, racketeering) shall remain unchanged.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 220

- 2 -

(b) Primary jurisdiction - Subject to the provisions hereof, the FBI will exercise primary jurisdiction over all alleged violations of section 844 which are directed at foreign diplomatic facilities or at activities, such as transportation and tourist offices, operating under the aegis of a foreign government although not in a diplomatic status, over all alleged violations of subsections 844(d) through (i) which are perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary groups or individuals and all other violations of subsections 844(e) through (g) which are not directed at Treasury Department or Postal Service buildings or functions.

(c) Type of Investigation to be Conducted

(1) Offenses perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary groups or individuals The FBI will immediately initiate a full investigation of all alleged violations of section 844 which appear at the outset to have been perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary groups or individuals as defined in advance by the Intermal Security Division of the Department of Justice. If ATF or the Postal Inspection Service has properly initiated investigations and information is subsequently developed indicating apparent involvement of terrorist/revolutionary groups or individuals, responsibility shall be relinquished to the FBI unless a determination is made by the Department of Justice that a transfer of responsibilities will unduly impair further investigative efforts.

(2) Alleged offenses against Colleges and Universities The FBI will immediately initiate a full investigation of any alleged violation of section 844 which involves the use or attempted use of explosive (as distinguished from incendiary) materials against the facilities of a college or university. Investigation of alleged violations involving use or attempted use of incendiary materials will be limited initially to the development of background information as prescribed in paragraph 6 below.

(3) Alleged offenses directed against foreign diplomatic facilities and related activities The FBI will immediately initiate a full investigation of all alleged violations of section 844 which are directed at foreign diplomatic facilities and related activities as described in paragraph 2(b) above.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 221

- 3 -

(4) All other alleged violations of subsection 844(f) -- offenses involving use of explosives against United States property or federally financed organizations, and (g) offenses involving possession of explosives in buildings owned, leased, used, etc., by the United States - The FBI will immediately initiate a full investigation of all violations of subsection 844(g) over which it has primary jurisdiction hereunder, and those violations of 844(f) which are directed at federal property (e.g., a military facility) or a federal function (e.g., a Selective Service or ROTC facility). In other violations of 844(f) the FBI will develop and disseminate background information as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

3. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division (ATF) Jurisdiction in General

(a) Violations ancillary to firearms laws violations or violation of section 842 - The Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division (ATF) of the Department of the Treasury will exercise investigative jurisdiction over violations of section 844 which are ancillary to its primary jurisdiction over the Federal firearms laws or over section 842 of Title XI.

(b) Violations of subsection 844(d) - interstate transportation of explosives with unlawful intent and subsection 844(i) - offenses against property used in or affecting commerce - Subject to paragraph 2b, above, the ATF will exercise primary investigative jurisdiction over violations of subsection 844(d) and (i) and will conduct a full investigation thereof unless notified by the Criminal Division that pursuant to paragraph 2(c)(1), above, the Department of Justice has requested FBI investigation in a particular matter.

(c) Violations directed at Treasury Department property or functions - The ATF shall have primary jurisdiction to investigate all violations of section 844 which are directed at Treasury Department property or functions and will conduct a full investigation of such violations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 222

# 4. Postal Inspection Service Jurisdiction

The Postal Inspection Service shall have primary jurisdiction to investigate all violations of section 844 which are directed at U.S. Postal Service property or functions.

# 5. Special Considerations

(a) Bomb Threats, false information (section 844(e)) -
The ATF and the Postal Inspection Service shall have jurisdiction over violations of section 844(e) against Treasury Department or Postal Service property or functions, respectively. The FBI shall have jurisdiction over all other violations of section 844(e). Upon receipt of information alleging or suggesting a violation of subsection 844(e), the investigative agency concerned will review available information to determine whether the identity of the offender is known or can be readily ascertained and, if not, whether the evidence suggests a pattern or plan of such offenses by a particular offender or against a particular victim. If such a pattern appears or if the offender is identified, all available information will be disseminated as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

(b) Use/carrying explosive in commission of a felony (section 844(h)) - Violations of 844(h) should be handled as an adjunct of the felony from which they arise and should be discussed with the appropriate United States Attorney or Division of the Department handling prosecution of the underlying felony offense. The agency having jurisdiction over the underlying felony will have investigative jurisdiction over the 844(h) violation (e.g., bank robbery is under FBI jurisdiction).

(c) Violations of 26 U.S.C. 5861 (destructive devices) -
In incidents involving alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. 844 (which may also involve a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5861), ATF shall not exercise its primary jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. 5861 involving destructive devices, but the incident shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of these guidelines. This is in no way a relinquishment by ATF of its investigative jurisdiction under Title II of the Gun Control Act of 1968.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 223

- 5 -

## 6. Development of Background Information

Some incidents such as those directed against Federal property or functions (paragraph 2(b) above) require immediate full federal investigation. Others require a more circumspect approach and will result in full Federal investigation only after consideration of factors pertinent to the exercise of Federal jurisdiction. Accordingly, in those incidents which these guidelines do not prescribe immediate full investigation, the investigative agency having jurisdiction will develop background information which includes (a) facts bearing on motivation such as involvement of the suspected perpetrators in terrorist/revolutionary activities, organized crime, labor-management disputes, or racial-religious hate activities; (b) the applicability of state and local laws and likelihood of state or local investigative and prosecutive actions; and (c) any other available facts indicating whether or not the offense warrants Federal investigation and prosecution. Such background information will be submitted telephonically (202-739-2745) or by teletype (710-822-0008) to the General Crimes Section of the Criminal Division and to the appropriate United States Attorney. The Criminal Division will advise the investigative agency concerned whether the matter warrants submission to any other Division or Section of the Criminal Division, and when so warranted the Criminal Division will transmit the information to such other Division or Section.

## 7. Full Investigation

A full investigation will be initiated immediately in those instances wherein such investigation is specified herein. In other instances full investigation will be initiated only upon direction of the Department of Justice after consideration by the Division having cognizance over the matter of the background information developed under paragraph 6 above.

## 8. Reports

Copies of case reports prepared in matters investigated under these guidelines will be furnished directly to the Department of Justice and the appropriate United States Attorney. All investigative agencies


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 224

- 6 -

shall submit initial reports as soon as practicable to the Department of Justice and shall submit progress reports once each 30 days or as soon thereafter as possible. The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice will be informed as soon as possible in each instance wherein an investigative agency initiates an investigation under section 844. Such notification is of critical importance to the avoidance of duplication of investigative activities. Also each agency subscribing to these guidelines shall, upon instituting inves- tigation regarding possible violations of section 844, immediately notify other subscribing agencies having a logical interest therein. Also, a sufficient level of follow-up liaison and dissemination shall be maintained to avoid duplication of investigative effort.

Additionally, each such agency will exchange information on a timely basis and in a manner which will not interfere with ongoing investigations relative to types, sources, movement, and storage of explosives which are the subject of its investigations. Information regarding significant developments in investigations being conducted under these guidelines and information of an intelli- gence nature developed incidental to investigations which is of logical interest to the Department of Justice shall be furnished promptly to the Criminal Division of that Department which will be responsible for any necessary further dissemination within that Department.

9. Review of Guidelines

These guidelines shall be reviewed on a continuing basis by the parties hereto to determine whether problems exist in their admin- istration which should be alleviated or whether modification of any of the terms of the agreement are needed in the interests of better law enforcement.

# AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

"AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

["I. Purpose of Agreement

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) originates, and receives from other sources, large numbers of reports on individuals and organizations. One purpose of this agreement is to define that portion of the information on file with, or received or originated by, the FBI, which the United States Secret Service (USSS) desires to receive in connection with its protective responsibilities.

"The USSS has statutory authority to protect, or to engage in certain activities to protect, the President and certain other persons. (Certain other persons, as used in this agreement, refers to those persons protected by the Secret Service under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056.) The authority of the USSS to protect the President or certain other persons is construed to authorize it to investigate organizations or individuals and to interview individuals who might constitute a threat to the President or certain other persons. The FBI has statutory authority to investigate assault, killing or kidnaping and attempts or conspiracies to kill or kidnap the President and other designated individuals.

"The FBI will make available to the USSS information it may request of information which by its nature reveals a definite or possible threat to the safety of the President and certain other persons.

"A second purpose of this agreement is to insure the most effective protection for the President and certain other persons by establishing a clear division of responsibility between the FBI and the USSS. Such division will also avoid compromising investigations or sources and needless duplication of effort.

"II. General Responsibilities

"The USSS is charged by Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056, with the responsibility of protecting the person of the President of the United States, the members of his immediate family, the President-elect, the Vice President or other officer in the order of succession to the office of President, and the Vice President-elect; protecting the person of a former President and his wife during his lifetime and the person of a widow of a former President until her death or remarriage, and minor children of a former President until they reach 16 years of age, unless such protection is declined; protecting persons who are determined from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Advisory Committee, as being major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who should receive such protection (unless the candidate has declined such protection); protecting the person of a visiting head of a foreign state or foreign government and, at the direction of the President, other distinguished foreign visitors to the United States and official representatives of the United States / performing special missions abroad (unless such persons decline protection).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 228

"The Executive Protective Service, under the control of the Director, USSS, is charged by Title 3, U. S. Code, Section 202, with protection of the Executive Mansion and grounds in the District of Columbia; any building in which Presidential offices are located; foreign diplomatic missions located in the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia; and foreign diplomatic missions located in such other areas in the United States, its territories and possessions, as the President, on a case-by-case basis, may direct.

"The FBI is charged under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751, with investigative jurisdiction over the assault, killing or kidnaping, and attempts or conspiracies to assault, kill or kidnap the President of the United States and other designated individuals.

"The FBI has responsibility for Federal investigations of all violations of Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 112, 970, 1116~1117 and 1201, relating to the 'Act for the Protection of Foreign Officials and Official Guests in the United States.'

"The FBI has investigative jurisdiction over violations of a wide range of the criminal statutes of the United States including primary jurisdiction over matters affecting the internal security of the United States.

"III. Exchange of Information and Coordination of Responsibilities

"The USSS undertakes to identify individuals or groups who because of their propensities or characteristics, may be dangerous to the President of the United States and certain other persons. To assist the USSS in identifying such individuals and groups the FBI agrees to furnish to the USSS, information (other than public source information or information originating with other U. S. agencies) from its files or which may come to its attention which by its nature reveals a danger or possible danger to the President or certain other persons, or which can be construed as falling within the categories of information desired by the USSS as set forth in Section IV of this agreement.

"The FBI will inform the USSS of the identity of individuals or organizations who come to the attention of the FBI as knowingly and willfully advocating, abetting, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the Government of the United States, or the Government of any state, territory, or possession, or political subdivision therein, by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of any such government. The FBI will furnish the USSS with reports on such individuals or organizations as requested. During investigation by the FBI of such individuals or organizations, the FBI will be alert and promptly notify the USSS of any information indicating a possible plot against the person of the President and certain other persons.

"The USSS agrees that it will conduct no investigation of individuals or groups identified or suspected of being threats to the internal security of the United States without notifying the FBI. However, when time for

NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 228


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 229

consultation is not available, and an indication of immediate danger
exists, the USSS may take such action as is necessary with respect to carry-
ing out its protective responsibilities. Any information obtained by the
USSS during such action will be furnished to the FBI as expeditiously as
possible.

"The FBI will not conduct investigation of individuals or groups solely
for the purpose of establishing whether they constitute a threat to the
safety of the President and certain other persons unless there is an indica-
tion of a violation of Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751, or other
statute over which the FBI has jurisdiction.

"It will be the responsibility of the FBI to advise the USSS when investiga-
tion is being initiated under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751 and there-
after to furnish the USSS with copies of the FBI investigative reports as
they are prepared. It will be the responsibility of the USSS to furnish
the FBI any information in its possession or which may come to its attention
which reasonably indicates that a violation of Title 18, U. S. Code,
Section 1751, has been or is being committed.

"The USSS also agrees to furnish the FBI any information in its possession
or which may come to its attention indicating a violation of any other
statutes over which the FBI has investigative jurisdiction.

"The FBI, under its responsibility for investigation of violations of
Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 112, 970, 1116-1117, 1201 and 1751 will take
cognizance of the protective responsibilities of the Treasury Department
under Title 3, U. S. Code, Section 202 and Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056
and thus does not limit or interfere with the authority of the Secretary of
the Treasury in the discharge of his statutory protective responsibilities.
This is not to be construed as vesting concurrent investigative jurisdiction
with the Treasury Department with respect to investigations of individuals
or organizations engaged in activities affecting the national security includ-
ing terrorism, treason, sabotage, espionage, counter-espionage, rebellion or
insurrection, sedition, seditious conspiracy, neutrality matters, Foreign
Agents Registration Act, or any other Statute or Executive Order relating to
national security. Any investigations of such groups or individuals for
any reasons other than in connection with protective responsibilities
must be closely coordinated with and have the concurrence of the FBI in
order to minimize interference with national security responsibilities of
the FBI.

"IV. Information to be Furnished to the United States Secret Service by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

"A. When an individual or group is referred by the FBI to the USSS,
the following information will be furnished to the extent
available:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 230

"Individua Identification data including me or names, addresses, photograph (or statement as to availability of such), physical description, date and place of birth, employment, and marital status.

"Information in FBI Files - A summary, as appropriate, of pertinent portions of any FBI file on an individual or organization referred.

"FBI Identification Records The USSS will make specific requests in each instance where a check of the FBI identification records is desired.

"B. Types of information to be referred:

"1. Information concerning attempts, threats, or conspiracies to injure, kill, or kidnap persons protected by the USSS or other U. S. or foreign officials in the U. S. or abroad.

"2. Information concerning attempts or threats to redress a grievance against any public official by other than legal means, or attempts personally to contact such officiais for that purpose..

"3. Information concerning threatening, irrational, or abusive written or oral statements about U. S. Government or foreign officials.

"4. Information concerning civil disturbances, anti-U. S. demonstrations or incidents or demonstrations against foreign diplomatic establishments.

b. Strong or violent anti-U. S. sentiment.

c. A propensity toward violence.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 231

"7. Information concerning persons who may be considered potentially dangerous to individuals protected by the USSS because of their background or activities, including evidence of emotional instability or participation in groups engaging in activities inimical to the United States.

"V. Provision of Federal Bureau of Investigation Personnel to Protect the President and Other Protected Persons

"The USSS may, in accordance with Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056 request FBI Agents be detailed to the USSS in order to augment the capacity of the USSS to perform its protective duties. Such requests should be addressed to the Director of the FBI.

"FBI Agents detailed to the USSS are under the direction and exclusive operational control of the Director of the USSS for the period of their assignment. The FBI Agents so detailed may perform an armed or other protective function.

"VI. Implementation of Agreement

"In order to effect the best possible security of the President ani certain other persons and places whose protection is the responsibility of the USSS, the FBI and the USSS will construe the terms of this agreement liberally and will take such steps as are necessary to insure the proper exchange and coordination of information.

"The agreement shall be reviewed annually by representatives of the FBI and the USSS, or at such other times as the FBI or the USSS may request, to insure that the agreement is both practical and productive. Revisions may be made on the authority of the Director of the FBI and the Director of the USSS.

"This agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the FBI and the USSS.

Mr. Wannall:

The statement in the attached of the Third Agency rule is accurate and does not present legal problems.

As an observation paragraph number 7 of the document titled "Handling of Third Agency Matters in Response to Congressional Select Committee," dated March 28, 1975, (attached) appears to be subject to various interpretations. This paragraph and in particular the second sentence of the paragraph appears to allow the agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is indirectly involved and the material is sensitive without first contacting the Third Agency. Any notification of the Third Agency in this instance of the furnishing of such information to the Committee would be after the fact. The term indirectly is not defined. Additionally, this paragraph allows the Agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is directly involved and the material is nonsensitive without checking with the Third Agency involved. It would appear the language in paragraph number 7 should be tightened up and the appropriate terms defined.

# THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

28 March 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Ad Hoc Group

SUBJECT: Handling of Third Agency Matters in Response to Congressional Select Committees

1. As you are aware, Senator Church already has submitted to me a long list of materials which he requests be provided to his Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities. He has submitted other lists to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the White House. It is expected that other elements of the Intelligence Community will be hearing from Senator Church.

2. The scope of the investigation necessarily is going to involve Third Agency | relationships to a considerable degree.

3. In the implementation of Executive Order 11652, "Classification and Declassification of National Security Information and Material," the President directed the following:

"D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S. C. 403, classified information or material originating in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any other Department to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating department."

4. As regards Section 102 of the 1947 Act, the following quotes 102 (e) in full:

"(3) To the extent recommended by the National Security Council and approved by the President, such intelligence of the departments and agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter provided, relating to the national security,"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 236

shall be open to the inspection of the Director of Central Intelligence, and such intelligence as relates to the national security and is possessed by such departments and other agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter provided, shall be made available to the Director of Central Intelligence for correlation, evaluation and dissemination: Provided, however, that upon the written request of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall make available to the Director of Central Intelligence such information .. for correlation, evaluation and dissemination as may be essential to the national security."

5. If I am requested to provide certain materials and investigation indicates that the material asked for involves a document which originated within an organization other than the Intelligence Community Staff or the Central Intelligence Agency, the requestor will be asked to redirect his inquiry to the office of origin.

6. It already is apparent, however, that the documentation being requested inevitably is going to include references to inter-relationships among various of the elements of the intelligence 'community. Clearing each and every such reference with every agency mentioned could manifestly be extremely consuming of time and manpower.

7. I propose the Ad Hoc Group agree on the following procedure. Where it appears that truly sensitive matters are involved, the material will be sanitized by the agency concerned and a check will be made with the appropriate Third Agency organizations before release. Where the reference concerns a Third Agency indirectly (or is not considered sensitive and does not pose policy concerns, the agency concerned may forward the material to the requesting Select Committee without an item-by-item, mention-by-mention clearance with Third Agencies. However, in all cases notification that such material has been forwarded will be made to the central index and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 237

all agencies alerted through that mechanism. Agencies will designate on their submissions to the central index, the name and telephone number of the releasing party.

8. Ad hoc members should be prepared to discuss and come to some agreement on this matter at the next meeting.

# The Third Agency Rule

1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked. Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense information originating in another Department or agency" to an agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the consent of the originating Department or agency". The only exception to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Community. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is a homogenous product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order 11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the following controls: Sec. 9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information and material, including those which presently relate to communications intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order 11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassification and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:

A.(2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to a security clearance, a person must have a need for access to the particular classified information or material sought in connection with the performance of his official duties or


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 242

tractual obligations. The dete nation of that need
shall be made by officials having responsibility for the
classified information or material.

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination
by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section
102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495,50
U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating
in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any
other Department to which it has been made available
without the consent of the originating Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.
Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING
NOTICE -- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND
METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any
manner outside authorized channels without the permission
of the originating Department and an assessment by the
senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department
as to the potential risk to the national security and to the
intelligence sources and methods involved.

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The
establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-
bution and protection of classified information and material
under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior
approval of the head of a Depertment or his designes.

5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are
received from all members of the Intelligence Community *and.*
then disseminated to members of the community under the
authority of the DCI;

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State
Department may not be sent by the State Department to
the Department of Commerce without the permission of the
CIA;

(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's
Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or
to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,
a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA
information should be referred to CIA for action so that
the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 242.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 243

If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinction here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate intelligence.

# Memorandum

TO : Mr. Cleveland

FROM : G. R. Steel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

DATE: 4-3-75

By agreement, the FBI is currently conducting full field investigations regarding SSC staff personnel. These have extremely short (2 week) deadlines which are identical to those afforded Presidential appointments and are, therefore, given preferential treatment in opening, assigning, and following field progress. The Special Inquiry Unit of the Employees Security and Special Inquiry Section, which has about twice its normal case load, is handling these requests. Senator Church, Chairman, SSC, originally estimated that between 35 and 40 staff members would be submitted for investigation. As of today, 4-3-75, we have received requests for 65 such investigations from the SSC and the end does not appear to be in sight. They are received in bunches as many as 6 at a time, which is not the even flow expected and presents an additional burden.

In addition it is expected that similar requests will be forthcoming in the near future from the HSC since we have a similar agreement with it. Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the HSC, has estimated "probably no more than about 25 staff members will be hired." It remains to be seen if this estimate also falls short of actual receipts.

Since there is no charge for these full field investigations they will have to be considered in the budget. It is noted the current charge for a full field investigation, where applicable, is $2028.

ACTION: For information. Since it appears the nucleus of the Committee has been formed, it is suggested Senator Church be contacted and queried regarding a more realistic (30 day) deadline on the remaining investigations concerning future staff members and their replacements.

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

This memorandum recommends that the attached draft of a paper prepared by CIA entitled, "Ambiguities and the Law," be reviewed by the Legal Counsel Division for comment and that a member of the Division be named to represent the FBI in future meetings with legal representatives from other U. S. Intelligence Board (USIB) agencies and departments. The purpose of such a group is to develop recommendations for changes in existing laws or the proposal of new legislation which Mr. Colby as the Director of Central Intelligence can offer to the Senate Select Committee for their consideration.

At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community 2/27/75, a draft paper entitled, "Ambiguities and the Law," was distributed to all members. This paper was drafted by Mr. Marvin Smith of CIA. It is considered a starting point for the Intelligence Community to identify areas in existing statutes that should be changed, as well as to recommend new legislation deemed necessary to clarify for the Congress and the American people the authorities, the limitations and missions of various member agencies or departments of the Intelligence Community.

In furnishing copies of this paper to members, the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, Mr. John Clarke, acknowledged the paper presents a starting point and in no way should be considered a final draft. He suggested that Legal Counsel representatives of each agency or department of USIB review the document and submit their comments directly to Mr. Marvin Smith, on Agency code 143, extension 4055. Following the receipt of such comments from the legal offices of member agencies and departments, it was proposed that a meeting would be called in an effort to begin drafting a paper representative of the Intelligence Community which would reflect recommended changes in existing statutes or proposals for new legislation.

# AMBIGUITIES AND THE LAW

DRAFT

CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI and, to some extent, several other Federal Agencies, collect information and produce intelligence, but of different kinds and for different purposes. This is recognized in practice but is not as clearly established in the law. Given some lack of clarity in the law and some uncertainty regarding limits placed on intelligence activities, misunderstanding and fear of abuse of power easily thrive. In reality, however, in the implementation of mission and charters and in direction and control, there are not as many unresolved ambiguities as the uninformed may suppose.

The experience following the National Security Act of 1947 is such that it is now possible to eliminate some of the vagueness of the language of the Act. The certainty and public confidence that should result from clarifications in the law should far outweigh any disadvantages. A number of possible amendments or additions to current laws have already been mentioned, and proposed legislation has already been submitted for some. These ideas and others are suggested, below.

1) Clarify CIA's mission and charter by amending the National Security Act of 1947 to reflect:

--that included in the proper functions of the Agency are (a) collection of foreign intelligence information; (b) conduct of activities to carry out CIA's counter-intelligence responsibilities overseas; and (c) conduct of covert action operations overseas when authorized by the President;

--that CIA's responsibility to produce intelligence relates only to foreign intelligence;

--investigation of employees and other
individuals to be granted access to sensitive
information;

--collection of foreign intelligence
information from foreign nationals and.
from cooperating U.S. citizens;

--establishment of mechanisms in support
of foreign intelligence activities; and

--cooperation with the FBI in investigations
relating to the unauthorized disclosure of
foreign intelligence.

3) Remove uncertainty regarding responsibility for
   internal security matters by modifying appropriate laws to
   establish clearly:

--that the collection of counterintelligence
information in the United States and the
collection of information related to internal
security are functions of the FBI;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 253

-5-

--that the responsibility for the production of intelligence related to internal security rests with the FBI; and

--that with due regard to assessed reliability of the information and responsibilities for protecting sources and methods, those agencies engaged in foreign intelligence activities will make available to the FBI and other Federal agencies, as appropriate, the security and counterintelligence information relating to foreign nationals in the United States and to U.S. citizens which is derived as a by-product of foreign intelligence activities.

4) Recognize international terrorism and international illegal drug activities as threats to U.S. national security and proper targets for U.S. foreign intelligence efforts, as well as for internal security operations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 254

-6-

5) Provide protection against the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and methods by:

--providing for the protection of intelligence sources and methods on a statutory basis independent of Executive Order 11652;

--clarifying that the Director of Central Intelligence is responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods related to *foreign intelligence* and foreign counterintelligence;

--assigning to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation the duty of protecting intelligence sources and methods related to internal security and to counterintelligence within the United States;

--imposing specific burdens, upon officers and employees of all branches of the government and others granted official access, not to disclose such information without authorization.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 255

-7-

and providing criminal sanctions for unauthorized disclosures;

--establishing effective injunctive recourse, through the Attorney General, for protection of all intelligence sources and methods;

--providing for *in camera* judicial review of material revealing intelligence sources and methods when relevant and necessary to criminal and civil proceedings;

--delineating authorities and responsibilities for investigating suspected or discovered unauthorized disclosures by (a) U.S. citizens overseas and (b) all persons within the United States.

6) Delineate areas of interagency assistance that facilitate performance of authorized missions, promote economy of resources, and as a matter of policy are desirable, for example:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 256

-8-

--cooperation in research and development
of technical collection and information pro-
cessing equipment, methods and techniques;

--loan or supply of equipment, methods and
techniques;

--provision of training in special skills and
techniques;

--passage of information derived as a by-
product of foreign intelligence activities to
those agencies responsible for the matters
involved.

A few changes in the procedures for reviewing intelligence
activities might add considerable understanding and confidence. Of
paramount importance is a form of congressional oversight that permits
the provision to Congress of the necessary information in a timely,
efficient and controlled manner. It is recognized that a number of
Committees in both the Senate and House must be informed of sub-
stantive intelligence, operational matters and fiscal details in varying
degrees. Just as in the executive branch, the test of access should be


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 257

-9-

"need-to-know." To apply this test and to control and protect sensitive information provided to Congress, a focal point within Congress would be extremely helpful. Whether a joint committee or not, such a focal point would also be valuable in facilitating changes in laws affecting intelligence activities. Congress might find that a more uniform approach to budget presentation and review would provide better insight and understanding.

The foregoing suggestions are by no means definitive. They do, however, present areas that in the experience of the intelligence community deserve careful attention.

1 - Mr. S. F. Phillips

Project Senstudy 75, established within the Intelligence Division, for the purpose of developing a capability of implementing requests received from the Select Committees of the Congress. Bureau file 62-116395 has been opened for this Project.

Because of the unusual factors relating to this entire Project, such as the sensitive nature of much of the material involved, urgency for handling, necessity for having the file very readily available to the working staff at all times, and similar other reasons, it is essential that the file be maintained in the work area of the Project which, effective 4/14/75, will be in room 4063, JEH. The purpose of this memorandum, therefore, is to have Files and Communications Division take necessary steps to arrange for the maintenance of the file in the designated room rather than in the usual manner.

There has already been much publicity about the Select Committees and we anticipate much more. This involves many newspaper stories. It is, therefore, believed very desirable that a Sub A file to the main file be opened as the standardized repository for newspaper articles, As a first step, it will be necessary that a few articles already in the main file be extracted and placed in the new Sub A file in the usual chronological order.

The foregoing matters have been already discussed with Mr. J. W. Awe, Unit Chief, of the Files and Communications Division.

RECOMMENDATION:

This memorandum to be referred to the Files and Communications Division for appropriate action as above.

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

In attached W. O. Cregar to Mr. W. R. Wannall memorandum of 3-6-75, captioned as above, it is recommended that the Legal Counsel Division coordinate and assign responsibilities to appropriate Divisions for the collection and preparation of certain materials we can anticipate the Senate Select Committee (SSC) will soon request from the FBI.

In this regard, it is suggested that all Divisions receiving requests for information in connection with testimony before this Committee respond in the same commendable and expeditious manner that they responded in connection with the preparation of the Director's Brief on his testimony before the House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights. The format of this information should generally be as follows:

1 - Heading in all caps, centered, brief description of contents;

2 - White, watermarked bond paper, 8 x 10 1/2";

3 - At least a 2" left margin. This is essential since material will be inserted into a folder;

4 - Double spaced;

5 - Do not number pages;

6 - Each Division will be responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information furnished in final form. This will also include up-dating any information previously furnished;

7 - Use "Mag" card typewriter (courier ball); identifying caption on the card folder should be adequate to readily identify it with the corresponding paper. In addition to the caption card folder should also have the name of the originating Division.

8 - Furnish all "Mag" cards to the Legislative Matters Section, Legal Counsel Division, along with the write-up

Re: Senstudy 75

All mail should be routed through and coordinated with the Legislative Matters Section, Legal Counsel Division, and all contacts with the Senate and House committees will be handled by representatives of the Legal Analysis Office, Legislative Matters Section, Legal Counsel Division.

Each Division should advise the Legislative Matters Section the identity of individual who will be the contact and coordinator of that Division's responsibilities along with his phone extension.

The Intelligence Division will be responsible for representing the Bureau on the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group and the identity of such individual should be made known to the Legislative Matters Section. In addition, the Intelligence Division should accumulate the data identified in paragraphs 1 and 2, as they pertain to the FBI, in Mr. John M. Clarke's memorandum to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group and submit this in the form suggested above.

The Administrative Division is requested to obtain the information set forth in paragraph 3 of Mr. Clarke's memorandum, also furnishing this data in narrative form as explained above.

1 - Each Assistant Director

1 - Mr. Cregar

This memorandum recommends that the Legal Counsel Division coordinate and assign responsibilities to appropriate Divisions for the collection and preparation of certain materials we anticipate the Senate Select Committee (SSC) will soon request from the FBI.

Memorandum W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall, dated 3/5/75, reported the results of a meeting between Senator Church and Mr. Colby wherein Senator Church advised he anticipated asking all agencies and departments of the Intelligence Community for (1) Organizational charts broken down to a branch level going back to 1947, (2) Copies of all budgets since 1947 and (3) Documents reflecting all cash flows since 1947.

Attached is a copy of a short letter from Mr. John Clarke, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community to Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director, SSC. Also attached is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Clarke to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community. This memorandum sets out in more detail what information the SSC will be seeking from all agencies making up the Intelligence Community. It should be noted that on page two of Mr. Clarke's memorandum he notes a formal request from Senator Church to all agencies can be expected.

The Intelligence Division believes considerable time and effort will be required from several Divisions to pull this information together. It is believed we should begin now to assemble the data in anticipation of a request.

ACTION: If you agree, the Legal Counsel Division will coordinate this matter and assign responsibilities to appropriate Division for the collection and preparation of the material we anticipate the SSC will request from the FBI.

Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities
United States Senate
Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Mr. Miller:

Pursuant to your request, I have advised all members of the Ad Hoc
Group of the United States Intelligence Board and Mr. Thomas K. Latimer,
Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, of Senator Church's request
to provide legal authority and organization charts of USIB entities from
their inception. I also have alerted them to the Committee's desire for
comprehensive historical data on personnel, budgets, and cash flow for
the same periods. They will expect to hear more directly from Senator
Church on these matters.

By early next week, we will begin providing you the CIA data in
response to the Chairman's request. The first set of annexes developed
under the auspices of the USIB Ad Hoc Group is ready and I am having
five copies of each run off for your use. Please advise if more copies
are desired.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Principals of the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group on Congressional Review

SUBJECT: Information Requested by Senate Select
Committee Staff Director

1. Senator Church has asked the Director to provide to the Senate Select Committee copies of CIA legal authorities and organization charts to branch levels, 1947-1975. He also indicated he wants similar authorities and charts for all USIB entities from their inceptions. In the case of CIA this will be from 1947; NSA from 1952; DIA from 1961; etc.

2. The Committee is seeking a comprehensive historical base line for each U.S. intelligence organization--its structure and the people involved over time. Therefore, Senator Church has asked that the names of all incumbents who have held supervisory responsibilities over the period, down through the branch level, also be provided. The Staff Director has been made aware of the difficulties involved in tracing personnel assignments too far back but asks that every effort be made to meet the request. CIA is proceeding accordingly.

3. Senator Church has also asked for budget and cash flow data on all U.S. intelligence organizations from their inceptions. The CIA finds that the source and uses tables, employed in annual financial reports, provides the historical profile desired. Supplemental data on specific programs can follow if requested. Senator Church wants data which will show specific patterns of expenditures

4. The Senate Select Committee will be ready to receive classified material this week. It is suggested that Ad Hoc Group members begin assembling the legal, organizational, personnel, and budgetary data for early submission.

By memorandum Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams dated 3/12/75, the Legal Counsel Division indicated that its Legislative Matters Section would coordinate and assign responsibilities within the Bureau for the collection and preparation of material for the Senate Select Committee.

This memorandum instructed Intelligence Division to accumulate data which was identified in a memorandum from Mr. John M. Clarke from the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group of the Intelligence Committee. Clarke's memorandum was attached to W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall memorandum dated 3/6/75. The identified data to be collected outlined in Clarke's memorandum was proposed-type data that the Senate Select Committee has indicated an interest in.

In view of 3/19/75 letter subsequently received from Senator Frank Church (Democrat, Idano), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee, to the Attorney General outlining a request for specific FBI documents they are interested in receiving, the Intelligence Division has begun accumulating this specific data. In view of this request for specific data, the Intelligence Division will not accumulate the data outlined in the Clarke memorandum since it was only in the nature of proposed data and differs from the specific data to be collected which is extensive in nature.

ATTN: BUDGET AND ACCOUNTING SECTION

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE BUTEL, MARCH 24 LAST.

LOS ANGELES DIVISION HAS CAREFULLY BROKEN DOWN BY PERCENTAGES
THOSE AGENTS WORKING INTERNAL SECURITY AND COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE
WORK USING THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS PROVIDED BY SUPERVISOR GROOVER.
DIVISION HAS A TOTAL OF 91 AGENTS PLUS ONE SAC, FOUR SUPERVISORS
ASSIGNED TO INTERNAL SECURITY AND ONE SUPERVISOR ASSIGNED TO
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, ASSIGNED TO SUCH CLASSIFICATIONS. THIRTY
FIVE OF THESE WORK COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND 56 WORK INTERNAL SECURITY.

ADMINISTRATIVE

LOS ANGELES IS SUBMITTING FOR BUREAU'S CONSIDERATION, IF
PERTINENT. THREE OF THE ABOVE 56 CLASSIFIED AS SECURITY AGENTS
WORK FULL TIME ON BOMBING MATTERS WHICH ARE ALMOST ALL MATTERS
WHEREIN WE HAVE NO JURISDICTION EXCEPT FOR DATA KEEPING FOR
NATIONAL BOMB DATA CENTER. TWELVE OF THE 56 SECURITY AGENTS

ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN OUR FALSE IDENTITY PROGRAM. THIS
PROGRAM ORIGINATED WITH OUR WEATHFUG ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER,
THE FRAUDULENT USE OF DECEASED INFANT IDENTITY PAPERS HAS
EXPANDED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY INVOLVE
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN SECURITY WORK. SEVEN OF THE 56
AGENTS ON SECURITY ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN FUGITIVE
INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ORIGINATE WITH SOME DEMONSTRATION OR
ACT OF TERROR, ETC, BUT AT THE PRESENT THEY ARE CLEAR CUT
CRIMINAL FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS. ONE OF THE 56 IS INVOLVED
FULL TIME IN THE HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICE COOPERATION
MATTERS WHICH IS TECHNICALLY AN APPLICANT-TYPE INVESTIGATION,
BUT THE 163 CLASSIFICATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE SECURITY
CLASSIFICATIONS. SUMMARIZING THESE EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE A TOTAL
OF 23 AGENTS WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO SECURITY WORK BUT ARE, IN
FACT, NOT INVOLVED IN ANY INTERNAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS,
LEAVING ONLY 33 AGENTS DEVOTING THEIR FULL TIME EFFORTS TO
INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS PLUS, THE ABOVE MENTIONED 35
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AGENTS.

Memorandum captioned as above, 3/27/75, from Legal Counsel to you, noted that you and Wannall were to meet with Mr. Hills and Mr. Phillip Buchen, Counsel to the President, on 3/28/75. Your addendum to the memorandum pointed out the results of this meeting and the various matters discussed.

As a follow-up to this meeting, you, Legal Counsel Mintz and Wannall met on 4/4/75 with Mr. James Wilderotter, who is presently working under Mr. Buchen in coordinating intelligence community matters relating to the inquiries underway by the Senate Select Committee. Mr. Wilderotter was given a briefing similar to that which had been afforded to Buchen and Hills. In addition, the discussion covered matters of a sensitive nature relating to the ORCHID and similar programs, electronic surveillances, specialized handling of informants, and Bureau Source 4 (access to social security records). Many of these matters discussed covered topics with which Mr. Wilderotter had become familiar when he was assigned to the Department as an Assistant to former Deputy Attorney General Silberman.

Wilderotter said it was the feeling at The White House that while raw FBI files should not be made available to the Committee, it might be necessary to permit the Committee to review a few such files in order that the integrity of the FBI could be established with the Committee. It was pointed out to him that we did not agree to this that we could furnish summaries of material from the files Wilderotter said he did not feel that

furnishing reports and letterhead memoranda which had been
prepared for dissemination would satisfy the Committee's
needs. He was advised by both you and Mr. Mintz that it was
our feeling that we should not furnish the raw material but
summaries could be prepared for the Committee's purposes and
if necessary, Bureau officials could be placed under oath
and attest to the correctness of the summaries. Wilderotter
said that this was a matter which he would afford further
consideration.

As during the conference with Buchen and Hills,
it was obvious as the result of our meeting with Wilderotter
that The White House was most anxious that it not be caught
by surprise by revelations of activities which in any way
might be considered questionable. The White House is making
every effort possible to become cognizant of any such situation
prior to the Committee hearings.

Classified "Top Secret" to protect highly sensitive
investigative techniques and matters relating to foreign
relations.

ACTION:

For information. Further contacts with Wilderotter
or other White House Staff Members will be duly reported.

# UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to letter dated March 19, 1975, to the Attorney General from the Chairman of captioned Committee, which enclosed certain requests for documents and other information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

One of the requests contained in referenced letter was for a list of names and titles of all Intelligence Division personnel at FBI Headquarters down to and including unit chiefs, together with a number of personnel below the level of unit chief categorized by unit. At a meeting on April 1, 1975, Inspector John B. Hotis and Special Agent Paul V. Daly discussed this request with Mr. William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee. It was agreed that the request as stated would be modified and that the FBI would prepare a list of personnel in the Intelligence Division down to the level of unit chief, with names included, which would be made available for review by appropriately cleared personnel of the committee staff at FBI Headquarters.

This is to advise that the list has been prepared and is available for review under the above conditions.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adaıns

FROM : Legal Counsel

DATE: 3-21-75

SUBJECT: JOHN T. ELLIFF
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF POLITICS
BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY
WALTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS

On 3-18-75 Professor Join T. Elliff advised Inspector John B. Hotis that he had been contacted by William Miller, Staff Director for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, and was asked to serve as Director of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. This is one of four Task Forces being formed by the Select Committee and it will focus primarily on the activities of the FBI. The other Task Forces are on Foreign Intelligence, Military and Technological Intelligence, and Command and Control.

Elliff said he had not decided whether to accept the offer and believed that others were also being considered for the position. He said he was reluctant to do anything that would interfere with the excellent working arrangements he had developed with the Bureau. He feels that his initial obligation is to the Director, and the purpose of going to the Police Foundation was to get formal support for a project that would be of primary benefit to the Bureau and only secondarily to the Attorney General and Congress He said he would be guided by our judgment in this matter and not want to break any commitments that he might have made with the Bureau.

If he accepts the appointment Elliff said he would, of course, suspend work on his research project until he had terminated his employment with the Committee. He said he would also agree not to use any classified material that he acquired in his capacity as Task Force Director. Elliff has discussed this matter with John Heaphy, Assistant Director of the Police Foundation. Heaphy said the Foundation had no objections whatsoever for his accepting the position with the Senate Select Committee, and he would be free to resume his project after the Committee work was done.

# Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
RE: JOHN T. ELLIFF

It should be noted that the Select Committee considered offering the position to Larry Baskir, Counsel to the President's Clemency Board. Mr. Baskir formerly served as Chief Counsel to Senator Ervin's Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and we had numerous contacts with him in that capacity. Our purpose was to reach some common agreement on privacy legislation that Senator Ervin planned to introduce in the 93rd Session of Congress. There were numerous meetings with Baskir on the same subject in the Deputy Attorney General's office. These efforts proved unsuccessful and after several months we discontinued the discussions. In our opinion, Mr. Baskir was unwilling to work out any reasonable compromise and seemed unsympathetic to the legislation concerns of law enforcement.

It is clear that this is a matter for Professor Elliff to determine and the Bureau should not express an official opinion. Although we have not always agreed with his views on intelligence matters, we have had no occasion to question his objectivity or his integrity as a scholar. Mr. Miller knows that Professor Elliff enjoys our confidence and it is our understanding that he offered Elliff the position in order to avoid an adversary relationship between the Bureau and the Committee.

Professor Elliff said he would make no commitments to the Senate Committee until he hears from us.

RECOMMENDATION:

That Professor Elliff be advised that it would be inappropriate for us to express an opinion on whether he should accept the appointment offered by the Senate Select Committee.

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the afternoon of 3/25/75.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; the then Deputy AG Laurence Silberman, Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter; Mr. John Clarke, as well as officials from Defense, Treasury, National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, and the Energy Research and Development Administration.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee (SSC), and the Committee's Counsel, Mr. F.A.O. Schwarz, III, visited CIA Headquarters to discuss SSC business. Mr. Miller suggested that a tactic the SSC was considering is the identification of several key issues that the Committee could look into in-depth. For example, the SSC might propose to identify two or three covert actions engaged in by CIA and examine them in-depth rather than try to cover each and every covert action CIA might identify. Colby advised that this appeared to be an encouraging development and possibly each agency of the Intelligence Community might be asked to provide a series of key issues from which the Select Committee could select one or two for an in-depth study.

The question of the SSC Staff signing a Secrecy Agreement is still not settled. The Staff Director raised some constitutional questions regarding the Secrecy Agreement. Mr. Schwarz admitted, however, that some type of arrangement would have to be made to insure that the Intelligence Community had some protection against unauthorized disclosures by staff members of the SSC.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Both Miller and Schwarz accepted the Third Agency
Rule and agreed to abide by it. For the record, the SSC's
interpretation of the Third Agency Rule (which is consistent
with the Intelligence Community) is as follows: Classified
information or material originating in one department shall
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it
has been made available without the consent of the originating
department.

The Security Committee of the United States Intelli-
gence Board (USIB) will meet to develop some ground rules and
standardization for sanitizing documents to be furnished to
the Select Committees.

The question of Intelligence Community personnel being
represented by counsel was discussed. The position of the White
House on this issue has been fully reported in a memorandum from
the Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, dated 3/27/75, entitled "Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, Rodney Hills
Associate Counsel to the President."

It was also agreed at the meeting of 3/25/75 that the
President's Counsel would attempt to negotiate with the SSC to
insure that all interviews of Intelligence Community personnel
would be conducted on the premises of the bureau, agency or
department employing the persons to be interviewed.

Attached also for the record are the following:

A letter dated 3/20/75 from Staff Director William G.
Miller to Mr. John Clarke advising that Mr. Ben Marshall has been
designated as the Security Officer of the SSC;

A letter dated 3/17/75 from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke
listing employees of the SSC who have been cleared by the
Committee for certification by CIA for access to classified
information up to and including "Top Secret";

A letter from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke dated 3/20/75
advising that Mr. Ben Marshall was cleared for access to
classified information up to and including "Top Secret";

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Committee advising that arrangements had been perfected for
the delivery of classified documents to the SSC and describing

# LIVER FUNCTION TESTS

On 24 October 1968, I saw Dr. Daly of the Bio-chemistry
Laboratory of West London Hospital for liver function
tests. My family doctor, Dr. Hodes, sent me to Daly as
a private patient, as British practice is not to take these
tests unless the patient's condition seems to be worsening.
My doctor thought I showed no signs of a recurrence of
hepatitis and the normal practice would have been, at most,
for me to have been examined by the specialist at the
hospital, who might then decide to ask for the tests.

Daly said that all required tests, except the B.S.P.,
would be done. He said he thought the 3.5.2. unnecessary
unless the others indicated negative factors. In which
case, he said he would ask me to come in again for that.
test.

Daly will send me the results of the tests and his bill
c/o American Express, Rome, within a week.

1. After considering several alternatives and given QRPHONE/1's
   lack of financial forward planning, LCPIPIT believes that it would
   be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a
   portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both
   life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-
   cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of
   such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement
   and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.
   We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals
   which he has received from the local representative of a reputable
   WOLADY insurance firm.

2. LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the
   cost of a life insurance program for QRPHONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion
   not to exceed $50 per month.) From an administration standpoint
   this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and
   we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were
   indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

FROM Chief of Station, London

SUBJECT RYBAT/DTDORIC/ORPHONE
CRPHONE/1 Physical Condition

REFERENCE: OEPA-1312, 10 September 1968

1.  On the basis of the documentation submitted under reference dispatch, the Medical Staff feels that ORPHONE/I made a surprisingly fast recovery and seems well on the way to complete health. However, the hospital report (a quick translation of which into English is attached for your ready reference), dated as it is, still reflects some inconclusive levels in the results of the various chemical tests shown. Undoubtedly these have by now been lowered to completely safe levels, since ORPHONE/1 apparently felt well enough to travel to France, but the Medical Staff believes it would be advisable for CRPHONE/1 to undergo another series of liver function tests, to include the following:

a. SGOT
b. SGPT
c. Bilirubin

(1) Direct
(2) Indirect
(3) Total

d. B.S.P. (Bromsulfophthalein)
e. Serum Proteins

Albumin
Globulin
Total

We assume QRPHONE/1 has consulted his own physician on his return to the UK, but the Medical Staff has pointed out that clinical examination alone is not always sufficient to determine complete recovery from hepatitis.

2. In terms of our operational utilization of QRPHONE/1 at this time, while they reserve finite comment until all the returns (per above) are in, the Medical Staff did stress the paramount importance proper rest and of not over-taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular, warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed, and complete absence of alcohol, in order to prevent a relapso. So long as these caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However, since he also has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the Kambona offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimum for the time being.

3. The Medical Staff will be glad to review any further chemical tests per para, 1 above suggestions, or any others which his doctor may have already run.

1. At their meeting on 4 September QRPHONE/1 submitted a
   report to RODIGAST on his hospitalization for hepatitis. Attached
   to his report is a copy of this medical record with results of
   blood and urine analyses written in Serbo-Croatian. We are
   forwarding a copy of the report under separate cover for evaluation
   by the Medical Staff. We are interested in having as thorough as
   possible an evaluation made of QRPHONE/1's illness in order that
   we may assure ourselves of his condition and the degree to which
   he ought to be active in the forthcoming months. We will appre-
   ciate it if Headquarters will pursue this matter with the Medical
   Staff and advise us of its findings and recommendations.

2. Also forwarded under separate cover is a memorandum
   prepared from RODIGAST's notes which elaborates upon QRPHONE/1's
   symptoms.

# HEPATITIS BOUT

What I had thought was a touch of malaria and the extreme fatigue I felt when I returned to London in July proved in time to have been acute infectious hepatitis. The disease -- which takes two to three weeks to develop -- was probably contracted in Uganda. At least, I imagine so because my principal contact in Kampala insisted on taking me to a number of local restaurants of dubious cleanliness to sample Uganda delicacies.

Hepatitis was diagnosed by a doctor in Komiza, Vis, where my family had been holidaying since the beginning of July, and I was hospitalized in the isolation section of Split Hospital (there is no hospital on Vis) on the 7th of August.

My liver was swollen by one finger and blood and urine analysis indicated a fairly severe infection. Treatment consisted of terramycin and cortisone therapy, with massive doses of vitamins.

I was put on a fat-free diet, which I have been told to follow for at least six months. Naturally, no alcohol.

On 20 August, I was released from the hospital, mainly because I was pestering the doctors to let me go. I was told to have *"absolute rest* for four to six weeks and to have another blood test within several weeks.

(Attached is the Yugoslav doctor's description of my case and treatment, with results of all blood and urine analyses. It is written ærurruun in Serbo-Croatian.)

7 September 1968

1.  The following information was obtained by /1 at their meeting on 4 September 1968. It supplements the report which was submitted by /1 which deals with his recent hospitalization for hepatitis.

2.  Toward the end of his African trip /1 had been feeling rather weak and nauseous, with no appetite. He was constipated, feverish and had gas pains. These symptoms persisted and after his return from Africa and on 6 August, while in Yugoslavia on vacation, /1 suffered from acute gas pains and vomiting. He was taken from Vis, where he was vacationing, to Split where he was hospitalized. The address of this hospital is:

Opca Bolnica
Zarazni Odjel (Firule)
Split, Yugoslavia

His doctor was Dr. Juraj FILIPOVIC.

3.  /1's treatment was free inasmuch as he was able to show his British National Health Card and a reciprocity agreement exists between Britain and Yugoslavia.

4.  /1 states that at no time did he receive narcotics nor was he ever unconscious. During his stay in the hospital a young British youth (Derek WHITTAKER, age 19, from Shoreham-by-Sea, Surrey) was in his ward suffering from food poisioning.

Split
Yugoslavia
13 August 1968.

Dear Mrs. Randall,

Unexpectedly, I found myself in this hospital in Split, Yugoslavia, on the 7th of August, confined to the isolation ward with a fairly rough case of infectious hepatitis, undoubtedly picked up in Cost Africa. (They tell me the incubation period is about 3 weeks.) In any case, I am hoping to be released from here in another 10 or 15 days at the most. The treatment is good and occurs thorough. My biggest problem was originally linguistic. I still speak with the doctors, who know no English, in German or Italian, but my knowledge of Serbo-Croatian has increased steadily with the injections, blood testing and intravenous injections of glucoesaline solution, etc.

The urgency behind this note is, through you, to inform the firm of my condition. I hope to return to London - without many, if any days on the beach - as planned, but I am told that I should restrict our activities physically for another month. There are many things to do in Britain and on the Continent, but I regret not being able to undertake the conference assignment in September, etc.

-- 201 --

Fortunatty, my family is on Vis, an island 5 hours bostride from Split, and have not had their vacation completity ruined because of me. Sixe this is em islation hospital f infection's diseases, no visitors are allowed and has is no temptation or urgency on my wife to make that lingtay creating fast to see us, to me, also, my holiday on the beach in the sun has simply satinal into lying on my book in a hot room, buy it could be worse and I hope to bedap and about in the next week or two, at wort. I feel certain that I will be able to meet all my commitments in London and dserske at the beg maming of September. I wanted to draw the finn's attention, as soon as posible, to my possible inability of ball another lie craignment rimmedately.

# SECRET RETREAT

April 66

## REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT

1.  QRPHONE/1 collaborates with WOFIRM as a Field Agent who provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has received a Provisional Operational Approval, dated 23 MAY 66. Financial aspects of his activity are charged to approved Project ORPHONE.

2.  QRPHONE/1's employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965, was originally formalized by a Letter of Agreement for a period of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Commitment dated 1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains in effect (as amended) since that date, ORPHONE/1's employment continues on a month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a 30-day notice.

3.  QRPHONE/1 receives the following financial entitlements:

a. Compensation so computed as to give QRPHONE/1 a "tax-free" income of $800 per month (this figure effective 1 July 1967).

    NOTE: The actual breakdown of QRPHONE/1's finances as carried on WOFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Headquarters to discharge QRPHONE/1's WOLADY tax obligation. These taxes are remitted through the Covert Tax Committee. This procedure was devised to honor the original "tax free" commitment made at the time of his recruitment and at the same time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.

b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel unless these are paid by other sources in which case WOFIRM will offset such outside reimbursement against WOFIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1.

    Since security considerations preclude processing of detailed accountings for miscellaneous operational expenses, and as an added inducement to QRPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain confidential information of interest to WOFIRM, a small operational payment, as authorized by Chief, LCPIPIT will be made to QRPHONE/1 for each day during which he is required to be absent from his home on confidential business.

    NOTE: Write-off of the funds passed to QRPHONE/1 is to be effected on the basis of the procedure approved by Chief, LCPIPIT and COS/London, a copy of which is attached. This procedure is authorized in view of the security considerations applicable to QRPHONE/1 and the need to limit the knowledge of this operation within WOMACE.

c. QRPHONE/1 is authorized to receive a non-accountable office allowance of $100 per month.

- 2 -

4. QRPHONE/1 will be compensated by WOFIRM in an amount mutually agreed upon for the relocation of himself and his family to a new residence if such relocation is considered desirable by him and WOFIRM. NOTE: This provision was included in ORPHONE/I's original Letter of Agreement and was retained in this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for QRPHONE/1 to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.

5. WOFIRM has arranged for a portion of QRPHONE/1's financial entitlements to be funded to him by QRPURE, which has also agreed to repatriate QRPHONE/1 to WOLADY. This has been done for operational reasons to enable QRPHONE/1 to qualify for foreign residence. Should QRPURE be obliged to honor this commitment, WOFIRM will guarantee this QRPURE commitment and will reimburse QRPURE for any costs incurred.

6. LCPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by QRPHONE/1 of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-accountable and which shall be charged against the operational expense category of approved Project QRPHONE.

7. QRPHONE/1 signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true name) at the time of his original recruitment. He is aware that its provisions are still in effect.

8. QRPHONE/1 is aware that he may be required, from time to time, to undertake an SGSWIRL.

9. QRPHONE/1 is aware of all provisions of the Memorandum of Oral Commitment with the exceptions of paragraph 6, which describes an internal WOFIRM procedure; certain aspects of paragraph 3a--specifically that WOFIRM is paying LNFORT taxes in his behalf; and certain aspects of paragraph 3b--specifically the procedure for write-off of funds since this is an internal WOFIRM procedure.

INLAND REVENUE MONOLOGUE (required)

Until April of this year (1968), I lived mainly on assistance from my wife's family and occasional freelance journalism outside Britain. Also, I had some savings and investments in America and Switzerland to draw upon. My brother-in-law, Gordon Kaye, purchased a house at 32 Hartswood Road, Stamford Brook, London, W.12 for us - the price of the house being considered a loan to be repaid over the years as is possible. My children's school fees were paid by convenant by my brother-in-law, as well as a grant in convenant to my youngest daughter.

I was not a legal resident of the U.K. until 8 April 1968, and on that date I began officially my duties as Overseas Representative and Correspondent for Negro Press International of Chicago, with a salary of $300 per month.

2.  As said in Reference B, QRPHONE/1 does not fall into the category of WOFIRM asset usually handled by LCPIPIT. This fact plus the very stringent security considerations which must apply to this operation dictate that certain procedure be followed in QRPHONE/1's case. Handling of this case has been facilitated by Headquarters' understanding and approval of the need for such care.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: QRPHONE/1 FINANCES

1. This memorandum outlines a new procedure which is to be allowed in the handling of the operational costs of field agent ORPHONE/1. This new procedure is being instituted in order to enhance the security and compartmentation of the handling of the administrative aspect of this project and parallels revisions in the handling of operational traffic. The new procedure which is discussed below is in accordance with accepted field procedures.

2. Currently QRPHONE/1 receives advances and accounts for these with detailed statements of expenses accompanied by true income receipts, etc. These accountings and the accompanying receipts have been maintained in the LCPIPIT files. This system is to be changed. Henceforth monies for operational expenses are to be given to QRPHONE/1 by his handler (Career Agent Rufus P. RODIGAST) and will be carried on RODIGAST's accountings as operational expenses supported by receipts from QRPHONE/1 acknowledging receipt of the funds. This RODIGAST accounting and the QRPHONE/1 receipt will be used for write-off of the funds against approved project QRPHONE. No detailed accountings and no receipts carrying QRPHONE/1's true name are to be maintained in the LCPIPIT/Admin files.

3. It will be the responsibility of Chief, LCPIPIT and the project case officer to ensure that QRPHONE/1 is supplied with the funds necessary for the furtherance of the operation and to ensure that these amounts are carefully controlled to avoid over-payment. In discharging this responsibility the Chief, LCPIPIT may require advances to itemize the various expenses covered by the payments.

SEPARATE COVER ATTACHMENT TO:

ΟΕΡΑ-892

ARREST AND EXPULSION PROM SWITZERLAND

Brigue, 20 Jan. 1968.

The Milan-Geneva TEE reached the Swiss border at Brigue at about 1030. It was evident that the Border Police were expecting me -- the usual lone civilian inspector of passports was accompanied by a uniformed policeman. I was taken, with baggage, to the station immigration office. My wife went with me, but was apparently not covered by the ban on me. When the official in charge of the office phoned Lausanne and Berne, he was informed that I was to be expelled immediately and that they did not want to interrogate me.

Great effort was made by the official in charge of the office to be polite, especially when I made a rather vigorous protest at the expulsion, claiming that I had never been informed of the ban on my entry in Switzerland, said to date from 16 Dec. 1963, and that, in any case, I had visited Switzerland on numerous occasions since 1963 without interference. Moreover, I was a professional journalist accredited to the United Nations and was indeed on my way to Geneva to visit the U.N. Office there, I said. The official seemed somewhat baffled by this, because he had been informed I was en route to Lausanne, but I showed my tickets valid to Geneva. Nevertheless, with the greatest of apologies, I was escorted this time by a plain-clothesman to a train back to Italy at 1130. My wife could have stayed in Switzerland but I asked her to return with me.

During my detention, my wife phoned Gilbert Etienne in Lausanne, informing him of the situation, the Associated Press office in Geneva (speaking to a Mr. Atkins) and the U.S. Press Attaché, Frederick Steiner, in Berne. Actually, I had told her to phone as many wire services as possible, but she assumed I also wanted to get the Press Attaché to protest on my behalf. In any case, the shortness of time between trains prevented her from making more calls.

When given the attached formal notice of the travel ban by the Swiss official, I refused his request that I sign it and warned that the expulsion was a violation of Swiss agreements concerning the freedom of access to the U.N. Office in Geneva which I fully intended to protest formally and bring to world attention.

Later, from Verona, I spoke myself with Gilbert Etienne, who was convinced -- quite correctly, I believe that his phone is tapped and that my arrival was communicated to the Swiss Federal Police through a phone conversation I had with Etienne from

swiss explusion - 2 last

Miian Ja 18 Jan. (My teen reservation was made in lilan, not London.) I also spoke with Atkins of AP in Coneva, who told me he had filed a story after my wife's call about an American Negro Journalist being refused entry into Switzerland. He asked for more background on me, claiming that New York had expressed interest in developments. Atkins believed that I could get the ban listed by protesting to the Swiss Press Attaché in London as a professional newsman. He said he believed Swiss authorities were rather jumpy about "suspicious" individuals entering the country since the large Biafran shipments of Nigerian currency to Zurich earlier in January. Whatever the real reason, although I do resent not being able to talk with Etienne -- I was counting on him to reestablish links with Nils Andersson in Albania and to give me a picture of the altered situation among pro-Chinese Communist parties in Western Europe since the latest split from Jacques Grippa's party in Belgium --, I think the expulsion is a most useful incident to prove that I am indeed a good revolutionary and I intend to exploit it as fully as possible, within reason. That is, no overt diatribes against "how the Man operates in Switzerland," say in the Los Angeles Herald Dispatch, but to inform as many people on the Left as possible of the incident and let them draw their own conclusions.

Michael Bakafa/Petros Defta, who was expecting me in Geneva for an interview on 22 Jan. was informed by a wire from Verona that force majeure prevented me from keeping the appointment and that I would be writing him when I returned to London.

# DISPATCH

Chief of Station: London for LCPIPIT

1. We appreciate LAGENTSERPA's effort to combine and bring up to date all commitsments made to CREHONE/1 in a revised MOC, forwarded under REF A. We hope that the following comments, geared to the paragraphs as numbered in the MOC, will help to further streamline the product:

a. Para. 1:

Please see Reference B, DURAT dispatch.

b. Para. 2:

As indicated in the REF A covering dispatch, CREHONE/1's initial employment began 1 June 1965, rather than the 1 September 1965 date given in the draft MOC. Since the effective date of his relationship with WOFIRM will one day be the basis for an equitable terminal settlement, or might assume other administrative significance, we suggest that the para- graph be amended to reflect this: "CREHONE/1's employment with WOFIRM which began 1 June 1965, was originally formalized by a Letter of Agreement for a period of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Commitment dated 1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains in effect (as amended) since that date, CREHONE/1's employment continues on a month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on 30-day notice."

GRPW-169

c. Paragraph 16:

From talking with R*******N, it would appear that the line of demarcation between OPTIONE/1's meal "salary" and his "non-accountable op" is so vague to him (if indeed he was ever fully aware of it in our own bureaucratic formulation) as to be virtually non-existent. It is equally confusing and often unrecognizable in other administrative paperwork (see: FMF 'C'). The $100 has already been adjudicated taxable and the $70 supplement has been computed as tax due on the $6000 total. We suggest, therefore, in the interest of administrative simplicity, that we convert the total $1000 to salary, and amend the MOC to reflect this.

d. Paragraph 3b:

A question came up concerning OPTIONE/1's per diem in connection with the three recordings which RODICAST submitted for processing direct at Headquarters. Included were several operational lunches and dinners. OPTIONE/1 indicated he was leaving the computation of per diem due him up to Headquarters (we have allowed for 27 days @ $30 per day). Since regulations state that no one may receive double compensation for any reimbursable expenditure, and OPTIONE/1's per diem by definition is supposed to cover food, etc., we will have to deduct 15% for each meal specifically claimed by him in his detailed accounting (i.e., $3.00 per meal). This will be the subject of separate correspondence when the accounting are processed and we c/c the appropriate amount for credit to OPTIONE/1's account, but we raise it now as we are not certain as to OPTIONE/1's intent or previous practice in this regard. The amount that OPTIONE/1 would be accessed is, of course, not very substantial, but if LORIPIR feels OPTIONE/1 should receive greater financial assistance to further defray his personal as well as operational costs while in travel status, we suggest that this enabling paragraph be amended to permit greater flexibility in the establishment of the per diem amount. Now would be an appropriate time to amend the MOC to give Chief, LORIFIT/ London, the authority to set OPTIONE/1's per diem at "...$20 to $30 per day during periods of authorized travel, amount to be set in advance by Chief, LORIFIR/London." Fifteen per cent will, of course, still need to be deducted from OPTIONE/1's accounting for every meal he correctly claims as an operational expense. As to travel which does not extend overnight, regulations only require that 50% be deducted from his per diem, rather than the 60% which, in effect, the $10.00 represents. We leave it up to you as to which provision you wish included in the final MOC, but in any event we suggest that it be incorporated in the body of the paragraph, rather than set apart as a quotation from another document.

2. We have no further comments concerning the remainder of the MOC.

3. If you concur with the above suggestions, please resubmit an amended MOC which would also reflect these additional changes. We are sorry not to have been able to meet LORIFIT's 15 October requested deadline, but press of business related to OPPOLADY mission intervened.

26 September 1967

ORPURE/QREBONY/1 Relationship

1. This will confirm our conversation of 18 September 1967, in which we discussed QREBONY/1's plan to visit CRPURE some time during the week of 25 September 1967, and you agreed to give CRPURE/2 prior warning of this visit. In accordance with the same conversation CREBONY/1 was briefed that his visit should be mainly a question of touching base with ORPURE, maybe a friendly luncheon with CORPURE/2 -- but that no substantive discussions affecting their ostensible relationship (i.e., amount of money, amount of QREBONY/1 production for ORPURE, etc.) were to take place. You were to brief GRPURE/2 along the same lines, and also to indicate to him that, contrary to our original thinking, we would now like to have QREBONY/1 given a by-line, whenever ORPURE/2 feels he can do so.

2. In addition to the above, we would appreciate it if you would take up with QRPURE/2 (and/or ORPURE/1, as appropriate) the possibility of increasing the amount of money funded to CREBONY/1 via ORPURE. As indicated to you, we would like to increase the current $100.00 monthly to $300.00 monthly, but would like your careful examination with QRPURE principal(s) that this amount is not excessive either in terms of their willingness to handle or in terms of ORPURE's ostensible ability to cover.

3. Please also mention to CRPURE/2 our desire to have QREBONY/1 open a small office in London, and our thought of perhaps including QRPURE (along with other publications) as a name on the door or on his letterhead. Would QRPURE/2 (or CRPURE/1) have any objections? Would he have any objections if any of the other names are of more radical publications? It would not be operationally feasible or desirable to let him know in advance which these would be, but since both

QRPURE's have been briefed carefully as to QREBONY/1's radical aura, presumably they would have a good idea as to the kind of publications these might be.

4. For operational reasons, we would prefer that the arrangements indicated in paras 2 and 3 above not be broached until after OREBONY/l's departure from the United States, some time in mid-October. We will advise you of his departure so that you can make the necessary arrangements thereafter at your convenience.

MARKED FOR DEDEXING
NO RDENING REQUIRED
ONELY QUALIFIED DESK CAN JAGE CA
MICROFILM

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1.  GREBONY/1 was recruited by WOFACT on 3 June 1965. This recruitment was performed by an officer fron WOMUSE/ICG since GREBONY/1 (then known as STEBONY/1) was viewed as a "double agent" penetration of pro-Chinese communist groups. CREBONY/1 has per- formed well in a difficult and dangerous environment. He is a clandestine agent operating against targets violently anti-WOLADY and of priority interest. The administration of CREDOST/1 requires special care since, by the very nature of his role, he is not typical of the average LCPIPIT asset.

2.  CREBONY/1's initial employment was by Letter of Agreement for a period of three months. This letter of Agreement expired 1 September 1965 and was replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Commitment dated the same day. This oral employment agreement remains in effect at this date--sowe two years later-, but has been amended to adjust compensation. Certain inaccuracies in the original MOC have also been corrected subsequent to its preparation. Given the sensitive nature of GREBONY/1's relationship with WOFACT it is sometimes difficult to adapt the operational realities of his situation to the administrative requirements of WOFACT. However, with great understanding at home and in the field, we have reached a very manageable situation.

3.  In order to codify the entitlements and procedures applicable to QREBONY/l's employment the undersigned has prepared the attached revision of the HOC padershich CREBONY/1 is employed. It is requested that BS approve this revised MOC and notify LCPIPIT of approval by 15 October.

## REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT
(Revised to include all changes and amendments operative as of 14 September 1967)

1. QREBONY/1 is employed by WOFACT as an independent contractor for certain services of a confidential nature. He has received an Operational Approval, dated. Financial aspects of his activity are charged to Project QREBONY.

2. CREBONY/1's employment under this agreement commenced 1 September 1965 and continues on a month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on 30-day notice.

3. OREBONY/1 receives the following financial entitlements:

a. Compensation so computed as to give QREBONY/1 a "tax-free" figure of $800 per month (this figure effective 1 July 1967). NOTE: The actual breakdown of OREBONY/1's finances as carried on WOPACT books is $700 monthly salary; $100 non-accountable operational allowance; $70 tax supplement withheld at HQS to discharge QREBONY/1's WOLADY tax obligation. These taxes are remitted through the Covert Tax Committee.

b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel, unless these are reimbursed by other sources in which case WOPACT will offset such outside reimbursement against WOPACT financial obligations to QREBONY/1. Since security considerations generally preclude the detailed accounting for miscellaneous travel expenses, per diem will be paid at the rate of $20 per day during periods of authorized travel. This per diem authorization was qualified by a personal ruling of Chief of Station, Paris/LCPIPIT dated 12 July 1965:

"If subject is absent from his home station on authorized travel for part of one day and returns to his home station the night of the dame day (i.e. if no hotel expense is involved in the sense of overnight accommodations), then he shall be entitled to draw 1/2 of his authorized per diem of $20 per day (i.e. $10)."

NOTE: OREBONY/1 has a revolving fund (advance) to assist in meeting operational and travel expenses.

4. QREBONY/1 will be compensated by WOFACT in an amount mutually agreed upon for the relocation of himself and his family to a new residence if such relocation is considered desirable by him and WOFACT. NOTE: This provision was included in QREBONY/1's original Letter of Agreement and was retained in this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for CREBONY/1 to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.

5. LCPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by QREBONY/1 of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non- accountable and which shall be charged against the operational expenses category of the budget attached to the FY 1968 project renewal.

6. QREBONY/1 signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true name) at the time of his original recruitment. He is aware that its provisions are still in effect.

7. QREBONY/1 is aware of all provisions of this Memorandum of Oral Commitment with the exception of paragraph 5, which describes an internal WOFACT procedure, and certain aspects of paragraph 3b, specifically that WOPACT is paying LNPORT taxes in his behalf. NOTE: He was promised tax-free compensation in his original recruitment and we have devised the current procedure to honor this commitment while fulfilling the require- ment that all WOLADY citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.

1. LCPIPIT is revising the QREBONY Project files--which have been rather haphazardly maintained over the past year or so (much of this time the project was without a case officer). In our attempts to locate basic project documents we have been unable to find any copy of the provisions of the Operational Approval applicable to QREBONY/1. We do have a copy of the Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW 1591, 7 July 1966. Possibly the relevant document was destroyed during the reduction of files attendant upon the LCPIPIT move, or possibly it was inadvertantly not forwarded to LCPIPIT. At any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy.

2. We would also like to have a sterile version of the FY 68 Project Renewal as well as all other basic documents which ought to be available to LCPIPIT.

We are forwarding USC a copy of a letter sent QREBONY/1 by Jacques Verges' lawyer in which he makes a settlement offer on behalf of his client. CREBONY/1 will probably accept this, after a suitable waiting period, as it offers very telling and effective ammunition for use in his continuing battle to counter Verges' allegation that he was a WOFACT agent. It is our reading at this point that QREBONY/1 has been quite successful in this effort and that this settlement from Verges will be the final triumph in his campaign.

ASE. GIDSON/ VG

Chers Madame et Monsieur,

Je m'empresse de vous faire savoir que Maître
VERGES propose de vous régler en dinars algeriens la moitié
des sommes demandées, ce qui me semble intéressant pour vous,
compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstance; de cette affaire,
soit :

7.500 fr pour M. GIBSON d'une part,et
5.250 pour Mme GIRSON d'autre part
total : 12.7 0 fr

Je dois vous indiquer que cette proposition est
un peu inespérée, car il est clair qu'en poursuivant la Société
des NOUVELLES EDITIONS INTERNATIONALES, vous gagnerez une cer-
taine some dont je ne puis fixer ie montant, mais ne toucherez
jamais rien.

En ce qui concerne la lettre dont M. GIBSON
m'avait entretenu, mon Confrère ne me répond/sur celle-ci.
Je pense qu'il n'y a quand ême pas lieu d'en faire une question
de principe et que nous pourrious, dans le cadre d'un reçu, ob-
tenir une phrase drreebe sur ce qui a été dit à votre sujet.

En tout état de cause et si nous parvenions à un
accord sur cette base, Me VERGES propose de tenir cette somme à
votre disposition dès votre premier voyage en Algérie.

Je crois qu'il serait préférable que, d'une manièr
ou d'une autre, cette somme soit remise à une personne ayant votre
confiance.

Si toutefois vous pensez que je dois tenter d'ob-
tenir un peu plus, vous voudrez bien je vous prie me le faire
savoir, mais j'insiste sur ce point qu'il est quelqe fois préfé-
rable d'attraper une proposition à la balle! plutôt que de ris-
quer de tout perdre. CS COPY

# CONTINUING BRITISH IMMIGRATION PROBLEM

Returning to London from Stockholm on 10 July, I was again queried by British immigration about my failure to register as a permanent resident. My excuse has always been that I did in fact go to the Home Office, but no action was ever taken because I rarely remained in the country more than a month. However, this tale is wearing thin and I fear that I may have much more serious trouble in the near future.

It would seem to me that the best solution might be to become the official London correspondent of KPI or any other outfit that might have me. I would need a letter to that effect and would require a notional salary of about $5,000 per year, I believe, but even this might raise questions from the British Inland Revenue.

Some advice on this problem would be appreciated.

* Must be at least £ 1000 yearly.

## NEGRO, IN PEKING, ACCUSES CUBANS

*Vicious Smear* of China in *'Forged' Letter Charged*

Robert F. Williams, an American Negro who is now a black rationalist spokesman in Peking, has charged that the Cuban regime of Premier Fidel Castro has counterfeited a newsletter he puts out and used the bogus periodical for "a vicious smear attack" on Communist China.

In the May issue of the newsletter, The Crusader, which has arrived here, Mr. Williams asserted that the "forged" version "carries a metered postmark that is available only for Cuban Government bulk mailing." He charged that the newsletter was put out by "the Cuban G-2", which he said was heavily infiltrated by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.

Mr. Williams left his home in Monroe, N. C., in 1951 and went to Cuba, where he advocated a "freedom struggle".

Negroes in the United States. He left Cuba last year.

Another American Negro nationalist, Richard Gibson, in a current newsletter from London, describes Mr. Williams as "chairman-in-exile of the All-Black Revolutionary Action Movement (BAM) in the United States." Sixteen persons, who were said to be members of the revolutionary movement, were arrested in Queens last month on charges of having plotted to murder moderate Negro civil rights leaders.

The Crusader that Mr. Williams contended was mailed from Havana last month, has a headline, "China Betrays The Cuban Revolution," and has Mr. Williams saying that he was "deceived by the soft lies and subtle flattery of Chinese Communist leaders. It goes on to say that Mao Tse-tung was now "old and sick and can no longer control his arrogant, power-mad underlings who, although acting in his name, have abandoned the people's revolution."

Mr. Williams' current Peking newsletter asserted that "Afro-Americans should refuse to fight" in Vietnam. But it added that "those who are trapped into it" could "work among the troops to educate them to the true facts of life."

As advice to Negroes at home, the newsletter said:

"Revolutionaries must play it in a cool. Infiltrate the police and the master infiltrators, the C.I.A. We must learn to subvert him at his own expense while using his facilities to advance the cause of Black liberation."

On Monday, Workers World, a weekly here with a Trotskyist tendency, announced that it had obtained a statement from Mr. Williams denouncing the alleged murder plot here as a "frame-up."

"It is not my policy nor RAM's to kill condescending Uncle Toms," the statement said. "We are not an organization advocating pointless assassinations. We are dedicated freedom-fighters stressing Chinese armed self-defense. Our objective is to make America a just and decent place to live."

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

1. We now have JAGUAR's comments on the proposed “roup" designed to allow RFBONY to expand his access by "representing" something even if only a purely notional group. The letter from JAGUAR is attiched.

2. We would observe that JaGUa's comments are obviously made in a constructive vein. Similarly, J.GL/R seems to tate a protective, almost proprietary interest in considerations affecting the EBONY project. We naturally welcome this fcel- ing on their port, since CREBONY continues to exist as : U..- based operation at their pleasure. and we think that J.GUR'S comments are sound, in substance. Their final comment : 150 veils, to say the least, the understandable SEORANGE reluctance to sce yet another splinter group-spevning, with the fright- ful political implications if a FCLODY spy were exposed cale running a phoney "pro-Chinese" group in the U.K.: (It would probably be not too good in OLY, for that matter, Lut: government could fall here as a result.)

3. Ve Lave now had an opportunity to talk this over with CILIBERTI, LAGINESTRA and RODIGAST, sud all are agreed the t CREBONY's trial balloon will not be re-floated. De thi TO baru is done. If JAGUAR should come into possession on copy of REEONY's letter, and ask us about it, we will acknowledge that he wrote it to try out on a limited number of friends and aimed at his Swedish audience, preliminary to (he hopcc) 1.00 BILLIANS' arrival in Sweden. Fe are now serely replying to JAGUAR that we are grateful for their cogent comments, and that "the group" will not be activated unless there is a significant change in the (REBONY operational situation such as to recuire "the group" to be crested, in which case we will again seek their concurrence.

TO: C/JOVIEW

FROM: COS/London, C/WOMUSE, C/Fur Div

SUBJECT: CTDOPIC/Operational CREBONY/GREGORY/1 and AMSQUAW/1's Relationship

1.  The relationship between CREBONY/1 and AMSQUAW/1 is a particularly important one from both the production and security points of view. AMSQUAW/1 has been a prolific and reliable reporter, especially on items dealing with the International War Crimes Tribunal, and it will be highly desirable for her to continue to serve in this capacity in the forseeable future. It is recognized that AMSQUAW/1 is not a controlled agent and that her personal willingness to serve as a clandestine informant of CREBONY/1 is based upon a complex and inter-related series of reasons, both personal and ideological. CREBONY/1 helped her out of a tight situation in Africa and has befriended her since her arrival in London. For the last several months she has been living at his house. CREBONY/1 has a very agreeable personality and is a genuinely likeable person. At the same time, although she is not an ideological person, she shares his pro-Chinese ideological position and she has never questioned his explanation - that her reporting is for the Chinese. Lastly, we cannot and have not, overlooked the likelihood of a physical attraction between the two. In the last analysis it is impossible for us to state exactly what motivates her to act as a clandestine informant for CREBONY/1.

2.  It is quite possible for the relationship between CREBONY/1 and AMSQUAW/1 to change at any time. Should their relationship take a turn for the worst it might possibly have adverse security implications for CREBONY/1. This subject has been discussed at length with CREBONY/1 and he agrees that great care must be taken. He is careful to use AMSQUAW/1 only in situations where it would be plausible for the Chinese to have an interest. Thus far this has been relatively easy, indeed at the Stockholm sessions of the Russell Tribunal the absence of any Chinese representatives served to confirm in AMSQUAW/1's mind that CREBONY/1 was the Chinese man on the scene. At this point no actual problem exists, but both LCPIPIT and CREBONY/1 are alert to the possibility that one could arise.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: CILIBERTI Conversation with RNSLIVER 26 April Concerning His Meeting with QREBONY/1

1. On 25 April BASTEAR told me that RUSLIVER was in London and was planning to meet with QREBONY/1. BASTEAR accordingly suggested that RASLIVER be debriefed by the undersigned the following morning. Accordingly I met with PNSLIVER for about one hour, from which meeting the following highlights seen worth recording:

A. I told RNSLIVER that we (WOFACT) had been interested in QREBONY/1 at the time that he was writing for China Quarterly concerning his dispute with the editor of Revolution, Jacque Verges, but that we had lost tract of him of late. Yow that we are in QREBONY/1's home town, RYSLIVER was told that we and Headquarters would be interested in any information on QREBONY/1 which could be reported as a result of such meetings as RNSLIVER had had with him.

B. RNSLIVER said that he had told Leo Labeds that he would like to meet Ibrahim to gain some understanding of what was going on in the African exiled community, particularly as it related to the Sino-Soviet split. Labedz said that he thought that FNSLIVER would do much better by talking to QREBONY/1 whom he, Labedz, said was one of the few people around from whoa Labedz could learn anything.

C. PUSLIVER met OREBONY/1 at QREBONY/l's house. RNSLIVER did not have a complete roster of those who were there to participate in what RNSLIVER described as a "political bull session". He remembered only (in addition to himself and OREBONY/1) of Matthew Mkoana and a girl from Mexico City named Sucesos, who he said knew a great deal about guerrilla poings-on in Venezuela and whose address he said was Calzada, Tacuboya 103, Mexico 18. RNSLIVER said that Nkoana said practically nothing throughout the evening, apparently because he found RNSLIVER's presence odd and unnerving.

D. RHSLIVER was as impressed with OREBONY/1 as Labeda had predicted he would be. He described QREBONY/1 as remarkably knowl-edgeable concerning Chinese factions of Communist movements in Western Europe and Africa. He said that OREBONY/1 had described his recent trip to Nicosia and Cairo, had sentioned that he had visited Dar-es-Salaam, that he knew Jacques Grippa, and that he Intended to visit Stockholm in connection with the Pussell Tribunal and a possible Stockholm visit by Robert Williams.

E. RNSLIVER was particularly impressed by QREBONY/1's library of radical books and pamphlets. RISLIVER turned over to the undersigned for copying and return a recent issue of Williams' The Crusader, and a copy of QREBONY/1's own newsletter. These were received with feigned interest, although of course we had earlier received the same items from RODIGAST (already forwarded to Headquarters).

F. RNSLIVER did not recall meeting Mrs. QREBONY/1, and did not know how many children QREBONY/1 had. He described QREBONY/1's house as attractively middle class. He was aware of the fact that QREBONY/1 had gone to Kenyon College and praised OREBONY/1's writing skills. QREBONY/1 showed him a number of articles he had written which RNSLIVER said completely followed the Chinese Communist line. RNSLIVER was surprised that some of these articles had been printed in the United States in spite of their political orientation.

# GRIFFITH VISIT

Conversation with prof. Willian S. Griffith, London, 25/4/67.

Tadeusz Horto phoned my home to tell me that XKKKXX Griffith, who is spending a sabbatical year in Hurich from HIT, wanted to see me. Later that evering, Leo Labeidz and Griffith arrived. Stella Joyce of Amnesty International and Matthew Lkoana also arrived unexpectedly. It turned out that Lebedz and Joyce had often talked over thepkakex the phone, but had never met.

Griffith told me that he had recently visited East africa. In Dar es Salaam, he had met David Sikeko and Ansed G. Ebrahin of the PAC (Pan Africanist Congress). He said his distinct impression was that PAC was on a strong pro-Chinese course. Griffith said he had written to hana Manoco's old address in London in an effort to contact him, but had learned later that ahozo was now at Kaki Kirkland House, Harvard University. He said he looked forward to talking with Halomo when he went briefly to the USA in liay.

As HQS is aware, QREBONY/1 has been pursuing a legal action against Jacques Verges. He has now received a letter from his lawyer which seems to indicate that Verges is willing to make some sort of settlement—although he can only pay in Algerian dinars. QREBONY/1, of course, is willing to accept a settlement provided it includes some sort of apology from Verges. Armed with this apology QREBONY/1 could then dispose of any lingering doubts regarding his political reliability caused by Verges' accusations and would also have the ego gratification of forcing Verges to eat his own words.

Mon confrère adverse, Conseil de la Société Nouvelle

savoir qu'il a eu une conversation avec de VERGES qui lui a
indiqué qu'il vit actuellement en Algérie et serait disposé
à rechercher un règlement amiable des difficultés qui vous

Il m'a fait part qu'actuellement sa situation ne

Il y a là une question de principe. Pourriez-vous,
je vous prie, me faire savoir si vous pourriez envisager une

J'ignore d'ailleurs dans quelles conditions l'exportation aes

I phoned Schwartzenberg and informed him I would agree
to a settlement, but the accurs to be raid in any currency
would necessamly depend on the extent to which Jacques
Verges apolcazed for his accusations against ze iz 1964.
I said I not mind if Verges attempted to lay the blame
for those cccccations on a "Lisunderstanding" or on erroneous
or calicious cisinformation given him by others.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

1. QREBONY/1 told RODIGAST at their most recent meeting that he did not have to file an overt tax form for 1966 because his gross overt income for 1966 was less than $600. This will not be true for the 1967 tax year and he will have to file in the Spring of 1968. The operative sentence in the 1966 Tax Guide For US Citizens Abroad, US Treasury Dest IP3 Pub No 54 states--"Every citizen of the United States, regardless of where he resides who is under 65 years of age and has a gross income of $600 or more during a tax year must file an income tax return."

2. For the record the undersigned who is as yet unfamiliar with all administrative details, would appreciate HQS confirmation of the above.

URGENT

ERITISH IMMIGRATION PROBLEM:

Returning to the U.S. on 15/3/67, I was warned by British Immigration at London Airport that I was spending more time in Britain than outside the country. The Immigration Officer inspected my passport closely, counting the number of trips I had made since getting that passport, which had been issued by the U.S. Embassy in London, on 1 December 1965. However, no explanation was asked for concerning the travel. I explained that I had intended to resettle in Switzerland or France, and was spending so much time in Britain only because my wife, who was British, had been helping to take care of her elderly parents in London. I was told nevertheless that I should go to the Home Office and apply for temporary residence in Britain.

Before doing so, I would need to know:

1) whether I should in fact do so;

2) how should I describe my work, if any, and source of income.

At present, upon investigation, the British would learn that I have no visible means of income, except for perhaps for my Reports and some freelance journalism, but nevertheless receive money regularly from a Swiss bank account.

If I told the Home Office, I was a freelance journalist, I imagine they would demand some sort of bank or other financial statements, which would probably be examined by British tax authorities for possible taxation. Even if I say I have no employment of any consequence and maintain myself on income from investments made in Switzerland and elsewhere, I might have to verify that statement and pay some sort of British taxes. Considering the positions of my brothers-in-law, I doubt if either could get away with claiming to fully or partially support my family, and my brother-in-law Gordon Kaye, who is a Chartered Accountant, has been deducting my children's school fees from his taxes by means of an educational trust fund, although he no longer pays anything towards the fees. I could say that I was the beneficiary of a tax-free U.S. fellowship, but this might prove more cumbersome and dangerous than necessary, in the present circumstances.

In any case, I need advice on this matter urgently, as I suspect I may soon have to visit from the Home Office if I do not go to them voluntarily.

SUBJECT: DTDORIC/QREBONY/Operational QREBONY/1 Mentioned in Senate Hearings

ACTION REQUIRED: REFERENCES

See paragraph 4.

1. Transmitted under separate cover is an excerpt from a recent Senate debriefing of a PBRUMEN defector, in which QREBONY/1's name was mentioned.

2. We do not believe that the testimony is particularly awkward for QREBONY/1, and while we had an opportunity to have this portion of the testimony stricken from the record, we elected not to do anything about it since it would have involved revealing WOFACT interest in QREBONY/L

3. FYI, In order to avoid any concern on the part of QRPURE should this portion of the testimony ever hit the press, KAMMERMAYER mentioned the reference to CREBONY/1 in low key to QRPURE at a recent meeting. QRPURE exhibited no concern.

4. Please have RODIGAST brief QREBONY/l concerning the testimony at an early opportunity.

Mr. Sourwine. Now, did you have any information about the presence in London of any other United States citizens who had attempted to obtain a visa to travel to Cuba?

Mr. Volta. Yes.

Mr. Sourwine. Tell us about this.

Mr. Volta. There was a newspaper man, a colored man.

Mr. Sourwine. A Negro?

Mr. Volta. Yes, a Negro. And he used to be, I think, president of Fair Play for Cuba here in the States, I think in New York. I don't know if this was in New York. And he visited the Embassy, trying to get a visa.

Mr. Sourwine. The Cuban Embassy in London?

Mr. Volta. Yes, the Cuban Embassy in London.

1 FEB 1966

TO:
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. E. J. Papich

FROM: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: SUGAR's Involvement with American Radical Organizations

1. This memorandum requests your Agency's comments, on a priority basis, relative to improving the operational capabilities of SUGAR, a source of this Agency known to you, whose reporting on expatriate American leftist personalities we are forwarding on a continuing basis.

2. Despite our hopes and his efforts, SUGAR was unable to obtain an invitation to the Tri-Continental Conference recently held in Havana, which was a target for collection by this Agency. It is our belief that SUGAR's reputation of being pro-Chinese was responsible for his exclusion. In discussing this problem with important pro-Chinese communist personalities in Europe recently, the latter suggested that his ability to secure access to such meetings would be considerably enhanced if he could obtain a "grass-roots" base or connection in the United States which he could represent. In reporting this suggestion--which strikes us as valid--SUGAR speculated on the possibility that he might attempt to become the European "representative" of the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), an American organization of which he knows little but which seems, from what he does know, to be consistent in its outlook with his ostensible political orientation.

3. In this connection, we would very much appreciate receiving any information you possess on RAM, its structure, personalities and membership. We would welcome particularly, any mailing list or address roster of this organization which might be passed on to SUGAR without compromise to security considerations.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

SECRET

4. Most of all, we would welcome your comments on this general problem, given your Agency's broad knowledge of such organizations as LAM in this country. As a negro expatriate with pretended pro-Chicom sympathies, SUGAR has also cultivated a reputation for sympathy toward the admittedly vague and diverse manifestations of "black nationalism", and toward such personalities as Robert Williams who embody it. We would be most interested in receiving both your comments on this general movement of opinion in the United States, and your descriptions of the organizations associated with it which could enable us to provide information and guidance to SUGAR for developing an association which would increase his operational access and effectiveness.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/OA

ATTENTION: Mr. John Brever

SUBJECT: Field Investigation of QREBONY; Grebony Clearance. (201-306052).

1. Pursuant to our conversation of 11 February in your office, this memorandum requests that the usual field background investigation not be undertaken in the clearance process instituted for QREBONY.

2. We make this request for limitation because of our strong belief that such an investigation vould rum an unacceptably high risk--approaching certainty--of causing serious damage to QREBONY's reputation and therefore his effectiveness with the targets against which he is directed as an inforvent. In the past, both here and abroad, QREBONY has made varm enemics, as well as friends, amang dissident end leftist circles. He has particularly alionated both U.S. Comsamist and Trotskyist elements, apparently by his dealings with them while serving as Executive Director of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the early 60's. His reputation for pro-Chicca sympathies--which is the basis of his present operational usefulness to us as a source-constitutes an additional grievance spinst him by such parties as the CPUSA and the CPOB which are pro-Moscow and anti-Peking. We know from independent sources as vell as from his own testimony, that such hostility has taken the form of, charges-completely false at the tine--that he was an ODENVY or KUBARK agent. (Apparently a favored mear technique in such circless this charge has been Leveled in other cases with equal lack of justification.) These allegations against QREMONY have not prevented him from winaing the apparent confidence of many leftist target clements who, if they are amare of then at all, no doubt realise the prevalence of such backbiting and gossip and who have not been prevented from developing personal and confidential relations with him. Each charges, however, do represent a dormant vulnerability: they have made Bubject something of a controversial figure in a millieu which rightly feels itself a target for intelligence collection and is extremely sensitive to the dangurs of penetration.

# SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

3. Against the background of this vulnerability, it must also be stressed that the sources to be contacted by such a field investigation would include many individuals whose suspicions of government interest-and hostility toward it-ve could not reasonably expect to disarm. CREBONY's career in the United States in FPCC and similar groups put him in contact with a wide range of individuals who are not merely sophisticated but highly sensitive concerning any such inquiry. It is not possible to conceive of any method of approach thich would not provoke their suspicions that a government connection with QREBONY vas involved. (It is, moreover, hardly likely that cooperation could be expected of any of them, except in such cases where the individual sensed an opportunity to record damaging information.) In view of what we know about the rapid circulation of gossip among such individuals, and their great interest in, and suspicions of government interest, such an inquiry could be calculated with reasonable confidence to spell the end of any effectiveness CREBONY could offer this Agancy.

4. While we realise fully that the aim of such an inquiry is to resolve unknowns in an individual's background and develop materials beyond those presently available, ve note that QREBONY has been a subject of continuing interest to ODEVY for my years, and that, as a result, the basic politically derogatory associations in his past are a matter of record. As you know, a successful polygraph was perforsed on him indicating the absence of IS connection beyond such associations, and confirming (to the extent that it can be said to do so) his assertions of loyalty despite them.

5. In requesting clearance in this case, we are seeking to exploit QREBONY's ability to report information to us which he receives in the course of his contacts vith national liberation leaders, pro-Chinese commists and similar personalities. Such information represents general political and biographical material relative to the interests, activities and plans of such individuals. Requirements passed to him in this commection involve instructions for the refinement and coupleteness of the reporting he is capable of providing from his normal intercourse with souros personalities. It is anticipated that his usefulness will be increased by travel to those areas where his access to targets known to him permits firsthand reporting. It is also anticipated that he may be able to serve selected CA purposes by surfacing information available to him, when this does not prejudice his cover status.

Kis use is understood to be, and has been, limited and precludes revelation of classified information, either by operational assignments supporting or servicing other KUBARK operations, witting participation in the recruitment of other agents, or the passing of such requirements as vould reveal a classified status of KUBARK knowledge or interest in any collection target.

(Los datos sobre la vida y curricula de estos señores anteriores a su visita a Cuba deberán encontrarse en otra parte.)

Bob es el mejor del grupo, casi el único que realmente vale. Hombre gran valor personal y un buen periodista, estuvo en la Sierra en 1957 y de nuevo en 1958, donde entrevistó y filmó una película para la CES, de Fidel Castro y sus guerrilleros. Al triunfo de la Revolución, estuvo en Cuba de visita varias veces y fue luego uno de los fundadores del Fair Play Committee For Cuba. Aparentemente, perdió su puesto en CES y se enajenó el amor de su esposa (de esto se quejaba a menudo en Cuba) por causa de la Revolución Cubana. Amigo personal de Raúl Roa y Gómez Wanguemert y también de Fidel Castro, según parecía en 1961. Con relaciones personales con Manuel Piñeiro (de quien se reía de sus infu-les de policía) y Ramiro Valdés y Raúl Castro, aunque nunca pareció estimarlos mucho. Este sentimiento parecía recíproco. Gran enemistad hacia los miembros del PSP y enemistad de ellos hacia Teber, sobre todo de Aníbal Escalante y Joaquín Ordoqui y Carlos Rafael Rodríguez. Una de las tragedias en la vida de Bob Tater fue el darse cuenta de que se había malquistado con Fidel Castro por hacerle, personalmente y cada vez que lo veía, críticas públicas. Fue entonces (a fines de 1960 y principios de 1961) que comenzaron verdaderamente sus problemas y que comprendió que no solamente había perdido el favor de sus amigos, sino que estaba en desgracia con sus enemigos. Fue esto, sin duda, lo que le hizo buscar la muerte en Playa Girón, mientras actuaba como corresponsal del periódico Revolución. Fue gravemente herido en un muslo y salvó la vida por pura suerte. Antes había renunciado a su pasaporte o había sostenido una polémica pública con periodistas o senadores norteamericanos, desde las páginas del "El Mundo", donde colaboraba. En Cuba por poco muere también, poco después, de una infección contraída en Guatemala, en los días de la revolución contra Arbenz. A fines de 1961 salió de Cuba con un documento (ni siquiera pudieron darle un pasaporte cubano, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores ya en manos totalmente de los comunistas) personal de identidad, tratando de ir a China como corresponsal, pero en Praga le negaron el permiso para visitar este país y la URSS. Pasó a Francia y luego a Londres -y de ahí regresó a USA vía Canadá.

Teber no es un comunista ni parece haberlo sido nunca. Es un romántico político y un hombre ingenuo, que creyó que la *evolución cubana*, de alguna manera, encarnaba algo de los ideales de Jefferson y Lincoln, asombrosamente. Hoy sabe que nada hay que esperar del comunismo en general y de la Revolución Cubana en particular.

## 2. Robert Taber (continue)

En la actualidad mantiene lazos de amistad en Cuba con Crlos Franqui, Juan Arcocha y Gomez Wanguemert, ya que una de las características de Robert Faber es su sentido del agradecimiento. Es uno de los hombres que mejor conocen en USA la Revolución Cubana, sus motivaciones, sus verdaderas intenciones, sus intenciones enmascaradas, eus logros reales y falsos y sus verdaderos fracasos. Políticamente, por sus certes, parece ser alguien que regresa a un socialismo ingenuo y primitivo, lo Oven y Proudhon y aborrece el cinismo comunista de que el fin justifice los medios.

En Cuba, en 1961, relizó un acto de gran coraje intelectual, poco después del coraje físico en Playa Girón, el ser el único periodista (siendo extrehjero, además) que defendió el fila "P.M.", que prohibieren Alfredo Güevera y el ICAIC y que originara la gran, prizers purga de intelectuales de izquierda y fueran el pretexto para las llamadas Conversaciones de la Bibliotece Nacional y el famoso discurso de Fidel Castro los intelectuales, tan citedò dondequiere. El artículo de Tater fue aceptado por la dirección del periódico El Mundo, pero no fue publicado--sunque Fidel Castro conociera su contenido al ser leído públicamente en una de las sesiones de la Bibliotece. Este gesto apresuré su salidade Cuta y selló su suerte polítice.

Es el menos conocido de los cuatro y quizás el más peligroso, porque es el más estable cnocionalmente, el más meilocre y más trabajador del grupo. Fue Cuta en 1961, recomendado por Richard Gibson y el Pair Play Committee, pero también por su cuente. Se hospedó en el Havene Riviere, no sin dificultades, pues sus puntos de vista, nada similables por los comunistes cutanos, fieles perritos de Morcú, le trajeron el odio del PSP y una --ligera acusación-de posible agente del FEI infiltrado en el Movimiento Negro y en Cuba. Hakl poco con él y solamente recuerdo su extraño ecento, tal vez de Chicago o simplemente algún defecto en tómico, su especto de metodiste negro y los shorts de cuero de elphista italiano que siempre usaba en el hotel. Luego se hizo femoso en Cuba y en Curopa, cuando fue procesado por haber ião - Cuia ya China Comunista sin permiso v lido.

REF: A. PALP 5033 (IN 96553)

B. OFLA 3128 (18 November 1965)

1. We have discussed the substance of the question raised in Ref B through the regular Headquarters channel with the ODENVY Rop here who has acted as a point of liaison for CREBONY material in the past. Se passed on, also, the materials which you prepared for the CDENVY representative with whom you are in contact in Paris. We raised specifically the question of passing CREBONY's identity to the Paris ODEVY representative, which you mentioned in Rof B, stating that, so far as KUDARK is concerned, we had no objections. The ODENVY representative here, however, thought that this might serve to confuse sono- what the lines of coordination for QREDONY's information, for which ODENVY headquarters has sole responsibility. He there- fore felt that we should continue the prosent arrangement by which, in effect, CREBONY's identity is held here at the point whore his material within ODENVY originates. He appreciated, however, your initiative in filling in the Paris ODENVY representative on the targets which QREBONY can service, thus alerting him to possible leads he might look into. Ho suggests also that we be kept aware of your liaison with ODENVY in the field to guard against false confirmation or other possible duplication which could lead to confusion here in those quarters of ODENVY responsible for processing the QRECONY material.

2. With respect to Freedomways, discussed in Ref A, and Q's possible relationship with it, we will report separately.

# MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

FROM: Harvey G. FAHNRICH

SUBJECT: Security of QREBONY/1 S/W Communications System

REFERENCES: A. OFLA 3044
B. PALP 4385
C. FRAN 5087

1. In early June of this year KUWOLF developmental agent QREBONY/1 (formerly STEBONY/1) was trained by KUWOLF Career Agent Rufus F. RODIGAST in the use of the S/W system prescribed by HKTOPAZ per Reference C. QREBONY/1 took one carbon sheet of the system with him on a brief trip to North Africa and used it for four messages in the latter part of June. Concurrently, Paris Station TECHS, on LCPIPIT's behalf, requested in OFPT 10348 that HKTOPAZ prepare for QREBONY/1's use an S/W carbon pad which would alleviate the carbon concealment problem for the agent. The pad was received subsequently and passed to QREBONY/1 on 18 July 1965, at which time his original single carbon sheet was withdraw.

2. QREBONY/1 first used his new S/W pad for a message dated 22 July 1965, comments on which were transmitted to interested KUBARK Headquarters and Field components in Reference B. QREBONY/1 underwent a corrective briefing on the use of his pad on 4 August 1965, carbon No. 1 (rearmost of three in the back of his pad) was withdrawn since it bore an imprint of the 22 July message, and QREBONY/1 was authorized to use carbon No. 2 (middle of three) but only for "essential" messages. (a 24 July S/H message was also critiqued at the 4 August meeting-because the carbon impression was relatively weak.)

3. On the basis of LCPIPIT's instruction to refrain from using his S/W pad except for "essential" messages, QREBONY/1 did not employ it again until 11 October 1965. The nature of the message indeed met the criteria for use of the pad, but as in the 22 July letter the message was clearly legible without development. To quote Paris Station TECHS:

"SW impressions were clearly visible under Ultraviolet Light (short wave and long wave) and also under a plain desk light."

On the basis of this report, QREBONY/1's previous performance in use of the pad, and the fact that the next point from which he was to use the pad would be Algiers, LCPIPIT determined that the risk of compromise outweighed the necessity of QREBONY/1 carrying this communications system with him and withdrew the S/W pad on 20 October 1965. LCPIPIT retains possession of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 125

2

the pad which contains the two remaining carbon sheets (No. 2 detached and
inserted in the back of the pad, No. 3 still bound in the pad.) The 11 October
massage is clearly legible to the naked eye on carbon No. 2.

4. Of greater concern to LCPIPIT, however, were the folloring
   additional comments of Paris Station TECHS regarding the 11 October messages:

> "The envelope you sent has evidence of tampering. There was glua
> bleeding plus fiber tears. Plus, additional glue had been added
> to the upper flap (glus must have run and was sticking inside on
> the letter.)"

5. In the 20 October meeting at which his S/W pad was withdrawn
   QREBONY/1 stated that he had written the 11 October message on a sheet of glass,
   perhaps with a pencil that was too soft. He conceded that there was some imprint
   on the carbon, but nothing which could be read on the actual message sheet. He
   said he wrote the message at 1100 hours when he was alone at his home and burned
   the remainder of the message stack immediately. He said he then put the message
   in an envelope immediately and sealed it gently under another sheet of paper to
   avoid rubbing it. He added that he then placed the proper postage on the envelope,
   placed it in his pocket, and mailed it two hours later at the closest mailbox
   to him home. QREBONY/1 asserted that he did not reopen the letter after sealing
   and was certain that his wife had not seen it.

6. Pursuant to LCPIPIT's exploration of this question with QREBONY/1
   we sent an informal note to MKTOPAZ via a Paris Station Officer on 20 October
   1965 requesting assistance in efforts to determine whether QREBONY/l's
   correspondence was indeed subject to tampering. MKTOPAZ prepared five "booby-
   trapped" envelopes for our use. Two of these were mailed to the LCPIPIT letter
   drop from two different cities on the continent, and the remaining three were
   passed to QREBONY/1 on 5 November for him to mail from his home.

7. The five "boody-trapped" envelopes were picked up at the LCPIPIT
   letter drop over a period of a week and were handcarried by a Paris Station Officer
   to Frankfurt on 18 November for processing by HKTOPAZ. Paris/LCPIPIT asked the
   opinion of MKTOPAZ on the following points:

a) Was there evidence of tampering with any of the five envelopes?
b) If so, which envelopes bore evidence of tampering?
c) Was it possible to determine from a study of the cachets whether
such tampering occurred before or after the cachets were applied?
d) Did such tampering appear to be of a professional or of
amateur nature?
e) Any other HKTOPAZ observations which would help LCPIPIT determina
the source of any tampering that may have taken place.

8. ΜΚΤΟΡΑZ advised LCPIPIT on 19 November via FRAN 9240 that there
   vas Bo evidence of tampering on the five booby-trapped letters."

Report Q REBONY/1: Security Aspects

In reply to the attached (Memo on Home Situation) Rodigest told QREBCNY/1:

1. We can't do anything about his housing problem in view of non-permanent nature of our present arrangement.

2. Avoid formalizing periodical at this point; it should require no authorizations for publication as it is merely a news correspondent's report, mimeographed for convenience-not a magazine.

3. In order to control content, Q alone should have responsibility for putting out issues-can't delegate to wife and above all to other contacts.

## HOME SITUATION

OFLA 3146/1

My wife was rather hostile to my news about my contacts with the Chinese comrades. She said she was sorry I couldn't work something out with metropolitan Features. I hadn't done enough work for them because i was lazy, she said. She said if i weren't careful I'd be treated by the Chinese just what future was there in that? she asked. Anyway, she added, I don't really give a damn about the Chinese.

She pointed out the situation was difficult for us. The landlord in London was trying to evict us and we had no idea where we were going. I had no substantial funds from the Chinese and was still living on the generosity of the Americans (Metropolitan), she said.

Moreover, she was tired of being a grass widow. I was keeping secrets from her, she had been certain for sometime, she said. She had had enough trouble with my "secrets" in the past, she said.

However, she liked the idea of reports, but was sorry about the "objectivity" and the 50 copies only limit. There was no reason, if I could get some help from the Chinese, that I couldn't make a success of the newsletter and really be independent, she said.

I emphasized to her that I had contacted with the Chinese without Hils' knowledge and that she should on no account ever mention the matter with him. She said that showed how the Chinese treated people. nobody was more honest than Hils, she added. What was happening to him now would happen to me one day, she said.

However, she was genuinely pleased with the newsletter and spent some time trying to collect material for the dummy I was preparing. She wrote herself a piece on X.C.A.R.D. (I have the feeling that a lot of her resentment would be dissipated if she would allowed to handle most of the business involved with the newsletter.)

The housing problem remains a serious one and we may have to move. A temporary furnished flat in London would cost us at least £25 to £30 a week today - at present, we pay £12-12-0 per week. We have given the case to a lawyer, but, because it is a furnished flat, we will probably have to get out sometime soon.

The other important question to be settled is that of a mailing address for the Report. Should I get a London mail drop and run the risks of running into the Home Office or should I get a lawyer and set the thing up legally, perhaps under my wife's (British subject) name? In that case, I could take a one-room office somewhere around Fleet St. and my wife could take care of the mail with an occasional office temporary during my absence.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 128

# OFLA 3146/1

I suggest that the report always be mailed out from the same address, London or whereever. My wife will be able to get sufficient copy from various people, such as Pomeroy and Jeanne Pyror [30-year old freelance journalist who specializes in african affairs, now married to a Kenya parásitologist studying in London, formerly worked for Dennis Phombean]. For my purposes, if can obtain press rates, I can wire copy to Lerion to from Havana or Dar es salaam, thus giving tangible evidence of my activities as a bonafide newsman. It would be helpful if I could get an American Cable & Radio System Credit (Transferred Account) Card, such as I got from revolucion in Havana for use at the U.K. in 1961.

Subject: QREBONY/1 - Security at home

18 Nov 65

1.  At his 17 November meeting with Rodigast QREBONY/1 (Q) was
    asked some questions concerning keep of files and correspondence. He keeps
    copies of all correspondence (except routine letters transmitting articles
    he has ritten, for example) in a file to which his wife has access.
    He maintains a minimum of questionable notes, and keeps his personal
    notebook (with addresses, expenses, etc.) in his coat pocket day and night.

2.  His wife has two brothers. The one to whom Q owes money is
    Gordon, a chartered accountant, who during World War II was in British
    Military Intelligence. He visits the Q home to tring gifts from the wife's
    mother to the Q children, but has a cat-and-dog relationship with Q's
    wife; indeed, he will not stay for a zeal because he can't stand talking
    to her, and the feeling is mutual. Q is certain she would never think of
    confiding in Gordon, for example to say: "Lock at these awful letters
    Q has written!" Gordon is more likely to confide in Q himself. Gordon's
    politics are apparently solidly conservative. (His wife's other brother,
    less involved with them, works for Pank.)

3.  Q mailed the three test letters as follows: one in the morning,
    the two following on successive aftermoons, at the local box in the normal
    way. One of the three envelopes actually contained a note: a simple
    statement that "William" (Guillermo) had not defected but his brother had
    (Cabrera Infante), information acquired from a Cuban official (see
    separate contact reports).

4.  Q wanted to get a lawyer's opinion on what regulations govern
    publishing a periciical in his country of residence (he is not of course
    officially a resident at all). Sensing additional costs and unnecessary
    formality, Rodigast suggested that he keep it on the basis of being
    a correspondent's reports, not a separate comercial press venture
    requiring eventual licenses of payment of business taxes, at least for
    the time being. Mailed first class, the material should require no permit
    from the mail authorities. A contact had suggested he might have
    difficilty with the locals (see report of Q's 15 November contact with WP).

Because of CHEBOY/1's repeated carelessness in use of his S/W system and the obvious risk inherent in his seeking to use this system from Algeria, LCIPIII with the system from bir at the 30 October meeting. His carbon sheet carried deep impressions that were easily readable by the naked eye. Also, we have, in cooperation with KUSODA/ Paris, taken urgent action on a informal basis (to be followed up by dispatch) to have XTOPAZ prepare a set of envelopes in order that we may run a series of tests on the possibility, as well as the source, of tampering with QEEBONY/1's correspondence to us. A full report on this matter, including its resolution, will be forwarded appropriate addresses as soon as the investigation can be completed.

INFO: Chief, WE; Chief, AF; Chief, KUWOLF; Chief, LCPIPIT

FROM: Chief of Station, London

SUBJECT: STEBONY QRPPREY JAGUAR JAGUAR Report on STEBONY/1

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:

Ref: A OELA 43,522, 2 July 1965
B OELA 43,802, 11 August 1965

1. The following is the text of a JAGUAR report on STEBONY/1 and Marc SCHLEIFER. JAGUAR states that the information was received from a "most secret and delicate source which has been found reliable on previous occasions."

"STEBONY/1 was in contact with Marc SCHLEIFER while the latter was staying in London with his family, en route for Algeria. SCHLEIFER had planned to leave London for Algiers via Paris on the 2nd June, but he deferred his departure in order to meet STEBONY/1. It seems that SCHLEIFER wanted, if possible, to visit Tanzania also. STEBONY/1 apparently was prepared to help SCHLEIFER and his family to find accommodation while they were in London because they had little money. He is also reported to have said that there was a possibility of his co-operating with SCHLEIFER in Africa."

"According to our source, SCHLEIFER, while in London, arranged to contact the Tanzanian Mission, in connection with a job in Dar-es-Salaam which might be taken by either SCHLEIFER or STEBONY/1."

2. Ref A contains previous JAGUAR comments about STEBONY/1 and SCHLEIFER, of about the same period. While TIFFANY was in London (which puts it at the right time) STEBONY/1 was in touch with SCHLEIFER, and TIFFANY should be able to compare JAGUAR's comments with what STEBONY/1 said at the time. Ref B reflects a different contact between the two, from a different source.

8. No commitments other than those stated above have been made to the subject. Moreover, in cases where travel and/or operational expenses and/or per diem are provided or furnished in money or in kind from other than CPYOKE sources, ODYOKE will offset such funds, goods, or services against the obligations assumed in the above oral commitments.

1. OFL-12 and OFL-13 were passed to the appropriate Headquarters desk for the evaluation requested in reference.

2. The results of the evaluations were that the reports based on STEBOHY/1's elicitation contained "nothing more than chit-chat and opinion" with no new information that could be disseminated. As indicated in the last sentence of reference this result was not unanticipated by LCPIPIT.

3. In view of STEBONY/1's reportorial capabilities however, we hope that his continued efforts to elicit and report timely information vill be vigorously maintained.

1. JAGUAR, in acknowledging receipt of the processed STEBONY/1 material that we forwarded to them, have also asked for "further information about Francois MASPERO and Professor Nguyen KIEN. We should be most grateful for any further identifying particulars for both MASPERO and KIEN and with regard to the latter, we should particularly like to know his present position in connection with 'Africa, Agia, Latin America Revolution' and whether he still holds a teaching appointment in Frpace."

2. JAGUAR's note was shown to RODIGAST in London on 12 August, just before RODIGAST met with STEBONY/1. LCPIPIT please provide anything that can be had for passage to JAGUAR.

3. As should be fairly apparent, I think, from reading the material we passed to JAGUAR, plus the fact that there has been no "Revolution" for lo! these many months, the status of anyone connected with the magazine is about as uncertain as the status of the magazine itself. Nonetheless, we will be happy to let JAGUAR know as much as we can.

1.  BAIRN, a sensitive SMOTH operation, provides the following report relating to STEBONY/1 (date of info, 26 July 1965):

    "STEBONY/1 (previously in touch with Pablo FERNANDEZ while in London, en route with family to Algiers for the international conference postponed when Ben BELLA was over- thrown) calls Pablo FERNANDEZ, tells him he (S/1) is just back from North Africa if the confernece is held in November. Says he has been unable to get any news of (Marc) SCHLEIFFER, and asks whether Pablo has heard of him. Pablo says he had a letter, brought by hand from SCHLEIFFER in Algeria, saying he (SCHLEIFFER) was going the next week to Cairo, and would write to Pablo from there. He has not yet written. S/1 says they had hunted for his high andlow in Algiers - he disappeared completely from the conference scene, and they thought that per- haps he had got mixed up in the (troubles between the new regime and Ben BELLA's faction), Pablo assures S/1 that SCHLEIFFER is all right. He knows this from a negro journalist, on "the Guardian" in the U.S.A. and coming from Pennsylvania, who covered the Algiers conference preparations. The journalist's name is, Larry HENRY or something similar. Pablo and S/1 agree to meet to-morrow (27th July), S/l will call Pablo then to fix time and place. At 10.35 5/1 calls FERNANDEZ, arranges to call for him at the Embassy at 13.30 hours for them to lunch together."

## RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

Professor JOHN K. GALBRAITH, Economics Department,
Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, presently
vacationing at his summer residence, Newfane, Vermont,
advised on July 12, 1957, that applicant has been his
secretary and general assistant at Harvard University for
the past four years. Professor GALBRAITH said he highly
recommends the applicant as to character, reputation and
loyalty. He further stated the applicant is a first-rate
person, very superior, intelligent, and well qualified for
the position she seeks. Professor GALBRAITH stated he is
aware of the position the applicant seeks in view of the
fact that he recommended her for this position.

Professor GALBRAITH was investigated in 1950 as
"JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH, also known as J. KENNETH GALBRAITH,
KENNETH GALBRAITH, Consultant-Appointee, Commodities
Division, Office of the Director, Office of Industry and
Commerce, United States Department of Commerce, Washington,
D.C., - LOYALTY OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES" under the provisions
of Executive Order 9835. On March 2, 1951, the Civil Service
Commission advised that JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH resigned or
otherwise separated from Federal service, prior to decision
on loyalty.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
REF. CFLA-2561, 22 June 1965

1. Subject to Brussels Station views, Headquarters believes that STEBONY's proposal in Reference is a good one and very consistent with our interests that he develop his access and acceptability within the circles of which Ref Iden A is a significant figure. We realize that the picture is a complicated one, and that Iden A of Ref may or may not yet prove to have the staying power of the successful political figure. At the same time, it does seem that he is the most outstanding leader of the anti-revisionists today, and as such merits our attention.

2. With regard to Reference para 4's concern about possible damage to our national interest by publication of the book in English, we tend to side vith STEBONY in feeling that the support which such a publication might render to our enemies could not really be detected by the naked eye. Similarly, while agreeing with the sentiment that would critically scrutinize all proposals by nev assets, we note that STEBONY is, indeed, supposed to be seeking to regain status among his former associates, and that Ref proposal does not, to our view, contain any hint which would suggest that in following out this line of action at our direction, he is motivated by any ulterior or concealed aim different from that which led us to impose the commission in the first place.

3. We are attempting to get a rough translation done on a priority basis. STEBONY, of course, should understand that such a translation vill be unfinished, and should be carefully reviewed for the proper "feel," to rule out usage or interpretation which STKBONY, with his background, would never have inferred from the French text. Honethe-less, as the document has come to hand only on 2 July, and given the holiday weekend, the limitation on the number of translators available, the existence of other translation assignments, and, finally, the pouch transit time back to Rome, we regret that it will not be possible to get this product to RODIGAST for his 15 July meeting.

Dear Katzenbach,

TO: Chief, KUDISH
FROM: Chief of Station, London
Attachment to OELA-43,589
13 July 1965

I'm pleased you have received at least one of my letters, but I still wonder if you got a large envelope containing three letters which had been held and return all at once. As one of the letters was rather detailed and dealt with matters of some importance, I'm rather disconcerted -- to say the least -- to think that it may not have found its way to you. The envelope measured 8 by 5 inches and was light tan in color. A confirmation of its receipt would be appreciated.

Of course, I understood about the service, the newsletter, not being a definite thing. In any case, I am not looking for a sinecure, but for a good, deep cover and that seemed to be one. It also gave me something to offer contacts and would have strengthened my position considerably. At present, my cover is as light as the Emperor's new clothes.

Still no positive reply from any publication in the States, and the general silence from my American "friends" is not very encouraging. Here, the situation is much-better, and if I can get to Algiers in good time, after visiting Grippa and Andersson and seeing some contacts in Paris, my position will be better, but I still see myself representing the West Indian Gazette or Cinnamon and/or the Institute of Race Relations. Mrs. Sheila Patterson, their editor, even suggested that I do a short paper-back book for them, gathering together the conference documents with an analysis. All of this is better than nothing, but it definitely isn't much.

On the other hand, for the future, Noureddine Medjdoub, who has been Tunisian cultural attaché here, is returning to Tunis to take over the editorship of the Socialist Destour Party paper, L'Action. He has suggested that I write some features for him, after the Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers and that I try to get to Tunis to discuss future projects with him while I am in North Africa. You well know what many Africans and Arabs think of Tunisia at present, so there may not be much that we can do with this arrangement.

This afternoon, I saw Dennis Phombeah at the Tanganian High Commission. Until three months ago, he was at the U.N. He claims that Vergès came to London last December and saw Babu about me and other matters, but that Babu was not convinced. He says he did not know that I was in London until recently -- this was our first meeting since the spring of 1964. Now, he proposes that he try to get the editorship of The Nationalist, the TANU paper in Dar es Salaam, for me. We will discuss the matter again at lunch next Monday. It would be a fixed post in Dar and I can't yet fathom why he is willing to suggest me for the job. He claims he has not been in touch with Vergès.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action requested: Paragraph 3.

1. Career Agent Rufus F. RODIGAST has been briefed by Paris/ LCPIPIT on an ad hoc basis to date regarding information on the Afro-Asias national liberation movement of operational interest to his handling and guidance of STEBONY/1. As the STEBONY operation progresses, however, it is LCPIPIT's intention that those handling STKBONY/1 become more knowledgeable on the subject of the national liberation movement than STEBONY/1, himself, as a means to ensure the best possible operational guidance to the agent and to provide another element of agent control--superior knowledge.

2. LCPIPIT's limited files include two basic documents:
   Attachment to OPIM 630, and Book Dispatch No. 4463. We also have selected disseminations and reports on Chinese Communist activities in Africa. What would be most useful, however, would be a collection of reports and analyses, whether overt or covert, discussing the following topics: a) Jacques GRIPPA and the pro-Chinese European Communist factions; b) the Afro-Asian Journalists Association (the Headquarters TPRANSACK c/o has had a file on this organization's founding); c) the individual national liberation movements and d) operations of the national liberation movements, individually and collectively, out of such centers as Algiers (at least up to 19 June 1965), Dar es Salaam, Accra, Cairo, Djakarta, Havana, etc/.; e) national liberation movement relations with, and operations out of, the Bloc, both Moscow and Peking oriented; f) support and guidance of the national liberation movement by non-Bloc communist parties and selected fronts.

3. We recognize that much of the information on the above mentioned topics may not yet be collated, if indeed it is available; however, we should appreciate receiving from Headquarters such materials as you feel would best meet LCPIPIT's operational needs in working with STEBONY/1. Of special value would be a bibliography of overt writing on the subject, greatly alleviating the security problem and more logistics of bringing RODIGAST and a large volume of classified reading together, in a secure environment, over an extended period.

2. The following further information has been received from a secret and reliable source:

i) GIBSON was to leave London on the 8th June en route to Algiers via Brussels, Lausanne and Paris, and he expects to arrive in Algiers about the 20th June.

ii) GIBSON has said that he will be in Algiers in his capacity as a journalist and that while there he may be contacted through Georges ARNOUD at the Directorate of Information or through an American, Marc SCHLEIFER, who is the representative in Algiers of the 2nd of May Movement. He has also said that he is anxious to meet some responsible members of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association Secretariat in order to clear his name of the charges brought against him by VERGES.

iii) As a journalist GIBSON is hoping to be allowed to attend the Second Afro-Asian Journalists' Association Conference and he has made enquiries as to when it will be held.

iv) In commenting on an invitation which has been extended to Hodee EDWARDS to visit North Korea, possibly via Indonesia, GIBSON has said that he would very much like to visit Indonesia but that there is little chance of his doing so as the West Indian newspapers by which he might be employed would be unlikely to pay the cost of his fare.

At their 15 March meeting, (REBONY/1 and RODIGAST discussed QREBONY/1's running his own pro-Chicon group, at least as a paper organization to allow him to get close to target conferences and institutions as a bona fide delegate rather than bystander. QREBONY/1 feels that if not done right this could cause trouble, because of usual organizational rivalries. He is thinking of beginning by writing and circulating a statement in support of the statement on "Afro-American Liberation" which appeared in the 6 December Ad Hoc Bulletin (Marxist-Leninist) in Chicago. He would use a pseudonym to sign his statement, but would let all his friends know that the pseudonym was really himself, and he might use Manchanda's address. Perhaps Grippa would agree to circulate or print it. If this statement goes over, CREBONY/1 could escalate into a small organization. He will show RODIGAST a craft of his statement, but also will discuss it with Manchanda for "ideological purity".

SUBJECT: DTDORIC/Operational QREBONY/Salary Raise for CREBONY/1

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1.  At the time of his recruitment in June 1965, QREBONY/1 was told that his $600 monthly tax-free salary would be raised to $800 once he got a job in a target organization, which of course was the goal of his planned summer activity in Algiers.

2.  Through no fault of his own, the Algiers assignment (and other possibil- ities, such as Djakarta) evaporated shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, WOFACT changed its signals and eventually decided to base QREBONY/1 in Europe targeted against individuals and groups in various countries.

3.  From the beginning, QREBONY/1 has proved more than satisfactory as an agent. lie has carried out assignments given to him with knowledge and tact and the proper spirit, has used his own initiative as much as our guidance, and has not violated our instructions. No one will argue that he hasn't proved to be better than we collectively thought he would be, and in terms of his own abilities-apart from targets which may or may not be accessible to him he is getting better all the time.

4.  Last year, about a year later than CREEONY/l might have expected his salary to go up from $600 to $800, ve raised it to $700. He was pleased, and he has not complained as much as he used to about a shortage of funds. (Presumably QREBONY/1 is responsive to the generally good treatment he has had, to the respect for him as an individual and the appreciation of his services; probably he is carried along as such by his own personal satisfaction in knowing he is meeting requirements and continually breaking new ground.)

5.  Nevertheless, LCPIPIT believes the time has come to raise QREEOKY/1's salary to the promised level. We can all agree that we are still getting his services cheap; QREBONY/1 receives no quarters, living allowance, or educational allowance for his children. His increased gratitude, the relief he will undoubt- edly feel at being able to reduce his present financial worries, are more than worth the extra $100.

6. If Headquarters agrees, the money can be paid through QRPURE (whose monthly check will go up from $100 to $200 in this event). QRPURE could write to QREBONY/1 expressing his pleasure at the results of syndication of GREEONY/1's meterial, and announcing that the monthly fee will go up to $200; alternatively, QREBONY/1 could write to QRPURE saying he feels the sum should go up, and QRPURE would reply affirmatively.

AFF. GIBSON C/VERGES

Chers Madame et Monsieur,

Je m'empresse de vous faire savoir que j'ai fait
citer la Société des NOUVELLES EDITIONS INTERNATIONALES
pour l'audience du 13 avril prochain.

Or, je viens d'appendre que celle-ci est mise en
faillite et que Monsieur PINTA, Syndic de faillite, a été
nommé par jugement du Tribunal de Commerce.

Je ne vois pas, dans ces conditions, l'intérêt que
vous avez à poursuivre le paiement de sommes qui vous sont
dues par cette Société dont le passif dépasse de loin tout
actif.

Voudriez-vous, je vous prie, me donner vos instruc-
tions définitives compte tenu de cette situation.

Je vous indique d'ailleurs que vous pouvez produire
à la faillite entre les mains du syndic, mais que bien
entendu celui-ci vous demandera un jugement pour pouvoir
inscrire votre créance toute théorique contre la Société
qui, comme je vous l'indique plus haut n'a que des dettes
et aucun actif.

J'attends donc de vos nouvelles et vous prie de
croire, chers Madame et Monsieur, à l'expression de mes
sentiments dévoués.

S. SCHWARTZENBERG,
Avocat a la Cour.

q. At a meeting held on August 14, 1966, STANFORD mentioned that Robert Williams allegedly has $1,000,000 available for the use of RAM.

NY T-10 advised on September 26, 1966, that STANFORD prior to moving to Philadelphia on September 18, 1966, discussed RAM and ROBERT F. WILLIAMS with him. According to the source, STANFORD has alleged WILLIAMS has money available for RAM.

During the course of the conversation, STANFORD stated that the contact man between RAM in the US and R. Willians' is one Richard GIBSON in Paris, France. STANFORD stated that GIBSON passes on messages from WILLIAMS and will be the man contacted by whoever is designated as a courier to go to China to get the money. Source also stated that he was told Richard GIBSON was living in the Crystal Hotel (phonetác), Paris, France, and was working out of the La Royale Cafe (phonetic), Paris, France.

BY LIAISON

Date: October 24, 1966

To: Director
Central Intelligence Agency

Attention: Deputy Director, Plans

From: John Edgar Hoover, Director

Subject: RICHARD GIBSON
INFORMATION CONCERNING

A source of this Bureau who has furnished reliable information in the past recently advised that during the Fall of 1966, a member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist organization stated that one Richard Gibson was suspected of being a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency. According to this individual, Gibson recently had been in Milan, Italy, in the company of a female secretary from Paris, whose home is in New Rochelle, New York. At that time Gibson remarked his travel and activities were possible because he had married a wealthy English woman. Other things were said which aroused the suspicions of the Italian.

According to our source, the Italian pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist subsequently relayed his suspicions concerning Gibson to Rene Raindorf, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium (Marxist-Leninist). Raindorf reportedly thereafter met in Brussels, Belgium, with Gibson although he had indicated the Belgian pro-Chinese communists would look into the charges of the Italian Marxist-Leninist.

II The arrangement between the cover firm and QREBONY/1 should be on the basis of a regular subvention to CREBONY/1 to act as a foreign stringer contributing feature-type material to the press service. An agreement having been ostensibly entered into by QRBOHY/1 snd the cover firm during the former's trip to the U.8. (cxpected around 20 Jaly), a regiler monthly check should be forvarded to QEZBONY/1 by the cover firm, along with any correspondence it my see fit (suggestions for pieces to write, comments ca picces received etc.)

III The following steps are proposed to set this cover in sotion:

A. At a meeting on 6 July, QREBONY/ will be instructed to write a number of U.8. news media organizations stating that he expects to travel to the U.8. shortly, describing his news background and indicating he would be interested in developing case outlets for his writing. The cover organisation is ons of those addresses.

B. CIA's contact in the cover organization rocalves this letter and, purevant to our direction, writes da ansver stoting 1) what his fim does, 2) that it would be very interested in handling CREDONY/1's product if it seems to fit the needs and 3) that it would be ready to reladuree some of GREBONY/1's cxpenses if he could come to Chicago te discuss the matter further.

C. CAFRONT/1 does not meet the contact in the cover organization. He is briefel to offer the story, on his return, that ba had entered into a regular errengement with the cover fins to produse feature material usable by the cover fira (not specifying the frequacy) in rotara for which he is to receive a monthly retainer.

D. Any letter GREEORI/1, may later vish to send to the cover fire should be given to us in copy preferably before it is sant.

E. Copies of any correspondence initiated by the cover firm should be zade available to CIA and, particularly, to the Prajert Case Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

VIA: Chief, CCS/NC

SUBJECT: Request for Approval for Operational Use of U.S. Free-Lance Writer - QREBONY/1

1. This memorandum submits a recommendation for your approval pursuant to CSI 240-6, 10 January 1963, paragraph 6, governing operational involvement of personalities in the field of journalism. This request concerns cover support for CREBONY/1, an asset currently handled by CA Staff, and involves the cooperation of Russell R. DeBow, a Chicago city official and proprietor of the Negro Press International Inc. CREBONY/1 was granted a POA on 23 May 1966, and a full operational approval is pending. The project under which he is handled was approved by Acting ADDP on 14 June 1966. Mr. DeBow was granted a Covert Security Approval on 19 April 1966.

2. QREBONY/1 is an American Negro e.patriate journalist and author presently residing in London. He is the author of one novel and numerous contributions to a wide variety of publication, such as the *Kenyon Review*, *Monthly Review*, *The Nation*, *The Liberator* and others. He worked as a reporter for the *Philadelphia Arro American* in 1950, for Agence France Presse in 1959, for CBS in 1960 and, in Europe, for the now defunct, pro-Chinese magazine *Revolution*. As a result of broad contacts and acceptance among radical, pro-Chinese and Negro militant circles, he has offered valuable access to important targets spanning four continents, and has demonstrated considerable skill in elicitation and exploitation of contacts for intelligence purposes in the process. The immediate and paramount operational objective for this agent is to gain direct access to hostile political targets in North Viet Nam and China. The outstanding requirement to be met in support of this objective, and of his continued effective exploitation generally, is the development of a backstopped and viable explanation for at least a portion of his income, which presently derives almost exclusively from clandestine CIA support. The proposal outlined below represents the conclusion of considerable research, including an interview with Mr. DeBow, to identify suitable cover arrangements which would make possible this explanation.

SECRET

201-306052


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 180

SECRET

3. Mr. DeBow, a lawyer, is an Administrative Assistant to the Mayor of
   Chicago as well as a long time, if casual, contact of Domestic Contacts Service.
   His background includes assignment to the Intelligence Division of the Chicago
   police and cooperation with CIA in the course of a trip to Africa in 1961.
   Mr. DeBow also is part owner and in effective control of a very small feature
   syndicate in Chicago, the Negro Press International, Inc., which distributes
   rewritten news to Negro newspapers in the United States on a subscription basis.

4. On 20 June 1966, Mr. DeBow was approached by representatives of CA Staff
   and Central Cover Staff, acknowledging CIA connection, and interviewed with a
   view to determining the feasibility of using his service to backstop modest
   payments to GREBONY/1 for real or ostensible contributions of feature stories
   and reporting. (Since the contact was made to develop information pertinent
   to the present request for DDP approval, the interview was conducted on a
   hypothetical basis: QREBONY/l's identity was not revealed nor were any
   commitments entered into.) This conversation, despite its limitation, demonstrated
   clearly that such an arrangement involving Mr. DeBow and his firm would be
   practical from Mr. DeBow's point of view and well suited to the needs of the
   QREBONY Project. Mr. DeBow grasped the problem involved and suggested various
   means by which he could plausibly implement a cover arrangement should this
   be our decision. He was made aware of and understood the incongruity between
   his and QREBONY/1's ostensible political positions, and stated that this need
   offer no impediment to creation of the type of relationship which would be
   involved. The nature of Mr. DeBow's feature service and its modest size
   clearly enhance its usefulness and appropriateness for our objectives.
   Mr. DeBow, in conclusion, expressed his agreement in principle to participate
   in this cover support activity should CIA, on further review of its needs,
   decide to proceed with a request for his cooperation.

5. In the light of the very favorable response from Mr. DeBow and the
   determiration, from reviewing the outlines of his operation, that it would
   be a uniquely appropriate backstopping for QREBONY/1, your approval is
   requested to recontact Mr. DeBow and establish with him suitable cover

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Finance

VIA:

Contract Personnel Division

SUBJECT: QREBONY/1 - Amendment of Memorandum of Oral Commitment

1. The Memorandum of Oral Commitment with QREBONY is amended effective 15 June 1966 to provide indemnification in the amount of $10,000 in case of death, and payment of $600 per month up to $10,000 to his wife in case of total incapacitation or disappearance.

2. It is anticipated that a trip planned for late summer or early fall will take QREBONY into VC controlled areas of South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and China. Indemnification is intended to apply to death or disability resulting from air accident, act of war, or for disappearance.

3. Without being able to specify the possible circumstances, it is intended that such indemnification as outlined above be deemed to apply to loss of life or functions suffered by QREBONY as a direct result of his Kubáki relationship during the trip. Such indeanification, if made, must be presented to his widow by a cover mechanisa which would hide KUBARK involvement.

PROVISIONAL OPERATIONAL APPROVAL

NUMBER
201 - 305052

SUBJECT
QREBONY/1

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Dated

10 February 1966

A Provisional Operational Approval is granted for the use of this Subject as set forth below.

A Provisional Operational Approval issued by CI Staff grants the same authority, on a temporary basis, for the use of an individual as the authority granted in an Operational Approval unless otherwise specified by CI/OA. It is based, however, only on preliminary file checks and investigation and is subject to a further final review when all investigation is completed.

(1) POA is granted to utilize Subject in an international context to exploit his contacts and/or associations with a wide variety of personalities and organizations (particularly Cuban and Chinese) engaged in "anti-imperialist" propaganda operations. Subject will be expected to renew his old relationships and expand his circle of contacts with Afro-Asian national liberation leaders, pro Chinese Communist, and similar personalities and to report general political and biographic material relative to the interests, activities and plans of such individuals and their organizations.

(2) Requirements passed to Subject will be confined, insofar as it is operationally feasible, to instructions for the refinement and completeness of the reporting he is capable of providing from his normal intercourse with source personalities. Disclosure of classified information will be held to a minimum, he will not be given operational assignments supporting or servicing other KUBARK Operations, nor will he participate directly and/or wittingly in the spotting and/or recruitment of other agents.

(3) In addition to this background, certain of Subject's past statements and behavior are inconsistent with, and give rise to an uncertainty about, the nature and degree of his presently professed motivations and loyalties. It is impossible to resolve this uncertainty with the knowledge now available. At the present time, therefore, it is believed that his bona fides have not been established to an extent which would warrant handling him in any way than "at arms length".

To process the Operational Approval, full information (completed PRQ Parts I and II) must be submitted as soon as possible and not later than six (6) months from this date. An Operational Approval will follow when all investigation is completed and upon the receipt of satisfactory PPQ Parts I and II. Cancellation must be requested if use of Subject by interested Divisions ceases.

1. At his 6 April meeting with RODIGAST, GRKBONY/1 pointed out thet his
   brother-in-law (the accountant) still thinks that UREBONY receives regular income
   from an American radio or news feature service, paid through Switzerland, and
   undeclared for tax reasons (UREBONY's and the American company's taxes).

2. RODIGAST thought that if the brother-in-law finds this story hard to
   believe he my guess that GREBONY is really working for KUBARK and may have passed
   this information on to the British. Thus he would be the source of the story
   relayed in reference.

3. At the same meeting, on another subject, RODICAST asked CREBONY whether
   he had ever told anyone pointblank that he (GREBONY) is a Chicom agent. He said
   that he never had. RODIGAST broke in: "or the agent of any other country,
   including CDYOKE?" QREBONY said he had not.

SUBJECT: DTDORIC/Operational
GRPREY/OREBONY/QREDONY/1's New Contact, Carole Piña

1. We are manifesting reports and correspondence concerning QREBONY/1's new contact, Carole Piña, an American, age 31, born in New York City (possibly Bronx County), whose father's last name was Appel or Appell. lier husband's name is Carlos Piña (Mexican), but she is separated from him and he is seeking a divorce. She holds US passport, No. D633873, issued 5 August 1963 in New York; it comes up for renewal in August (at which time she expects to be in Rome). She is afraid that her having traveled to Cuba in 1964 with a Progressive Labor delegation will hurt her chances of getting a renewal of her passport.

2. Subject had been having a series of political and amorous affairs during her stay in Dar, and was in serious trouble when Q met her. After rejecting Dennis Thombeah's advances, she was in serious danger of being declared a prohibited imaigrant; Q befriended her, and he and Colman Ferrer of the Cuban Embassy (who had been having an affair with her) saw that she got out of Dar safely. Qwas to weet her in Cairo (but in fact had no intention of doing so) and later caught up with her in Rome. She indicated a desire to work with Q (without quite knowing for whom she would be working--he hinted rather broadly to her that he was in cahoots with "our friends in the East," but it will be noted that in one of her letters there is this disarwing phrase: she warns him about how to deal with certain persons and adds: "be cool with them do not show your true colors (whatever they are)").

3. Q seized on the opportunity of using subject as an unwitting informant and eventually agent on the same basis. She submitted to an interview on tape in a Rome hotel room which lasts about 2-1/4 hours, in which Q debriefs her on her knowledge of every Tanzanian, liberation movement, or Bloc personality with whow she had contact, and in view of her attractiveness and willingness she kne quite a few. (She had some amusing run-ins with ODYOKE personnel in Dar, which we shall edit out of the tape only for a fee.)

4. Q feels that she is emotionally unstable--his firmness in dealing with her, his making it clear he was not out for her body, have made him a guardian and true friend. She seems to be a good political reporter, understanding her own (confused) political yearnings and where her various contacts stand; she also seems to have a good memory for details. Q says that her "anti-revisionism" is incipient anti-Communism. He could eventually recruit her as an ODYOKE witting agent, but that would take a lot of time and trouble; with much less effort he could effect a false-flag recruitment, and indeed, he has already done this on an informal basis by making it clear that he was collecting material for his Chicom friends. She would undertake further assignments for him. üe actually asked her, "Suppose I asked you to go somewhere, would you go?" To which she replied, "If it's not cold." It is unlikely, however, that she would be able to return to Dar because of Phombeah's hostility. Wherever she goes, her main asset will be her physical attraction.

5. She could be debriefed further on any point raised in the tape interview. The ideal would be to have the questions by the time Q goes to Rome in the second half of April, but this does not seem to be a likely possibility.

SUBJECT: DTDORIC QRPREY CREBONY Relations with JAGUAR

ACTION REQUIRED

REFERENCES: Ref: LOND 2425, 2 March 1966

1.  A number of lengthly and fruitful discussions have been held with JAGUAR officers regarding our continued running of QRZEONY in the U.K. Their comments on the quality of CRIZONY's reporting have been reported from time to time. Similarly, we will not dwell here on the mechanical arrangements we have evolved (with SLOTH's agreement) to expedite the passage of information to JAGUAR, on the one hand, and avoid duplicate reporting (principally by passing the same materials as CS dissents to SLOTH) on the other hand. Suffice it here to say that achieving both of these goals, without compromising CREECNY as a source throughout both JAGUAR and SMOTH (due largely to the wide range of areas he reports on), is a complex problem. We think we have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement for achieving both aims.

2.  What we are concerned with here, then, is JAGUAR'S permission for us to run CREBONY from here, for the time being at least. The exact phrasing from JAGUAR's letter agreeing to our request is: "with regard to the continued use of QREBONY by your service on a temporary basis while he remains in this country we have no objection to this provided we are kept fully informed of as much detail as possible."

3.  JAGUAR pointed out that CREBONY operates in the same areas as some of JAGUAR's own agents, and this necessitates a fair amount of frankness regarding his activities in the U.K. We have made every effort to date to display to them that frankness. In return, JAGUAR has been cooperative, if not downright helpful. In one of our discussions, SHILL confidentially stated that one of their sources had quoted a sub-source as saying that CREBONY had admitted to him that he is a KUBARK agent. We assured JAGUAR that CREBONY is under instructions not to reveal his KUBARK relationship, of course; that QREBONY is not supposed to be recruiting any sub-agents and has not done so; that the remark could well have been made in jest, in reference to the charges levelled against CREBONY three years ago (or longer). We told JAGUAR that it would obviously be advantageous for us to know to whom QREBONY is alleged to have made the statement, and we would be grateful if JAGUAR could tell us. We have repeated this request in writing, but with no reply to date. SHILL stated at the time that he had doubts about whether they could identify to us the person who had made the statement; he was sure that they could not go back to their agent for elaboration without showing an undue interest in CREBONY. We may yet hear who the person was. All this is repeated here merely to indicate how far JAGUAR will go to be helpful, and how far, to date, they will not go.

2. Agent is aware of U.S. intelligence interest, has not been explicitly appraised of CIA involvement but no doubt suspects it.

3. Agent has never entered any installations associated with CIA.

4. There is no U.S. identification of the Agent with CIA outside of Staff personnel. British intelligence (see paragraph 5 below). His wife (whose family resides in England) is unwitting.

5. The Agent is known in true name to the MI-5 and MI-6 of the United Kingdom.

6. None. It should be noted that the contemplated cover will not be a relationship which the Agent (any more than the cover) will proclaim or flaunt, given the fact that in his highly anti-American circle, such a connection would be regarded as unsavory. The purpose of the cover is to backstop the Agent's story that he receives income from hack journalism which he keeps separate from his "real" if unrewarding involvement with radical politics.

7. No.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 197

A. QRBONY/1 (Q) gives the convincing impression that he is at home in his new work. He responds well to sugestions and instructions, adds suggestions of his own for improving the plan-- an indication that he wishes to please. in the begirring he showed a tendency to raise minor objections involving personal material problems (e..., inconvenience to family life of a long tdy) but less of this was remarked as he came to realize that requirements were to be reasonable and he was to be treated as a human being with his own problems.

He has stated that he would not continue his present involvement with target personalities and institutions if it were not that we wish him to, i.e., his own inclination would te to withdraw from the political fringe. Podigast feels that this is consistent with his background, which was not a party career; in his youth he was willfully apolitical and hostile to the "movement"; later he was involved in opposing party people in his New York work; in Paris he didn't get along with his party friends (the affair of the forged letter) and of course broke with the magazine crowd there.

He seems to be genuinely committed to working against enemies of CDYE, ready to accept even deeper commitment; he has expressed no reservations as to what he will do. He doesn't object to reporting on old Friends, fellow BPRIDERS, et al. He raised no objection to FLUTTER, or using 3/w techniques (which he took with him on a trip to what was then a very hostile area, where he had known enemies, and where there was a recent history of dealing roughly with outsiders). when orders conflict with personal desires (for example, when he planned to spend a weekend in a city he enjoys but was told he should proceed immediately to his next stopping place), he obeys without hesitation.

The foregoing is a collection of miscellaneous facts, but taken together they paint the portrait of a promising agent, both in terms of motivations and abilities.

B. Rodigast's knowledge of Q's attitude in the months prior to recruitment (June 1965) is limited. Rodigast has the impression had simply reached the end of his rope-- he had nowhere to go, he had earlier decided that he would like to work for or at least cooperate with ODYOK'S (although earlier attempts to make contact met with no success).

The humane treatment received at the hands of his recruiter, the subsequent sympathetic handling by his case officer, undoubtedly convinced him that he had not made a mistake.

The material factor is not to be underestimated.

The demoralizing position of living on his wire and worse, on her family, must have lowered his resistance to any possible alternative. Rodigast simply doesn't know how Q might have responded to a reasonable offer from enemies of ODYOG at that point. The prospect of immediate engagement at a decent wage may have been ċecisive.

Since that time, Rodigast feels Q's motivation has been reinforced and perhaps considerably alterea: he has been asked to do obviously necessary tasks, and so he can feel he is needed by someone; he has been given reasonable instructions on how to accomplish them; he sees that others are concerned for his personal safety and material wellbeing. Rodigast has taken pains to avożi giving the impression that there was any contusion or error or difference of viewpoint in running the project (even at a time when there were plenty of all three); such problems were


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 198

2

resolved before being taken up with Q, and thus he has a somewhat rosy
view of the operation. The satisfaction of accomplishment (i.e., being
able to produce useful answers to our questions) is surely a factor
in his present attitude.

Though light-skinned, with a voice and accent which would be
considered acceptable in any POPRIL society, Qis extremely sensitive
to the fact that he is a Negro. He has not said or suggested any such
thing to Rodigast, but this is so obvious a facter in his correspondence
(even discounting the extent to which the correspondence is part of
his conscious cover) that it seems to Rodigast that it must be a factor
in his life. On the other hand, kodigast has knom another llegro who
was a close friend of Q (and now one of his major enemies, as a result
of the Paris forged letter incident and contributing events) who was
so sensitive about race that he makes Qin retrospect seem like an
Uncle Tom.

Still, Rodigast does not believe Q could be handled by someone
who is not genuinely a "niger lover", i.e., who could not convey
a convincing image of a person for whom a color difference was not a
barrier (Q would surely detect the false "pal"). Q has mentioned anti-
Negro prejudice as a reason for his refusal to cooperate with ODY
officers who talked to him while he was in New York. In fact, Q deais,
with his present case officer as a possible if not a true friend;
they share an interest and involvement in writing, English literature,
living happily abroad, etc.; Rodigast has tried to read Dante in the
original and Q has done so; Rodigast would like to write a novel and
Q has published one; Rodigast doesn't know much about the post-logical
positivists who interest Q but probably gives a convincing impression
that he would like to know about them, and just might be capable of
understanding them. What all the foregoin" means is that in Q we have
an accomplished person, and it is a useful tactic to treat him if
not as a superior than at the very least as an equal.

There remains the possibility that opportunistic reasons are
primary: Q joined the organization and stayed with us because he could
not do as well in any other job, could in fact get no job (because of
his background, his alien status abroad, etc). Rodigast does not exclude
this, although he feels that whatever the original motivation, it has
been strengthened and perhaps converted into something more worthy.
But even if his primary motivation remains material, the history of the
project over its first nine months suggest it is a viable one.

C. Q has lived in the underground for so many years without
breaking that it is likely he will be able to continue to do so. He thinks
fast, handles himseli well in matters presenting security problems.
He is not fully trained for clandestine activity. Rodigast's long
meetings with him always include advice on one or more specific aspects
of clandestine work, which when added yp may be taken to represent a
short course, but that is all. The lack of training has led Q to do or
say things which Rodigast would not have wished him to do or say, and
whenever possible this has been brought to Q's attention, and he seems
responsive to such instruction.

Rodigast would not recommend that Q be given a training course,
but this would not preclude more formal sessions with Rodigast during
which Rodigast could give more complete instruction on various phases
of clandestine work.

1


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 199

Q gives the impres ion of not being easily moved. He has already survived violent attacks, questi ning by legislative committees and police (including abroad), public denunciation; now that he has KUBARK as a friend he should resist at least as well as before. One negative trait is his need to take revenge for injury, and this tendency must be controlled; his instinct to be spiteful to an enemy could conflict with a longer-range plan.

It is to te hoped that the present situation regarding his wife (who believes him to be working for the arch fea of B-RIME) will be possible to maintain. She doesn't like the situation much, but accepts it, and apparently hasn't betrayed his "confidence". If he is moved to another city which both Q and his wife would consider agreeable (Rome) she would probably be even happier and less likely to revolt, especially if a quarters allowance helped them get out of their present financial straits (they can pay rent and buy food but not save or repay debts- so his wife says he is doing an unpleasant thing without even being able to say they are better off than they were in Paris). If he were sent to a less agreeable place for six months or a year (say Dar) he would went to settle his wife in a desirable place (London but preferably kome) for the children's schooling; here too her attitude would depend on their caterial cosition and on the possibility of his being able to visit on occasion (if he were in Dar, say, and she in Rome, he would return for visits- which would also be cover for his meetings with his case officer). Rodigast recommends that once in place, Q's basic wage be raised (as promised in June 1965) from $600 to $800, but that he also receive quarters and ir possible an educational aliowance.

D. Q says he is a local PBPRIMER. He now does act like one. Rodigast feels the evidence for his loyalt is at least as good as it is for most other PBRRIMERS he knows. Early in their relationship (probably mid-June 1965 in Paris) Q had said he had turned away i'rom the revolutionary movement and toward his own country; even though there were opportunistic reasons for him to have done so, he is seemingly not anti-PBPRDE. His views on Negro problems in PBRFINE probably have not changed, but he never was a black nationalist, and has many friends, besides his wife, who are white). He might not agree with ODY policy in Vietnam, Cuba, or elsewhere-- he obviously has not been questioned on his personal beliefs- but his dissent, if dissent there be, is not disloyalty, and in any case should not prevent him from executing KUBARK policy to the letter. Undoubtedly he has a leftist economic orientation, but there is no evidence that it is an orthodox Marxist one (or that it ever was).

He seems to like Rodigast; in any event they work well together. He has made no effort to develop a warm relationship with Rodigast, however, apparently feeling that this is not necessary, might not be appreciated, and would conflict with the compartmentalization so obviously kept in force by Rodigast (who hasn't told his true name, address, marital status, or any other personal fact which might lead to identifying him). Seemingly does not believe the name which Rodigast used at their introduction was a true name, for he didn't bother to remember it (the last name), and all this would tend to discourage the building up of a personal friendship.

It is probable that he respects rather than scorns KUBARK for its decent treatment of him. AUBATK through Rodigast has always kept its promises, Rodigast has never been a minute late for a meeting (Q has


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 200

rarely beon a minute or two late, and in recent meetings--presumably
because he feels that Rodigast's never-failing appearance on the
precise second of the meeting must mean that this is required KUBARK
practice-- he has been even more precice. Rodigast is always ready
with a suggested solution to a security or other problem which will be
faced by Q in carrying out a new assignment.

On the other hand, part of Q's satisfaction with KUBARK might
derive from a feeling that KUBARK is a "soft touch". Rodigast does
not recomend that anything be done to change Q's opinion (if he really
does hold it); Rodigast feels that we are going to pay Q as much whether
he likes us or doesn't, and for the same money we might as well make
sure he likes us and will do his utmost for the organization rather
than simply be a timeserver keeping up appearances. If given cause
for resentment, his behavior is unpredictable, For he hasn't much to
lose-- reputation for loyalty, good name, etc. One solution would be
to give him enough so that he would indeed stand to lose much.

Q appears to possess a realitsic, sane view of ODI, what
its people are like, what can and can't be done by it. As already
indicated, he seems to be as loyal a FBPRCER as other people who don't
give much thought to the matter, certainly a lot more loyal than his
background would lead one to expect. In any case, we have no
recent evidence to contradict his statement that he considers himself
to be a loyal PBPRIDER; it may just be true. If it isn't, this won't
make any difference to the project as it is understood by Rodigast.

Q is unlikely to hold sympathetic feelings for CDEMY, having
had what he described as an unfortunate experience or two with thea.
On the other hand, he is sophisticated enough to assume that his
reporting on PBPRERS is of concern to ODLY, and he must know
that his own suggestion for tdy in PBPRIE to contact target
instititions and old friends there would put him into ODENVY territory.
He would probably accept any necessary collaboration without showing
that he didn't like it.

E. Rodigast does not believe Q is at present working for another
service, but it is difficult to know what would happen if another
service approached him. Rodigast assumes he would report this to us,
just as he reported in detail the overtures by two persons apparently
working with the services of the country in which he resides. As part
of the present operation involves the possibility that Q will in fact
be approached by the opposition, and Q is aware of this, one assumes
he is prepared to remain loyal to KUBARK; one would also assume he would
recognize the heightened value of his services to us should he be
approached by the other side and continue to remain loyal to us.

Q certainly would not agree to work for an opposition service
for peanuts, but if offered a considerable sum of money (given that
he just breaks even in his present arrangement with us, in the
thinking of Q's wife), there is no telling what he would do. When
recruited, Q was told he would get a raise once he got settled "in place"
(to $800), and when this promise is kept he will have enough extra
money to begin to pay debts and buy clothing, and thus have more
concrete evidence of the material advantages of his present arrangement.
Rodigast would be very surprised if Q agreed to work for an
opposition service not for financial reasons but through ideology.
Q likes to live well. He believes in wearing good clothes,
staying in good hotels, being able to invite others out for food and

drink. He says that in the revolutionary movement poverty is no virtue, but merely indicates lack of influence. He says that the most popular persons are those who can dispense money, alcohol, and women. .his may well be true. It is certainly true that such a role would please Q immensely (that is, having a plush apartment in which he could entertain terget personalities, satisfying KUBAPK's requirements and his personal desires).

F. Q must be dealt with firmly, with continued serving of requirements and planned itineraries for trips. At the same time, it is obvious that he improvises well when left without instructions; he is versatile, and can create situations which will result in an intelligence product. Rodigast's method is to suggest reasonable plans and to be ready to show that they can be implemented, and how they can, anticipating objections.

While there is no evidence that if left alone Q would drift, dragging out an assignment to ill time, it is possible that he would. He has not written as many free-iance articles as Fodigast would have liked him to, because each requires thinking out a subject, gathering material, selecting a point of view and thinking of the public to which it would be addressed-- a lot of work for articles meant to ser mainly as cover, for publication in obscure organs, or perhaps merely to be used to convince editors that he was active. On the other hand, he produced the first issue of the newsletter in record time, following instructions to the letter (indeed, accepting what must at times seem like petty editorial changes made by Rodigast). Perhats he produced the latter so efficiently because he saw in it added prestige, an opportunity to get his name back before the public in a respectable context.

Ideological motivation would not seem to be a level of control in his case. what is most important is his contentment with being (he hopes) a permanent part of a large organization, with a steady salary (he has never said this, of course); the power of ODY.E is less important than its known reputation for keeping its promise to pay, something one doesn't find anong the opposition groups known to Q, and he finds new examples of this daily.

Doubtless, his tendency to bear a grudge is a factor here-- Q is now in a position where he can thumb his nose at some of his enemies.

Rodigast feels that considerate dealing with Q, letting him know where he is going, what he can expect, not changing the rules abruptly or pulling a rug from under his feet, letting himssee the possibility of small but certain increases in zaterial benefits in the course of his career, compose the ideal commula for handling him. In the course of time, the ideological factor, which is perhaps marginal at this time, would probably be reinforced, could one way be a major factor. Q, meanwhile, must feel that the persons who deal with him are concerned with his material wellbeing and also of his physical safety, appre iating the risks in his work and understanding that not all assignments will bear fruit. Our relationship with Q could be destroyed very rapidly if we failed to pay him as promised, or wasted his time with make work, or cane him confusing or contradictory instructions which suggested that KUBARK was not the all-powerial institution he may now think it is.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

G. Very early in our relationship said that he would like
to make a career in KUBARK, outside now, perha a inside some day. He
would work in PBPRIL, or abroad. There was no indication then, and
has been none since, that he regards the present relationship as a
distasteful one to te terminated as soon as conditions permit.
He would like to settle in en expatriate's paradise, such as
Paris or one, presumably involved in journalism and other writing.
If he could do these things in connection with his work for us, so
much the better.

H. Qis conscious of the need for security and handles himsel: well--
as well as an amateur could in this context. But he is far more naive
about techniques and especially the nuances of technique than Rodigast
would have expected in one who had been involved in the revolutionary
movement for so long. He often needs instruction on obvious points,
and responds quite well to it, the exception being his clumsy handling
of the s/s method-- he is an intellectual and not a tecnician, ani
Rodigast assumes that he (Rodigast) would not do much better, if forced to
use some technical system.

Qis quite observant. He will recall a personal remark made to
him by Roaigast from one month to the next. His reports written some time
after the event are thorough and apparently accurate.

He read A Spy and His Master by Christopher Felix, and has
mentioned it a couple of times when a remark by Roiigast reminds him
of something sai in the book.

Roiigast doesn't think that even after training Q would be very
good at throwing off surveillance (for example) as he seems too matter
of fact to be sly, and perhars slightly lazy about what might be
gratuitous behavior (e.g., changing subway trains or taxis just on the
assumption that someone might be following hin). Rodigast's solution
is not to depend on for such things, but to attempt to plan nesting
and stage other operations so as to ninimize the need for dependence
on Q's skill in such areas. After patient briefing does understand
the need for tradecraft efficiency, and as already notei he follows
the advice.

I. At first Q qas quite concerned about money- he needed an
advance for clothes, for travel, etc. His requests were really plaints,
and he may have left the impression that he thinks of nothing but money.
It was the complex of a poor boy who never had anyone he could turn to-
despite a scholarship he had to leave a fine college alter a brilliant
freshman year. Once he received his advance and began receiving his money
at the begiming rather than at the end of each month, and when he
realizza that he would, receive complete and prompty reimbursement of
expenses, he began to relax. Now he submits accountings without
himself totalling the figures or keeping his om record (Podigast knows
this for he has seen Q's notes), so he must rely on us to tell him how much
he claimed for (even Rodigast would never do that). He is, in sum, relaxed.

The same ease is to be noted in his substantive work; he submits
his reports knowing he has done his best, and cone well; he accepts
compliments with a very slight nod. When nodigast first met Qin a hotel
room, Q had something of the hunted man. He still seens barried, slightly
nervous at the moment of contact, but on the whole he is nore sure of
himself.

At the outset, Q would argue about assig ments, suggesting
alternatives, worrying about not having time to buy tickets, or enough
money to pay for them. Now he accepts instructions without a murmur,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 203

even when they contradict a previous tentative plan. His excellert response to amicis day by his desire to please, his satisfaction with his job, or personal pride in accomplishment. Whatever the reason or reasons, the fact is that he does respond well.

SUBJECT Assessment of QREBONY

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

See below

It would prove very useful to us--both as a contribution to the preparation of the Project Outline now in progress and as a backgrounder for possible discussions of QREBONY's operational utilization--if RODIGAST could provide us with an interpretive assessment of him based on the impressions and judgements he has been able to develop over the past months. We have some such initial assessments, of course, and can infer more from current reporting. However, we would like to get the benefit of RODIGAST's unique and direct contact, now that QREBONY has passed through a breaking-in phase and settled down in a regular relationship which, at its inception, is certainly a difficult one for most people to adjust to. We would suggest the following outline of topics for RODIGAST to follow:

A. Estimate of loyalty to ODYOKE and QREBONY's psychological adjustment--his comfortableness--in working for ODYOKE clandestinely: his attitude, as RODIGAST can infer it, toward targets hostile to ODYOKE: in short, his ideological motivation.

B. Estimate of his motivation generally: his personal reasons for association with KUBARK.

C. Psychological suitability and staying power in leading a "double life". Possible or actual strains on him by virtue of his wife's attitude. Qualms about the "morality" of his position or fears about being found out.

D. His own views of his patriotism or loyalty. His attitude toward RODIGAST, KUBARK, ODYOKE and ODENVY.

E. His susceptability to approach or control by an opposition service.

F. Methods of control to which he is mort, and least, responsive. What represents the effective lever of his control--internal ideological

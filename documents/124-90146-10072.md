February 11, 1972

Re: Arab Terrorist Activities

The following information was furnished by a confidential source abroad on February 4, 1972:

According to the source, a pro-Palestinian organization called the Palestine Committee-Brussels was organized during 1970 within the Belgian National Palestine Committee for the purpose of supporting Palestinian revolutionary activities. The Brussels Committee was headed by Luc Dupire, a Belgian national born on April 9, 1942, at Haine St. Paul, and the National Palestine Committee by Aron Raindorf, a Belgian citizen born on December 22, 1919, at St. Gilles.

Following a period during which the two groups worked in harmony, a schism took place in November, 1971, which resulted in a new group being formed by Dupire and Yvonne Sterck which was called The Responsible Group for the National Palestinian Committee and the Palestinian Committee-Brussels without other members of either group being consulted. Raindorf, according to the source, is currently attempting to regain control over divergent elements and to restore order to the groups involved.

In this connection, Raindorf traveled to London where he remained from December 26 through December 28, 1971, and met with one Gibson, described only as an American Negro journalist and with an individual known as Manchanda, described as being of Pakistani origin. The source indicated Manchanda is probably identical to Albert Manchanda, a British citizen born on April 9, 1919, in India. Raindorf also traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, on January 20, 1972, and to Damascus, Syria, to meet with elements of the Fath and the O.L.P. which were not further described by the source.

The "New York Times" on 3/24/61, in an article entitled "US Asks Court Bar Questions On Castro Foes in Miami Area", by Peter Kihss, reported that an unidentified US agency had intervened in a murder trial in Miami asking that questions about activities by Cubans in that area seeking the overthrow of Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba be barred in the trial. The article stated that the above intervention became known while the FPCC called for a Congressional investigation of CIA. Richard Gibson, acting national secretary of the FPCC, said he based his call on an announcement of a "Revolutionary Council" set up by the two major anti-Castro groups in Miami. Gibson said there had been reports of CIA support of an anti-Castro enterprise and that forces had been using Florida as a training and staging point for attacks against Cuba. He said that reckless CIA action could lead the country into a major war.

The State Department advised that on 1/10/63, March Schleifer,
an American Marxist and journalist, provided information pertaining
to the formation of "Revolutionary Africa (RA)", a magazine which was
an organ of the Politbureau in Algeria. The editor of the English
language section was to be Richard Gibson. Schleifer had worked with
Gibson in the FPCC movement but had lost some of his confidence in
Gibson as a true revolutionary after the latter "jumped" at a bureaucratic
position with the Politbureau. Schleifer had lived with Gibson in
Algiers and regarded him as the same type of man that Djilas (not
further identified) had denounced in "The New Class" (not further
identified). Gibson's position with the Maspero (not further identified)
group, and thus the FLN (not further identified), predated his
involvement in Cuban affairs. Schleifer pointed out that long before
the Cuban revolution, Gibson had been working in France with the French
"neo-Marxist" left. He had considerable editorial ability and should
have been an asset to "RA".

The following references in the file captioned "Lee Harvey Oswald" set forth information pertaining to the activities of Richard Thomas Gibson during the period March, 1960 through 12/9/63, in New York, Algeria, Cuba, France and Switzerland. Gibson, a journalist, had been head of the FPCC in the US and reportedly was a possible link between the FPCC and the Chinese communists. He worked as a journalist in Cuba and later in Algeria where he reportedly worked for the Algerian Government. From a reported conversation between Gibson and another individual in Switzerland there appeared a possible indication that Gibson had been acquainted with Oswald. Gibson was interviewed at the American Embassy, Paris, where he stated that he had no correspondence or knowledge of Oswald under the latter's full name. However, he had received a letter from one Lee Bowmont who had indicated an interest in organizing a FPCC in Ft. Worth, Texas, who possibly was Oswald. Oswald allegedly had been connected with the FPCC. The interviewer suspected that Oswald's pictures may have looked familiar to Gibson.

The following references in the file captioned "Robert Alexander Wood" set forth information pertaining to the activities of Richard Gibson during the period late 1959 through 2/3/64, in the United States, New York, Cuba, Europe, England, France, Switzerland and Algeria. Wood provided information pertaining to Gibson beginning with his first meeting in 1959 with Gibson when he offered his services to the FPCC. Wood, accompanied by Gibson's wife, left the US for Algeria where Gibson was editor of the publication "Revolution Africaine". Wood lived with Gibson in Algeria. According to Wood, after Gibson arrived in France he tried to get funds from the French CP without success and was embittered against the "comrades". Wood did not believe Gibson was a member of the CPUSA or any CP, but was an opportunist who rode high on which ever cause he could find. He believed Gibson could have been recruited for a good salary. Later Gibson was reportedly living in Switzerland where he was active among pro-Chinese communist elements. Further details set out.

This reference in the file captioned "Deserters" pertains to an article which appeared on 3/20/68 in "Tidsignal", a leftist newspaper in Sweden, entitled "This is How LBJ's Agents Operate in Sweden" by Bo Hammer (not further identified). The article concerned alleged activities of US agents in Sweden to persuade American deserters in Sweden to return to the Army. It alleged that Richard Gibson, who professed himself to be a journalist and pretended to belong to the Black Power movement had been instrumental in persuading Ray Jones, one of the first deserters from the US Army in Sweden, to return to Frankfurt. Gibson, who lived in London, Eng., was said to have visited Sweden no less than four times and on his lasttrip had claimed to represent American Negro leader Robert Williams who was in China. According to the article Gibson's main interest at that time seemed to have been Jones. Jones' relationship with Gibson and attempts by the deserters to unmask American agents in Sweden were set out including their contacting Gibson in London for that purpose. Details set out.

In connection with a claim by the American Deserters Committee, Sweden, that agents for the CIA had tried to infiltrate the committee to break it up, it was determined at CIA that Richard Thomas Gibson, an informant of that Agency, had been maintaining some contact with US deserters. Gibson had been involved in at least one operation to influence a deserter to return to the US. Gibson also had been used by CIA throughout Europe as a penetration of Black Power and New Left groups and had been the source of considerable information from CIA. The impression had been received that Gibson had possibly been compromised and it could not be discounted that his involvement might become publicized including the allegation of a connection with CIA.

BY COURIER

1 - Mr. D. Ryan

![Sugar (R)]

Reference is made to your informal memorandum dated October 29, 1970, (your reference 0-44) enclosing 29 reports covering contacts of Sugar during his visit to the United States, September 24, 1970, to October 11, 1970.

In accordance with your request, the following comments on and evaluations relating to the validity and usefulness of the information in the reports are set forth:

1.  Sugar's recent presence in the United States was reported by two sources of this Bureau. These sources expressed no suspicions relating to his activity or cover.

2.  Based upon preliminary review, the information provided by Sugar appears accurate and generally conforms to information independently reported by our sources. Slight distortions noted were in accord with existing rumor or "talk" within domestic movement circles.

3.  The information provided by Sugar is considered of good intelligence value, but not in itself of high or exceptional value. It confirms and supports information developed by Bureau sources and in several instances provides current assessments and useful investigative leads.

4.  Sugar's obvious close association with Richard Ward (indicated in reports S-52 and S-56) would appear to offer him an opportunity to establish a stringer relationship with the weekly New York City left-oriented "Guardian," in the event this is in accord with the projection of his cover. Ward, in spite of criticism of the "Guardian," continues to be included as a staff member in the publication's masthead and his articles continue to be published. Although the "Guardian" has a United Kingdom address (13 Wood Ride, Orpington, Kent), no London correspondent is listed in its masthead. Both

Ward and Wilfred Burchette (current "Guardian" Paris repre-
sentative) have obvious close contacts with the Democratic
Republic of North Vietnam representation in Paris and would
appear to be in a position to provide an entree for Sugar
to the North Vietnamese.

5. The detailed information furnished by Sugar
   relating to Ward (report S-56) suggests Ward as a likely
   candidate for approach. Our files indicate Sugar has been
   acquainted with Ward since 1967. We would very much appreciate
   receiving a current personality assessment of Ward by Sugar.

Your interest in referring the reports of Sugar to
this Bureau is appreciated.

NOTE:

Sugar is CIA cryptonym for Richard Gibson who operates
in behalf of CIA from London, furnishing coverage of European
and Third World New Left and black extremists. The 29 reports
furnished by the Agency on 10/29/70 covering Sugar's contacts
while in the U.S. from 9/24-10/11/70 have been disseminated to
appropriate field offices and Bureau files by Bulet 11/9/70,
captioned "Richard Thomas Gibson, Information Concerning,"
Bufile 105-93072.

Richard Ward is included on the Security Index of
the New York Office and he is a current staff member of the
"Guardian" He was in contact with the North Vietnamese
Diplomatic Mission in Paris in 5/70 and traveled thereafter
to Hanoi and Laos for a five-week visit. According to the
information made available by Sugar, Ward is critical of the
"Guardian," the Soviets, and members of the New Left in this
country. He is currently doing research on a book about
American-Vietnamese relations and he claims this book will be
scholarly, other than a propaganda piece. Based upon a current
assessment of Ward by the Agency, we will consider interviewing
him, looking towards his development as an informant.

Classified "Secret" because incoming so classified,
and because it relates to sensitive CIA source compromise of
whom could cause serious damage to defense interests.

On 9/26/70 RICHARD GIBSON called CG 6547-S and his wife,
CG 6548-S at the informants' home who suggested to him that they
meet at a downtown restaurant for lunch. GIBSON readily agreed.
Informants spent about an hour with him. He told them that he was
in Chicago to attempt to get on the payroll of "Tuesday Magazine,"
a Black oriented weekly newspaper supplement, as an overseas
correspondent. GIBSON indicated to the informants that he planned
to travel to Detroit on 9/27/70 to meet with ROBERT WILLIAMS, and
thereafter go to New York City. He did not mention that he would
travel to San Francisco or any other US cities.

The informants and GIBSON discussed the civil war in
Jordan. GIBSON commented that the move by King HUSSEIN against
the Palestine Liberation Movement was the result of the policies.

of peaceful co-existence. He also assessed the outcome of the Jordanian crisis as a defeat for the guerilla forces under YASSIR ARAFAT.

GIBSON mentioned to the informants that he had recently been in Amman, Jordan where he spoke with GEORGE HABASH, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. GIBSON indicated that HABASH was a strong leader; whereas, ARAFAT was weak and prone to compromise.

GIBSON mentioned that DAVIDA FINEMAN a leader of the Revolutionary Union stopped in Belgium (probably in January, 1970) enroute home from the Palestine Liberation Conference held in Algiers, Algeria in December, 1969 where she contacted SERGE (Possibly SERGE PAIROUX, a Belgium communist) in an effort to purchase some firearms. According to GIBSON, SERGE would not assist FINEMAN in obtaining the firearms because she mentioned the name of RENE RAINDORF, a Belgium communist who has been active in the cause of Palestine Liberation. GIBSON claimed that RAINDORF is known in left circles in Europe "as CIA."

GIBSON asked the informants if he could meet with CG 7262-S whom he had met in Algiers last December. He was infants

On the evening of 9/26/70 GIBSON met CG 7262-S at a Chicago bar where informant is employed part-time as a bartender. Due to the circumstances under which they met, it was difficult for the informant to carry on an extended conversation with GIBSON. However, GIBSON did tell the informant the same story concerning his reason for being in his intention traveling to Detroit to see ROBERT WILLIAMS; his visit to Amman, Jordan; and the fact that he met during the day with the other two informants. GIBSON did not indicate that he would visit with BERGMAN or FINEMAN; however, he told the informant that BERGMAN and FINEMAN visited him in England as they were returning to the United States from the Palestine Liberation Conference in Algiers.

Dear Herb and Comrades,

Just a hasty note to let you know that Ren√© and Gilbert have recently returned from Amman with news about the desperately critical situation there. Nevertheless, we believe the situation is excellent for the revolutionary forces, despite the seemingly crushing weight of the reactionary, imperialist forces.

Throughout Europe, initiatives are being made by comrades, especially in regard to Arab embassies, needling them or coaxing them to show solidarity with the Palestinians or demonstrating against the most reactionary (e.g. the Jordan Embassy here was occupied by students yesterday). Cables, letters and personal calls are being made to Arab governments and their diplomats throughout Europe, and the Iraqi and Syrians shamed for their inactivity, despite all their past verbal support of the Palestinian Revolution. It would be especially useful for you.comrades in the States to inform Ren√© and me of any activity that you are engaged in on Palestine and please send us for republication texts of any statements, cables, etc.

Manu and Diane send you fraternal greetings. They are now married, by the way, and await reinforcement in the revolutionary ranks in December!

There is a possibility I might make it to the States sometime this fall. If so, I will try to come to Chicago to give you a first-hand report on the situation in these parts, as well as the Middle East.

Fraternally yours,

Reference is made to your informal memorandum dated September 14, 1970, relating to Sugar's intended visit in the United States during the period September 20 - October 18, 1970.

This Bureau desires to be advised of all pertinent contacts of possible investigative or intelligence interest to this Bureau that are made by Sugar during his travel in the United States.

For ready reference purposes and for possible assistance in the direction of Sugar in this country and abroad, there is enclosed a list of individuals associated with the Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Society who are presently in a fugitive status, and a list of black extremist fugitives. Any information Sugar may develop relating to the whereabouts of any of these individuals would be of value to this Bureau.

RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON
INFORMATION CONCERNING
(RESEARCH SECTION)

Captioned individual, a Negro male, who was formerly active in the U.S. as a leader of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, currently serves as a CIA informant based in England. He operates under the cover of "overseas representative and correspondent" for "Negro Press International," which is allegedly a Chicago-based firm. From his residence in London, Gibson furnishes coverage of European and Third World New Leftists and black nationalists.

CIA has advised Gibson will be in the U.S. for consultations with the Agency, during the period 9/20-10/18/70. During this period it is anticipated Gibson will visit New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Philadelphia to visit old contacts and to "become reacquainted with the scene in the United States."

From past experience, Gibson may be expected to endeavor to contact Negro militant activists in all the above cities, and specifically he will probably be in contact with the pro-Chicom Revolutionary Union in San Francisco and Leibel Bergman and Davida Fineman who are associated with this organization. He very likely will endeavor to contact the Ad Hoc Committee for a Marxist-Leninist Party, USA, in Chicago and members of the Republic of New Africa in Detroit and Philadelphia. He has been closely associated with Robert Franklin Williams in the past and may be expected to endeavor to contact him in Detroit.

RE: RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON SECRET

In the event the presence of Gibson comes to the attention of recipient offices, the Bureau should be promptly furnished all details, but no specific inquiries or investigation should be conducted. The Identity of Gibson is afforded highly compartmentalized security within CIA and under no circumstances should any local CIA representatives be furnished any information regarding Gibson or his activities.(S)

NOTE: Gibson operates for CIA under the cryptonym "Sugar." He has traveled to the U.S. on similar missions in the past and, as in the past, we are instructing the Agency by separate communication we desire to be advised the results of any contacts he makes in the U.S.(S)

May 5, 1970

RICHARD GIBSON

Reference is made to your memorandum dated April 20, 1970, your reference I-216, requesting the source of an article from the February, 1970, edition of the London publication, "Synic," relating to subject, which was forwarded to you by routing slip dated April 4, 1970. [^5]

This article was obtained by our Legal Attache, London, presumably from a review of the public press.

It is noted in December, 1969, Leibel Bergman, the theoretical leader of the militant Maoist San Francisco-based Revolutionary Union, according to a source who has furnished reliable information in the past, indicated shortly after meeting Gibson he distrusted him because of Gibson's reputed affiliation with the Central Intelligence Agency. At this time, Davida Fineman, also a member of the Revolutionary Union (and the former paramour of Gibson), defended Gibson, repeatedly stating the charges against him were unfounded and the "same old stuff." Nevertheless, Bergman at the time persisted in his suspicion of Gibson. [^5]

As a matter of additional interest, in February, 1970, Bergman commented that during his travel the previous month abroad, he had met with Gibson in London and stayed overnight at the Gibson residence. At this time, Bergman stated he found Gibson to be charming, likable, sophisticated, intelligent, but hung-up on a feeling of self-importance. Bergman described Gibson as doing "good work," but stated Gibson is not as important as he believes. [^5]

From the above it would appear Bergman, who may be described as an astute tactical Marxist-Leninist, now accepts Richard Gibson. Any additional pertinent information believed to be of interest to you regarding the activities of Richard Gibson will be promptly made available [^5]

DANGER - AMERICAN AGENT AT WORK

Many people on the left tend to get a little paranoiac about the C.I.A., and to suspect absolutely everyone. There is, however, one person who moves around in the British left who should be avoided - it is just a little more than coincidental that so many people and organisations abroad seem to think that he is working for the Americans.

His name: RICHARD GIBSON. He is a black American, and he works for NEGRO PRESS INTERNATIONAL, itself not totally above suspicion. Gibson speaks in Marxist-Leninist-Maoist terminology, and pretends to be no more than this. He produces a monthly bulletin, called 'RICHARD GIBSON reports', which carries a lot of information about those Southern African movements which are not fighting, like the PAC of South Africa, and ZANU of Rhodesia. He also carries, in this bulletin, smears about other movements, suggesting that they are lackeys of Israel, or terrorists or not revolutionary.

Gibson is believed to be a CIA agent by most of the Southern African groups, by the Black Panthers, by the Palestinians, et. al. He used to work with a magazine in Algiers, but he was sacked, and the magazine printed an explanation saying he was CIA. Similarly, he lost his tie with 'Jeune Airique' after they found him having contacts with US Embassy officials. Even Jordanian diplomats, who are not unknown for their US links, have been known to volunteer the information that Gibson is CIA.

He works from Britain : SYNIC suggests that he should be watched with care. And his associates here should not be forgotten either. SYNIC will be covering a couple of them in future issues.

1. A sensitive source has reported that Leibel BERGMAN and Herb BLOCK share a deep detestation of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP). BLOCK stated that he was convinced the PLP was directly run by the CPUSA and that he (BLOCK) learned that Fred JEROME's mother, Alice JEROME (a prominent member of the PLP) had secretly attended a Party school in the Soviet Union after being publicly associated with the PLP.

2. The main reason that BLOCK and his wife wanted to visit China was to continue denunciations of the PLP. BLOCK is convinced that his previous communications with the Chinese about PLP had had some effect and that the PLP would shortly be "derecognized" by the Chinese.

(7) NOTE: Gibson, a former leader of the Fair Play For Cuba Committee in the United States, has been operated for a number of years in Europe by CIA under the cryptonym "Sugar." The Agency has targeted him against Negro nationalist and pro-Chicom elements and, as a result, his path has frequently crossed the paths of our informants operating under the AHC cover. Chicago is aware of Gibson's CIA involvement. Purpose of this inquiry is to determine if Gibson has any actual ties in Chicago area which could conflict with AHC

For the current information of the Bureau and recipient office, the following, derived from review of subject's passport file by SA GERARD C. CARROLL at the Passport Office, U. S. Department of State on 1/2/70, is being set forth. Mrs. SHIRLEY ABBOUD, Foreign Operations Division of the Passport office, had notified SA KENNETH J. HASER that subject had recently obtained a new passport in London, England.

Passport Z-1057628 (valid until 11/9/74) was issued to the subject at London, England, on 11/10/69. In an affidavit, also dated 11/10/69, to E. T. VANGAS, U. S. Consul in London, subject claimed that on 13/8/69, after passing the French exit immigration control at Orly Airport, he apparently dropped his passport Z-414374„ÄÇ British immigration authorities permitted him to land, upon production of his "home office certificate of registration G 662567". Subject added that Air France later reported that his passport was not found at Orly. In requesting a new passport, subject explained that he was scheduled to fly to Brussels on the morning of 11/12/69.

In his application for the above passport, subject listed his address as 32 Hartswood Road, London, ENGLAND indicating that his wife, JOY MY GIBSON, resided with him at this address. He advised that his travel plans were indefinite and that he intended to reside abroad for business reasons.

Subject's passport file contained a communication
from the American Embassy in Bern, Switzerland to the
State Department, dated 1/23/68. It reported that subject,
who was traveling by train from Milan to Geneva with his
wife, was removed from the train by Swiss immigration
authorities on 1/20/68 at Brig. Subject's wife contacted
the American Embassy by phone from Brig requesting direct
intervention with the Swiss. It was subsequently ascertained
from a responsible Federal Foreigners Police (FFP) officer
that the subject had been expelled from Switzerland on
9/12/63 for his political activity and association with the
magazine, "La Revolution Africaine". On 12/16/63, the
Bundesanwaltschaft (Federal Police and Justice Department)
issued an order prohibiting subject's re-entry into
Switzerland. However, since his whereabouts were unknown,
notification of same could not be sent to the subject.
The FFP officer stated that if the subject had applied
for entry into Switzerland during the week instead of the
weekend, he might have been authorized limited entry.
According to this officer, the subject should write to the
Bundesanwaltschaft in Bern concerning the incident at Brig
and request that he be furnished a reason for it. He would
then receive a copy of their order and would have opportunity
to appeal the decision within 30 days. [^1]

As stated in the above communication, subject's
wife affirmed that the subject had made several trips to
Switzerland subsequent to 1963 without any difficulties.
She claimed she intended to protest to the International
Press Institute concerning the Swiss authorities. [^2]

SECRET

In view of this latest development, it is most strongly urged that the Bureau, through liaison, have CIA interview "SUGAR" specifically concerning the following points:

(1) Any and all knowledge "SUGAR" has concerning activities and contacts of HOWARD BRUCE FRANKLIN while the latter was in France:

(2) Any and all knowledge of DAVIDA FINEMAN. In this connection, it is suggested that CIA be requested to encourage correspondence between "SUGAR" and FINEMAN..

(3) "SUGAR" furnish CIA with all correspondence to and from the RU and that "SUGAR" be directed in a logical way to encourage such correspondence with the RU.

In view of LEIBEL BERGMAN's admitted difficulties over communications with Red China and lack of knowledge of current events in that country, it is believed that if "SUGAR" can favorably establish himself with the RU as a contact in Europe he will be able to furnish valuable information on any other contacts the RU may attempt to establish on the Continent and might even be utilized as a cutout by BERGMAN for the RU.

In view of the delicate nature of the information contained in the LHM, the Bureau may wish to restrict dissemination to CIA only.

In referring the above requests to CIA, the Bureau should insure the bona fides of "SUGAR" as a CIA operative and his reliability lest SF 3169-S be compromised.

San Francisco will continue to follow this matter with SF 3169-S.

### RICHARD GIBSON
INFORMATION CONCERNING

In June, 1969, a confidential source, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised that at an Executive Committee meeting of the Revolutionary Union (RU) held on June 8, 1969, DAVIDA FINEMAN read a letter which she had received from RICHARD GIBSON, whom she described as a Negro who resides in Europe and whom she knew while she was in France. This letter was a run-down on the Marxist-Leninist-Mao groups in various countries in Europe and described some of these groups as revisionists who support the new working class, e.g. technicians and other highly skilled labor, and support a broad united front which would include various members of the bourgeoise.

According to this source, BRUCE FRANKLIN in no uncertain terms described GIBSON as a CIA agent who was exposed as such and had to flee France lest he be killed. FRANKLIN stated that he had proof of GIBSON's affiliation with CIA. LEIBEL BERGMAN, on the other hand, stated in no uncertain terms that BRUCE FRANKLIN's allegation was completely untrue and that GIBSON had been thoroughly checked out when BERGMAN, himself, was in Red China and had been found to be all right. BRUCE FRANKLIN continued the argument by stating that he could prove that GIBSON was a CIA agent because some friends of his in France had been exposed and arrested shortly after their introduction to GIBSON.

At the Executive Committee meeting, it was decided that LEIBEL BERGMAN and the FRANKLINS were to iron out their differences about GIBSON amongst themselves and it was further decided that the RU may be in contact with GIBSON.

REVOLUTIONARY UNION,
ALSO KNOWN AS
RED UNION BAY AREA
REVOLUTIONARY UNION

In September, 1968, a source advised that the Revolutionary Union, commonly known to its membership as the Red Union (RU), was formed in early 1968 as a covert, revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist organization ideologically oriented toward Communist China, which it views as the model of the correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line as developed through MAO Tse-tung. The PU advocates the necessity of violent revolution and open guerrilla warfare to overthrow the existing political system in the United States and effect radical changes in this nation, and some members are collecting firearms, explosives, and other weapons and have engaged in guerrilla warfare and firearms training. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the RU consists of three locals, one each in San Francisco, the East Bay, and the Peninsula.

In April, 1969, a second source advised that the RU partially surfaced during that month through advertisements in select "New Left" periodicals, identifying three members of the Executive Committee as public spokesmen and offering for sale select writings of the RU, including a "Statement of Principles," in the form of "The Red Papers." With the exception of the three publicly identified spokesmen, the general membership of the RU will remain covert; however, individual members are free to reveal their RU membership to close political associates as the necessities of political effectiveness dictate.

The RU's published "Statement of Principles" calls for the smashing of the existing state apparatus by the United States working class and the establishment of communism and the dictatorship of the proletariat; recognizes the necessity of violent revolution and organized armed struggle to achieve those ends and calls for the creation of a revolutionary party based upon Marxism-Leninism as developed through MAO Tse-tung.

ReCGlet 11/7/66 relating to correspondence dated 10/25/66 received at the Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) post office box from Richard Gibson.

For your confidential information, in the past the Central Intelligence Agency has prepared and widely disseminated bogus copies of "The Crusader," the publication of Robert F. Williams. For this reason, you should be most circumspect in citing Williams or his writings in connection with this intelligence operation. As previously authorized, Williams should be maintained on the AHC mailing list.

The material relating to Williams, forwarded to the AHC by Gibson, is interesting from an intelligence viewpoint and your prompt attention in forwarding it to the Bureau is appreciated.

ReCGairtel 11-12-68 speculating that Davida Fineman, Hodee Edwards, and Paul Richards, all of whom have been associated with the CIA source known as "Sugar," are affiliated with the CIA in an operation in this country.

Through Bureau liaison on 11-15-68, it was determined from CIA that the Agency has had no contact or connection, either direct or indirect, with Fineman, Edwards, and Richards and that these individuals are not under the direction of the Agency.

In connection with this operation and the investigation of the Revolutionary Union, Chicago and San Francisco should bear in mind the likelihood that Fineman and Richards may very likely be in current contact with the CIA source known as "Sugar" although there is no indication they have knowledge of the Agency's relationship with "Sugar."

CG 100-41353

Referenced communications concerning RICHARD GIBSON reflect that in 1966 former CG 5908-S, when in contact with pro-Chinese communists in Italy, was apprised of the suspicion of the Italians concerning RICHARD GIBSON, specifically that he was a CIA agent. In connection with their suspicions, the Italians requested the informant to check on one DAVIDA FINEMAN, who was ostensibly traveling with GIBSON as a translator. It was subsequently learned that FINEMAN was residing in Paris at that time but had been a resident of New York City. Referenced communications from New York and Los Angeles concerning FINEMAN identify her background. Chicago has no additional information concerning this person and does not, in fact, have sufficient knowledge to determine whether the person traveling with GIBSON in Europe in 1966 is identical with the DAVIDA FINEMAN who has emerged as part of the Revolutionary Union.

The Bureau and Los Angeles are requested to furnish to San Francisco any information which would assist in effecting an identification of this person, it being believed by Chicago that the definite possibility exists that the person traveling with GIBSON is in fact identical with the current member of the Revolutionary Union.

Chicago would desire to know when FINEMAN returned to the United States and if she has any recorded activities within left wing movements since returning. It would seem that her emergence in the Revolutionary Union is highly suspect in view of the probability of her former association with GIBSON. AS GIBSON's identity is known to the Bureau and the interested office, it would seem that the implications of a CIA operation are clearly apparent.

In this connection, San Francisco letter of 10/30/63 reflects that HODEE EDWARDS has apparently returned to the United States from England and San Francisco is presently attempting to verify her residence. In connection with EDWARDS, it will be recalled that she had written to the Ad Hoc Committee while a house guest of RICHARD GIBSON in London concerning some theoretical aspects of pro-Chinese ideology and that GIBSON, while in contact with CG 6547-S in Chicago, had furnished the

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

CG 100-41353

name of PAUL RICHARDS, son of EDWARDS, as a good person who had been active in the communist movement on the west coast. RICHARDS recently wrote to the Ad Hoc Committee expressing his favorable attitude toward the ideology as expressed by the Committee and the possibility exists, therefore, that he was prompted to do so on advice from his mother, HODEE EDWARDS.

The totality of these events suggest that CIA has effected operations in this country with the possible intent of attempting to arrange for travel to China, and Chicago strongly suspects not only FINEMAN but EDWARDS and RICHARDS as being part of these operations.

Chicago respectfully requests any information the Bureau may have in this matter.

DATE: 5/21/68

Re Bulet dated 10/20/67 concerning PAUL RICHARDS and Bulet 4/26/68 concerning M. I. LASKI.

Attached to each copy of this communication is a xerox copy of a letter dated 4/23/68 from RICHARD GIBSON to the AHC. This letter was furnished to SA ROBERT R. GLENDON by CG 6547-S on 5/8/68.

For information Milwaukee, GIBSON is referring to PAUL RICHARDS in the third paragraph of this letter. As Milwaukee may desire to utilize this information in report form such must be paraphrased and the source to identify the characterization as RICHARDS is CG 6547-S who met with GIBSON last year in Chicago. Milwaukee is requested to review Bulet dated 10/20/67 for instructions regarding the AHC. Chicago would also suggest that GIBSON's name not be used in any report.

The Bureau's attention is invited to the comment in paragraph two regarding M.I. LASKI and in particular that which notes that LASKI alligned himself with MIKE BAKER in London who now professes an anti-MAO. line. It would appear that LASKI in his headlong rush to gain international recognition has again created friends inimical to his own primary interests,

If the Bureau desires a fraternal letter to directed to GIBSON such will be promptly prepared.

23 April 1968

Dear Herb,

Please forgive my slowness in answering your letter of February 12. Much has been happening here, not all of it for the best, as far as I can see, but I still believe that the sharpening racial and class contradictions in Britain and elsewhere in Europe -- in recent weeks will provide an excellent situation in which Marxist-Leninists can work more vigorously than in the past here. But there still remain many other internal contradictions, personality conflicts, distorted reflections of the Cultural Revolution, etc. that must be resolved. I wish I could write in greater detail, but I am certain you understand, with your experience, far more than I do.

Concerning "Comrade" Laski, nothing further has been heard of him since he left here for Paris. His great comrade here, Mike Baker, who published a huge interview with Laski in his publication, Red Front, also took to attacking what he now calls "Mao's ultra-Left clique." Whether Laski approves of Baker's new anti-Mao line, I cannot say, but birds of a feather do flock together...

The person living with me that you mentioned in your letter is a lady, mother of the young student at the University of Wisconsin that you met at my hotel in Chicago when I was last there. He is still very much in the revisionist party, although deeply disturbed by its general reformist, not to say capitulationist line, yet still greatly swayed by some of the CPUSA tame intellectuals, particularly Apteker. I do wish you comrades might help him to understand the correct line and find a way forward.

Give my regards to your wife, who I trust has now completely recovered from her bout of poor health.

Fraternally yours,
Richard Gibson

## Memorandum

TO: Mr. D. J. Brennan, Jr.

FROM: S. J. Papich

SUBJECT: SUGAR

DATE: April 18, 1968

SUGAR is a cryptonym for Richard Thomas Gibson,
a U. S. Negro who has been utilized by the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) as an informant in foreign countries. He has been
a source of information relating to the New Left and Black
Power activities. His background is well known to the Bureau,
and we have always had some question concerning his reliability.

Recently, CIA reported that SUGAR had encountered
some difficulty in Sweden as a result of his efforts to
establish contact with American deserters in that country.

On April 17, 1968, Richard Ober confidentially
advised that the Dutch internal security service had con-
tacted CIA and was making an inquiry concerning SUGAR. At
this point, CIA does not know why the Dutch are making the
check, but the Agency is speculating that SUGAR's activities
in Europe have come to the attention of the Dutch. It is
Ober's opinion that CIA at some point will contact a top
official in the Dutch internal security service concerning
the Agency's interest in SUGAR.

Ober stated that in the event the Bureau receives
any inquiry from the Dutch concerning SUGAR, the Agency would
like to be contacted before we respond to the Dutch. In this
connection, he pointed out that Andries Kuipers of the Dutch
internal security service is scheduled to visit the U. S. in
the very near future and will be in contact with the Bureau.
CIA is speculating concerning the possibility of Kuipers
requesting information concerning SUGAR. Here again CIA asked
that we check with agency before we would respond.

ACTION: The above information is being directed to the
attention of the Nationalities Intelligence, Racial
Intelligence, Internal Security, and Foreign Liaison Sections.

FROM:

SUBJECT: SUGAR
Activities of Russell Stetler and John Cerassi, US Citizens

1.  The information below was acquired by SUGAR from a former employee of the London-based Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation (BRPF) who talked with Alan Krebs, an American leftist who is Director of the Free University in New York City and who is close to Russell Stetler and John Cerassi.

2.  Stetler spends most of his time travelling between the US and London to consult with Ralph Schoenman, Director of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation (BRPF) regarding the Foundation's activities. There are now only three officials in the BRPF. Stetler is undecided about his political future and is considering the possibility of returning to graduate school. Schoenman does not have inexhaustible BRPF funds at his disposal and sometimes there are great financial crises. At times Stetler is very bitter about Schoenman's methods of operation and often feels that the latter "sells down the river those who work for him".

3.  John Cerassi, a member of the International War Crimes Tribunal's first investigating team to North Vietnam in December 1966 and January 1967, was in Cuba the week of 3 July 1967. He is no longer on friendly terms with Ralph Schoenman, and apparently went to Cuba for a different reason than that of Schoenman, who was there in late June 1967.[^1]

4.  Cerassi told Krebs that he will publicly support the Tribunal, but that he is physically unable to work with Schoenman. It is due to the "fight" between the two individuals that Cerassi did not attend the First Session of the Tribunal in Stockholm which was held in early 1967.[^2]

5.  It is requested that no action be taken on the basis of this information without prior coordination with this agency.

1. Source Comment: While in London during the week of 17 July, Cerazal said he was en route to Havana where he was to be an observer at the Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO) Conference. Is believed the Cuban attitude has changed considerably in the past year and that the Moscow-leaning Communists are losing all their influence. The former repressive measures in Cuba against homosexuals, beatniks and other deviants have been dropped. Concerning the International War Crimes Tribunal, Cerazal appeared convinced that the Tribunal's Second Session will be held in Stockholm rather than in Copenhagen or some other city. He said that he will testify at the event in any case.

2. Field Comment: The First Session of the Tribunal was sponsored by the BRPF and was commonly referred to as the "Bertrand Russell War Crimes Tribunal". This designation however can no longer apply inasmuch as cumulative reporting, since the Stockholm meeting, indicates that the BRPF and the Tribunal are separate entities with independent motivation, direction and control. According to various sources, the Second Session of the Tribunal is scheduled to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark beginning 20 October 1967. It is not known whether or not the BRPF will support the Copenhagen event.

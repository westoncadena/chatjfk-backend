MEMORANDUM FORS: Chief, OS/Alien Affairs staff

ATTENTION: Mr. Pennington

SUBJECT: Extension of Time in ZI for REISOI Agent AEASPIC,
CI/OA No. C-73532.

REFERENCES: a. SR/DOB Memorandum 1463, dated 12 March 1959.
b. SR/DOB Memorandum 1730, dated 14 September 1959.

1. It is requested that an extension of time be arranged through your office to allow REISOI agent AEASPIC, who entered this country (black) 20 April 1959, to remain in the United States until about 20 April 1961. It is not envisaged that Subject will be required to remain in ZI throughout this entire period; however, such an extension will afford adequate time for implementation of operation AESENTINEL.

2. Close supervision as regards personal and social contacts of AEASPIC will, of course, be continued by an SR/DOB staff officer, until such time as Subject re-enters training when his status will revert to that as outlined in Reference a. (supervision by a staff officer on a 24-hour basis).

3. Subject is available at the convenience of your office should his visits to Immigration and Naturalization Offices be deemed necessary to effect this arrangement.

4. For any further information please contact Fred Kirkpatrick on Ext. 8331.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Status Report

In November 1959 Cover Branch assisted SR/DOB Case Officer Fred Kirkpatrick in formulating cover under which AESENTINEL agent AEASPIC could live and thus be released from 24-hour custody. AEASPIC was documented under the name David Durvard and was so registered by Alien Affairs Staff. AEASPIC carries a cover letter issued by Alien Affairs to this effect.

SR/DOB Case Officer Fred Kirkpatrick was documented (see below) under the name Fred K. Koner, a self-employed manufacturer's representative, presently engaged, with David Durvard, in adapting certain American automatic coin-operated vending machines to the French market, in particular in the Paris area. Mr. Dirvard is serving as Mr. Koner's engineer/technical advisor.

This arrangement has to date worked entirely satisfactorily, and it is hoped will continue to function until about mid June, when aforementioned cover arrangement should be discontinued owing to resumption of operational training. Fur further information, please contact Fred Kirkpatrick on Ext. 8331.

Ma Cocotte cherie.

Voici la deuxième lettre que je t'acris D'ailleurs ce n'est pas seulement à toi que j'ai envoye des lettres, mais aussi & non frere,au toubib et mon ex-belle soeur,et aussi aux geassches qui j'atais avant de vous quitter voici un an passé. J'avais dorit d'ici dès que j'avais pu le faire, c'est à dire il y a de cola trois mois environ.Je n'ai jamais reçu aucune réponse à l'adresse que j'avais donnée ! J'espere que cette-fois J'aurais plus de chance car il doit y avoir certainement une raison quelque-part. c. Comme c'est la mode ces tompa-gi, ou bien l'avion qui portait mes lettres s'est écrasé quélque-part,ou bien celui qui rapportait les reponses a fait la mawe chose,ou alors ce qui serait plus près de la verit,il n'y a jamais ou de reponse pour une raison qui m'échappe. Il est possible aussi comme je suis souvent en deplacement dans le pays ou mau on dehors, que lo courrier se soit envolé en fumée, les Jivaros al-ment Labre du feu de temps à autre.

Je vous racontais un tas de choses interessantes de pays que j'avais 13occasion de visiter, ayant sto un pou partout, mais comme je n'aime pas repeter les mêmes choses plusieurs fois, vous ne saures rien dutout si je n'ai pas de reponse à cette lettre aussi.

Je suis revenu seulement hier d'une promenade do dour mois dans le nord du pays. C'est plein de serpents et de poesilier Parmis les bresiliennes il y en a de vraiment chouettes ot de moins chouettes aussi.Il faut y gouter pour comprendre.Je parlo évidemment des breziliennes des grandes villes,parcoque quand on quitte la ville,ça fait plutôt Vesinet ea on aurait tendance dvouloir se payer une bouteille d'Airwick que d'y mettre le nes.

Il a fait un peu chaud sus temps-cl,c'est l'até pour cet hemisphère, et quand il pleut c'est de la vapeur qui vous descend sur le dos, mais avec un bon ventilateur, une douche froide et des boissons glacées,on arrive à ne pas fondre completament.

Je n'ai rien à faire en France, mais tu sale bion na Cocott que jo pense toujours à vous,od que je me trouve aussi mon idée est-elle de faire un saut pour vous voir, sono ne serait-ce quan instant, dda que cola me sera possible.

Que s'est-il passé ches vous depuis mon depart.Annika dû retrouver Titi, madame Bebert Monestier a certainement demena-géo. Nelly se met-elle toujours les doigts dans le nes? News50 ronchonne t'elle toujours. Et toi que fais-tu? Jaai oublié le nom du chien noir..ah oui, Opi le pisseur.

Et bien voilà, maintenant nous allons pärlor seriousement de penso que cette lettre va t'apporter de bonnes nouvelles, mais Je ne le ferais que si je suis certain d'avoir une reponse.Quand je l'aurai je t'enverral de l'argent d'abord pour te depanner et en suite parceque je vous aime, toi et les tiene. Des que locontact sera retabli jo vous feral parvenir ou te ferai parvenir tous les mois de quoi vous aider substantiellement et peut-stre plus. Bo que je te demande on echange c'est:

1o) d'envoyer aux personnes que j'ai citdes plus haut, juste un petit Bot pour donner mon now et ma nouvelle adresse exacte-ment comme celle-ci.81 plus al moins

2) de demander & Annick,d Hina ot & Belly de m'ecrire ai elle le veulent bien, cotte lettre esant aussi pour chacune d'elles et alles doivent certainement savoir combien cela ne ferait plaj-sir.

Katro temps les jours passeront et je viendrai vous voir, produbiczent en novembre ou on decembre.el je ne se case pea le queuie en route, les plerrea soat un peu pointues sur le che-ain on jo auta Alors je vous eshragaaral beaverip,beaucoup,tol Kamee, Aniak, ice, st na patio Nelly.

Dearest,
Here is the second letter that I'm writing you. You know, it's not only to you that I sent letters, but also to my brother, to the doctor, and to my former sister-in-law, and also to the people with whom I stayed before leaving you a year ago? I wrote from here as soon as I could, that is, three months from that time. I never received any reply at the address I gave? I hope that this time I will have more luckier, for there must certainly be some reason somewhere. As frequently happens these days, either the plane which was carrying my letters had an accident somewhere or the one which was bringing back the answers did the same thing (i.e. had an accident), or, more likely, truth, there never was an answer for some reason that escapes me. It is possible also, since I travel frequently throughout the country and even abroad, that the mail went up in smoke. The Givaros like to start fires from time to time.

I told you lots of things about the countries that I've had a chance to visit, having been almost everywhere, but, since I don't like to repeat the same things several times, you will find out nothing if I do not get an answer to this letter, too.

I just returned yesterday from a two month trip to the north of the country. It's full of snakes and brazilian women. Among the Brazilian women


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

there are some really cute ones, and less cute also. you have to taste thens to understand. Evidently, I'm speaking of the Brazilian women of the cities because when one leavce the city its more like Vasinet and one's reaction would be to buy a bottle of Airwick rather than stick his nose there.

It's been rather hot lately. It's summer in this hemisphere, and when it rains the steam goes down your back. But with a good fan, a cold shower, and iced drinks, one manages not to melt completely.

I'ul nothing te de in France, but you can be sure Honey that I'm always thinking of you wherever I may be. Therefore, my intentions is to take a short trip to see you, even if only for a moment, as soon as this is possible.

What's happened among you since my departure. Annik must have found Titi again, Madame Bebert Monefties has surely moved out. Does melly still put Ler fingers in his more? Does Memée still grumble? And you, what are you doing? I forgot the name of the black Loz - oh yas, Ops the pisser..

Will, row we are going to speak veriously and (2) think this letter is going to bring you good news, but I will not de so unless I'm sure of an answer. When I get one, I aily send you some morig te trai you over and thin because I love you, you and yours. Once contact is reestablished 2


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

will send you (plural) or rather, I will send you (singular) every month enough to help you substantially and perhaps more. What I ask in exchange is:
1) to send to the people I've mentioned above, just a little note giving my name and my new address exactly like this one. Neither more nor less.
2) to ask Annick, Nina, and Nelly to write me, if they will, this letter being also for each of theirs; and they must surely know how happy this will make me.

In the meantime the days will pass and I will come to see you, probably in November or December, unless I kill myself on the way, the rocks are rather sharp on the road I'm taking. Then I kiss you very very much, you, Annick, Nina, and my little Nelly.

(signed: Edward)

Dear Atchico,

I've been thinking for an hour and I still don't know how to begin. I can't say that as a brother I've especially been a blessing to you, and often I've caused you more trouble than I would have liked, directly or indirectly. My leaving Gap was inevitable. On the one hand because of the obligation to remain there until an indefinite date, and above all because of the work I'm now doing which had been in the offing for quite a while. My stay at Ambert had nothing to do with my departure; it it was only a business trip.

If I had been able to write you sooner, I would have done so. Now I can, and as there are many things in suspense I would be glad to be able to take them up where I've left them. I never expected you to bear the price of ry actions; therefore, I'm counting on you to tell me whom you paid for me, for I presume that most people immediately thought you were responsible for m debts. As soon as you reply, I will immediately send you the money to reimburse you, or, if need be, to pay the inter- ested party.

If you didn't already know, I'm notifying you that Jacqueline is first on my list and there is no reason why she should be deprived of what is hers. I could very well have sent her the money today, but I don't even know if this letter will arrive at the right address. It's more than a year since I left you, and I'm making contact again.

Next on the list ther's you naturally, whom I do not forget. Listen, what I ask is that you wrtie me seriously, for your sakė as well as mine. Give me the list of these people in order of urgency.

When I left Arbert, I had left instructions to pay certain people, and I don't know if this has been done. I'm going to write to the Dassauds, in this way, perhaps, I'll know what has happened.

I've been here a very short time and have had a lot to do in the past few months. Unfortunately I can't tell you where, when, or what kind of work. I only ask that you have faith in me.

How is life at Gap? How are the girls, Elico and Irene? I would be glad to receive a letter from them with a few pictures of all of you, if possible. Many regards to Jacqueline with hopes that she and hers are all well.

As far as "hers" are concerned, you know that I still have a picture of my Flack (moreover, it's my only family album) but she must have changed and must be a happy mother of many children, bitch that she was.

I kiss you all and expect a letter from you.

P.S. This is my address. Since I'm often away, take care to copy it correctly; your letter will be forwarded.

20 October 1959

Dear Kathela and Louis,

worm cut by a long trip... signed the PELICAN. Twenty thousand leagues under the sea, as many in the air, and here I am in cha-cha-cha land.

Rio (see Francis Carce) is a magnificent city. Principal industries: pleasure and love. If I were a brazilian I would have called this cit Loveland, (the French name is somewhat more eartily) this is, perhaps, less poetic than Rio de Janeiro sut more in the spirit of things. Louis would quickly make a fortune curing the flourishing cases of clap (vilgar French expression) and other little venereal cetails.

I'll be here for some time. I have a bit of were to finish in this country, on the order of hide and go seek. This is bound to take me a few weeks if not a few months. After that I think I'll be able to pay you a very short visit.

For the time being I am in Sao Paulo which is a city ever. more magnificent than te, and also larger. In the rovies you see Furt Lancaster and Brigitte Bardot spent a pure Portuguese. Sometime ago, the spoke derman flawlessly?

Here I a'r burdened with a row Janguage. It is very much like Spanish and I think I'll get used to it rather quickly, but everthing is beginning to get mixed up: English, German, Russian, French, Jecrgian, and Spanish. Long live Esperanto! If someday I go to China, I've had it.

Now you have a vague icea of what I've done in to now, and, besides, I'm not supposed to give my life's history.

I often think it would be good to see each other again to laugh a little and to take some haury trips around Marseilles. How are you and now are the girls? Elice, Irene, ana Jathy. I would love to have a line from each of them if their pen isn't too heavy. It's over a year since I've seen them. at the ceme time I'm writing to atchice, so that if atchico were to hear the giris speaking of me it home he will not be embarrassed or surprised. Shinking that now they have an American mele. Dat's good. nowever I haven't get a ranch jet, and bestars, even find the possibility to get che, it wouldn't termt me.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

How is Zouquette? and Sophie? I hope that you still see her and if so tell her that would really be happ to get a few lines from her, if she has no chiections. cions. Since I can't write her directly, you would be very bird to pass to her any answer I may write It's true that I am also a prac lien papa.

And pretty Eliene? Many regards to her. I don't care suggest that she write me. First, it's not polite, and then we would even- tually snap at each other again, but I believe tat I wouldn't.m mind being bitten by her. Ch well, I love to suffer. Hello to Dina, naturally.

You write re, I'll write you, and some day I'll return.

Sao Paulo le 29 Octobre 1959

Chers Nathels et Louis

Fatigue d'un long voyage.....signé le PELICAN

Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, autant dans les airs et me voila au Che-caa-chaland.

Rio (voir Francis Carco)est une ville magnifique principales industries:Les plaisirs et l'amour. J'aurais été presilien J'aurais appelé cette ville icilombaise.c'est peut-etre moins poetique que Rio de Janeiro mais plus dans le ton.

Louis ferait rapidement fortune a soigner de foisonnantes chaude-pisses et autres petits details veneriens.

Je suis ici pour quelques temps.J'ai un petit travail a terminer dans le pays dans le genre de coucou tu m'as vu,tu m'as pas vu, viens que je t'attrape.Cela me prendra certainement quelques semaines si ce n'est pas quelques mois.apres ca je pense pouvoir vous rendre une petite visite a toute vitesse entre deux coups de feu.

Pour l'instant je me trazs trouve a Sao Paulo qui une ville encore plus magnifique que Rio, et plus grande aussi.

Au cinema on voit Burt Lancaster et Brigitte Bardot parler un portugais sans melange. Il y a quelques temps deja, ils parlaient l'allemanding impecablement?

Me voici encombre d'une nouvelle langue. Cela ressemble fortement a l'espagnol et je pense m'adapter assez vite.mais tout commence par s'eabrouiller, anglais allemand russe francais georgien espagnol. Vive l'esperanto! Si un jour je vais en Chine je suis foutu.

Maintenant vous aves a peu près une idée de ce


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

que j'ai fait jusqu'ici,et d'ailleurs je ne suis pas sense raconter ma vie.

Je pense souvent que ce serait bien de se revoir pour rire un peu et avoir quelques joyeuses sorties marseillaises.Comment alles-vous et aussi comment vont les filles Elico, Irene et Catny.J'aimerai bien avoir un mot de chacune d'elles si la plume n'est pas trop lourde.Cela fait plus d'un an que je ne les af vues. Par le mome courrier j'ecris a Atenico de sorte que af Atchico entendait les filles parler de moi a la maison il n'y aura pas de gene ou de sur- prise. Je suis en train de penser que maintenant elles ont un oncie d'Amerique. Ca fait bien. Evidemment je n'ai pas encore. de ranch, d'ailleurs meme si j'en avots la possibilite cela ne me tenterait pas.

Comment va Zouquette ? Et Sopnie ? J'espere que tu la vois toujours et dans ce cas dis lui que je serais reellment content de recevoir quelques lignes d'elle si toute fole elle le veut bien. Ne pouvant lui ecrire directement tu serais bien gentille de lui retransmettre mon eventuelle reponse. C'est vrai que je suis aussi papa bresilien.

Et la belle Eliane? Bien des choses a elle.Je n'ose pas lui proposer de m'ecrire d'abord ce n'est pas poli, et ensuite on arriverait encore à se mordre, mais je crois que Jaimerais assez etre mordu per elle.Que veux-tu, j'aime souffrir moi. Bonjour a Dina, naturellement.

"Tired from a long journey" - signed the Pelican.

and now I am in Cha-Cha land. Rio is a magnificent town
principle industries are pleasure and love. If I were a
Brazilian I would say here we make love. Maybe this name
is less poetic than Rio de Janerio but it is more poetic in the sense.
Louis make much money if he were to come here in
treating veneral disease cases. I will be here for
several months and after that I think I will come and see you.

Now I am in San Paolo which is more magnifint that Rio.
In the movies you can see Bart Lancaster and Brigitte Bardot
talking in fluent Portugese.

I am now learning anew language, Portugese, which seems to
be very much like Spanish. Everything now becomes mixed
in my head. English, German, Russian, French, Georgian
Spanien. If I go to China I will be lost if I have to learn that language/

I think often of you. How are you and how are the girls.
Elico, Irene and Cathy I would like to have a letter from each
one. It has been almost a year since I have seen them. At the
same time I am writing to my brother.

How is everyone? My best regards to them.

My Dear Atchico:
26 Oct 1959.

For one hour now I have been trying to start my, letter, and don(t know how to start. My departure from GAP was inevitable, because you know what my situation was there. Had it been possible I would have written to you sooner but it was not possible.

Many things have remained as I left them and I don't want you to pay for anything which is my responsibility. I hope you will tell me who you have paid and ho how much.xxx A, soon as you answer me I will send you money. I could sendyou the money this time but I do not know if my letter will reach you and I will try to keep In touch with you again. When I left Ambert I left instructions for you but I kn don't know if they were carried out. I will write to Dassaud and I will know what has happened so far. I have been here for a few days and have been was very busy ttit since I left GAP

I cannot explain what I am doing but I ask your confidence.

How are the girls. I would like tohave some photo's of them.

I kiss ever body

Dear Jo and dear Lise,

I think it's about time I wrote you again. I wonder if, perhaps, these long months of silence haven't caused you to doubt my affection for you all, although before leaving you, you knew already that where I was going, it would be impossible for me to remain in contact with you.

How often have I seen the moment when I no longer had the chance to write you, and nevertheless, today this is possible, and I no longer know what to tell you -- My mind is a blank, but above all it's your turn to tell me what you have done. Where you are, life continues. You come and go; you see people -- and how are the three of you? What are you doing? I'm in such a hurry to hear from you that I want to mail this letter even before finishing it. There are so many things you can tell me because I need to hear you, to read you, and to be with you as before. I'm sure that some day I'll return and we'll have fun like crazy, but this is for later, perhaps in a few months from now?? I am now the most handsome man in Brazil. Evidently not for very long since I arrived only yesterday, but word has gotten around you know. They line up to see me!

In the meantime I was travelling all over, but above all I travelled quite a bit by air, and it can be said that since I left you, I spent half my time flying in the clouds with all kinds of planes, and also sometimes without planes. Sao Paulo is the pearl of Brazil. You meet a lot of Brzailian men and some pretty Brazilian women, but what I'm interested in is to know if you are all really in good health. My (greatest) wish would be to have a very long letter from each of you, including little Michel.

I give all three of you a very affectionate and big kiss.

[signed]

P.S. I want to point out to you that since the mail here leaves quite a bit to be desired and since I travel very often, it's better to write carefully the address I'm giving you. In any case I'll receive your letter.

Vous allez, vous venez, vous voyes des gens --- et puis comment allez vous tous les trois? Que faites-vous? - J'ai envie d'expedier cette lettre avant même de l'avoir terminée tellement je suis pressé d'avoir de vos nouvelles Il ya tant de choses que vous pouvez me raconter parceque j'ai besoin de vous entendre, de vous lire et d'etre avec vous comme par le passé.

REFERENCE: Office of Security Mono datod
18 September 1959

1. Further consideration has been given to the holding of subject agent in the U.S. prior to the activation of his operation in the summer of 1960. Maintaining him in a "hold" status abroad, probably In Germany, was also considered. The nature and sansitivity of the operation with which subject will be connected makes preferable a bolding status as close to Headquarters as possible. Daployment in a Headquarters elesont would provide day-to-day supervision and make possible periodic operational contacts to review questions of security, morale, and now operational developments.

2. Berefore, 33 Division solicits the support of the Office of Security in making it possible for us to hold the agent in the U.8. during the next year, making the necessary arrangements with the Attorney Goneral.

TO: Chief, SK/DIV

FROM: Director of Security

DATE: 18 September 1959

SUBJECT: AEASPIC
174303

REF: SR/DOB Memorandum dated 14 September 1959

1. The subject is an alien who, at the request of SR/DIV (for the purpose of Redsox training), was parolled into the U. S. into the custody of the CIA in April 1959.

2. According to the referenced memorandum, the subject's training for this purpose has been suspended until about 1 August 1960, when it will be reinstituted. This delay, it is understood, is due to the fact that his proposed mission has been postponed until late 1960.

3. It is observed that SR/DIV proposes that the subject be permitted to remain in the U. S., without being in custody, until his training is reinstituted in late 1960, and, in the interim, his services will be utilized by TSS. It is also noted that the subject has, in the past, been convicted of robberies abroad; has engaged in various nefarious activities and that his knowledge of the English language is limited.

4. Although recognizing that the subject is undoubtedly a likely candidate for the Redsox program, and further, that, psychologically, it might well be preferable for the individual to feel that he is not in an "arrest" category, still, this office is reluctant to place in jeopardy the arrangements made with the Attorney General by CIA, whereby individuals otherwise excludable can be brought into the U. S. for training or for other operational purposes.

5. It is felt, consequently, that further consideration should be given to the necessity for keeping AEASPIC in the U. S. during the period he is waiting for his training to be commenced.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

In the event after full.consideration, it is still deemed essential that he remain in this country during the interim period, it is suggested that the Director of Security be provided with a de- tailed memorandum of justification.

14 September 1959

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CS/S

ATTENTION : Mr. Richard Hanna

SUBJECT : Request for ZI utilization of agent, ALASTIC

1. Background:
   Subject was brought to the United States via EBRAINBO flight on 20 April 1959 for training, after which he was to have been dispatched on a black mission into the USSR as a member of a ZI team during late 1959. CI/CA Division approved (No. C-73532) on 11 March 1959. The proposed mission was recently postponed until late 1960, and it is presently contemplated that subject will re-enter training for the mission about 1 August 1960.

2. Inasmuch as considerable time, effort and expense have been devoted to the recruitment and training of the agent, who appears well qualified for the mission, it is desired to retain him during the interim in a productive capacity. Due to his rather unique background and capabilities, it is believed he could be employed in a useful capacity by TSS.

3. In view of the foregoing, it is presently planned to release subject from the present 24-hour custody, permit him to reside in an apartment in Washington, D.C. under alias, and work on a daily basis for TSS offices in an established (TSS) covert site. The work tentatively planned for him involves cataloging specific information taken from East German documents, and developing and/or improving tools and methods for picking locks. Although TSS might present other related requirements, subject's employment would not involve work which would preclude his eventual use as a REDSOX agent.

4. By separate memoranda, CI/CA Division has been requested to suspend subject's CA until he resumes training, and OS/Alien Affairs Staff has been requested to coordinate with Immigration and Naturalization Office concerning subject's proposed status and documentation.

5. Your approval of paragraph 3 above is requested.

6. For further information on this subject, please contact Mr. Perry Crookhan on extension 8331.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/CA Division

ATTENTION : Mr. Ray KeCornon

SUBJECT : Request for suspension of CI/CA No. C-73532 (AFASPIC)

1. As reported teleponically to your office, it is presently planned to utilize subject agent in the Washington, D.C. area, under alias, from the present time until early sumer, 1960. Subject will be working on a daily basis for TSS offices in an established (TSS) covert site. The work tentatively planned for him involves cataloging specific information taken from East Germen documents, and developing and/or Liproving tools and sethods for picking locks. Although T33 may present other related requirements, subject's employment will not involve work which would preclude his eventual use as a RFDSOX agent.

2. By separate remoranda, authority for utilizing subject in this ZI employment has been requested of CS/3SD, and 0S/Alien Affairs Staff has been requested to coordinate with Immigration and Naturalization Office concerning subject's proposed status and documentation.

3. It is therefore requested that subject's Operational Approval be suspended, to be reactivated upon request about 1 August 1960, at which time subject will re-enter training for the originally planned REDSOX mission.

4. For further information regarding this subject, please contact Mr. Perry Crookhan on extension 5331.

n. Map locations by:

1. Universal Military Grid

2. Latitude and Lox tudo

Note: In view that final maps for ops were not known, very little stress was placed on Grids and Lat) Long systems.

5. Compass Subjects:

1. Two Compasses were available. J. S. Army Lensatic and Swiss made reflector direct reading types.

2. Agents selected the Leonsatic as their choice.

Not to much emphasis was placed on compasses, but enough to enable the agents to use a map.

Following subjects of compasses vare taught:

a. Azimuths

b. Book azimuths

c. Converting from Map to Compass and Compass to Map

d. Map orientation by Compass

e. Compass, nite use.

6. Instructors Observations of Students

David is very intelligent and shows an interest in doing a good job on his assignment. Is cautious, out spoken, and desires to talk over any requirements given to him in writing. He diplomatically assuns leadership and discusses aspects of problems with his partner Al. He also was very interested in the subject of Map and Compasa and personally thanked me for the interests showed in their questions.

Al is also very intelligent and he, I think, respects Davida age and knowledge and eccents Davids leadership. However, if he does not fully understand Davids comments, he questions David until he is satisfied in his mind that what David is doing is right.

These agents work well together and it is my personal feeling that with proper considerations or call it "agent handling", they will accomplish their assigned mission.

I do recommend, once the type of Maps and Compasses are decided upon for ope usage, that the agents be given more work in Maps and Compass. At any rate, they do need practical work now in the use of a Map and Compass.

FROM: Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT: S.P.: 103MES 17/803 IRDS: 36915

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

1. Subject of this report is a forty year-old divorced stateless male, resident of France. Subject was born in Russia and has been residing in France since childhood. He has never received his French citizenship.

2. On 13 March 1959 Mr. George FILL, Deputy Chief BR/DOB, requested that Subject be polygraphically examined as soon as he (Subject) could be made available in a safe house in Paris, France. Mr. FILL stated that Subject was being considered for use in a sensitive position and, in view of Subject's complicated life history, it was felt necessary to check out certain portions on the polygraph. The primary interest was to polygraphically determine whether the events in Subject's life history, from approximately 1940 on, had actually occurred; whether Subject was fabricating in order to deliberately deceive the Americans because he was an opposition agent, or whether he vas exaggerating in order to make himself appear more suitable.

3. On 23, 24, and 25 March 1959 Subject vas interviewed and polygraphically examined in the French language, on the premises of a safe house in Paris, France.. Subject was very cooperative throughout the interviews and readily submitted to polygraph examination.

## DETAILS OF THE REPORT

1. Subject stated that he was born on 12 July 1918 in Gori near the town of Tiflis in Georgia. Subject has two siblings, a sister, Helen, born on 1 May 1915 and a brother, Achille, born on 17 July 1916. Subject's father was a petroleum engineer and was rather well-to-do, but following the Bolshevik Revolution and the assimilation of the short-lived Republic Into the Soviet Union, Subject and his family fled and settled in France in the early 1920's.

2. Subject's early years were spent in Paris where he attended various schools without graduating from any of then. Subject ascribes this to his inability to accept the prescribed dull instruction and the everyday boredon of learning things in which he was not interested. Subject also stated that he was rather wild and undisciplined in those days, and liked to do as ho pleased.

3. From 1935 to 1936 Subject attended the school of "Arts and Metiers" at Chalons-sur-Marne for approximately one and one-half years. He was expelled from this school because of a childish prank. Subject and several of his friends had gone into a forbidden area in the attic where they were exploring. The head of the school heard a noise and went to investigate. Subject jumped out of a window into the courtyard and was caught by the Director. This was the last of a long series of infractions of the school discipline, and the Director of the school, wanting to make an example of Subject, requested that his (Subject's) parents take Subject out of the school. This was a technical school, leading to a degree in engineering.

4. The next school that Subject attended was Ecole Breguet, which led to a degree in electrical engineering, located on Rue Pasteur in Paris. Subject lasted here for a period of six months, and was expelled because he had made a photograph of a nude woman and was caught showing it around the school.

5. From 1937 to 1938, a period of approximately 14 months, Subject attended the Ecole Cinematographique. The course here lasted for only two years, and Subject almost made it all the way. Subject stated that he was a good student in those courses in which he was interested, but he would never submit to discipline or authority from individuals for whom he had no respect and no liking. This ended Subject's formal education.

6. When Subject was in his teens he got into difficulty with the French Police on several occasions. When he was approximately 15 ½ years of age, Subject and his mother had gone to a hotel in Paris, and during a routine check of identity papers it was established that Subject's identity card had lapsed, and he was taken to the police precinct in order to explain the circumstances. Subject was accompanied by his mother, who promised to the police that this would be attended to immediately.

7. When Subject was approximately 16 years of age, he stole a dictionary from a book store. He was apprehended by the clerk who called the police, and Subject was taken to the local precinct. A call was made to Subject's mother, and Subject was released in his mother's custody. No restitution was necessary, since the book had been taken back by the clerk.

8. When Subject was 17 years of age, he and a group of his friends had gone to Robinson in order to go horseback riding. They were late in returning the horses and started galloping in the streets of Robinson in order to get back to the riding stable. The local gendarme stopped them and charged them with some infraction having to do with disturbance of the peace. Subject stated that three years later, he returned and paid a 900 franc fine.

9. When Subject was 19 years of age, he spent 12 days in jail in Paris. This was due to an infraction of the French registration ordinances for foreigners, during the days prior to the start of World War II.

The French had instituted a special means of control for the non-French citizens residing in France, and Subject had neglected to get the proper documents. Subject stated that these were the only brushes with the French Police that he had while he was a youth.

10. Regarding his Army career, Subject stated that in 1939 he volunteered for service in the French Foreign Legion. He stated that he had registered, with his class, for Amy service but had never received a notice to report, and this was the reason for his volunteering in the Legion. Subject went with his group to Tunisia, vtere re he he vas was assigned to the cavalry.

11. At this time there was an attempt made on the part of the French to form ethnic companies, and the Georgians, under the comand of Captain ODICHELIDZE (NR-IRD) (now a retired Major living in Levesinet near Paris), formed into an infantry company consisting of about 120 men and were stationed near the town of Montpelier, France. Bubject attained the rank of Corporal. This company sav no action, and in June 1941 Subject vas separated from the Legion, which vas then considered as part of the French Army.

12. Subject went through part of his demobilization procedure in Lyons, France, where he was issued 800 francs and given a travel order to proceed home to Paris. When Subject arrived in Paris, he was required to go to the gendarmerie on Boulevard Exelams, which was the demobilization center for the Paris area, where he was issued an additional 200 francs and officially taken off the rolls of the French Army. Subject stated that this vas the time of completo disorganization in France, due to the recent defeat by the Germans, and the beginning of the occupation.

13. The French Army official, with whom Subject spoke regarding the possibility of obtaining employment, advised Subject to go to the Franch Military Intelligence. Subject stated that he obtained the address, which he could not recall at this time, and attempted to get in touch with the proper individual. Subject vas unsuccessful and was given the "run around." Failing this, Subject returned home and lived at the family residence at #28 Rue Cabanis (this number has now been changed to $36). Subject attempted to lock for employment, but he was unable to find any type of work.

14. Through some friends, Subject discovered that the Germans vere hiring people for employment in Germany. Subject went to the German Arbeits Ant on the unl d' Orsay and made application for work in Germany. He stated that he was an electrician, and he was told that he would be sent to Poelitz-Stettin to work in a factory, where he would be receiving one mark per hour (which was then equivalent to 20 francs). Subject signed a contract for a period of one year, and he received a travel order to proceed to his destination.

15. Subject stated that within a few days he and a number of other volunteers were loaded aboard a special train and proceeded into Germany.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

The proposition looked good to Subject at the beginning, but soon be found that there were numerous bums and thieves who also applied as volunteers. Subject finally arrived and was assigned to work as an electrician in a factory which was engaged in the manufacture of synthetic gasoline. Subject was lodged in a camp together with a group of other voluntary workers.

16. After approximately three months Subject became restless and dissatisfied, and wanted to change employment. He applied, and got permission, for a week end pass to Stettin, which was approximately 20 to 25 kilometers from where Subject was working. In Stettin Subject met a Georgian by the nickname "Chou Chou." (Subject stated that Gulvy ZALDASTANI (NR-IRD) told him (Subject) that Chou Chou is presently in the United States). Subject stated that Chou Chou was in a German uniform with some special insignia. Chou Chou invited Subject to visit him (Chou Chou) and several other Georgians, who were being trained by the Germans for special work, apparently as saboteurs, against the Soviets. Subject went to visit Chou-Chou, met approximately 15 Georgians, and an attempt was made to interest Subject in this organization. However, nothing ever came of this.

17. Subject advised that he was getting more dissatisfied working in the factory, and a few weeks following his original visit to Stettin Subject asked for, and got, a pass to go to Berlin, in order to see an imaginary uncle. Subject received an authorization which entitled him to stay away for a period of ten days, which made it until 2 June 1942. The documents that Subject had in his possession at this time were as follows: a pink paper which identified Subject as a Georgian living in a factory lager, and which be obtained approximately ten days after his arrival at the factory, the second document was a work card which was issued to all the workers in the factory and served as an identity card. Subject's intention was to return to France, and he extended the date on the travel paper to 12 June 1942, which gave him sufficient time to accomplish his journey.

18. With this travel document Subject had no difficulty and arrived in Berlin. In Berlin Subject took the train to Aachen, where he met several other individuals who intended to cross the frontier and return to France. Subject made inquiries as to how to proceed into France, and he was told to go and see the Gestapo to obtain authorization to cross the frontier and was told to return to Berlin. Instead, Subject decided to proceed, on foot, toward the Belgian border, and this time Subject did not consult the German authorities.

19. Subject proceeded to the Eupen, Malmedy area and inquired from door to door about someone who could help him across the German frontier. Subject finally found an individual who promised, for the sum of 40 marks, to lead him (Subject) across the German-Belgian frontier, during the night. They crossed the frontier without any difficulty, and Subject proceeded on to Verviers, Belgium, where he took the train to either Liege or Charleroi. Subject made inquiries as to where he could change his German marks into

# SECRET

French francs, and the Belgians, thinking Subject to be an escaped prisoner of war, sped with instructions on how to proceed, and Subject took the train to the French-Belgian frontier, arriving in the vicinity of Valenciennes. While still on the train, Subject had to go through a control point in the forbidden zone near St. uentin. At this time he was helped by the conductor of the train and the postal clerk. Subject successfully passed through this difficult point, concealed in a mail sack. At Valenciennes a check of the passengers was made by a German control officer who somehow seemed to overlook Subject's presence, and did not ask Subject any questions. From this point on Subject had no difficulty and arrived in Paris and proceeded to his home.

20. Subject's father inquired why Subject had returned to France, and upon learning that Subject had left his job without authorization, was very upset and talked Subject into returning to Germany. After three or four days at home Subject went to the German Arbeits Ant, made an application for work as an electrician, and requested that he be assigned work in Berlin. Subject stated that he was not asked any questions, apparently no check was made, and he departed for Berlin, by train.

21. Subject was employed in a factory in Berlin which was engaged in making electrodes. Here Subject was employed as a photographer, but his job did not last very long, because Subject did not come to work on time and was not very interested in his job, since it was a very monotonous, repetitious sort of work. An incident occurred in the factory which became a pretext for Subject's transfer to another factory. There was a robbery in Subject's department, involving the theft of some platinum crucibles. While Subject was never accused of it, he was asked questions by the police officials who came to the factory to investigate the theft. The factory manager used this incident as a pretext to have Subject transferred.

22. Subject was assigned to work as an electrician in another factory in Berlin, which was engaged in the manufacture of belts for machine guns mounted in aircraft. Subject stated that the production work was very antiquated, and numerous women were engaged in inspecting belts for the proper size, by using a hand gauge. Subject built a jig which greatly speeded up the inspection work, and the management of the factory decided that Subject was a great German patriot..

23. In Berlin, Subject met a Frenchman by the name of Pascal, who was also employed as a French voluntary worker. Pascal told Subject that he (Pascal) wanted to return to France. Subject was also tired of his job, and they decided to try to get back to Paris. They went to the office of the Arbeits Amt in Berlin and got blank leave passes. Subject filled in the information on a typewriter, then with a burnt match and india ink traced the outline of the "cachet" from a validated leave pass, and returned to the Arbeits Ant office where he stood in line to have his pass validated. When Subject's turn came, the busy clerk, with a cursory

SECRET

glance at the pass, put in the official validating Arbeits Ant cachet. With tale document, Subject proceeded to the Berlin "Presidium" (Police Head- quarters) where, on the basis of this document, Surect vas able to obtain a foreigie's passport. Subject advised that he was successful in this endeavor only because the various German departments haal very little liaison with each other, and there appeared to be no central card index system whereby individuals could be cross checked. Another reason that Subject advanced as as an explanation for his success was that, according to Subject, German clerks were extremely conscious and respectful of any official looking cachet, and could not conceive that anyone would have the effrontery of counterfeiting an official document. Subject explained that the infor mation he had filled in the passport stated that he was allowed to proceed to France in order to visit his parents. Subject described the foreimer's passport as a regular booklet with a grayish color. The sexe procedure vas utilized in order to obtain a passport for Pascal.

24. Sometine during the spring of 1943, Subject and Pascal returned to Paris, and both decided that there was no point in remaining in France under the German occupation, and they made plans too to Brazil. They took the trala and proceeded to the Spanish border, arriving in the town of Hendaye. They crossed into Spain through a mountain trail, and attempted to exchange their French francs into Spanish pesetas. They were unsuccessful, vere looked upon very suspiciously, remained for one day and decided to return to France, where the German Grenz Policei, which Subject believes vere ne bars of the Wehrmacht, arrested Subject and Pascal and kent then under guard for a period of approximately four days. During this time, they were mildly interrogated, and a check was made to see whether they were wanted by the German Police. After four days, they were released and taken under guard to the Hendaye Railroad Station, and were told to buy tickets to Paris, which they had indicated as their residence.

25. As soon as the German authorities left, Subject and Pascal ex- changed their tickets for another destination, and got out at the town of Pau. There they proceeded, on foot, to Holeon on the border of Vichy France. They crossed over and met two gendarme and told the gendarme that they (Subject and Pascal) wanted to join the Foreign Legion. At the gendarmerie, they were given an official travel order to proceed to Toulouse. Upon arriving there they were told to proceed to harseilles. In Marseilles, Subject and Pascal made a faux pas. Tay ahowed their German passports, and the attitude of the French changed. Pascal indicated to the French authorities that he would volunteer as a vorker in Africa, and Subject stated that he would return to Paris. Subject went to Lyons where he had a friend, a far removed cousin by the name of Guiga vao vas later killed during an air raid. Subject's cousin attempted to help hin (Subject) but was unable to do so, and Sbject took the train to the Chalons-sur-Soane, the border between occupied and unoccupied France.

25. At the border, the guard misread Subject's name at Fritz WILI. Subject played his role to the hilt, using his knowledge of the German

6


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

SE

Language, and said that he was a representative of the Aristice Commission.
Subject crossed the border, however, on the occupied side Subject was stopped by the German border guard. Bubject showed the guard is (Subject's) pass- port and was told that it was not sufficient, that he needed a travel order. Subject decided to bluff and asked to be taken to the bestquarters of the border guards, where te nanged to convince the official that he (Subject) vas really ng back to Berlin in order to resne his wors. Subject told this official that he (Subject) had been to visit his brother in Marseilles, and that the French were not cooperative and had refusei to 1880 ه حل pass to return to Berlin. The official of the border card which may have possibly, according to Subject, have been the Gestapo, vrete Subject out a pass indicating that Subject was returning to his work in Brila.

27. This enabled Subject to proceed through the control point, but Instead of returning to Berlin Sobject proceeded back to Paris. Here Sub- Ject remained for several months without doing any kind of vark. During this time, while in a bar, Subject was talking to the barmaid, who tol Subject about her brother who was a vas a prisoner of var in Germany. Subject told her that it wasn't very difficult to get out, and said that he would try and see whether he could do it himself. Subject asked her for a photograph of her brother, and he had the intention of using it on a passport. How over, all this came to nothing because Subject was not properly equipped at this time.

28. It was at this time, in late 1943, that Subject saw how easy it vas to go back and forth between Germany and occupied France. Since ba had a passport Subject was not stopped between the two countries, and in order to insure free travel he made himself a permanent travel order. This he obtained through Georgian friends, who were working in various German ministries. Subject's knowledge of photography was very helpful.

29. 8ubject's friends, noticing that he seemed to go back and forth at will, began to charge hin with small coomissions. He would take coffee and various other foodstuffs, which were scarce in Germany but easily ob- tained from Spain, through devious channels. Subject would either deliver or sell the products to certain individuals in Germany, and would keep a certain percentage of the money for himself. Subject quickly became avare that he could make more money if he could obtain the itens imself. Sub- ject made contacts with various individuals who were engaged in making trips back and forth from Paris to the Spanish border. Exy would bring lack coffee, tea, American dollars, and various other acarce itens. Some German soldiers vero unvitting members of Subject's blackmarket operations.

30. In order to do this work successfully, Subject had to become ac- quainted with the various passos and travel orders issued by various German departments. Subject set up a laboratory, complete with potoraphic en- Larging apparatus. He photograplied and enlarged visas in order to be able to reproduce the exact outlines and lettering in the visa. Then he would reduce then to the proper size and transfer them on to the proper documents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

# SECRET

Subject got in touch with an engraver in Paris, who engraved the proper plates from which Subject could reproduce, at vill, the proper stamp for the proper document. The paper itself was not a critical in, since the various German ministries voully used any available paper. Occasionally there was a satemars, and in that cace, Subject reproduced the watermarks by first photographing the document, washing the watermark, which usually consisted of vavy lines, from the negative, then Subject would make another negative and wish off everything but thở vàturark. Subject vent so far as to actually engage in substituting photographs on passports.

31. Subject stated that he would buy passports, which were passports of foreigners working in Germany, and substitute pages where necessary, and the photographs were handled in the following manner. Subject stated that the photographs in these passports were attached by means of netal clasps to the passport page and, therefore, could not be very well recovel. Subject would, 1 stead, remove the gelatia from the photograpa very care fully by using a very mild dilutel acid, such as acetic acid, first putting a little wax on to the clasps so that they would not be eroded by the acid and placing blotter paper under the photograph. Diis acid solution vould dissolve the gelatin emulsion, anil Subject would remove it from the photo- graphic paper. Next, ho would take the photograph of the new owner of the passport al, by using steam or warm water, he would soften the emulsion and then carefully lifting it off the paper, using tweezers and little sticks of wood, Subject would transpose the emulsion inco the photographic paper of the passport. Subject stated that this was an extremely delicate operation, and required long and careful practice on his part.

32. During the above procedure the photograph was slightly distorted, and occasiomlly the emulsion would absorb too much water and would over- flow the bounds of the original photograph. In that case, Subject vould trin the edges to fit properly. Subject stated that one corner of the photograph would usually be stamped by the validating office, and if the catchet was in ink, the ini: would ramin on the paper when Subject lifted off the old caulsion. This ink would show through the new emulsion, and on cursory examination it would be impossible to distinguish whether the lak vas over the cmulsion or wider the emulsion. If the catchet were of the impression type, there would be no problem whatsoever since it would show through the nev emulsion very readily.

33. Subject stated that he obtained for himself a Romanian diplomatic passport which he bout, through a girl friend, fron a Rumanian at the Rumanian Embassy in Berlin. Sbject bought this passport for 1000 maris, and he used it only while he was traveling in Berlin. In effect, Subject assumed an entirely new identity whenever he stepped into his car since the registration and driver's license vere all nade out to conform with the rame on the passport. Since 3 bject's car was registered in the name of an employee of a foreign embassy, Subject was entitled, as a diplomat, to a larger cas ration.

34. Subject continued his blackmarket activities until approximately February 1944 when, through an oversight, Subject was arrested by the German Police. Prior to his arrest, Subject lived extremely well and occupied a good apartment in Berlin. Subject's family thought that he occupied a high place in the Ministry, because Subject was in possession of large sums of money, and also appeared to have no difficulty traveling anywhere. Subject stated that he even obtained a pass for his father, who wanted to visit Munich. Subject stated that his father, at the time, devised a system for extracting oil from shale, and Subject, wanting to help his father with his (father's) knowledge, used a stratagem whereby he (subject) gave 100,000 marks to his mother to invest into his father's firm.

35. Subject stated that he helped ten French workers and four prisoners of war to return to France. This came about as a result of requests that came to Subject from friends and not as an organized plan to help any individuals escape from Germany. The only individual, who was a prisoner of war whose name Subject could remember, was a Frenchman by the name of C. VILLEMAIN (NR-IRD). VILLEMAIN, even though a prisoner of war, worked on a farm during the week and could go into town on Sundays. The others whom Subject helped were deported workers. Subject recalled the names of two of these, Henri JOINEY (NR-IRD) and Charles ALLAINES (NR-IRD). Subject stated that he provided each of these men with a passport, a travel order, ration cards, and a small sum of money. Subject also instructed each one on how best to conduct himself in order to avoid being apprehended at the border.

36. Subject also furnished an individual by the name of EDELSTEIN with a travel order. EDELSTEIN was a German Jew, who was engaged in black-marketing operations. EDELSTEIN had managed to conceal his Jewish background and was in possession of a German passport, but feeling that the Germans were about to arrest him, he prevailed upon Subject to furnish him with a false travel order, which Subject did.

37. Subject advised that he was successful in this work because each German ministry issued its own travel orders, and there was no means of double checking; first, the difficulty was too great to double check the temporary duty travel orders; secondly, the Germans were extremely respectful of official looking documents; thirdly, because of the low mentality of personnel at check points; finally, because the passports were not counterfeit in all cases, and all Subject did was to substitute a new photograph for the original. In return for the favor that Subject extended to these people, some of them reciprocated by helping him with his blackmarket operations.

38. Subject had a plan whereby he wanted to enlarge his blackmarket operations, and had the intention of setting up a two-way radio system to improve his communications. VILLEMAIN, the French prisoner of war whom Subject helped, was an engineer, and Subject had intended to use VILLEMAIN in setting up the post in Paris. However, before Subject could accomplish this he (subject) was arrested by the German Police.

39. Another person whom Subject met in Berlin was named LUCAS, a French- man who was employed in a radio shop in Berlin. LUCAS became an associate of Subject and helped Subject by stealing various spare parts, for the purpose of setting up the radio station. LUCAS was also instrumental in bringing about Subject's downfall. LUCAS had met a young lady in Berlin. She was a Belgian national and said that she had a fiance in Paris whom she had not seen for some time. She asked for help in going to Paris, and Subject was to meet her in the Cafe Truf in Berlin. Subject eventually met her and told her that he (Subject) would make her some false documents, to enable her to get to Paris. A meeting was arranged for the next day, at which time she was to bring a passport and a photograph and transmit to Sub- ject. She did not show up at the appointed hour and place. Subject waited for a short time and then went to the railroad station, accompanied by his girlfriend, Astree SCHMIDT (NR-IRD), and his partner in blackmarket activ- ities, KATZ. The platform was empty, except for the girl Subject was to meet. Subject addressed her and asked her why she had not kept the appoint ment, and she replied, "You are going to be arrested." At this moment the German Police converged on the platform where Subject, SCHMIDT, and KATZ were standing, and arrested then.

40. Subject stated that on this day he was leaving on a trip to Paris and had brought along four suitcases containing radio parts, pistols, am- munition, inks, printing equipment, cameras, and various paraphernalia necessary for the manufacture of false documents. The police took Subject back to his hotel and searched the apartment, where they found more equip- ment and photographed everything. After that, Subject was taken to the police station, where he was separated from his friends. The arrest oc- curred on either 21 or 22 February 194 at approximately 1127. Subject recalls the time, because the only day train to Paris left at about that hour.

41. Subject stated that the previous evening he had suffered an ac- cident on his hand. He had found a small phosphorous bomb and was un- screwing the detonator, when it blew up and cut off several of Subject's fingers. At the police station, Subject was treated, medically. Subject was interrogated for a period of approximately eight months. In the beginning, he was interrogated every day, and he admitted to the following crimes: Subject stated that he did engage in making false documents and that he was endangering the security of the German Reich, and was charged by the police with espionage and of conducting intelligence with the enemy. Subject did not specifically admit to these two charges, but kept up the police interest in his case by evasive answers. Subject was condemned to death, but before the sentence could be carried out Subject was liberated by the entry of the American Army, on 12 April 1945.

42. Subject had been an inmate of the German prisons in Tegel, Plotzen See, Hanover, and Wolfenbutten. Subject stated that he believes the plans for his execution were delayed because of a scheme that he devised to in- terest the authorities in him. Subject stated that he advised the Germans that he was the inventor of a motor which could be run on hydrogen.

10


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

Subject stated that he told the Chief warden in the prison of his (Subject's) invention, and the Warden told Subject to write a letter to a special German service which was in charge of this type of information. Subject believes that it was known as Srvice Dienstelle 000). A representative arrived and interviewed Subject asking Subject to furnish plans for this motor. Subject stated that he had hidden part of the plans, and the investigation went on. Subject always managed to put them off slightly.

43. Subject stated that he made two attempts to escape while in the custody of the German Police. The first time, Subject was under police interrogation in Berlin and during an air raid the prison in which Subject was being held was destroyed, and Subject attempted to escape but was caught. The second time, Subject was at the prison at Plotzen See and made a key out of a piece of wire and opened the door of his cell. However, he was unsuccessful in this escape attempt also.

44. Subject stated that his two friends, Othar and Guivy ZALDASTAHI (NA-IRD), who are now in the United States, know about Subject's black-market activities and the circumstances leading to his arrest, and also know about his subsequent prison term. Guivy even participated in some of Subject's blackmarket deals, and Othar came to see Subject while he was in the Plotzen See Prison.

45. The reason for Subject's transfer from prison to prison was due to the rapid Soviet advance, and luckily Subject found himself in an area which was overrun by the American Army, in the middle of April 1945. After liberation, Subject and the other prisoners were sent to a camp in the vicinity of Kassel, from which they were to be repatriated to France. However, living conditions were extremely difficult, and Subject and several friends decided to go out on their own. They occupied a deserted villa on the outskirts of Kassel. Subject brought in electric service by utilizing American Army cables and attaching them to the electric wires. One day an American Army truck passed over the wires and tore them. The driver stopped and apologized, and said that he would come back later and fix the wires. In the afternoon, the driver of the truck returned with several companions and they connected the electric wires to the house. The driver then asked Subject whether he (driver) could bring his girlfriend to the house, and Subject agreed. This went on for several days, and finally the driver's girlfriend remained to live at the house. The driver then brought some of his companions, who brought their girlfriends to live at the house. Subject and his friends were supplied with American Army rations, and this convenient arrangement continued for several months until Subject and his friends decided to return to France.

46. Subject made his way to the repatriation center in Paris, which was located in the Hotel Lutetia on the Boulevard Raspail. At this time Subject claimed to have lost all of his documents and went under the name of David DATO. He claimed to be a French citizen who had been a prisoner of war in Germany. However, Subject was unable to carry this off, as he was recognized by one of the Georgians, who worked in the repatriation

center. Subject was interrogated by the French Security Officer, who established Subject's true identity. Subject then stated, to the Security Officer, that he (Subject) had been deported to Germany as a forced laborer. The Security Officer believed Subject, and Subject received the 33,000 franc award which was mandatory for all repatriated forced laborers. Thus was in early 1946. Subject quickly spent this money, and on the advice of the examining Security Officer, Subject got in touch with the "Service de Renseigne-ments France" on Boulevard Maunory in Paris. Subject tried to contact a Colonel PASSY, who had been known during the War under the Non de Guerre, Lieutenant Colonel FRANKLIN. Subject did not get to see PASSY but was told to leave his name with the secretary. Finally, Subject was contacted and asked to report on the Georgians in France. Subject refused this assignment, and this was his only contact with an intelligence service.

47. Subject stated that he originally met Jean ADAM when they were both children and again after the War. Subject was working for an architect who had a decorating firm, and after his friendship with ADAM was resumed, ADAM convinced Subject that it was easy to take money by committing robberies. Subject at first refused to participate, but then agreed because of his friendship for ADAM and because of the excitement. The first robbery was committed in early 1949. Subject used a broken revolver, into which he inserted wooden bullets which he had whittled. This robbery was so successful and so interesting that the two partners decided to commit another robbery of the same type. This was also successful, and they attempted a third one. The targets for all of these robberies were jewelry shops. The third robbery was unsuccessful, and Subject wanted to go back to an honest life. Subject was, at this time, happily married, and was afraid that his wife might find out about his activities. However, ADAM threatened that if Subject did not work with him on another robbery, he (ADAM) would tell Subject's wife about the prior robberies. Subject agreed to participate in one more escapade, and in June 1950 they committed a successful robbery on the Bank "Credit de l' Ouest" on the Boulevard Hausmann in Paris. The proceeds of the robbery were split by the two, and very shortly thereafter ADAM was apprehended by the French Police because of his wild spending. Under interrogation, ADAM admitted to the robberies and implicated Subject. Subject was apprehended by the French Police, while he was on the French-Spanish border. He was brought back to Paris for trial, and was sentenced, on 5 January 1953, to seven years at hard labor. He was released on 19 December 1955 for good behavior. This is on record with the French Police and was not discussed at length with Subject.

48. Subject stated that he has not heard from his father and sister since their return to the Soviet Union, except for the following: Approximately two years ago, Subject's brother received a letter addressed to "The sons of Count bearing the address of Subject's brother in Gap, France. This letter was ostensibly from a woman whom neither Subject nor his brother knows and asked for news of them. It had a reply envelope in it, and Subject does not know whether his brother ever

ansvered the letter. prior to this, in aprroximately 1949, Subject received
a letter from his father which was about 12 pages long, and which asked Sub-
ject to send his father technical looks on refrigeration. Subject stated
that he never replied to this letter. Subject had news of his sister, who
used to write occasionally to her friend, Madame Anette BARET (NR-IRD), who
lived at #52 Boulevard St. Germain, Paris, France.

49. Subject also received news of his sister from a 2nd or 3rd cousin
    by the name of Mathieu KERRESSELIDZE (NR-IRD), who is about 52 years of age
    and lives at #17 or #27 Avenue General DeGaulle, Leves ist (Seine et Oise),
    France. Subject stated that Mathieu was a prisoner of war in Siberia and
    had probably been a member of the Bergan Battalion who had parachuted
    into the USSR during the early laws of the War. Mathieu returned to Paris
    approximately one and one-half years ago. His name had been in a Georgian
    newspaper. Mathieu vas arrested by the French and charged with collaborating
    with the Germans. He was interved by the French for a short time and
    acquitted. At the present time Mathieu is in Germany attempting to find
    work. His last known address is the one stated above. Subject was not
    certain of the dates that Nathieu returned to France. Subject sav Mathieu
    in Paric, and during a conversation Mathieu stated that he had met Subject's
    sister in Moscow, after his release from the Siberian prisoner of war carip.
    At that time Mathieu vas in Moscow in contact with the French Consulate,
    which issued him a paper stating that he was a French citizen. Mathieu then
    got in touch with Subject's brother, who sent Mathieu sufficient funds to
    return to France.

50. Subject stated that he has two distant cousins in the United States,
    Guivy and Othar ZALDASTANI. Subject stated that he recently sav other, who
    had come to France on a visit, and Subject asked other to tell Guivy that
    everything is going well. Subject's maternal uncle, Djibo (Gabriel)
    KANTCHELI (NR-IRD), who is a taxi driver and lives at #37 Rue de la
    Rochefoucauld, Paris IX, France, is well acquainted with the majority of
    the Georgians who formerly resided in France but are now spread throughout
    the world. Subject's father vas a member of the Georgian nobility and, a8
    such, had a large circle of friends.

51. Subject stated that he would be very interested in obtaining a
    permanent job with the Americans, which would give him a sense of accomplish-
    went and vould satisfy his yearning for an exciting and unusual life.

# Office Memorandum * UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: William Roger, SR/BOB

DATE: 27 May, 1957

FROM: William R. Caraway, O/Tr/CD/MS

SUBJECT: Personal observation of Dave and Albert

My personal opinion of the two students that received instruction in First Aid from me, The period of acquaintance was four and one half days. They were very receptive to the course and were able to ask intelligent questions on the material being presented. When being questioned, both could give a good dissertation in their answering even though there was some language problem. How to the individuals.

Dave: In my conversations with Dave, he would bring up the subject of hiking and camping, saying that he couldn't see the necessity in this and that he would rather live in a house with all of the conveniences at hand. The idea of physical labor doesn't appeal to him, he would rather use his brain. When there was a lull in conversation, he would be the one to start it. He enjoys motoring, and the feeling of being free from those around him. Although Dave stated that he would like to live alone and do his own cooking, housekeeping and etc.; I got the feeling that most of it is just talk and that he would rather have a companion, someone that would sort of more or less take care of him.

At the dining table, he would eat only those foods he recognized and those that he enjoyed. He would ask about the others, but would seldom try those.

Albert: Quiet, very seldom talked about himself. At meal times he ate everything that was placed before him. Liked to insert a little humor into life. Seems to enjoy physical exercise as well as mental. 461-233477


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 120

in summaries I would like to say that they were consistent.

, both displayed a keen interest in anything for somewhat that was interested to them. I would say that the race officer used good judgement in their selection, the making a team of traps two was in good taste, at one seems to make up where the other lacks.

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Observations during Period 20 April - 2 May of D. Tarient.

## 1. Physical Description:

Height: 5' 6"
Weight: 120 lbs.
Hair: Black - balk headed
Eyes: Dark Brown
Distinguishing marks: Missing first joints of right thumb and right first finger. Wears moustache (black)

## 2. Physical Conditions

Subject seems to enjoy walking and running. He remarked that he could trot along three miles in one hour.

## 3. Eating Habits:

Subject is not too impressed with American way of eating, that is, having all the food put on the table and then each taking a portion of each course and filling up the plate.

Subject feels that more time should be devoted to eating than Joe C. alloted for eating. He was amazed that it only took the latter about 15 minutes to eat. Likewise, Subject likes to eat one course at a time and that each course be brought into the room and placed on the table separately. After the meal he would like fresh fruit, cheese, coffee. He does not care much for sweets, neither does he care for cottage cheese salad, l.e., cottage cheese and canned fruit. This combination irks him. Subject was assured that this was a manner of eating in America and that it was a custom and that the undersigned probably would find some faults with the way the French serve food. Dave enjoys fruit juices.

Dave eats his food in the manner to which he is accustomed. He puts only one course on his plate and only when finished eating it does he help himself to the next course, etc.

At breakfast he is a very light eater. He is content just with coffee, toast and juice.

## 4. Freetime:

During the undersigned's stay with Subject, most of the freetime was spent watching TV, walking and attending English lessons. Subject stated that he wanted to learn English, so the undersigned accommodated him. A 35 cent Cardinal edition of "English thru Pictures" was purchased for him and was used as the text book. Subject was coming along fairly well in the language. Subject is able to manage satisfactorily in the language only


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

thing which hinders his is his lack of confidence. Time will probably
take care of his improvement.

5. General Remarks:

He was amazed that he was in the U.S.A., though he was here he stated that he could not believe that he was here. The relative seclusion during the past two weeks did not reassure him in anyway that he definitely was in the U.S.A. Many of his ideas regarding American seemed to be impressions that he obtained from seeing American films while in France. Thus he has a little difficulty trying to place the America that he has observed now with what preconceived ideas that he already has of America.

While in town on 23 April, his only remark about Washington was that he did not see any exceptionally beautifully girls (Hollywood types). Ee also stated that the American males, i.e. American Soldier in 1945, was nice strong, healthy type of male.

Enroute from the airport Dave wore his blackout glasses until we reached the district line. While crossing the South Capital Street Bridge Dave sensed that we were brossing the bridge because of the vibrations caused by the car passing over the steel mesh on the bridge, stated that we must be crossing the Fotomac river now. Another question was how far was the airport from the house where we were headed. The undersigned agreed that we were crossing the Fotomac and a that the area we were going to was over fifty miles from the district.

By nature Dave is very curious. To satisfy his curiousity he uses various ruses in order to elicit information regarding his status and future.

Whenever the undersigned went for a walk with Dave, usually before end after meals, the former expected to be asked numerous personal questions. One or twice, Dave mentioned that he did not know why he was here, what kind of job he would have, etc.

Dave was assured that this sounded somewhat irregular, the undersigned felt that he mist have been told something womewhere along the line. At this point, Dave would stop asking questions. Later on the undersigned learned that Dave was very talkative with Tom Miller (alias) and told the latter the whole story about what was told to date. It is assumed that Dave was trying to show Tom that he knew everything and thus hope that Tomé would fill any little details that Dave would omit. These were two different approaches that Dave used trying to elicit information from the undersigned and Tom Miller.

Dave seems to be quite a perfectionist when it come to things mechanical. While at the Log Cabin, Dave tried on af number of occasions to adjust the TV set. Dave could not understand why the TV set sometimes would not function properly particularly whenever a passing plane would go over it would interfere with the sets operation. This account did not suit hire for he had to try and adjust, so as a result more time was expended on adjusting than watching TV. lie was quite irked because he felt that the TV was malfunctioning.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 125

Dave likes to watch cowboy and gangster films, and the children liked it too because the participants spoke very slowly and he could understand the language.

Periodically, Dave would cuestion the undersigned on schedule for the day and when told what it would be it seemed that he would fail to hear what was told to him and later on would propose the same question. Dave did not like the idea that he had to start English from basic he wanted to have something more advance.

Dave like to test others and it seems that he will continually do so throughout the course.

Dave did not seen to impressed with the idea that he had to be debriefed all over again. His comment was that he told this over and over so many times and that it was not necessary to do over again. At times when he did not want to answer a question he would state that he already told this to George and drop the matter there.

1 May 1959:

Shortly before Dave's departure for another safehouse, Dave remarked that he was not much concerned about the training that he will have to undergo during the next phase but is concerned more about "der Tat." what he was driving at was to try to elicit what information he could regarding the work that he will be required or expected to fulfill once training is over, i.e., the mission. Dave was assured that this naturally would follow only after the completion of the training, then he would be informed by the people concerned that at this time such information could not be given him.

That evening, the undersigned stayed with Dave and Albert at the new safehouse. At supper remarked about the manner in which the food was served that it was not according to French custom. Albert said you eat the way you want, yet at the same time filling up his plate.

After suprer, Dave querying Albert about the property, to whom does the land belong etc. All Albert could say that it all belongs to the man who owns the house and left matters drop at that.

Dave was quite witty at the supper meal today. This was the first time that the undersigned seemed to see him in such jovial spirits. Both men seemed to hit it off very well. Dave seems to recognize Alberts brawn.

Dave seemed to like the cooking better at the new location. He stated that this place wasmuch better that the other place. He stressed that the housekeepers here were much better that the others.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

5. Miscellaneous:

Subject failed to give any information about a sousin of his who is residing in the U.S.A. Subject told the debriefer that this information was already passed to George.

Cousin: could be a Wachtan Tschishchivili, who resides at the Oakland Apartments, Columbia Pike, Arlington, Va. Wachtan works for VOA, GS-ll, radio announcer on the Georgian program. He is a member of some oriental research group which meets at Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, D.C.

   Date of birth: possibly 2nd February, year unknown.
   Profession: mining engineer, special petrol refinery.
   Studied in Russia, and one year in Freiburg, Germany.

Historical background: Tzitzichvili was the second-largest family in Georgia. One area in Georgia is called after this family. Simon has the title of "Count". He is one of the two pretenders to the Throne of Georgia, the name of the second pretender being BAGRACION.

In 1921 Simon, together with his wife and three children, fled from Georgia via Turkey to France. The family remained for two weeks in Marseilles, and moved then to Paris. They were wealthy then. Simon took a hosiery shop. Later things went worse, and Simon for a while was a taxi driver. Still later he tried with some inventions, but had no material success. In 1942 he went to Berlin, in connection with one of his inventions. Later his wife followed him. David went to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 138

Germany before the father went. David's sister went to Berlin probably in 1941/1942 (no clear statement about this). In 1944 Simon, his wife and their daughter moved from erlin to Vienna, Austria. In 1946 they came back to Paris, together with their son-in-law. In 1948, after the mother had died, Simon, together with the daughter and the son-in-law returned to USSR.
From USSR Simon has writtenmone letter in which he had asked for literature concerning "the cold" what made David to think that he is dealing with the problems of refrigeration. According to the informations received from Mathe KERESSELIDZE Simon lived in 1958 in TIFLIS.

4. Kother: Marie, née KANTCHELI, of Gergian origine. The date of birth, 2 February, might have been hers or father's year of birth-unknown.
   She poisoned herself in Paris, in 1958, in connection with Simon's talks of going back to USSR: she did not like to go, especially because the sons refused to go.

5. Sister: Helen, nickname: Elico, the oldest in the family. Born: 1 May 1915, in GROZNY.
   During WW II she went from Paris to Berlin, where she worked for six month in the East-Ministry (Cst-Ministerium).
   In 1942, probably in May, she married in Berlin a Georgian, Irakli LORDKIPANIDZE, who at that time worked with the German Security Service - "Sicherheits Dienst" (SD).
   In 1944 she, together with her parents, moved to Vienna, Austria, where the husband joined them later.
   They had two children, both sons: Kodar, born in 1945 in Vienna and Dimitry, born at the end of 1947, in Vienna.(?)
   Nodar's nickname is TSITSOU.
   In 1946 (?) the family returned from Vienna to Paris (together with Helen's parents):
   In 1943-49 they returned, together with Simon, back to the USSR (Note: presumed together with their children, although David did not mention the children).
   According to the information received from Xxx Hathé KERESSELIDZE, in 1958 he has seen Helen in Moscow and she had told him that she is working in Tirlis in quality of a teacher of languages. She had been detained for five years (1952-1957) in a camp or closed town because she had said something on the address of Stalin, in fact nothing bad, but this was misunderstood and falsely reported to the authorities. She was vindicated after Salin's death, and she even was paid the salary retroactively for the time she had been detained.

6. Brother: Achilles, nickname: ATCHICO..
   Born: 17 July 1916, in BORZHOMI, Georgia.
   Occupation: Architect, selfemployed, associated with two other architects: Georges LONGUIR and fnu ROQUES, all three having their office in GAP, Deptm Hautes Alpes, France, corner of Rue Pasteur and Rue de France. In the firm Achilles uses

a new last name: DE PANASKHET, which he has taken sometimes in 1946 or 47. Panaskhet is the name of the village in Georgia where the family had its origine.
The official full version of Achilles name is now: TZITZICHVILI dit De PANASKHET. For his children the full name is but: De PANASKHET.
During WWII Achilles was an officer in the French Army, in africa and in Germany.
In 1944 Achilles married Nathela JORDANIA, a daughter of the former President of the Republic of Georgia (1917-1921). They are divorced now. Of their three daughters two, both born in Paris, are living with the father: Maria-Helene (14) and Irene (12. Catherine (6),born in Gap, is living with the mother, who, since 1959, is remarried. Her second husband is a physician, Dr.Louis ELEET. The last name of this physician was formerly BORREAU. He changed it because of the bad meaning: bourreau = the hangman.

7. Cousin Mathe KERESSELIDZE, who had joined the Germans during WW II and was parachuted to USSR. He was captured there, sentenced to 15 years of hard labor (1943-58) and was then allowed to repatriate to France, where he arrived some six months to one year ago. Now he is in Stuttgart, Germany.
   Before returning to France he has occasionally met in Moscow Helene who had told him of herself and of her father (see items 3 & 5). (NOTE: Asked by the debriefer, whether Helene had said to Mathe something about her husband, David mentioned having heard nothing about Irakli. He explained this by the bad relations between Helene and Irakli: the initial big love had faded soon. No questions were asked about the children of the couple.)

# 3. David's childhood:

1.  David does not remember about the kindergartens he had been in. He has visited 15 differnt schools.

2.  The first school, he remembers, was NOTRE DAME, a Catholic boarding school in Boulogne sur Seine, where he remained for two years (4 to 6 years of age). His brother went to the same school. The oldest of the students were up to 18 years, making their bacalaureate.

David remembers the names of: Pere REGINBAULT, the assistant director; two teachers, sisters ademoiselles CASTAGNIET; Frehel PRIME - one of the neighbors in the dormitory;
De BASSONPIERRE, a pupil of a higher class, was shot during the war as a "collaborateur"; an other pupil: Le CUDONEC. The pupils wore navy-type uniforms with a cot of arms on the sleeve showing the letters "ND" (Notre Dame).

Of the events he remembers that he could not climb a pole because his arms were too short, he could not hold himself tight. Once he saw a blood-stained chair in the school's dining-room: the director had shot at and wounded during the night a thief. Once his hair got twisted or pinched between the bars of the bed; he thought that somebody was under the bet and was pulling him on hair.

The family lived at that time at Rue Poussin, later at Quai de Tokio, which is now called Quai des Etats Unies. He and his brother were taken to the school normally by taxi on Sunday night, and brought home on Saturday after the lessons.

3.  In connection with the change of the living place he changed to Lycée Montaigne, Rue Guynemer, when he was 7. He attended the 8th grade, the grades being: 12-the lowest, 1 the highest.

There he remembers a teacher Mr. DIREMER (pronounced -dirr), who had yellow spots on his hands. He is dead now. He had a son. He also remembers a girl in this school, Genevieve DRUMOND, who was sitting immediately before him. He liked the girl very much, but did not dare to show his liking, sauf by pulling her on hair. They went together to this school up to the 7th grade.

4.  The next school was "L'Ecole Communale". Rue Littrée, corner Rue Vaugirard. David's brother went to the same school. David remembers a teacher Mr.SATARELLI whose nickname was TETINARD. A pupil SANTEX was good in gym. The father of a Jew had a curiosity shop, the boy's name was Joachim.

At this time David's father had already given up his hosiery shop and was working as a taxi driver of a company-owned car.

5.  When David was 8 or 9 years of age, the family moved from Paris to VIROFLAY, some 3 km from Versailles. The move was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

made by taxi: father had to make many rounds. They got an one-family house with a garden of about 1000 square meters. David and his brother went to the"Lycee iloche"

6. In Viroflex David lerned to know a boy Jean ADAM, 6 months older than he himself. Jean was the single son of the director of the perfume export house. David had a fight in woods with Jean after he had got a stone drown by Jean on his head. They were good friends later.

Jean had friends: two brothers AR FIELD, one's first name was Jack, and their nice looking but loose minded sister Haud. When competing in springing from a swing, Jack broke one of his legs. David and Jean peated him on a chair, carried to the porch of his house and run away.

David and Jean grounded a "secret club". They built an Escimo igloo and made fire in it. The igloo took fire and ignited the surrounding fiend and forrest. The boys fled. The fire-brigade had to battre the fire. David went home. He did not say anything to his father about his part in the brand: he explained his red face my much running when playing Later the police came . David's fault was detected, his father had to pay the damages, he had not enough money for this.

7. David's father had, by this time, given up taxi driver's job. He was working on different inventions. He was sure he had discovered petrol fields in France, but he was not believed. He inventend a device for authomatic replay of records; he asked for 90% of the intake but was offered 40 only. Father had a movie projector with which David was not alloved to play. Thus, David consrued his own projector and showed it to the father. Father was thrilled, and allowed David to use his (father's ) projector. David did, and broke it.

7a In this school David made munk nonsencex. He thinks that the reason for this was the need to show up he was small and his name made the French children laugin and mock him. iie wanted to show that he was a full guy. He got his third reprimand when he burned carbide in an incstand. He was thrown out when he planted a cracker in a restroom in the garden of the school and a teacher fell into the bassin of the restroom when the cracker exploded. An other pupil, Ramon GOELITZ had seen him planting the cracker and had reported this.

8. In Viroflex, neighboring to the house where David lived, resided ten single Georgians who had made some resistance to the Russians during We I or after this. David used to visit those men, he was something like a mascot of theirs. They had a dog and an ape. They taught David some small trick: Six of the men were working as taxi drivers for the subsistence of all the group. One stood at home, cooking for all, and one, Kakhutza TCHCLOKASHVILI, was the boss. David remembers some names or nicknames of them: CHCCHOU, SACHIKO, GARGARETHELI, SERGO (died), COLA.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

9. After having been thrown out from the Lycée Hoche, Dawid was sent to a communale school in viroflex, some three kilometers away from their home. He was given morey for the street car, however, he did not take the car: he used the money to buy what he needed for his silly things and acts.

10. At the end of the term David was taken back to the Lycée:his mother, probably, had asked for this, and had given some maney, -one can do everything with money. e remained in this school until they moved back to Paris, to Vanves.

11. David's contact with Jean Adam continued up to the beginning of the war. David has never abtruded himself to him. He followed many plans of Jean, although he was sure that he could have made better plans. The parents of David and Jean had nothing in common, although they knew one-another. However, it happened that Jean an always lived somewhere in the vicinity of David, and when Tzitzichvili-s moved to Paris Vanves, Jean lived near the Porte Françon.

12. In Vanves David was sent to Lycée Michelet. After six months he was thrown out. They were served some vegetables in this college at lunch times. Once a plate with vegetables was caught by a pupil when this was upon to fall down, and the catcher was glad. David, however, took the plate and deliberately threw it to the floor, brook it. The supervisor came and asked how did this happen. David told the truth, and was throwh out of the school.

13. Then David, 13 or 14, was sent to a community school. There he had to take a test to get the "Certificat d'Etudes" He took the first, written part of the test, and after it, during the lunch time he got so fascinated by a bricklayer's work that he started to help the man, also because he as promised 10 Francs for this. When he later inquired about the time, he learned that he was already late for the oral part of the test. So he did not go for it he continued to work, to earn the promised pay. However, he was paid nothing, and he was thrown out from the school.

14. The parents sent him for another communal school in the same area. There he had a fight with an other pupil who threatened him with a knife. David forced the knife from him and threw it away. The knife stuck high in the wall of a house. The other boy reported the case making him, David, looking guilty, and he was thrown out of this school as well. He remembers that in this school there was a pupil who had a device in his mouti. to adjust his teeths, and the boy used this device to make queer noises.

15. Then David was sent to a professional school, "art et Métier", in Chalon sur Marne. At this time his parents were living somewhere to the east of Paris. There David remained for 1,5 years and, again, was thrown out because he, instead going to classes went to the attick of the building and practicea there

throwing of a big knife. This was made noise, he was detected and thrown out.

16. In this school he belonged to the "leading" trio of the school, the others being an Italian Minizini,about 14, and a French boy Tellier (13).

Every Toursday and Saturday the school went for walks. Their supervisor probably had a girlfriend whom he visited during those walking periods, leaving the boys on their own. On one such a case the trio decided to for drinks in a tavern. They had all together 13 Francs and some sous. Everybody was bragging with his experiences with women, and it was decided to have women. However, er, Tellier, the youngest backed out, and so did linzini. fut ne, David, to show his manliness, went upstairs with the woman who asked 10 francs. The woman asked him to wash himself before the act. He did. The room was cold, and the water was cold, he nearly "lost" his penis. But, with the help of the woman, khwxxxkxxxx he managed the act, and felt proud when he returned to the others. However, since then he had a kind of mixed feelings toward the women, shiness, fear and attraction all together, and he did not have any of them for three years since then.

17. His father was agry with him because he again was thrown out of the school. Father told that he is good but for a hog-heard. But, nevertheless, he was sent to an other school, Ecole Breguet, for electrotechnicians, in 1937. But, there, also, he was thrown out.

18. Thereupon he left the parents home, lived for three months in an hotel and worked nightly in the railroad station, unloading the oysters. It was a cold job. The father took him back home and sent him to the school of photography and movie at the corner of Rue Littrée and Rue Vaugirard, close to an other school where he had been earlier. There he remained for two half-terms, Karch- July, and October - May, having not finished the course, because the German-Polish war started.

19. Sometimes between his going to Ecole Breguet and the school of photography he had stolen an English dictionary from a library. This came out, however, he was not put in jail. The only effect was that his normal identity papers of state-less person were withdrown and replaced by temporary papers which he had to renew every three months. He did not do this, and after 6 months he was taken and held by the police for 13 days before he was given new papers.

## C. Period of W II:

1.  In December 1939 David reported in Paris to a depot of the French Foreign Legion for voluntary service in the Legion. 15 days later he was sent to Lion, and from there,after one week stay, to Marseilles. From Marseilles he was shipped to Oran, and further sent to Sidi-Bel-Ables in Algier, then to Tunis, Sous, to the First Cavalry Regiment. There Lieutenant De WARREN sent him to courses for W:C:Os.

2.  Put soon an order was received to send all legionnaires-Georgians to EARCARES where special units had to be formed of diferent nationalities. At about 110 Georgians, and thousands of legionnaires of other nationalities were sent to Barcares. They remained idle, doing but very little exercising.

3.  After the German-French hostilities ended, those foreign-legionnaires were returned from Parcares to Paris and discharged, including David. He went back to his parents.

4.  He looked for work. A Georgian had recommended him to go to Germany where a Ceorgian Legion was being formed for the fight against the Soviets. Archilles GUEDEVANICHVILI was said being gathering people for this purpose. David's father told him that a Georgian MEDIA is the man who organizes this in connection with the Germans. David went to this man, had a talk with him, but did not like the idea.

5.  Then David reported to the German Labor Office in Paris, volunteering as an electrician for work in Germany. He was sent to POELITZ, near STETTIN, HIDRYER WERKE, with a contract for one year.

6.  He remained there for some three months: a mate of his, PASCAL (first name), did not like the work, and both decided to quit, to go "on leave".

7.  They had no valid German travel documents. It was impossible to travel with the identity card issued by the factory if there was leave certificate travel documents issued by the police. (NOTE: here the story is confused: as the debriefer recollects, David spoke on the first day of the ebriefing that he had help from a girlfriend who put into good German the text which he had prepared for the forged certificate of leave, to visit his sick uncle in Berlin. On the second day he revoked this, saying that this must have been a misunderstanding, he had spoken out of the chronological sequence, about a later case when he had help from a girlfriend.)

David went to the police in Stettin, and somehow managed to get the travel documents, valid until 2 June, to visit his sick uncle in Berlin (who did not exist at all).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 145

8. In Stettin David met a KEDIA-man, but again refused to join this organization, and he traveled to Berlin, met there some Georgians, spoke of going to Paris, was asked and took some letters for delivery in Paris and took the train up to Achen.

9. In Achen he asked a Frenchman how to get to France. He was advised that the German GESTAFO is giving necessary permits.

10. Now David falcified his leave permit, changing the validity date from 2 to 12 June, and went to GESTAPO. The falcification was not detected. However, he was not allowed to travel to Paris because his leave and travel document showed but Berlin as his place of destination, and he was ordered to return to Berlin.

11. Instead of returning to Berlin David took the train up to two km from EUPER, in order to pass the border in the EUPER-HALEDY area clandestinely. He asked somebody for advise how to cross the border, and he was sent to a man who agreed to take him over during the night time.

12. David had but 50 German Marks. He told this to the guide and asked how much he will have to pay him. The man asked 20 Marks. During the night the guide took him to a place, indicated David a direction and to follow for crossing the border and to arrive to the railroad station on the other side of the border. This was all he was offered for the 20 DM.

13. David waited until the guide left. Then, fearing that the guide could have directed him into a trap, he took a direction 90 degrees to the right of the advised direction, and followed this direction for about half an hour, and turned then 90 degrees to the left, thus into the old, advised direction. Originally he had had in mind to turn later once more to the left and thus to come back to some spot on the original direction just opposite of the place wherefrom he started his walk. However, when he had reached a road, he noticed a man on bycicle approaching towards him. He hid himself in the culvert, and when the man was quite close, he, David, jumped out, frightenend and stopped the man, then asked whether he is a good Frenchman. Receiving a positive reply, he then asked how to procede to the railroad station. The man showed him the direction to the next farm, and advised to ask for further information there - it would have been too complicated to advise for all the way. David thanked and left for the farm. The man, glad to escape from his charger, offered him some cigarettes.

14. David found nobody in the farm. He, thus, proceeded on his own, and finally reached the railroad station. Before boarding the train, he went to a barber, to shave and to clean his


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

-10-

clothes. He had but 32 German larks left. t. He asked the bar-
ber how much the railroad ticket air-Paris would cost, and
asked also to exchange his German Coney. He got the informa-
tion and the money exchanged. He had just enough for the ticket
with a few remaining for something to eat.

15. David bought the ticket and borded the train. He asked other
    travelers about the controls. ile was told that the German
    military tersonnel is performing the control at the Belgian-
    French border. ile thought to leave the train before the bor-
    der, to cross the border clandestirely and then return to the
    train, but it was too late, he could not leave the car any
    more, the control-team, a Lieutenant, a .C.O. and two man,
    was there already. The officer marched up to David, looked
    him into the eyes, then turned his back to David and shouted
    the ... to hurry up. David had luck: he had no documents,
    and nobody asked him for those: the .C.C. probably thought
    that the Lieutenant had checked his documents.

16. He felt happy, but the others told him that there will be
    one more check, at the "red zone" ( la zone rouge ) near
    SAINT QUAI. Thereupo: David left the compartment and ap-
    proached'in the coridor of the carla railroad employee. He
    showed the person his ticket, told that he has no documents,
    and demanded that the employee, as a good Frenchman, help
    him, another Frenchman, to come to Faris. ie was asked to
    wait. The employee soon returned with the chief of the train.
    The latter took David to the mail car of the train and ordered
    the employee in charge of this car to find a place for David
    to hide. A mail sack was opened and David was instructed to
    get in. David did, and felt so secure and comfortably that he
    fell asleep. He remembers having herd some shouting and kick-
    ingaround, however, he was not hit. He was in Paris when the
    sack was opened. He felt very ix happy, offered money, but he
    was told that this was not made for money. He then promised
    to give the man some drinks, but in the excitement he forgot
    this. When he later remembered this and returned to the station
    he did not find the person any more.

17. Two or three days later David again reported to a German
    Labor Office in Paris, this time as a photographer. He, of
    course, did not go to the same office where he had been before,
    where they could have recognized him.

18. He got the assignment into a factory in Berlin, which produ-
    ced electrodes wor welding instruments. He had to photograph
    samples of material used, and of electrodes produced, for check-
    ing purposes, under different conditions. He also had to make
    photocopies of different books, and photographs for the identi-
    ty cards. The factory was somethete in LICHTENBERG, not quite
    in Berlin (the next day David said that the factory was in
    FRIEDEAU). He does not remember the name of the factory, but
    he heard the director answering telephone calls by saying


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

-11-

JOHO or JOHIO and, thus, he learned that this was the mare of the director. He does not remember the address of the place where he lived.

19. In this factory there was a chemical laboratory with a Dutch laborant. This mar showed David some guales made of platica, which he said said using for different mixing work. Later some of these bowds were stolen.de, He, David, was suspected, and his living place was searched, but - he had not taken those bowels.

20. Later he got in trouble because he had been to movie with a German girl. An other girl, who was jealous, had reported this, and he was fired: a foreigner had no right to go with a German girl. However, this discharge was made to be "honorab- le", and he could apply for a new job.

21. David went to the Labor Office, showed his discharge papers, and was directed to a factory in the STAELSCHREIBERSTRASSE, Perlin, Koritsplatz. The factory was producing steel ammunition belts for aircraft maschine guns. The technics used in this factory were primitive. David invented a simple machine for adjustment of the right grip necessary to hold the cart- ridges in the belt. The director was much pleased.

222 In Ferlin David met PASCAL again. They both got the idea that it is enough for them of the life in Germany, and they decided to go to South America, to Erazil.

23. They needed passports, such for foreigners. To get those, they needed certificates of leave from their working places. Thus, David went to a Labor Office, to the prettiest girl,and asked for two leave certificates. The girl was obliging,how- ever said, that the factory must issue the certificates, not the Labor Office. David then explained that he was misunderstee stood, that he did not ask for the certificates, but for the blank forms, so he could bring those to the factory. He got the forms, filled the in, forged an imprint of the stamp of the factory by copying it over an electric bulb, stole himself during the night into the office of the foreman and made an other imprint with a cachet found there. It was easy for him to enter the office because he was living in the same building with the factory, and when he needed warm water for washing, he had to go to the upper story for opening the valve, and from there it was close to the "studio" or workshop (atel- ier): there was not much danger of being seen by the night guard as the operation did not take long time.

24. With the leave certificates ready, David returned to the same girl in the Labor Office from whom he had received the forms. The obliging girl stamped the certificates "registered", antered their names irto a carifile, and thus, David and Fas-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

25. cal had officially certified (by the Labor Office) permits of leave to solicit fer the Passports for Foreigners.

They got the passports, and they traveled to Paris. David saw there his mother, mi spoke her of his intention to go to Crazil. This was 1 19-2.

26. David and Pascal decided to co via Spair and Portugal. David bought a map, and they started. They crossed the border to Spain, and got into trouble then, because robody wanted to exchange their Gera marcorer, the could not even buy food. Thus, they decided to return to France.

27. When they were for some 500 meter back in France, they were seen by the German custom guards. They were arrested, separatedand pu I put into cells in a cellar. Fortunately, the wall between the two adjacent cells into which they were put, was so thin that they could conversate with each other.

28. David, afraid that Pascal could say something wrong when interrogated separately, advised him to say, when asked, that it was David who bought the map. and it really happened that Pascal was questioned first, and he, duly instructed by David, could give co-ordinated answers.

29. He, David, was brought to a lieutenant who made a thorough search, looked into his watch, and even into his rectum. However, the lieutenant was polite and friendly. David gave some explanation for being in this area - visiting somebody, whereupon the lieutenant said that the pasport authorized David to travel up to Faris only.

30. They were ordered to return to Paris. One KCO was ordered to accompany them to the railroad station and to see that they really will depart for Paris. They went to the station. The iCo ordered tickets for then: Fayonne - Paris. At the same moment the NCO was called by a friend away from the counter. David quickly used the opportunity and asked the clerk at the counter not to give them tickets to Paris, but instead to FAU, a station some 10 from the border of the free, unoccupied part of France. The clerk objected first, saying that the NCO ordered the tickets to Faris, but David quickly persuaded him "to help other Frenchmen against the Gestapo-man". He got the right tickets. The R.C.C. returned, saw them off, but, of course, he did not know that David got the tickets to Pau, not to Paris.

31. They came to the border. A Frenchman advised them how to get over the border - everybody was ready to help them. They went, but soon got stuck in mud, and David lost one of his shoes. It was dark, he could not retrack it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

-13-

32. Then they were stopped by the French gendarmes who thought that they were Germans. David quickly inverted the story of their flight from the occupied zone for joining the Free French Legion. The gendarmes took then to a village where David could buy a pair of shoes, but alas, canvas shoe only, and of too large size. Then they were directed to a company of that Legion, to vic. The chief of this company gave then a horse cart to go to the regimental ... in arseilles, Camp de Sainte Marthe

33. There arrived, David advised Fascal to go to the registrar the first, so they both could see whether he, as a Frenchman, will be accepted without showing his German passport. David, being a Georgian, did not want to go the first.
    Pascal went. is story was not believed. To prove his being a Frenchman and not a German as suspected, he showed his German passport for foreigners. This made the situation worse, and Pascal was happy to get out without being arrested.

34. Both retreated. David decided to return to Faris. Pascal did not want to return and said that he will go to Algiers, to get a job on the construction of the Algiers - Nigeria railroad. They departed.

35. David, on his way back to Paris, reached Lion. There he went to one of his far relatives, Giga TZITZICHVILI, and asked whether the latter could help him to get a permit to go to the German-occupied Paris. Guiga thought this being a simple matter, because he had a good friend in the Security (Sureté). However, the relative failed, nearly got in trouble himself, and advised David to dissappear quickly, what the latter did.

36. Somehow David managed to pass the French control by showing his German passport. The guard misunderstood his difficult name, and let him pass as Corporal Fritz VILI.

37. But the German post stopped him, David, and started a sking different questions. David demanded to be brought to the chief of guards. He was taken to a ...c., whom he, again, asked to be brought to an officer. He was brought to a "Sturmbanführer" (Major in the S3). David explained to this officer something of having visited his brother in Marseilles. The officer nicely helped him to return to Paris.

38. Back in Faris, David went to the parents. The mother mocked him about his quick return from Brazil.

39. Soon David reported to the German Commandantura in Paris, to volunteer as a driver to the ..., the Transportation Corps of the Kazy Party. He was accepted and sent to Berlin, MUGEL-HEIM LAGER, close to OSTAREUTE. He knew to drive, he had a driver's license since 1938.
    After some three or four months of training they were distri-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 150

-14-

buted to different places in Ferlin. He came to a unit stationed close to the BRANDENBURGER TOR, vis-a-vis to the French Embassy building, where he had to walt and drive a cab for eight hours the day. He lived in the same house in front of which their cars were stationed. re does not remember any names from the time of this training period. One of his co-drivers in this small unit was ROVIKOF.

4C. David remained in this drivers unit in Berlin until,some three to four months later volunteers were called to go to France, as lorry-drivers to the West coast where the Atlantic Wall was being constructed. He volunteered, and 15 days later, together with other volunteers, he was sent to Paris.

4l. In Paris they were given French-made Fords of five ton loading capacity (C U - charge utile). The convoy of some 50 cars, each with two drivers, started in direction to SAINT NAZAIRE. At the departure, still in Faris, close to Porte d'Orleans, one driver had an accidence: he could not take the curb, drove on the sidewalk, killed and damaged a few people, without damaging the car. David, who interpreted at the spot when the case was cleared, was ordered to take this car over, because the driver who just had the accidence, was not allowed to continue to drive immediately.

42. The convoy was divided into three parts, with David going to the detaciment which was detailed to the Navy. Thiswas approximately at the time when the British made a mock landing or a demonstration of a landing..

43. In 1943, still on the French West coast, the NSK men were ordered to take an oath. David refused, and as the consequence, was sent back to Derlin, guarded by two men, into a NSK penal or refractory camp.

44. David asked the leader of this camp, an"Obersharführer" (equivalent to a .C.C.),/ later Davida changed the grade to "Hauptsturmführer" - equivalent to a Captain/, for permission to contact the Police Headquarters, for volunteering into the police service. The campleañer granted his six-hour leave to settle his employment with the police, or to face a tough deal because of his refusal to take the oath.

45. David went to the Folice H.Q. at ALEXANDERE LATZ in Berlin, was accepted and given a note that he had registered for the service in the Police. He returned with this note to the S camp, and on the next morning he was released on ground of this note.

undergo

46. In the Police David had to take physical examination in a SS and Police hospital. ile was found fit physically and was sent into barracks of which he does not remember the aidress. iis grade in the police was "Rott-Wachtmeister - Dolmetscher" - something as the second-lowest grade in the ordinary police,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

-15-

, the SCURO (Schutzpolizei). The "Dolmetscher" si-ply indi-
cated that he was a foreigner, as the knowledge of languages
was the only reason why foreigners could be employed by the
police. lie had nothing to do with interpreting or translating.
They did some exercising and made centry duty at a large
petrol store. lis hours on duty were, by 24-hour spells: 1300
to 1300, then off up to the next day, 0800 to Srand off up
to the next day,1300, and so one for a week. In the next week
the same pattern repeated, but the start being at 1000 h.

47. In summer, during an exercise of physical training, a man
    who had to catch David when he was coming down from a high
    flight into which he was thrown by two men, the catcher got
    frightened, backed out, David, as a concequence, fell to the
    ground, and broke one arm, the elbow, and damaged the other
    arm. He remained for some 40 days in hospital, the same in
    which he had the physical examination when entering the police
    service.

48. When released from the hospital, he was given a convales-
    sence certificate which kept him free of work. He had to go
    periodically for checks and for renewal of this certificate.
    After he had been for those checks and renewals for a few ti-
    mes, he started to forge the signature of the physician and
    "renewed" the certificate himself.

49. During his stay with the police force in Berlin, and also
    when he was "convalessing", he had a private room hired at
    KURFÜRSTENDA 26, or "no. exactly" 26 - he said not the to
    remember the exact number of the house.

50. Then he got the idea to falcify a document releaving him
    for a longer period of time from checks with the police unit.
    This had to be a certificate showing that he had to undergo
    a "surgical operation" which will take at least three months.

51. He had a girlfriend, Asterée SCHMIDT-AZI-BADASSI, a half-
    Azerbaijan, who was fluent in German and in French. David as-
    ked her to put the medical certificate into good official
    German. Then he forged the cachets and the signature of the
    physician, the same who had written the renewals of his dis-
    ability certificate.

52. He presented this forged certificate to a clerk in the offi-
    ce of his police unit. He was on good terms with the clerks
    there, he was a "friendly foreigner" who joked and spoke abou
    Paris. This clerk took a short look on the certificate, made
    corresponding notes in his files, and this was enough for David
    for the case that somebody would ask about his whereabouts:
    he did not need to rely any more on the forged document: the
    clerk had made an official entry into the books, and there
    was no way to check, neither to doubt ix this entry.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

53. During those three months of "surgical operation" David get in contact will Frakli LORDIPALIDZE, a boyfriend of his sister Helen who worked with the East-inistry (Cst-iriste-rium). Irakly, who worked with the "SD" (Sicherheitsdienst,-Security Service), and who later married Helen, had just received order to go to Paris.

54. David asked Irakli to give his travel document or order for a short time to him, so he could show those to his superior and to ask for similar ones. Irakli obliged. David photographed the documents - he had no intention to show those to his boss, he was going to make his own documents.

55. is sister brought him some forms which were used in the Ost-Ministerium, and he collected others more from different offices.

56. Thus, David prepared for himself a falcified travel document to Paris, signing it with the name of Police President RADEMANN. This name he has used on many documents in later times.

57,7. Before using this document he checked it, or made a rehearsal with his girlfriend. ile gave the falcified document to the girl for inspection, and then, soon after this, he pushed his genuine police passport above the false paper, asking the girl about her reaction and findings. She said that she had understood that the first paper was a travel order, but she had not had enough time to read it through, in full. This, David explained, was the trick: one has to give the falcified paper first, and then, without giving the checker enough time for its study, insert an other, genuine doccument which would attire the attention of the checker, detract it from the falcified one.

58. David used this trick with the controls and had a smoth journey to Paris.

59. In Paris David contacted the engraver ALLCU, corner of the streets Due Pilies da Calvaire and Peawareciais. He asked Allou to prepare for his a seal of the German Leadquarters. The man consented after a short hesitation, after David had spoken of Frenchmen's moral duty to help other Frenchmen against the Germans. The same man made for David later many more seals and stamps of different German offices, like the Security Service, the East-Ministry, the Labor Office the Police ileadquarters and the travel permission stamp for the passports.

60. By the intermediary of this ALLOU David let also be printed different forged letter- and order-forms of the above mentioned offices, in thousands of copies, sofar those did not have filigéee nets printed in. However, he personally was able


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 153

to prepare by hand the filigree net if the document needed it.

61. To the question of the debriefer concerning the expenses
    of all this immense work, David explained that all this cos-
    ted him over 100 000 French rancs. Later he changed this sum
    to 140.00 to 150.000 F.Francs

62. At first he made money by reselling golden watches of his
    friends, as well as smother objects, receiving good gains.

63. Then he had three friends in Berlin, French radio-engineers
    who had been brought to compulsory works to Germany but later
    released. The last names names of those Friends were: LUCAS, ALLUMES
    and VILENAL. Lucas and Vilemain wanted to have traveldocu-
    ments to Paris. The father of Lucas was a wealthy man in
    Paris.

64. When David was preparing for his own journey to Paris, he
    let Lucas write a letter to his father, asking him to give
    David 200,000 Francs. The father obliged.

65. Besides, and e specially after he had his caches ready, he
    earned plenty of money through his operations on the black-
    market, buying coffe at the French-Spanish frontier for 50 Ger-
    man Marks the kilogram, and reselling it in Berlin for 900 to
    1200 Mark the kg.

66. He personally had made 3 or 4 trips to the Spanish border
    for coffee, and four other men have done this for him.

67. Those trips were easy, especially the French part of them
    on which were no special checks. For were the trips dangerous
    because the luggage of military personnel was not searched,
    and nor was the luggage of police force.

68. When making and using these confeit seals, one had to pay
    attention to the number of the unit in the seal which to use:
    those numbers referred to the type of the work and the impor-
    tance of the offices, f.i. "lc" woul show that the seal was
    of an unimportant small office, whereas the right number to
    use was perhaps three or four.

69. Before letting LUCAS to use the forged papers, David wanted
    to check the papers on somebody else.

70. David had a half-Jew pal ATZ-DISHANN. His mother, born
    HAAY, Hungarian, had married a Jew Katz, and later, in a se-
    cond marriage Dissmann. A son from this first marriage was
    now using the name of DISS, however, was urder the pressu-
    re of a certain WERERT who knew of his Jewish origin.
    Katz asked David to prepare papers for the Spaniard WERWERT
    for an official trip to Spain. David agreed, however asked fe
    two old genuine Spanish passports for this purpose.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

-18-

71. He got the old passports, those could be easily bought on black market, and out of those two passports he made a new one for Werwert.

72. David went into details in describing how he prepared the passport, especially how he exchanged the photograps which was fixed by groumets, and thus, could not be removed and simply replaced. He had to use plenty of skilled washing and master-photography for remouving the old image and replacing it by the new one without damaging the passport, nor the "photograph" itself.

73. Werwert used the passport. He was instructed by Katz to report in Spain to a priest who was in contact with Katz. The signal from the priest came, Werwert had arrived without trouble. At this occasion Katz disclosed to David that Werwert was not a Spaniard, as pretended, but a Cerman.

74. How David prepared the documents for Lucas and Vilemain: to report as specialists to the Labor Office in Paris.

75. David had arranged with Lucas to acknowledge his safe arrival in Paris. The woman, in whose house the Lucas'es lived in Paris, was working in the German Commandantura in Paris. Through her David learned to know the name and the address of the family of a german soldier operator of the switch-board of the Comandantura in Paris. The family lived in Berlin. Some coffee was given to the soldier and he was urged to phone his wife in berlin and to tell that he had received some coffee for her. This was the signal announcing safe arrival of Lucas in Paris. David told that this signal was used in some ten cases.

76. David had issued false travel documents to some 14 persons. One of them was a friend of Lucas in Berlin, whose name and home address were: Henry JOIGNY, 5, Rue Jaretti, Paris XV.

77. Somehow David became an idea to join the "ABER" of the German Armed Forces, something more important and exiting than his previous activities. He had no good idea of the real scope and of the structure of the "Abwehr". He went to the house of "ANT AWEHR, OK" in the WILHELMSTRASSE. The porter at the entrance asked him to which branch he wanted to go. David toid "West" whereupon the porter had said that he should go to" West Finz (I West), and instructed him into which room to go. There David found an officer wo explained to him that the office had been moved to Ta, in POTZDA

78. David went to Potzdam. It took him hours until he found TAKE, an area surrounded by barbed wire, heavily guarded, all guards being .C.Cs. He showed his police passport and asked to be brought to the chief of the guards. He was brou-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 155

-19-

brought to a Lieutenant who took him to a Colonel. The latter, having heard that David wanted to get employed, this means that he did not belong to the organization, got mad, did not believe that an unauthorized person could have penetrated so far, (into a top secret area), and asked how he learned about the place. David told his story. The colonel checked on phone with the police H. and got the reply that they have such a man. David, then was asked what he could do, his name was registered, and he was told that he will be contacted later.

79. Through a chain of persons, linked to LUCAS, David got a request to prepare documents for a Belgian girl's journey to Paris. He consented.

80. He met the girl, like many other persons, outside of his living place, on different places, and under good security precautions, f.i.: somebody entered the meeting place on his behalf and asked the person who was awaiting him to come out. David, was at that time out observing the environs, to see whether somebody would be surveilling his two persons. If them was no surveillance, then he followed his people, approached them in a safe place. He never brought them to his living place. But LUCAS and VILEMAIN had been to his quarters.

81. Before he had finished the documents for the Belgian girl, he and ALLUMES had found after an airraid, an unexploded incendiary bomb. Allumes had explained that such a bomb, having not exploded when coming down, is harmless. They took the bomb to David's living place, and David, cautiously, tried to take out the capsule. The capsule exploded. The thumb and the fore- finger of his left hand were damaged, and Allumes got a splinter into his face. The landlady was mad: the fools are playing with bombs, ruining her hause which was saved in the airraid. She wanted to report them to the police, but David calmed her down, saying that he himself will report the case, he himself is a policeman, a.s.o.

82. At the same time the Belgian girl happened to come and saw David injured. She showed no grief because of the paines caused to David and the loss of his fingertips, - she was angry that she could not have her papers and could, thus, not start her pleasure trip to Paris.

83. It took injured David three days until the documents for the girl were ready, and an appointment was made to meet her in the ANHALTER BAHNHOF wherefrom the trains to Paris were starting after the Potsdamer Bahnhof was demolished. The meeting was fixed for 2200h.

84. David went for the meeting together with ALLUMES, KATZ and ASTEREE. They found the station rather empty and they thought that they had come too early. But then David noticed the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 156

Belgian girl just at the platform gate. He approached her. She told David that he will be arrested immediately, and indeed, all around there came men with machine pistols ready. All but the Belgian girl were arrested, and hold separately. his was on 22 February 1944.

85. David was held for a few days in a room chained by his right hand (the undamaged hand) to a heater. Nobody spoke a single word with him. He was brought some food like it is being made with a dog.

86. ilis injured hand was not cared for at all and started to fester. when he lamented about this, he was transferred to a hospital where he was put into a large ward together with many more people.

87. le noticed a telephone in the coridor of the hospital. He askedja coin from a Dutch patient and phoned to the Belgian gerl, asking her to bring him some civilian clothes. He still did not believe that this girl had betried him.

88. The girl promised to come to see him the next day at 1000H. He sure, got a visit the next day at 10, but by guards who took him to the hospital in TEGEL jail. Now it was clear to David that the Belgian girl was in contact with the German police..

89. From the Tegel jail he was daily taken for questioning to the police H.Q.

90. A few months later, when his fingers had nearly healed, he was trensferred into a cellar of the police il..

91. His questionning continued for nine months, with the sessions at first daily, then two to three times a week, later once in a week or biweekly. The charges were heavy: grave forgery, damaging the security of the state, demoralization of the foreign laborers, helping the POW to flee, and espionage (some photos of the bomb-damaged Berlin were found in his living place).

92. Sometimes before his arrest, David had organized the move of his parents and sister from Berlin to Vienna, of course with forged traveldocuments, however, the family being not aware of the falcifications.

93. After his arrest the parents came from Vienna to see him. He does not know whether they were brought by the authorities or did they come at their own initiative. The evidences of his crimes were displayed in the same room where he met his father. It was then that the father learned that he, David, had forged the traveldocuments for the move of the family, that there was no police president Rademann whose name the documents showed, that David had invented this name. His


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 157

father was very much embarrassed

94. During the interrogations David was asked many times for whom he did all those things, for which intelligence service nobody believed that a single person could have achieved so much without any big foreign service behind him.

95. The police inspectors had hinted him that he would not escape the death sentence. To gain time, he wrote a letter to "00008" and reported an invention of his: a motor which worked without gas, - in those days, Germus being very short of gas, such an invention should attire attention.

96. He was contacted and asked for details of his invention. He told something and requested better living conditions and focd, so he would be able to work on this invention. He also mentioned that some details of the invention are in Vienna and should be brought from there to Ferlin. (At that time Vienna was already occupied by the Russians). Later two specialists were sent to him, to check his information. They found that the idea was acceptable theoretically, and he was urged to continue to work on it.

97. In connection with the approach of the front to Berlin, they, this means David, Katz and allumes, were transferred to WOLFENFUTTEL jail, near HANNOVER. He does not know what happened to Asterée.

98. In Wolfenbuttel they remained for some three months, until the Americans freed them in April 1945.

99. They went together to KASSEL Discharge Camp, wherefrom he and allumes went to Paris, whereas Katz went his own way.

D. Additional explanations to the activities during WW II.

1.  The photographs which David had made of the documents of Irakli Lordkepanidze were not good enough. So he had to enlarge the photos as much as he could, up to the size of a few square feet. He amelicrated the enlarging by some pencil work. Then he re-photographed the enlarging and produced new, good photos of the documents in the exactly right size of the original documents.

2.  All the photographic lab work was done in his hotel room. He used two MINOXes and one CONTAX, and a French type enlarger with the objective of his Contax. The equipment costed him over 100,000 ( it was not specified whether French Francs or German Harks).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 158

3. David's father needed money for his inventions. David gave him 100,030 D through a third person, his father not knowing from whom the money came. This was before David's "Journey to Brazil!"

4. David had plenty of money, mostly earned by selling coffee on black market. Once he has bought in Berlin for ten kg coffee a car, an Opel.

5. The Georgians in Berlin did not know of his doings and relations in Berlin much, although he fixed with the, nor did ADIA know anything and was puzzled by this. When arranging the wedding party of his sister, in Jay-June 1942, he asked Media for his car. The request was refused. David, then, hired 4 or 5 cars for a full day (paying with coffee), and it happened that Media saw him coming with his caravan of cars, loaded with vines and other good things which he had bought black for the feast. Media had asked him about the caravan, and David had replied that Media can now see that David can have as many cars as he just likes, although Nadia did not give his when asked.

6. For the move of his parents from Berlin to Vienna David had reserved an appartment in the train, again using false documents. To this he said that it is difficult to get reserved a seat for one person in a train, but it is easier to reserve a full appartment of a car for one person, or a complete railroad car or train for a special reason, because the greater the request, the higher authorities make the request, the higher authorities decide the issue, the less effective is the factual check of the genuity of the request and of the documents by which the request is made.

7. As to the motives of his not joining the Georgian Legion: He, David, does not feel being a Georgian, or too much of a Georgian. He hates the Russians in general, although he has nothing special against any particular Russian. The Russian communists he dislikes even more than the ordinary Russians. There was no real reason why he did not join the Media group- he simply disliked the idea. NOTE: this contradicts with his statements made during the first day of the debriefing, according to which he was ready to fight together with anybody (even with the devil's grandmother) against the communists.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 159

## The Feriod after **II**:

1.  After the return from Assel Discharging Camp David wanted to register in Paris as a Frenchman, using the name of DATTO. However, a woman servant of the hotel thought to have recognized in him his brother Achilles Tzitzic-Vili. The Sureté Militaire was contacted. David had to give the names of the people whom he had helped during the war against the Germans. Finally, he was released, however not allowed to use the name of DATTO.

2.  David's parents and his sister Elen with his husband Irakli (NOTE: their children were not mentioned by David) returned from Vienna to Paris in 1946, helped by Achilles.

3.  In Paris David worked with Jaques CARPS, 166 Boulevard Voltaire.

4.  He learned to know Renée PARROD, and married her. He has not seen her since 1950. (for details see 2.).

5.  In Paris Jean ADAN contacted David again and asked him to participate in a hold-up. He refused, reasoning that his mother would die if she would learn of this.

6.  David's mother died in 1948, and some two months later his father and sister with her husband returned to the USSR.

7.  After the death of David's mother Jean Adam contacted David again, and insisted on his participation in the hold-up in a jewelry. David consented.

8.  To start with the hold-up, they needed a car. They hired a taxi for a drive to Clamart, some 10-12 km from Paris. When the car was passing through a forest, David drew his pistol and forced the driver to stop and to abandon his car. The driver was promised that no harm would be done to him if he obliges.

9.  They parked the car close to the jewelry shop which they planned to rob. Jean went over the street, and watched the window of the jewelry shop. David entered the shop and asked to show him a ring which was in the window. When the shop-keeper opened the window, this being an agreed signal, Jean entered the shop. David pulled the pistol, and they looted the shop. They fled in the car which they later left near the police station, with a 500 Francs bill pinned to the driver's seat - reimbursement for having used the car.

10. One month later they tried another hold-up, but this did not work. David did not want to continue such things and told this to Jean. David's wife did not like his contact with Jean, although she did not know anything about their common doings.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 160

11. One year later Jean Adam approached David again and blackmailed him into continuing to participate in his roberies: he threatened to tell everything to David's wife if the latter would not cooperate. David went along.

12. Jean had no plans ready, but he needed money. First they planned to rob somebody whom they would have seen receiving plenty of money from some bank. They tried to watch at different banks, but they could not see from the street through the windows up to the counters.

13. To help out, they equipped their car with a concealed periscope, and they could see better. But this too, did not help: David at the periscope had never enough time to describe the person to Jean well enough so he could recognize and attack him, or the person went in a "wrong" direction where he could not be attacked.

14. They had no difficulties with the car, although this was stolen. They parked the car in the courtyard of the police headquarters, together with the cars of the policemen and of some other private persons. Besides, the car was foreseen with a forged registration plate, showing the number of a well honorable person.

15. At last they decided to make an ordinary hold-up in a bank. Everything went smoothly. This was in June 1950.

16. Soon after this Jean attired the attention of the authorities by too lavishly life. He was arrested and confessed, implicating David also.

17. David fled, but was arrested when trying to pass the French-Spanish border.

18. David was sentenced to 7 years in jail.

19. His wife requested and got divorced. She was pregnant at that time and in Nov.1950 gave birth to their son Gabriel.

20. David was hold successively in the following prisons: Paris, Prison de la Santée for 2.5 years, later at Fresnes, Poissy, Fion, Mines and Avignon.

21. The sentence was shortened by 10 on the occasion of the election of the new President of the Republic. Three month he got granted for good conduct.

22. David said having never been cut for gain: he had made all this for excitement. He did not like roberies because there one had to threaten, or even to use weapons against, innocent people. He has often had boxes full of money, not knowing what to do with it. If now consenting to do things for the Americans, he he would not ask for money, he would take what he will be offered

## ANALYSIS.

1.  The debriefer was instructed to conduct the debriefing in a most friendly way, so that David would not get suspicious about the purpose of this debriefing.

2.  David was asked by Charles to tell the debriefer his full story, so that this could be used in planning of the cover-story for his future activities.

3.  In compliance with those instructions, the debriefer gave David full freedom of telling the story in his own choosen way, without being much interrupted. He was asked but a few explanatory questions, sofar those could be inserted without causing any suspicion, and sofar the debriefer was in the situation to put those intelligently: he himself did not have much advance information on David. In some cases David asked whether an item he was just telling, was important or necessary for the planning of his coverstory, what in most cases was confirmed.

4.  However, David did not give the full story in its details. Besides, there are some contradictions between the different parts of his story. Some events, as described by him, seem to be unbelievable.

5.  Unfortunately, the debriefer is not in command of short-hand, and he had no support of consealed tape-recording. Thus, short key-notes and the memory of the debriefer were the only sources of information when the debriefing report was later written. Due to this, some details of the story got lest or confused, especially when it appeared that David changed some details during the second session of the debriefing.

6.  To clear those points, additional questions should be asked. Some of those questions can still be asked without alar-wing David's suspicions, whereas others are of a kind which would certainly show David that those are asked for control purposes. This should be born in mind when drafting the final list of additional questions, and when deciding the conditions under which those shall be asked.

7.  The here given list of additional questions is but a tentative one, drafted on the basis of this one debriefing report only. (See: K,1 and 2.)

The capital letters and the numbers in front of each question refer to the corresponding items in this debriefing record, or, if such items do not exist, indicate the need to cover additional items.

The small letters are for later references to the additional answers or sub-items.

## G. CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS IN HIS ACTIVITY

### 1. Irrational instability.

As a child he gets thrown out of six schools for having done nonsense. ( Ref.: B 7,12,13,14,15,17.)

Nor does he finish the last, the photography and movie school, although he is about 21 years of age and should, thus, be able to think for himself. ( B 18.)

Instead, he volunteers into the French Foreign Legion, thus, going in war against the Germans. (C 1.)

Later he volunteers for work in Germany, stays on jobs 3 to 4 months then flees the country ( twice ), and after a few days out of Germany, volunteers again for work there, all without any good, compelling reason.( C 18,22; 39,40.)

The reasons for changing his jobs when in Germany or with the Germans, and the situations in which he changes or contemplates to change his jobs, are unreasonable, if not unbelievable. (C 45, 77.)

### 2. Lack of motivation.

He thinks that during the school age it was the inferiority complex that made him do nonsense: he wanted to show up despite being small in growth and having a funny name, (B 7a, 16.)

He is not doing anything for material gain, he has done none of his special activities for money, and he won't do this in the future. ( E 22).

He has no ideological motivation, neither patriotic, nor enough political feelings: he does not feel being a Georgian, he is not interested in the Georgian Throne, he has partly for- gotten the Georgian language, and he wanted to register as a Frenchman. (A1; E 1.)

Although he"hates the Russians in General", and even more the Soviet-Russians, this hatred was not strong enough to make him join the German-sponsored Georgian anti-Soviet unit. (C 4,8.)

His longing for thrill and excitement, the single remaining motivation, seems to be limited to the more-or-less.comfortable, physically easy activities, like forging of documents, and fooling officials with those documents, playing a wise man who acts according to his psychological tricks. (C 24,36,37,57; D 6.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 171

This love of excitement was not strong enough, just as was not the political motivation, to bring him to more dangerous, and more demanding acts.(C 4, 8; E 2.)

Besides, this longing for excitements has decreased with the age. When during the school age he did not care what his parents felt when he was being thorwn out of all schools, when he caused brands, stole, was arrested by the police (B6,19) and when in 1939 he was bold enough to volunteer to the Foreign legion, then, in later years, he is not so bold any longer,as mentioned before, and he is held back by the thought of his mother's and his wife s feelings. ( Е 5, 10.) He even needs the repeated approaches of Jean Adamx, and coersion,to get over the restraining influence of his wife.

During the debriefing, although he was left in full freedom to tell his story, to feel, to live it once more, he did not show any excitement; he spoke as if telling the story of an other person, leaving the impression of a man weary of his turbulent past, possibly longing for the family (he mentioned having not seen his wife since 1950)...

3. Lack of initiative.

His troubles in the schools seem having started when he got acquainted with Jean ADAM whose plans he followed, although he "was sure that he could have made better plans".(В 11.)

In Germany he had PASCAL who did not like the jobs, spoke of leaving those, whereupon"they"then decided to flee. (C 6,22.)

Later Jean ADAM is back again with his bad ideas and in- tentions, even blackmailing David into action.( E 5, 11.)

4. Lack of planning.

He often acts under the effect of a momentary thought, without planning, or he changes the plans if there were any.

Sometimes those acts or changes are just ridiculous, and show how bad was the "planning" itself. (C 26, 30,34.)

Thereby he neglects the neccessary security precautions, and takes unneccessary risks. (C 10, 13, 16, 17, 77, 78, 81, 84, 87, E 1.)

Sometimes, when his "plan" does not work, he gets lost and remains inactive, lets things go their own way. (C 15.)

# H. RELIABILITY OF THE STORY.

1. His story gets unbelievable because too often:

a/ he has "good luck" which helps him (C 15,16,27,30,78,a.o.),

b/ his opponent is stupidly derelict, which enables David always to come out a winner, to escape the danger of being captured. (C 10,23,23,29,36,37,44,45,52,58,77.)

2. There are statements in his story which are not well believable, f.i.:

- that he and Pascal got leave- or travel-documents from the Police in Stettin without having had any leave certificate from the factory; or that he,having been only for a few months in Germany, knew the language well enough and could prepare forged leave certificates for himself and Pascal. (C 7.)

- that he does not remember where he did live in Berlin when employed as a photographer, when this place was searched.(C 18)

- that "Passports for Foreigners" were issued by the German authorities so easily, without any checks, on so lomited purpose as was theirs: only for a short leave in Paris. (C 25, 29.)

- His tutoring of Pascalconcerning the map:this was not necessary at all, because it really was hea, David, who bought the map, Pascal could not have stated wrongly. (C 28.).

- that he was allowed to go from the NSKK penal camp to Police H.; that the Police engaged him without any investigation of his past; that the NSKK penal camp released him simply on the basis of a note that he had registered for work with the Police. (C 44-46.)

- that he, at this time, knew the trick with the combination of a false and a true document, (C 57.) and -

- that the higher an officer, the easier is to fool him (D 6), that one has to use the "lack of link" between different authorities: to present alforged)document of one authority to an officer of an other authority, who would not find the forging. (This was mentioned in connection with D 6.)

- that the officer in OKW ABW gave him the top-secret location of the installation without having asked for the purpose of his visit. (C 77.)

- that he was so security conscious and did not meet the patrons in his living place, that the "Belgian girl", Allumes and others had not been to this place before. (C 80,81,82.)

- that he had ordered through Allou forged letter-forms of different offices by thousands of copies.(60).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 173

J. SECURITY RISK.

1. Whether the story is right or invented, or "beautified", there are points in it which indicate to some security risks connected with this person:

2. His father, sister, her husband, and probably their children are in the USSR, whereto they repatriated from France in 1948.(A3)

3. His father, although a theoretical "pretender to the Throne of Georgia", is in so good relation with, and so well trusted by, the communists government of the USSR and of Soviet Georgia, that he is allowed to live permanently (over 10 years) in Tiflis, Georgia. (A 3.)

4. His cousin Mathée Keresselidze, who was sent by the Germans as a spy to USSR, was caught there, and sentenced to 15 years in prison or hard labor, was later free to come to Moscow and to repatriate to France. (A 7.)

5. His sister Helen, after she repatriated, was used by the communists as a teacher of languages in Georgia. Then, convicted for insulting talk about Stalin, and sentenced to 5 years in a detention area, she was later vindicated, received retroactively the salary for those five years, was allowed to come back to Tiflis, was occasionally at the same time in Moscow when Nathée was there, and they, occasionally, met there. (A 5.)

6. Helen's husband Irakli Lordkipanidze, a former German SD man, repatriated to USSR together with his wife. (See p.l above.) However, Mathé shall allegedly having heard nothing about his fathe when he met Helen in Moscow. ( A 7.)

7. Such things happen sometimes, but they are far from belonging to everyday's pattern in Soviet life. The concentration of all those happenings on a very limited circle of David's relatives could hardly be occasional. This should have special reasons.

8. The question arises: If this concentration is not occasional, then what is its purpose or reason, and how much is David involved?

9. Concerning David himself:

a/ According to this story he has acted in so many cases imprudently, just relaying on his "good luck" only, and the stupidity of his opponents, that this could have developed into a habit of his.

b/ He has spoker of having been very cautious and security minded when taking people to his living place (that only two friends have been there), and when meeting people. (C 80.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 174

-38-

But he, probably, has not thought of how dangerous it was for him to re-register two times in Paris under his right name for re-employment in Germany after he had abandoned there two working places. For has he thought how dangerous it was for him to visit his parents or those occasions in Faris, at the addresses on which he might have been wanted, while these addresses,probably, were registered as his home addresses when he applied for work In Germany.

c/ David has shown during the debriefing broad knowledge of different advanced techniques and tactics of clandestine work, which he claims having used. If believing his story, then the question arises: where could he have learned all this knowledge at that early time, before 1944?

d/ The incident of having instructed Pascal through the cellar wall what to say during the interrogation about the map, with no other items mentioned on what more he had instructed Pascal at the same occasion, makes one think that this part of the story is invented. It looks that David had been told of such pre- coordination of testimonies, that he had not quite understood the matter, and relying on his "intelligence", was telling nonsense. C 23 and H 2, related item.)

e/ David's acclaimed broad knowledge of different "psychologi- cal" tricks on one side, and on the other side his unwittingly demonstrated lack of understanding of many basic principles of clandestine work, leave the impression that David has heard of most of those clever things after he had used his primitive knowledge during WW II, and is simply trying to impress us by telling "clever" stories. This would be in line with his need of showing up. ( G2; B7a, 16.)

f/ This could be true if he still is a "honest" crook, and the story is right in its main lines.
However, the too tight concentration of events, different infor- mation and alleged knowledge in this story, together with the unexcited, unpartial way of telling the exciting story by David, give also reason to think that the story is a "too good" cover- story of a penetration agent.

10. What could happen when David, being taken for a"honest crook", would be used in a clandestine operation?

a/ Due to his general instabilty and the trend to act under the effect of some cmentary thought, he might easily deviate of the pre-arranged, secure plan of action, and may fall into difficul- ties through his irrational steps.

b/ Due to the lack of solid, binding motivation, and the trend to use his own"cleverness", he may somehow" come to the splendid idea of contacting the "other side" and carry out the assignment


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

-39-

in his own, a better, perhaps less straining, easier way.
In his eyes this does not need to be urhonest, because the
boss knows that he is a crock, a honest, but clever one.

c/ If this analysis is right, then this hypothetical case of
"honest" David is mooving along the road of a wise mans work
which David likes to go: not too dangerous and straining phy-
sically, however, well exciting.

d/ If, however, David is a double agent, then he would not need
any of the found traits in his past activity, and his way to
the other side is simple, provided that he will not be detected
here before.

K. SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS.

To avaid possible errors, the following steps are suggested:

1.  A cross-check of all debriefing reports and other informa-
    tion available on David.

2.  Drafting a list of additional fact-finding and control ques-
    tions.

3.  Asking these questions under simultaneous application of
    consealed tape recording, thus providing an opportunity for
    detailed study of the answers and reactions of David.

4.  Secret checks on persons mentioned in David's story, espe-
    cially on Mathée Keresselidze.

5.  Secret checks with the French authorities on the last 10
    years of David's whereabouts, activities and contacts, in-
    cluding the time in jails.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

L. PERSONAL IMPRESSION
MADE BY DAVID ON THE DEBRIEFER.

1.  Soon after the second session of the debriefing,on 29 Apr, the debriefer was asked by the assigner whether the debriefer, if he were in the situation of an agent to go together with David on a clandestine operation, replied:

2.  NO, there is no rely on this man.
    This reply stands at this day of closing of this report!

a/ it is dangerous to go with him, even if warned that he is or might be a double-agent and when,thus,prepared for the resulting special dangers -
- he may add many more, unpredictable dangers by his irrational, flash-of-thought actions.

b/ it is still more dangerous to go with him if knowing his weaknesses, however taking him for a "honest" crook. No matter whether he be boss or subordinate, one can not rely on his adherence to the prepared plan and given orders.

c/ It is suicidal (unwittingly, of course) for a person who would be sent with him without being informed of his weaknesses, in full trust of his knowledges experience, rationality and all other necessary qualities which he does not have.

3.  Despite of this rather negative impression, it must be said that David could still prove to be a satisfactory performer, and an acceptable calculated risk on many one-man special operations, this especially in view of the rather general shortage of "excellent" stock of candidates.

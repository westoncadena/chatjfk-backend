AMBASSADOR FREEMAN ATTACKED BY SIEMPRE  FRIS No. 85, 30 Apr 64

Mexico City Correspondent's Dispatch in Spanish to PRENSA LATINA Havana 1910 ONT 23 April 1954-5 (FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY)

(Excorpt) Mexico City--In an article in the Mexico Cit magazine SIEMPRE on 23 April, Vistor Rico Galan writes that U.S. Ambassador Fulton Freeman made a statement to the press about Cuba and Brazil. "In a violet style that seems to come from the caverns of the John Pirch Society, he (criticized) the constitutional government of Joao Goulart and the Cuban Revolution: Ho talked like a soapbox orator, as if Issuing a polical proclaat.on,orottinq that Mexiou maintains frienal, relations with the Cuban Government and did have very close relatioaith the depored Braalllan President.. Mr. Freeman behaved like a savage guest who spits on his host country."

"This is no great cause for surprise. U.S. ambassadors are constantly Inter-fering in our domestic affairs as if it were the most natural thing. They feel as if they were on conquered ground, and not less like ambassadors than proconsuls who owe no consideration or explanation to anybody, as if this country belonged to them and they enjoyed boundless privileges.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

"14-00000"

"The surprising thing is that nobody has protested; the insult to Mexico has been passed over in absolute silence. Worse things will obviously come. No sooner does he arrive in Mexico than Mr. Freeman arrogates the right to shout anything he pleases, because Washington has become impatient with Mexico's independent policy, a.k. the Texan style of the Johnson-Mann team (is?) alien to the relative tolerance of the Kennedy 'Intellectuals'. Freeman comes to exert pressure violently and announces at the start that he is ready for anything. It is the policy of international gangsterism that requires the conduct of a bully in those who pursue it."

Further on, the writer says: "Either these saloon ruf.ians are stopped short or nobody will be able to stand them. That is why it is serious that nobody has raised his voice to teach Freeman some manners, and that, on the contrary, General Olachoa, secretary of de defense, should have paid him honors with all his general staff without daring to point out to him that this is an independent country and that proconsuls and viceroys are not allowed here."

"Every U.S. ambassador who comes to Mexico makes his predecessor look good by comparison, but at least in the beginning all try to make themselves liked. But not Fulton Freeman. He comes with sullen looks, raising his voice so nobody can be mistaken. He shows his hand right at the start and announces that he is not going to try to convince anybody but will give orders. This indicates quite clearly that the State Department thinks it has been too patient and feels o.rcumstances are ripe for acting tough and violently."

## Nuovo Sirviente Oficial:
Rico, Galán y con Librea

![logo of Siempre!]

El sefior Victor Rico Galán, escritor de "Siempre", trata de comprar su libertad haciendo de sirviente cinico al gobierno ya su revista *mater et magister del confusiontamo*”. Bueno que este “martir” trate de salir y que atiborre a quien lo lea de la bazofia trotskista; bueno que utilice la comprobada via de escritor de “Siempre” para labrar-se su salida; bueno que acuse a los remotos Imperialismos ya grupos Innominados de todas las culpas, escondiendo así la muy presente culpa del gobierno y de la clase dominante mexicana. Bueno para sus muy mezquinos y pequeñitos “objetivos”, pues sus desahogos palabreros nada tienen qué ver con la lucha re-

Desde la crulla “N”, Rico Gu-in habla-mantenido un silencio meticuloso, hasta que llego el momento de “hacer cualquier servicio al enemigo” con tat de salir; hasta que llegó el momen-to de encontrar el camino de volver a escribir en “Siempre” para labrarse su excareciación, como ya lo hicieron otros antes de él; hasta que llegó el nia-mento de olvidarse de las pille-Mas del dirvetor de “Siempre quien, cuando al gobierno con-vina, le dio un ramania en volini

Independientemente de que siga usted encontrando elementales razones humanas o se le hayan agotado las que exbló, esta carta tiene Importancia para mi dignidad personal y por ello esperare a que la publique hasta el jueves, pero reservándome copla y el derecho de hacerla pública por otrus niodios en caso necesario. - Atentamente, Victor Rico Galan".

Eso fue ayer, pero hoy ya todo cambió: la mala conciencia del "jefe Pages" se volvió buena; el héroe que rechazaba la "Ilmosna" pagesina, se vuelve limosnero; quien ser nego a escribir en "Siempre" por clementales razones de dignidad, se ha vuelto Indigno. Ese es el camino que enseña el colaborador de "Siempre":

Insulta a Genaro Vázquez desde "Siempre", ¡vaya dignidad!

Escupir rabioso sobre Debray, sobre los guerrilleros brasileños; mentir, desapareciéndolos del mundo de los vivos, es obra de sucios plumíferos, cuando se usa la tribunita confusionista de "Siempre".

Bien Informado esta el maniqui del "Jefe Pages". No sólo sabe lo que les ha pasado a todos en Brasil: no colo califica de "Idiota historico" a Debray, reci

amo que puede afirmar que el responsable del asesinato de Pablo Alvarado B., no es "eu" general Arcaute, sino que hay más por alli que difaman les culpas.

Pero podemos, los que día a día luchamos por sacar esta revista, exigir a este pobre Galán y a sus amos de "Slempre" y a los ainos de ambos, a los gobernantes de México y a la clase dominante que los sostiene, lanzales una exigencia clara y terminante:

Ustedes, blen Informados pollzontes, blen informados, criados con o sin librea, prueben consus elementos que la Revista POR QUE? esta. Onanciada por la CIA o por Instrumentos de la CIA. Demuestren, señores gobernantes de México, servil instrumento de todos los gobernantes en turno, "Jefe Pages". Demuestren lo que afirma Rico Galán por ordenes de ustedes.

Esperamos sus "pruebas", y nos reimos de la pobre mentalidad de todos ustedes al asignar a nuestra Revista apoyos que ustedes mismos distorsionan, por lo que ha dolido a sus patrones gubernamentales la denuncia presentada por diversos periodistas en todos los instrumentes de las Naciones Unidas y en tonales de periodistas. Ahora, das las asociaciones internecionales de periodistas. Ahora, prueben su dicho e queden alli como calumuladores. Y ojald que pronto liberen a su sirviente los señores que gobiernan a México, para que el "heroe" pueda volver a su basurero.

chosa en Guerrero, por lo que no se puede creer a Castrejón que lo trajeron a salto de mata, siguiendo el pazo de los guerrilleros. ¡Vaya lógica ignara!

Y como traja al extinto Pablo Alvarado Barrera?, asl con el nombre escurto, ya que muchas veces lanzó en contra del y extinto su venencen baba de caIninatador, acusandolo de agendes CLA Lo unies grato que dice de Pablo es llamario "rehen", para más adelante, en el penultimo parrafo de su "arthailo", citarlo indirectamente y llamarle uno de esos "desesperados, aventureros, terroristas que se mueren...". Pero ya el revolucionario Pablo Alvarado Barrera no puede responderie, como tamipoco ta puede hacerlo directamente Mario R. Menendez

    Ermistina Larrauizar # 17-8, Colonia del Valle, Mexico City

8.  POLITICAL AFFILIATION:
    Subject has been a well known leftist journalist in Mexico since at least 1957. Since at least 1960 he has been a steady writer for the two leftist periodicals *Siempre* and *Politica*. Subject was a founding member of the MIN and subsequently headed that group's Press and Propaganda Committee. He has always been close and sympathetic to the CASTRO revolution and, in 1961, was reported to be a member of "Periodiotes Nextcenos Amigos do Cuba" and of the "Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution". As of June 1965, Subject was reported to be a member of the FEP and an enemy of the FPS.

9.  SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES:
    Subject was arrested in Aug, 63 for participating in a pro-political prisoner demonstration. Subject's pro-CASTRO/Communist writings as well as his contacts with known Soviet, Satellite and Cuban intelligence personnel in Mexico during the past few years leave no doubt as to his "propaganda role, under journalistic cover, on behalf of these interests. Subject visited Cuba during Kay-Juno 63 ostensibly to interview CASTRO after latter's return from the Soviet Union. During this contact with the Cuban government, however, he was given the mission of traveling through Central & South America to contact local Communist/guerrilla leaders for the purpose of persuading them to begin campaigns of violence and terror to take the pressure off the FAIN in Venezuela. A secondary mission was to bring about greater unity among the various Communist and terrorist groups. Subject undertook this assignment during Oct. - Dec 63, visited Caribbean and South American countries, and contacted key Communists in each. Subject visited the Dominican Republic in Jan 64, and as a result of the contacts made there with the AFCJ (militant, revolutionary, pro-CASTRO group) was able to serve during the Dominican crisis of May 65 as a relay point for material and instructions from Cuba to the AFCJ and also as a reporting channel from Juan F. MENIA, an AFCJ lender, to the Cuban Intelligence Service and the AFCJ's CASTRO-Cuban leadership in Cuba. Subject returned to Mexico from a trip to Cuba on 11 Tecra 6.

## Summary

1.  Victor RICO Galan is a prominent pro-Castro Marxist journal-ist associated with *Politica* a pro-Communist bi-weekly news magazine and *Siempre* a Mexico City Toftist news wockly. In 1961 he wan reported to be a member of the Periodistas Mexicanos Amigos de Cuba and the Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Rovolution. As of June 1965 he was reported to be a mombor of the Fronte Electoral del Pueblo (FEP). He was a founder of the Movimiento de Liboracion Nacional (MLN) of which he was the head of the hational press and propaganda committee as of 1962. RICO acted as a Cuban agent in trips to Central and South America in late 1963 and early 1964. His pro-Castro communist writings as well as his contacts with known Soviet and Bloc intelligence personnel in Mexico during the past fow years strongly suggest a propaganda role under journalistic cover on behalf of their interests.

2.  Little is known of RICO's oarly life or oducation beyond what is listed in his basic biographic data. There is a possibility that he was active in communist affairs in Costa Rica and El Salvador in the period 1946-1948 and in Colombia in 1949-1950.

3.  RICO Galan's prominence in Mexican loftist circles has been primarily intellectual. In an article in *Siempre* in March 1963 ho advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the truo ideology of Lazaro CARDENAS. RICO felt that this would provide the Mexican loft with a political party truly responsive to the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This was necessary, in RICO's view, because the MLN was an action organization rather than a political party, whose mombership covered a political spectrum from the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) to the Partido Comunista de Mexico (PCM), and was therefore diluted in effectiveness. A now party would reprosont a "third position": Socialism in internal affairs and independence of any bloc in international affairs, With such a political action arm, wrote RICO, the iLN would dovolop naturally into a broad national movement such as the FRAP in Chilo.

4.  Victor RICO Galan is an ardent supporter of Fidel CASTRO and is reported to be a close friend of his. In order to gather material for a biography of CASTRO, RICO, later joined by his wife, visited Cuba in October 1962 for about two months. He visited Cuba again during part of May and most of June 1963 when he spent eight days with CASTRO, five of them at sea in CASTRO's boat, ostensibly to discus CASTRO's recont trip to the Soviet Union and his talks with KHRUSCHEV. On this visit the Cuban Government gave RICO a mission to travel through Contral and South America to contact local communists and guerrilla leaders and persuade then to begin immediately campaigns of violence and terror in order to take the pressure off the FALN in Venezuola. RICO was also charged to try to bring about greater unity among the various leftist groups.

5. In the Fall and Winter of 1963 and late 1964 undertook this mission. Even though a known leftist he possibly had some arrangement with the Mexican Government which may have gotten him special privi- logos and support from Mexican embassies in countries whore ho visited. In Guatemala RICO interviewed Gonoral Enrique PERALTA Azurdia the Chief of Government and then met Raul ALARCON Monsanto, military training leader of the Partido Guatemalteco de Trabajo (PGT), who took him to meet and interview Marco Antonio YON Sosa an anti regime guerrilla leader; RICO possibly also met a (fnu) GOMEZ Ayau also a guorrilla leader. In Nicaragua ho mot with Alvaca RAMIREZ Gonzalos, Socretary Gonoral of the Mobilizacion Republicana (MR) and a member of the Contral Committee of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN). In Costa Rica ho mot with one of the MORA brothers, a guerrilla leader. In Panama ho mot Hugo VICTOR, prosident of the Partido del Pueblo (PDP), and David TURNER, loader of the Vanguard of National Action (VAN), and attempted to reconcile them in their dispute for leadership of the rovolution in Panama; ho also urged an immediate program of sabotage and violonco. RICO wont on to Venezuela to meet Argelia LAYA; he was probably in contact with the MIR while there. He then wont to Brazil where he contacted Paulo SCHILLING, coordinator of the Popular Mobi- lization Front. During this time he may have gone to Cuba briefly and returned directly to Brazil. After a fow days back in Mexico RICO went to the Dominican Republic whore ho attempted unsuccessfully to obtain photographs of Dominican guerrillas killed the month before, probably to uso them for propaganda purposes. As a result of his contact with the Agrupacion Politica Catorce Junio (APCJ) in the Dominican Republic ho was able to servo during the Dominican Republic crisis of May 1965 as a relay point for material and instructions from Cuba to the APCJ and also as a reporting channel from Juan B. MEJIA and APCJ leaders to the Cuban Intelligence Service and the APCJ'S CASTRO Cuban leadership in Cuba. After his return to Mexico City RICO visited Cuba again ostensibly to interview CASTRO on his most recent trip to the Soviet Union and probably to report on his mission.

6. RICO Galan continued his interest in the guerrilla struggle and was reported to have entered Guatemala clandestinoly in August 1964 and possibly several times before then as well, to visit YON Sosa and his guerrillas. In March 1966, after having returned from Cuba the month before, he planned to travel again to Guatemala clandestinely in order to investigate the disappearance of Victor Manuel GUTIERREZ, leader of the PGT and of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico, who had recently returned to Guatemala.

7. RICO's writings show an ardent support for the guerrillas in Latin America and for their method in achieving the revolution. In October 1964 the Guatemalan Armed Forcos captured a number of tape recorders and tapes from the guerrillas including one by

Victor RICO Galan. This tapo consisted mainly of an oxhortation for unity botween the PGT and the 13 November Group, and counsolod against letting doctrine roplace action. RICO's talk to the guerrillas undor YON Bosa rovoals him as an intellectual radical with a pragmatio approach towards current situations. The text of the tapes indicate that they were made between February and mid-October 1964. On 13 January 1966 El Moraldo, a Mexico City newspapor published an article quoting RICO Calan's tapod spooch as ovidonce of his his offorts to undermine the January 1966 visit of DIAZ Ordaz to Guatemala. The text of the tape was possibly passed to El Heraldo by the Mexican authorities in line with the Government's campaign to neutralize all potential and existing opposition to the impending visit.

excrcice of effective economic sovereignty, implies many things, such
as trade with the socialist world--which next year will represent 52%

Embassy had ceverely chided Rico for writing an article favorable to
the guerrilla leaders who were killed recently during their assault
on the army barrocks at Madera, Chihuahua.... Rico had been close to
"Che" Guevarra rather than Castro, and that since Guevarra's disap-

do nothing to help them. "According to Carlos Sanchez Cardenas of the
PPS National Executive Directorate, it is almost impossible to believe
that a man like Rico could be the leader of an armed rebel movement.
He has always been considered a Marxist intellectual belonging to no

Incapable of doing anything that involved a mass following."

1. In reviewing Subject's file the Station has come across a surprisingly large number of reference to Guatemala, which are pulled together below. Please note, however, that some of the Guatemalan ties given below are hypothetical and that the Guatemalan side of the picture has been particularly stressed for the purposes of this dispatch.

2. Lorenzo CARDENAS Barajas (P-3409). In April-May 1962 a Guatemalan Communist source was dealing with CARDENAS in procuring arms for Guatemala, and CARDENAS told the source that he had a great friend in the Soviet Embassy who was aware of CARDENAS' arms procurement activities (Source: LINLUCK). On 19 April 1963 Subject was observed holding a half-hour meeting in a restaurant under obviously clandestine circumstances with CARDENAS (Source: LIEMBRACE). On 31 May 1963 the Station placed an article in a Mexico City newspaper stating that Subject was working with CARDENAS on smuggling arms to Central American countries. On 21 February 1967 Subject's car was seen passing slowly by CARDENAS, who was standing on a street corner with a friend; Subject's wife was driving the car (Source: LIEMBRACE). On 30 March 1967 Subject, with his wife as passenger, drove twice within a few minutes past CARDENAS, who was sitting at an outdoor cafe with two friends (Source: LIEMBRACE).

3. Ricardo MIRANDA Aldana (201-7873092), Guatemalan Communist who received guerrilla training in Cuba February - October 1962. MIRANDA bas said that he was in contact with Subject when he was in Mexico in January - February 1962 on bio vay to Cuba. MIRANDA also said that he had net Subject before when Bubject was with Anastas MIKOYAN in Cuba (in February 1960). MIRANDA has said that Subject has been a close friend of Guatemalan Communist leader Pernardo LEHUS Mendoza (P-5023, 201-091575) since 1953 (when Subject first cane to Mexico). (Source: captured documents). On 7 Déconber 1966 a "friend from Guatemala" called Subject's office, saying that be already knew Subject but that Subject did not know that he was in Mexico and that he did not want to go to Subject's office or use the telephone. He was told to call back the next day. The next day "MIRANDA" (probably Ricardo MIRANDA Aldana) called Subject's office, and Subject asked his to come to his bouse (same as office) the following day at 1000 hours. (Source: LIFEAT).

4. Lilian JIMENEZ Consuegra de LEIVA (P-5169, 201-228386), Balvadoran Communist employed at the Imprenta Madero to proof-read the Soviet Information Bulletin and paid by the Soviet Press Offico. 8bo 18 oirried to aul LRIVA Munoz, a Guatemalan Communist writer, Lilian has been occasionally reported asking for an appointment with Subject in order to discuss unspecified matters, For example, on 22 September 1967 she said she had an urgent natter to discuon with Subject, and Subject agroed to see her at her house at 0900 house at 0900 hours on Monday, 25 September (Bource: LIPPAT).

5. Sose Maria ALVAREZ Posada (P-4415) is a Spanish Communist employed by the Soviet Press Office as an editor for their Bulletin. He seems to be very active apong Spanish Communists in Mexico and also frequently sets up meetings bo-tween Bubject and Juan REJANO Porras (P-1027, 201-109935). The latter is one of the leaders of the Spanish Communist Party in Mexico but also has close ties to other Communist groupas particularly the Cubans and Czechs as well as tho Mexicans, and on at least one occasion he was seen going to the Cuban Embassy with one of the leaders of the Guatemalan Communist Party in Mexico. REJANO 18 in in almost daily contact with ALVAREZ Posada, often says that he needs to goo Subject urgently, has several times anked about scholarships to the USSR for unidentified persons. on 21 July 1967 it was reported hat Subject had given ALVAREZ Posada a letter that was to be returned to REJANO, but often Subject arranges to see REJANO personally at the latter's house. (Source: LIFEAT).

6. In view of ALVAREZ Posada's apparent acting as a cut-out for Subject, as described above, the folioving item may aleo be connected with Subject. On 29 June 1967" "Max" told ALVAREZ Posada that there was a letter "there" from Guatemala that had been there since 22 June but "Max" had not been able to reach ALVAREZ Posada before. ALVAREZ Posada said he would be home after 1600 hours (so that "Hax" could bring him the letter). (Source: LIFEAT). Although it is pure guesspork, the Station suggests that "Hax" might be Maximiliano SALAZAR Garcia (201-183293), a Guatemalan Communist living in Mexico. SALAZAR has been very quiet recently, but on 14 July 1965 ha was reported in contact with Carlos ILLESCAS Aguirre (cf. bolow) about finding housing and a job for an unidentified boy, and it is entirely possible that he continues to be active behiud the scones in Guatemalan exile affaira.

7. Since June 1965 until as recently as March 1967 Subject has been reported receiving telephone calls from a "Carlos" with a non-Hexican accent. Normally Subject and "Carlos" simply agree to meet, without naning the place. Nice "Sonor Jacobo" has been mentioned in an unclear context during their conversations. (Scurce: LIFEAT). Although "Carlos" as a name is not much of a lead, the Station "suggests that he might be identical with Carlos ILLESCAB Aguirre (Hernandez) (P-1901, 201-764855), Guatemalan Communist living in Mexico. Although ILLESCAS has been very quiet sinca 1964, when the Mexican authorities clamped down on hin, he is known to have been used by the Soviets in the past and probably still worke with them. la 1953, when ILLESCAS van still working at the Quatonalan Embassy in Mexico, he reportedly was very active as a courier for the Soviets (Source: LINLUCK). In 1959 ILLESCAS VAS reported in contact with Nikolay Vasilyovich' Assistant, Soviet_Cultural Attachea job later taken over by Subject (Source: LIFEAT). In 1961-62 ILLESCAS was reported to be still in contact_vith the Soviets in regard to guerrilla plane for Guatemala (Source: LINLUCK). On 23 August 1967 i was reported that ILLESCAS passed 22,000 Mexican pesos to one of the Guatemalan Communist leaders in Mexico. This money van described as a monthly subsidy from either the Cubans or the Soviets intended to help the Guatemalan Communists in jail in Mexico.(Source: LIREBEL-2). The above references to "Senor Jacobo" might possibly have meant Jacobo ARBENZ Guzman, former president of Guatemala; unfortunately the tapes of the conver- sations have been erased and the exact context in which this name was mentioned can no longer be reconstructed...

8. Hava (Eva) (P-11484), wife of Guatemalan Communist Sergio de la PENA, was reported to bave met Subject in May 1965. On 29 May 1965 Subject invited Hava to dinner, apparently at the. suggestion of Enrique SEMO Calev, Kexican Communist leader. Subject told Hava that he was interested in her contacts with other embassies and particularly asked her to put him in touch with Americans. Hava vas subsequently reported having Subject and his wife to dinner on several occasions. (Source: LIFEAT). (It seems obvious that-Subject was fishing for leads through/ Hava; however, Hava's Guatemalan contacts may well have been of no interest to Subject.)

9. Victor RICO Galan (P-7354, 201-336474), Spanish-bora Mexican Communist journalist, agent of Cuban government known to have been sent by the Cubans to talk to Guatemalan guer- rillas in 1963, la prison since August 1966 for subversive activities allegedly directed against the Mexican government was in frequent contact with Subject in 1965-66. They usually simply arranged to see each other to discuss undisclosed matters, and Subject apparently called RICO from a pay phone rather than from his office. (Source: LIFEAT) (Subject has.. apparently provided RICO with propaganda for news articles, but they appear to have had other common interests as well; one of which could well have been RICO's guerrilla activities.)

SUBJECT: JMROD Operational/Transmittal of Letter for Rico Galan

ACTION REQUIRED: None; FYI

REFERENCE: HMMW-15207, dated 30 January 1967

Upon receipt of the letter sent via the reference above, the Mexico City Station officers concerned discussed the best method of delivering the letter to Rico Galan so the operation would appear natural and also to be sure the letter would be received by him. It was decided, finally, to have LIRICE-11 deliver the letter to Rico's wife with a short explanation of its background. Two weeks were spent in trying to locate Inge de Galan and the efforts were fruitless. The Station then decided to have LIRICE-11 deliver the letter to Elena Garro an old friend of Rico's. LIRICE-11 tried for a week and one half to find her at home with negative results. The Station then instructed him to leave the letter at her home with a request that it be passed to Rico. Attached is a copy of the covering letter LIRICE-11 left for Garro.

SUBJECT VICTOR RICO GALAN'S VIEWS ON THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN LATIN AMERICA AND ON FIDEL CASTRO

ACQ 31 JANUARY 1967

FIELD NO.

SOURCE LEFTIST JOURNALIST WHO TALKED WITH VICTOR RICO GALAN IN THE LECUMBERRI PENITENTIARY IN MEXICO CITY. SOURCE IS A RELIABLE REPORTER.

1. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: VICTOR RICO GALAN, PRO-CUBAN JOURNALIST, WAS ARRESTED ON 12 AUGUST 1966, TOGETHER WITH SOME FORTY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRP). RICO GALAN WAS CHARGED WITH REBELLION, CONSPIRACY, AND ACCUMULATION OF ARMS. UNDER THESE CHARGES, HE IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR BAIL.)

2. RICO GALAN BELIEVES THAT VIOLENT REVOLUTION THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA IS "INDISPENSABLE," SINCE THE PEACEFUL ROAD TO CHANGE IS BLOCKED EVERYWHERE. REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS ARE ON THE RISE EVERYWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA, ACCORDING TO RICO GALAN. IN HIS OPINION, THESE MOVEMENTS ARE MARXIST, WITH LIBERAL TENDENCIES, AND ARE NOT AS RIGID AS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY LINE. RICO GALAN STATED THAT CASTRO HAS THE DOMINANT INFLUENCE WITHIN THEM.

REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS IN VZIZZUZIA, GUATEMALA, COLOMBIA, AID ALL OF CAMPAI AMERICA. THE SOVIETS HAVZ DOMINANT INFLUENCE IN CHILE, AKIZITINA, AND MEXICO. IN MEXICO, HOWEVER, CASTRO AND KOECON SEE EYE TO EYE, ACCORDING TO RICO らんん!!, AND HAVE PARALLEL POLICIZS; BUT THE SOVIET UNION IS THE PRIMARY POWER POMOTING THESE POLICIES.

3. GUATEMALA AID VZICZUZIA ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE REVOLUTIONA MOVEMENTS ARE THE MOST ADVANCED, IN FICO GALAN'S OPINION, HE HAD THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS TO MAKE ON ΤΗΣ SITUATION IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES

A. GUATEMALA. IN GUATEMALA, UNLIKE VENEZUELA, THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAD NOT INITIATED ΤΗΣ ΑRMED STRUGGLE. THE TWO GROUPS INVOLVED IN THE ARMED STRIGLE WERE THE 13 NOVEMBER GROUP LED BY MARCO ANTONIO YON GOSA AND THE REBEL AFMED FORCE (FAR) LED DI CESAP MONTES, SINCE THE DEATH OF LUIS AUGUSTO TURCICE. THE 13 NOVEMBER GROUP HAS TROPSCOTE INFLUJENCE, WHILE THE FAR 18 "CASTIJELA DE WITH THES TO THE GUATEMALAN COMUNIST PARTY (997). NINERY PERCENT OF THE YEOPLE ARE PEASANTS, AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM SYMPATHIZE WITA AND SUPPORΣ ΤΗΣ ΑΡΜED STRUCGLE.

B. VENEZUELA. POTE THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEPT (MIR) LAUNCHED THE AFMED STRUGGLE, BUT POTH HAVE NOW ABANDONED IT, BOTH MOVEMENTS CONFINED THEIR EFFORTS MOSTLY TO THE CITIES AND ENGAGED MOSTLY IN TERRORIST ACTS. THESE

TACTICS DID NOT PROMOTE THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE AT AIL.
THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOW DIRECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF
NATIONAL LIPERATION (FALN) LED BY DOUGIAS BRAVO AND WILL
NOW SUCCEED. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: RICO GALAN IS ECHOING
THE LIFE OF DOUGLAS BRAVO, LEADER OF THE DISSIDENT FALN, IN
ACCUSING THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VENEZUELA (PCV) AND THE MIR
OF ABANDONING THE "ARMED STRUGGLE." BOTH THE TCV AND THE MIR
HAVE HAD, AND CONTINUE TO HAVE, RURAL GUERRILLA FORCES AS WELL
AS URBAN TERRORIST UNITS. ALTHOUCH A SOFT-LINE FACTION OF THE
MIR RENOUNCED VIOLENCE EARLY IN 1964, THE MORE MILITAI WING
CONTINUED THIS POLICY, AFTER FIRST OLETING THE SOUT-LINERS.)

RICO GALAN DESCRIED MEXICO AS AN APPARENT DEMOCRACY BUS A "POLICE STATE,
TIGHTLY HELD." HE RELIEVED THAT POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN MEXICO AND ELGOWlions Ill
LATIN AMERICA WERE ON THE RISE. SINCE THERE WERE NO LEADERS LIKE CASTRO AROUND,
RICO CALAN BELIEVED THAT THE LEADERS OF THESE POPULAR MOVEMENTS WOULD COME FROM THE
WRITERS, THE INTELLECTUALS, AND THE LAWYERS.

5. REGARDING FIDEL CASTRO, RICO CALAN SAYS THAT NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER CASTRO IS
   A COMMUNIST OR WHAT KIND OF COMMUNIST HE MIGHT BE. HE IS A GREAT REVOLUTIONARY
   LEADER AND A GREAT TACTICIAN, BUT HE CANNOT PLAY THE ROLE OF LIBERATOR OF LATIN
   AMERICA FOR HE IS TOO DEFENDENT ON THE SOVIET UNION AND THE SOVIET UNION CONTROLS
   HIM TIGHTLY. REGARDING CUBA-SOVIET CONFLICTS, RICO GALAN SAID THEY WERE MORE APPAREN

Egregio Dottore:

Sono 11 pubblicista italiano Luigi Do Marchi che ebbe l'onore di una breve intervista con Lei il 13 gennaio u.s. Ho cercato, finora senza successo, di riunirmi con Lei di nuovo per continuare la nostra conversazione. Mi auguro la presente la trovi in buona salute. La affido ad un amico "do confianza" che si incarichera di fargliela pervenire.

Sono tuttora in viaggio e faro tutto il possibile rivederla presto. Nel frattempo gradirei moltissimo, Lei consenziente, avere una sua critica sul libro che le lasciai, UTILES DESPUES MUERTOS, per una eventuale pubblicazione sul periodico romano *Corrispondenza Socialista.* Resta inteso che Le rimetteremo prontamente l'onorario stabilito.

Con i miei piu distinti saluti,

Dear Sir:

I am the Italian journalist Luigi De Marchi who had the honor of a brief interview with you on the 13th of January. I have tried, up to now without success, to get together with you again to continue our conversation. I trust that this letter finds you in good health. I am entrusting it to a friend "de confianza" who will try to see to it that it reaches you.

I am still traveling and I'll do everything possible to see you again soon. Meanwhile I would be very pleased if you would agree to write a review of the book I left with you, *UTILES DESPUES MUERTOS*, for eventual publication in the Roman periodical, *CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA*. Rest assured that you would be paid promptly the usual fee.

with best regards,

Luigi De Marchi

SLCRET

13 January 1967

SUBJECT: Meeting with Victor RICO Galan

1.  The writer had about a one-hour meeting with Victor
    RICO Galan at the Lecumberri penitentiary on 13 January 1967.
    The meeting was held at the central reception room with
    several armed guards present; my civilian escort also
    remaIned in the general area, and there were also some other
    civilians present from time to time (I think walting to see
    other prisoners)

2.  RICO Galan arrived at the meeting area at about the
    some time as I old. After an exchange of greetings and a
    warm handshake, I I gave RICO Galan my letter of Introduction
    (a copy is attached). He read It carefully and then told
    me how glad he was to see me. He Inquired about his friend:
    Carlo Coccioll, I replied simply that I had seen him in Rome
    before he left for Parls and he was fine. (At the end of
    the meeting, RICO Galan asked me to convey his greetings to
    Coccioll when I returned to Italy, and of course I sald I
    would.) I also explained to RICO Galan that I had a bottle
    of whiskey for him, but the guards bad refused to let me
    bring it in. I think he appreciated the thought.

3.  Because of my connection with Coccioli, a pro-
    Communist journalist and a friend of RICO Galen in Mexico
    for several years, plus the name of my periodical,
    *Corrispondenza Socialista*, RICO Galan apparently assumed that
    I was (and accepted me as) a fellow Marxist. He expressed
    himself spontaneously and I belleve he revealed his true
    thoughts during the discussion and in answer to questions.
    A friendly rapport was immediately established between us.

4. I explained at the outset that I was on a tour of
   Latin America to study conditions and revolutionary movements.
   If he were agreeable, I said I also wished to write a plece
   on him for *Corrispondenza Socialista*. RICO Galen was very
   agreeable. I also said that if he wished to write an article
   for my periodical, we would pay him. He also found this Idea
   agreeable, but qualified his approval by saying he first
   wanted to take a look at the periodical to see its "line"
   and format.

5.  Hy first substantive question was how he viewed the
    revolutionary situation in Latin America. I asked whether
    he thought "violent revolution" a necessary stage in the
    development of Latin America. He answered quickly and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

-2-

emphatically that "violent revolution" throughout Latin
America was "Indispensable" because the peaceful road to
necessary change was "blocked everywhere". He saw
revolut lonary movements on the rise everywhere in Latin
America. I asked for the Ideological nature and affillations
of these revolutionary movements. He replied that they are
Marxist, but with liberal tendencies, not as rigid as the
International communist revolutionary line.

6. I asked in which countries the revolutionary move-
   ments were most advanced. He named Guatemala and Venezuela
   In a category by themselves, there the revolutions were
   certain to win power. Then he gave me a general briefing
   on these two countries.

a. Guatemala: in Guatemala, unlike Venezuela,
the Communist Party had not Initiated the armed struggle
The two groups Involved in the armed struggle were the
"13 November" group led by Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, and the
"Fuerza Armada Rebelde (FAR)", led by Cesar Montes, now that
Luis Augusto Turcios is dead. The "13 November" group, he
said, had Trotskylte influences, while the "FAR" was
"Castrista/Independent", and with thes to the Guatemalan
CP but also having differences with the CP. He said 90%
of the people in Guatemala are peasants and the majority
sympathize and support the armed struggle

b. Venezuela: Both the CP and the MIR launched
the armed struggle, but they have now abandoned it. I
asked why. He said both movements confined their efforts
mostly to the cities and took the form of terroristic acts,
These tactics did not get the revolution anywhere. Now the
Frente de Liberacion Nacional (FLN) led by Douglas Bravo
was directing the armed struggle, and this effort will succeed.

RICO Gelan asked me to read a recent article on Venezuela
by Marlo Menenckiz Rodriguez, Director of Sucesos, who had
recently been to Venezuela and had interviewed the FLN leaders.
In answer to my question, RICO Galan described Menendez as a
"perlodista Castrolsta".

7. RICO Galan described Mexico as an apparent
   democracy but "police state, tightly held". Here the
   "popular movements" are on the rise. In answer to my
   question as to who was leading these "popular" and
   revolutionary movements in Mexico and Latin America, RICO
   Galan replied that there were no leaders Ilke Castro around,
   and the leaders would come from the writers, intellectuals
   and lawyers.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

8. I asked RICO Galan for his appraisal and total
   evaluation of Fidel Castro Ruz. He said, first of all, if
   Cestro is a Communist or what kind of a Communist he is,
   nobody knows. He is a great revolutionary leader and a great
   tactician, but he can not play the role of liberator of Latin
   America for he is too dependent upon Russia and Russia
   controls him tightly. I think RICO Galan meant to Imply that
   Castro has become a tool of the Soviets. He sald, Ernesto
   "Che" Guevara really wanted Cuba to break away from the
   Sovlet chains, but Castro Is not able to do this. As to the
   whereabouts of "Che", RICO Galan sald that perhaps not even
   Fidel Castro knows where he is.

9. Regarding Cubari-Soviet conflicts, RICO Galan said
   they are more apparent than real. Then I asked him to name
   countries of primary Cuban or Soviet Influence. He said
   Castro has dominant influence within the revolutionary move-
   ments In Vonezuela, Guatemala, all of Central America, and
   Colombla. The Soviets have dominant Influence In Chile,
   Argentina and Mexico. However, he added, in Mexico, Castro
   and Moscow see "eye to eye" and have parallel policies, but
   the primary power to push these policies is Russia.

10. RICO Galan sald Communist Chinese influence in Latin
    America Is negligible.

11. After about an hour, our meeting ended abruptly for
    a guard from the office of the prison director came to get
    RICO Galon, his lawyer was there to see him. I held him
    back for an extra minute and then we parted, reluctantly,
    with a worm handshake.

12. The foregoing clearly reveals RICO Galan to be an
    unrepentant, fervent revolutionary. He believes, on the
    basis of what he sald, that he is associated with a winning
    cause. He was in high spirits and looked fine.

13. I returned to the Lecumberri Penitentiary at about
    5:15 P.M. the same afternoon for another session with RICO
    Galan. The main door entrance was closed. I knocked and a
    guard opened a little window. I asked to see the Director,
    but the guard sald he was not there. I explained who I was
    and what I wanted, when he heard the name of RICO Galan, the
    guard said it was Impossible to see him and closed the window.
    A montant later 1: knocked again. I asked the guard if he would
    deliver a massage to RICO Galan from me. He sald that also
    was Impossible, only the Director could do that. The guard
    certainly did his duty.

1.- El que suscribe notifica que durante el mes tuve un intercambio de ideas en el local de su sindicato con el Jefe de la DINA, con su ayudante y varios otros civiles presentes y creo que es necesario ver a algunos prisioneros.

2.- Vino DINA y yo llegamos simultáneamente al lugar de la entrevista. Hubo un intercambio de saludos y una explicación de quiénes éramos. Le entregué o hizo la presentación, una copia de la cual adjunto. Al leerlo cuidadosamente y entonces comentó que le daba gusto conocerme. Inquirió sobre si lo reconocía y que me decía de él. Le respondí que lo vi en Roma antes de su salida hacia Torino y que se encontraba bien. Al terminar nuestra reunión, dijo a C que yo lo esperara. También le prometí que así lo haría. Yo entiendo cuando yo regreso porque los sometidos no le permitieron enterarse de este acto.

3.- hablé con C.I, que es periodista pro-comunista y amigo de dos o tres chicos, dándome información de mi verificación. Después informó completamente esto que yo soy un comunista y se contó como tal. Ha expresado en forma confusa y creo que reveló sus pensamientos verdaderos durante nuestra discusión y al responder a mis preguntas. Inmediatamente se estableció entre nosotros una corriente intocable.

4.- Yo en realidad puedo asegurar que estaba hablando con una iluminación y los problemas eran lo que él podía ver.

Inmediatamente después decidió escribir un artículo para el periódico. Le esperaba la DINA, pero antes me dijo que quería ver un ejemplar del periódico para crear en línea y formato.

5.- El primero de los puntos importantes fue nuestra situación revolucionaria en Italia. En mi opinión el desarrollo de Italia. Respondió que la situación violenta es indispensable en toda


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

América Latina debido a que la via pacífica a todo calió necesario, caté bloquendo. Tralto el cumplimiento de movimientos revolucionarios en toda la América Latina. Le pregunté sobre la naturaleza ideológica y afiliaciones de estos movimientos revolucionarios. In respondió que son marxistas, pero con tendencias liberales, no con la rigidez de la línea revolucionaria comunista internacional.

6.- Le preguntó que en cuáles países están más avanzados los movimientos revolucionarios. Nombró en primer término a Guatemala y Venezuela, ya que allí las revoluciones ciertamente se harán del poder. Luego me hizo un resumen general de esos dos países.

a.- Guatemala: en Guatemala, a diferencia de Venezuela, el Partido Comunista no inició la lucha armada. Los dos grupos involucrados en el levantamiento, fueron el grupo "13 de Noviembre" dirigido por MARCO ANTONIO YON SOSA, y la "Fuerza Armada Rebelde", dirigida por CESAR MONTES, ahora que LUIS AUGUSTO TURCIOS está muerto. El grupo 13 de noviembre, según dijo, tenía influencia trotskista mientras que el F.I.R. era castrista independiente pero con ligas al Partido Comunista Guatemalteco, a la vez que teniendo diferencias con el mismo. Dijo que el noventa por ciento de la población de Guatemala, son campesinos y que la mayoría simpatiza y apoya la lucha armada.

b.- Venezuela: Tanto el Partido Comunista como el MIR iniciaron la lucha armada, pero ahora la han abandonado. Preguntó la razón. RICO GALAN! respondió que ambos movimientos confinaron sus esfuerzos principalmente a las ciudades y tomaron la forma de actos terroristas. Estas tácticas, no llevaron la revolución a meta alguna, que ahora el Frente de Liberación Nacional dirigido por DOUGLAS BRAVO está llevando a cabo la lucha armada, y que este esfuerzo si tendrá éxito.

RICO GALAN me pidió que le leyese un reciente artículo sobre Venezuela escrito por MARIO MENENDEZ, director de Sucesos, quien hace poco estuvo en Venezuela y entrevistó a los líderes del FLN. Así lo hice, y a una pregunta mía, RICO GALAN describió a MENENDEZ como un periodista castrista.

7.- También hizo una descripción de México como una aparente democracia, siendo más bien un Estado Policiaco férreamente sostenido. Dijo que aquí se están comenzando a iniciar movimientos populares. También a una pregunta mía sobre quién dirige estos movimientos populares y revolucionarios en México y en América Latina, RICO GALAN replicó que ya no hay líderes como CASTRO y que los mismos surgirán de entre los escritores, intelectuales y licenciados.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

8.- Redí a RICO GALAN que me diese evolución de la situación del ICO GALAN dijo que con respecto a la
evolución de Cuba, esto es, como comunista o no, dice un concepto y una total. Dijo, antes que eso es un comunista, apuntó que luego él podía explicar qué clase de comunista, antes que eso es un comunista que luego él podía explicar qué clase de comunista, a él como líder revolucionario. Luego, que no nombre a tipos que principalmente tienen influencia cubana o soviética.

Respondió que si tiene influencia o no. Nombre a tipos que principalmente tienen influencia cubana o soviética. Respondió que si tiene influencia cubana o soviética. Respondió que tiene influencia dominante en Chile, Argentina y México. Agregó sin embargo que en México, CASTRO y los soviéticos tienen política paralelas, pero que CASTRO no es capaz de hacerlo. Con respecto al paradero del CCUU Vi, dijo que tal vez ni él propio CASTRO sepa donde están.  También dijo que CASTRO ha convertido a el Casino en un instrumento de los revolucionarios soviéticos, pero que

9.- En relación con los conflictos Cubano-soviéticos, RICO GALAN dijo que son aparentes, que reales.

Luego le pedí no nombrar a quienes tengan influencia de los conflictos cubanos soviéticos, Rico dijo que con visión aparentes que reales. Luego le pedí no nombrar a quienes tengan influencia cubana o soviética en Guatemala, todo centro América y Colombia. Quo los soviéticos tienen influencia dominante en chile, Argentina y México. Agregó sin embargo que en México, CASTRO y Losch se ven frente a frente y tienen políticas paralelas, pero que la fuerza principal que capuja ca cotes po políticas os insia.

10.- RICO GALAN dijo que la influencia Chino-comunista on América Latina es insignificante.

11.- Después de aproximadamente una hora, nuestra entrevista termino abruptamente, porque un guardia de la oficina del Director de la fricción vino a llevarse a 100 GALAN que su abogado quería verlo. Sólo lo retuve un minuto más y  a nuestro porgar nos doopediños con un fuerte sprotón do manos.

12.- Todo lo anterior revela claramente cho RICO GALAN og un convencido y forviento no revoluciona. De acuerdo con lo que dijo, creo que estu aso asociado a una causa victoriosa. Tenía muy altu la moral y muy buena apariencia.

13.- Regresó a la Penitenciario de Locumberri aproximadamente: a los diecisiete quince horas de esa misma tarde para otra chorla con Hou C. In puerta principal estaba cerrada. Toqué y un guardia abrió una pequeña mirilla, cedi ver cl rector, pero of quedo no dijo que no se encontrado. Le expliqué quién ore jo y qué era lo que deseaba, pero cuando el guardia oyó ol nombre de Ice, dijo que era imposible verlo y cerró lo cirillo. Un momento después toqué de nuavo, le pregunté al guardia que si podía pasarle un mensaje a RICO.

Addonda, 17 January 1967, at Headquarters

1. My offer to Rico Calan (para 4) to pay him for an article he might write for CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA was made at the suggestion of LIENVOT/2.

2. The only time Rico asked me not to quote his (in any article I might write) was after he had finished telling me that Castro was too dependent on the Russians (para 8). Of course, I agreed. Also, Rico qualified his comment that Castro was a great leader by saying Castro vas unpredictable; he would say one thing one day and do something different the next day.

3. Regarding the abrupt ending of the meeting after just one hour (para 10) I think it is probable that this came about through an order coming down from LITEMPO/8.

4. General Commont: I was given a fairly rough time by the authorities at the Locumberri penitentiary. The Director told me in no uncertain terms that I could not bring a bottle of whiskey to Rico which I had in ay ALITALIA bag. On my way to the main reception area where the interview was held, I had to go through several offices and guards. At one point I was asked for my passport and the guards were quite indignant when I told them that I had left my passport at the hotel. When I showed then ay Italian calling card instead, they were not at all satisfied but let me pass on to the next processing point. Then I was taken to a private cell for a body search. I also had to sign in and out, presumably like any other visitor to the penitentiary.

5. The above incidents, though unpleasant for no at the time, indicato that LITENPO/8 had not made the Lecumberri authorition witting of ay true mission.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: LEEHOLD'S Contacts with LIENVOY/3 on Rico Galan case, Mexico City, 11-13 January 67

REFERENCE: Mexico City 9890 (IN 75995), 11 Jan 67

1. Reference reported that the Mexico City Station put LIENVOY/2 in telephone contact with the undersigned on 11 January. Following is a full account of ay subsequent contacts with LIENVOY/2 on 12-13 January on the Rico Galan case. L/2 served as out-out between the Station and LITEMPO/8 in arranging my interview with Rico Galan at the Lecumberri penitentiary on 13 January.

2. The evening of 11 January 1/3 phoned as at my hotel and asked to see mo the next morning; he suggested having breakfast together at my hotel at 0830. Но came on time and we spent about an hour together. He stated that his purpose was to find out for LITENDO/8 what my cover story and detailed plan were for the interview with Rico. At the outset he wanted to know whether I was an American or Italian citizen. Eo must also have been curious about my exact relationship with the Agency, but did not probe at all, and of course I refrained from volunteering any info,

3. L/3 sened satisfied with my cover as an Italian Journalist on a tour of Latin America for the Rome periodical, CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA. He approved also of the idea of my mentioning Carlo Coccioli to Rico as a follow journalist who had asked me in Italy in Deceaber to pay Rico a visit during ay forthcoming trip to Mexico. 1/2 ехргеssed the view, however, that it was rather unlikely that Rico would agree to sec ne. He said in Mexico prisoners in general and especially Rico, were very suspicious and rarely wanted to see strangers in prison. He then gave me a briefing ba


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 120

-2-

Rico which painted Rico as an extremely evil and clever character, who did not possess one ounce of sincerity, and who would never cease being a Marxist revolutionary, for stripped of his Marxist propaganda weapons Rico vas a nobody and Rico did not want to be a nobody.

4. I told L/2 briefly of my successful experience with a similar caso in the Philippines. He commented that it vas easier to be successful in the Philippines "for the lovel of Culture there, perhaps, is not as high as here."

5. Wo parted with the understanding that L/3 would phone ne at the C03's office later that morning after his Eseting with LITEMPO/8. When he called, at about 11:00, 1/2 said LITEMPO/8 liked the cover story and the plan but be wanted to increase the chances that Rico would soo me through the following maneuver. LI/8 wanted to send Elena Garro Do PAZ (the same woman who had brought out Rico's signod statement of his willingness to tell all in return for his freedom) to Rico carrying my calling card and an issue of my periodical; she would thon persuade Rico to 800 20.

6. During a later phone conversation with L/2 I polated out the risk involved in bringing Elena Garro into the operation. (The Station's position was definitely against her involvement). Being wealthy, influential, unpredictable and uncontrollable, Elona Garro, I pointed out, night make a phone call to the periodical in Rome and expose our hand. L/3 reported back to L1/3, who agreed with our position. 1/8 then came up with the idea of my writing a lotter of introduction for Rico and requesting an interview. I agreed to this schome. Later that evening I received instructions froa 1/2 that at 11:00 the next moraing I should go to the office of the Director of Locusberri penitentiary and request to see Rico. The previous day 1/2 had stated that LITELO/A wanted to go over the "whole agenda" sitt so before I wont to see Rico, but plans apparantely changed and I did not have any contact with LITEMPO/8.

7. At the meeting with Rico I personally handed Rico the lotter of introduction, and got it back from him aftor be bad read it. In the alddle of our interview Rico naked zo have the letter again and I banded it to his. Hy plan bad boen not to have the letter end up in Rico's hands if possible, but the abrupt ending of the meeting prevented by gotting it back. During the briefing of 1/2 by the COS and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

ne after my meeting with Rico, we asked that LITEMPO/8 try to get this lettor back from Rico through the penitentiary authorities. L/2 agrood that it would be a good idea to get the lotter back and said he would discuss this matter with LITEMΡΟ/8.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : LEEHOLD'S Contacts with LIENVOY/2 on Rico Galan case, Mexico City, 11-13 January 67

REFERENCE: Mexico City 9890 (IN 75995), 11 Jan 67

1. Reference reported that the Mexico City Station put LIENVOY/2 in telephone contact with the undersigned on 11 January. Following is a full account of my subsequent contacts with LIENVOY/2 on 12-13 January on the Rico Galan case. L/2 served as out-out between the Station and LITEMPO/8 in arranging my interview with Rico Galan at the Lecumberri penitentiary on 13 January.

2. The evening of 11 January L/2 phoned me at my hotel and asked to see me the next morning; he suggested having breakfast together at my hotel at 0830. He came on time and we spent about an hour together. He stated that his purpose was to find out for LITEMPO/8 what my cover story and detailed plan were for the interview with Rico. At the outset he wanted to know whether I was on American or Italian citizen. He must also have been curious about my exact relationship with the Agency, but did not probe at all, and of course I refrained from volunteering any info.

3. L/2 seemed satisfied with my cover as an Italian journalist on a tour of Latin America for the Rome periodical, CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA. He approved also of the idea of my mentioning Carlo Coccioli to Rico as a fellow journalist who had asked me in Italy in December to pay Rico a visit during my forthcoming trip to Mexico. L/2 expressed the view, however, that it was rather unlikely that Rico would agree to see me. He said in Mexico prisoners in general and especially Rico, were very suspicious and rarely wanted to see strangers in prison. He then gave me a briefing on


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

-2-

Rico which painted Rico as an extremely evil and clever character, who did not possess one ounce of sincerity, and who would never cease being a Marxist revolutionary, for stripped of his Marxist propaganda weapons Rico was a nobody and Rico did not want to be a nobody.

4. I told L/2 briefly of my successful experience with a similar case in the Philippines. He commented that it was easier to be successful in the Philippines "for the level of Culture there, perhaps, is not as high as here."

5. We parted with the understanding that L/2 would phone me at the COS's office later that morning after his meeting with LITEMPO/8. When he called, at about 11:00, L/2 said LITEMPO/8 liked the cover story and the plan but he wanted to increase the chances that Rico would see me through the following maneuver. LI/8 wanted to send Elena Garro De PAZ (the same woman who had brought out Rico's signed statement of his willingness to tell all in return for his freedom) to Rico carrying my calling card and an issue of my periodical; she would then persuade Rico to see me.

6. During a later phone conversation with L/2 I pointed out the risk involved in bringing Elena Garro into the operation. (The Station's position was definitely against her involvement). Being wealthy, influential, unpredictable and uncontrollable, Elena Garro, I pointed out, might make a phone call to the periodical in Rome and expose our hand. L/2 reported back to LI/8, who agreed with our position. L/8 then came up with the idea of my writing a letter of introduction for Rico and requesting an interview. I agreed to this scheme. Later that evening I received instructions from L/2 that at 11:00 the next morning I should go to the office of the Director of Lecumberri penitentiary and request to see Rico. The previous day L/2 had stated that LITEMPO/8 wanted to go over the "whole agenda" with me before I went to see Rico, but plans apparantely changed and I did not have any contact with LITEMPO/8.

7. At the meeting with Rico I personally handed Rico the letter of introduction, and got it back from him after he had read it. In the middle of our interview Rico asked to have the letter again and I handed it to him. My plan had been not to have the letter end up in Rico's hands if possible, but the abrupt ending of the meeting prevented my getting it back. During the briefing of L/2 by the COS and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 130

-3-

me after my meeting with Rico, we asked that LITEMPO/8
try to get this letter back from Rico through the
penitentiary authorities. L/2 agreed that it would
be a good idea to get the letter back and said he would
discuss this matter with LITEMPO/8.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/COG

SUBJECT: Possible Re-Interview of Victor Rico Galan (201-336474).

REFERENCE: Moxico City 9925 (IN 77986), 14 Jan 57

1. Referenco summarized the undersigned's first interview with Rico Calan at the Lecumberri ponitentiary on 13 January. At that interviow Rico apparantly assumed and accepted that I was a fellow Marxist journalist, on a tour of Latin America for the Italian periodical, CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA. HO talked freoly as a revolutionary in general terms about revolutionary movements and leadors in Latin America, including the Cuba and Soviet roles.

2. My attempt to have a second interview with Rico was not successful, due to circumstances beyond my and Rico's control The question now is whether we should plan to go through with a second interview. The purpos would be to obtain further information on revolutionary movecents and leaders. (The requiroments of the Mexican Government were satisfied with the first interview),

3. One possibility might be for me to see Rico in about 10-12 days, ostensibly after a return trip to Marico from Panama (or Guatemala or some other country). I could mention to Rico the names of one or two Communist leaders of the country visited who had briefed me; I could also reveal somo other deception or slahted information; including names of Castroits leaders; then wait for, or elicit, Rico's comments and observations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

-2-

4. As noted above, the purpose of a follow-up interview would be to obtain more detailed information from Rico on the Castro and Soviet roles in supporting revolutionary movements in Latin America, not merely to obtain further information on the country visited. The approval of the Mexican Government (LITEMPO/8) would again bo necessary for such a follow-up interview.

# SUBVERSIVE INS CRISIS-1 Nogales 12/16

The newspaper, EL MEXICANO, published at San Luis, Sonora on November 10, carries an article captioned, "The Lot Owners Union How Does Hot Show Signs of Activity." The story indicates that the Mexican Supreme Court had ruled that the expropriation of the lands belonging to the Ejido San Lalo was legal. (Reference is made to Nogales, Arizona Intelligence Report of August, 1966.) (UNCLASSIFIED)

The Partido Popular Socialista (PPS) has held infrequent meetings about twice a month in San Luis, Sonora recently, according to a reliable source. In February, they plan to hold meetings weekly in connection with stopped-up activities during the coming political campaign. The local committee from San Luis, Sonora, headed by LORENZO MOLINA-VILLA, recently were successful in forming a bloc or group of the PPS at Camp 57, Sonora. The source states this group has been organized strictly for political purposes and that the membership have not so far been indoctrinated on regular members of the PPS. (CONFIDENTIAL.)

This source also reported concerning stories brought back from PPS headquarters at Hermosillo, Sonora recently by LORENZO MOLINA-VILLA. One of these alleges that two Americans with United States

Communist's credentials (reference is made to Nogales, Arizona Intelligence Report of November 4, 1966) had been instrumental in the arrest of ENRICO-GALAN and associates a few months ago by Mexican authorities. They are said to have gained the confidence of this group, furnished money for arms, and then denounced them to the Mexican government. They are believed to be CIA agents. Another incident was the occasion when two Americans with United States Communist's credentials visited the president of the PPS in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico, who then communicated with VICENTE LIZARRARDO-TOLEDANO, who in turn arranged for photographs of the men to be sent to the United States to be identified to see if they were United States Communists. It was said that they could not be identified and, therefore, were believed to be CIA agents. (CONFIDENTIAL)

A plenum of the PPS was to be held at Hermosillo, Sonora on December 9, 1966. (CONFIDENTIAL)

SUBJECT:
Victor RICO Galan

1.  Attached for your information is a copy of a piece written and signed by Victor RICO Galan (Attachment "A") which he gave to Elena Garro DE PAZ to pass to LNPURE. She handed it to IDENTITY who in turn gave it to Bernard A. Edebrook. Attached also is a copy of the covering note written by Mrs. DE PAZ (Attachment "B") and rough translations of both pieces.

2.  On 1 December COS gave LITEMPO-8 a photostatic copy of Attachment "A". LITEMPO-8 said that he too had received a copy of the piece which he had given to LITEMPO-4 who sent one of his officers to interview RICO. RICO readily admitted that the signature was his, that he and Mrs. DE PAZ had discussed the matter, that Mrs. DE PAZ had typed out the copy and had brought it to him in prison where he had signed it. LITEMPO-8 said also that RICO Galan had said that he was eager to talk to a HOTACT representative. LITEMPO-8 said that he had no objection to such an interview.

3.  In the opinion of LITEMPO-8 the RICO Calan statement is merely a maneuver by which RICO Galan hopes to get out of jail by promising to supply information and to oppose Fidel CASTRO.

4. On 5 December, LITEMPO-4 told COS that RICO Galan is
   "almost crazy" for several reasons; confinement of course; his
   fear that his "friends" are going to kill him or that the Mexican
   Government will "arrange his death, and because he has learned
   that his wife, Inge, is sleeping with Manuel MARCUE Pardinas,
   editor of POLITICA (NOTE: According to Mrs. DE PAZ, Rosendo
   Gomez Lorenzo of SUCESOS is pursuing Mrs. RICO Galan.) LITEMPO-4
   commented that right now RICO Galan is willing to do almost any-
   thing to get out of jail.

Habiendo tomado parte en Ins graves discusiones surgidas entre Fidel Castro y Che Quevara antes del conflicto de Janto Domingo, a proposito de las tacticas, lineas y pactos n seruir en America Latina y que ocasionaron la desaparición del Che Guevara me considero autori-ado a escribir un testimonio politico que desenmascare a Fidel Castro ante los revolucionarios de la America Latina como a un agente del stalinismo. La derrota de Caamaño, el asesinato de Uceda el líder peruano, el crimen de Turcios eto. han aido éjécutados por agentes castristas, encargados de asesinar y destruir a todo aquel que difiera de la linea castrista. Meinere, Cruz y vo mismo hemos sido entregados por agenten tales como Lizalde, Menendez y otros, para callar una verdad que debe ser conocida por los latinoamericanos. La próxima victima es Yon Sosa y muchos más que en anton momentos se esconden de los asesinos. Mi testimonio seria politico e ideologico ya que yo mismo escribi muchos de los articulos de Quevara, sin escabimar todos los nombres y detalles necesarios para desenmascarar a Fidel Castro y sus agentes.

SOURCE: Medium-level member of the Mexican Communist Party in the Laguna area
whose Party position requires attendance at policy-making meetings.
His reporting on Communist activities has been reliable.

1. On 19-21 August 1966 the Union of Local Societies of Collective Farm
   Credit 40-66 (USCE 40-66 - Union de Sociedades de Credito Ejidal 40-66),
   a Mexican Communist Party (PCM - Partido Comunista Mexicano) peasant
   front, held ito 8th Regional Congress at the USCE 40-66 headquarters
   in Torreon, Coahuila, with an attendance of 800 to 1,000 people. Every
   state in Mexico was represented. The meeting was presided over by Arturo Orona
   Gamez, member of the PCM Central Committee and Secretary for Peasant
   Affairs of the PCM Coahuila State Committee, and Ramon Danzos Palomino,
   also a member of the PCM Central Committee and head of the Independent
   Peasants' Central (CCI - Central Campesina Independiente), another PCM
   controlled group in the Laguna area. In addition to these two who spoke,
   the speakers were Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, First Secretary of the
   PCM Central Committee, and Agustin Borrel Gomez, Secretary of Organiza-
   tion of the PCM Coahuila State Committee, Conspicuous by their absence
   were Antonio Morin Rodriguez, member of the PCM Presidium with special
   interest in PCM political affairs in the Laguna area, and Juan de los
   Reyes, member of the PCM Central Committee who lives in the Torreon
   area. The main theme of the Congreso was the aim of the USCE 40-66 to
   promote the nationalization of all privately held agricultural land in
   the Laguna area. It wants to divide all land in the Laguna area into
   communal farms and completely do away with small private land holding.
   Martinez said that the Mexican Government was trying to plot against the
   PCM and gave as an example the 12-13 August 1966 arrest of Victor Rico
   Golen and some 40 others of the Popular Revolutionary Movement (MRP-Movimiento
   Revolucionario del Pueblo). He said that the PCM did not espouse the
   armed revolutionary policies of Galen, and that the Party was pacifist.[^1]

3. Also present at the USCE 40-66 Congress was Oscar Guajardo Gutierrez, Secretary of Organization of the PCM Nuevo Leon State Committee. He was trying to organize an interchange of ideas between the Nuevo Leon and Coahuila PCH State Committees, especially in the field of organizing new colle. Guajardo said that he had organized various neighborhoode of Monterrey against the police and the government. He was especially interested in contacting Orona and Jose Luna Ortis, First Secretary of the PCM Coahuila State Committee.

1. Source Comment: Martinez Verdugo was trying to get the support of the crowd

Headquarters Comment: A report on this Congress and the speech made by Martinez Verdugo on 21 August 1966, the closing day, appears in issues noc. 1845 end 1846, dated 23 August and 4 September 1966, respectively, of in Voz de Mexico, official newspaper of the PCM. The second port of the speech in no. 1846 is extremely interesting in that Martinez Verdugo takes issue with the manner in which General Lazaro Cardenas del Rio, leftist former Fresident of Mexico (1934-1940), proposes to achieve agrarian reform. Further, Martinez Verdugo decries Carderes again giving his political support to President Dies Ordaz, as he did on 11 August at Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero, when he also expressed his views on agrarian reform (Cf. Airgras no. 161, Joint Weeks no. 32, dated 12 August 1966, from the American Embossy, Mexico City).

2. Field Comment: All of the members of this USCE 40-66 Administrative Council are members of the FCM.

SOURCE A ranking member of the Mexican Communist Party in Nuevo Leon who has access to Party plans, He has reported reliable information on the Party for about six years.

1.  The plenum of the Contral Committee of the Mexican Communist Party (PCM Partido Comunista Mexicano) will take place in Mexico City on 25, 26, and 27 September 1966.

2.  The Campesino Congress of Torroon was attended by Oscar Guajardo Gutierrez of the Nuevo Leon State Committee. Guajardo WIII remain in Torreon until 24 August to attend the national plónum of the Independent. Poasants' Central (CCI - Central Campesina Independiente) which is being held concurrently with tho Сатреніло Congress.[^1]

3.  Lino Modina Salazar, in his capacity as member of the Central Committee and member of the National Trade Union Commission, was in Monterrey from 17 to 19 August to participato in a meeting of the State Committee to discuss the Party's trade union activities, because so little has been done in this field which the Party has had difficulty in penetrating. It was agreed that the publication of Accion Sindical, which has been dormant for some time, would be resumed as an initial step in planning trade union activity and that a study of the labor situation should be undertaken. Medina, who was not pleased with the outcome of the meeting, promised to return and to personally follow the progress of the trade union program since ho is the Contral Committee member responsible for supervising the activities of the Party in Nuevo Leon.

4. A meeting of members of the Independent Central of People's Organizations (CIOP - Contral Independiente de Organizaciones del Pueblo) was held on 19 Aujust to discurs plans to carry out agitational activities oarly in September in support of busdrivers and other unionized groups.

5. The campaign in support of political prisoners has been suspended until 25 September. The situation has become more complicated because of the recent increase in the number of prisoners, although in Nuevo Leon there have been no repercussions because of the roundup of the Ugalde-Rico Galan group.

6. With regard to the national meeting of university students, it cannot be said that it was successful since only three delo- gations were present - those from Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, and Jalisco. Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, Jose Encarnacion Perez Gaytan and other members of the Party Presidium were present, which suggests that the Party attaches considerable importance to its program for university action. This meeting was considered to be the first stage, to be followed by others. It is assumed within the Party that the Nuovo Leon State Committee is exper- ienced in university mattors since it organized the University of Nuevo Loon Union (STUNL - Sindicato de la Universidad do Nuevo Leon).

7. With respect to the PCM's electoral campaign, as yet no cand1- dates have been agreed upon, and it is clear that among those under consideration nono is of impressive stature.

8. Of interest are the efforts of Porfirio Diaz, head of the National Youth Institute in Monterrey, who is departing from the Party lino in attempting to form a youth group in which the Institu- tional Rovolutionary Party (PRI - government party) would parti- cipate along with the PCM and other leftist organizations. Diaz has held meotings attended by Octavio Leal Moncada of the CIOP, Javier Rojas Sandoval of the PCM, Jose Luis Sustaita of the National Democratic Students' Contral (CNED Central Nacional do Estudiantes Democraticos), other members of the PCИ, and representatives of the PRI.

Headquarters Comment: Issue No. 1845, dated 28 Augst 1966, of La Voz de Mexico, official newspaper of the PCM, reported that the Union de Sociedades de Credito Ejidal de la Comarca Lagunera 1940-1966 (LECEXL-1940-1966), headed by Arturo Orora Comiz, held its VIII Ordinary Congress in its headquarters at Torreon, Coshufio. Issue No. 1816, dated 4 September 1966, contained an article dated Torreon, Coahuila, August 1966, saying that the national plenum of the CCI had resolved to dissssoch te itself from the National Liberation Movement (MLN-Movimiento de Liberación Nacional), because of the latter's divisionist activities.

2. Source Comment: In fact, the STUNL wse not forwed by the Party since, when It was organized, there were no Communists among the teachers and other university workers. The union came into being as a result principally of the activities of a group of teachers from Freparatory School H. 1, and it had the support of the then acting Rector, Alfonso Rangel Guerra, who saw in the union possibilities for creating problems for Eduardo Lives Villarreal, the Governor of Nuevo Leon. It was almost a year later that Rolando Guzman, Tomas Gonzalez de Luna, and Horacio Salazar Joined the FOH, but their influence in the union cannot be attributed to this fact. The union has continued to exist because it hos Faintained its activities within legal bounds, deconding eini vagee and improved working conditions. ICH influence in the union is negligible: since, in addition to Guaran, Gonzalez, and Salazar, there are unly four or five other 10 beabero. The usaibilities of forming a national university union would awer to be remote, and it is doubtful that present plans in this direction vill ever materialise.

SOURCE Mexican intellectual who is a personal friend of Victor Rico Gelan although they disagree politically. Source has reported infrequently but reliably on Rico Gelan's activities. The reported information was obtained from Mrs. Rico Gelan and from a journalist.

Field Comment: The 7 September 1966 issue of *Siempre!* magazine, which appeared on the stands on 1 September, carried on pages 10 and 11 a letter written from prison by Victor Rico Galan explaining and defending his position and accusing the Mexican Government of being the real violators of the Constitution. On the following pages an editorial titled "Mexico No Es Una Insula de Gorilaa" (Mexico Is Not A Police State), which rejected the points put forth by Rico Galan, defended Mexican institutions and concluded that because of the magazine's devotion to freedom of expression, time and space had been devoted to what should properly be recorded as a minor police incident.

1.  Ingo de Rico Galan, wife of *Siempre!* writer Victor Rico Galan, said on 2 September 1966 that her husband was resigning from *Siempre!* because of the harsh editorial against him and his ideas which appeared in the 7 September issue of the magazine. Mrs. Rico Galan said that the editorial was far harsher than even President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz' comments on the matter which he included in his 1 September State of the Union message.

2.  If Siempre! refuses to publish her husband's letter of resignation, and she seemed to feel that this might be the case, Manuel Marcue Pardinas, of the leftist newsmagazine Politica, has assured Rico that he will publish it.

3.  On 6 September, the Journalist Froilan Manjarrez told Antonio Caram, of the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, that Eduardo de los Rios (Rius), the political cartoonist, had resigned from Siempre! in protest over the magazine's treatment of Rico Calan. Since it was doubtful that Siempre! will publish Ring' letter of resignation, arrangements have already been made with Marcué Pardinas to publish it in Politica.

4.  Manjarrez remarked that Siempre! publisher Jose Pages Llergo had blundered badly in his handling of the Rico Calan affair and that people who had never been especially sympathetic to Rico Galan were nonetheless totally disgusted with Pages. Rico is being spoken of as a brave man and Pages as a contemptible one, according to Manjarrez, as a result of the editorial?

1.  Field Comment: CS-311/12195-66 reported that it was uncertain that Politico would continue to publish after the 15 August 1966 188ue.

2.  Headquarters Comment: The 14 September 1966 issue of Siempre carried a letter to the editor written by Rico Galon, in which he expressed hie intense displeasure with the publication's editorial of the previou week. He asked that more consider withdrawn his intention to continue collaborating with it on a book section, saying that he would seek means of support for his family despite his confinement, that they may live in a manner worthy of revolutionary solidarity, not from elms granted by evil consciences seeking precarious tranquility. In a note of reply Siempre reiterated its disagreement with Rico Golan's viewpointe but added that it claimed neither to qualify nor to judge the personal conduct of a friend with whom the cagazine was permanently bound.

SOURCE Guatemalan professional man, former member of a guerrilla organization in Guatemala, who is believed to have good access to Guatemalan exiles in Mexico.

![signature]

1.  Rolando Collado Ardon, leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico and a member of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT - Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo), said that the arrest of Victor Rico Galan on charges of subversion was a good thing for the PGT. Collado was referring to Rico Galan's influence on Guatemalan guerrilla leader Marco Antonio Yon Sosa. According to Collado, Rico Galan prevented the PGT from persuading Yon Sosa to join the Party in 1963 because of Rico's Trotskyist interference, and the aid he gave to Yon Sosa at the time. [^1]

2.  Medical doctors Miguel Cruz Ruiz and Rolf Moiner Huebner, two of those arrested with Rico Galan, have been associated with Rico since early 1965. Both were very much involved in the medical doctors' strikes of lato 1964 which continued into 1965. When the strikes were finally settled both Cruz Ruiz and Meiner Heubner were dismissed from their jobs at the Social Security Hospital at Cuauhtemoc 330. They went directly to Rico Galan who put them to work, mainly writing medical articles for the magazine Sucesos for which Rico Galan worked?[^2]

3.  Rico Galan sent both Cruz Ruiz and Meiner Huebner to Cuba in 1965 and both are well indoctrinated Communists[^3]. However, neither belongs to any Communist Party or organization. Both, as well as Dr. Jorge Velez Trejo, also very active during the medical strikes, have traveled through Latin America making

contact with medical groups and attempting to inspire thom to anti-government activity in their respective countries. Also, while Cruz Ruiz and Meiner Huebner were working for Rico Galan at Sucesos they were giving classes in revolutionary activities to groups organized by Rico Galan.

Field Comments

1.  In October-November 1963, Rico Galan, ostensibly as a purely Journalistic exercise, went to Guatemala where he interviewed Yon Sosa in the guerrill leader's camp.

2.  CS-311/12133-65, 4 October 1965, presents an over-all picture of the medical strike situation.

3.  TDCS-314/02438-66, 22 February 1966, reported that Rico Golan arranged passages for Mexican doctors who attended a medical congress in Havana in February 1966.

Headquarters Comment: This report, however, does not give the names of Dro. Cruz and Meiner as having been invited to attend the XI Medical Congress and the VII National Stomatology Congress but states that Rico Galan, who was making ticket arrangements, had names of others invited to the Congressés.

4.  TDCS-314/02464-66, 22 February 1966, reports on the Central American activities of Dre. Meiner and Velez.

SOURCE Mexican security officer with access to information derived from investigative activities. His reporting is believed to be reliable.

1. At a meeting of leaders of the Mexican Communist Party (PCM - Partido Comunista Mexicano), attended by Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, Fernando Granados Cortes, Manuel Terrazas Guerrero, Gerardo Unzueta Lorenzana, and Marcos Leonel Posadas Segura, there was some discussion of the status of members of the group, headed by Victor Rico Galan and Raul Ugalde Alvarez, which was recently arrested for engaging in subversive activities. It was revealed at this meeting that Ugalde had submitted an application for membership in the PCM but that he had not been accepted.[^1] He is not, therefore, considered to be a member of the Party. The same is true of Guillermo Balam Pereyra.[^2] It is true that Venancio Garay Zuniga and Artemio Garay Zuniga are PCM members, but they aligned themselves with the Rico Galan "guerrilla" group on instructions from the Party to serve as spies in order to keep the Party informed on the group's activities.[^3]

2. At a meeting of the Permanent Committee of the National Assembly for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, Filomeno Mata Alatorre stated that he was completely removed from the subversive group and that he had had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Guillermo Calderon Ita raised the question of the most recent group of prisoners (the Rico Galan group), and it was agreed that that group had chosen the easy path - that of taking up arms; that such a movement would come about eventually, but that now is not the time; there is no chance for success of an armed movement. It was agreed that even though the Committee

was not in accord with the tactics, or even the ideology, of the Rico Galan group, the latter group should be defended in the same way as are other political prisoners. The Rico Galan group has engaged the same lawyers used by the Committee. In fact, the campaign in behalf of political prisoners must be pursued with even greater viror because under the present Mexican Government policy the PCM or the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido Popular Socialista) could be accused of operating schools for training of subversives. At the close of the meeting it was reported that a message had been received from the Fourth Latin American Students' Congress (CLAE) in Havana advising that as part of the Campaign for the Release of Political Prisoners, which will be highlighted during the period 25 September to 2 October 1966, telegrams will be sent to the President of Mexico from all countries in Latin America.

Field Comments

1.  While there does not appear to be any firm evidence of Ugalde's membership in the PCM, his activities as a leading figure in the People's Electoral Front (FZF-Frente Electoral del Pueblo), which 18 controlled by the PCM, have been well reported.

2.  In a document seized by Mexican police during e raid on PCM headquarters on 12 April 1965, Dr. Balam Pereyra was listed as a member of the Dr. Angel Martinez Villarreal cell, having Joined the Party in August 1964.

3.  According to the Mexico City daily, El Dia, of 30 August 1966, the office of the Attorney General for the Federal District protested against the action of a Federal District judge in releasing the Garay Zunign brothers from custody on 22 August.

SOURCE Veteran and trusted member of the Popular Socialist Party who has close, personal connections with ranking members of the Party. He has been a prolific reporter of reliable information. The reported information was obtained directly from leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico. The substance of these persons' comments is believed to be accurately reported; its validity, however, cannot be assessed.

1. (Summary: Popular Socialist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the arrest of Victor Rico Galan and others on charges of conspiring against the Government remain unsympathetic. The Party intends to stay outside the entire matter, although PPS Secretary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano may seize the opportunity to strike back at some of his enemies by issuing a statement condemning the plans attributed to Rico Galan as Trotskyist. Within the Party there is considerable skepticism about the truth of the published charges. While several Party leaders do not doubt that there is some truth to the charges, they are quite convinced that there was no danger of imminent rebellion and that Mexican institutions stood in no peril from Rico Galan and his friends. The suspicion exists that Rico Galan's case is a Government maneuver, successfully used in the past.

Also, it is believed in the PPS that police accounts of their role in the matter have been exaggerated to enhance the reputation of the police both with the President and with the public. The rumor that the Guatemalan Government may have asked the Mexican Government to silence Rico Galan because of his violent attacks against the new Guatemalan administration is generally discounted since the complaints of Guatemalan officials are certainly of no concern to Mexico.)

2.  Victor Rico Galan and his associates can expect neither sympathy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido Popular Socialista) Although no official decision has yet been made by the Party, PPS loaders who have commented unofficially on the matter have said that for the moment the Party will no doubt stay complotoly outside the whole affair, thus proving its total lack of interest in this type of revolutionary activity. It is of course possible that PPS Secrotary General Vicente Lombardo Tolodano will seizo the opportunity to issue a statement condemning the entire affair as Trotskyist, criminal, and utopian. Lombardo may decido to use this opportunity to strike back at the National Liboration Movement (MLN - Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional) and others who have attacked him

3.  Among loaders of both the PPS and the Genoral Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico (UGOCM - Union Genoral do Obreros y Campesinos de Mexico), there is a certain skepticism about the truth of the matter as it has been presented in the press. It is probably true that arms and materials for manufacturing explosives were confiscated. It is probably true that indoctrination sessions on political and revolutionary matters were held in the houses where the arrests wero mado. And probably the group did have some kind of plan for action. But, it is simply not true that there was the slightest dangor of immediate and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his friends.

4.  This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan is no guerrilla leader. He is an aggreesive intellectual, a radical, but he is not in jail for what he has done but for his ideas, As for Raul Ugalde Alvarez, named with Rico Galan as one of the leaders of the group, he has the reputation of being fuzzy-minded, a leftist adventurer and certainly neither brave nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Galan is well aware of this, popular support is essential to the success of rebellion; it does not exist. The peasants are divided. The workers are controlled by the Government, and the middle class is content with the way things are. Also, there is the formidable precedent of Government action against any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed, and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected. The Government has always moved with onergy, speed, and officiency to combat such threats as, for example, during the Railway Workers Strike of 1959. Several lenders of that strike are still in jail and likely to remain there. Another example is the September 1965 attack on a military camp at Ciudad Madera, Chihuahua. While the Government did not feel that this incident. posed any real threat to it, it did not want the bad international publicity, so vigilance was increased, activities of would-be guerrillas were blocked, some were bought off with money, others with prozises, and the matter was promptly and efficiently controlled.

5. There no doubt is a degree of truth to police charges, but the melodramatic, almost childish character given to the Rico Galan.movement, the lack of any proven connection between the movement and leftist/Communist organizations, Rico Galan's open and well-known connections with Guatemalan guerrilla leaders and his public support of the Cuban revolution, mako it very hard to discount the suspicion that this is simply a Government maneuver. Also, while the police no doubt did confiscate arms and other materials, the suspicion exists that the police have inflated their role in order to make themselves look good both to the President and to public opinion.

6. There is even a rumor that because of Rico Galan's harsh attacks on the new Guatemalan administration, the Guatemalan Government asked the Mexican Government to deal with Pico Galan. This rumor however is regarded as rather ridiculous since the Mexican Government certainly cares nothing for the opinion of Guatemalan officials.

1. Field Comment: TICS-314/10419-66, 18 August 1966, reported earlier PFS reaction to the arrests.

Headquarters Comment: In his inaugural address in December 1964, President Diaz Ordaz made a point of stressing his desire for harmonious relations with Mexico's neighbors both to the north and to the south. His Central American trip in mid-January 1966 was, among other things, to promote such relations. Guatemalan friendship has lately been said to be a cardinal objective of Mexican foreign policy (Cf. State telegram no. 1245, dated 30 August 1966, from the American Embassy in Mexico City).

PLACE ACQ: Mexico, Mexico City

DATE ACQ: (7 September 1966)

SOURCE: Mexican intellectual who is a personal friend of Victor Rico Galan although they disagree politically. Source has reported infrequently but reliably on Rico Galan's activities. The reported information was obtained from Mrs. Rico Galan and from a journalist.

Field Comment: The 7 September 1966 issue of Siempre! magazine (which appeared on the stands on 1 September) carried on pages 10 and 11 a letter written from prison by Victor Rico Galan explaining and defending his position and accusing the Mexican Government of being the real violators of the Constitution. On the following pages an editorial titled Mexico No Es Una Insula de Gorilas (Mexico Is Not a Police State) which rejected all of the points put forth by Rico Galan, defended Mexican institutions and concluded with the observation that time and space had been devoted to what history would properly record as a minor incident because of the magazine's devotion to freedom of expression.

1. Inga de Rico Galan, wife of Siempre! writer Victor Rico Galan, said on 5 September 1966, that her husband was resigning from Siempre! because of the harsh editorial against him and his ideas which appeared in the 7 September issue of the magazine. Mrs. Rico Galan said that the editorial was far harsher than even President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz's comments on the matter which he included in his 1 September State of the Union message.

2. If *Siempre!* refuses to publish her husband's letter of resignation and she seemed to feel that this might be the case, Manuel Marcue Pardinas of the Communist newsmagazine *Politica* has assured Rico that he will publish it in *Politica*.

3. On 6 September, the journalist Froilan Manjarrez told Antonio Caram of the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that Eduardo de los Rios (Rius), the political cartoonist, had resigned from *Siempre!* in protest over the magazine's treatment of Rico Galan. Since it was doubtful that *Siempre!* will publish Rius' letter of resignation, arrangements have already been made with Marcue Pardinas to publish it in *Politica*.

4. Manjarrez remarked that *Siempre!* publisher Jose Pages Llergo had blundered badly in his handling of the Rico Galan affair and that people who had never been especially sympathetic to Rico Galan were none-the-less totally disgusted with Pages. Rico is being spoken of as a brave man and Pages as a contemptible one, according to Manjarrez, as a result of the editorial.

1. Field Comment: HMM-10,625 reported that it was uncertain whether *Politica* would continue to publish after the 15 August issue.

1. ON 15 AUGUST 1962 ANTONIO VARONA LOREDO, DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL (CRC), VISITED PRESIDENT ROBERTO CHIARI OF PANAMA AND REQUESTED CHIARI TO ORGANIZE AND HOST A MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN CHIEFS OF STATE ON THE CUBAN ISSUE WITH EMPHASIS ON INFILTRATION OF CASTRO AGENTS INTO CENTRAL AMERICA.

VARONA SAID THAT SUCH A MEETING SHOULD BE HELD AT A VERY EARLY DATE AND THAT CHIARI SHOULD INVITE PRESIDENT KENNEDY TO ATTEND.

CHIARI TOLD VARONA THAT THIS WOULD BE A MOST SERIOUS UNDERTAKING REQUIRING INTENSIVE STUDY AND THAT HE COULD MAKE NO COMMITMENT TO VARONA ON THE MATTER. ON 16 AUGUST VARONA LEFT PANAMA FOR SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, SAYING HE WOULD RETURN TO PANAMA ON

   ESTABLISHMENT IN PANAMA OF A TRAINING BASE FOR CUBAN EXILES.

3. ON 21 AUGUST PRESIDENT CHIARI SAID THE MAIN PURPOSE OF
   VARONA'S VISIT WAS TO REQUEST CHIARI'S APPROVAL OF A TRAINING
   BASE IN PANAMA, AND THAT HE HAD TOLD VARONA HE WOULD TAKE THE
   MATTER UNDER CONSIDERATION. HOWEVER, CHIARI DISCUSSED IT WITH
   MEMBERS OF HIS GOVERNMENT SUBSEQUENTLY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT
   PERMISSION WOULD NOT BE GRANTED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A
   TRAINING SITE:

4. HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: ON 13 AUGUST DR. JOSE MIRO CARDONA,
   PRESIDENT OF THE CRC, SAID IN MIAMI THAT VARONA WAS LEAVING MIAMI
   14 AUGUST ON A TRIP TO PANAMA AND COSTA RICA. MIRO SAID THAT THE
   PURPOSE OF THE TRIP VAS GENERAL PUBLIC RELATIONS WITH NO
   PARTICULAR MOTIVE IN MIND. HE MENTIONED THAT VARONA WOULD SEE
   PRESIDENT CHIARI WHILE HE WAS IN PANAMA TO DISCUSS THE CUBAN
   PROBLEM IN GENERAL AND ATTEMPT TO ENLIST "FURTHER SUPPORT FOR
   THE CAUSE." HE SAID VARONA WOULD ALSO INQUIRE OF CHIARI WHETHER

WHEN HE (MIRO) WAS IN THE AREA IN JUNE. THERE WERE APPARENTLY
REASONS FOR VARONA'S TRIP OTHER THAN THE OSTENSIBLE ONES STATED
BY MIRO. THERE ARE RUMORS THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE CUBAN EXILE
COMMUNITY IN MIAMI ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO OBTAIN HELP IN
CONVINCING PRESIDENT CHIARI TO PERMIT THE ESTABLISHMENT IN
PANAMA OF A CUBAN GOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE HEADED BY DR. MIRO CARDONA.

SUBJECT: REDHOOD

Unidentified Visitor to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City

1.  LICALLA and LILYRIC reported an unidentified visitor to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City between 29 November and 3 December 1965. The visitor appears to be a Soviet; however, LIFIRE has not reported any unaccounted for Soviet to have visited Mexico during this period, nor was the presence of a Soviet visitor reported to the Station by any other source. He has not been seen since 3 December 1965.

2.  According to LICALLA, the visitor was principally in contact with the cook, Anatoliy Aleksandrovich MUKHIN (201-293944), administrative assistant Stanislav Sergeyevich SILNIKOV (201-271103), guard Nikolay Ivanovich CANMARON, code clerk Aleksandr Petrovich PAVLON (201-761265), Third Secretary and known KGB officer Vladimir Ivanovich SHAKEVICH (201-343894), First Secretary and known KGB officer Aleksandr Vladimirovich HIKHODKO (201-202379) and Press Attache and known KGB officer Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV (201-132139).

3.  According to LILYRIC, the visitor was seen leaving the Soviet Embassy with MINHIN, and later with Third Secretary and suspect KGB officer Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOν (201-285412) on 30 November 1965. On 1 December he was seen leaving with MINHIN and his wife, Commercial Counselor Georgiy Stepanovich VISKO (201-243602) and chauffeur Anatoliy Pavlovich PRASACHIKIN (201-735052) in the car normally driven by Pravda correspondent Vladimir Agafonovich DOLGOV (201-763035). On 2 December he was seen leaving with MUKHIN and his wife, ZAKHAROW, visitor Ferdinand Robertovich CINNO and

XXX

1.  LICOZY/5 reported that on 12 October 1965 Subject visited his place of business and said that he had been referred to LICOZY/S by the Soviet Embassy. He said he was interested in a one-way ticket to the Soviet Union. Subject furnished the following information to LICOZY/5 : He was born on 19 August 1942 in Michigan. He is a student at U.C.L.A. and wanted to visit the USSR as a tourist. Subject held U. S. passport number C 530394 issued 29 August 1962. His permanent address was given as 19222 Pacific Coast liighway, Malibu, California. His tourist card showed that he entered Mexico by bus at Soncita, Sonora on 9 October 1965. Subject paid for 15 days in the Soviet Union but said that he planned to stay longer.

2.  He left Mexico via Air France flight 702 on 16 October (confirmed by flight manifests). His plans call for him to depart Paris for Moscow via Air France flight 724 on 17 October.

3.  During a routine visit to the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy, Valentin S. LOGINOV thanked LICOZY/5 for "taking care" of Subject but, in the presence of both PRIKHODKO and Consular officer Vladimir S. KORMUSHKIN, LOGINOV admonished LICOZY/5 for asking for more biographic data-than he needed to fill out the necessary papers. LICOZY/5 denied that he had asked for more information than he needed. (Subject apparently reported LICOZY/5's actions in obtaining the above biographic data (or was debriefed by LOGINOV, a suspect KGB officer).

4.  It seems unusual for an American student to travel from the U. S. to Mexico in order to travel to the Soviet Union since ho is automatically increasing the cost of his travel by a considerable amount. Since Subject crossed into Mexico on 9 October, only a week before his departure for the USSR, it would appear that ho came to Mexico exclusively for this purpose. It thus appears that the purpose of travelling via Mexico was to conceal this trip from the U. S. authorities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

SECRET

11. CURRICULUM VITAE:

A February 1960 Diplomatic List from Argentina lists Subject as a new Soviet Military Attache due to arrive in Buenos Aires in the near future. There is no indication that Subject ever filled that post.

From September 1960 to September 1963, Subject and family were in Havana where Subject served as an Attache at the Soviet Embassy. In December 1961, he accompanied the Soviet DYNAMO soccer team on a Latin American tour as their escort and interpreter.

Subject arrived in Mexico City on 3 August 1965 to replace known KGB officer Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO (201 305870), as a Third Secretary.

12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:

Subject is listed as probable RIS, probably KGB on the basis of his activities while stationed in Havana and by virtue of his replacing a known KGB officer in Mexico City.

13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:

While Subject accompanied the DYNAMO soccer team through La Paz in December 1961, he became acquainted with KISHIN-1 (Identity 1), a KUBARK Bolivian security service penetration and later a low level Bolivian university-cell CP penetration. It is not recorded upon whose initiative the contacts were made. However, by KISHIN-1's admission he had several informal and friendly meetings with Subject during which Subject encouraged KISHIN-1 to accept a Cuban student grant. In fact he specifically expressed an eagerness to be of any assistance in helping KISHIN-1 to get to. Cuba. KISHIN-1 never went to Cuba, although he did

SECRET

13. (CONTINUED)

correspond with Subject on the matter on at least one occasion. KISHIN-1 was terminated as an agent in July 1963 for security reasons and because it was believed that he was a fabricator. No further developments in his association with Subject were noted.

On the same trip through Latin America in December 1961, Subject was observed to have in his possussion some $2,000 in United States currency. After sending the soccer team back to Moscow from Quito, Subject continued alone through Panama City, where he was seen in contact with a Mexican citizen with whom he flew on to Mexico City. In Mexico City Subject reported to known KGB officer Aleksey Ivanovich GARMASHOV (201 227418) at the Soviet Embassy. From a sensitive source it was learned that GARMASHOV had been instructed to look into the matter of Subject's four-day delay in returning to Havana from Quito and that Subject's superiors in Havana were concerned. It is not known what relationship, if any, these circumstances have to each other.

In Havana early in 1963, Subject befriended and apparently attempted to cultivate VASLOUCHS 1, 2, and 3 (Iduntities 2, 3, and 4). The association was discouraged by KUBARK because VASLOUCH-1 and 2 were performing important functions in connection with Cuban FI activities and contact with a possible RIS officer was not thought desireable.

In September 1962 at the invitation of Senhor Vazco Leitao de CUNHA, Brazilian Ambassador to Cuba and newly appointed Ambassador to the Soviet Union, VASLOUCH-3 traveled to Moscow and accepted a clerical position at the Brazilian Embassy where she remained for approximately two years. A year later, in September 1963, Subject returned PCS to Moscow. Between December 1963 and February 1964, Subject made three attempts to see VASLOUCH-3. According to VASLOUCH-3, the contacts were by telephone only.

    and she did not meet with Subject personally while in Moscow.

15. CONTACTS:
    In December 1961 in La Paz, Bolivia, Subject was in contact with KISHIN-1. See paragraph 13 above and Identities.

Subject was in contact in Panama City and on a flight from Panama City to Mexico City in December 1961 with Edmundo Fausto ZORRILLA Martinez, a Mexican citizen who had been traveling around Latin America.

The nature of this contact has not been determined.

Subject befriended and apparently attempted to develop in Havana VASLOUCHS 1, 2, and 3. See paragraph 13 above and Identities.

Embassy offices. LICALLA thinks that Subject left the Embassy at 1115, having put has luggage in the car with license plates 19-DA. (This is the car regularly driven by LOGINOV.) A LICALLA photograph of Subject is forwarded as Attachment B (Headquarters only).

4. From LIENVOY it appears that LOGINOV was principally responsible for Subject's travel arrangements. LOGINOV probably met Subject at the airport, since LIMITED reported that LOGINOV left the Soviet Embassy in 19-DA at 0535 and returned at 0658 on 20 March 1966, apparently having dropped Subject off at the Hotel Agnes. Subject's wife was not reported to have visited the Embassy.

5. The Station had not believed that Subject would be able to take the 21 March flight to Havana, since there had been no record of his having requested a Cuban visa; however, a LIONION photograph subsequently received showed that Soviet Vice Consul Vladislav Sergeyevich KORUSIIKIN (201-744341) had visited the Cuban Embassy in person on 16 March 1966, at which time he probably arranged for Subject's visa.

PROCESSING ACTION XXX MARKED FOR INDEATING

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1. Subject has been identified as a AGR officer based on the following incidents:

2. On 12 February 1966 Aleksandr Vladimirovich PRIKHODKO (201-202379), KGB case officer, during a meeting with LICOZY-5 told LICOZY-5 that he would bring Subject to their next meeting and that Subject would be LICOZY-5's new case officer.

3. During January 1966 Cristobal TORRES Ponce, chauffeur employed by the American Embassy in Mexico City, made several trips to the Soviet Embassy in regard to a Soviet visa for one of the American Embassy officials. TORRES spoke with Subject, who, after asking whether it would get TORRES in trouble if he went to dinner with Subject, ended up by inviting TORRES to dinner on 24 January 1966. TORRES did not meet Subject that date, and on 8 February 1966 Subject called TORRES at the American Embassy to ask why he had not shown up. TORRES, replied that he had had to work. Subject asked whether TORRES had located a person who could teach him English. TORRES replied that one person whom he had asked had not been interested, and Subject asked him to keep looking for someone. Subject again called TORRES on 9 February 1966, but TORRES was out. (It is noted that Subject's calls to TORRES have not appeared on LIENVOY and were therefore presumably made from a pay station.)

PROCESSING ACTION:

1.  Attached are analyses of the KGB and GRU residencies in Mexico City. Included are only those officers who are probably or known to be intelligence officers. Of the 52 Soviets currently assigned to Mexico City, 22 are identified intelligence officers and 13 probably intelligence officers, i.e. roughly 67% of the total Soviet colony.

2.  The case officers have not been divided into separate target groups, with the exception of KGB S & T, s. ce the Station's information is too fragmentary for a realistic breakdown. With the exception of S. S. KONSTANTINOV, who is known to be the KGB résident, the positions of resident and deputy resident are inconfirmed, but represent the Station's best guess.

1. As reported in Reference A., Subject and his wife arrived in Mexico City at 0550 hours on 20 March 1966 via Canadian Pacific flight 421 from Buenos Aires. They departed Mexico City at 1300 hours on 21 March 1966 via Cubana flight 465 for havana. Cf. also the mention of their departure from Mexico City in the newspaper clipping forwarded as Attachment A.

2. According to LIENVOY, on 19 March 1966 Soviet Vice Consul Valentin Sergeyevich LOGILOV (201-235412, known KGB) made reservations at the Hotel Agnes in Mexico City (frequently used by Soviets) for a couple with a child for the night of 20 March 1966. This reservation was undoubtedly for Subject; however, there has been no other mention of the child. At 0830 on 21 March 1966 [Subject] called the Soviet Embassy from the Hotel Agnes and said he would like to come over to pay [perhaps for the room and the Cubana tickets].

3. LICALLA reported seeing Subject at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City at 1015 hours on 21 March 1966. Subject was seen talking principally with Embassy Counselor boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV (201-028975), suspect CPSU representative), and also briefly with Second Secretary Aleksandr Mikhaylovich DENISOV (201-726491) known GRU), Ambassador Semen Tarasovich BAZAROV (201-049257) and Consul Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV (201-120123, known KGB).

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM: Ernesto CHAZARO Peregrmo

SUBJECT:

1.  Reference le made to your memorandum dated 27 June 1966 and to the Interview with Subject conducted in Veracruz on 7 July 1966 by of your office and a representative of this office. We wish to make the following observations regarding Subject's statements in connection with his encounters with Soviet Embassy Third Secretary, Valentin S. LOGINOV.

2.  Regarding Subject's claim to have visited Mexico Ciry on or about 16 May 1966 and to have contacted the Soviet Embassy on or about 18 May 1966, this office has established the fact that a contact as described by Subject did not take place at any time during the period 10 through 30 May 1966,

3.  Subject made statements to the effect that he had ret LOGINOV and a second Sovlet at an unknown restauraux at 1800 hours on or about 18 May. He claimed to have talked to these two Soviets for approximately one hour (1. e, until about 1900 hours) after which they left the restaurant, walked to and entered LOGINOY's car, drove to an unknown apartment near the Soviet Embassy, parked the car and entered the apartment and then phoned three call-girls who who arrived within 20 minutes. Following the arrival of the girls Subject excused himself and left the apartment about 1900 or 1930 hours. To our knowledge there is no precedant for the KGB using call-girls for the purpose and in the manner described by Subject

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

-2-

4. Subject stated that he believed that the automobile driven by LOGINOV, an automobile that he had seen several times, bore the license number "67," Our records show that no Soviet Embassy official or employee drives an automobile with the number 67 or 76. LOGINOV drives an automobile with Mexico City diplomatic license 19 DA.

5. Subject's statements to the effect that LOGINOV despos Ited 50,000,00 Μexican pesos to Subject's account in the Banco de Londres in Veracruz as a "gift... for nothing" and then took the money back when Subject refused it, la not in keeping whh our experlence with regard to KGB modus operandi. Also, Information available to this office indicates that according to established Mexican banking practices it is not possible to set up a checking account without the presence of the owner of the account who must algn signature cards for comparison with the signatures on checks.

6. Subject's general vagueness as to daten, times, addresses and locations in connection with his encounters with LOGINOV, In addition to those points cited above, leads us to the conclusion that Subject has labriented a large portion of what he has stated. This office has little doubt that he did meet LOGINOV In Veracruz during early May 1966 In connection with the imlasing Soviet sailor, but we consider his account of contacts with LOGINOV subsequent to this occasion as fabrication.

7. In view of the above and in view of Subject's statements on 7 July to the effect that he had absolutely no destre to become Involved with personnel of elther the Soviet or American Embassies and wished to remala completely "neutral, this office is not considering using Subject as an Informant of any kind.

Valentin S. LOGINOV

In their reply to a request we sent them for traces of subject, our headquarters have replied as follows:-

"Valentin S. LOGINOV was Assistant Naval Attaché at the Soviet Embassy in BUENOS AIRES in 1960, and was listed as Attaché in HAVANA in 1961-63, where his exact duties were not known. If he now assumes NECHIPORENKO's post of Vice-Consul, his career appears to be an unusual one, and he must be presumed to be an intelligence officer".

Does this check with your own information?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

3. November 1965

FROM: ORONSKY

SUBJECT: LICOWL-1

Below is a summary of the noteworthy items from Bubject during meetings with him in September and October.

1. During September the meeting site was changed to the streets between Merida and Morel on Puebla street in Colonia Roma. Subject walks along Püobla street and I pick him up in the car and drive elsewhere for the meeting. I attempted to change the time of the meeting as well but Subject does not close his store until just before 2100 hours each day and feels that it would appear odd if he were to close the store at various times of the evening on different days of the week. His wife is not always in the store and he would have to close the store in order to meet me. He closes at 1400 hours on Sundays. I also instructed him to change the speed of the recorder from 1 7/8ths to 3 3/4ths. We have no recorders in the Station that will take a large reel at 1 7/8ths and this extremely slow speed is not necessary.

2. During early September Subject commented that there is a new apartment building being constructed on the corner of Gelati and Gereral de los Santos, across the street from the Soviet Embassy. (This is our new basehouse). I took considerable notes on this as though I had never heard of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 63

place before and asked several questions about it. He said that the owner of the_building is Sr. VILLAGRAN and that VILLAGRAN has the reputation of being an anti-Communist and a loyal Nexican citizen. He said that the building would probably be completed by Nars 1966 and that it will have about six floors. Several Soviets have mentioned to Subject that they would like to rent apartments in the building since it is so close to the Embassy.

3. Subject said that ISAYEV had been in his store about the last week in September. (As far as I can tell this is ISAYEV's first visit to Subject's-store.) ISAYEV made a great many anti-U.S. remarks during his visit to the store and blamed the U.S. for most of the world's troubles. At one point he said that the Soviet's made much better cars than the U.S. and that Soviet cars were built like "tanks". Subject laughed at this remark because the thought crossed his mind that only a soldier would like to drive a "tank" and from where Subject was standing at the time he could see the Soviet's new fleet of American Fords and Chevys.

4. I again asked Subject why the Soviets had not been visiting his store in the evenings as they had in the past and he insisted that it was because most of his "friends" at the Embassy had returned to the Soviet Union beginning in July and their replacements had not warmed up to him yet.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 64

I asked him if a small fiesta might not help this situation and he said that he thought that it might help. I told him to make plans for a fiesta in honor of Mexican Independence Day and to invite as many of the new Soviets as possible. He said that he would probably give the party on Friday, 17 September. I suggested that he invite Yuriy ANDRIANOV (the GRU chauffeur) first and tell ANDRIANOV to invite several of his friends. At the next meeting with Subject he reported that NIKIFOROV, LOGINOV and KORMUSHKIN were the only Soviets who came to the fiesta/on the 17th. They arrived, had a few drinks, danced to some Russian records which they had brought with them and then left. (All are KGB types). They told Subject that the other Soviets could not attend because they had to attend a Czech Embassy reception that same evening. / I can find no record of such a reception either at the Czech on Polish Embassies and there is no indication on the Soviet lines that they had anything planned for that evening. A Soviet from Cuba arrived on the 17th but we have no idea how many Soviets were at the airport to greet him. I questioned Subject about the Soviets who had appeared at the fiesta and he gave me a little information about them. They visited his store several times in the next few weeks and I showed him photographs of the men and expanded on his previous information. He had the following to say about them (he has previously reported on NIKIFOROV).

LOGINOV: Subject said that he believes LOGINOV replaced


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 65

NECHIPORENKO (correct). Subject calls him "the Bull" and described him as being vulgar, crude, ill-mannered, short tempered and a tyrant. He is a person who thinks that he is some sort of a "big shot" and when he sits down he spreads his legs and arms and takes up a space big enough for two men. His Spanish is very bad and he smokes "Fiesta" cigarettes. At the fiesta LOGINOV told him that he was from the northern part of the Soviet Union, is married and has children. He claimed to have served in the Red Army.

KORMUSHKIN: Subject likes KORMUSHKIN who is friendly, well mannered and outgoing. He speaks good Spanish and told Subject that his wife likes Mexico. Although KORMUSHKIN was wearing glasses in the photo shown to Subject, he commented that he often sees KORMUSHKIN without his glasses. He smokes "Record" cigarettes and Subject calls him "El Jovencito".

5. Subject said that ISAYEV had dropped by his store during the week of 18 October and spent some time making fun of the King and Queen who were visiting Mexico at the time. ISAYEV felt that the very existance of a King and Queen in 1965 was silly. He also claimed that the Soviets had discovered the Comet that was then in the sky. (The Comet had actually been discovered by two Japanese and bears their names.) He bragged about the great advances in the Soviet Union in all fields and told Subject with great pride that the ruble was worth more than the dollar. He commented.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 66

that the U.S. was a waring nation while the Soviet Union sought only peace and that the United States would change to something similar to the Soviet system in the near future.

6. The rest of the meeting and the next two, were spent discussing Stanislav SILNIKOV and his request that Subject act as "fiador" on an apartment for him as well as supply him with a prostitute. (see IIMMA-27568 of 4 Nov.)

7. In addition, Subject said that ANDRIANOV had asked him to get Viktor KALININ some aphrodisiac pills. ANDRIANOV said that they were "for Viktor KALININ in Moscow" but Subject thinks they are "for Yuriy ANDRIANOV in Mexico", Subject said he hasn't the slighest idea where to buy such a thing.

8. I told Subject to test the recorder by speaking into the microphones both in the upstairs room as well as in the main part of the store and then to play back the tape. Although RESCIGNO has explained the workings of the recorder to Subject several times, he claimed that he did not know how to do this. I then instructed him to disconnect the recorder and to deliver it to me at 2100 hours on Friday, 5 November. I said that I would test the recorder myself. He asked why RESCIGNO could not come to the store and test it and I told him that RESCIBNO was away. He then asked if RESCIGNO was a Mexican or an American. He said that RESCIGNO speaks Spanish like a Mexican and looks like a Mexican but that he (Subject) is sure that he an American. I told him


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

that I really didn't know since I had never asked him.
I changed the topic of conversation by saying that if he reported that SILNIKOV wanted a girl for this Sunday, I would return the machine to him on Saturday, 6 November. If not, he would get it back at the next regular meeting which I would set on Friday when I meet him.

# Contact Report/110419

16 August Spain's Resident

1.  The C.O. resumed acquaintanceship with Subjoct, and in the immediate and sizable vacuum left by Gerald F. Costetner's departure, tried to establish a friendly rapport with Subjoot. For this reason the C.O. gave Subject a more "friendly" name to know him by, Mel Berger- it being explained to Subject that Mel was the C.O.'s true first name. Subject thought the choice of Berger was good, because he knows several people of that name, and it would continue to use his normal manner of telephoning in, and asking for Monroy.

2.  Subject reported that ho had come back to Mexico from a trip on 10 August. Nochiporenko was at the airport to greet him. Nochiporonko had visited his office previously, and brought along his replacement "Valentin", and at that time had found out when Subject was expected back. Nochiporenko was invited by Subject to visit him at his home for breakfast on 11 August. He showed up alone. The only business discussed was that Nechiporonko said that Subject would be contacted by "Sasha" (Alexander Prikhodko). Subject was not to contact the Soviet Embassy, or in any other way try to reach Sasha. Subject had a souvenir pistol which he had obtained from some Cauloiter (presumably during WWII), and Nechiporenko asked if he might have it. Subject gave it to him. Nechiporenko evidently asked Subject to arrange for a one day trip to Paris for him while he was en route to the Soviet Union from his stopover, Brussels. (Subject complied, and notified his agent abroad. Subject received a wire a few days ago that Nechiporenko was "no show" in Paris). Nechiporenko was not interested in Subjoot's observations of U.S. attitudes toward the Viet Nam and Dominican situations, although Subject had been asked to note such attitudes while he was on his trip. Nechiporenko mentioned, without Subject knowing, that Catalina Torres, who had worked previously in Subject's office, who had attended the Mexican Soviet Cultural Institute, who had as boy friend the American who was giving English lessons to Nechiporenko (Gary Hodges?), and who had married some Mexican and was now in Acapulco with her husband (works at Las Brisas)- would be able to contact Nechiporenko by mail to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

3.  Subject is to call in when he is contacted by Sasha. His line to the Sovs about the travel agency in New York will be that he hasn't the time to select

the ranager or complete the study of the office's requirements, but that he is
baving going to have it done. On his personal affairs, Subject said he was
going to move in December to the Lomas, to a condominium apartment.

Attention "Paul"s the C.O. would appreciate knowing any collateral info about
Nechiporenko's departure, the identity of "Valentin", and

SUBJECT: REDTOP/LCIMPROVE - Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV (201-120123)

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

1. LITENPO reported the return of Subject, his wife and daughter Nataliya to Mexico on 21 September 1966 via Sabena flight 555 from Brussels (and Moscow). (Note that Subject's daughter Nina has remained in the USSR.) Subject and his wife were still travelling on the same passports used when they left Mexico in August 1966 (copies have been forwarded to Headquarters) and Subject is still listed as Second Secretary in his passport. The only addition to the passports is a Mexican entry visa valid for sixty days issued on 30 August 1966 in Moscow.

2. Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412) has been reported telling LICOZY-5, LICOWL-1 and LICANNY-1 that he is now the Consul General, replacing Subject. When LICOZY-5 asked LOGINOV what he was then going to do with Subject, LOGINOV said that it was not his decision, but that Subject would probably be put in charge of some department in the Embassy as First Secretary. The Station will keep Headquarters advised of any indications of the nature of Subject's present duties and status within the KGB hierarchy.

3. During Subject's absence on home leave, LILYRIC reported that suspect KGB chauffeur Vasiliy Stepanovich MIROSHNIKOV (201-273046) was seen driving Subject's car a few times. LICOWL-l also reported that MIROSHNIKOV was driving a car with diplomatic plates 26-DA, which is Subject's car

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
FROM: Oronsky
SUBJECT: LICANNY-1 (P-8415)

1. Subject is an official of Garza-Lopez Tours which is a representative for Inturist in Mexico City. We have had no contact with him since July 1944. At one time he had given the Station reports on various Soviet tourists and had been recruited prior to a trip to the Soviet Union in connection with Inturist. During the past few months he has been giving Don Lautz reports on various Soviet tourists such as the Soviet Orchestra which visited Mexico and Cuba recently. Lautz passed these reports on to me and Cynthia sent them home. Subject sees Lautz once or twice a week in connection with visa matters. He told Lautz that he had been contacted by KUBARK some years ago but that due to the pressure of his business he did not have time to write reports or to act as some sort of Double Agent. He said he was willing to pass along information on Soviet tourists but did not wish to become an agent for both the Americans and the Soviets. About a week ago Lautz told me that Subject had reported that Valentin LOGINOV, Vice-Consul at the Soviet Embassy, had asked Subject to supply him with information on boats and trains between Mexico and New York. Subject wanted to know what he should do. I asked Lautz if Subject wanted to talk to me and Don said that he did. I then arranged to meet him in Lautz's office at 1430 hours on 6 January.

2. Subject appears to be about 40-45 years old, 170 lbs., thinning redish hair, blue eyes, small brown mustache. He is well dressed and speaks native American English. I asked him about his contacts with the Soviets and he said that he had not had any extended contact with the Soviets for some time. During August 1965 he was approached by YATSKOV whom he knows as the Soviet Consul and was asked by him to prepare a chart of all commercial passenger ships operating between Veracruz and New York City "for the month of September". He also wanted the costs of travel and baggage. Subject has not given this report to YATSKOV. (A copy is attached.)

During December he met LOGINOV for the first time at the airport while Subject was attending to the Soviet Orchestra. LOGINOV did not know Subject and was very cool toward him until YATSKOV came by and greeted Subject warmly. LOGINOV then became very friendly and asked Subject's name. LOGINOV subsequently visited Subject's place of business and told him that he was the replacement for Oleg NECHIPORENKO (KGB Officer) and that Oleg had sent regards to Subject. He said that he hoped that he and Subject would be as friendly as Subject had been with Oleg. (Subject commented that he had not been especially friendly with NECHIPORENKO.) Subject said that LOGINOV's Spanish is almost native and that he (Subject) was shocked to learn that he was a Soviet. LOGINOV referred to YATSKOV's request and added that he also wanted Subject to include rail travel in the chart and he was especially interested in the cost of "excess baggage" by rail. He also wanted to include sea travel from Veracruz to Europe.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

3. Subject said that he did not want to become a D/A but that he would be willing to supply xxx whatever information he could concerning the Soviets he dealt with and the Soviet tourists. I asked if he would be willing to supply personality data on LOGINOV including LOGINOV'S background, education, family etc. He said that he would be glad to do this. He said that he would not be able to meet me on street corners or in restaurants and preferred to talk to me after he had finished his business with Don Lautz. I instructed him not to discuss his relationship with me with Don Lautz or with anyone else for that matter. axixthak He said that he would call LOGINOV and arrange to give him the report and perhaps have lunch with him.

4. Subject will never be anything exceptional in the way of an Access agent but I have asked Headquarters to renew his POA.

*LIOANNY-1*

A representative of Garsa Lopez Tours, S.A. who has furnished reliable information in the past called on me today to report that Mr. Loguinov of the Soviet Embassy has requested his agency to provide data on train schedules from Mexico to New York City and boat schedules from New York City to Europe. The Soviets were particularly interested in the train baggage allowance and the cost for excess baggage, he said.

Loguinov is a replacement for Oleg Neciperenko who was recently transferred from the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. My informant described him as tall, blond, blue-eyed, about thirty years of ago, and as a person who speaks fluent Spanish without any accent.

Contact Report: Meeting between Edgebrook and Kadiddle, 28 December

COS

On 28 December I called on Kadiddle at his residence, primarily for the purpose of setting up an elementary colpo ayeton, and to arrivo at salary arrangemnets with him. Salary was fixed at 450 por month, (slightly above what Aoora had suggested) and plus 100 allowance during the duration of his tour hore as Ambassador. As he bad previously roquested, I returned to him his receipt for 35,000 pesos, which he instantly burnt in an ashtray, with obvious relief. He commented that he hoped ho would never have to sign anothor, and it is clear that there may be some problom in working out a poed acknowledgomont. I will leave it for later, will certify the 1 Jan paymont, and try it on the following month. I asked him if he had boon having problems with his ponsolonce about taking money from the Americans, and he roplied that he had not been able to sleep the night after our first payment, but aftor talking the whole matter over with his wife (the stronger porsonality of the two) he had finally resolved it in his minds friends had to help one another, and if accepted the Americans as such - whion has always done - he should not be too proud to let them bail him out of a tight spot. "They were going to turn off the electricity, and there was only a thousand pesos left in our bank account".

For commo, we agreed, to call in his wife and consult together. She was more than sensible about holying, recognized both the uses and dangers of the telephone, and made some usoful suggestions. Porsonal contact, based on social relationship, is the basic arrangement, either at his house on mine. Tolephone contact to be only between his wife and mine, if either of the two women call and suggest seeing one another at any hour botween five and six, it means that either I am to call on Diddle at that timo kewxx or he on me, depending on the context of the conversation. Any other hour mentioned signifies social contact between the wowon themselves, who are, of course, available to pass written messages. Emergency contact

oan bo made by Diddlo himself, calling only from a pay tolophono, novor
from his house or office.

In regard to CE affairs, Diddle made two comments which he suggested I might want to me up with Eaobys

a. He asked me if I had met or talked with Noel Lindsay at (Vice President of Grant Advertising S A) at the dinner kaxgxx Diddle save Christmas night, and on learning that I had, he commented that Lindsay's oultivation of him had boon so assiduous that he was beginning to wonder if he was not dealing with someone who might be visualizing himself as his futuro British base officer. There was something about Lindsay, he said, that made him fool that he was assessing Diddle quito carefully. He askod if wo could runa file cheok on Lindsay himself and on Grant Advertising. I said I would chook..

b. Poarl Gonzalez has boon purouing him much too activoly; anking him to her house out of turn, wanting to do a profilo on him for tho English languago llows, of which sho is the Society Editor. What a porfoot. cover for acquiring bio data, ho explained, and what odd friondo oho had for an American, (sho is listed as a US national in the Anglo-American dir-cotory, and is, according to Diddld, either separated or divorood from a Moxioan husband) newspaper woman or not. One evening a month or có ago, ho had gone to dinner at her house, found most of the other guests spod on that thoir way rather unceremoniously, and was left with only Mrs Gonzaloz and two men, whop, he found to his surprise, were both Russians (names not recalled, and never very clearly given during the initial flurry of intro

ductions). These two engaged him in serious conversation:

Russians: How do you feel about Communism?

Diddle: There is something to be said for many if not all the important systems under which various countries are governed, however my primary concerns is not with Communiam in the abstract, but with the bout way for Ghana to be governed. He must take the best of all, and fit. them to our country.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 84

Russianes No, no, the question is what do you think porsonally about Communion? What are your own deliofa?

Diddies (getting the wind up at this point) Frimarily, I cust de described as a nationalist.

One of the Russians: was very tall, brunette, wavy aged about 38 thick hair, not obviously Russian in appearance, very good-looking. The other was middle height, doop lines running from the corners of his nose vortivally down his chooks, not so handsome, ago about 42. Diddle has not seen them since, although he has kept an eye out for them, oursing himgolf for not having their names. Conversation in Englih - which is about all

Diddle has, other than Fani and some Gorman. He believes he would be able to identify them from photographs.

Diddle's point in reviewing this in was not to let me know that there were Russians looking him over we both well aware of that but to point up Mrs Gonsales's role as a spotter. He does not think that she could have been unwitting of the role she was playing, and has avoided her since.

Regarding Andreyev, he suggested that I cultivate him, and on being told that I plans a dinner on 8 Jan (to which Diddle invited) for about 18 people, he commented that it would be an excellent opportunity to axs ask Andreyev as well. Doubtful, of course, that he would accept, but no opportunity to continue his exposure to us should be overlooked. He made the usual comments concerning Andreyev's differences from his colleagues,

Adding only that A had told him that he was basically internationalist inoutlook. As others, he senses something wrong in A's relationship with his wife. (Comments I did do not, as yet. She did not appear confortable in a large group of people she did not know, dancing to musio she clearly did not like: twist, frug & cetera, but they seemed to be on good enough tores. He was pushing her join in, but not impatiently)

Diddle asked for EEI's on the tri-continental congross; a number of. Ghanians will be transiting Mexico on their way_to and from Havana, ho... apakai specifically mentioned Dondorkonoo, whom he described as an anti-

Mrumah Chanian employed as a civil servant at the UN, and not someone he would have expected to be named as a delegate to the Conference, and John Tottogah, whom he said was a "crypto-democrat" at heart, and not the anti-westerner he is usually described as being. What Tottogah used to be, and what he really is at the present time are two quite different things. He has become a friend, says Kw-b, although he cannot appear as such.

I told him that Rattesoy would be coming on the sixth, more or less, and that I would get him a list of requirements for the Conference.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

FROM: Oronsky

SUBJECT: LICOWL-1

14 February 1966

1.  I met Subject on Friday, 11 February at 1900 hours. The meeting was a very short one since I only wanted to determine if he had found a girl for SILNIKOV to "paint". He said he was still looking.

2.  The boy who watches Subject's store at night did not show up on 7 February and Subject was forced to sleep above the store himself. At 0300 hours on Tuesday (8 February) he was awakened by the noise of a car horn and looked from the window to see Valentin S. LOGINOV and Vladislav S. KORMUSHKIN blowing the horn of their car in the driveway of the Embassy. Both Soviets were drunk and were yelling for the gate guard (who happened to be SILNIKOV) to open the gate for them. They were driving car 337-D (LEONOV's) or 336-D (KORMUSHKIN's). Subject returned to his bed and did not see them leave the Embassy.

3.  Since both LOGINOV and KORMUSHKIN live in apartments outside the Embassy and since they would not willingly go to the Embassy at 3 a.m. while drunk, it is likely that they were working when they got drunk and therefore had no fear of being reprimanded for it. They may have returned to the Embassy to make a report or to secure some classified materials before going home. Both men replaced known KGB officers and both work under Pavel YATSKOV.

4.  I set our next meeting 24 February.

1.  Reference is made to LIENVOY (three conversations on 12 and 13 January 1966) reports of conversations of Subject with Valentin LOUGINOV, Soviet Embassy Officer, and conversations of Mrs. Edith STENSBY (Citizenship, U.S. Embassy) with Soviets concerning a proposed visit by Subject's wife and daughter to the USSR.

2.  Paul Dillon and I advised Minister Boonstra (who was Acting Charge) on 14 January 1966 of this proposed visit and of the conversations we had learned about.

3.  Mr. Boonstra had not previously heard of this proposed visit of Mrs. MUELLER to the USSR. He said he would (without divulging CAS as the source) look into this.

4.  Later on 14 January 1966, Mr. George VARROS told me of the proposed trip. He said the Ambassador had personally approved. It (Mr. Boonstra later also confirmed this).

5.  VARROS also said he thought It "not good" for Mrs. MUELLER to make such a trip. He said (Confidentially) that she gets really drunk quite often and she talks about anything and everything she knows about. For example, she told at a party (when she was practically "blotto") about MUELLER's"taking pictures all over Mexico for CIA!"

6.  VARROS will give Mrs. MUELLER a pre-briefing (defensive briefing) Just prior to her departure. She will (and VARROS thinks this is wrong) be travelling on a diplomatic passport.

Wednesday, 6 April: SILNIKOV arrived about 1330 hrs and had a drink of tequila. While there, a high level Soviet came into the shop and after he had left SILNIKOV told him that the Soviet is studying Spanish in the Embassy. (This followed Subject's comment to SILNIKOV that the Soviet spoke very good Spanish). SILNIKOV said that each Wednesday all the Soviets must speak Spanish and those who refuse to do this must pay a fine. With the fine money they buy more Spanish booklets and records. SILNIKOV said that there are some Soviets who simply refuse to learn Spanish or Mexican customs, and that these people will probably not be sent abroad again. Commented that this would be a shame since Mexico has such excellent beaches, weather and everything is so inexpensive here. He left the shop about 1430 hrs. Subject was about to close his shop at 2100 hrs when Valentin S. LOGINOV came into the store. He asked if he could use Subject's phone and then made a long distance call to Cuernavaca and spoke to someone in Spanish. Subject could not hear what was being said but got the phone number - Cuernavaca 2-30-65. (I told Subject to bring me the phone bill when it arrives so that I can double check the number.)

CONTACT REPORT -

SUBJECT: Dr. Ernst GOEBEL

1. Subject called me on 23 March to report that he had learned a little which might interest me. We made an appointment to meet in his office at 1700 the same day. The meeting lasted for 20 minutes.

2. Subject stated that at 1200 hours on Sunday, 20 March, LOGINOV came to the French Club. He was accompanied by his wife whose salient features were redish hair which could be died and very generous proportions, "a typically stout Russian woman." Theye was also another Soviet couple with them. The man was described as very blond, boyish haircut with a part, not quite as tall as LOGINOV (ca 5'9"), with a solid muscular build, like a weight lifter. His apparent age was 25 to 35. His wife was dark haired, normal figure and also young. The two couples had three children with them all in the 4-6 bracket. Subject did not remember their sexes since he was concentrating on the adults. (COMMENT: I first thought that the second Soviet would be KORMUSHKIN but Subject insisted that he did not wear glasses (KORMUSHKIN always wears glasses). However, Subject's description fits GORLITSYN and wife perfectly. I will take pictures to the next meeting for confirmation.

3. Subject stated that upon arrival the two men went into the locker room and emerged in shorts. The women were already dressed in shorts. They had their own badminton rackets and repaired to a side lawn where they played badminton until Subject left at 1330. During the period 1200 to 1330 they did not contact anybody but simply played badminton among themselves.

4. Upon leaving Subject spotted LOGINOV's car in the parking lot noting the make, color and license plates.

5. Subject was apologetic about the paucity of his information. but I encouraged him and told him it was a fine start. Subject said that he had briefed his wife on LOGINOV and she will be on the lookout for him during the week. Subject appeared to be very much interested in pursuing this subject for me and gave every indication that he will keep working on it.

Loginov intimated to Suhj that he wanted Subj to be au courant and in the know on political events. He spoke of the Sino-Soviet split, mentioning the widely known reasons for the split but correnting specifically from the Soviet viewpoint on the Chinese hero-worship of Mao Tse Tung, the impalatyeness and belligerency of China es compared with the Soviet Union'a nuine policy of seeking peace. iic mentioned that China had had a break in the past two yours by havin; abundant harvesta.

Subj told Loginov about an upcoming trip to Copenhagen, which he is to undertake in behalf of the Chief of Mexican Tourism, Austin Solvat (aco attached letter). Lozinov asked Subj, if he were in Paris, to look up Ginette Polocel Porter, wife of the British NATO official.

Lovrinov said he would call Subj for their next ment.

3. The C.O. told Subj to prepare a superficial personality resume on the persens. wanted by "Loginov (this for. prior submission to the Station). Also, while in Pario, if it is not too much trouble, try to see Ginette Palacci-for the purpose of having some little to report to Loginov (naturally pre-checked by the Station) and also for the Station's benefit to discern if the Soviets abroad had made, any overtures to her..

4. Subj parenthetically remarked to the C.O., in a loosely defined manner of showing the activity of the Israeli Embassy in Mexico, that there was to 'be a Congress of Intellectuals in Mexico with about fifty participants from all over Latin America. The major theme of the Congress was to be The Situation of the Jews and Anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, but the theme was being held under cover as far as all advance publicity was concerned. (Attached in the announcement card for the Congress). Subj's firm is handling the arrangements.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: Dr. Ernst GOEBEL

1.  Upon receipt of POA on Subject, I called him at his office (Auxiliar de la Construccion, SA, Halbein 168, tel: 43-31-36) on 11 March 1965 and made an appointment to see him at 1800 on 14 March at the office. Since I had met him socially in the fall of 1965, he remembered me which facilitated the contact.

2.  I met with him from 1800 to 1835 at his office. He took me to a back office where we conducted the conversation. I stated my business briefly that I knew LOGINOV was a member of the French Club and I desired information about his activities and contacts at the club. He was in immediate agreement to help me in any way he could. I have him LOGINOV's full name, physical description, type and license plate of his car and showed him pictures of LOGINOV and his wife.

3.  Subject said that he had not seen LOGINOV at the club nor heard his name. He is sure that LOGINOV is not a tennis player which is Subject's only occupation at the club. Subject said he only goes there on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings to play tennis. However, his wife often goes during the week with the children. Subject agreed that both he and his wife would look out for LOGINOV. At my suggestion he agreed to make inquiries about LOGINOV from Club employees such as the manager or the bar tender who know everybody. He agreed to mask his interest by stating only he had heard that à Russian was a member and to express normal curiosity about this unusual fact.

4.  Subject immediately agreed to my request that this subject be a matter of strictest confidence between himself, his wife and me (his wife is an American citizen whom I have met and on whom we also have a POA). As I was leaving and thanking him for his cooperation, he expressed his appreciation in the confidence that I had in him in a matter of this nature.

5.  Towards the end of the conversation he asked if I worked with Al White at the Embassy. I said "no, but I know him." He answered, "of course, you would be with counter-

He did not appear to be the least suspicious about Allan. He
said he knew him through their wives (cancer work) and the
children and remarked that Allan speaks pretty good German.
Other than his telling me that I work in counter-intelligence,
he did not ask any questions about my position in the Embassy.

6. Subject made a very good impression; direct, businesslike
   and no nonsense. He said that he would call me in tow or three
   weeks to advise the results of his investigation.

Reference is made to your memorandum entitled "Travel of Soviets," dated February 3, 1966, your number 10097.

Enclosed herewith for reference are copies of the crew list of the Soviet ship "Vnushitelnyi."

A source, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised that the above ship arrived in the harbor at Mazatlan, Sinaloa, on February 2, 1966, and remained there until 3:30 P.M., on February 5, 1966.

According to this source, VALENTINE S. LOGINOV, a Third Secretary of the Embassy of the USSR, visited the ship, arriving by air from Mexico City and was staying at the Hotel Freeman in Mazatlan. According to this source, national intelligence operatives in Mazatlan reported LOGINOV had no contacts while in the city except with the ship's crew. No attempt was made by the Soviets to introduce propaganda material from the ship.

On February 21, 1966, PEDRO ZARATE MARMOLEJO,
Commandant of the Customs Guard, Maritime Customs Office,
Mazatlan, Sinaloa, advised that his men have been carefully
watching the elements of the Soviet whaling fleet that are
currently visiting Mazatlan. They have been alerted to the
importation of any propaganda or contraband, but, as yet,
nothing has transpired. When the flagship of the Soviet whaling
fleet arrived recently, there was no one aboard who spoke
Spanish or English, and the Captain seemed to be completely
lacking in instructions about documents in order to enter the
harbor. He did not have the necessary papers prepared. A
Soviet Embassy official was sent from Mexico City in order to
straighten matters out.

ZARATE said that the purpose of the visit of the
whaling ships was to take on fresh water and supplies. The
crews were also given liberty.

Also enclosed herewith for reference are copies of
the crew list of the Soviet vessel "Iskatel" which visited
Mazatlan on January 9, 1966.

In connection with the visit of the "Iskatel," it
is noted that a Soviet Embassy car, believed to contain Soviet
Commercial Consul GEORGIY STEPHANOVICH VISKO and USSR Embassy
chauffeur VASILIY STEPHANOVICH MIROSHNIKOV, was observed on
the highway leading to Mazatlan on January 11, 1966, and was
subsequently observed on January 14, 1966, in Mazatlan.

This office is attempting to obtain the crew list
of the Soviet whaling vessels that have visited Mazatlan during
February, 1966, and will make them available when obtained.

Contact Report/-5
3 March 1966.
Subject's office

1. Subj reported that on Tuesday, 22 Feb, he was visited by Valentin Loginov,
   his prior case officer, who dropped in without prior notification to arrange
   accommodations for Nikolai Khlebnikov and for Frigova and daughter for
   Loginov wanted to talk, but Subj said he had to make an appointment,
   and hastily arranged a luncheon meet for 25 Feb 1400 at the La Borda Restaurant
   on Bolivar Street. /Comments: Subj stated that he called in to the Station on
   23 Feb after the luncheon. Had the C.O. been apprised of this call, the Station
   probably would have received the advance notice re Khlebnikov and his Soviet
   flight companions/

2. Loginov came to Subj's office on 23 Feb and together they went to the
   La Borda Restaurant.

Loginov repeated Aleksandr Prikhodko's interest in Subj's health and
offered to send the report on Subj's condition from the Temple Clinic to
Moscow. Subj asked Loginov why he wanted the report, and Loginov answered
"We want to take care of your health." /Comments: Subj will not comply/.

Loginov startled Subj by asking what he knew about the super-secret Jewish
organization "Pluga" /Comment: Subj explained to the C.O. that "Pluga" was formed
all over Latin America after the arrest of Eichmann had caused Nazi-like anti-
Semitic organizations to spring into being in the Latin countries. Jews formed
"Pluga" (which is a Hebrew word meaning some kind of military unit) in order
to receive military training. Subj knows about the organization through his
contacts in the Israeli Embassy in Mexico although he is not a member. He
quotes the Mexican contingent at about 25 to 30. The Israeli Govt sent an
organizer-and-instructor to Mexico. Members have gone from Mexico to Israel
for training (Subj knows because he handled their travel arrangements)./

Loginov stated that he would like to know about the members of "Pluga", because
"it would be interesting if this organization could work for them (the Soviets)".
Loginov was pleased with Subj's remark that the organization was militantly anti-
Nazi. Subj indicated without too much enthusiasm that he would do what he could.

Loginov put another request to Subj in a rather desultory manner, asking
-Subj's cooperation if Subj "wants to, can or will" comply. Loginov remarked:

2. 
that to know that you have friends among the French officials in the French
Pebe and wanted Subj to find out the reaction of these officials to

a) De Gaulle's declaration against the U.S. in Viet Nam b) De Gaulle's views
on French withdrawal from and c) a third point that Subj could not recall.
and he would try. /*Comment:*/ Subj does know well (the French Press Attache,
but he didn't tell that to Loginov/.

Jo trov told Subj that the Soviets were anxious to recruit someone in the
(Institution of Gobernacion, Some "small fry", and that Subj should not stop the ? recruitment
scene for them. Subj said he would think about it.

Teethov requested information about the employees who worked for Subj
Subj gave most of the employees in his office, and gave the briefest of details
about them, Subj was nonplussed by the question, but he did not ask Loginov
why he wanted the information. /*Comment:*/ Subj expressed to the C.O. his fear
that the Soviets might try to recruit someone in his office, and for that reason
that it best for the C.O. to limit his personal calls to the office. The
C.O. agreed on the need for caution on general principles, but thought it
unlikely that Loginov would so blatantly advertise his intentions of subverting
Subj's personnel. Nevertheless, the C.O. suggested to Subj, that this might
constitute a "sore point" in Subj's relations with Loginov and be exploited as
an irritating factor for the future/. Loginov did not write down the names of
the employees.

Loginov brought up the answers to Prikhocko's questions. Subj said they
weren't ready. Loginov asked if Subj could have them by next time. Subj said
he would try.

/*Comment:*/ For all the above requests the C.O, instructed Subj to do nothing,
explaining that we were awaiting definitive word from Washington on the course
of the operation. Subj is prepared for the eventuality that wo may wish to
break off his relation to the Soviets/.

3. Subj asked Loginov directly if this were his first job abroad. Loginov
   reported that he had been in Latin America for a couple of years, and mentioned
   specifically: Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Chile. When Subj remarked that the
   Soviets didn't have official representation in these countries, Loginov answered
   that he had been in commercial missions and other missions. Subj stated it as
   his impression, because Loginov mentioned having been in the jungles and in
   provincial terms, that Loginov had been on special missions of sabotage.

Help partially heard Loginov say about "the jobs,"
and that "we are not refusing to have a comment or invitation from him."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

3. 
The C.O. asked Subj how he sized up Lorinov. Subj said he wanted more time to formulate his impressions, but noted that Loginov is not "tonto", speaks slowly, and uses the soft approach.

4. Subj moved to his new condominio apartment on 26 February. The telephone is 42-14-10. The address, already reported to the Station, is Av. Cumbres de Acultzingo 20 Dept. 602, Lomas Altas, Mexico 10 D.F.

5. Subj was annoyed that at his last call-in on 3 March to ext. 370 he was asked his name. He refused to give it, believing he was sufficiently identified by asking for Herb. The C.O. recommends that the latter be accepted to designate the caller in this instance.

Contact Report/1500-5
10 Feb 1220, Subject's office

1. At the time of delivering to Subj on the evening of 15 Feb a case of wine that he had requested, the C.O. permitted Subj, at the latter's suggestion, to make a "rush-in" show for his meet with Vladimir Prikhodko on 16 Feb at Sanborns Restaurant, Insurgentes, at 0900.

2. Subj reported on 19 Feb the story of his brush-off meet with Sasha on 16 Feb. He told Sasha, when he found standing to the side of the restaurant in Sanborns, that he was sick, and had got up out of a sick bed against his wife's instructions, just to show Sasha that he wasn't trying to avoid a meeting - but, he was too sick to stay. Sasha accompanied Subj outside and walked with him toward Subj's home.

Sasha told Subj to submit to him the findings of the Temple Clinic on Subj's illness, and he would forward them to Moscow (for medical advice). /Comment: Subj has no intention of doing so/

Subj told Sasha that he had spoken to Jacobo Zabludovsky about Sasha's questions on U.S. nuclear policy, and that Zabludovsky had just laughed at him for putting such naive, silly questions. Zabludovsky had said that everyone knows of U.S. interest in curbing the spread of nuclear power. Sasha laughed, and said that was only newspaper talk.

Subj expressed concern to Sasha as to why he had been turned over to Valentin Loginov. Sasha repeated his previous statement that Loginov had more opportunity for outside contact, even visits to Subj's office as part of his natural consular duties. Further, the changeover had been ordered by their superiors. Sasha said that Loginov would get in touch with Subj.

3. The C.O. found out that when Subj had mentioned Echevarria to Sasha at an earlier meet as being a seeker for the presidency of Mexico, Sasha had shown great interest.

The C.O. asked Subj if there were any activity on travel to the Soviet Union (for the purpose of discovering if Subj would bring up the name of Maria de la Paz Cervantes, a Sabena airline employee interested in travel to the Soviet Union).

Subj replied that some members of the Jewish community in Mexico were inquiring about a trip to the Soviet Union.

4. Subj is to call in whenever he hears from Loginov about a meet.

Notes: Subj, in anticipation of his housewarming of his new apt, requests that for April (or during April) we procure for him 1 case of Scotch, 1 case of Vermouth, a case of White Wine, and a case of Ped - if it is possible. the C.O. suggests gradual accumulation of this lot over the next two months.

Contact Report/ L/DXX-5
S. Rose, Subj's office, 14 Feb, La Perkola Restaurant 2001

1.  4 Feb the C.O. visited Subj's office briefly to advise him how to handle the next meet with Aleksandr Pukhinski, when the latter had initiated meetings. Particularly, Subj was to give Sasha a "hard time."

2.  10 Feb in a telephonic double-talked conversation Subj advised the C.O. that Sasha had called his office on 9 Feb, asked if he were going to be brushed off further, and insisted on a meet for 11 Feb 0900 breakfast at Sanborns.

The C.O. told Subj to go ahead with the meet, and follow the line of least resistence.

3.  14 Feb Subj reported to the C.O. the results of his meet with Sasha on 11 Feb at Sanborn's Restaurant. Subj found Valentin Leninov, the Soviet Consul, with Sasha. The latter told Subj that since he has little work that takes him outside of the SovEmb, he is turning Subj over to Valentin who will henceforth be Subj's contact. Subj, who had met Valentin once before at the SovEmb, jointly replied that that was all right with him, Valentin was a nice guy-much better than Chula; however, carried the ball for most of the balance of the conversation.

Sasha complained because Subj had not yet brought the answers to his questions. Subj replied by ripping into Sasha in turn with complaints of why he hadn't done the papers, his sickness, his visit to Temple, Texas clinic, the findings of the clinic, his business at the office, etc.

Subj followed this with the burden of his complaints about the Soviets, which was that while he was willing to do services for the Soviets, he was fed up with the "junk" assignments they were handing him; he wants to do what is concrete and important. Sasha started to soothe him in the same old way about how important the little things were, etc., but Subj cut him off. At about this time, Valentin chimed in by saying that he and Sasha just pass along to Subj the tasks they receive from higher up, and that it is up to Subj to tell them if he will or will not accomplish them. Subj agreed to that principle.

Sasha then startled Subj by asking directly why it was that Subj was working for the Soviet Union. Subj answered candidly that he didn't really know why-and said the Soviets knew he was not ideologically with them. Sasha seized on that to say that was just the way the Soviets wanted it- Subj was right not to.

COPIES MADE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 112

show any enthusiasm for the Soviet Union or Communism, etc. Subj continued, however, to state that he felt a comradeship with the Soviets because of their past association during the toughest part of his life when they faced a common enemy (referring to his partisan fighting days against the Germans). He said also that it looks as if the Soviets are going to win us in the future, and he wants to be on the side of the victors.

Sasha then went on to ask Subj to do certain things for him. He would like the answers to the questions at the next meeting. He wanted Subj to check with his friend, Jose Maria Buldain. Why is it that the U.S. is subvertising Mantes's socio-de-nuclearization, and why the U.S. is for control of nuclear power at Laguna Verde? He wanted to find Majalodovsky out on who was building up as candidate for the next President of Mexico. As to the latter, Subj told Sasha and Valentin the story he had already turned in to the Station: Echevarria, of Gobernación, was trying to line up five Jews in the Jewish community of Mexico to support his candidate for the presidency.

Sasha set the next meet for 15 Feb 0900 amin at Senhora Restaurant on Horacacio Fontes, and said that Valentin would not be there because he was going to be in Veracruz on that date.

Subj told the C.G. that some time ago when Sasha agreed to get Cuban cigars for Subj he told Subj that Soviet couriers no longer transit Mexico to Havana, but that they go direct from Moscow.

Subj also mentioned that Pavel Yatskov had booked passage at Subj's office last week for a trip to Ixtatlan and Manzanillo.

5. The C.C. at first played the moot with Sasha set for 15 Feb, and instructed Subj not to bring the answers. Further, he was to throw the Sabludovsky bit right back at Sasha as being too ridiculous to put to a knowing newspaperman what was common knowledge about U.S. policy on nuclearization. Then, in Valentin's absence, Subj was to express concern to Sasha about being given a contact who probably didn't know what the score was on everything that had gone before in Subj's work, etc. Lastly, Subj could mention to Sasha that he was reading the Penkovskiy Papers, and he couldn't see how a Soviet agent could run in Intelligence could turn sour.

After checking with Francis Coyne, it was decided to continue on the track of annoying Sasha and therefore have Subj miss his next meeting. Subj was later apprised of the change in plans, and will not show up on 15 Feb or 16 Feb.

6. Subj advised the C.O. on 15 Feb that Sasha had called to find out why Subj had missed his meet, and put the screws on for 16 Feb. The C.C. told Subj to be no show on 16 Feb. Resignedly reminded to "sand-in" meet.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: AEGELATIN, Jr.

DATE OF MEETING: 16 June 1966

1.  I had lunch with Subject at the Reforma Club from 1330 to 1500 on 16 June 1966.

2.  Subject immediately identified the passport photo of BOYAROV as the "Viktor" he had met on 4 June.

3.  lle said that our picture of LOGINOV was not "Vasilio" whom he described as younger and not as heavy as LOCINOV'S picture.

4.  Subject reported that on 13 June ISAYEV called him at home and asked to come by that evening. (Confirmed by LIENVOY).
    ISAYEV arrived about 1930 and stayed to about 2030. Subject suggested that they have a Martini. ISAYEV said that he had never had one and was interested in the ingredients and how it was put together. However, after he had drunk half, Subject noted that he obviously did not like it. Therefore, Subject offered him a Cuba Libra which he accepted and drank. The result of this combination was the first time Subject has seen ISAYEV a bit tipsy.

5.  ISAYEV said that he had heard that Subject had had a successful weekend fishing 3-5 June. Subject admitted this and then sounded off about how rude YATSKOV had been (drinking Vodka in front of Nick and his friend, refusing to come to Nick's for a drink or inviting Nick and his friend in, anger at Nick's success, etc). ISAYEV merely shrugged this off. Nick then mentioned that he had met the new man "Viktor," (BOYAROV), had spoken a few words of English with him and thought he was very nice. ISAYEV answered that although "Viktor" was not a fisherman, he had enjoydd seeing the Mexican countryside and particularly the scenery at Pucuato. They did not discuss the third Soviet, "Vasilio."

6. ISAYEV asked what his fishing plans were. Nick said that he was so busy with his many problems at the new plant that he would not be going fishing during June. Nick then suggested that they go on the weekend of 1 July. However, he added "but Just you and me. Don't bring any of your friends like that rude Pablo (YATKOV)." ISAYEV answered "Not even Anatoliy (KARABACH?" Nick answered that Anatoliy was okay and he could come. This date is tentative and will be confirmed.

7. ISAYEV remarked zhat his wife and child were in Cuernavaca and that KARABACH's wife would go down on the weekend of 18 June leaving them both bachelors. Nick facetiously remarked that he would have to organize some wome: for them.

8. Nick asked ISAYEV about the Soviet volleyball team. ISAYEV said that he had been heavily engaged in working with them. He was with the team for each game, then went out with them to dinner, took them to the hotel, etc. and didn't get home nights until 1am.

9. Nick brought up the point that ISAYEV had never invited him to his house. ISAYEV, definitely uncomfortable and searching for words, said that he hadn't invited them because his wife thought that there was too big a contrast between Nick's home and theirs. That Nick was "rich" with lots of beautiful things that they lived very modestly having inherited undistinguished furniture from his predecessor, etc. Nick pooh-poohed this stating that friendship is what counts and the circumstances of one's home meant nothing. ISAYEV ended by saying rather gamely that he would invite Nick to his home. Nick said that from ISAYEV's. words and discomfiture, it was obvious that he is ashamed to invite anyone to his house.

10. Finally, Nick said that it was his impression that ISAYEV had absolutely no immediate plans to return to the USSR and Nick feels that he will be here until November or December.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: Nick KOURCHENKO, Jr.

DATE OF MEETING: 7 June 1966

1. I met Nick at his apartment from 2030 to 2200 in order to debrief him on the fishing weekend of 3-5 June.

2. Nick reported that when he and his Mexican friend arrived at Pucuato at 1845 on Friday, 3 June, YATSKOV and two other Soviets were already there fishing in front of the cabins. They had come in ISAYEV's VW. Shortly thereafter the Soviets came to the cabins and Nick grected YATSKOV and introduced his Mexican friend to him. YATSKOV did not introduce the other two Soviets by name but they all did shake hands. Nick invited them all into his room but only YATSKOV came. He accepted a drink and left with it. Later outside Nick asked one of the new Soviets his name and got the answer, "Vasilio." The other one then used an English word and Nick asked if he spoke English. This Soviet said his name was Viktor and that he spoke a little English. Nick then asked YATSKOV which of the other two was the newly arrived Soviet. YATSKOV said that it was Viktor. Nick then lent them his extra lantern and that ended things for the night.

3. The next day both groups fished separately at Sabanita. About noon YATSKOV came by and noticed that Nick was having luck so he brought the other two Sovs to a spot immediately adjacent. They stayed about an hour, didn't have any luck and left. They met again that evening at the cabins. Nick and his friend had caught 28 trout and the Soviets none. YATSKOV was upset, jealous and even angry. Nick then invited Viktor in for a drink. Viktor did the same as YATSKOV, took the drink with him. YATSKOV said that the Soviets would leave Sunday morning since they had no luck. Nick left early Sunday morning for fishing. He later learned from the owner that the Soviets had left fairly early Sunday morning.

4. Although all the Soviets were pleasant and correct there was absolutely no socializing or extended conversation. They did not accept Nick's invitations to come in for a drink, except for the above noted occasions when they accepted a drink and left taking it with them.

5. "Viktor:" Nick described him as an older man, 36 to 42, medium height, 82-85 kilos, heavy but not fat build, roundish, boyish face, looked like an American in general appearance. Does not speak Spanish. Said he spoke a little English. However, their conversation was so limited that Nick couldn't determine his fluency. He obviously understood everything that Nick said but his answers and comments were short and simple. As noted above, YATSKOV said that he is the newly arrived Soviet. He did not do any fishing himself but simply watched YATSKOV and the othor Soviet.

6. I showed Nick a picture of BOYAROV. Nick couldn't positively identify it. Our picture has sunglasses. During the day Viktor had on a white towel protecting his neck and a wide hat but no sunglasses. At night Nick saw very little of him and it was dark. However, Nick did say that our photo was not at all incompatible with Viktor. Also showed him a photo of GAZIYEV and he said that this was definitely not Viktor. (COMMENT: Since GAZIYEV and BOYAROV are the only new Soviets in town, and Viktor spoke English, he has to be BOYAROV. But why did he use the name Viktor when his name is Vitaliy?'

7. "Vasilio": About 28-32 years old, medium to dark blond curly hair, medium height, very good athletic build, tough and strong appearance, the all-American boy type. Speaks pretty good Spanish but not as well as ISAYEV or YATSKOV. There are only two Vasiliys at the Embassy, BUTSEV and MIROSHNIKOV, but neither comes any where near the above description. (COMMENT: Nick's description of"Vasilio" fits LOGINOV to a. "T." However, his name is Valentin and not Sasiliy. I will show Nick pictures at the next meeting.)

8 Previously Nick has met 8 Soviets, all in true name (mostly by first name only). Thus it is strange that BOYAROV and LOGINOV should use phony names..

# Contact Report of 3 June 66
Source: LI/COUL-11

In the contact report of 12 April, Subject reported that LOGINOV had visited his stone during the evening of 6 April and made a long distance phone call to Cuernavaca. At our meeting on 1 June he produced the phone bill with the phone number on it. According to the bill, the call was made to phone number 2-50-65 which agrees with the number given to us by Subject in April. Mike E. checked this number and found it listed to:

Moises Gamero de la Fuente
Callejon H. Preciado Numero 4
Cuernavaca, Mor.

We have no traces of this man and are not sure that LOGINOV talked to him since people often leave a phone in someone else's name. LOGINOV talked for 3 and a half minutes on 6 April.

SUBJECT: Contact Report/LICOZY-5 file: P-2712 12 May 1966
11 May 1200, Subj's office

1. By telephone an attempt was made to line Subj up for an LCFLUTTER. But the time Subj was able to allot for "meeting the representative from Washington" was too limited for the operator, and thus the examination was postponed to some later date.

The C.O. wants to go on record, in any event, for believing that the timing was not appropriate for subjecting Subj to the LCFLUTTER. Subj had been led over a period of months up to the point where he carried out a break-off from the Soviets re clandestine work for them. Just the same day he had been scheduled for the examination, 3 May, he had a scene with his old Soviet case officer, Prikhodko, and no matter what aplomb Subj has (and he has plenty) Subj finds the break-off scenes emotionally wearing. Hence, to have sprung an LCFLUTTER on him at this time, he may have been inordinately sensitive to a feeling that we distrusted him - coming as it did after our adamant stand that he cut loose from the Soviets. The risk of affronting Subj by an LCFLUTTER was not, in the C.O.'s opinion, worth it at this particular stage of relationships in the operation.

2. On 11 May Subj reported that on 10 May at about 1630 Valentin Loginov came to his office. Loginov asked Subj if he knew anything about the Congress of Intellectuals that was going to take place in Mexico. Loginov said that the Congress, whose topic was Anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, was really anti-Soviet. He brought Subj a pamphlet in Spanish "The Jews in the Soviet Union" (printed by the Soviet Embassy in Mexico) - (attached). Subj did some fast thinking, because he in reality had booked the hotel reservations for the group that was to attend the Congress. He told Loginov that he had handled the hotel reservations at the Hotel Del Prado. When Loginov asked for the names of the delegates, Subj said he didn't know them.

Earlier that day Subj had seen Israeli Amb Arad, and the Congress had been a topic of discussion between them. Arad had said that some news media, specifically El Dia, Política, and Siempre, had criticised the Congress as being anti-Soviet. The Israeli Embassy actually was supporting the Congress, but for policy reasons, had to remain in the background. An Israeli, named Tov, was in Mexico promoting the Congress, but he was not associated with the Israeli Embassy. Arad feared there might be leftist interruption of the Congress, scheduled to take place at

Arad told Subj that eight persons had come to Mexico, brought be the Sovieta, He didn't know where they came from or who they were. Arad was happy that some newspapers were defending the Congress.
After Loginov's visit Subj called Arad to advise him of the Soviet's interest in the Congress. Subj said that Arad would be dining at his hone that evening (11 May).
3. Loginov also told Subs that he had been in Veracruz because of the seaman that had jumped ship there. He said that he had found the seaman, and returned hin to his ship. There had been a fight aboard ship, the seaman who fled had flod-had hit a companion with a bottle and thought he he had killed him. The can had not been killed.
4. Sudj said he would be going to New York for five daya on 15 May. He stays at the St. Regia Hotel.

SUBJECT: Ernst GOEBEL

1. On 2 May 1966 Subject called me and asked for a meeting which took place at his office from 1530 to 1600 the same day.

2. Subject reported that on Saturday, 16 April he saw LOGINOV with his wife and son leaving the French Club at ca 1500. He noticed that another car, 25 DA (GORLITSYN's) was parked next to LOGINOV's. A half an hour later 25 DA was still there, which meant that its owner had something to do with the Club Independent of LOGINOV. I showed Subject pictures of GORLITSYN which he Immediately Identified as the Soviet who was with LOGINOV the first time Subject saw him at the Club, (comment: Since this makes two times that GORLITSYN has been at the Club, perhaps he is also a member.)

3. Subject reported that on Sunday, 24 April he and another member, Antonio SARMIENTO, were looking for a fourth to play doubles. Subject noticed LOGINOV standing beside the tennis court and asked SARMIENTO to Invite LOGINOV to join them. However, LOGINOV declined and sald that he was going to have a swim with SARMIENTO's wife, After lunch Subject saw LOGINOV and SARMIENTO playing chess together and overheard that they are on a first-name basis. From the above Subject commented that LOGINOV and the SARMIENTOS have a close social relationship.

4. Subject knows SARMIENTO casually as an occaslonal tennis companion. SARMIENTO owns a plastic factory which makes airline bags and similar Items. He is about 35. His wife's name is Violeta and she is In her late 208. Subject looked them up in the phone book and got the following listing: Violeta SARMIENTO, Manuel M. Ponce 143, Guadalupe Inn, tel: 24-21-58.

5. We have several LIFEAT traces on the SARMIENTOS in social contact with NECHIPORENKO at the French Club. Evidently LOGINOV took them over from him.

6. Now that Subject has found a link, I told him to try to engage LOGINOV In conversation, have a drink with him. etc. In order to establish a direct line to him.

AAV representatives Ibarquien and Romero were also on hand. *Boichenko* was much put out because their arrival had been delayed over the matter of obtaining Mexican visas.

The others would remain in Mexico for the conference.

2. The delegates were taken to the Hotel Reforma. Subj, who brought Lev Likhailov to the Reforma, asked how it was that Mikhailov had left the Foreign Office to be in INTURIST. Mikhailov said he had a 15 year old daughter, in Moscow, and wanted to remain there. His card read, "Director of International Organizations", INTURIST.

3. Subj had coffee at the airport with Valentin L. Ivanov and Visko. Nothing was said of Subj's break-off from Lorinov.

1.  When the C.C. arrived at Suoja office, one of the male employees of Sudj evidently advised him that Mr. Ferrer" was here. Sub came from his inner office to advice the C.C. that (leonid Railyevich) Witforor was in his office making travel arrangements. fame C.D. remained in the outer office, but with his back to the passageway and his face Furied led in a carazine

Subdoquently, Subj told the C.O. that miriforos Iraving for vacation to the Soviet Union on 21 Arr via Air France. He was due to return to Mexico on 24. Kay.

Subj also mentioned that the IRIS TRIST delegation coming to the AAV mooting in Guadalajara (27-30 Apr) had not arrived in Mexico as scheduled (on 19 Apr) because there had boon à delay in their receiving Mexican visas. The delay was occasioned by Mexican demand for minimal bioraphic information in order to process the visas. The group of four has been ro-scheduled to arrive in Moxico on 23 Apr via Sabeña.

The C.O. now the exchange of telorrana re the information required for visa issuance, and notedth the following:

Viktor Jolchenko, born 21 July 1925 in Aktjuhinak; president of INTURIST; Passport D01155 B, issued 6 Oct 1965.

Lev Cihailov, born 11 May 1924 in Moscow; chief of the International Department; Papaport C 065257, issued 25 Sept 1965.

Assan Ahmedov (sic), born 24 June 1924 in Tashkent; chief of the Usbekistan. Tourion Directorate; Развport 069757, issued 24 Dec 1965.

Lyudmil Kuzetoova, born 5 Mar 1923 in Moscow; Latin American Department; Passport C:065784, issued 6 Oct 1965.

Subj mentioned that at the Copenhagen Congress on Congress Organizations that he attended 30 ar to 2 Apr 1966, he met two Soviet "scientists" and the INFURIST rop for Denmark. The "representatives from the Academy of Sciences" were Gennadiyi Andreyevich Mozhaev and Timur T. Timofciev (cards attached).

2.  The C. who had heard from Subjon 19 Apr by telephone that he had had his confrontation with Valentin Lecinov last week requested a full account of that meeting. Subj reported that Loginor had called him on 15 apr requesting a meet somewhere outside; Subj insisted that Loginov come to his office.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

2. 
The following day, 14 Apr, Loginov came to Subj's office. He asked Subj how his trip (to Europe) had been and specifically asked if Subj had seen Ginette Palacel Porter. Subj replied that he had found out that Ginette and her husband were vacationing in Italy.

Loginov asked what impressions Subj had received in Europe on France's backing out of NATO. Subj answered that he had spoken to some Frenchmen, including George Laguere of Air France, who considered in general that de Gaulle was not wrong, but that his way was too drastic, that he was annoying everyone, and that France could not be isolated.

Then Subj made his break-off announcement to Loginov, saying Dut- I'm sorry to telly you that I'm not going to be able to work with you any more. There are several reasons. Loginov asked if anything had happened. Subj replied he had reasons. Loginov asked what they were. Subj said he was tired; he had a lot to do; and frankly he was plain disappointed- there had been big deals planned, nothing happened, and he was doing just junk. Loginov asked if that was Subj's final decision. Subj said yes. The Soviet then asked if they could talk it over. Subj said certainly, any time. Thereupon it was agreed between them that they would meet half an hour before the expected arrival at Mexico Airport of the INTURIST group coming to Mexico. They would meet in the restaurant.

Subj told Loginov ho had traveled with Amb Dazarov, and that they had become very friendly. And he asked Loginov if he minded that he saw the Amb again. Loginov said not at all- but not to call the Amb at the SovEmb or use the phone for any calls to the SovEmb.

As stated in para. 1 above, the INTURIST delegation did not arrive on 19 Apr, and Subj who knew of the postponement did not go to the airport, and consequently missed his meet with Loginov.

3. Subj, in his customary way asked "did I do right?" The C.O. said it was fine if Loginov got the no-nonsense idea that Subj was through. The C.O. told Subj to wait until the Sovs get in touch with him again, and to have their second meet, at which Subj again makes perfectly clear that he is through. Ho is to remain friendly though, and is free to do anything he wishes re establishing contact with the Soviet Ambassador. Subj said he would under any circumstances postpone his meet with Loginov until at least the night of 23 Apr when the INTURIST delegation is scheduled to arrive.

Some time ago subject's radio was stolen from his home. He reported it to the police and nothing happened. He has continued te request police assistance in this matter, until the robbery and subject's complaining about lack of police attention was brought to the attention of Gen. OJETO, who assigned, or requested that an agent be assigned to go out and calm down the irate Soviet. The agent went out on 19 July, last.

On 20 July, last, the agent reported back to Gen. COETO that he had talked to subject for some time about the stolen radio, but that following the discussion the subject had asked the agent "to work for him on certain matters", offering him 5,000.00 pesos per month. Agent requested instructions. Gen. COETO contacted L/S, discussed the matter and told the agent to accept the offer. Agent again saw subject on 21 July, last, and was given his first "assignment" by subject.

This was a request for agent to locate one NICOLAS JUAN BOSTROEN and latter's wife, VALENTINA GRUSDOW DE BOSTROEN, both described as Venesuelan citizens, and to advise subject soonest as to street address and telephone number of residence, as well as place of employment

1. At 08:00 hours I had a telephone call from the Secretary of Gobernacion, Lic. Luis Echevarria. He said that he had an urgent matter in which he needed my help. He added that this was a matter that President Gustavo Diaz Ordas, was personally very interested.

2. Echevarria sent Lienvoy/2 to see me and gave me the following information and asked the following help of me.

a). President Diaz Ordas is personally very "upset" by certain recent actions by some Soviets in Mexico. (Note: I believe, but do not know this, that some Soviet has tried to "recruit" a source close to the President and that this has "cackfired").

b). Valentin JACUINOV, Soviet (Fown KGB) is of particular and urgent interest tothe President. I was told by Echevarria on the telephone that the top name on the list he would send by Lienvov/2 would probably get the same treatment that some others get in 1959". This refers to PNG actions taken in March 1959 against two, Soviets caught with Demetrio VALLEJO Partirez and the Ballrrad Strikers. I was asked if I could send tim things to Echevarria urgently: These are: A Summary of data in JACUINOV, particularly saying what there was to show him a "Spy"; and, secondly, a list of know Spies in the Soviet Embassy. (Note: These requests were given to me orel-Ev and on a card by Lienvoy/2, when I saw him at 08:40 hours on 22 July 1966).

c). Data on two "Trouble Makers": Felix ALVAHUANTE and Lenin ALVAHUANTE. These two, are incon and a file resume will bir made and sent to Echevarria. This request was sent by a card from Echevarria which Lienvoy/2 gave me.

3. I asked Echevarria for his personal assistance in getting the data on Soviets whichithe lexican Foreton office has. I told him that this data, with photographs particularly, would help us. He promised to get this data for us; and Trinters to push for it on a continuing basis.

o' meetings with Subject on 11 and
aed from 1630 to about 1700 hours.
introduced Francis J. COIGNE to Subject as
the next meeting was set for Wednesday 27 July
at the corner of Puebla and Jalan streets
Subject claimed that he had relatives in town
and told to keep his notes up to date. He had very little
to add and was instructed to make every effort
to keep his notes on a daily basis. During the meeting on
Subject rejected that I was leaving and that Pablo
would be acting his in the future. Subject said absolutely
to stop and continue talking about another topic. I was not
sure he had understood me and repeated that I was leaving
He said that he understood. My impression was
that I was leaving and his reaction to my bit of
surprise was totally unexpected. (or rather his lack of reaction).
I did not note that when Subject enters the car he begins talking
in what I felt like a very strange way to begin any kind of
conversation. I felt that he might be repeating a prepared
statement. Once or twice I asked him the same question in
different ways to see if he would give me the answer in the
form he originally but he always changed it enough so
I was assured that he was telling me something in his own
way. Nevertheless, it was a point that always bothered me
and I wanted to make it a matter of record.

(From his written notes)

Saturday, 24 June. Subject saw the short American woman (previously
seen near the rhoning room Subject's store to a tourist agency)
leaving the Soviet Embassy about 1130 hours. He did not see
her enter. She came into the shop to use Subject's phone but the
phone is out of order. About the same time he saw two men who
he felt to be Americans enter the Embassy. One was white and
the other a negro. Subject went to pick up some bottles and
heard them speak to each other in English. According to Subject,
SILNIKOV told him that two Americans had visited the Embassy
to obtain visas because they did not want to fight in Viet Nam.
(We have not been able to identify the woman but the Americans
are probably LICOSI. said they left the Embassy at 1157 hours.)
They apparently made two visits to the Embassy. Once in the
morning and once in the early afternoon.
Subject states that SILNIKOV told him that they wanted VISAS.
It is not clear how SILNIKOV knew anything about these
matters. ROOTORINOV is no longer on the main gate of the
Embassy.

Sunday 25 June. SILNIKOV dropped by (and made the comments
above). He also told: Subject that Viktor KALYGIN had been
placed on the main gate once more (confirmed by the basehouses)
and that he (SIL) was: "officially" the administrative officer.
He said he can now find time to eat Mexican food without a subject
and said he would be by the following day about 0900 hours.

Sunday, 25 June. SILNIKOV came in about 0900 hours and
Carmen Alita, Carmen Alita, fixed him some special Mexican food
for her Saintina's Day. He was there for about a half
hour. Valentin Loginov came in and ordered 75 pesos worth
of stamps to be delivered that same day by 15000
pesos and at 1900 hours Loginov
returned with three more cases of co.c. "the
invitation is already there" and asked Subject
to apply directly to the Embassy. On his arrival at
the Embassy he noted that there were groups from all the
Communist states and that each had brought wine and food
representative of their country. There was so much food and

Paul:

1.  I have reviewed the entire LOGINOV file and have made copies of all pertinent LIENVOY clips for the following P files and have included a note to that effect in each of these files:

Miriam AVILA Katz P-581
Socorro FLORES P-12259
Salvador PAZ Plata 12775
Erika KAMMERMAN P-12843

2.  Attached hereto are copies of all the clips I found on the other people included on the list you gave me.

a. Besides the 11 April clip on Dr. Juan Luis ALVAREZ Gallou I found a 12 Jul 66 call from Jose Luis ALVAREZ Gayou, probably at least related if not the same person. This is the only name on which other there are any/possibly identifiable traces:

(1) According to a 28 June 1961 LITEA Contact Feport,

Jose Luis ALVAREZ was one of the students in the Tuesday and Thursday, 7 to 8:30 p. m., Russian language classes at the IICMR during the months of February and March.

(2) H-6018, dated 17 November 1961, based on information from LIENVOY Unit C, reported that one Jose Luis ALVAREZ was a member of the MLN Committee of Michoacan.

(3) In a 30 November 1961 Legal Attache report one Jose Luis ALVAREZ of Morelia, Michoacan, was named as one who assisted the National Liberation Movement in Nexico.

(4) HNMA-20810, dated 1 March 1963, included the following information from LIBRIFORM: "One Jose Luis ALVAREZ (matronymic unknown) is putting items in the 'Voa de la Universidad'! (Universidad Autonora Nacional de Mexico) for the Czechs. KUBATA, the Charge d'Affaires in the Czech Embassy praised ALVAREZ for his reports and said 'we will give you money and material to help support the magazine'. ALVAREZ also works on the University's 'Feriodico de la Universidad' (newspaper).

(5) HA-27516, dated 27-October 1965, provided an 11- October 1965 listing, again based on LIENVCY information, on


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 140

which the name of Jose Luis ALVAREZ was again included as an active member of the MLN and a member of the State Committee of Morelia, Michoacan, which had its general offices at Guillermo Prieto 35-10 in Morelia.

b. About Gloria ALFARO, I wonder if she may not be related to Ofelia ALFARO Lopez (P-11339) / friend of Antonio SARMIENTO (P-12703) teacher at the UNAM Economics School and his wife, Violeta. Both Ofelia ALFARO and LOGINOV attended a Christmas party at the SARMIENTO's last year (pertinent clips included with the Gloria ALFARO material attached). In the 22 June 66 conversation Gloria ALFARO had with LOGINOV she mentions having met him at Christmas time.

c. Copies of all of LOGINOV's contacts with the Instituto de-Interpretes-y-Traductores, including the one which mentioned are attached.

Senorita HARNANDEZ Other people connected with that outfit are:

Lio KELSIN
Sarita Inu
Jacobo Chensinski

3. Besides the names on your list I also found two clips on Margaret (Magre) FEDOR who seems to be on quite familiar terms with LOGINOV. I have included copies of them also.

4. Note that all of the calls in question are incoming calls. Also to each of these people something is mentioned about classes.

## SUBJECT: Contact Report/ LICCEY-5
25 June 1150-1215, Subj's office

26 June 1965

1. In response to a call-in by Subj, the C.O. went to see Subj on Saturday morning 25 June.

2. Subj reported that Valentin Loginov had dropped in to the office on 24 June to make arrangements for a return trip to the Soviet Union for (Nicolai) Leonov; who, Loginov said, had to be in Moscow at the latest 4 July. Subj said he would try to handle. /Comments: Loginov said he would come by the office on 27 June with Leonov's passport, because there was the likelihood that Subj would attempt to get a KLM flight for Leonov via Houston (requiring a U.S. visa for Leonov). In any event, Subj told the C.O. that he was not going to the U.S. Embassy to request the visa, but would buck the whole problem to KLM who would have to make any visa arrangements that were required/.

3. Interestingly enough, Loginov took the opportunity to bring up operational matters again to Subj, and Subj used the ensuing discussion to make his stance utterly clear to Loginov. The conversation went more or less as follows:

Loginov said: "You're mad at me." Subj said: "Why should I be mad at you?"

Loginov said: "Because of Majestic" (referring to the fact that the Sovs had first given a travel request to Viajes Majestic to be serviced). You know we have to spread it around among friends." Subj shrugged this off. Then Loginov asked: "Are you still mad?"

Subj replied: "I'm not mad, and I never was. Look, Valentin-" (and then he made his first attempt at clarification, saying in effect that in normal friendly matters they were like brothers; Subj exaggerated as is his manner- mentioning intimate matters like "marriage" and "even unto death(hasta la muerte)" but saying that that was the culmination point- "anything else" was finished).

Loginov said (without batting an eye): "I had some business for you."

Subj cut him short: "Don't bring me anything- important or not important- you can keep it. You want to go for coffee; you want to go out with girls; - with much pleasure; anything up to that point. And I want you to understand that clearly. Don't force me; and let's be good friends." Loginov said: "You're getting difficult."

Subj replied: "No, I'm not difficult. And there's no damage. I made my decision - and your chiefs will understand my position."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 144

2. 
Loginov tried again: "A good friend of yours was appointed Chief of the U.S. Travel Service - Paul Giedre- he's a friend of yours?"

Subj became a little heated in reply: "Yes, he's a good friend. I will always be close to him. But you got this very clear- any plans you have for Paul Cicaro, forget about them, is that clear? I won't do a godden thing. I hope you understand that. We're friends (you and I), but beside being friends- period!"

Loginov took out a piece of paper and started to read from it, asking Subj if he knew the man "Eduardo Vetelzen-approximately 55 years old- a Mexican Jes." (Attached is a photocopy of the piece of paper Loginov had been reading, and which he left behind on Subj's desk apparently by mistake. It's in Russian, and Subj was not able to translate completely at first glance. Subj plans to return the original to Loginov when he comes by on 27 June.) While Loginov was reading, Subj said insistently: "I don't know the man, and I'm not going to do anything..." Loginov replied: "I'm not acking you to do anything - it's just that I don't know (about him). About Paul Giedro, he's a good friend of yours..."

Subj said: "Forgot it."

4. Subj asked the C.O. - "did I do wrong?" The C.O. replied that Subj had done beautifully- but he has to expect that the Sovs will keep up all kinds of pressures subtle, small, or even great, and not so subtle. But the way is clear- all he has to do is say "no."

Subj said that Loginov had brought him a box of "Punch" cigars (Cuban), and Subs as usual offered to pay, but Loginov pressed them on him. Subj then said to the C.O. he wanted an expression of policy on how he should handle that kind of thing from the Sovs- take the gifts, after offering to pay? refuse outright? The C.0. said we would give the guidance he needed for that situation.

5. The C.0. will drop around to Subj's office early next week.

Addendum: the C.O. told Subj that there was a rumor that Oleg Nechiporenko was seen around town. Subj said he knew of nothing on that score, but doubted it strongly- since he was sure Oleg would have contacted him. The C.O. under- scored that Subj do nothing about the rumor.

25 July 1966

1.  Subj reported that a Valentin Compahey had dropped in at his office on 20 July. (Loginov had another companion in the office too). Loginov told Subject that ho had received a telegram from partly risey to Subj- that "they" were very disappointed, because they had ridden Subj, and they had hopes that Subj would cooperate. Subj answered (in what must sound like a broken record by now) that he still was a friend to the Soviets, that he was on their side, he was their man - but he can't do anything for them. He heard they wouldn't try to force him- because he-just can't do anything for them.

Loginov started to give up: he told Subj that Pavel Yatskov was leaving for Moscow on 4 August (he was in Subj's office to make the arrangements)- and would be returning in a month. He asked what word Yatskov can bring back to Moscow. Subj said he had already told him: nothing- he can't do anything for them. Loginov then nuked about Yatskov would being back to Subj- and Subj said not a thing. He jokingly asked Loginov if they old bring "Tazara" (a Soviet actress who had attended one of the ings (of the Soviets) that would be fine with him. Loginov appreciated the joke, and parted from Subj cordially.

/Comment: Loginov did not ask for the piece of paper he had left in Subj's office - re some and he had started to inquire about, and Subj left it at that- he didn't bring the subject, although he has the piece of paper to return to Loginov/.

2.  In response to the C.G.'s inquiry Subj mentioned the names of some applicants for travel to the Soviet Union.

Apparently the - phology Cur ress to take place in Moscow in August 1966

Loginov had reported several applicants to Subj's offices: Juliet Fernandez de Ochen and her sister(Dr. Fernandez' card attached) and two friends. Dr. Fernandez made inquiries about travel arrangements. She has not come back yet.

Licenciate Luciano Lora had come to the office (?) on 21 July to arrange travel to the Soviet Union. Subj said that his employee, Kirian Avila Katz, who handles important matters, had told him that Lemah had been invited by the Soviet Ambassador and also that he was a close friend to the Mexican Amb to Koscom.

The Montfort Travel Agency in Tijuana had transferred a request to Subj to handle the travel to the Soviet Union as tourists for two "Señoras": Maria Jesus de Abakian and Estela Castro.

/Comment: the C.G. told Subj we wanted more info about these applicants/


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

3. The C.0. reminded Subj that we would like additional information about the individuals who had left to attend the Microbiological Congress in Moscow. The C.0. suggested that Subj have screens in his office extract from the folder Subj has all extra information that can be adduced; such as, address, age, profession, etc. Subj said he would try to have it done before he leaves on his trip (on 31 July).

4. Subj asked if there was anything new about "Herb" (Gestetner). The C.0. said he had word from Washington about the ground rules in case he (Subj) were to go to Santiago de Chile. What he does about seeing Herb is his own affair - but if he does see Herb Subj is to omit reference to our "business" in Mexico as far as volunteering information is concerned. That Herb does vis a vis Subj is Herb's business.

5. The C.O. will got to see Subj before he leaved for Europe on 31 July.

In discussing LOGINOV with LWRAND you might wish to point out that the reason he can devote 85% of his time to intelligence work is that there are 3568 Consuls but no consular work:

*   4 hours a week office hours
*   average 8 wives a month.
*   USSR has less consular work in them than any other major country, most minor ones
*   Consular work could be handled by 1/3 of the time of the most junior officer
*   etc

He told her that he would take care of everything if she wanted to go to his country (USSR). I went outside the door of the store in order to afford him more liberty.men he finished talking, he wanted to justify himself to co by saying that he is a batchelor because his wife is in Oehavica.

Sunday, 21 August 1935

Today everything is normal since I know that my friends won't come on house to eat. I had made my program for today, Sunday, that is to say to leave, to take my wife and grand- child to the country and eat outside the house.

But at 1530, which is the hour to close, my wife and grandchild were already there. Then SILNIKOV arrived to drink a beer. De was fooling pretty bad from last night's "drinking bout" at the feste celebrating the Ambassador's return. He told me that they were drinking all night. But at this time it was raining quite hard so that I couldn't close up and leave the store. My wife asked him why he had always thought differently (sic) in not coming to eat at our house. And on the moment he said that he would come. My wife shot me a questioning look and finally SILNIKOV broke the silence saying; "whic here, I will be back in a minute". Then he left in the rain which had baied a little. It then started to rain harder and a ser left the Babassy driven by the Ambassador Sr. Viktor (STRYZHEV), He didn't park in front of the store but in Gelati, the street running parallel to the store. Then SILNIKOV came in to tell me he was ready. We shut up the store, got into the car and drove to my house. We parked the car in the street and entered my house.... Once inside the first thing they did was to inspect the house in great detail even the "azotea". I think that the house pleased them. They made me show them everything including the bathroom and bedrooms. Then we sat at the table to drink tequila (la copa) and Seer. My wife served barbecued chicken, una sopa, and a guisado which they ate with relish, os so it seemed to me since they ate everything served them accompanied by pleasant chatter. But he didn't even mention

4. I asked Subject if he had mentioned SILNIKOV's pornographic negative to the latter. At first Subject said no, then yes; that he had asked Silnikov about it but Silnikov said that the negative didn't belong to him but to Vasiliy who took it back to Moscow with him. Subject added that Vasiliy had returned to the USSR about two weeks ago. (Comment: This is most probably BUTSEV whom Subject calls Vasiliy and who returned to the USSR on 24 July.) (Second Comment: This is another example of one of Silnikov's vulnerabilities evaporating into thin air).

5. Concerning the item in the notes for Saturday, 30 July, in which Silnikov hid in the ballroom for twenty minutes because two other Soviets came in, Subject had the following to say about these two Soviets:

a. Valentin (El Torro), then follows a perfect description of LOGINOV.

b. Vladimir: here follows a good description of KORMUSHKIN including the fact that he replaced KOSTIKOV, O ly KORMUSHKING name is Vladislav, not Vladimir.

6. I asked Subject about the discrepancy in the 19 July meeting when he said that SILNIKOV and PRASHCHIKIN had come to the store on Saturday 16 July but his notes said that PRASHCHIKIN and his replacement had come. Subject said that he doesn't know who PRASHCHIKIN's replacement is. He also couldn't explain the discrepancy, stating that he couldn't remember the incident now.

7. I also asked him about his item of 21 July in which at the request of VALENTIN he had delivered two cases of refrescos to General Cano 32. (We have no Soviets at this address). He changed it to General Leon 38 (MIKITIN'e home and the film office). The VALENTIN noted above LOGINOV. When Subject delivered the two cases only a Soviet woman was at home. He described this address as a single house which is undergoing renovation inside.

8. In discussing SILNIKOV's recent work fixing up the Embassy I asked who actually did the work. Subject said that the Soviets do not like to deal with established firms for repairs to the Embassy because they charge too much. They prefer to deal with small independent people whom they can beat down on the price. Subject knows of two such individuals:

MEMO FOR RECORD

11 Aug 66

in his monthly report for August 1966, LICALLA said YATSKOV seem ed to have taken PRIKHODKO's place. When I asked why he thought that, he answered:

PRIKHODKO is not here (he left 28 June on home leave). PRIKHODKO had been entering the Fmaray through the main door and was seen working in window # 22. Now YATSKOV is entering through the main door and was seen working at this window. YATSKOV also had the same contact with NIKIFOROV which PRIKHODKO had previously had. Now that YATSKOV has also left (4 Aug), LICALLA thinks that LOGINOV is probably taking his place. (This last statement is not clear; whether LOGINOV is taking YATSKOV's place in ATSKOV's old job, which would be most logical. Or whether LICALLA thinks LOGINOV may now be in the PRIKHODKO job. In any case, PRIKHODKO himself should be back momentarily.)

Re Licenciaio Luciano Large dropped into Subj's office 28 July (?) and was very officious. Then Subj did not have confirmed travel to Satellite countries (including Rumania and Czechoslovakia) ready, Lara fussed and said he would go to Moscow and take his arrangements from there. Plans stay in Moscow a month. Hus free ticket on Apronives Mexico to Madrid. Subj booked him for travel from Madrid to Moscow, via Amsterdam, and return.

Valentin Loginov ad dropped in to Subj's office on 27 July but Subj was too busy to see him. Kanov called Subj on 28 July and made an appointrent to see Subj at 1200 on 29 July at the Fler de Mexico Restaurant near Subj's offico.

The C.O. atresoud to Subj that he continue to play the same tune with Loginov of friends, yea-work, no.

2.  On 30 July the Dove saw Subj briefly in his office; Subj's wife had accompanied him to the office because she will be keeping it while Subj is away on his Eurppien trip starting 30 July, optreire to Subj, his wife is not witting of the C.O. except as a friend of hers. with the wife Esther, arround, Subj was able to manage only a brief account of his meet with Loginov on 29 July. The expected power play by Loginov did not take place he met with Subj just to confirm Pavel Yatskov's travel arrengelonta ans ask Subj again if they could bring Subj Cantthing from Moscow. Hatcher dropped in to the Flor de Mexico too, contributed nothing to the conversation. Subj said he didn't want anything from Moscow (he had given Prikhodko fifty Pollars to bring him back two kilos of caviar).

For the promised additional information on the group who were going to the Microbiological Congress in Hosen (see previous Contact Report for complete list), Subj turned over to the C.O. the attached list which gives only telephone numbers of the professionals going to the Congress, and in some cases the positions.

The C.O. told Esther that he might drop in to the office, if he could do anything for Her. Note: Subj not due back until the end of August.

LICOWL Notes

30 July 1966

27 July 1966

CONTACT REPORT: ORONSKY

SUBJECT: LICOWL-1

1. I met ICOWL-1 on 27 July at 1930 hours (COIGNE was sick).
   The meeting lasted until 2015 hours and I set the next meeting for COIGNE for the same thing and location Wednesday, 10 August. Tell (COIGNE) he will owe LICOWL-1 $800 pesos for salary for the month of July and at the end of August he will owe him another 800 pesos for August. I always pay him at the end of the month.

2. I returned over two audio microphones and I gave them to Feldmann. The microphones were installed in his shop and we have taken the recorder out. The brown paper attached was found in LICOWL's notes (written) for the 25th of June. He said he did not recall how it had gotten there and did not know who had written and drawn on the paper - it's very odd since the word written on the piece of brown paper and the last entry in LICOWL's notes are the same - but the handwriting is definitely different. Only LICOWL should have access to his notes.

LICOWL's written notes from 27 July meeting (translated by WEENING:

Wednesday, 20 July: Today my friend Estanislao (SILNIKOV) came to drink a Recate at about 11 am, and I asked him about the photographs which he had told me he wanted me to make from a negative which he has.
He answered that he was going to look for the negative and bring it to me.
Then he told me that another one of his friends (i. e. Soviets) was leaving on 24 July and now it was Vasiliy's turn (BUTSEV did leave on 24 July), since he has about 9 years old and now it is time to teach him how to be a comrade, "...since for thoseof us who live in a free country, this life of this people seems bad to us because everything is different from what we do. They teach us to love our Progress (?), to live well with our neighbors, to help the poor, to give food to beggers. While they come to our country to create disorder and create distance within our families and in our work, and they infiltrate themselves everywhere in order to sow hatred. They show us everything which is produced in their country and how much they have. But they import things from our countries through their embassies. Daily, their sedition movements can be seen. In fact, a month ago a group of Mexicans (in name) obtained visas for Moscow and in the (Soviet) Embassy they were given a "blast" with as much vodka as they could drink. A good start in getting to know the country which so "foolishly" hopes to improve its mentally backward who cannot realize the evil they do in supporting those who sow desolation wherever they go. After seeing people come every day to the Embassy to get propaganda we can only think that their work is (valid).

Thursday, 21 July: Today at 1045 Sr. Valentin (LOGINOV or. KUCHEROV) came in to use the telephone and asked someone to wait for him at General Cano 32, and as he was about to hang up he stressed that they be sure to wait for him at 7:30 pm. After talking to whoever it was, he asked him to send him, at the same address on General Cano, two cases of quinine water and gingerale by 7 pm, without fail. I delivered them in person and took them into the kitchen and I noticed that the house was being repaired and that they were getting ready for company, since there were several bottles of liquor there. (COMMENT: No Soviets live at General Cano 32, NIKITIN lives at General Leon 32 and,

1. The-C/O and his wife went to Subj's home the evening of 20 Sept for dinner. He established a nicer relationship with Subj's wife, thus avoiding use of the C/O's alias, if ever. No others were present beside us, and Subj and his wife. Subj's son did not join at the dinner table. A bright touch on the part of Subj was that we were served the cavier that Prikhodko had recently brought to Subj.

Subj's wife, Esther, is an intelligent and charming person. She spoke with great perception of her experiences in the Soviet Union, when she had accompanied her husband there a few years ago. Although Subj has told the C/O that his wife does not know of the Intelligence relationship between them, it appeared evident to the C/O that Subj's wife considers the C/O in some kind of special relationship to her husband.

During the evening Subj reported to the C/O something that Prikhodko had said at their meet on 7 Sept, which he had omitted in reporting their meet. In speaking about the key con travel agents attending the INTURIST conference in Moscow in October 1966, Prikhodko stated: "We are interested that as many travel agents as possible go to the convention. Maybe we could later on use one of them. But the problem with the Mexicans is this- they are very affable and simpatico but when it reaches the point of a straight proposition, they are all "chicken.""

2. On 23 Sept Subj reported about the visit of Valentin Loginov to his office on 21 Sept. They went to the nearby Flor de Mexico for coffee. Subj, who had been instructed to probe further re Pavel Yatskov's probable assignment when he returns to Mexico, didn't have to. Loginov burst out to Subj; "You have to congratulate me - I am the Consul General." Subj asked who's going to be Loginov's assistant. Loginov answered, but Subj does not recall the name. Subj asked "What job are you planning to give Yatskov?" Loginov asked "Why me?" Subj said "You're a big shot". Loginov stated "He'll get a job. He will be some First Secretary of some Department."

The reason that Loginov came by to Subj is that he wants to investigate the shabby treatment that had been accorded the delegates to the Microbiological Congress in Moscow (Subj had told the C/O that the attendees to the Congress didn't even

Fernanda mentioned to Subj that there was a small nicular group in the Jewish community, and she wanted to know about it so they could join forces. Subj said he knew of no such in the Jewish community. Then Fernanda arved Subj to join the group and support it with money. Subj turned the proposition down.

4. I then asked him how the purchase of the watches was coming along. He told me that the morning after our last meeting (this would have been on 10 September, a Saturday) at about 0930 he went to the Trade Delegation building and asked for his good friend Yuriy (ISAYEV). ISAYEV said they are fresh out of watches but that they expect some more in 15 days at which time Subject should come back and ISAYEV will sell him all he wants. (COMMENT: In his notes for 12 September Subject says that SILNIKOV had come in to say that Subject's Soviet friends had wanted to give him a watch for his saints day on 11 September but that the Soviets are not out of them but that some would come in in fifteen days).

5. We then reviewed his notes. From now on I am not going to reproduce them in toto but only do certain items in brief form since they are tiresome, repetitious and now largely proven to be gross exaggerations plus fabrication.

6. General Notes:

11 September: STRIZHOV tells Subject that he has to drive the Ambassador every Sunday morning to play golf. Then follows Subject's account of the non-existent party.

12 Sept:

KOSTIKOV comes by at 1145 to offer regrets for not having come to yesterday's party and to say that Soviet cyclista will come to Mexico for the forthcoming winter Olympics. Later three new Soviets who don't speak Spanish come in. SILNIKOV said that they will leave (Mexico) soon. (COMMENT: probably the two audio techs.)

13 Sept.

At 1145 STRIZHOV and GOROBETS come in to say that SILNIKOV had an accident in his car on Marina Nacional that morning. (COMMENT: Accident confirmed by LIENVOY)

14 Sept.

The three new Soviets came in and brought a supply of mejoral, alka seltzer, razor blades, etc. For this reason Subject thinks they are on TDY from Cuba and are stocking up for return to this paradise.

15 Sept.

Description of "atentado" described above.

16 Sept:

Nothing

17 Sept:

LOGINOV tells him that he is now Consul in place of YATSKOV. Tells Subject he is looking for a 3 bedroom house with garden near the Embassy and not more than 4,000 MN per month. Asks Subject to look for one.

18 Sept:

Subject takes off on bicycle and finds a house at Avenue Chapultepec 180 with six bedrooms but renting at 5,000. Subject suspects thaLOGINOV won't like the 5,000 rent nor the fact that there is a vacant lot next door.

19 Sept

LOGINOV comes in at 0930 and Subject describes the house. LOGINOV will go by to look at it.

7. Special Notes on SILNIKOV

10 Sept (Saturday): SILNIKOV is alone from 1045 to 1110. Says he, STRIZHOV and GOROBETS will come to party next day after seeing KALYGIN off at airport. (Both LILYRIC and LIMITED have him leaving at 1012 in car and not returning by 1400)

11 Sept (Day of party): SILNIKOV comes in from 1100 to 1120. Says Soviets will have to leave the party a little early since they have to show a film to the Soviet kids in the Embassy, that evening. KORMUSHKIN then comes in and says can't come. At 1428 SILNIKOV, GOROBETS and STRIZHOV come in and all go to party, etc.

12 Sept: 1020 to 1040 SILNIKOV, GOROBETS and STRIZHOV come in to thank Subject for the party. 1450 SILNIKOV comes in alone for a quick tequila, 1510 SILNIKOV and STRIZHOV drop by to make small purchases.

13 Sept: 1130 to 1200 SILNIKOV comes in. Is looking for empty 1/3 liter jars. 1510 comes in again and tells about his car accident yesterday.

14 Sept: 1020 to 1100 - SILNIKOV comes in and explains the damage to his car. 1520 to 1535 was in again.

15 Sept: 1130 to 1205 SILNIKOV comes in. 1400 in again

16 Sept: Nothing.

17 Sept: 1010 SILNIKOV and STRIZHOV come in. 1450 SILNIKOV in alone.

18 Sept: 1100 SILNIKOV and STRIZHOV come in. Subject invites them home for lunch. They can't because STRIZHOV had to drive Ambassador to a conference with Chilean Ambassador. 1400 SILNIKOV in alone.

19 Sept: SILNIKOV comes in 3 times: 1100 to 1122; 1420 to 1440; 1830 to 1900 with STRIZHOV to eat tacos.

5. 
The C/O reminded Subj of what he basically was in Soviet eyes - an Eastern
Luropean refugee and a Jew. And more, he had never professed to them any ideological
sympathy to the Communist cause. The rest he had done was to declare that the
Soviets represented the wave of the future, and he wanted to be on the winning side.
But he must recognize that such sortiment coming from a Jew could hardly have
convinced the Soviets.

b) Next stare of approach to Soviets in Mexico:

The C/O suggested to Subj as an effective way to break off from the Soviets
that he should drop completely all affirmations of "friendship" - cut out the
"hasta la muerte" bit. Subj, in turning down any and all Soviet requests for
information or assistance, should couple it with the open declaration that he has
quit.

Subj agreed to follow this line, except for the qualification pertaining to
his presence in Moscow.

c) Clarify status of Loginov as "Consul":

Subj said that during his meet with Prikhodko and Loginov on 8 September 1966
while they were talking about Pavel Yatskov, whom Prikhodko said he had seen in
Moscow, Subj addressed the following question to Loginov: "When is your boss
coming back?" Loginov replied: "You're talking now to the Consul."

3. The C/O wished to clarify or reaffirm his understanding of Subj's response
   to Prikhodko on 8 September when the Soviet asked about legalizing a tourist in
   Mexico( reported in paragraph 4 of the Contact Report of 5 September). First,
   the C/O paraphrased for Subj the way he had reported Subj's reasoning process
   about Prikhodko's question (see Comment in raragraph 4 of the Contact Report)
   Subj said that it was essentially correct.

Then the C/o related the way he had reported Prikhodko's question and Subj's
reply. Subj said that that was not exactly how the conversation had taken place.
He-restated the conversation as follows:

Prikhodko which will be the best way to legalize (a tourist in Mexico)?

Subject: "You know the answers."

Prikhodko: "If you would have to put (a man in your office), would you be able to?"

Subject : "It would be difficult- necessary to consult Gobernación, because the
company had to have the required capitalization to place a foreigner.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: Ernst GOEBEL:

DATE OF MEETING: 8 September 1966

1. I met with Subject at his office on 8 September 1966 from 1730 to 1800. Next meeting is in about two weeks to be arranged by phone.

2. Subject reported that LOGINOV still comes fairly regularly to the French Club on weekends. Occasionally he bringa his wife. Once or twice he brought two young Soviet men in their early twenties. He has also brought a Soviet woman ca 25 who has played tennis with two other women (club members) whom Subject doesn't know. Subject hasn't seen GORLITSYN since our last meeting.

3. Since LOGINOV doesn't play tennis but only sits around outside or in the bar, Subject doesn't see him for sustained periods. Subject has seen LOGINOV talking to SARMIENTO or his wife two or three times. From observing him in the bar, Subject saw that LOGINOV is on speaking terms with several members.

4. I asked Subject if he knew Ofelia ALFARO Lopez (P-11339), a good friend of the SARMIENTOs and also in contact with the Soviets. He didn't recognize her name as a club member. When I told him that she teaches at the School of Economics, he remembered thet at a dinner party at the home of Henry SIEGMANN, an American and local head of Continental Oil Co., a Mexican woman was present who was a professor of Economics. She speaks excellent English and is in her thirties. He thinks this is ALFARO but is not sure. He will check his wife who is the name rememberer in the family.

5. Subject remarked that he found the above dinner strange for its odd mixture of solid bustness types and a few off-beat "beatnik" Mexican types including the female professor. He hastened to assure me that SIEGMANN was a sterling character.

6. For the next meeting Subject will attempt to confirm ALFARO's identity and also to spot likely club members who appear to be on close terms with the SARMIENTOS with the view of getting an assessment of the latter.

7. Subject is interested and willing. However, he does not appear to be very much interested in people. Thus he has played tennis with SARMIENTO for years and hasn't a thing to say about him except that he is a pleasant tennis companion. Similarly SARMIENTO's wife is good looking and a good tennis player.

8. I haven't had an opportunity to talk to Subject's wife yet because Subject says that she does not know the SARMIENTOS. I met his wife last fall and noted that she is much more alert, interested and lively in social relations than he is. Therefore I bet that she knows a lot more than he gives her credit for. I intend to invite them to dinner soon in order to talk with the wife and explore possibilities.

# SUBJECT: Contact lieport/ LICOZY-5 -P-2712 8 September 1966

7 Sept, a few minutes, Sears Ejercito Nacional

8 Sept, 1100-1200, Subj's office

1. On 7 Sept at about 1100 the C/O made a routine call to Subj's office to determine if Subj would be available that day. Subj responded that he was glad that the C/O had called because he had to see him urgently. In characteristic manner Subj trying doubletalk told the C/O that he had received a telegram, that his old friend (Prikhodko) was back, and that he was going to see the "two of them" (Prikhodko and Loginov) at 1500 that day at the Flor de Mexico. The C/o was puzzled by the reference to the telegram, and asked incredulously if the telegram had anything to do with setting up the meeting with his friends. Subj's answer was ambiguous, and the C/O let it go at that because he arranged a brief meet with Subj for 1230 at Seers Restaurant, at Ejercito Nacional, where Subj was to be on his own business at that time.

2. Nevertheless, in considering the briefing instruction to give to Subj the C/O had to allow for the fact that there might have been special circumstances in the Soviets' arrangement for their meet with Subj. Further, this was Prikhodko's first meet with Subj after return from Moscow, where it is presumed he had taken up Subj's case with his superiors and the line decided on how to deal in the future with their flagging, non-cooperative "agent." A reasonable contigency expectation was that the Soviets might have a "hot" proposition to make to Subj, and the C/o decided to brief Surj to the extent that if the Soviets broached a really important operational assignment, which Subj was to judge, Subj would conduct himself so as to draw out the Soviets but stall on acceptance. If nothing of overriding importance Como from the Soviets, Subj was to continue his friends-yes; work-no" stance

At 1230 the C/o saw Subj for just a few minutes, during which the telegram was explained it was from Moscow, inviting Subj's travel agency to participate in a seminar in Moscow 24-29 Oct 1966, detailed letter to follow. Further, Subj had learned from Prikhodko when the latter had called earlier in the morning to make the appointment for the meet that afternoon that Prikhodko was aware of the invitation and would talk to Subj about it at their meet. The C/O imparted to Subj the briefing outlined above, stressing that Subj must judge whether the Soviets were proposing something that was so important that he couldn't dismiss it out of hand - in which case he was to be non-committal and stall on a decision.

3. The C/O had communicated to the Station the tack he was going to take, and.. was later informed by the Station to reverse the planning of Subj's attitude toward a contingency proposition of the Soviets to a flat, unconditional "no."

Filence P-11712 P-2270 P-885 (P2) P-7447(52)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 182

Accordin-ly, the C/O tried to reach Subj at his office. Subj was not there so the C/O left a message to be given to Subj if he should arrive before 1500. The message was: "En el negocio con sus amigos debería usted decir "no" a todo." The шевзаде тигported to come from "Señor Berger."

In a telephone call to Subj at 1800 that evening the C/O learned from Subj that nothing of transcending importance had occurred at his meet with the Soviete, and so the C/o arranged to meet with Subf the following day 8 September

4. On 8 Sept Subj reported that he had wet Prikhodko and Loginov at 1500 the preceding day in the Flor de Mexico Restaurant. Prikhodko did most of the talking. He brought Subf the two kilos of caviar that Subj had requested (and paid for). He said he had had a good leave in the Soviet Union, and that the wedding (of his son) had gone off all right. He had spoken with Nechiporenko (who is still in Moscow and with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) who sent his regards to Subj and also four Russian records. He had seen Pavel Yatskov in Moscow who told him that he had met Subj in Paris. Yatskov would be returning to Mexico about 17 September 1966. Either Prikhodko or Loginov told Subj that loginov was now the Soviet Consul in Mexico. Loginov told Subj that he would pass by Subj's office on Monday (12 Sept).

They discussed the invitation to the travel agents to come to Moscow. Prikhodko said that twelve INTURIST representatives in Mexico had been invited, that he had the telegram and that he was going to coordinate the arrangements for the travel agents to attend the conference. /Comments The telegram sent to Subj in Spanish on 6 September 1966 said: "there will be a conference 24- 29 October in Moscow of travel agencies, that collaborate with INTURIST dealing with international touriami we invite your agency; a reduced price for the stay will be afforded a detailed letter follows."/ Prikhodko asked Subj if he thought of attending the conference. Subj said ho would like to go (and added with a twinkle) - "only from a business stard roint."

Irikhodko, for his part, in thin reference to Subj's uncooperative attitude said that Subj had put him into a hard spot with his superiors in Moscow. And now ne would have to consult with Moscow to see whet whether Subj can attend the travel agent conference. Subj asked archly "By letter?" Prikhodko replied "You're crazy- everything goes by cable." Subj stated "You can refuse me a visa." Prikhodko dismissed that that, saying that if Subj goes to Moscow he will he meet Prikhodko's colleagues, and that if Subj is in Moscow the doctors there would be happy to check into Subj's health (a matter mentioned previously with both Loginov and Prikhodko). Subj, responding somewhat nockingly to this expression of concern by the Soviets, said he was still their friend and one of them.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 183

3. 
Prikhodko then remarked something to the effect that Subj now didn't want to do anything for them -what with his bad health and being tied up in business- but that maybe in the future..... and then got very much into the present by sliding easily into the old grooves he said "I talked/y8u several times about a man coming tourist to Mexico - what is the best way to arrange legal residence- could it be done through your office - he could be attached to your office- he doesn't have to work there."

/Comments Subj explained to the C/O that he sensed the trap immediately, recognizing that this was the old bent of the Soviets on which he had furnished a wealth of information in the past. Subj reasoned that if the Soviets were fishing with the old bait, he would not rise to it eagerly because in view of his recent non- cooperative behavior it would only confirm to the Soviets that he was being controlled (by the AIS). He would not reject the insinuation of his cooperation out of hand and categorically, because that would not be consistent with his posture of remaining on friendly terms with the Soviets. Therefore he took the middle road, that of being non-committal or uncommitted, where the initiative of compliance was always in his hands. Parenthetically, Subj told the C/O that if the "relief" is that of complete rejection of the Soviets he should not have even met them; but following the policy of "hasta la muerte- amigos, pero hacer nada" he felt he was doing the right thing in stringing them along a barren path. Thus, without batting an eye he simply repeated what he had already told them./ Subj said he would have to consult Gobernacion- because he didn't know if his company had the required capitalization to place a foreigner in a job - but this being Mexico, anything could probably be done./Comments Subj remarked to the C/O at this point that the Soviets could not seriously consider using Subj's firm to "legalize" their man, because it would be a patent fraud to the employees in his firm, and he did not think the Soviets were stupid about such things/.

The C/O's summary comment to Subj's unspoken plea for criticism of his course of action was that under the concept of a "friends, yes; work, no" policy toward the Soviets he was doing a fine job of walking the tightrope.

5. The C/O asked Subj if there had been any travel arrangements for non-Soviets to the Soviet Union. Subj replied that Julio Rothenstreich, whom Subj characterized as a German Jew, and his wife, a Russian-Jew, had left 5 Sept to New York en route to the Soviet Union. Subj said Rothenstreich had told him that he was friendly with the Soviet Ambassador in Mexico and represented "Russian firms" (sic). He was to remain in the Soviet Union 15 days and visit a few cities, Moscow, Kiev and Volgograd- and then some cities in Europe, Vienna and Paris, Subj said that Rothenstreich's


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

own fira was making the hotel reservations in the Soviet Union for him. Subj'said he had met once before with Rothenstreich years ago, but didn't know anything about him.

Subj also mentioned a widower in his sixties, David Nosofsky, who left for the Soviet Union on 1 Sep - Hosafoky has a brother in Kick.

6. The C/O had noticed a new face among Subj's employees and asked Subj who the Girl was. Subj explained that he had taken on the new girl, Leticia Cisneros, the daughter of one of Subj's guides in Mexico, as possible replacement for Miriam Avila Kats, who has an offer to work for the Israeli Embassy in Mexico. Subj said lhe would not want to lose Mirian because, even though she is a slow worker, she is capable and also a nice girl. If Mirian should leave, Leticia would take over her work (which includes the responsibility for non- Soviet travel to the Soviet Union).

7. The C/O questioned Subj about his attitude toward attending the travel agent conference in loscow. Subj said that from a business standpoint he would want to attend, or if not him personally someone from his firm, like Miriam. He was intorested in INTURIST business, and felt that he should know what plans INTURIST will be formulating inasmuch as his competitors will be there. He is interested to know what percentage he gets of INTURIST business. He believed that INTURIST would foot 50% of the costs of staying in the Soviet Union during the conference. The C/O asked if Subj knew the other travel agencies that were to be invited. Of the twelve from Mexico Subj felt that the following were included: Garza, Carza Tours, De Carlo Tours, Viajes Kelia, Cook's, MexAmerica, Pegaso, Excursiones y Viajes (EVISA), American Express, and possibly Autoviajes Internacionales. Subj knew the "jefes" of all these.

Subj plans to attend the International Congress and Convention Association meeting in Israel on 30 October 1966. He is considering the possibility of going to Moscow for the travel agent meeting 24-29 Oct and then going on to Israel.

The C/O told Subj to let him know Prikhodko's results re permission for Subj to attend the Moscow meeting.

8. Subj requested the C/O to obtain one case each of Red, White and Rosee French wine, the "best" available

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:
LICOZY-5 Meeting with PRIKHODKO and LOGINOV on 7 September 1966

1. LICOZY-3 reported that he had a meeting with PRIKHODKO and LOGINOV at 1500 on 7 September at a Restaurant in town.

2. LILYRIC reports that on 7 September LOGINOV left the Embassy alone in his own car at 1405 going north on Tacubaya. PRIKHODKO left alone on foot to the east at 1416. They both returned together in LOGINOV's car at 1720.

3. Thus LOGINOV picked up PRIKHODKO somewhere and took him to the LICOZY-5 meeting. This is not only a good anti-surveillance device but also helps to prevent us associating the two.

# SUMMARY:

31 August 1966

1. nothinged and/y returned on his trip, except for his meeting.
   Pavel Yatskov in Mexico on 25 August. Before Subj had left for his trip
   he told/drew Yatskov to his agent in Paris for Yatskov to get
   some free transportation to Paris. Had not mentioned to Yatskov that Subj had arrived
   in Paris. Had they had a short talk about inconsequential
   matters. Had/Subj said that Yatskov would be returning to Mexico.

2.  The C/O asked Subj if there had been any Soviet travel booked through his office during his absence. Subj said there had, and called in his employee who took care of such matters, Moya Ornuelas. Ornuelas brought Subj the reservations for: Vladimir departing 1 Sept 1966 Mexico/Paris via Air France through to Moscow. Subj was about to ask Consultant M if he should ping for, but the C/O told him to let it ping for the time being and he would like Ornuelas to associate the C/O with requests concerning Soviets.

Subj said that Loginov had asked at some previous time about the employees in Subj’s office, and asked Subj if there had been any continued interest by the Soviets in his employees. Subj said he knew of none. The C/O re-stated what he already knows that Ornuelas handled Soviet travel, and Miriam Avila handled non-Soviet travel to the Soviet Union - and asked Subj if both were trustworthy employees. (Note: Subj has a file on Ornuelas, but now on Avila - the C/O did not want at that time to call for Ornuela’s file asked Subj just a few questions respecting both employees, and said we would want to fill a request for information at a later date - giving as reason that we wanted file information on any one dealing with the Soviets.) The facts adduced on each employee at this meeting were:

David Gradilla: worked for Subj about 5 years; Subj acquired David from another travel agency because he was more efficient in tariffs. Subj called him a bit mixed up because sometimes he was “left” and other times “to the right.”

Miriam Avila Mathes (see Report this Subj 13 July 1966): worked for Subj about 2 years. Mother is American, family from Akron, Ohio. Miriam had worked for Aeronaves at the New York World Fair, after which she applied for a job to Subj. Subj commented that Miriam is very Jewish - minded, and intensely interested in Israel, to which she has traveled twice.

3.  The C/O reminded Subj that if he is contacted by the Soviets he maintains his no-work stance with them. Subj nodded agreement.

5. Concerning the big day, 21 August, Subject had the following to say in addition to the information in his notes. This information was in response to my questions :

a. They left the store at ca 1410 and stopped off to get barbecued chicken (COMMENT: they didn't actually arrive at LICOWL'S until 1507.)

b. They went in a blue Station wagon (COMMENT: this is 17 DA).

c. The Soviets left at ca 1800 (COMMENT: correct).

d. Besides LICOWL and his wife and the two Soviets, only LICONL's daughter and son-in-law were present.

6. Later on in the meeting Subject volunteered the information that SHNIKOV had told him that he had obtained permission to conć to LICCEL's home (COMMENT: Strange conduct for someone who is playing the part of a case officer.) Subject also voluntôt.ed that he had told SILNIKOV that LOGINOV had called a girl from the store on Saturday (See Subject's notes for 20 August). SILNIKOV's reaction was one of approval, noting that LOGINOV was a infchelor now. I asked Subject if he didn't think his statement was a bit indiscreet since he could have burned LOCINOV, espoerally since SILNIKOV has now shown an interest in security measures. He said I was right but it was obvious that his aspect didn't bother him in the least either before or after my question.

7. I asked Subject what he thought about SILNIKOV's erratic behavior about wanting, women, pornographic material, etc. in that he vaises and drops the subject without any sense of continuity. Subject answered this by proposing that we send a girl under our control to visit his store and he would introduce her to SILÁTKOV (COM Exactly what we are trying to do with LIRUSTIC-1), I pointed out that such a girl would have to live in the neighbor- hood or her presence in the store would be suspect. He then said thật the girl could be invited to his home at a time when SILNIKOV was there. Subject would introduce her as a friend from Jalisco and Tet nature take its course. I told him that his idea has basic merit but could be quite difficult to implement in a secure manner. I remarked that it was a shame that he had been unable to come up with suitable candidates in his neighborhood. He said that, họ hạc Many suitable friends in the neighborhood but that more suitable since they weren't the types to whom hè could suggest such an idea. I told him that he couldn't but we could, he would spot suitable candidates.

2. and that his "maybe" was just a umy of joshing Loginov. Subj then asserted to
   the C/O that he felt strong in his capacity to deal with the Sarlets, and that
   his joking remarks in no way vitiated that strength..
   The C/O brought up the matter of Subj's having told Loginov he would supply
   his personal documents to Loginov, and (solely with the design of reaching for
   Subj's motive) stated that we thought it would be better if Sudj did nothing
   to pass these documents to the Soviets and held them off indefinitely. Subj
   appeared a bit chagrined at the C/O's request, and told the C/O why: he
   minted to give those "bastards" his documents to show them he had nothing to
   hide, and that he was not afraid of them; if he didn't give over his documents
   they might think they had something on him. Further he felt that he was buying
   Insurance by handing them over openly, and gave as an example that he might be
   flying in Europe and might find himself diverted or force-landed in a place
   like Prague, or Warsaw - and it would be a comfort to him to know that ho Aothing..
   to be afraid of concerning any irregularities in his past.
   Therefore, Sub I asked the C/O to check with his "bosses" to see if he could
   get the go-ahead on handing over his documents. Subf said if the answer to "no"
   he will comply, but his pleading to the C/O appeared as if Subf thought his was
   the wiser course. /Comment: Despite the C/O's method of challenging Subf on
   specifics, like the "maybe" and the passing of the documents, the C/O's oun
   Filmopinion is that Subf has achieved a very satisfactory status in his dealinga
   th the Soviete, satisfactory in the sense that it is in accord with the
   Station's objectives in the case and equally important that it can be maintained
   because it is consistent with Subj's personality and outlook.

7. Subj expressed a destre for another get-together with the C/O and his wife.
   The C/O explained that his wife would be leaving Mexico by mid-January-and
   Sudj, who doesn't need any pictures to be drawn for him, immediately hazarded
   the opinion that that meant that the C/O would be leaving nat too long after.
   The C/O acknowledged this possibility, but said he had no idea of when it would
   take place. Sub I wanted to know if there would be someone to take the C/O'e
   place when the time came, and the C/O answered that of course there would.
   The time for the get-together is left for some indefinite date before the
   C/O's wife departe.

13 Dec 1930-2000, Hotel Reforma

1.  The C/O arranged to deliver some liquor to Sudj at the time he was hosting an Air France cocktail at the Hotel Reforma. After the liquor was transferred to Subj's car in a nearby parking lot, Subj recounted to theC/O the story of a visit he had had from Valentin Loginov that day.

2.  Subj reported that Loginov cans to his office unannounced and prevalled on Sudj to step down to the strest to have a coffee with him. Loginov presented. Subf with four bottles of vodka for Christmcs, and then started to ask Subj some personal questions

    1) How had Suby left Poland (after WILL) for Faris- had his documentation been legal or tilegal. Subf answered that it was legal.

    2) How was he able to enter Faris-did họ have a valid French visa. Subj said he did. How long did he stay in Paris. Subf sald a few months.

    3) has he released from service with the (Polish) UB? Subj-said-yes. Noro.. there any conditions to this release. Sudj said no. хаха наз he supposed to de contacted by the Foles. Sudj said yes, and related the story of how he uno contacted in Mexico (in March 1955) by a Polish diplomatic courier who drought a letter from Subj's old boss in the UB, Stanchuk (phonetic), and how Subj answered that letter. /Comment: Believe the story given in some detail in debriefing of Subj on his experiences in UB and WWII. Loginov wanted to know if Sudj's response to Poles had been, positive or negative. Subf sald it had been neutral. Asked why, Subj replied that he believed that eighty percent of the Foles were anti-Soviet. Loginou said "You are right."

    4) Loginov asked Sudj how he was getting along with the American airlines he deals with. Sudj sald "fine", and asked why. Loginov sald that maybe, if Subj has the chance, he can learn the name of the director of the CIA in Mexico. Subij told Loginov he was crazy, or couldn't be serious; he couldn't get that information. Loginov asked Surf if he could, would he tell the Soviets. Subj said "maybe."

Subf said to Loginov that he would show Loginov the documents that back up his answers to Loginov's questions, but that he was busy through Christmas, but could possibly see him after Christmas and before New Years.

3.  The C/O asked Surf if he had inquired of Loginov why the latter was asking such questions. Sudj sald he did not, even though he was completely puzzled by this tack on the part of the Soviets. But Sudj felt perfectly at ease in telling the truth to the Soviets, and had no hesitation in showing them his documentation.

The C/O told Sudj that we would discuss this matter further.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: LICOWL-1

DATE OF MERTING: 13 December 1966

1. I met Subject on 13 December 1966 at the corner of Nazás and Melchor Ocampo at 1400. The meeting was held in my car and lasted until 1515. I paid him 800 MN salary for December and 800 MN Christmas bonus for 1966. Next meeting is for Tuesday, 3 January 1967 at 1500 at the same place.

2. Subject started out by showing me 4 pieces of paper he had picked up near the incinerator. They were worthless and I later told him not to attempt to pick up any more paper since it is not worth the risk.

3. I then reviewed the SGSWIRL examination with him. I told him that because of his lies and exaggerations, none of his previoud information was considered valid and that rather than "being more useful to us" his material had meant a lot of work for nothing. I told him that I would give him another chance and that we were starting a new operation. Throughout my talk he was quite uncomfortable. He did not try to defend himself but simply agreed to whatever I said. Although he thanked me for the second chance he did not appear to be too contrite.

4. Following are the few interesting items from his notes :

a. On 12 December at ca 1700 KORMUSHKIN came in with another Soviet. KORMUSHKIN asked Subject when he was going to invite him to his home for a drink, Subject suggested Sunday, 18 December. They agreed to meet at the store at 1500. Subject described the other Soviet as a young diplomat ca 29-30 with a thin build who comes in only seldom. He was a friend of Oleg NECHIPORENKO (vas already here when NECHIPORENKO was here) and went to the fiesta at Subject's home which was attended by NECHIPORENKO and KOSTIKOV and wives. (COMMENT: I remember a report on this fiesta but can't find it anywhere). Subject asked me for instructions, dinner, girls, etc? I told him to go along with it, have then to his house without other guests and offer them only liquor and snacks. Subject is to determine KORMUSHKIN's motive in asking himself to Subject's home. By the way whenever Subject has mentioned KORMUSHKIN in the last few months he has invariably remarked that he is a very heavy drinker.

b. On 6 December LOGINOV came in from 1230 to 1242. He had previously asked Subject about helping the Soviets to find a house for their school. This time he asked about the now (LILYRIC) building - how much an apartment costs (1500 MN), who lives there (chemical engineer in penthouse (LILYRIC), a German family on the second floor, etc. LOGINOV's questions were general and so were Subject's answers.

c. On Saturday 3 December 1966 SILNIKOV came in from 1412 to 1430. He asked for two receipts of ca 5 MN each for bread, saying that he had lost the real ones. Subject thinks he uses these small suns to buy beer and girlie magazines. SILNIKOV then leafed through a girlie magazine and then said he wants Subject to find him a girl for whose favors he is willing to pay 100 MN. (COMMENT: chiseling 10 MN in false receipts and in the next breath offering 100 MN for a girl?)

# 1. Concerning the telephone call of 6 December 1966 from Carlos BLANCO to Valentin 8. LOGINOV at the Soviet Fabassy in which BLANCO told LOGINOV that "El comandanto Carlos" (Carlos CABAMADRID Miranda) wanted to see Pavel A. YATSKOV on an urgent matter, the following information may pertain to this discussion :

a. On 11 October 1985 at 2200 hours Pavel A. VATSKOV vas soon having dinner with an unidentified Mexican wale at the "La Tablita" Restaurant on the corner of Ejercito Racional and Gutenborg. At the end of their peal the Dexican pushed a small object scross the table towards YATSKOV. YATSKOV covered this object with his napkin and then put the object in his pocket. It was obvious that this object was passed in a clandestine mantor. They then left the restaurant together and separated. The Mexican then went to a jeep with DP license 11-63 (1964-1965 issue) and drove off alone. This jeep had a seal reading "Procuraduria Gonoral de Justicia del Distrito y Territorios Federalos Policia Judicial." Thus, it can be assumed that the person is an employee of the Judicial Polico.

b. The unidentified Mexican wale was described as about 35 years old, about 170 cm tall, 70 kilos in weight, slight build, dark complexion, dark eyes, black coustache, and ho was dressed in a conservative business suit.

# 2. It is noted that both Carlos CABAMADRID and Carlos BLANCO are similar in appearance to the above described person.

# 3. Carlos CASAMADRID Miranda called Oleg M. HECHIPORENKO at the Soviet Fabassy on 10 March 1963 and on 16 Marcy 1965. On 10 March 1965 CASAMADRID called to confirm a dinner with NECHIPORENKO on the same day. On 16 March 1965 NECHI PORENKO was not in.

# 4. Carlos BLANCO called Valentin 8. LOGINOV on 1 November 1965 and 10 November 1986. In addition Graciela 507) (a friend of BLANCO's) called LOGINOV on behalf of BLANCO on 8 September 1966 and 9 November 1966. All of the above calls vore to arrange social meetings between BLANCO and LOGINOV.

# 5. All of the above named Soviets are KGB officers. LOGINOV took the place of NECHIPORENKO when KECHIPORENKO left Mexico. LOGINOV arrived in Mexico on 3 August 1965. According to the telephone conversation he was already a good friend of BLANCO's on 1 November 1965. Thus it would appear that LOGINOV

was put into contact with BLANCO by another Boviot, probably NECHIPORENKO or YATSKOV. It is interesting to note that, although CASAMADRID Bas been in contact with NECHIPORENKO and BLANCO has been la contact with LOGIROV, there is no pervious indication that either knee YATSEDV. YATSEOV is the KGB chief of both NECHI PORENKO and LOGINOV.

SUBJECT: LICOML-1

DATE OF MEETING: 21 November 1966

1. I picked Subject up at the corner of Nilo and Melchor Ocampo at 1100 on 21 November 1966. The meeting was held in my car on a side street and lasted 50 minutes. I paid Subject 800 MN, his salary for November 1966. Next meeting is for 1100 on 1 December at the above place. Subject will be given an SGSWIRL examination at this meeting.

2. Subject didn't have a word to say about LOGINOV'S attempt to recruit him. When I asked about it, he said he thinks that LOGINOV is out of town since he hasn't seen LOGINOV since his last meeting with me. His notes for 17 November say that at 1210 Yurly (ISAYEV) came in with another "diplomat" and both bought cigarettes. ISAYEV told Subject (apparently out of the blue) that LOGINOV had been very busy and therefore hadn't been able to see Subject. ISAYEV then added Subject shouldn't forget about what LOGINOV had asked him. Subject answered that he didn't know what ISAYEV was talking about. ISAYEV simply answered, "Good, he will come to see you). I asked Subject why ISAYEV would be discussing LOGINOV's business with him. Subject had no idea, except that he thinks, because of this, that they are connected professionally. (COMMENT: GRU and KGB?)

LICORL-1

DATE OF MEETING:

10 November 1966

1. I picked Subject up on the corner of Nazas and Melchor Ocampo at 1100 on 10 November. The meeting was held in my car and lasted an hour. Next meeting is for 21 November at 1100.

2. Subject started things out by saying that LOGINOV is tryin to recruit him to report on LIEMPTY-6. Review of his notes and discussion revealed the following: On 5 November LOGINOV came on. Subject told him he had found a house on Juanacatlan. LOGINOV said that he's looking for one on the Chapultapec Park side of Talz. Tacubaya and for Subject to keep looking. Then LOGI V said that he would like to rent an apartment at P.A. de Santos 104. Subject told him they are all occupied. LOGINOV said Subject must know these apartments well. Subject admitted that he did and began to sketch them by LOGINOV didn't seem to be interested in his efforts. LOGINOV then asked how many apartments there were in the building. Subject answered, 16. LOGINOV then said that since Subject knows the apartments so well he must also know the people who live there. Subject admitted that he did. At this point some other Soviets came in and the conversation was terminated. On 6 November LOGINOV dropped by for some small talk and left some Soviet chocolate (which Subject showed me) for Subject's grandchild. On 9 November LOGINOV came in at 1230 and asked Subject to go to a restaurant with him. Subject countered by saying his wife was home sick and he had no one to leave the store with. Subject then invited LOGINOV to his house but LOGINOV insisted on a restaurant. Subject agreed to go on 12 or 13 November.

3. From the above Subject concludes that LOGINOV wants to recruit him to report on LIEMPTY-6 (who lives in P.A. de los Santos 104). I asked why LOGINOV would be interested in LIEMPTY-6 (there is nothing about him in the notes). Subject answered that he finds LIEMPTY-6 very suspicious because in the 5 years that he has known him, Subject doesn't know what he does for a living. He thinks he writes novels. In any case he is home all day long. In addition he lies. Example: He told Subject that he owns the new (LILYRIC) building. He is also eccentric. Besides his windows face on the Embassy. LIEMPTY-6 has apartment 17. The apartment directly below his, number 13, (probably old LILYRIC) is empty. Subject went to see the owner having LOGINOV in mind. The owner said that the apartment had been rented by LIE MPTY-6 which Subject also finds surprising. The whole theme was that he is suspicious of LIEMPTY-6 and that LOGINOV wants to recruit him to report on him. All of the above on LIEMPTY-6 and his apartment was verbal. There was not a word about him in his notes.

4. I told Subject that if LOGINOV tries to recruit him for any purpose, he is to cut him short and to indignantly refuse. He is also to tell LOGINOV that SILNIKOV had tried the same thing two months ago.

money. He is 28-30 years old, married and has worked for Nicolas for 2 or 3 years. (COMMENT: Colonia Pensil is in the western part of Tacuba and is full of Lagos, but nothing anywhere near Lago Coni). I told Subject to go ahead and get me the information on Nicolas LNU anyway. His notes on this are in the entry for 26 October.

5. With this Subject ran out of volunteered information and we attacked his notes which contained the following items worthy of note:

a. On 11 October LOGINOV came in and asked Subject to keep looking for a house near the Embassy. He said they want it for a school to which the children can walk since driving them back and forth to the present school is proving cumbersome. He also suggested that Subject sign the rental contract since many people are unwilling to rent to Soviets. When I expressed surprise about Subject signing a contract for 5,000 pesos a month he said that he had done it before for a Soviet Colonel in 1953 (the year Stalin died). This house was at Chicontepec 70 and rented for 4,000 pesos. (COMMENT: That Subject could sign a contract for 5,000 pesos a month is ridiculous. That the Soviets are looking for a new school just after moving into the now ono is strange).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 200

usual effervescent self, asked immediately if I had gotten the papers he left for me, stated that he had decided to go to Moscow, rattled off his schedule, gave me the names of the only other two travel agents he knew were going, repeated several times he'd be happy to give me a report when ne returned, and asked, as if he hoped I didn't, if there was anything I wanted to tell him before he left. I got the floor about this time and proceeded to backtrack over some of the ground just covered. As for his schedule and itinerary, he plans to leave for Moscow on 23 October via Air France, stopping over briefly in Paris; to make a side trip to Kiev on 27 and 28 October; and to leave Moscow for Paris via Air France on 30 October. He will fly from Paris to Genoa for a day on travel business and then return to Mexico from Paris on Air France via New York, where he plans to pick up a couple of suits and take in "Superman" on Broadway. He will arrive back in. Mexico on 3 00000ers November.

3. Subject said that in addition to the other three agents whom he had mentioned last time as having been invited to the Intourist Conference--Moises SCHUSTER of Mundos Tours, Carlos IBARGUEN of De Carlo Tours, and
   Edmundo GARZA of Garza Travel Service--he had learned that Isaac BULAEVSKY of Jet Travel Agency had also received an invitation. Besides himself, however, only SCHUSTER and BULAEVSKY are going, the other two having decided against the trip for unknown reasons. Subject mentioned that SCHUSTER is going to take his son, who is in his early teens.

4. I asked Subject if he had been in touch with anyone at the Soviet Embassy about the trip or if anyone there seemed to be responsible for lining up participants

LICY-1 Contact Report 2:18 0166


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 201

for or to have any special interest in the Conference. Subject replied that he had been at the Soviet Embassy about the middle of September on visa business and had seen the Soviet he always deals with on visa matters, but that this individual seemed surprised to hear Subject had been invited to Moscow and claimed to know nothing--or at least none of the details--about the Intoruist Conference. Subject claimed not to be able to remember the Soviet's name, hunted around in his wallet unsuccessfully for the Soviet's card, and then said, well, in any case it was the individual he had mentioned last time as having just gotten a promotion to Consul. I finally asked him if he meant LOGINOV--whose name he had given me last time--and after thinking for a moment, he rolled that yes, that sounded right. I then asked him if LOGINOV had shown any more interest in him or in any way been more friendly toward him in the last couple of months or since he had received the Intourist invite, Subject replied that he had not.

5. Subject seemed a little sensitive to this question, and I stated that I was sure he understood why I was asking, since I knew he had been thoroughly briefed by one of my predecessors prior to his 1963 trip to the Soviet Union on Soviet interest in visitors to the USSR. I explained that we had no intention to ask him to do what he had agreed to do on his last trip to the USSR (accept recruitment if offered) and that we did not want to burden him with any instructions on how to behave or respond while there. However, I said, we continued to feel he was of potential interest to the Soviets and wanted to make sure he was aware of this when he went over, had a healthy respect for the leverage the Soviets have on their home ground, and

14 Oct 1200-1245, Subj's office

14 October 1966

1.  Subj reported that Valentir Loginov had dropped by the office during the week and went to have coffee with Subj (Subj remarked that Loginov doesn't seem to want to talk in the office). Loginov had brought along visa application forms for Subj, and Subj filled them out for himself and his son, Marcos, and turned them over to Loginov, along with the passports (attached are copies of the visas- notes: the visas are good for over 20 days in the Soviet Union, although the INTURIST conference is from 24 Oct to 29 Oct).

Loginov told Subj that Pavel Yatskov wanted to see him (presumably Yatskov has brought something back for Subj). Subj asked Loginov what Yatskov is doing.
The Soviet replied that Yatskov has a job in the Embassy. Subj pressed: "what kind of a job. It's worthwhile that you gave him a good job." Loginov replied: "You want to know too much."

2.  The C/O asked Subj what decided him to go to the Soviet Union. Subj replied that he had a commission from the Petroleum Congress (Subj is involved in organizing the Congress for Mexico for 2 to 8 April 1967), actually in behalf of KLI and his own interests, to persuade the Soviets that they use some other airline than Aeroflot to transport the Soviet delegates to Mexico. /Comments: the C/O saw a confidential letter from KLI which set out the probability that the Soviets would want to use Aeroflot but that they had not committed themselves as yet as to number of delegates that would attend or the means by which they would transport delegates; attached is a copy of a letter to Dr. H.S. Namotkin appointing Subj in his visit to Moscow to talk to Dr. Nametkin - the letter states that "the future visit of Subj is exclusively connected to assist the National Committee which is patently not the case since Subj is attending the INTURIST conference/."

At any rate Subj has decided to go to Moscow, and is taking his sons along.

* Subj repeated his tactic in Moscow as far as contacts with the Soviets are concerned. He will not seek them out, not even Nechiporenko, and if contacted by them he will be affable and non-committal, and not put the sharp issue to them that he is through.

He said the latter remains his position in Mexico, or anywhere else but in the Soviet Union.

3.  The attached booklet of the World Petroleum Congress contains the names of the National Committees of the Iron Curtain countries. Attached are listings of the Czechoslovak delegates and a letter detailing the Hungarian delegates along with financial arrangements for them.

4.  The C/O will see Subj before he leaves Mexico on 22 October.

7 October 1966

7 Oct 1145-1230, Sudj's office

1. Subj had been to Los Angeles, California for a few days and had returned to Mexico on 5 Oct. Evidently he had accompanied a iuebla delegation that visited Douglas and Lockheed aircraft factories in California, He mentioned that Acronaves had purchased two DC#8's from Douglas, and ordered some DC-918. At the Lockheed plant they saw the new super-sontt airplane.

2. Subj had received on 6 Oct a confirmatory telegram from INTURIST, for Subj and his son (cony attached), re attendance at the INTURIST conference in loscow. Also, in the mail of 7 Oct Subj had received INTURIST releases on travel romulations for tourists to the Soviet Union, promotional plans, tours, etc. (Sudj will make copies of these for turnover to the C/O)

Subj reported that Valentin Loginoy came by the office on 29 Sept. Subj was with a friend, Peter Poter Barr, of New York, so he went to have coffee with Losinov, taking along his friend. The discussion was innocuous, but Loginov asked Subj if he would be going to see his friends, which Subj took to mean that all was: O.K. as far as Sudj's attendance in Moscow for the I'TUPEST conference. Subi answered "yes". Loginov jokingly asked Subf whey Husk had come to Nexico. Subj bantered a reply that the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs was going to serve some rare Champagne that ask liked. Lovrinov pressed Subj for the real reason. July said cagily that he knew, but he wasn't roing to tell lepinov. /Comment: his hanter is inclulo to de onstrate the time of relationship that exist between Sul. Art.in fron from Loginov that borders on ri ervire for information or involving Subj, the latter turns away with a joking answer. Leinov accepts this in offood-naturedly, jokingly calling Subj "a son of a bitch" or worse./

3. Subi discussed it, the e C/O the prospect of his going to the Soviet Union. He was debating in it on mind the advisability of it. The C/O probed to see has Sutj retarded it from sinens standpoint, putting the question "if you didn't go, do you think it would hurt you from the standpoint of business." Subj said he just didn't know. The C/O asked if others went (Subj had just said that possibly Garza, Chine end kov (Phonetic) would go although they were not certain) did Subj think the Soviets right throw the bulk of the business their way. Again Subj daid he didn't knez. The C/O then said that unless there were some overriding business reason, Subj should take into account our view that there was a margin of hazard

2. 
to Subj's being inside the Soviet Union. Subj said that personally he had no great desire to go to the Soviet Union, on three counts: 1) the climate 2) "the pleasant atmosphere" (his way of saying that if he was out of trace with the Soviets they wouldn't put out the red carpet for him as they did previously) and 3) he was plain afraid.

The latter apparently touched some hidden spring in Subj. Heretofore Subj had limited himself to calling the Soviets "boutards" etc. and anti-semitic. Now, Subj chided himself for doing so little to alleviate the lot of the Jews in the Soviet Union. He declared that the Soviet Union was the worst offender against the Jews, because they were eliminating the race, not through physical extermination, but through forcing assimilation. His own view was that the Soviets were more dangerous to the Jews and Israel than were the Arabs, for instance Lebanon or Jordan, who if it weren't for fear of Nasser would make their peace with Israel.

The C/O tried to counter the self-recrimination of Subj by telling him that he had accomplished a superb job in the duel of the West with the Soviets through his cooperation with us. That, in view of his real feelings about the Soviets, his dealing with them had been masterful. Subj shook off the C/O's optimistic view of Subj's contribution to the "cause."

4. The C/O brought up the request to get full details on the travel of all non-Soviets to the Soviet Union - and suggested that Subj automatically have duplicates made of the visa requests for such people. Subj said that would be simple - and he would instruct "Miriam" (the employee who handles INTUPIST travel) to make copies of all applications for visas. Comments the C/O asked Subj if Kiriam (Avila Katz) were going to remain in his employ, not taking a job at the Israeli Embassy - and Subj replied that she was going to stay on in Subj's firm/.

Subj had remarked that he was going to discuss the matter of making the Moscow trip with his wife. The C/O asked that Subj advise us as soon as he had come to a decision- either for or against going to the Soviet Union.

The C/O told Subj that he would pass by his office next week to pick up the copies of the INTURIST material.

22 September 1966 (Thursday)

(LOGINOV) came in for cigarettes. He said that there are 52 Mexicans studying at Lusumba. These students are going to be the directors in the schools of the Politechnico Nacional since one of them has come back well prepared in physics. (Thote follows a diatribe against those bad Mexicana who want to make Mexico another Cuba.)

23 September 1966 (Friday)

The "Spanish' type" came in with a briefcase and bought Raleighs with filters. He had the same type of billfold as the other Soviets. He then went directly to the Dabassy. (I asked if he had a moustache; he said, yos. This is probably GAZIYEV).

24 September 1966 (Saturday)

In the afternoon SILNIKOV was there when (ISAYEV) came in.. I asked the latter about the watches and he said that they wouldn't arrive until the end of the year. SILNIKOV left at 1620.

26 September (Monday)

A useless blurb about an unnamed Soviet who came in and discoursed on MADRAZO, saying that he will set up a new party and an anti-Soviet blast.

27 September (Tuesday)

(DENISOV) came in at 1210 and made a phone call. I heard him mention Delicias and del Rio. Since these towns are near the border near San Diego, I think he was talking about smuggling arms to Guatemala (sic). Afterwards I asked after his wife. He said that she and their daughter are in Moscow and that he is a bafchelor. I asked if he was able to find a girl. He answered, of course, but they all want a house. He left at 1230.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: LICANNY-1- P-3415

DATE OF MEETING: 28 September 1966

1. LICOZY-5 reported on 20 September that LICANNY-1 of Garza-Lopez Tours was one of those invited to attend the 24-29 Intourist Conference in Moscow. This was confirmed by LIENVOY on the same date. Since the Station had had no contact with Subject sine 6 January 1966, I contacted Don Lautz of the Visa Section on 27 September to see if Subject was still coming into the Embassy regularly on visa business. Lautz said that Subject had for some time now been sending an agent to the Embassy rather than coming himself. Lautz readily agreed to give Subject a call, however, and reached him late that afternoon. He told Subject that the "people" at the Embassy whom he had introduced Subject to earlier were interested in talking with him and asked if he could drop into the Embassy in the next few days. Subject immediately recognized which "people" Lautz was referring to, said that as a matter of fact he had something to discuss with "them," commented that it probably in fact involved the same matter, and agreed to come to Lautz's office at 11:00 the next day. As he had done with Irving A. Oronsky, Lautz agreed to let me use his office to talk to Subject.

2. I went to Lautz's office at 11:00 on the 28th, but when Subject had not appeared by 11:15, Lautz agreed to call me in my office when Subject arrived. Lautz called about 11:30, and I went right down. By the time I got there, however, Subject had already explained to Lautz that he was sure I wanted to talk about his invitation to

Files: P-2712 P-11712 P-11996


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 207

the USSR and had given Lautz a list of three other
invitees to the Intourist conference. Lautz introduced
me by true name as Oronsky's replacement. Sutject, in
what Lautz had forewarned me was his usuale over-enthusiastic
manner, greeted me with a "believe me, it is my pleasure"
salutation and, upon confirming that it was the Intourist
conference I was interest in, took off from there. Without
the slightest prompting, he rattled off the following:

a) He had received a telegram from Moscow on
6 September inviting him to an Intourist conference in
Moscow from-24-29 October. He had immediately thought
of informing the Embassy, but because of the pressure
of business simply hadn't gotten around to it. When
Lautz called him, he knew immediately what we were
interested in.

b) He had prepared a Xerox copy of the telegram.
for us, which he gave to me. He has not yet definitely
made up his mind about attending the conference, but
thinks he probably will go. At the moment, he was still
awaiting the detailed letter on the conference which,
according to the telegram, was to follow. (LICOZY-5 has
already received his letter.) In reply to my question
as to whether he was sending enough people to the USSR
to make the trip really worthwhile, he said that he
had sent only five people there so far this year, but
that he thought travel to the Soviet Union was definitely
going to pick up. He said that LOGINOV who has been
the Soviet official he has been dealing with about visas,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

to Moscow could consequently be made at relatively little
additional expense.

c) Subject continued that if he did go to Moscow,
he would be glad to submit a report on his trip when he
got back, get (group) pictures, if we wanted them, of
his eyes open. However, he said, as he told Oronsky, he
is not interested in working for us on a permanent basis,
meeting clandestinely with us, or taking any money. was
willing to help, he explained, because he believed
basically what we did about current world problems and,
after all, had lived in the States for many years and
regarded it as his "second home." He said he liked the
arrangement of meeting in Lautz's office because it made
clandestine meetings unnecessary and because he had a
perfectly legitimate reason for being there.

d) Subject stated that he had already given Lautz
the names of the other travel agents in Mexico whom he
had heard had been invited to Moscow and said that once
he received the Intourist letter giving the details on
the conference he would begin calling around to see
exactly who was going.

3. Since a) Subject had already volunteered to do
   primarily what I intended to ask him, b) had not yet
   definitely decided to make the trip, c) Lautz gave no
   indication of preparing to leave us alone, and d) I
   clearly could not get any farther with Subject on a
   personal level with Lautz present, I brought the meeting
   to an end with a request to see Subject again after he
   had received the Intourist letter, obtained the names of
   those of his colleagues who were going, and decided
   definitely whether or not he was going to go. Subject
   said he would be happy to talk with me again, get the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

information I wanted, and, if I liked," "be briefed"
on the trip. It was agreed he would call Lautz to set
up the meeting. (The situation was such that I do not
blame Lautz for apparently thinking it unnecessary to
leave us alone this time, but I made a special point
of requesting that he leave us to ourselves next time.
Lautz, who seems to be thoroughly friendly and accommodating,
readily agreed.)

4. Subject impresses me as a very sharp, shrewd,
   cool-headed, but probably basically sincere individual.
   He had the situation figured perfectly when he arrived
   in Lautz's office, had decided precisely what he would
   be willing to do, knew exactly what he was going to say,
   and wasted no words in saying it. I plan to try to get
   to know him a little better next time, give him a defensive
   briefing as well as one on what to keep his eyes open
   for, and also explore his attitude toward a possible
   recruitment pitch from the Soviets. (Prior to his trip
   to the USSR in May 1963, Subject agreed to accept Soviet
   recruitment if approached and to serve as a DA. Upon
   his return, however, he reported that the Soviets made
   no approach to him.) I also want to ask him about LOGINOV,
   on whom he agreed to supply personality data
   to Oronsky, but evidently never did. Subject mentioned
   that LOGINOV had told him about ten days ago that he
   had been promoted to Consul. Subject did not say if
   he had been in touch with LOGINOV or anyone else at the
   Soviet Embassy about the Intourist conference. I will
   get this from him next time.

5. Subject told Lautz that the following individuals
   had been invited to the Intourist conference:

(a) Moises Schuster of Nundos Tours.

(b) Carlos IBARGUEN of De Carlo Tours (IBARGUEN
is also the president of the Mexican Travel Agents' Assoc.).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

(c) Someone from the Garza Travel Service. Subject also gave me an Air France tourist pamphlet on the USSR in Spanish for my information.

6. Subject mentioned in passing that he would be glad to furnish us (presumably on a regular basis) with the names of those people who book travel to the Soviet Union through his Agency, but said Oronsky had previously shown disinterest in such information. In view of Oronsky's alleged disinterest, I let the subject pass without comment, but I see no reason not take up his offer. Besides furnishing us with a few more names, it would give us a reason for continuing contact with Subject.

# PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1.  This is a new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ III) which has been in use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.

2.  For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been developing a system for indirect assessment of target personalities. The system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such observations are used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the. profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The goal of the assessment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.

3.  Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact, it is a rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking. Mark such items with a "G," instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, an observer with very limited contact can be expected to enter more "G's" than "X's."

9.02.19 Is there anything about his eating habits or manners that requires special mention ? If so, please describe:

9.03 Overall impression of eating and smoking behavior. (Check the most appropriate description.)

9.03.01 A hearty eater with well-defined preferences. He eats and smakes with considerable gu gusto but tends to be a little on the coarse and boorish side. It is rather easy to imagine him eating huge sandwiches and drinking beer with the boys at the neighborhood bar.

9.03.02 A heavy eater with limited preferences. He eats and smokes with gusto but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish. It is rather easy to imagine him becoming quite sharp with a waiter who serves him unfamiliar fond or a dish prepared in än unfamiliar way.

9.03.03 A sensual eater who knows all the restaurants and their native specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he has discovered. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors-his smokes, and though rarely gauche, he is more aware of his food than his manners. It is easy to imagine him cooking and serving special dishes to his friends.

-24-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 247

9.03.04 A sensual eater who tends to eat by himself when possible... He seems to eat all types of food and has something of the air of a glutton about him. He eats with obvicus pleasure, savors his smokes and afterwards will linger alone at a table with self-satisfaction. It is easy to imagine him hovering alone over the buffet at a cocktail party savoring the tidbits.

9.03.05 A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd. He probably has food allergies that prevent him from eating certain foods. He gives the impression. of enjoying smoking more than eating but his table manners are adapted to what-ever situation he is in. It is easy to imagine him taking an indigestion pill in the privacy of his room.

9.03.06 A conventional eater who always goes along with the crowd. He eats with little relish and rarely mentions anything about his likes or dislikes. He smokes at every opportunity, but more mechanically than with pleasure. He usually tries to adapt his manners to the situation but may be a little awkward and obvious in doing so. It is easy to imagine him grabbing a bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.

9.03.07 A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated food tastes. Dining is quite a ritual with him, and atmo sphere and service are almost as important as the food. He is graceful and cultured at table and smokes in the same manner. It is easy to imagine him dressing for dinner, en-joying fine wines and food by candlelight.

9.03.08 An unconventional eater, a man who "eats like a bird." He eats in a preoccupied way, obviously, indifferent to his food and surroundings. It would not be surprising to learn he was a food faddist (vegetarian, health foods, etc.).

9.03.09 None of these descriptions really fit, I would describe him as:

9.04.20 Is there anything special about his drinking habits that requires mention? If so, please describe:

9.05 Overall impression of drinking behavior: (Check the most appropriate)

9.05.01 A hearty, heavy drinker who holds his liquor well. He is always rather boisterous, and when he drinks, there is little change in behavior.

9.05:02- A heavy drinker who often gives the impression he can drink others under the table. When he drinks, there is little change in behavior, but there is a hint that he could get quite mean if provoked.

9.05.03 A steady drinker who obviously enjoys being "tight." In a way he can be somewhat charming when drunk and can get away with a bit of the "life of the party" routine..

9.05.04 A steady drinker who becomes somewhat more maudlin when drunk or tight. Tends to tell people how much he likes them and sometimes asks others whether they like him. Gives an impression that he could become quite disgusting if he got very drunk.

-28-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 251

9.05.05 A steady drinker who holds his liquor very well. He always remains quite dignified and usually maintains his poise even though others are becoming quite drunk or tight. He still remains part of the crowd, however-that is, he gives few signs of being disgusted or bored.

9.05.06 A light drinker who paces his drinks. He seems to drink only because it is socially necessary. As a party progresses he tends to become aloof and distant. Is likely to continue to talk about his work even when it is inappropriate.

9.05.07 A light drinker who tapers off as the evening progresses. Usually manages to keep a sophisticated aloofness from others. Often singles out and associates with someone rather like himself. As the party progresses, he shows obvious distaste for anything he considers crude or boisterous. Often becomes quite sarcastic about others' behavior.

9.05.08 A very light drinker who either drinks only because he has to or refuses to drink at all. Is usually not really a part of the party and is obviously annoyed when others bring him in against his wishes. Tends to be solitary and sometimes will leave unobtrusively when the opportunity presents.


9.05.09 None of these descriptions really fit. I would describe him as:

10.02.08 Is there anything unusual or striking about his gait or manner
of walking? If so, please describe:

10.03 Overall Impression of driving and walking behavior:
(Check the most appropriate description.)

10.03.01 An active, alert individual with a purposeful stride who appears
to have a very practical mind. He enjoys "fixing things," ap-
pears to have sound knowledge of automobiles, and drives in a
relaxed efficient manner.

10.03.02 An active individual who is somewhat standoffish (or negative)
toward others. His stride is fast and intent. He appears to
have a practical mind, is quite possessive and protective and
is reluctant to share his possessions with others. He "fixes
things" in a matter-of-fact way, appears to have good know-
ledge of automobiles, and drives in a determined (sometimes
even hostile) but efficient manner.

10.03.03 An active, alert individual with a free-and-easy stride who
appears most of the time to be in good humor. Seldom tries
to fix things, but is often quite good at getting others to fix
things for him. He appears to have little knowledge of auto-
mobiles but drives in a relaxed, efficient manner.

10.03.04 An active individual who has a cautious tinge to his walk as
though he is easily embarrassed or easily startled. He appears
rather helpless and awkward when he has to "fix things." He
evidently has little knowledge of automobiles and drives in a
careful (sometimes tense) but efficient manner.

10.03.05 A well-controlled and attentive individual who walks in
something of a clipped, formal manner. Although generally
practical, he seldom will do anything by "feel." He must
read up and prepare himself when required to "fix things."
He appears to have acquired considerable knowledge about
automobiles but drives in a somewhat mechanical or highly
controlled manner.

10.03.06 A well-controlled individual who is often somewhat preoccu-
pied even in his walk. When he takes time to "fix things" he
does so with intensity and precision. He is often very well
read about automobiles and cares for his car or sees that it is
cared for meticulously. However, when involved in conver-

-32-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 255

10.03.07 sation or otherwise preoccupied, he can sometimes be quite
a dangerous driver.

10.03.08 A well-controlled individual who has a glide (or grace) in his walk. He has little or no interest in "fixing things" but usually knows the best places to get things done and is inclined to be quite particular in how things are done for him. He appears to have relatively little knowledge of the mechanics of an automobile, but appreciates and takes good care of a good automobile. He drives with confidence, but usually at a fast pace with not too much awareness of others.

10.03.08 A rather nervous and temperamental person who walks rap- idly and rather awkwardly. He has little or no interest in "fixing things" and is inclined to ignore or throw away things that do not work. He appears to have little interest in or knowledge about automobiles and his driving shows it. It is sometimes frightening to ride with him.

10.03.09 None of these descriptions really fit.
I would describe him as:

11.01.05 Have you ever seen him lose his temper? No Yes
If Yes, give a short description of the inciderit, including
how he reacted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 262

11.02. Humor:

11.02.01 Is he a person whom you

Consider his tendency to tease like that of most people ☑

11.02.02 Is he a person

11.02:06 Is he more inclined to tell a story

To a group of people ✗
Quietly to a friend or acquaintance
Only when encouraged

11.03 Overall impression of temperament and sense of humor:
(Check the most appropriate description.)

11.03.01 He is is a hearty, hale fellow who laughs with gusto and pleasure. His humor is forthright, not subtle, and although he is sometimes loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the tirne, his good humor is contagious.

11.03.02 He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with considerable gusto. However, he is frequently dour and sometimes. intolerant and somewhat humorless. His humor is direct, even crude, and at times, inappropriate. He tends to be the kind of person who laughs more at people than with people. X


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 263

11.03.03 He is a good-humored fellow who sometimes can be considered jolly and carefree. His humor is clever and well timed. He is quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often can do a good job appropriately livening up a party. Although something of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.

11.03.04 He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person who, at times, can be surprisingly gay and carefree. However, when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and causes some strain for those around him. His humor is often cleyer but he can be quite sarcastic and even biting on occasion.

11.03.05 He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appropriate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless person, but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes difficult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.

11.03.06 He is a dour and humorless person, always serious and intense. It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not responsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.

11.03.07 He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow with a subtle wit. He can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting. However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his sense of humor and he can be quite condescending towards people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor.

11.03.08 He is an arty, somewhat cynical person who can be quite flippant at times. His humor tends to be a bit far out. He seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates. It is sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing or subtly hostile.

11.03.09 None of these fit. I would describe him as:

No
If Yes, what did she say?

athletic, virile, manly.

12.02 Overall impression: Which of the following best describes him?

12.02.01 He is an earthy, lusty man who shows little embarrassment about
sex. He treats women appropriately, but makes little effort to
conceal his admiration and attraction. He appears virile and
self-confident with women, and most women seem to like it. ✗

12.02.02 He is an earthy, lusty man who on occasion can be crude or
even vulgar. He treats women rather harshly, und can become
quite pushy when attracted to a woman. He seems to be very
proud of his virility. Many women would be offended or re-
buffed by his aggressiveness, but this does not seem to bother
him.

-43-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 266

12.02.03 He is a somewhat sensual, rather soft man who is very consid-
erate of women. He is prone to hold a woman's hand overly
long when talking to her and frequently puts his arms around
women he admires. He often uses flattery and compliments
but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his
attentiveness.

12.02.04 He is a sensual person, but is embarrassed and insecure about
it. He is a rather soft man who tries hard to be inoffensive.
However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his
eyes when he thinks no one is looking. He is also prone to
brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets
a chance.

12.02.05 He is a self-confident, rather polished person who is proper
and conventional with either men or women. He is always
considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to
ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.
In a group, he always behaves according to protocol and
usually can be quite efficient in doing so.

12.02.06 He is a self-confident and precise person who has something
of the air of a professional man about him. He is polite,
almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to
light a woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken
care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in
his relations with women. Sometimes his formality is out
of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners
or procedures to fit the situation.

12.02.07 He is a charming, urbane person and both friendly and
sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way
but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness.
He is neat, even dapper, and can be quite fastidious.
Most of his relations with women appear to be quite pla-
tonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several
very close friends who are women.

12.02.08 He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom some
people consider odd or unusual. He shows little or no
interest in women in public. In general, he is a preoc-
cupied person who only seeks out people with similar
interests. There is an ascetic, asexual air about him
most of the time.

12.02.09 None of these fit. I would describe him as:

VI. IDEOLOGICAL SET

15. General

15.01 In general:

He is a man with forthright and obvious opinions. He is capable of expressing these opinions with little apparent regard for the feelings and attitudes of others.

He is a man with many prejudices and dogmatic ideas. He can express them with heat and determination when necessary.

8 Dec 1300- 1345, Sus office

8 December 1966

1. The C/O arrived at Sudj's office while Sudj was on his way down to the street to meet Valentin Logines who had called by phone to ask Sudj to step down to the street. It turned out that all Loginor was interested in us to stre Sudj two tickets for the Ballet for 9 December. Loginov jokingly asked Sudj if he had gone to the passing of the two presidents at the border- and Sudj rejoined that he didn't make that meeting but would be on hand for the turning over of the Charizal. /Comment: the C/O was not aware of any Soviet iditering about as he entered Sudj's building.

2. Sudj reported that Alexandr Frikhodko had dropped in to the office unexpectedly on 39 Dec, but was prevented from talking to Subj because Subj's wife and son were there. Prikhodko asked when he could have lunch with Subj, and-Sudj told him to call nax: week, but that he was terribly busy during the Christmas rush.

The C/O took the opportunity to impress on Subj again that he was to do nothing, absolutely nothing, for the Soviets. Even if the Soviets only wanted to know about changed visa requirements for travel in Latin America - Subj was not to give them the time of day.

3. The C/O brought up the subject of Jacobo Zabludovsky's mention to Subj of Echarerrid's interest in enlisting the support of influential Jews in his bid for the Presidency, and asked if Subj had heard anything further on this.

Sudj said "no."

But he related the story again for the C/O:

Back in October 1965 Echevarria was attending a conference at which Subj was present. Echevarria came down off the presidium directly to Subj's table and greeted him.

Subj related this to Zabludovsky, and it was then that Zabludovsky told Subj that Echevarria had spoken to him and said he feels he is a strong candidate for the Presidency, and would like to have a committee of five people in the Jewish community to coordinate with him. Zabludovsky told Subj he was intending to propose Sudj. Zabludovsky did not name any others.

The C/O asked Subj who he thought some of the other likely Jewish leaders might be. Subj said it was hard to say, but he named two: Vickay Feldman, a banker and Fernando Jena, the head of Binal B'rith.

The C/O asked Subj to check with Zabludovsky on the whole matter again, when he had the opportunity. Subj said he would do so.

4. Sulj is intending to take a two day trip to Colombia, either 9 or 10 Dec, in connection with the petroleum Congress.

22 December 1966

1.  The C/O dropped by Subj's office on 22 Dec, after having delivered a Christmas gift of liquor to Subj's home the previous day. Subj was very appreciative of the gift.

2.  Subj showed the C/O the reservation card for travel of Soviet Georgi Vlako and his family, Nina, Irina and Larina. They're booked for departure from Mexico for 25 Dec by Air France, for Paris. Paris to Brussels, where Visko has four days of business, and continuing flight Brussels to Moscow on 30 December. Visko had visited Subj in company with another Soviet who Subj was told was Visko's successor: (from the latter's card) - Victor M. Ivanov, Consejero Comerdal de la Embajada Sovietica.

3.  Subj stated that he had received a letter from Sidney Weintraub, U.S. State Department official now in Chile, inviting Subj to visit him. /Comment: Weintraub formerly stationed in Mexico and later in Washington was the subject of interest by the Soviets in Mexico, who had Subj try to maintain contact on his Washington trips/. Please forward this information to Gerald F. Gestetner in Santiago.

4.  Subj said he had received a firm invitation from Mr. Hawkins (phonetic), Mgr. of Air France In Mexico, to go on the inaugural flight of Air France to Red China, possibly in April 1967. Subj was completely neutral about his going, but asked the C/O if we had any interest in his taking the trip to Red China. The C/O said we would let him know about that.

5.  The C/O asked Subj to have the door to his office closed, so that wo might discuss a serious matter. The C/O said he wanted to explore frankly the status of Subj's relationship toward the Soviets. The C/O stated, bluntly that there was a feeling "higher up" that Subj had not achieved a sufficient degree of cut-off from the Soviets, and that his posture of friendly compromise weakened his stance. In reply, Subj mentioned the two elements that went into his attitude toward the Soviets:

a) re the financial gain from associating with them, Subj said that had fallen to such an insignificant level that it had no effect in his dealings with the Soviets. And he said that level would sink even more when the Soviets inaugurate Aeroflot flights from Montreal and New York (the Soviets do not handle bookings on Aeroflot through agents).

b) his personality (the C/O had asked if it were possible for Subj to become cool or even unfriendly toward the Soviets); Subj said he could not change its personality. In the past year he had cooled off noticeably, having resisted all cooperation with them, avoided them, put difficulties in the way of meetings, etc. But it was against his grain to de unfriendly toward people with whom he might be thrown into association. He cited proudly that he was not beholden to the Soviets for anything, and never went out of his way to seek anything from them; for instance, he had been told that Pavel Yatskov had brought back caviar for Subj on his return from the Soviet Union - but Subj made no move to call Yatskov (when and if Yatskov calls him, he will see him and cannot understand how he could be unfriendly to Yatskov under such circumstances).

6.  The C/O mentioned to Subj the latter's equivocal reply of "maybe" when Loginov had asked if Subj would report the name of the CIA chief in Mexico if he knew it. Subj replied that he had told Loginov that the latter was crazy

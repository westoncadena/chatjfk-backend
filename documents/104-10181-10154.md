MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Two MVD Officers in Minsk Who Are Engaged in the Surveillance of Foreigners

SOURCE: (201-0948382). A foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in various jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1969-76

DATE OF INTERVIEW : 26-28 April 1977

1. The two MVD officers described in this report are part of a small (and otherwise unidentified) section of the Minsk City Internal Affairs Directorate (GUVD) on Dobromyshlenskiy pereulok (the subject of a separate report). This section is engaged in the surveillance of foreigners for the apparent purpose of identifying those of their Soviet contacts who may be black marketeers.

2. KOVALEV, Vladimir, whose nickname is "Boni", holds the rank of senior lieutenant. Born in about 1949, he is 174 cm tall, of medium build, and has slightly wavy short blond hair. He is very nearsighted and wears glasses. He dresses modestly and inconspicuously and has the appearance of an "educated and cultured" person.

3. KOVALEV is married to Tamara nee MATVEYEVA, and they have a son, born in about 1972, who attends a special kindergarden for the children of high-ranking and other privileged officials. KOVALEVA, the daughter of a retired KGB lieutenant colonel, is a graduate of an economics institute and works as a senior economist for the State Committee for Standards, earning 170 rubles per month. The KOVALEVS live on Bobruyskaya ulitsa directly opposite a bus station.

4. KOVALEV is a graduate of the Minsk State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages, where he studied Spanish and English in the Department of Translating. After graduation, KOVALEV left Minsk for one year to go into the Army. However, Source found this hard to believe, as he knew that KOVALEY had been turned down for military service in 1966 because of nearsightedness. During the time that KOVALEV was in the Army, his wife told Source that where her husband was serving "they put army boots on once a month, just for show." KOVALEV'S military service card (*voyennyy bilet*) nevertheless indicates both his 1966 rejection and the year that he supposedly spent in the Army.

5. Source believes KOVALEV's father-in-law was instrumental

in his choice of a career and probably helped KOVALEV through his own connections. (Fnu MATVEYEV, the father-in-law, had once been an important KGB official in the Belorussian SSR.) Source also believes that KOVALEV, while he is an MVD officer, has close ties with the KGB and may have been co-opted by ft. He bases this belief on KOVALEV's close and frequent association with Anatoliy AKSENOV, a KGB lieutenant (the subject of a separate report). The Yubileynaya, a hotel where foreigners stay, is apparently one of KOVALEV's assignments, as he is frequently seen there.

6. (Fnu) PINYAZ' is the MVD officer who works with KOVALEV. Born in about 1945, PINYAZ' is of average height and build, has short blond hair, gray eyes, and dresses'simply in an apparent effort to be inconspicuous. During a drinking session, PINYAZ' admitted to Source that he “cooperates closely" with the KGB. PINYAZ' is frequently seen at the Hotel Turist.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SX-32439
8 September 1977

SUBJECT: Organization, Functions, and Personalities of the MVD in Minsk

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in various jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1969-76

DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

1. The headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) of the Belorussian SSR is on the corner of prospekt Lenina and ulitsa Uritskogo in Minsk. The Minister is General-leytenant KLIMOVSKIY. He is married and has two daughters, both of whom studied in foreign languages at the Belorussian State University.

2. There is an MVD militia unit, called an internal affairs section (otdel vnutrennikh del, OVD), in each of the six rayons (precincts) of Minsk, as follows:

A. Frunze Rayon OVD, on Obuz'naya ulitsa.

B. Tsentral'nyy Rayon OVD, on the corner of Respubli-kanskaya ulitsa and Komsomol'skaya ulitsa.

C. Sovet Rayon OVD, on Ploshchad' Ya.Kolasa.

D. Oktyabr' Rayon OVD.

E. Lenin Rayon OVD, at Serebryanka Mikro-rayon.

F. Zavod Rayon OVD, on Partizanskiy prospekt.

3. Each of these rayon OVDs (known as ROVD) consists of the following departments (otdeleniye):

A. Investigations Department (Sledstvennoye otdeleniye). the largest component of the ROVD, conducts investigations of all crimes committed within the boundaries of the rayon. According to Source, the best educated and most highly trained investigators and inspectors at the militia are to be found.

in this department. In the Frunze ROVU, Inspectors Aleksandr GLYDOVSKIY and Vladimir MELESHKO were friends of Source, whc.
stated that both men have anti-Soviet leanings. An MVD major,
Vladimir KOMAROVICH, investigates the most serious cases.

B. The Department for Combatting the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation (OBKhSS) is concerned with protecting socialist property in state establishments such as stores, plants and factories, hotels and restaurants. The following OBKhSS personalities were known to Source: (fnu) MALYSHKO and (fnu) POLYANSKIY in the Frunze ROVD, (fnu) KELLER and (fnu) VYSOTSKIY in the Tsentral'nyy ROVD, and (fnu) SUCHKOV in the Oktyabr' ROVD.

C. Department for Combatting Parasitism (Otdel bor'by s tuneyadstvom). Source thought that the term "parasitism (tuneyadstvo) had recently been removed from the USSR Criminal Code and replaced by "vagrancy, begging and other parasitic types of existence." But the official procedures remain the same. Soviet citizens not engaged in socially productive labor are first given a warning, which they must sign at the department. If they remain unemployed, their case is turned over to a court, and the offense is punishable by a sentence of up to two years. However, there are ways to get around the law. Source says that if it can be shown that parents or a spouse are providing support or if a person can get seasonal work, he can defend himself before the department. But most citizens are not aware of these loopholes, according to Source. After the Investigations Department, this militia department turns over the greatest number of citizens to the courts. Also, this department and the law that it enforces are frequently used against dissidents.

D. Passport Department. Employees of this department make entires in the internal passports of citizens regarding their place of residence, and this department therefore gets many visitors. The department also enforces passport regulations.

E. The Guards and Protection (Okhrana) Department is responsible for providing militia protection to special establishments, such as radio and television studios and stations. This department also provides escorts for prisoners and guards at trials.

F. Department of Burglar and Intrusion Alarms (Otdel vnevedomstvennoy okhrany OVO). Source did not have any information on this department except that he thought it provides guards and watchmen for various enterprises in addition to its work with alarm systems.

G. Motor Pool (Motodivizion) provides and maintains patrol cars and motorcycles for the militia.

4. The rayon OVDs (ROVDs) fall under the Minsk City Internal Affairs Directorate (Gorodskoye upravleniye vnutrennikh del, GUVD) of the Executive Committee of the Minsk City Soviet. (fnu) PISKAREV, who holds the rank of general-mayor of internai affairs, is chief of the Minsk GUVD. The GUVD, which is on Dobromyshlenskiy pereulok, houses the pretrial detention cell (kamera predvaritel'nogo zaklyucheniya, KPZ and OVIR). Even though the Minsk city OVIR falls under the Belorussian Republic OVIR, there is no republic-level OVIR office in Minsk, although there are some republic-level OVIR officials who sit in the MVD headquarters building on prospekt Lenina.

5. Shortly before Source left Minsk to emigrate, he learned of a very small section in the GUVD, consisting of two or three people engaged in the surveillance of foreigners. Of particular interest to this section are the foreigners' contacts with black marketeers (fartsovshchiki). Although Source previous- ly thought that only the KGB was concerned with black marketeers, he concluded that the MVD is also involved and thất the two organizations probably work closely together, both posting their representatives in the hotels where foreigners stay, such as the Turist, the Yubileynaya, and the Minsk. Source knew of two members of this small section, Vladimir KOVALEV and (fnu) PINYAZ' (who are covered in a separate report)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Druzninniki and Operativniki, Voluntary Civilian Militia Patrolmen

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk, who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Heither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1969-76

DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

1. The *druzhina* is a group of civilians who volunteer to assist the militia in maintaining public order. Although the *druzhiny* originated spontaneously in about 1962, they have since become official appendages of the militia. There is at least one *druzhina* in each factory, public and commercial enterprise, institute and technical school. Although the *druzhina* officers are supposedly elected, they actually are appointed by the administration at the factory. A duty roster is posted. Almost everyone except the management has to be on duty at one time or another; no one can refuse. It is very hard to make people, especially the factory workers, roam the streets on *druzhina* duty after a day's work because they would rather go home.

2. In the institutes the *druzhiny* operate this way. After lectures all the students of a particular department have to attend a compulsory meeting. The senior *druzhinnik* of the institute is in charge of the meeting, together with the senior *druzhinniki* and deputies in the departments. Those students who for some reason did not manage to escape this duty (using a medical excuse, influence with the chief, or other means), are then marched to the nearest *druzhina* post. There are dozens of such posts in each *rayon* (precinct) of the militia, usually in the basements of apartment houses. Usually there is an officer of the militia there, with several militiamen of lower ranks.

![CONFIDENTIAL]

3. At the _druzhina_ post, each _druzninnik_ gets a red arm band to wear. Then, they are dispatched to different locations to patrol and uphold public order. What actually happens is that they just walk around the streets for a while, then return the red arm bands and go home. Not all of them, however, just walk around: for any number of reasons (desire to get ahead, anger at the world, or exercise of a little power) some of them grab off the streets either innocent people or obvious drunks and take them to the post. Source himself was taken in several times to such a post. There a militia officer fills out a report, and does not even try to listen to the detained person's explanation of what happened. If you do not try to prove your innocence, the matter will end just with a fine of five to ten rubles and a report to your place of work, which will cause you to lose any bonus pay at work. If you try to argue, to prove your innocence, then the action is more serious. A patrol car that periodically visits each post, picks you up, and takes you to the rayon MVD. There, the militia nolds you all day. In the best case, you have to pay a fine of ten rubles, and in the worst case, you receive fifteen days of confinement with compulsory labor, only if there was nothing criminal in your behavior. If there was, then you get a trial and a jail sentence.

4. If the _druzhinniki_ do not bring anyone in, they are criticized for not doing their job conscientiously. Another reason for pressure on them, in Source's opinion, is that the government needs the money from the fines.

5. Some of the more active _druzhinnik_ are offered jobs in militia after graduation.

6. Source heard about another organization, the _operativniki_, but he does not know the difference between them and the _druzninniki_. It seems that the _operativnik_ are a little higher in rank. They meet in secret, no one announces their meetings, or the names of the members. No one knows or talks about it.

7. In the Institute of Foreign Languages, the chief of the _operativnik_ was Vladimir SHUMRIKOV, born. 1939, about 186 cm. tall, sturdily build, an athlete (former smotputter) who has short wavy hair, dark eyes, large features, and a fairly handsome, but somewhat hard face. He graduated from Illyaz in 1973, speaks Englisin and German, likes to drink, always hangs around the for- eigners at the sport meets. SHU!!RIKOV has been a Party member stace 1973. Source saw him several times with Yevgeniy SURGATOV (KGB) in a Minsk bar. SHUMRIKOV also knows KCB senior lieutenant Anatoliy Alexsandrovich AKSENOV.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Selection and Recruitment of KGB Officers, Agents and Informers in the Belorussian SSR

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-1976

DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

1. Source obtained most of the information in this report from Anatoliy Aleksandrovich AKSENOV, a KGB senior lieutenant who was in charge of the KGB unit in the Yubileynaya Hotel in Minsk, and from friends and classmates who are now KGB and militia officers.

2. Source's curiosity about the selection and recruitment of KGB personnel was aroused when AKSENOV told him that he was considering the recruitment of Source as a KGB informant. Source asked AKSENOV who is selected and for what reasons. AKSENOV replied that the KGB usually uses spotters, who recommend people for recruitment. Background is important. A person from a peasant or worker's family is considered a better choice, and he must either be a quiet and colorless type who blends into the circle of people in which he operates, or else a conspicuous loudmouth who asks embarrassing questions. The latter would be more likely suspect of being a member of the opposition rather than a KGB informant. The average informant, according to AKSENOV, is not very bright because KGB officers themselves are not particularly intelligent and are afraid of anyone who is smarter than they. Source says that he was never recruited.

3. Both Source and AKSENOV think that in the remote areas of the USSR there are very few cases of such a recruitment pitch being turned down. Far from the big cities the KGB is an all-powerful instrument, and anyone who refuses just to report on the conversations of his friends in the name of patriotism will end up with dismal career prospects unless he has friends in high places. However, it is unlikely that such a person would be chosen for a KGB recruitment pitch in the first place. Therefore most of the lower levels of the KGB consist of people from simple backgrounds for whom there are no other career prospects and who prefer this kind of service to being in the Army.

4. The KGB officers in the Belorussian SSR are also those who are not bright enough to make a career in some other field, such as science, engineering, or foreign languages, but they differ from the lower-level cadres in that they are the sons of high-ranking


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

Party and government officials. This is why so many sons of Belorussian dignitaries work for the KGB. Otherwise they would be doomed to jobs which would pay ha, et most, 120 rubles per month for the rest of their lives, even if they could survive the competition in a Party job. In the KGB, an officer, who achieves such status by going through a school, can look forward to steady promotions until he reaches the rank of major And if his sponsor retains his influence, the officer can eventually be promoted to lieutenant colonel or even colonel before retiring. Also, it is a prestigious, interesting, and financially advantageous job which places the KGB officer above the common people to the point where many officers consider themselves to be above the law. Their salaries are often supplemented by discreet cooperation with black marketeers, who pay off either in goods or a percentage of the take. And there are the services of the women who sleep with foreigners for money or for other considerations, and who report to the KGB... So a person like AKSENOV, responsible for a large tourist hotel like the Yubileynaya, actually presides over a small kingdom.

5. A KGB officer meets each of his agents (filer was the word used by Source) in a safe house (konspiratívnaya kvartira). Other officers are not supposed to know who these agents are, and this "conspiracy" is a matter of great pride to them. Source was once caught leaving the hotel room of a Bulgarian girl with whom he had spent the night, but he was released when he gave AKSENOV's name to the junior KGB officer on duty (thereby implying that Source was on assignment for AKSENΟΥ).

6. Source described KGB influence as "overwhelming". For example, a Soviet going abroad on an official assignment cannot refuse to cooperate with the KGB because such refusal would mean that the person wouldn't be able to travel, as the KGB has a say about his final clearance. Source also gave the example of an applicant for an unimportant job with the Minsk Symphony who was originally turned down. But when AKSENOV spoke to the KGB officer responsible for the Symphony, the applicant was not only hired but received the greatest respect from the Symphony Director during the entire period of his employment.

7. The KGB likes to recruit retired military personnel (*otstavniki*) because they are considered politically reliable and patriotic. Many *otstavniki* recruited by the KGB are former *Osobyy otdel* (Special Section, security functions) people, so KGB work is not a novelty for them. Such retirees are frequently used in stationary positions, reporting on or guarding specific areas.

8. Since the KGB relies on spotters for the selection of its agents, the spotters themselves can get into trouble if they recommend the "wrong" person. This means that the spotters are afraid to select clever people, so in the end they select mediocre ones. Selection is determined by the following: If the prospective agent or informer is a *kolkhoznik*, he is immediately 50% qualified. If he was in the Army, particularly in the *Osobyy otdel*, this adds another 30%. Other qualifications are based on the person's being "quiet", "average", or "ordinary".

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

SECRET

9.  The spotter is supposed to turn in a list of potential recruits and write a recommendation for each person. The prospective agent or informer is then called in and an offer to cooperate with the KGB is made. Source never heard anything about money being mentioned, but the KGB does offer help in the advancement of one's career. The initial assignments are very simple: The agent or informer just has to keep his eyes and ears open and to report anything that smacks of anti-government or illegal activity. Who can refuse such a call to patriotic vigilance? And if one does, he might well be classified as an enemy of the state and end up doing the lowliest physical labor rather than enjoying a promising career.

10. AKSENOV also told Source that the KGB usually opens a file on a Soviet citizen who corresponds with anyone abroad. After this, his telephone conversations are monitored and periodically recorded. And finally, KGB agents and informers who come into contact with him will be asked to report on him.

11. Source once asked AKSENOV what the KGB would consider its greatest accomplishment. AKSENOV replied that the discovery of a secret agent (nelegal) would be first on the list, followed by the discovery of an illegal printing press. Without printed matter a revolution cannot take place, according to AKSENOV. Third on the list is the discovery of the illegal possession of a rifled weapon, such as a rifte or pistol. This last item would not be considered particularly important in itself, but a KGB officer can do very well for himself if he plays his cards right. He must time the discovery of the illegal weapon with a public event involving the visit of an important Party or government dignitary. Thus, in the eyes of his superiors, his discovery is tantamount to thwarting an assassination attempt. Any one of the three accomplishments would lead to automatic promotion, a medal, and tenure for life in the KGB.

12. Traces: (SE/SAG/OP routinely uses the following sources in tracing: Soviet GICS, Soviet travel, IP Main Index, OCR and SE/SAG/OP branch index. These traces should not be construed as being extensive or complete and any recipients of this report with an active interest in any of the subjects should run full traces of their own.)

There are no Headquarters traces on Anatoliy Aleksandrovich AKSENOV (para 1).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Keeping of Large Sums of Money in the Soviet Union

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-76

DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

1. Unless you have iron-clad proof that you got the money legally, the balance of your account in any one savings bank (sberkassa) should not exceed a thousand rubles. Each savings bank has a militia representative who reports suspiciously large accounts to the OBKhSS (Department for Combatting the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation) of the militia for investigation. Source got this information from a militia lieutenant who was an OBKhSS officer in his rayon.

2. Since savings banks do not have a centralized accounting system, another way of keeping large amounts of money is to have accounts in several banks, as long as none of them exceeds the thousand-ruble limit.

3. One of the best ways of keeping money when traveling, or even at home, is in the form of an *akkreditiv* (a personalized cashier's check). An *akkreditiv* can be bought at any bank or savings institution and can be cashed anywhere at any time but only by the person to whom it is made out and only on presentation of an internal passport. Without the passport, the *akkreditiv* cannot be cashed, thereby making it a safer form of keeping money than currency.

4. If money is to be kept at home, it is somewhat less suspicious to have it in the form of three-percent government loan bonds *(trekhprotsentnyy zaem)*. These are not personalized and can be cashed at any time at a small discount. They also have the advantage of a prize that can be won at one of the periodic drawings based on their numbers.

Members of INYAZ who travel abroad are:

1972-74 He worked with a sound and public address system at the Belorussian State University.

1974-76 He was a street photographer at the Outside (vyyezdnoye) Bureau of the Minsk Factory for Photographic Work.

1976-departure He had miscellaneous employment.

8. RESIDENCE IN THE USSR: From before 1966 to his emigration, UZLOV lived at 47 Volgogradskaya ulitsa in Minsk.

9. EMIGRATION: UZLOV emigrated from the USSR on 28 November 1976. He arrived in Rome shortly thereafter, and departed for the United States on 22 March 1977.

10. PRESENT SITUATION: UZLOV currently lives at 414 Avenue N, apartment 6B in Brooklyn, NY 11230. He is unemployed.

11. PERSONAL EVALUATION: UZLOV is a smart, witty, outgoing, aggressive person, accustomed to living by his wits. He is willing to take chances and play roles, but, at the same time, he is not afraid of hard work, as long as it pays well. He is somewhat given to romanticizing, for example, by seeking a job in intelligence and not fully realizing that it is a steady and, often, dull job. He is not persistent, not able to stick to his studies or hold a job; instead, he prefers to work hard for shorter periods to earn money, and then do nothing.

UZLOV seemed to be completely won over by the United States, saying that he is willing to do anything that would be asked of him, such as his voluntarily bringing in photographs of some of the personalities he described, and suggesting that he would try to use the loose code system that he had established with his friends back in Minsk to obtain information for us, if we so require. At the last possible moment, he admitted that he was incarcerated in the USSR for participation in a fight, but was later found innocent by a higher court.

Physically, UZLOV is good-looking, trim, athletic, and is a former boxer, who trys to keep himself in good shape. He likes to dress well and, seemingly, no longer drinks to excess, as he used to do in the Soviet Union.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: KGB presence in a tourist hotel in Minsk

SOURCE: (201-0948382) A foreign language student from Minsk, who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-76

DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

1. Most of this information was obtained from Anatoliy Aleksandrovich AKSENOV, a senior lieutenant of the KGB, and other friends and classmates of Source who are at present KGB and militia officers. AKSENOV was at that time in charge of the KGB unit in the Yubileynaya Hotel, Minsk.

2. In each tourist hotel in Minsk there is a so-called militia punkt (unit). It is usually in a room on the first floor of the hotel somewhere off the lobby. Supposedly this is a militia unit whose purpose is to protect foreigners, maintain order in the hotel, and prevent black-marketing. Actually, this unit is manned by KGB representatives in militia uniforms who carry militia as well as KGB identification. The militia seems to be the favorite cover for the KGB.

3. In the Yubileynaya Hotel this unit always had four or five persons on duty. During the day it had two privates and a sergeant in uniform and two officers in civilian attire. At night, when on duty, all of them usually wore militia uniforms. Aside from the above-mentioned militia functions, their actual mission was to prevent what they considered to be unnecessary contact of Soviet citizens with foreigners, to observe any suspicious actions by either, and to ensure that only approved persons had access to the hotel. All other Soviet citizens would be stopped, their documents checked, and their business questioned. An officer from such a unit once stopped Source after he had spent the night with a Bulgarian girl in the hotel. Source thinks he was discovered through audio surveillance.

CONFIDENTIAL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

This officer showed his militia identification, and asked for and checked Source's documentation by telephone. He released Source without making any report, because Source, by veiled references to AKSENCV, managed to make this officer believe he was AKSENOV's agent. Later Source learned that this officer was AKSENOV'S KGB subordinate.

4. The KGB also has an audio surveillance room and possibly several saferooms in the hotel. Once in 1975, after drinking with Source for several hours in a restaurant, AKSENOV invited him to come to the "special place" in the Yubileynaya Hotel. Source thinks that AKSENOV probably telephoned before going to the Yubileynaya. Source was led through a number of corridors to a room in the back of the hotel which AKSENOV unlocked with a key. There was no one in the room, although AKSENOV later told Source that there are supposed to be two people on duty at all times. AKSENOV and Source continued drinking in the room. Source did not pay too much attention to detalls, but at one point, apparently in order to impress Source with KGB capabilities, AKSENOV showed the Source a tape recorder, which was of foreign or Baltic republic make, and let him listen through the earphones to what was being recorded from a room under surveillance. Source claimed that he could hear all the sounds in the room, that of running water, etc. AKSENOV switched from room to room; audio quality was uniformly good. AKSENOV later explained that this is the audio surveillance room (komnata proslushivaniya) and that the KGB is capable of listening in to any room in the hotel. A log using notations in code (according to Source's best recol- lection) is kept indicating the time periods of listening in on each room, and the conversations actually recorded. Source was unable to recall whether there was more than one tape récorder in the room or how one recorded segment was distinguished from another on the tapes. He presumed that it was done by voice announcement, but he did not remember seeing a microphone which would be used for this purpose. None of these technical details were explained either then or later by AKSENOV.

5. AKSENOV never mentioned any phone surveillance and Source presumed that this is done in a different location, outside the hotel.

6. In subsequent conversations, AKSENOV told Source that all rooms occupied by foreigners are listened to by a spot check from the time that the occupant enters his room. There is apparently a device which indicates when this occurs. The running of water as an audio hindrance is a useless measure, AKSENOV said, as KGB audio technicians are able to eliminate this as well as many other extraneous noises in order to make the conversations audible.

7. Later Source learned (he does not remember from whom) that telephones are also used as audio listening devices and that they are effective even without the receiver being taken off the hook (i.e., hot mike).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: KGB Personalities in the Minsk area

SOURCE : (201-0948382) a foreign language student from Minsk who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR. Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his bona fides nor his reporting re- liability has been established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-76.

DATE OF INTERVIEW : 26-28 April 1977

The following is in response to a requirement by SE/CI/I on 6 April 1977.

1. The KGB building in Minsk is on Leninskiy pros- pekt. There is another entrance at ulitsa Volodarskogo 2. The building occupies an entire city block and has its own prison within this area.

When conversing, he has the habit of looking downward and then suddenly raising his eyes to look up. Source does not consider him to be particularly intelligent but rather as having a "crafty, peasant approach to life."

A. AKSENOV is the son of Aleksandr Ilikiforovich AKSENOV, a member of the Central Committee and Second Secre- tary of the Belorussian CP. This makes the father the second highest ranking Party official in the Belorussian SSR. He has been characterized as a ruthless careerist. The mother is a physician who no longer practices.

The father nad wanted Anatoliy to marry the daughter of another mem- ber of the Belorussian CC, Aleksey Alekseyevich SMIRNOV, and this nas caused much conflict between father and son, in addition to that already generated by the son's heavy drinking and his frequently getting into trouble when urunk. AKSENOV is afraid of his father. In order to curry favor with her father-in-law, AKSENOV's wife reports episodes of her husband's drunken behavior to him. The younger AKSLOVS fight frequently and separate from time to time; at the time of the source's departure they were living apart. The wife is materialistic and takes advantage of her husband's position. She deals frequently on the black market.

struction engineer, he has been to Iran but now works in Mos-

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Graduates of the Minsk State Pedagogical Institute
of Foreign Languages who travel abroad or who are
disaffected.

SOURCE: (201-0948382), a foreign-language student from Minsk
who worked in numerous jobs throughout the USSR.
Born in 1949, he emigrated in 1976. Neither his
bona fides nor his reporting reliability has been
established.

DATE OF INFORMATION: 1972-76

DATE OF INTERVIEW: 26-28 April 1977

DOC. MICRO. SER.
JUN 14 1977
MICROFILMED.

The following is in response to a requirement levied by
SE/X/AF on 11 April 1977 and SE/CI/X on 12 April 1977.

1. CHADLIYEV, Anatoliy pnu. Born in 1949 or 1950. He
   is 176 cm. tall, of medium build, has short red hair, full
   lips, protruding eyes, freckles. He is single. He does not
   drink or smoke and is very reserved. In 1973, he graduated..
   from the Institute, having studied in the English Department..
   He spent two years in Burma and since 1975 has been in Guinea
   as a contract interpreter.

2. DAVIDOVICH, Aleksandr pnu. Born in about 1948 in
   Minsk, he is 178 cm. tall, thin, has narrow shoulders, light
   hair, grayish blue eyes, full lips, and a large head. He likes.
   to dress well and is considered by Source to be good-looking.
   He gesticulates when talking, he drinks and is an ardent card
   player. He likes women.

A. DAVIDOVICH's father is a colonel in the Personnel
Department of the KGB in Minsk. His mother is a physician.
During his school days, DAVIDOVICH got into trouble with the
militia when he was caught, along with two other students,
stealing a private car. But the matter was settled out of
court, and DAVIDOVICH's only punishment was a reprimand at a
Komsomol meeting.

B. DAVIDOVICH left the Institute in 1971 to go to Algiers for two years, before taking his final examinations, but returned after one year to take these exams and to graduate. He speaks French, English and German.

C. In 1972, he married Nataliya (maiden name unknown), who is from Yevpatoria (in the Crimea), and is a graduate of the French Department of the Institute. In 1972, he also entered the Army but was discharged by a commission three months later due to a nervous disorder. To an ordinary person this would mean never being able to go abroad again. But in 1975, Source heard that DAVIDOVICH was in fact leaving the country again, with his wife, going possibly to Guinea or to Ghana. When asked how he managed this despite his record of illness, DAVIDOVICH told Source that his medical problem was curable and that he was now well. Source thinks that DAVIDOVICH is most likely working for the KGB, at least as a co-opted agent.

3. FISHMAN, Yakov Iosifovich. Born in about 1950. He was a neighbor of Source for 15 years. FISHMAN's father, Iosif, and a brother live in New York. Two days before Source's departure FISHMAN asked him to transmit the following information to authorities in the West. In 1973, FISHMAN served as a sergeant (serzhant) in a strategic missile unit 4 kilometers from the poselok (settlement) of Novobelokorovichi, Zhitomir Oblast'. This unit was armed with medium-range strategic rockets targeted against Munich. Twenty-four kilometers from this unit was another battalion with the same type of rockets, targeted against Frankfurt. These units were part of the 82nd Rocket Division of the Vinnitsa "Rocket Army." While assigned to this battalion, FISHMAN traveled to a rocket-connected manufacturing and repair plant at poselok of Kolosov near Minsk, and the poselok of Bataysk in Rostov Oblast'. The pickup points at both of these places were underground. FISHMAN wants to leave the USSR, but when he tried to apply, the officials would not even accept his papers because of his having been in the rocket troops.

4. KOROBOCHKIN, Leonid Ivanovich. Born in about 1943. Graduated from the Institute with Anatoliy Aleksandrovich AKSENOV (KGB operations officer in Minsk and a friend of the Source). KOROBOCHKIN's father, born in 1902, is now a retired Air Force colonel and has been a Party member since 1921. KOROBOCHKIN was in the Army for one year and worked for the Belorussian Philharmonic Symphony for a year. He cannot find a good job but is trying to become a truck driver with the idea of driving the USSR-West European routes and then defecting. KOROBOCHKIN despises the Soviet government and system. He was one of three people, including Source, involved in a plot to

burn down a Party museum in Minsk, but they decided against this, thinking that it would jeopardize their chances of leaving the USSR. Source can communicate with him by pre-arranged code. A photo of KOROBOCHKIN is available in SE/BIO photo file.

5. LAZERKA, Vladimir pnu. Born in 1949 in Minsk. Is a graduate of the Spanish Department of the Institute. His wife's name is Tat'yana, she was his classmate at the Institute. His father is an engineer. After graduating, LAZERKA worked as a dispatcher at the Minsk airport and in 1974 went to Cuba with AEROFLOT.

6. MIKHEDO, Anatoliy pnu. Born in 1948 in Minsk of a Belorussian father and a Jewish mother. Graduated from the French Department of the Institute. He is a very good friend of Source, who considers him well-educated and cultured. MIKHEDO served in an (unknown) African country as a contract interpreter in 1973-75 but is now back in Minsk. He is working as a Sputnik tourist guide in Minsk but is very unhappy and dreams of going abroad again on another contract, though his chances are slim. He has become a heavy drinker. Two photographs of MIKHEDO are available in SE/BIO photo file.

7. MUZKOV, Yuriy pnu. Born in about 1936. He is KORO-BOCHKIN'S (see paragraph 4) half-brother. MUZKOV was a military specialist in the Higher Engineering and Missile Technical School (Vyssheye inzhenerno raketno tekhnicheskoye uchilishche, VIRTU) in the poselok of Uruch'ye near Kalinin. At present he is a lieutenant colonel in one of the Baltic republics, possibly Latvia.

8. MYAGKOV, Valeriy pnu. He is the son of a colonel on the staff of the Belorussian Military District. MYAGKOV and several other students of the Belorussian State University typed and pasted up in prominent places in Minsk about ten paper leaflets proclaiming "Down with Communist tyranny!" The KGB found them out by comparing the characteristics of the type written proclamation with the typewriter samples in their files. MYAGKOV got four years in prison, at least two of which he spent in the KGB prison in Minsk at ulitsa Volodarskogo 2.

9. PETROV, Dmitriy pnu. He is the grandson of a retired Army colonel, and was brought up by a widowed mother. PETROV was born in 1949 in Minsk. He graduated from the French Department of the Institute in 1972. He was a contract interpreter in an (unknown) African country and is now in Minsk. He worked as an interpreter in the economic achievement exhibit in Minsk. Source heard rumors that PETROV will be going abroad again quite soon.

PETUKHOV was in the Army in the Western Ukraine in a restricted zone where some secret units were stationed. He was one of the three participants in the plot to burn down the Party museum (see paragraph 4). PETUKHOV is trying to leave the USSR but has been unsuccessful thus far. The Source can communicate with him by a code based on associations which they have devised.

11. SHOR, Mstislav pnu. Born in about 1936. He is Jewish. He lives at ulitsa 01'shevskogo 9, Minsk. SHOR is a former wrestler; he now works in a radiator factory. He has two sons. SHOR has divorced his wife and applied for an exit visa. He has been a neighbor of Source for many years.

12. TETEKHIN, Sergey pnu: Born in 1949 in Borisov. He is 183 cm. tall, of medium build, and wears glasses. His father is a major general (general-mayor, equivalent to a briga- dier general in the U.S. Army) who lives in Borisov and is commander of a tank unit in the poselok of Pechi. TETEKHIN graduated from the French Department of the Institute in 1972 and spent two years in Uganda. He has now gone to Africa (country unknown) again. A photograph of TETEKHIN is available in SE/BIO photo file.

13. TSIRLIN, Leonid Abramovich. Born in about 1934, he is married, has a son. His address is ulitsa Volgogradskaya 47, Apt. 2. He is a senior economist at the Belorussian Land Reclamation and Water Resources Trust (Trest melioratsii BSSR), ulitsa Kommunista 6, Minsk. He wants very much to go to Israel but is having difficulties because of alimony from his first marriage. TSIRLIN is an anti-communist who has organized a group of 6-7 Jews who meet to study Hebrew, spread the word on emigrating to Israel, explain how to fill out the necessary forms, etc. TSIRLIN approached Source on the day before his departure for the USA and told him about the above, asking him to contact Israeli military and civilian authorities to obtain Zionist literature and possibly to be assigned intelli- gence missions. Source was introduced to TSIRLIN by his neighbor, Mstislav SHOR (see paragraph 11). Source delivered TSIRLIN's request to a Mr. GOREV of the Israeli Embassy in Vienna.

C/SE/X/AF

SUBJECT: OI Requirements for Interviews of Soviet Emigres

REFERENCE: SAG Memo Dated 8 April 1977

1. Reference alerts us to provide OI requirements for SE/SAG/OP's scheduled debriefing of two Soviet emigres--Sergei UZLOV and Boris PALANT. We are keenly interested in what these two persons have to say about the young people who graduated from the French interpreters' faculty and proceeded to posts in Africa, as several of these names are familiar to us as leads. We are even more interested in background and assessment data on the three military instructors TARASENKO, LIPIN, and VOROBEV, who are currently in Africa and of interest to this branch.

2. In addition to straight bio and assessment data, we would like answers to the following:

A. What were the career and personal objectives/goals of these young persons who accepted assignments in Africa? Were they aware of the climactic/sociological/anthropological differences/difficulties they would encounter. in Africa? Did they accept their assignments primarily to save money? Were any of them looking upon their African assignments as a form of "escape" from the Soviet Union? Had any of them ever mentioned suffering.

B. Did the two sources have the opportunity to talk to any Soviet interpreters who had returned from tours in Africa? If so, what did these persons have to say about the climactic/sociological/anthropological problems they had encountered there, and how they handled them? African assignments are particularly difficult for Soviets who do not adapt easily to conditions in Africa. Because this inability to adapt to African conditions is operationally exploitable, we would like to learn as much about it as possible. We would also be interested in what they said about their duties as interpreters.

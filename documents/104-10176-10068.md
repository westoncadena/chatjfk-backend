23. Approximately in July 19 I-1 had a second interview with "Nordicc in the presence of "Jim" and "Enrique."

24. At the special request of the "friends," in September and October 1964 we sent forward reports on the officers of the Revolutionary Armed Porces in the six provinces, including any background data and intoma- tion we had on them. Afterwards, the work of making Summaries of Infor- nation was intensified.

25. During August-September-October 1964 picket lines were formed in front of the airline companies that had fiizats to Mexico, and in front of airports, Mexican tourist agencies, and Hexican Consulates as a pro-1 test against the Mexican Government and its policy with relation to Cuba This was done in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Kiani, wew York and other place in the United States. This was done daily in Miami and New York. On different occasions pickets were placed in front of theaters which were showing Mexican films. in October pickets were placed in Miami and kiam Beach and propaganda was hanced out at the time of the holding of the ASTA (Thirty-fourth World Congress of Travel Agencies).

26. In November 1954 we began to pass information to the "friends" atou the training camps which were being opened in New Jersey to prepare and train people for the invasion of Haiti. We infiltrated sore of our peop into this group and thus kept informed of averything that went on.

27. At the end of 1954 and up to April 1965 we continued to make studies Among them were those on the Cuban Telephone Enterprise, the Department of Port and Coastal Vigilance, censorship of correspondence, Cuban natior al budgets 1954/65, radio programs heard in Cuba.

28. At the request of the "friends" we collaborated in the reception ac. tivities for Juanita CASTRO and obtained the support of the exile organi. zations for rallies organized in Miami and liew York.

29. In December 1964 we organized a great propaganda campaign, mobilizi all the Hasonic lodzes so they would back the proposal of the Masons who were supporting LOPEZ Mateos at the UN.

30. We acted as a support mechanism to the "friends" in the matter con- cerning Hrs. LIPPERT.

31. In the first months of 1965 an attempt was made on three different occasions to carry out Rescue Operation No. 1.

32. During the first months of 1965 we kept informed about the situation in the Dominican Republic and the participation of the Cubans and Domini; cans in the Miami area in what was going on.

33. During this whole period, in view of the division existing among the exiles and of the formation of so many new exile groups, we infiltrated our agents into all the organizations and reported on all the mover of leaders of these groups and their activities, on all their state and action plans. Our aim and purpose was to report everyusing about the movements of the Cubans and the exile groups.

34. During this period we also began carding all our reports for the

# Memorandum

TO : Mrs. Sue Panzer

FROM : Chief, DO Division

SUBJECT: Meeting with Rolando Masferrer

DATE: 18 August 1964

1. In accordance with our conversation, I am sending you the facts as I know them regarding the 7 August meeting in New York City between Rolando Masferrer and Averell Clark.

2. Apparently Masferrer knows Stanley Ross, the Editor of *El Tiempo*, a Spanish-language newspaper published in New York. The office is at 78 Fifth Avenue and the telephone number is WA 4-2750. Possibly Masferrer did not previously know Ross. But at any rate, either on his own or through someone else, he got in touch with him in late July or early August and said that he wanted to be put in touch with an American with an aviation and military background. I do not know too much about Ross at the moment except that he has had considerable Latin American experience and would be a logical person for any Latino to approach. It would be very easy to obtain additional evidence on him if desired.

3. I am attaching for your information a list of the stockholders in *El Tiempo, Inc*, to provide some indication of who is behind Ross. In addition, we have a list of all the senior officers of *El Tiempo*.

4. Ross knew of Clark through the Hitchcocks listed, as you will note, as stockholders. Mrs. Margaret Hitchcock is Clark's aunt, while Thomas Hitchcock III is his first cousin as presumably, is William Hitchcock. During the war Clark was an outstanding fighter pilot, having flown with the RAF through the roughest days of the Battle of Britain, and thereafter chifted to the Americans with whom he flew many missions as a P-47 pilot. He is still in the Air Force Reserve.

5. At Ross's request Clark met Masferrer at the *El Tiempo* office in New York City on 7 August. Ross left the room so that the session was only between Clark and Masferrer. As a pro-Batista Cuban, Masferrer was known to us at the time of the Bay of Pigs. In fact, at one point just before the invasion, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested him and put him in jail in Florida for violation of the provisions of the Neutrality Act.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 6

6. Masferrer alleged to Clark that he was representing some twenty Cuban exile organizations, and that he was working with a Haitian, Charles Forben, head of an anti-Duvalier organization known as "Capois La Mort." Forben allegedly asked Masferrer to help his organization by leasing or buying a PBY-5 aircraft for use against Duvalier. Masferrer claimed that Forben's group was in a position to take control of the Ile de la Gonave.. an island just off the west coast of Haiti in the gulf north of Port au Prince. It is conceivable that this is the wrong island since Clark did not have the name of the islani in question, but based on the description of its location by Masferrer, I am assuming this to be the island involved. At any rate, in return for help from Masferrer, Forben was to be asked to let Masferrer and some of his Cuban exiles use the island in question as a base from which to harrass the eastern end of the Island of Cuba.

7. Clark told Masferrer that as a member of the Air Force Reserve, he would have to report the conversation to the USG and could not do anything without clearing with the USG. Masferrer said that he had no objection to this, particularly with regard to the activities of Forben and his group, but he asked that Clark not mention his intention to harrass Cuba, since he maintained that the USG would forbid this as being against USG policy. Clark said that Masferrer would have to leave to him what matters he chose to discuss with the USG. It was then agreed that Clark could reach Masferrer through Ross's office for about a week, and thereafter could pass a message to him through Ross.

8. Clark got in touch with me because I had known him during the war; I had known his family for many years, and one of his closest friends, James B. Watriss, is a cousin of mine and was, until about a year ago, associated with the Agency. Incidentally, I believe that Clark has had some discussions with SOD with the idea of possibly being used in connection with special operations.

SOURCE:

See below.

Source for paras. 1 to 3: Former Latin American diplomat
who maintains relationships with officials of Latin American
countries. Source is a trained reporter and his infor-
mation has been reliable in the past. He received the
information in this report from an associate of Rolando
Masferrer Rojas.

1. On 20 August 1965 an associate of Rolando Arendio Masferrer
   Rojas, former Cuban senator, said that Masferrer is in touch
   with General Leon Cantave regarding a plot to invade Haiti
   from the Dominican Republic. Masferrer is trying to recruit
   unmarried Cubans in New York who are willing to go to the
   Dominican Republic and eventually to live in Haiti. He does
   not want Cubans who would want to return to the United States
   because of family or for any other reason.

2. Masferrer asked Antonio Rojas Masferrer, his cousin, to manage
   a farm in the Dominican Republic which will be used as a
   training and staging area for about 100 men which Masferrer
   will recruit. This group will be enlarged by men which Cantave
   has in the Dominican Republic.

3. Cantave is negotiating with Dominicans to determine whether
   the recruits from New York will travel to the Dominican
   Republic with visas or whether they will enter the country
   illegally.

SOURCE: Former Latin American diplomat who maintains relationships with officials of Latin American countries. Source is a trained reporter and his information has been reliable in the past.

1.  As of about 16 April 1965, Rolando Masferrer Rojas, a Cuban exile leader, had been sending weapons to Miami, Florida, for use by Haitian exiles in an attempt to overthrow Haitian dictator Francois Duvalier. The arms were being stored in the home of Aurea Esther Poggio Aragon, La Cuban woman whose last known address was 1481 E. 8th Court, Hialeah, Florida. The weapons were to be transported to an undisclosed destination outside the United States.

2.  In early April 1965, Poggio went to the Dominican Republic on behalf of Masferrer regarding the Haitian exile scene. When Poggio was out of Miami, the keys to her residence were left with Antonio Rojas Masferrer.

3.  Field Comment: The same source reported in CSDB-3/661,878, dated 18 June 1964, that Masferrer had met with Poggio, among others, on 29 May 1964 regarding an expected revolt in Cuba.

THIS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE CRADING ARE DEFINITIVE APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE

1. On a week-end during the latter part of September 1964, a group of about 250 Cuban exiles were receiving military training at the "Jose Marti Encampment" which was on a farm owned by a New Jersey councilman or individual of similar political position. The farm is in a mountainous region just off Interstate Route 80 about one and a half hours by automobile out of Union City, New Jersey. The camp is directed by Martinez Morejon (fnu) and Bienvenido Queto; it is active only on week-ends, but there is a permanent armed guard at the camp.

2. Training consists of storming and capturing hilly redoubts, and training in the use of weapons which range from semi-automatic to fully automatic rifles, sub- machineguns, and .30- and .50-caliber machineguns.

3. Rolando Masferrer Rojas and about 50 of his followers were among those under- going training. Masferrer is purported to say that the camp was being operated without any financial assistance from the United States Government. Masferrer also said that rather severe measures would be affected against any United States government informer who might be discovered at the camp.

4. According to some of the individuals who were undertaking training, small groups of Masferrer's men were periodically being sent from the New Jersey area to Miami. Gent, and Alfaro (fnu) are administering the transfers. After arriving in Miami they were taken to Sheriff's Key, or some small key in the vicinity of Sheriff's Key, were they were being staged prior to invading Cuba, as to be the first step in the plan for an eventual landing in Cuba.

5. There was no apparent degree of ill-feeling between many former Castro adherents and the "Masferrer's Tigers" at the Camp. Boso Puerta Hiscano were also in training there.

SOURCE: Former high-level Latin American Government official (C) who has travelled frequently throughout the Caribbean and Central Azerica where he maintains close friendships with a wide range of military and political leaders. Source is a rightist, a trained reporter, and his information has been fairly reliable in the past. This information was ołtained from Rolando Arcadio Masferrer Rojas.

1. Bolando Arcadio Masferrer Rojae, prominent Cuban exile and financial backer of several Caribbean paramilitary operations directed against Fidel Castro Ruz, revealed on 11 July 1964 that he is maintaining close contact with Dominican Consul Carlos Peguero Guerrero, the brother of General Belisario Peguero Guerrero, Dominican Police Chief. Masferrer said that he is collaborating with Consul Peguero by giving his full support to the Partido Liberal Evolucionista (PLZ, Liberal Evolutionist Party) and that he is ready to go to the Dominican Republic should Luis Amiama Tio, a leader of the PIZ, call for him. When discussing the method by which Masferrer was participating with the PLE, Masferrer suggested that he vas prepared to offer his Cutan assets to the Dominican supporters of Aniana should the latter cocide to carry out action against the triumvirate government.

2. Concerning the future of Joaquin Balaguer as a Dominican presi- dential candidate, Hasferrer said that Balaguer was "nistaken" in his belief that he would soon be able to return to the Dominican Republic. The Dominican authorities will not perait the return of Balaguer because Diego Pordas Hernandez, former leader of the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD, Dominican Revolutionary Party), was successfully financing a "stop Balaguer" movement.

According to Kasferrer, Bordas recently paid Stanley Ross, editor of the Her fork publication "El Tiempo", $5,000 to assist Bordas in stopping Balaguer from obtaining favorable publicity in the Ross publications.

Concerning the next candidate supported by the PLE, Masferrer said that the PLE political machine had planned to promote General Antonio Imbert Barrera instead of Amiana although Amiama had previously been pushed for the presidential candidacy with the support of the PLE.

Concerning Cuba, Masferrer said that he has 250 highly trained men available for paramilitary action against the Castro regine. He is personally carrying out daily practice sessions in a light twin-engine aircraft in preparation for future flights to be made by Masferrer in distributing propaganda and attacking strategic points in Cuba. He has no immediate plans, however, for an invasion nor did he reveal the locations of arms and money which he clains to have at bis disposal. He said, however, that he has much faith in the United States Government and its appraisal of the Cuban probles and expected a "green light" to be forthcoming from the United States Government soon.

Masferrer said that unfortunately several prominent politicians and government officials have been recommending that he not be permitted to return to the State of Florida in spite of an earlier petition signed by many Cuban exiles requesting an amendment to an earlier court ruling prohibiting K sferrer from returning to Florida.[^1]

When asked about the participation of other Cuban exile leaders with Masferrer's group, Masferrer did not comment other than to say that Carlos Harquez Sterling was a "lyric post" but that his association with kasferrer had not been productive.

[^1]: Field Comment: Refer to CSDB-3/661,878, dated 19 June 1964, regarding the efforts of Masferrer's brother to obtain the signatures of Cuban exile leaders, which he intended to submit to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami with a request for Masferrer's legal return to Miani.

On 29 May 1934 Rolando Arcadio Masferrer Rojas, a Cuban exile leader, met with Miguel Taberno Blas, former member of the Cuban House of Representatives; Cecilio Ignacio Hapoles Hidalgo, former army major during the administration of Fulgencio Batista; Estaer Dorgio Aragon, a Cuban woman, Masferrer seid that within the next 60 days there would be a revolt within the ranks of Castro's forces and that anti-Castro groups would become active both in Cuba and outside.

*234298*

2. Masferrer said that Manuel Ray Rivero, leader of the Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (JURE, Cuban Revolutionary Junta), would play an important role in the events that wore to transpire in the next two months. Although he did not elaborate on just how the revolt would come about, Masferrer did say that the uprising vould be possible because those persons participating in the revolt would have access to weapons and ammunition already cached in Cuba.

3. On 4 June 1964 Enrique "Kiki" Masferrer Rojas, Rolando's brother, had obtained the signatures of several Cuban exile leaders, which be intended to submit to the Immigration and Naturalization Service at Niani requesting authorization for Masferrer to return to Miant. It was expected that the document would be submitted sometime in early June 1964.

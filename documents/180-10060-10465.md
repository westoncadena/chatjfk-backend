May 25, 1977

Honorable Louis Stokes
Chairman
House Selectcommittee
on Assinations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing in order to clarify the present situation regarding the receipt of back pay, which in my case had accrued from January 1, 1977 until April 11, 1977.

On that date in April, I visited your office to inform you that my husband had received the Republican Party endorsement in Philadelphia's race for District Attorney, and that I would be returning to Philadelphia to join him in his effort to win that election. However, during that same conversation, I expressed concerns of the timing of my depart- ure, for fear that if I left my position as Staff Counsel prior to the Committee receiving its funding, I might not receive my back pay.

In response to my concerns, you offered me your personal "moral commitment" that I could leave and your full assurance that the 35% which had been deducted from my salary for more than three months, would definitely be forward- ed to me upon the Committee receiving its funding from the house.

It has now come to my attention through Bob Lehner and Tom Howarth that I will not be receiving more than $800.00 of those monies owed me.

While I would never consider asking for any- thing to which I am not entitled, I respectfully submit that I do deserve to receive that for which I worked during that 3-1/2 month period.

I remain confident that this matter will be reconciled in accordance with our previous conversation. If there are any problems in this regard, please do not hesitate to notify me.

I extend my best wishes and hope that all is going well with the Committee.

Sincerely,
![signature]
Terry W. Lazin

Mrs. Terry W. Lazin
The Plaza Apartments
18th and Parkway
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103

Dear Mrs. Lazin:

I am sorry that there is a misunderstanding relative to my position on your back salary. I have consistently held that any employee would receive back salary if such could be worked out before the employee terminated services with the Committee.

You were paid the maximum salary possible for the eleven days you worked in April. Unfortunately, your termination date of April 11th precluded you from receiving the full amount you would have been entitled to if you had stayed with the Committee longer.

The Rules of the House prohibit paying salary to anyone not actually employed by the House. Furthermore, keeping you on the payroll after your termination while you were actively working in your husband's political campaign could prove very embarrassing to the Committee.

You did fine staff work with the Committee and if you decide to return at some future date we shall be happy to give you every consideration.

Sincerely,

LOUIS STOKES
Chairman

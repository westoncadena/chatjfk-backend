STARTING 3 JULY AND WITH AN ACTUAL RETIREMENT DATE SET FOR 30 SEP.
WINFIELD-WI-LL-BE-AC/EA/TIB UNTIL THE DIVISION PMAP SOON DECIDES ON
THE NEXT BRANCH CHIEF. HE IS A LEADING CANDIDATE FOR THE
POSITION. FINAL WORD SHOULD BE OUT TO YOU ALL BY EARLY JULY. IN
ANY EVENT, IT HAS BEEN VERY SATISFYING WORKING WITH YOU ALL OUT
THERE VICARIOUSLY (UNFORTUNATELY) FOR THE MOST PART THOUGH I DID
GET TO MEET AND RENEW ACQUAINTANCES WITH THE COS'S AND SOME OF THE
CAO'S DURING YOUR TRIPS BACK HERE. THE WORK YOU ALL ARE DOING IS
TERRIFIC AND BEING ACCOMPLISHED UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS.
IT WAS GREAT BEING INVOLVED WITH YOUR EFFORTS AND I HOPE OUR
SUPPORT HAS BEEN UP TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS. I AM SURE THAT THE VERY
SOLID OPERATIONS YOU ALREADY HAVE IN TRAIN WILL CONTINUE TO
SUCCEED; AND, BASED ON THE OBVIOUSLY HIGH MOTIVATION BY ALL OF YOU
OUT THERE, I AM SURE YOU WILL ALL BE ACCOMPLISHING MANY OTHER GOOD
THINGS FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND THE COUNTRY. I WISH YOU THE BEST
IN YOUR ENDEAVORS AND YOU CAN COUNT ON THE FACT THAT I WILL STILL
BE CHEERING FOR ALL OF YOU AND THE AGENCY FROM THE RETIREMENT SIDE
LINES. GOOD LUCK, EMERSON.

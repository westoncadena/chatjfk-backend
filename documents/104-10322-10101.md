MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : Donald F. Vogel

SUBJECT : Talking Paper for Briefing Chairman Stokes,
HSCA, on KITTY HAWK

1. The Chief Counsel of the House Select Committee on Assassination, Mr. G. Robert Blakey, has requested access to "all reports and documents referring to an operation code named KITTY HAWK," which Mr. Blakey describes as "a project concerning the debriefing of a Soviet defector and a KGB analysis of the Kennedy assassination." You propose to provide Chairman Stokes an oral response to this request.

2. Chairman Stokes may be informed that "KITTY HAWK" is not a defector but is a very sensitive in-place KGB source with whom we have not had recent contact but who is known to be alive and well. There has been some mention of KITTY HAWK in the press in connection with the current investigation of the fate of Nicholas SHADRIN, an FBI-CIA double agent who disappeared in 1975 while in Vienna for a meeting with the KGB. In spite of the unfortunate publicity, however, KITTY HAWK has apparently been able to survive KGB scrutiny thus far, and we continue to abide by the Director's statutory obligation to protect his identity.

3. We have reviewed our holdings on KITTY HAWK and have found no reference to any "KGB analysis of the Kennedy assassination" or any other information pertinent to the Committee's interest. Discussion of the assassination of

President Kennedy took up only a small portion of the time spent in debriefing KITTY HAWK. You may wish to inform Chairman Stokes that in 1966 KITTY HAWK volunteered his impression that Kennedy's assassination "was planned and carried out by VIP's, possibly due to Kennedy's opposition to Texas oil interests." He added that he believed that the KGB was embarking on a "disinformation" campaign to have the assassination blamed on President Johnson, but he had no specific details of this campaign. KITTY HAWK also said that he was "personally well acquainted" with Lee Harvey Oswald's background because he had helped prepare the file on Oswald which was turned over to the United States Government by the Soviet Government. KITTY HAWK was not questioned further on this point, and there is no further reference in the KITTY HAWK file to any KGB or Soviet Government activity with respect to the assassination.

4. Although strictly speaking it is not relevant to this inquiry, you should be aware of the fact that KITTY HAWK supported Nosenko's bona fides by reporting that Nosenko had done the KGB considerable damage (more than Golitsyn) and that the KGB was looking for Nosenko and intended to kill him if they found him. This is pertinent because those who hold to the theory that Nosenko was a plant tend also to subscribe to the belief that any KGB source or defector who supported Nosenko's bona fides was also KGB-controlled. Introduction of KITTY HAWK into the assassination controversy can only serve the purpose of obfuscation.

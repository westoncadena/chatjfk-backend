   MINISTER BUSTAMANTE 4 SEPTEMBER THAT GOVT WOULD NOT ALLOW JAMAICA BE
   USED FOR COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY PURPOSE AGAINST CUBA MUST BE TAKEN

   RESIDENT IN CUBA.

TYPE DELEGATION IN JAMAICA WOULD BE HARMFUL TO KUBARK AND ODYOKE
INTERESTS (SEE KNGS Ø123).

3. COS PREPARED CONSIDER ASSIGNMENT STAFF OR CONTRACT AGENT TO
   JAMAICA UNDER NON-OFFICIAL COVER TO HANDLE CUBAN AND RELATED

   HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE BE ON CUBAN COVERAGE. WOULD NEED
   ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TRAINED IN COMMO AND ADMIN.

4. IN VIEW PRODUCTIVE LIAISON AND DEVELOPING UNILATERAI. ACTIVITIES

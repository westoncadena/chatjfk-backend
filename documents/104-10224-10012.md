MEMORANDUM FOR: Lee H. Wigren

VIA : Head of Career Service

FROM : R. DeFelice
Acting Director of Personnel

SUBJECT : Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their eventual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to inform each employee, well in advance of retirement, of the services the Agency provides for retirement planning.

2. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To assist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You will, in the future, be invited by a Retirement Counselor to an individual pre-retirement counseling session, or more than one if you wish. This phase of retirement planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement system under which you will retire. The individual counseling sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits, life and health-insurance, Social_Security, taxes, and assistance in obtaining other employment. In addition, you will be invited to attend a Retirement Information Seminar that will be offered in the autumn of 1978.

3. Experience has amply demonstrated that advance preparation eases the transition to retirement. I recommend, strongly, that you avail yourself of the services the Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: John P. O'Reilly
Lee H. Wigren

SUBJECT : Letter of Commendation

We have just completed a high level, sensitive conference of considerable importance to both this Directorate and the Agency. You had the responsibility for virtually every aspect of its organization and administration. The planning and execution had to be done with comprehensive attention to detail without losing sight of our overall objectives. For weeks in advance and, particularly, during the conference itself you carried out your duties with energy, skill and competence which have reflected very creditably upon the Agency. You showed considerable tact and alertness in anticipating problems before they could arise. The close and cooperative relationship you established with the command and support personnel at the meeting site, and your obvious rapport with our various guests, also contributed to the efficient yet cordial environment in which the conference was conducted. You faced demanding and often complex responsibilities, and I commend you for your excellent performance in meeting them.

Deputy Director for Operations

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDO Evaluation Boards

FROM : Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

SUBJECT : Promotion Recommendation for Lee H. Wigren

1. I recommend that Lee H. Wigren be promoted from GS-13 to GS-14. Mr. Wigren has been in grade since May 1962 and is now a GS-13, Step 8. He currently occupies a GS-15, Operations Officer, Branch Chief position.

2. Mr. Wigren was born 1 December 1923. He received a BA degree in Russian Studies from Yale University in 1947 and an MA degree in History from Harvard University in 1950. He entered on duty with CIA as a GS-06 clerk in March 1951. He subsequently attained professional status as an Intelligence Officer in 1952 and since that time has served variously as Intelligence Officer, Area Operations Officer, Biographics Officer, Instructor, and Operations Officer in DIV/D, Europe Division, SE Division, OTR, and since 1968 the Counterintelligence Staff.

3. Most of Mr. Wigren's career has involved CE and CI matters. He has been primarily concerned with various aspects of the Counterintelligence research and analysis activity of SE Division and, since 1968, the Counterintelligence Staff. In the course of his various assignments, he has developed a broad and deep substantive knowledge of the Soviet intelligence and security organs and their activities which has made him one of our more knowledgeable and effective CI analysts. He is careful and thorough in his research, he writes well, and he has an established reputation within and without CIA as an interesting and effective lecturer concerning counterintelligence matters. His career record reflects a consistently professional performance of above-average quality in his various CIA assignments. Additionally, that record is documented by several letters of appreciation from other US Government agencies and foreign liaison services for the highly professional assistance provided them by Mr. Wigren in the counterintelligence field.

4. Mr. Wigren is currently Chief of the External Research Branch of the CI Research and Analysis Group. He is performing the duties and responsibilities of this GS-15 position in a satisfactory manner. He manages the complex activities of six staff officers and nine contract personnel associated with this Branch and is responsible for the several research programs in which they are involved. He strives to direct and combine the best talents of the personnel under his supervision toward the achievement of his Branch's objectives while remaining sensitive to the personal and career interests of his employees. He is especially effective in dealing with the several contract personnel (including former defectors) under his supervision who, because of their professional status and diverse ethnic backgrounds, sometimes require especially understanding treatment.

5. In summary, Mr. Wigren is effectively and satisfactorily performing the duties of a GS-15 Branch Chief in a position which requires specialized substantive knowledge and the ability to manage activities and supervise personnel. I believe that his demonstrated ability in this position and his sustained record of job performance at an above-average level since his last promotion clearly merit his promotion to GS-14 at this time.

Dear Mr. Nelson:

(C) It is a distinct pleasure for me to express my sincere appreciation to Messrs. Raymond Rocca, William Decker, William Donnelly, John Bogart, Joseph Flaherty, Lee Wigren, Robert Thomas and Paul Johnson, all members of your staff, for their outstanding participation and support of our new "Soviet Intelligence Elective Seminar." This seminar provided an in-depth examination of the Soviet Intelligence and Security Services for twelve graduate degree candidates enrolled in the School's new Master's Degree Program in Strategic Intelligence.

(U) Each Agency participant displayed a thorough knowledge of the subject interlaced with personal experiences and analyses which made each presentation unique and extremely valuable for the seminar members. In addition to the participants' formal presentations, they also spent valuable time informally talking with individual members of the seminar and faculty. Our students and faculty were enthusiastic in their praise of all aspects for the program; and they especially appreciated the candid discussions of the problems Soviet intelligence poses both for the Agency and the Intelligence Community. Please convey to each participant our sincere thanks for his outstanding presentation and his interest in the School's Graduate Program.

(U) Your continued cooperation in assisting this School to educate students whose intelligence capabilities will be an asset to the Services and Intelligence Community is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,

South African Police Headquarters,
Private Bag 94,
Pretoria.
17th March, 1967.

Mr. R. Helms,
Central Intelligence Agency,
WASHINGTON DC.

Dear Mr Helms,

During a recent conversation with one of my officers in connection with the visit of Mr. Henry Pisanke and Mr. Leo Wigren, it suddenly dawned on me that although I had, at the time, requested both Mr. John Mortz and Messrs. Pisanko and Wigren to convey my sincere thanks and good wishes to you - which I am sure they did - I had not yet written to you personally in connection with the matter.

Hank and Lee, as we affectionately remember them, proved themselves to be most worthy ambassadors of your country, as well as your service and I feel convinced that they left behind them a number of sincere new friends. They are both obviously experienced officers with a wide and thorough knowledge of their respective fields and we found their lectures highly instructive.

Fortunately, circumstances permitted the majority of my senior officers to attend the course in Pretoria and the lucid manner in which Hank and Lee delivered their lectures, brought us all under a new and deeper awareness of the vital role being played by the United States in the struggle against international communism, and for the very great need of unity and closer co-operation amongst the peoples of the free world if the communist onslaught is to be successfully withstood.

Please once again accept my sincere thanks for having made two such able and experienced officers as Hank and Leo available for the purpose of lecturing to us.

Kindest regards
Sincerely,

![Signature]

H.J. VAN DEN BERGH. Major-General.

Mr. John H. Richardson

Central Intelligence Agency
Langley, Virginia 20505

Dear Mr. Richardson:

It is a pleasure to express the appreciation of the
Staff and Faculty of the U. S. Army Intelligence School
for the presentation by Mr. Lee A. Wigren, at Fort Holabird,
on 8 March 1967, to personnel attending Class 67-SO-2 of the
Senior Foreign Officer Intelligence Course..

Mr. Wigren's discussion of current trends in Soviet
foreign policy was factual and timely. His examples of
Soviet activity in the foreign policy sphere in Vietnam,
the Middle East and Africa were of definite value to this
class. The talk was highly interesting and was enthusiastic-
ally received.

Thank you for your continued cooperation in our guest
speaker program. Would you please convey to Mr. Wigren
the appreciation of the Staff and Faculty.

Sincerely,

![signature of Richard S. Smith]

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Lee 11. Wigren

THROUGH : Head of Career Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina- tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action to me. However, If the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board. This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys- tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici- pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi- ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis- cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made with- In 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestino Servicos Career Sorvice Board,
Socrotary

SUBJECT: Promotion Recommendation for Mr. Lee H. Wigren

1. In recommending most strongly Mr. Wigren's promotion from GS-12 to GS-13, I feel it is only necessary to emphasizo Mr. Wigren's educational background at Yale and Harvard, whore he received a B.A. and M.A. in History and Russian; his ten years of work in the Agency on Soviet intelligence in the CI Staff, FI/D, and SR Division; his ability during the past three years in SR to superviso a group of over twelve people performing a varioty of rosearch functions, ranging from major studios to operational aids, on the RIS; his appreciation of the counter-intelligence role of the Agency and his furtherance of our mission. in that respect by the high standards of excellence of his production; and his vigor in assuming and carrying out the duties of a job formerly held by a G3-15.

2. Mr. Wigren has been in grade for almost four years. He has had responsibilities and performed duties far above his grade level for three of those years while dealing with practically all of the DD/P, other agencies of the government, and foreign intelligence and security sorvicos. He is an acknowledged oxpert in his field and equalled in it by no one else in the Agency, and possibly in the government as a whole. His fitnese reports have roflected superior performance in every important respect and outstanding performance in many ways, with the highest personal characteristics possible, doing a job on a uniquely difficult subject, while using and training personnel who all too otton have had little or no background for their positions.

3. In my opinion, Mr. Wigren is the most qualified GS-12 in the Division for promotion to G3-13, and I believe that the above comments and our four previous promotion recommendations amply support me.

2 September 1959

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SR/30

SUBJECT: Promotion Request,
Loo H. WIGREN

1. It is requested that Mr. Higren be promoted to GS-13.

2. Mr. Wigren received his BA from Yale in 1947, majoring in history and Russian language and area studies, and his MA from Harvard in 1948 in history. He came on duty with the Soviet Intelligence Branch of what was then Staff C in March 1951, and stayed with that branch as a research analyst on Soviet Intelligence until after its transfer to SR/CE in early 1955, when he transferred to WE Division in search of a field assignment. Such assignment having become increasingly doubtful by 1957, he transferred to FI/D where he remained until assignment to this Division in April 1959 as Chief of SR/CE/Research.

3. I might as well admit at the start that I have known Mr. Wigren since we were in high school together and I have always been impressed with his ability, particularly in the research field. Additionally, he has been in or close to research on Soviet Intelligence for the past 8 years. This, combined with his academic background in research methodology, history in general and Russian history in particular, made him my natural choice for his present job although I had never worked directly with him before. In the past five months, I have had reason to be happy about my choice. The main need in SR/CE/Research has been for an established program of studies which we might expect to be produced in regular order; this has been a need, to my personal knowledge, since 1955. Mr. Wigren has quietly set up such a schedule with realistic target dates, is in touch with each study at each point during its production, and shows every indication of meeting his deadlines. He has a long-range interest in counter-intelligence, knows what he is doing and is able to orient his subordinates properly and direct their efforts.

4. Although Mr. Wigren has been in grade only a relatively short time, since April 1958, I feel that he is doing a difficult job excellently and that his promotion is justified on the basis of academic background, Agency experience and current performance.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

VIA:
FI/Personnel

SUBJSCT:
Personnel Action (Promotion)

1.  It is recommended that Mr. Lee WIGREN be promoted from GS-11 to GS-12. Mr. Wigren has been in his present grade since 16 January 1955. Since he was assigned to Division D on 23 September 1957, he has been under my supervision. His performance during this time has been at least at a GS-12 level.

2.  Mr. Wigren's duties warrant a GS-12. He is primarily engaged in research of a complex and tedious nature which requires a high degree of professional competence.

3.  Mr. Wigren deserves a promotion on the basis of his job performance. Since coming under my supervision, he has consistently shown himself to be a conscientious, diligent and capable employee; and the high quality of his reports are indicative of his intelligence, flair for research, and ability to write effectively.

Dear Mr. Wigren:

In reference to your application for employment, this letter is to assure you that the processing of your papers as a GS-6, $***,000*** per annum is being continued by this agency. A definite offer of employment cannot be made, however, until such time as all processing has been completed.

This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 10 February 1951, in behalf of Mr. Lee Wigren, who has applied for a position with this Agency.

We are seriously considering Mr. Wigren for employment; however, security clearance necessary for this agency is of such a detailed nature that considerable time is necessary before the checks are completed. On the information available to me I would say that it will take approximately three more weeks before the necessary checks will have been completed in Mr. Wigren's case.

Dear Mr. Mulcahy:

It has been some time sirce I have had any word regarding my application for a position with the C.I.A. At the time of my interview last fall, I understood that I would probably hear about it by the first of the year.

I should greatly appreciate a word as to the progress in processing of my application, and, if possible, the probable date on which I shall have to report to Washington. Such information would help me greatly in planning my course of action in the coming weeks.

If you should desire any additional information for my application, please let me know.

Sincerely,
Lee H Wigren

TO: SED

FROM: Chief, Staff C

SUBJECT: Lee H. WIERING

1.  It is requested that the above-named applicant be processed with a view toward appointing him to the position of Intelligence Officer, GS-6, in Staff C/G2). Inasmuch as he is presently unemployed, it would be appreciated if this could be handled as soon as possible...

3.  In the event it is not contemplated that the applicant will be informed within the next week or ten days that his application is receiving favorable consideration, please let us know and we will write to him directly.

Central Intelligence Agency
National Security Council
2430 E Street NW
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

I wish to inquire about openings with the Central Intelligence
Agency for a man of my qualifications.

I am a graduate of Yale University (A.B., 1947), and have an
M.A. degree from Harvard University (1948). In addition, I have
completed two years of work toward a degree of Ph.D. at Harvard.

My major studies have been in history, government, and related
subjects, with concentration in United States history. Part of my
work at Yale was done under the wartime Army Specialized Training
Program in Russian area and language studies. The graduate work
which I have done has included research and writing in seminars
as well as class study.

During World War II, I had approximately two years of admin-
istrative and teaching experience with the Information and Education
Branch of the Army. After serving as a lecturer, I was sent to the
School for Personnel Services, Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, Virginia, and was promoted to Administrative Non-
Commissioned Officer in the Information and Education Office, Camp
Pickett, Virginia. For one and one-half years in that position, I
aided in the development of an education program for all permanent
personnel at that camp. I was in direct charge of the program of
weekly classes and discussion groups on history and current events.
These classes covered such topics as: the progress of the war,
the U.S. and its allies, and information about the enemy. My
duties included supervising and inspecting classes, training in-
structors, doing research and preparation of class material,
lecturing, planning displays, developing news dissemination media,
and doing educational counselling. This work necessitated close
cooperation with the Intelligence and Security officers of the camp.

I am twenty-six years of age and unmarried. I am a veteran
of World War II, but not a member of any reserve.

I should prefer a position involving historical research or
some related field, but would be interested in any opportunity
that might be available. If there should be an opening for which


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

Ly education and experience would qualify me, I should appreciate being com idered for it. My academic records, personal and academic recommendations, er further details concerning my military work will be supplied if desired.

In August 1976 Mr. Wigren agreed to be responsible for establishing and managing a counterintelligence prodaction element for the CI Staff. He has continued in that capacity up to the present time, in addition to serving as the nominal focal point for one of our more important Cl defectors. Although he took the publication assignment with some reservations, he has done an excellent job of sponsoring, processing and publishing a variety of important counterintelligence documents for use with foreign and domestic intelligence and security services. He is well aware of the widespread respect and admiration for his achievements in this position, both in the processing of written studies and presentations which he makes based on his extensive counterintelligence background and knowledge. While he might find better acceptance with some operational background, there are also special advantages and strengths which derive from the depth of headquarters staff experience which constitutes. his career. He is a very cooperative and responsive officer and is now felt to be the best candidate to take over counterintelligence training for the Agency, which hệ will phase in to in the near future.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I endorse the rating officer's comments on Mr. Wigren's performance. One of the things that has impressed me most during my nine months as Chief of the Counter- intelligence Staff has been the impact of the publications program on the intel- ligence community at large. In the CI field, there is nothing in the U.S. Government comparable to it. With the current intensification of interest in counterintelligence, it affords the Agency a means of speaking to a wide audience on issues and problems of abiding concern. Mr. Wigren has done excellent work in drawing upon the resources of the Staff_to-collect and then to present counterintel- ligence materials in a_way-calculated to serve their purpose admirably. I have also drawn-heavily on Mr. Wigren to prepare special briefing materials for my own continued

Mr. Wigren received a well-deserved promotion during this reporting period and moved in August to become the Staff Publications Officer. He made solid progress in the early part of the reporting period in making the transition from the narrow sphere he occupied in the previous Staff organization to the much more varied and challenging duties of the External Branch. By the time he left that position he had mastered its peculiar problems and proven his capability to manage its unusual personnel effectively and productively. He has retained responsibility for exploita- tion of the most useful asset in that branch and recently conducted the asset on a series of liaison visits which has resulted in a significant advance of our CI rela- tions with the services concerned.

He has moved vigorously into the function of Publications Officer, which is one of the most important activities in the Staff. He was selected for this assignment because of his deep CI experience, writing ability, and his mature judgment in selecting and preparing CI information appropriate to various audiences. Cost- effective influences which he faces by participation in local government are also applied in his Agency work. He deals confidently with senior officers of the Staff and other components and gets the best effort out of his subordinates. His present assignment is tailor-made for him, and he exhibits no significant weakness in per- forming it.

I concur with the present assessment of Mr. Wigren's performance by the rating officer. As chief of the External Branch he turned in a highly satisfactory performance. In his present capacity, Staff Publications Officer, he is off to an excellent start. I believe the passage of time will demonstrate that Mr. Wigren's strongest points, never heretofore fully exploited, are in writing and supervising publi- cations of counterintelligence materials. Already one of the new CI Staff monthly publications which he initiated some time ago is earning us plaudits from both domestic and foreign counterintelligence services. Mr. Wigren's work comes to my attention several times a week. I am most pleased that he is a member of the staff at this time.

Mr. Wigren. is doing a quite satisfactory job of running the R&A External Research Branch. When the Group was reorganized he was almost fully committed to Duty No. 3 above. While maintaining that function at a commendable level of performance, he has accepted the assignment of running a new branch which is an amalgamation of components of several previous R&A branches. Comprising, as it does, the disparate clements of defector, contract, and staff officers, Mr. Wigren has done a very good job of assigning work and getting it done by this branch. He gets along well with the personnel and seems well-suited to the kind of bread-and-butter research and analysis which the branch carries out. He is very serious and purposeful in his approach and can be relied on to carry out assignments effectively and on time. His long experience in CI matters and his knowledge of past activities and events in the Staff are a valuable adjunct to the branch chief function which he now fulfills: He is one of very few officers of the former Staff who have been selected to participate in the reorganization and reorientation of the CI effort. He has shown by his performance and attitude a quite acceptable capability to adjust to the present Staff requirements in terms of methodology and intellectual approach. He is conscientious and enthusiastic, and is still feeling his way to some extent organizationally and functionally in his new position. He reflects genuine consideration for the costs of performing his functions.

Success in that respect is important to the Agency for reasons not necessarily associated with the value of the product which emerges from these projects.

Although Subject has only been under my supervision for some four months, I can but agree with earlier comments on his performance. Subject has an encyclopedic knowledge of the organization, function and history of the various Soviet intelligence and security organs. He is a highly skilled researcher and a gifted writer. His work in preparing classified studies on the various aspects of the Soviet intelligence services and operations has been consistently impressive.

Subject has not had the field experience usually associated with his age and grade, but the lack of this has not been a drawback in his chosen research duties. In the future Subject will profit from seeking out opportunities for further activity rather than, as at present, waiting until assignments are given to him.

In addition to his research abilities, Subject is a highly effective lecturer, much sought after by other agencies who are conducting training in the CI field.

Subject has encountered some slight problems with his staff during the reporting period, but these are essentially minor. In my opinion Subject is in the forefront of research personnel at his grade level.

SIGNATURE OF EMPLOYEE

I endorse Mr. Hood's Section D evaluation. I have found Mr. Wigren to be a very dependable and resourceful individual in undertaking the extensive research commitments that the staff has undertaken in meeting very heavy obligations of sensitive liaison exchanges over the past year. Mr. Wigren is above all a gentleman in his attitude toward and treatment of others. I would say in the long run his works to his disadvantage because his contribution and his modesty tend to be overridden by the pretentions and bluster of others. Mr. Wigren has what has now become a most precious commodity to the DDO in counterintelligence and that is a grasp on many of the aspects of the collegial memory. He is therefore in a position not only to contribute useful ideas for new projects, but to correct, amend, and modify suggestions and courses of action put up by others who do not have the facts. In other words, this is a man whose continued utility and potential are considerable in my judgment.

If extra space is needed to complete Section D, attach a separate sheet of paper.

In the past six months the compartmented nature of Mr. Wigren's work has brought him more directly into the DC/CIOPS cognizance rather than the Chief of the R&A component as has previously been the case.

I think Mr. Wigren's strengths and weaknesses have been winnowed thoroughly in previous reporting. He is a recognized expert in his topic and as such he represents a considerable capital investment by the Agency in that kind of expertise. He can write and he can speak with unusual fluency on his specialty and in consequence is a key man in the ongoing research and study of sensitive Soviet intelligence and security organization and operations, particularly penetrations and disinformation. This statement is backed up by production, in the form of briefing papers, memoranda, and other production, which goes outside the Agency. I have found his work to be extremely satisfactory and more particularly, it is if he is given the time and specifications which are ingredients of his meticulous and thoroughgoing approach to his work. Mr. Wigren could carry on in his specialty at a very high level of competence in any other part of the Agency, or for that matter anywhere in Government where there is any interest in Soviet intelligence and security. I am firm in the view that he merits the overall grading of "Strong."

As was noted in the preceding fitness report, Mr. Wigren has a solid and broad knowledge of the USSR: its history, government, and intelligence services. He also has a useful working knowledge of Russian, Consequently he serves in CI/R&A as senior referent on the RIS, against which target most of the group's work is directed.

as

A key responsibility in R&A is to serve/the Staff's repository and memory for essential elements of information about the RIS. Mr. Wigren has organized this abundance of material effectively, has ensured its retrievability, and continues to update it.

Mr. Wigren consistently shows sound and dispassionate judgment. He does not jump to conclusions but digs out the pertinent facts and brings them into proper focus. He is skeptical without being negative. He accepts tasks and responsibilities without quibbling, and he carries out these assignments successfully without needing further consultation or guidance.

He is a quiet person who keeps a low profile; but when a significant issue is at stake, he is firm, even tenacious, when persuaded that the facts are on his side.

His supervisory responsibility is limited to providing guidance to one secretary whom he shares with others. I should not hesitate, however, to assign other employees to his supervision if our T/O permitted. His past record and his current performance (which demonstrates an ability to look ahead, to grasp essentials, to get along with others, and to be both fair and firm) show that he can handle a manager's role very well.

Mr. Wigren's responsibilities have broadened during the reporting period and will continue to grow. In part this change has resuited from the assignment of Mr. Edward Knowles to CI/OPS, but in equal or greater measure it is the product of Mr. Wigren's demonstrated ability to carry added responsibility with equanimity and resourcefulness.

Mr. Wigren has a very sound knowledge of the Soviet Union: its history, government, intelligence services, etc. He reads widely to keep his knowledge current. He maintains an excellent balance between a respect for the importance of facts and a creative faculty. Recently he has been increasingly concerned with ways to ensure a more regular, orderly flow of essential counterintelligence into this office and with restructuring the organization of this information to make it more readily responsive to our needs. His approach has been both imaginative and sound.

His work shows a very high level of organizational ability. This is reflected in his structuring of a report or speech, in the lucidity of his expression, and in his grasp of the inter-relatedness of the functions of this group. He is thoughtful and temperate; he does not jump to conclusions, show

Mr. Wigren joined CI/R&A on 14 July 1968, so that this fitness report is his first in his present assignment. Consequently a significant part of his time has been used, during the period of this report, in familiarizing himself with his job and its potential. His performance, nonetheless, has been consistently strong.

He brings to his assignment an excellent background, both academically and in terms of Agency experience. He shows consistently sound judgement and equanimity, an ability to sort out facts and to reach decisions on a factual basis. He seeks and welcomes guidance but is also fully capable of acting independently within his limits of responsibility.

Mr. Wigren has an excellent potential in the area of research and analysis. He has no present supervisory responsibilities. He is consistently aware of the significance of the cost factor.

Amplily or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for datermining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Wigren is a conscientious and capable research officer with a good grasp of his material and is able to implement it effectively to audiences of widely varied sophistication. Since his last report, the basic orientation of SR/CI has changed, and is now directed almost wholly to the creation and exploitation of operations. The organization thus needs more urgently than ever the digested operational experience which it is Mr. Wigren's job to produce. This has made it necessary to apply strict priorities based on operational need and relevancy, which has been difficult for Mr. Wigren, who has no direct operational experience. He has not been able to get the most out of his people, nor give them the sort of close and consistent guidance which some of them require in the face of changing or sudden requirements. He has a tendency το be over-concerned with organizational and bureaucratic exercise to the expense of substantive production. Nonetheless, his real qualities came to the fore recently when he produced well and used his staff effectively on an important and complicated project. He is a distinct asset in his responsible and demanding job.

Mr. Wigren performs his duties with maximum economy.

NARRATIVE COMMEIFTS

Mr. Wigren is extremely proficient in handling his section from both the personnel and managerial standpoints. In addition, he is an expert on Soviet Intelligence in his own right and lectures on the topic to officials of this and other governments. He is particularly capable at training new researchers.

In reviewing his file today, I note that the Revieving Official for his fitness report of a year ago noted his opinion that my ratings of Mr. Wigren at that time were too high. That opinion was not discussed with me or with Mr. Wigren. Perhaps the ratings were indeed too high, but I must say that considering the Fitness Report form and criteria in use at that time and his performance in relation to that of other officers in this branch and outside it, I would give him the same ratings today for that period.

The ratings in this current report will appear slightly lower than those of the last report. This is not entirely due to the different report form. Mr. Wigren's problems increased in both intensity and complexity during this period, and I do not feel that he met the increased burden with as much of ar increase in performance as was necessary. This should not at all detract from my rating of his overall performance, which is still exceptional and only slightly less than outstanding.

Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Mr. Wigren's performance during the past year has been outstanding in every important respect. Despite great pressure and frequently difficult assignments he has directed his section in a calm and mature manner which has enabled it to meet deadlines on R&D research despite the relative inexperience of its personnel. His potential for development is excellent and the responsibilities of his section are being expanded to enable it to produce even more of its high-quality product.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

While I quite agree that Mr. Wigren has done a very fine job, I consider that the ratings in Section E are overly generous. I base this on the fact that I know of no other highly-competent officer who has received 7 ratings on two-thirds of his specific duties; and I do not believe that Wigren's performance is better than any other officer's I know. There is no question in my mind that Wigren's performance in this job has been superior to any previous incumbents.

Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

As Chief of SR's Research Section on Soviet Intelligence, Mr. Wigren's performance has continued to be superior in the same manner as described in Section E of last year's report. In addition to this he has worked closely with OIR on the revamping of the CI Operations Course. He has been particularly effective in organizing and leading briefings on the RIB given to chiefs and operations officers of foreign intelligence services during their visits to Washington, and in leading a seminar designed to assist SR personnel in handling liaison briefings. His success is carrying out a planned approach to SR's CI research problems, using personnel who have relatively little substantive experience, has been especially gratifying.

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training: Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Mr. Wigren has excellent substantive background on the Soviet Union and, except for a two year period on a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire 9 years in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another. His performance for the past year in a job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's can only be described as superior. He has not only assumed responsibilities greater than those of the previous incumbents; he has carried these out with a minimum of support and in a calm, mature manner which has earned respect on all sides. Although his analysts have often been relatively inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contribution during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of research in response to Agency and external requirements, and the establishment of improved records and procedures to carry out this program.

Although Mr. Wigren would prefer eventual assignment to the field as an operational officer, it seems to me his greatest potential lies in the kind of research and support of operations he is presently performing. I would therefore recommend that future training be oriented along these lines rather than strictly operational lines, and that planning for his eventual field assignment should emphasize his knowledge of Soviet Intelligence and his ability to deal with other specialists in a "liaison" relation.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

This officer is Intelligent and possesses good judgement. He is neat and methodical in his work. Within the area of his explicit duties he is a willing worker-who takes and executes orders faithfully. At this desk, the weaker aspect of his performance was in matters of initiative, drive and imagination.--Though this impression may be heightened by Mr. Wigren's naturally-quiet, unobtrusive manner, the final assessment must be that he is not inclined to go beyond carrying out assignments given to him.

SECTION D.

SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

DIRECTIONS: Take into account here everything you know about the individual....productivity, conduct in the job, pertinent personal characteristics or habits, special defects or talents....and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

1. DEFINITELY UNSUITABLE... HE SHOULD BE SEPARATED
2. OF DOUBTFUL SUITABILITY... WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED HIM IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW
3. A BARELY ACCEPTABLE EMPLOYEE... BELOW AVERAGE BUT WITH NO WEAKNESSES SUFFICIENTLY OUTSTANDING TO WARRANT HIS SEPARATION
4. OF THE SAME SUITABILITY AS MOST PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE ORGANIZATION
5. A FINE EMPLOYEE... HAS SOME OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS
6. AN UNUSUALLY STRONG PERSON IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION
7. EXCELLED BY ONLY A FEW IN SUITABILITY FOR WORK IN THE ORGANIZATION

| RATING NUMBER | 3-4 |
| ------------- | --- |

IS THIS INDIVIDUAL BETTER SUITED FOR WORK IN SOME OTHER POSITION IN THE ORGANIZATION? [X] YES [] NO

EXPLAIN FULLY: In view of his relative strengths and weaknesses, Mr. Wigren would seem better fitted for work requiring studious and methodical application to one or a few activities or projects, rather than as an across-the-board operations case officer, either at Headquarters or in the field.

FOR THE REVIENING OFFICIAL: RECORD ANY SUBSTANTIAL DIFORINOL OF OPINION SITH THE SUPERVISOR, OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION. WHICH BILL LEAD TO A BETTER LINDERSTANDING OF HIS REPORT.

I have discussed this report, and his general situation, in considerable detail with Mr. Wigren. He felt he did not wish to challenge the critical comments of the rating officers (I had two officers work together la that capacity), but felt that a rating of 3 under specific duty No.2 did not do him.justice. I think he right on this score and would raise that rating to a 4. I would say there has been an improvement in Mr. Migren's performance within the last year, and I have raised with the Division Porsonnel Board the subject of a promotion for him to GS-12. The Board recommended deferment of his case for a fewmonths.

[X] CONTINUED UN ATTACHED SHEET

I cretify that any substantial difference of opinion with the supervisor is reflected in the above section.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Most notable among this officer's strong qualities are his intelligence, inquisitiveness, emotional stability and good judgement. Ho comprehends and analyzes situations and problems readily and in the latter seems very able at finding logical solutions. Ho expresses himself woll orally and in writing. He is neat in both personal and work habits. Such weaknesses as Mr. Migren seems to have lie in the areas of social relationship and motivation. He is calm and introspective, not gregarious nor easy to know. Though he is always polite and even tempored he seems at the roots, perhaps, unduly consitive to criticism. In his attitude, towards and the performance of his job he seems to do what he likes woll, but to let the lessagreeable things slide.

SECTION D. SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

DIRECTIONS: Take into account here everything you know shout the individunt....productivity, conduct in the job, pertinent personal characteristics or hahita, special defects or talents....and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

1. DEFINITELY UNSUITABLE HE SHOULD AL SEPARATED

2. For the Reviewing Official (continued).

Mr. Wigren has also asked that it be made a matter of record that, for a period of three months in. 1956, he was acting chief of the Swedish Dosk and handled these responsibilities effectively. I have agreed to cite the extent of his responsibilitios. Certainly the routine business of the desk was kept moving during this period. I have pointed out with respect to the manner of his performance of his duties that his fitness report is *not* an unfavorable one. The factors which have turned this annual fitness roport into a personal crisis for him are the simultaneous deferment of his hoped-for promotion, and the deferment of an overseas assignment for him -- both of which actions naturally reflect on his past performance. I have pointed out that we have to requiro appreciably better than average performances from officers we send overseas, that I believe we have in the Branch at least one bettor qualified candidate for the overseas assignment in question, and that I am obliged to give the assignment to the person I feel is best qualified.

Perhaps understandably, Mr. Wigren continues to believe that this report is not a fair reflection of his performance. I have told him that I can go no further in attempting to explain my judgement and have asked that he discuss his situation with the Deputy Division Chief and/or the Division Chief. He agreed to do so.

4. COMMENTS CONCERNING POTENTIAL

He is, I believe, at a crucial stage in his career. Depending upon his exhibition during the next 3 to 5 years he will have become either a mediocre senior case officer or an officer ready and able to assume executive responsibilities. He already has the inherent judgement and intelligence for more responsible jobs, but has not yet demonstrated a sufficient industry and resolve to make him as a promising professional.

SECTION H. FUTURE PLANS

Mr. Wigron has been undergoing a variety of specialized training, including Swedish language, preparatory to an assignment in Stockholm. Such an assignment has been deferred and future training plans must therefore be held in abeyance.

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job. A large portion of Mr. Wigren's time is taken up with the processing of field information reports and the handling of administrative aspects of various FI projects, both of which he performs efficiently, although he requires supervision to ensure the prompt completion of project details. In the area of operational support for the field, which includes providing the station with requirements, with name traces, operational appraisal and operational guidance, Mr. Wigren performs acceptably but occasionally shows a lack of initiative and originality of ideas such as would be required to raise the rating in this category. As regards preparation of correspondence for the field, Mr. Wigren here again performs acceptably, but occasionally shows a lack of observance and attention to detail.

SECTION D. SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

3. INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF MONTHS THE RATED EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN UNDER YOUR SUPERVISION:

4. COMMENTS CONCERNING POTENTIAL

In the opinion of the rater, Mr. Wigren does not display quite the degree of initiative, originality of ideas, and attention to details required for assuming greater responsibility, although he is believed to be of better than average intelligence.

SECTION H. FUTURE PLANS

1. TRAINING OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL EXPERIENCE PLANNED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

Six Within the next twelve months Subject may be considered for an overseas assignment. It is believed that such an assignment may be beneficial in giving Mr. Wigren broader experience which may serve to increase his potential to the Agency.

2. NOTE OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN INDIVIDUAL'S FUTURE ASSIGNMENTS

Subject is desirous of having overseas duty. Should he be assigned to an overseas post, it is believed that this duty may provide him with the necessary stimulus to bring out latent potential in addition to broadening his experience. Should an overseas tour not result in an increase in potential, particularly as regards initiative and ability to think originally, it is recommended consideration be given to employing Subject in a research-type job.

TRAINING REPORT

MANAGEMENT FOR EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY (EEO)

Student: Lee H. Wigren Dates: 12-14 Sept 1977

Employee No.: 006198 Office: DDO/CI

Service Designation: D

COURSE DESCRIPTION

The course is designed especially for people in managerial and supervisory positions. It is based upon the assumption that the Agency's ability to promote full utilization of all employees regardless of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or age, depends upon the awareness and behavior of managerial/supervisory personnel. They have a critical role in making the decisions necessary to eliminate real or apparent discrimination and to promote productive work relations among employees who differ in race, sex, or culture. In fact managerial awareness and decisions have a great impact on the recommendations and efforts of EEO, FEP, Upward Mobility and other employees concerned with compliance and affirmative action.

OBJECTIVES

Through lectures, readings, films, group discussion, workshop exercises, and case studies, each supervisor, at the conclusion of the course, should be able to:

1) Identify some of the more prominent patterns of discrimination and describe their impact upon supervisory processes;
2) Have had the opportunity or been able to critically evaluate his or her own attitudes towards equality of opportunity:
3) Better contribute to the effective utilization of all employees by being aware of and sensitive to several creditable approaches to management behavior and actions;
4) Explain the historical background which gave rise to today's Equal Employment Opportunity Programs;
5) Articulate the Agency's progress in Equal Employment Opportunity Programs:
6) Describe what efforts the Agency is making to be fair to all employees, including describing such programs as the Upward Mobility Program, Federal Women's Program and the Hispanic Program:
7) Be responsive to the complaint process and know what he or she, as a supervisor, should do when faced with a complaint from an employer; and
8) Articulate the significance and importance of major legislation, executive orders and internal CIA policies which affect the management of Equality Opportunity Programs.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Lee H. Wigren

SUBJECT : Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category

REFERENCE : Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade

1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties, and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed (subject to your signature below) in the functional category DAA for Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are contained in the Evaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place- ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and career planning, may be judged against officers similarly placed pro- fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STUDY THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN CASE CAREFULLY.

2. In general, you should consider the following:

a. Categories are sharply defined. Competition is within categories, not between them. Thus, a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened by reclassifying it as B/OS.

b. A change in category after sustained performance in a different category may cause a temporary loss of momentum in your career advancement until you have demonstrated proficiency in your new assignment.

c. A category change should not be initiated for the period of a temporary, training or rotational assignment unless a permanent change of career track will follow.

3. If you believe that this is not the correct category for you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi- mates another category or because you have made a permanent change of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of vour home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category. Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the Career Management Staff.

4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to your Personnel Officer.

1. (S) During the period 20 October through 28 October 1975, twenty-seven Special Agents of this Service attended an intensive, comprehensive course of instruction regarding counterintelligence techniques as applied overseas, the instructors and facilities for which were graciously provided by your Agency. As in past matters of this nature, Mr. William M. Decker, Mr. Nazeeb Trabulsi, and the other dedicated members of your staff provided support and coordination truly unsurpassed in excellence. Both Mr. Decker and Mr. Trabulsi consistently devoted time and effort far beyond that which could normally be expected in order to ensure the highest quality of instruction and assistance.

2. (S) In addition to excellent administrative support, the caliber of instructors and content of the material discussed combined to make every presentation a significant and meaningful experience for the students concerned. Although it was evident that all instructors were highly motivated and fully conversant regarding their respective subjects, I wish to particularly cite those individuals who contributed generous amounts of their valuable time and extensive knowledge toward the improvement of the Naval Investigative Service counterintelligence posture overseas. Those gentlemen are:

1.  The Swiss Branch of the Eastern European Division wishes to express its appreciation to SR Division for its cooperation and support, in particular for the personal contribution of four of ite officers, Mr. Lee Wigren, Mr. Joseph Evans, Mrs. Kay Grady, and Mr. Edward Knowles, during the recent training program for three Swiss Federal Police officers.

2.  Mr. Wigren's, Mr. Evan's, Mrs. Grady's, and Mr. Knowles's uniformly excellent briefings on the Soviet Intelligence Services, their legal and illegal support structures, and their modus operandi contributed significantly to what we have reason to believe was a successful training venture. To this must be added the comments of the Swiss officers who pointed out that they were most impressed by the comprehensive and systematic development of the various themes which Mr. Wigren, Mr. Evans, Mrs. Grady, and Mr. Knowles presented and admitted that the briefings added a good deal to their knowledge of the subject.

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in conformance with the Civil Service Act, applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations and acts of Congress pertaining to appointment.

This form should be checked for taking of office, pension, suitability in connection with any record of recent discharge or arrest, and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of appointee. The appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application and/or other pertinent papers. The physical appearance may be checked against the medical certificate. The appointee may also be questioned on his personal history for agreement with his previous statements.

(2) Age - If definite age limits have been established for the position, it should be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for appointment. Until such determination is made, the appointment may not be consummated.

(3) Citizenship - The appointing officer is responsible for observing the citizenship provisions of (1) the Civil Service Rules and (4) appropriation acts. Form 1 constitutes an affidavit for both purposes and is acceptable proof of citizenship status in the absence of conflicting evidence. In doubtful cases the appointment should not be consummated until clearance has been secured from the certifying office of the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family - Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that whenever there are already two or more members of a family serving under probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service, no other member of such family is eligible for probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service. The appointments of persons entitled to veterans' preference are not subject to this requirement. The members-of-family provision does not apply to temporary appointments. Doubtful cases may be referred to the appropriate office of the Civil Service Commission for decision.

Projected Assignment or Present Position

1.  The Advanced Counterespionage Course is a specialized course of two weeks' duration designed for CE specialists and their supervisors. The Basic CE Course or equivalent experience is a normal prerequisite for entry into the Advanced CE Course. The course is conducted on a seminar, round-table basis. Emphasis is placed on student participation during staff and guest lectures. Time is allotted for reading the extensive material provided.

2.  Specialized techniques of CE operations are emphasized. Counter-espionage aspects of double agent operations, liaison situations, and defection are examined in detail. Special attention is given to the structure and modus operandi of Soviet and Satellite internal and external clandestine services. Similar studies are made of the Western Services, as they currently exist and as they may affect Agency operations.

3.  Each student is required to give a presentation before the class. This hour-long presentation is based on a problem assignment given the student by the staff. Exception is made where students have the field or headquarters experience in CE or a related field; such a student is permitted to give a one-hour lecture based on specific experience. The "canned" problems are selected to test students' ability to do CE research, collate, make logical analyses, and present ideas effectively to a seminar group.

4.  This evaluation is based primarily on the student presentation, and to a lesser degree on participation in seminar discussions when conducted by the staff.

SECRET

1.  Mr. Wigron ranked in the top bracket of a strong class. Ho contributed effectively in seminar discussions. Ho appeared to be alert, and to have a good grasp of CE fundamentals.

2.  Mr. Wigron's presentation dealt with his basic assignment in Staff C. The presentation was well organized and was a major contribution to the class's CE background.

3.  In my opinion, Mr. Wigron has the background and grasp of CE principles adequate for a CE case officer and analyst.

MEMORILLA FOR THE #10 Clock 3:
(Information & Education Enlisted Specialist, Aug, 1944 - Feb, 1946)

A. After completing the Army Specialized Training Program course in Russian area and language studies, I was assigned to the 16th Infantry, 78th Winter Division, then at Camp Pickett, Va. While with that unit, I conducted "Orientation" lectures covering world news and background material on the war (April-May 1944).

B. Because of my limited-service status, I was transferred to the Supply Section, Headquarters Detachment, 1518 Sou, at Camp Pickett, While a clerk in that unit, I performed the duties of unit Info & Education lecturer -- lecturing on history and current events, Mair-training rape and bulleting on the battle areas, and enrolling soldiers in correspondence courses. As a result of this work (May-July 1944), I was promoted to be Info & Education Non-Commissioned Officer in the Post Info & Education/Office.

C. The Post Information & Education Office was charged with the duty of planning, producing, and disseminating war information and non-literacy education for all troops permanently stationed at Camp Pickett and for a large hospital on the grounds. The purpose of this program was to help the troops to understand why and what we were fighting, and to understand their role in that fight. It was morale building through information.

As Non-Commissioned Officer for the Info & Education Office, I performed both administrative and functional duties. I aided in the development and execution of the policies and content of the education program, and was in immediate charge of the weekly instructional program. The following are the duties which I performed:

1. Prepared material for use in weekly lectures or discussions which all troops were required to attend.

- Info & Education Branch in Washington supplied topical information for use in these classes. I expanded, revised, or supplemented it to suit it to the needs of our camp.

2. Trained zen to conduct lectures in each of 12 to 10 units; briefed them on prepared material each week; and inspected their classes.

- Each company or unit as required to have one or more men with suitable education or experience to conduct weekly classes on history and current events under the direction of the Info & Education Office. At briefing conferences, I discussed with them the topic for the following week, suggested means of presentation, and described general policies to be followed. I made periodic inspection visits to classes conducted by these zen.

3. Lectured or conducted several discussions each week.

- The topics of these classes were the same as those conducted by other men: basic U.S. and world history, current events, background material on the war, the relation of the U.S. to its allies, the enemy, and the role of the individual soldier. These classes contained from 75 to 100 men each, with all educational levels represented.

    *   At Ly surrection, the nove disseminating medis at Camp Pickett, were expanded by establichacht of the newe sheet and h broadcasts. The news sheet contained late news bulletine, factual background material, and some editorials. The news sheet and broadcasts were necessitated by the remoteness of the camp.

3.  Did educational counselling and encouraged enrollments in cor- respondence courses offered by United States Armed Forces Institute.

4.  Maintained close cooperation with camp nerepoper starr, Public Relations Orice, the Special Services Office, and the Intelligenc Officer.

I believe that my work as Non-Commissioned Officer in the rest Information & Education Office at Cann Pickett, Virginia, from Ausgust 1944 to February 1946 would be valuable to the Central Intelligence Arency.

The job was given to me as a promotion. I received special training for it at the School for Personnel Services, Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. While perforsing the duties of this job, I received promotions in rank from Private First Class to Staff Sergeant. During the closing months of my service, I was in com lete charge of the office in the absence of any full-time Info Education Cfficer.

As the result of my work, I was invited to attend a conference of the Info & Education officers and non-comissioned officers of the Third Service Command at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and to address that conference on educational and counselling problers. Since my discharge was in process at that time, I was unable to attend. Upon discharge, I received a special commendation for my work from Colonel H.G.Paullin, Corsamling Officer of Camp Pickett, and a letter of reconcemiation from my superior.

(Copies of these letters, orders, and commendations will be, submitted if necessary.)

ADDITIONAL DATA, FOR ITEM #17:

1. Army Specialized Training Program, Russian area & language course
   (Yale University, July 1943 - April 1944)

After completing basic training in June 1943, I was sent to the examination center at Georgetown University to be tested for entrance into the Army Specialized Training Program.

On the basis of a language aptitude test, I was sent to Yale to take the A.S.T.P. course in Russian area and language studies. This was a nine-month course running from July 1943 through March 1944. I completed the course with grades of "Dean's list" rating, and received a certificate of completion of the course.

The program of study included courses in Russian history, geography, literature, and culture; modern European history; and Far Eastern history. Special lecturers from the Commerce Department, Lend Lease, and other agencies spoke to our classes occasionally.

Much attention was devoted to study of the Russian language. Classroom work, consisting of grammar, practice reading, and conversation occupied seventeen hours of our schedule each week. This was equivalent to about three years of normal language work.

2. School for Personnel Services, Course for Information & Education Enlisted Assistants (Washington & Lee U., Lexington, Va. Oct-Nov 1944)

In order to be better prepared for work as Post Information and Education Non-Commissioned Officer at Camp Pickett, Virginia, I was sent to take the one-month course for Info & Education Enlisted Specialists, October and November 1944.

This course was prepared by the War Department, and conducted by military personnel. It presented material to be used in the preparation of Info & Education programs in camps, it suggested methods of presentation, and it provided practical experience in assessing and dealing with "orientation program" problems.

Some of the topics covered in lectures and discussions were:

Ideas as Weapons
Know the Enemy
Group Leadership Principles
Know our Allies
Morale Factors
Know the U.S.A.
Global Warfare
Teaching Methods

In addition, movies and visual aides were demonstrated.

Upon completion of this course (with a grade of Excellent), I received a certificate, and a Military Occupational Specialty Classification of: MOS 2274 (Information and Education Enlisted Specialist).

SEC. 14-3-(continued from p.7)

## WORK & INFORMATION-EDUCATION SPECIALIST (MILITARY), (1944-46)

(1) After completing the ASTP course at Yale, I was assigned to the Country Section, Camp Pickett, Va. While there, I conducted "Orientation"-type lectures covering world news and background material on the war (May-July 1944).

(2) Because of my limited-service status, I was transferred to the Supply Section, 1312 SCU, at Camp Pickett. I performed the duties of a unit Info & Education lecturer -- lecturing on history and current events, maintaining maps and bulletins on battle areas, and enrolling soldiers in USAFI correspondence courses (May-July 1944). As a result of this work, I was promoted to the Post Info & Education Office.

(3) The Post Information & Education Office had to plan, produce, and disseminate war information and non-military education for all troops permanently stationed at Camp Pickett, and for a hospital on the grounds. The purpose of that program was to help troops to understand why and what we were fighting, and to understand their role in that fight. It was morale building through information.

As Non-Commissioned Officer for the Info & Education Office, I performed both administrative and functional duties. I aided in the development and execution of the policies and content of the education program, and was in immediate charge of the weekly instructional program.

The following are the duties I performed:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 304

a) Prepared talks to use in these classes. I prepared, or revised, or supplied talks to suit them to the needs of our men.

b) Trained men to conduct lectures in and of 14 to 16 units; inspected their classes.

- Each company unit was required to have one or more men with suitable education or experience to conduct weekly classes on History and current ever to mider direction of the Info & Education Office. At briefing conferences, I discussed with them the topic for the next week, suggesting more of the presentation, and determining general policies to be followed. I made periodic inspection visits to classes led by these men.

c) Lectured or conducted several discussions each week.

- The topics of these classes ware the same as those used by the other men: Basic U.S. History; current world events; dame ite allies; the erere; and the role of the individual soldier. Classes contained 74 to 1cc men cach, with all levels of education represented in them.

d) Designed and prepared displays for War Information Centers in camp libraries and the post Leadquarters. Developed visual aide for classroom use.

- Displays consisted of pictures, posters, maps, and explanatory material dealing with various topics, such as: "The German Army", "Growth of the Japanese Empire", "Maziiem", "The United Nations", etc. The purpose was to give a graphic presentation of background information concerning the war. The display in the post headquarters had cups and news itens dealing with battle areas.

e) Compiled and edited daily news chest; broadcast daily news summaries; wrote articles on current events for comp newspaper.

- At my suggestion, the news-dissemination media at Camp Pickett were expanded by establ establichmont of the more shoot and news breadcasts. The news cheet contained late news bulletins, factual background material, and come editorials. The news sheet and breudeusts were necessitated by the remoteness of the cap.

f) Did educational counselling and encouraged corollments in correspondence courses offered by U.S. Armed Forcec Institute.

g) Maintained close cooperation with cup newspaper staff, the Public Relations corice, Special Services Cirice, and the Intelligence Officer.

To be better prepared for work in the Fest Info & Education Office I was sent to the School for Fersonnel Services, Washington & Lue University, Lexington, Va., for a cre-conth course for Infc & Education Enlisted Specialists, (Catcher-November 1944)

This course was prepared by the Her Department and conducted by military personnel. It presented material to be used in preparing Jafo & Education progress in compe, it suggested methods of presenta- tion, and it provided practical experience in arcescing and dealing with crientation problems.

I believe my work as Non-Commissioned Officer in the Post Info & Education Office at Camp Pickett would be valuable to Central Intelligence. The job was given to me as a promotion. I received special training for it at the School for Personnel Services, while performing the job, I received promotion in rank from Private first class to Staff Sergeant. During the closing months of my service, I was in complete charge of the office in the absence of any full-time Info & Education Officer.

As the result of my work, I was invited to attend a conference of the Info & Education officers and non-commissioned officers of the Third Service Command at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and to address that conference on educational and counselling problems. Since my discharge, was in process at that time, I was unable to attend. Upon discharge, I received a special commendation from Colonel F.G. Paullin, Commanding officer of Camp Pickett, and a letter of recommendation from my superior.

(Copies of these letters, orders, and commendations will be submitted if necessary)

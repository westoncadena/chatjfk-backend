Mr. Stewart telephonically advised on September 24, 1975, that he had been contacted by James Dick of the Senate Select Committee and again asked to appear for interview concerning mail openings. Mr. Stewart explained to Mr. Dick that he was arranging with the Department of Justice for legal representation and until these arrangements were completed, he did not feel it was appropriate for him to be interviewed. According to Mr. Stewart, Mr. Dick informed him that the Committee could not wait for such arrangements to be completed and that arrangements should be mede at this time for the interview. Mr. Stewart stated, Mr. Dick implied that, if he did not agree to an interview in the immediate future, a subpoena would be issued. As a result, Mr. Stewart agreed to appear September 26, 1975, for interview by the Senate Select Cormittes concerning vail openings. He, however, did not indicate whether he intends to furnish information at that time.

Reference is made to the memorandum dated August 13, 1975, from Mr. Douglas R. Marvin, Counselor to the Attorney General, to Mr. W. Raymond Wannall, of this Eureau, captioned, "Senate Select Committee Request for Information on Warrantless Electronic Surveillances," which enclosed an SSC request dated July 7, 1975, and/ to my memoranda, captioned as above, dated August 25, 1975, September 16, 1975, and September 19, 1975.

Enclosed is the original of a memorandum containing responses to questions 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as they pertain to FEI war- rantless microphone and telephone surveillances. My memorandum to you dated September 16, 1975, indicated these responses were being prepared separately.

In conformity with our prior responses to these SSC requests, the identity of the requesting Presidential appointee is omitted. This criteria did not become applicable until the recent Presidential Directive which is the subject of the SSC request question #23b, the response to which the Department has reserved for itself. Our response therefore states all electronic surveillance requests are signed by the Director or Acting Director of the FEI.

TOP SECRET

A briefing for Senators Church and Tower has been provided covering warrantless electronic surveillances, surreptitious entry for recovery of cryptographic material, teletype coverage requested by the National Security Agency and electronic penetration of communications equipment requested by the National Security Agency. The White House asked that agencies of the intelligence community not respond to any requests from the SSC covering these matters until the briefing had been given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowledge of these matters to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information throughout the SOC staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the enclosed material not be made available to the SSC staff until it is discussed with the White House. I further urge that it be made clear to the White House that if this material is to be made available to the SSC that access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower, and SCC Staff Director William Miller only.

A copy of the memorandum is enclosed for your records.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams DATE: 9/18/75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: LEGAL ADVICE FOR PRESENT OR FORMER BUREAU EMPLOYEES

On September 17, 1975, Mary Wagner, an attorney in the office of the Deputy Attorney General, accompanied by Bruce Baird, an attorney recently appointed to the Deputy's office, met with me in my office and advised that they have been assigned the responsibility of drafting guidelines for the Attorney General's approval concerning legal representation of Department employees. She explained that they view the problem of legal advice to employees as larger than the request made by the FBI concerning Bureau employees, and that the guidelines would address the larger problem. She asked for my suggestions concerning the proposed guidelines.

I told Miss Wagner that in the beginning of the inquiries received from the Senate and House Select Committees, we had been advised by the Department that a conflict of interest would prohibit Department attorneys, including lawyers in the FBI, from providing legal representation individually to the employees of the FBI in matters relating to the Senate and House inquiries. As a consequence we have been advising our employees of the procedures involved in Congressional committee interviews and appearances for testimony; the limitations imposed on the employees in regard to sensitive areas of testimony which might require special approval; their right to counsel and of the limitation imposed on us that personal counsel would have to be privately employed. I told Miss Wagner that my reading of the Attorney General's memorandum for the Director dated September 12, 1975, was that the Attorney General intended to make personal legal advice available to employees requesting it and that we would like for the guidelines to be written broadly enough for employees to receive effective assistance of legal counsel.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

I suggested to her that the Attorney General might approve the appointment of a special counsel within the Department whose responsibilities would be somewhat similar to those imposed on the Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in that he would be relieved of other Department responsibilities and his allegiance would be only to discharging the obligations of personal counsel when requested by an employee. I suggested that such special designation would permit the Department lawyer so assigned to avoid the conflict of interest problem and at the same time it would impose on him the obligations of the attorney-client privilege.

Miss Wagner commented that she understood that in some cases handled by the Civil Division of the Department, Government attorneys represent employees in civil suits, but require that the employee waive the attorney-client privilege to the extent that should the Government employee become aware of information that should be communicated to another division of the Department, the attorney would furnish such information to the other division. If the attorney learned of criminal conduct on the part of the employee, he would not be prohibited by the attorney-client privilege from making such conduct known to the Department.

I told Miss Wagner that an essential element of the relationship between the special counsel for furnishing advice to employees would be that the attorney-client privilege would apply and it would not be possible for such a waiver to be required in exchange for providing legal advice. She agreed.

I suggested to Miss Wagner that the Department special counsel could be available for consultation concerning such matters as appearances before Congressional committees and for such preliminary advice as would be useful to employees called to testify. At the point where the special counsel determined that the employee required more in-depth legal assistance in order to protect his legal rights, the special counsel could recommend to the Deputy Attorney General that the employee should be afforded an opportunity to have private counsel whose fees would be paid by the Department of Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

In regard to the question of security clearance for such outside counsel and the possibility that an employee might seek to employ an attorney whose background would suggest that he would not be approved for security clearance, I told Miss Wagner that the provision of private counsel to an employee would be done in the discretion of the Department and that a reasonable limitation could well be imposed by the Department as to those attorneys in private practice who would be eligible for appointment to represent individual employees. Such limitation would permit the Department and the employee to agree upon an attorney who would be qualified for security clearance.

Miss Wagner inquired as to when the Department's responsibility for furnishing legal counsel to an employee should terminate. I told her that an appropriate time would be when the Department advised the employee that a decision had been made to prosecute the employee. Up to that point the inquiries would have been directed toward the determination of the circumstances and that the employer-employee relationship would justify protecting the legal rights of the employee, but at the point at which the Government determines and so advises the employee that the employee would be prosecuted, the Government and the employee would become adversaries.

We discussed the provision in Federal law for the appointment of counsel for Federal defendants in cases where the defendant is indigent. I suggested that they consider the possibility that even in those cases where an employee is to be prosecuted, the Department consider the possibility of employing existing law to provide counsel to employees who may become defendants in criminal cases.

As to the scope of the representation of the employee, I told Miss Wagner that the initial need is for legal advice in situations where an employee is called for an interview or testimony by Members, committees, subcommittees, or other units of the Congress. However, I explained that due to the publicity of the Congressional inquiries, others may well be interested in pursuing independent inquiries concerning the same matters or other matters and that employees may well request legal advice when they are called for interview or testimony by the Criminal

# Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees

Division of the Department, the Civil Rights Division of the Department, or other Federal Government entities including Federal Grand Juries. Further, state and local prosecutors and grand juries may seek to inquire concerning matters within their jurisdiction arising out of the employee's Federal activities and the employee would require the assistance of counsel. Therefore, I asked Miss Wagner to include in the guidelines a provision that legal counsel would be available through the Department for employees in all circumstances where the employee is being questioned concerning matters arising out of his employment in the FBI.

I told Miss Wagner that the concluding paragraph in the Attorney General's memorandum for the Director indicated the possibility that a determination would be made in some cases that the employee's activities were beyond the scope of his duties and in such cases legal counsel would not be provided. I told her that such a determination would be critical and the policy followed in making such decisions would color the entire program of providing legal assistance to employees. Therefore, I requested Miss Wagner to address the question of scope of duties in the guidelines by expressing a presumption that the employee's activities were within the scope of his duties and that such presumption would be overcome only by a showing of facts clearly indicating to the contrary, and that such determination would be made at least by the Deputy Attorney General himself.

I told Miss Wagner that this matter was most urgent and that the Special Agents of the FBI throughout the field are anxiously awaiting the announcement of the Attorney General's policy in regard to availability of legal advice to employees concerning matters arising out of their employment. She advised me that work would begin immediately and that she would be in touch with me concerning its progress, and to discuss the guidelines as they are developed.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information of the Direcor in response to his request.

JOSEPH K. PONDER BY ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
SSC STAFF MEMBER

Set out below is information concerning an interview
of former FBI Assistant Director Joseph K. Ponder by an SSC
Staff Member.

In August 28, 1975, Ponder telephonically contacted
FBI Headquarters from California and advised that he had been
contacted by one Mike Epstein who identified himself as a
Staff Member of the SSC. Epstein indicated he wanted to
interview Ponder regarding the Martin Luther King, Jr., case.
Ponder advised that he was Special Agent in Charge in the
Atlanta, Georgia, Field Office during the King investigation
and indicated that Epstein was to recontact him in Los Angeles

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

on Sunday, August 31, 1975. Ponder was advised that the FBI was waiving his secrecy agreement for purpose of the interview, but only as it concerned a discussion of matters relating to the King investigation. Ponder was additionally advised that he should not furnish information which would identify confidential sources, disclose sensitive methods or investigative techniques, jeopardize ongoing investigations, or violate third agency commitments. Ponder was told that if he had any questions regarding the proper scope of the interview, he could further consult with FBI Headquarters by collect call.

Attached herewith is a memorandum prepared by Ponder and voluntarily furnished by him to the Los Angeles Field Office of the FBI. His memorandum reports the interview of him by Epstein.

Enclosure

NOTE: Telephonic contacts between Ponder and FBIHQ are set forth in memorandum 8/28/75 from T. W. Leavitt to Mr. W. R. Wannall and memorandum 8/29/75 from Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, both memoranda concerning SENSTUDY 75. The Legal Counsel Division advice to Ponder was given by Inspector J. B. Hotis.

The LHM we are furnishing the Department was received by Los Angeles airtel 9/5/75 which contained the following additional significant information. Ponder dictated to the Los Angeles Office the following impressions for the Bureau's information:

"Following this interview and upon further reflection I believe Atlanta did have some coverage on King at the time I arrived in Atlanta. I believe that

NOTE CONTINUED:

coverage was on his home as opposed to the coverage on his offices at Southern Christian Leadership Conference which we obtained while I was there.

"Based on my brief discussion with Epstein and his manner in making the appointment, I hed the feeling that his interview of me was arranged over the Labor Day weekend to suit his personal convenience or to fit his personal travel plans. He was pleasant, low-keyed, and not at all aggressive or probing and I had the impression that he learned nothing during the interview that he had not known before. I told him on several occasions during the interview that my memory of this ten year old matter is very poor, that he should rely on the records made at the time for a more accurate account."

"I also had the impression that he is pursuing leads based on material furnished to him by Sullivan."

The foregoing impressions of Ponder are not being included in the material being furnished to the Depertment as it appears obvious Ponder intended this information for the exclusive information of the Bureau.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day weekend and asked whether I would be available for interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would. Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon, August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between 3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta (New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King. I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told him I was not aware of any. In response to these and other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that I had not been personally involved in the King matter, that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information which might answer his questions. I told him that everything that was done was properly recorded, that the records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs from the record, he should rely on the record to determine what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed outside your agency.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told him I did not recall, but that in any case it was approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I do not now recall whether I was told why they were discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the reason. He asked whether we had a bug on King as opposed to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were possible there were taps and 'bugs placed and maintained without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible because of the size of the office and the relationship I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize. I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name I cannot now recali. He asked whether Sullivan had met with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill, that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office, but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a meeting took place it was in the nature of a social call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry made by the Bureau into the handling of the King investigation either through the Inspection Staff or otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella. I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor Charles Harding.

(8) Martin Luther King, Jr., Investigation. (The Bureau will be the principal topic of this hearing.)

(9) COINTELPRO. (The Bureau will be the principal topic of this hearing.)

(10) A review of the Bureau filing system and the official and confidential files. (Elliff stated this hearing would be similar to the Bureau's appearance and testimony before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, Committee on the Judiciary, on February 27, 1975.)

(11) Bureau's involvement in the Fred Hampton Black Panther Party in Chicago, Illinois. (The Bureau will be the principal topic of this hearing.)

Elliff indicated that the Bureau will ordinarily be given transcripts of what witnesses have furnished the Committee concerning the topic of the hearing prior to the hearing and will be given a list of documents which will be used during the particular hearing prior to that hearing. Gitenstein stated that this was intended so that the Bureau could be responsive to questions asked during the particular hearing. Additionally, Gitenstein indicated that the Bureau will be requested from time to time to declassify documents and that this will be done by making the request ten days, if possible, prior to the Committee's intended use.

Elliff in a subsequent conversation indicated that this procedure had not been worked out by the Committee and that there were many options being considered concerning the declassification matter. One of the means being discussed by the Committee is to have a suitably paraphrased substitute for the document to be used in hearings.

With regard to Item 35 of request #1 which requested advice as to whether there is any information contained in the John Rosselli electronic surveillance logs concerning 18 individuals or situations, a check of our electronic surveillance indices revealed references to three of the individuals; namely, Sam Giancana, Frank Sinatra, and Robert Maheu, as having been overheard through electronic surveillance coverage on John Rosselli. Without further advice as to the identity of "any White House person" or "any DOJ person" no logical search of electronic surveillance indices can be made.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY DY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Set out below is information concerning an interview
of FBI SA Fred J. Cassidy by a Staff Member of the SSC. Cassidy
is currently assigned to FBI Headquarters. The details of the
interview are as furnished by Cassidy.

On advance notice from Mr. Loch Johnson, SSC Staff
Menber, Cassidy was advised that he was to be interviewed on
August 20, 1975. Cassidy was informed by the Legal Counsel
Division of the FBI that he was being released from any
applicable employment agreement for purposes of the SSC interview
concerning the Huston Plan. It was explained to Cassidy that
he had a right to counsel; however, the FBI was unable to provide
private counsel. Cassidy was also told that there were certain
privileged areas concerning which he would not be required to
answer questions. These areas concern information which might
divulge the identities of FBI sources; information relating to
sensitive methods and techniques; information which might adversely
affect ongoing FBI investigations; and information which had
originated with other agencies, including foreign intelligence
agencies. Cassidy was informed that if a question arose during
the interview in one of these areas, he had the privilege, before
replying, of consulting with an FBI representative.

The following is a first-person statement prepared by
Cassidy reporting the interview of him.

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 20, 1975, Mir. Loch Johnson of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC) staff interviewed me in my office, Room 4821, JEH Building, concerning my knowledge of, and participation in, the so-called "Huston Plan."

Mr. Johnson did not place me under oath or advise me of my rights.

He asked about my background which I provided, including the fact that I have been a Special Agent of the FBI since August 7, 1050.

With regard to the extent of my participation in the Huston Plan, I advised Mr. Johnson that I was selected by former Assistant Director William C. Sullivan to act as the liaison officer for the plan, probably because of my experience in the FBI Domestic Liaison Section and my extensive liaison contacts through my participation in the various United States Intelligence Board (USIB) Committees. My duties with regard to the Huston Plan were to insure that appropriate notification of meetings was made and that the various papers prepared as the result of meetings held were delivered to the proper individuals in the other agencies participating in the plan. Some of the papers were delivered personally by me, others were sent by courier.

I advised Mr. Johnson that I was generally aware of the contents of the papers prepared through my attendance at the meetings of the working group and discussions with participating personnel; however, I personally made no input nor did I participate in the preparation of the workpapers or the finished product.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Johnson asked if I had met Ton Charles Huston prior to the initial meeting of the Huston Plan working group. I advised him that I had never heard of Huston prior to the mentioning of his name by W. C. Sullivan at the initial mecting of FBI personnel involved in the Huston Plan, which meeting occurred early in June, 1970, and had never seen him until the first meeting of the working group held at CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia, shortly thereafter.

Mr. Johnson asked about the initial meeting of FBI personnel concerning the Huston Plan. I told him it was held in Mr. Sullivan's conference room in the Federal Triangle Building and that as best as I could recall it was attended by Mr. Sullivan and the branch Inspectors of the Intelligence Division as well as the Section Chiefs. Sullivan told us of the plan and as I recall indicated this was a golden opportunity to regain the coverage afforded by techniques, which had been denied us for the most part, since 1967. I told him that in my view Sullivan was going to make this one last effort to regain the coverage and if this effort failed was prepared to retiro.

Mr. Johnson asked if former Inspector T. J. Smith was at this meeting. I told him I could not recall.

The initial meeting of the Ad Hoc group at CIA was discussed and I advised him that, as I recalled, at that meeting it was decided that cach participating agency would submit a paper listing the restraints on their particular agency which were hampering them in doing their job. I pointed out that the FBI submitted an extensive list of restraints and that this paper was circulated to the other participating agencies without being cleared through Mr. Hoover.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFT MEMBER

Mr. Johnson asked if I was aware of who was the
instigator of the Huston Plan. I told him I had no direct
knowledge but would suspect it was W. C. Sullivan, Huston, or
possibly formor Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian;
however, the answer to his question would have to be obtained
from those individuals or such records as he may be able to
locate.

He asked my impression of Ton Charles Huston. I told
hin I felt Iluston was a very bright young man who saw this plan
as an opportunity to become the Henry Kissinger of domestic
security and thereby enhance himself and his political career.

Mr. Johnson stated that his investigation had developed
that Sullivan at the outset of the plan appeared to want to push
through the plan; however, he seemed to take a direct turnabout
and began to advise lir. Hoover against adopting some of the
proposals being made by the various participating agencies. He
said it was his impression that this turnabout occurred at the
time Sullivan was promoted to Number Three Man in the Bureau.
He asked if I could shed any light on this turn of events.

I told Mr. Johnson that I could not speak for Sullivan
and could only give him my impression of what occurred, that being
at the outset of the plan Sullivan truly folt this was a golden
opportunity to get the coverage back, and decided to lay his job
on the line to accomplish ish this. When he was moved up to the
Number Three job, I felt he saw the opportunity to someday become
the Director of the FBI. Further, as the drafts of the plan were
being written, Sullivan realized that sooner or later Mr. Hoover
would see them and at that time realize that Sullivan had dissen-
inated to the intelligence community all of the restraints
Mr. Hoover had imposed on the FBI.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Sullivan then tried to have the other agencies
listed as the agencieswhich submitted the restraints. Having
accomplished this, he was then in a position to advise Mr. Hoover
that this or that was not wise or necessary. When the final
report was prepared, the FBI then footnoted most of the recom
mendations as opposing them,

Mr. Johnson said he had been advised by Mr. Helns and
Admiral Gaylor that the final draft which they reviewed prior to
going to Mr. Hoover's office to sign it did not contain the
footnotes and that they were not aware that the FBI was objecting
to the recommendations until they saw the final version of the
report in Mr. Hoover's office.

I told him that I cannot specifically recall what was
in the final draft; however, I was aware that all of the working
Croup was aware of the FBI position as it was so stated at the
neeting in which the draft was hannered out. I told him I
specifically recalled this as it had put ur. Sullivan in a most
enbarrassing position. At one point when asked why a change was
to be made or why the FBI was going to object, Sullivan responded
with words to the effect that because I'r. Hoover caid so.

Mr. Johnson asked why covert mail coverage was listed
as a restraint as CIA was engaged in such coverage in 1970. I
told him I was not in a position to discuss CIA operations with
him. He also asked about the removal of restrictions or use of
surreptitious entries to obtain cryptographic materials. I told
him I was not free to discuss such activity with him.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemination outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel without the express approval of the FBI.

Reference is made to the letter from the Chairman of the SSC to the Attorney General dated August 28, 1975, requesting delivery of previously requested FBI materials pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jr. Reference is also made to prior FBI communications which have, on a continuing basis, effected delivery to the SSC of materials concerning King and responsive to SSC requests dated July 8 and 14, 1975.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery to the SSC of information and materials relating to the SSC request dated July 14, 1975, and specifically, to the following Items in this request: 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, and 22.

Materials relating to Items 16, 18 and 22 are being delivered with this memorandum.

In respect to Items 3, 4 and 6, we are delivering two documents dated October 15 and 18, 1963. We have been, however, unable to locate from a review of logical FBI files, any further documentation which would be responsive to the SSC inquiries in Items 3, 4 and 6.

In respect to Item 11, we are delivering two documents dated November 22 and 27, 1964, concerning the 1964 revision of a 1963 FBI monograph. The November 27, 1964, document is also responsive to Item 12.

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

In respect to Items 14 and 15, we are delivering
a document dated December 17, 1964. As indicated on page 2
of this document, it was approved for Mr. Sullivan by
someone whose initials appear to the right of "WCS/."
Although we cannot say with absolute certainty who that person
might have been, the initials appear to be those of former
FBI Special Agent (SA) Daniel J. Brennan, Former SA E. R.
Clayton approved the communication for Mr. Tolson. Notations
on page 2 indicate that Mr. Belmont approved it and also
advised FBI Director Hoover of its contents on December 18,
presumably 1964. No written approval by Mr. Hoover is noted.

In respect to Item 21, we are delivering a document
dated August 24, 1967, We have previously furnished the
SSC, by memorandum dated June 24, 1975, and subtitled "Request
Pertaining to Electronic Surveillance," an excised copy of
the August 24, 1967, document. The copy which is now being
delivered contains certain administrative data which had been
excised on previous delivery. However, those excisions
remaining relate to the substance of the memorandum and were
made to protect the identity of a representative of a friendly
foreign intelligence service, the name of that service and
the name of the country involved.

With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some
cases, it can be ascertained precisely what information in
FBI files came from electronic surveillances of Dr. King;
however, there exist areas where documentation of the
information is not precise and no accurate determination can
be made. Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions
of the material being furnished do not contain information
developed as a result of electronic surveillances of King.

SUBJECT: COMMUNISM AND THE NEGRO MOVEMENT--
A CURRENT ANALYSIS

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/18/00 BY S

The enclosed article, captioned as above, is the one we have been preparing in line with approval of our recommendation to disseminate it on a select basis at a very high level to show current communist activities in relation to the Negro movement. It incorporates up-to-date material just received from our New York Office relating to the recent meeting of the Communist Party's National Executive Committee. Discussion of racial matters was a primary topic at the week-long meeting.

The enclosed article is a factual, documented analysis of the over-all current situation. We believe that it would be of interest not only to the Attorney General but also to Mr. O'Donnell, at the White House; Mr. McCone, at the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Department of State; as well as to Mr. McNamara and the three Armed Forces intelligence agencies of the Defense Department. Accordingly, if the article as prepared is approved, we propose to disseminate it to the afore-mentioned individuals and agencies.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the enclosed article be approved. If approved, it should be returned to the Domestic Intelligence Division for preparation of appropriate letters of transmittal.

SUBJECT: COMMUNISM AND THE NEGRO MOVEMENT--A CURRENT ANALYSIS

Enclosed is a paper, captioned as above, which depicts the communist influence in the Negro movement with emphasis on Martin Luther King, Jr. This paper is an up-to-date revision of the one by the same title prepared under the date of October 16, 1963. In updating it we emphasized three main areas: (1) the continued dependence of King upon former Communist Party, USA members, current and former Party sympathizers and his continued reliance on the long-time communist [Stanley David Levison]; (2) facts relating to the moral degeneracy of King; and (3) the recent and current Party aims and activities relative to the racial movement.

RECOMMENDATION:

Upon approval, consideration will be given to appropriate dissemination. When approved, the paper should be returned to the Domestic Intelligence Division for printing, and the preparation of appropriate letters if disseminated.

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Memorandum

W. Ca Sullivan

FROM: F. J. Baumgardner

SUBJECT: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

This memorandum recommends that the National Science Foundation (NSF) be furnished information concerning the communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCIC) and its President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by the NSF for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools.

AT 1332-S* has furnished information that Cordy T. Vivian, SCIC Director of Affiliates, was advised that the NSF desired qualified applicants to enter the University of Mississippi and other schools in southern states where the NSF has its program in progress. Vivian was advised that the NSF was contacting organizations such as the SCIC and other civil rights groups to handle the recruitment program for negro students they did not want it to appear that the NSF was attempting to put Negro applicants in southern schools.

Vivian was advised that each qualified applicant would receive a $3,000 scholarship from the NSF. Since this is a Government project any expenses incurred in this matter would not come out of anyone's pocket." This would indicate that any expenses incurred by the SCLC in their recruitment effort would be paid for with Government funds.

The communist influences exerted on King are well known to the Bureau. Vivian has in the past been a member of the Communist Party.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is incredible that an outfit such as the SCIC should be utilized for the purpose of recruiting Negroes to take part in the NSF program, particularly where funds of the

Memorandum to W. C. Sullivan
From F. J. Baumgardner
RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF

U. S. Government are involved. The Atlanta Office has recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D, Georgia) be advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director, NSF, should be, furnished information regarding communist influences exerted on the SCLC and King. In this regard we recently disseminated to the White House and the heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret" summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Movement--A Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the SCIC and King. This summary deals with King's communist connections and his personal immoral activities. With the receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCLC would undoubtedly be removed from the NSF program to obtain qualified Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the Department and interested intelligence agencies.

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to Dr. Leland J. Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Movement--A Current Analysis."

information of a political or subversive nature concerning
King so that his Director-General can brief the Prime Minister
of Australia.

Mr. Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed, that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought up to date.

This is an excellent suggestion and we have already started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Washington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level officials in Government of the wholly disreputable character of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our Washington Field Office has developed information that King's group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals to participate in the demonstration and the date for the project has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough job on this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring together the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it in a hard-hitting manner. To make the brief timely, we will have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

Reference is made to memorandum from lir. Michael E. Shaheen of the Lepartment of Justice to Er. John A. Mintz of this Bureau, captioned "Sonate Select Committee Request," dated September 9, 1975. Reference is also made to lotter dated September 5, 1975, to Mr. Shaheen from Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the SSC staff.

The issue raised in roforenced communications is whether onployees of the Internal Revenue Service who supplied tax returns or tax return information to Special Agents of the FBI in response to formal or informal requests are to be characterized as "confidential sources" and, as such, to be spared being interviewed by the SSC.

It is the position of this Bureau that regardless of the formality or informality of requests made in the above context they cannot be characterized as "confidential" since they represent official responsos to official requests. Therefore, we cannot consider them in the same light as the "confidential sources" issue raised earlier in Cointelpro matters.

# The Attorney General

NOTE:

Issue raised by the SSC here is that they have detected in their investigation of the Internal Revenue Service and through review of Cointelpro documents furnished to them by the FBI instances relating to FBI use of tax return information. Included in this material were a number of cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according to the documents, received tax returns or tax return information from Internal Revenue Service employees. Earlier the SSC had sought to interview individuals who assisted us in several of our Cointelpro operations. We successfully resisted these attempts to obtain the identities of such individuals and our assent to such interview by the SSC. We were sustained in our position by the Attorney General, Our position was based on the fact that we considered that we had an obligation, expressed or implied, of confidentiality toward such sources who had acted on our behalf.

The SSC now raises a question as to whether our position concerning contacts with and identities of employees of the Internal Revenue Service is the same as with the "confidential sources." For the reasons cited in our letter we do not believe it would be possible to sustain such an argument.

The attached letter is self-explanatory and, put in distilled form, asks the following question:

Are employees of the IRS who supplied tax returns or tax return information to agents of the FBI in response to formal or informal requests made by Bureau agents to be characterized as "confidential sources" and, as such, to be spared being interviewed by the Select Committee?

Because the Attorney General and the Bureau have previously addressed the Bureau's position on the nondisclosure of its sources for interview purposes by the SSC staff, and because the issue raised in the attached letter may represent a clear exception to the earlier resolution of the Bureau's COINTELPRO-sources problem, I am forwarding this to you for your prompt attention and views for early transmittal to the Attorney General. I shall appreciate the receipt of your views on or before COB Thursday, September 11, 1975.

Dear Mike:

![ALL FBI INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN 13 DNCLASSIFIED DATE 10/18/60 BY SP2ALM]

In connection with our investigation of the
Internal Revenue Service, we have received a number of FBI
COINTELPRO documents relating to FBI use of tax return
information. Included in this material are a number of
cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according
to the documents, received tax returns or tax return in-
formation from IRS employees, such as the local Chief of
Audit or Chief of Intelligence.

We wish to determine whether these requests
were treated by the IRS as official requests and pre-
scribed procedures thus followed for disclosure of the
information, or whether the requests were treated as
informal requests and prescribed procedures ignored. We
cannot make this determination solely on the basis of the
FBI documents we have reviewed. In many cases, the only
way to determine how the requests were treated will be to
interview the IRS employees who handled the requests.

Since these requests were directed to a federal
agency, we are proceeding on the basis of a presumption
that the responses were properly cleared. If so, we do
not believe there is any basis for characterizing the IRS
employees in question as "confidential sources". They
would then be in essentially the same position as the Com-.
missioner of Internal Revenue is where the request is
directed through normal channels to the National Office

and responded to officially. In the event it should turn out that the responses were not officially approved, they were nonetheless made by federal employees who should have been acting within the scope of their official duties and who, if they were not so acting, should certainly be subject to interrogation regarding the circumstances of their acting outside their authority.

In what is perhaps an excess of caution in view of the pending discussions regarding the questioning of "confidential sources", we are submitting this situation for your review lest you should disagree with our analysis that these individuals cannot properly be so characterized. Because IRS hearings are scheduled for the last week in September, our need to question the people who released the returns is very urgent, and we would appreciate your advising us of your view on the subject at the earliest possible moment -- hopefully no later than Monday, September 8th.

On 9/9/75, John Elliff, Domestic Task Force Head of the Senate Select Committee, telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly and requested that SA Douglas MacDougall be released for purposes of submitting to a Staff interview concerning mail openings.

Elliff stated that he was currently being interviewed by Senate Select Committee Staff Members on mail covers; however, he indicated there is an apparent misunderstanding as the Senate Select Committee also requested that he be made available for Staff interview on mail openings at the same time. Elliff was advised that this was not true and that James Dick of the Senate Select Committee had requested only a release insofar as mail covers was concerned for purposes of an interview with MacDougall and that this particular topic had been confirmed with Dick on a separate occasion to insure that their intent insofar as MacDougall was concerned was to interview him on mail covers. Elliff then requested that MacDougall be released for mail openings and in- quired as to how long this particular procedure might take. He was informed that prior to MacDougall's being made available for such an interview the Bureau would brief MacDougall concerning his Fifth Amendment rights and would want MacDougall to have sufficient time to consider whether he might want to retain private counsel or whatever other steps he feels necessary to protect his rights.

Elliff subsequently recontacted SA Paul V. Daly telephonically and stated he had checked with James Dick, Senate Select Committee Staff Member, and determined that Dick had only asked that MacDougall be made available for interview concerning mail covers. Elliff stated that since

MacDougall had traveled from New York for purposes of this particular interview, they felt that it would be in their interest to also interview MacDougall concerning mail openings. He requested that MacDougall be released for purposes of the mail openings interview. He also informed SA Daly that after the mail covers interview, MacDougall will return to the Bureau so that he can be appropriately briefed by the Legal Counsel Division concerning his Fifth Amendment rights.

That SA MacDougall be released from existing employment agreement for purposes of interview by the Senate Select Committee concerning mail openings.

MacDougall advised that he would prefer contacting private counsel before submitting to an interview concerning mail openings. He indicated that he was attempting to make arrangements to consult with the attorney in person. SA MacDougall advised that he would telephonically contact the Legal Counsel Division subsequent to his conference with the attorney and advise whether he desires to submit to an interview concerning mail openings. His decision in this matter will be brought to the attention of the Senate Select Committee.

"Following this interview and upon further
reflection I believe Atlanta did have some coverage on
KING at the time I arrived in Atlanta. I believe that
coverage was on his home as opposed to the coverage on
his offices at Southern Christian Leadership Conference
which we obtained while I was there."

Labor Day weekend to suit his personal convenience or to fit his personal travel plans. He was pleasant, low-keyed, and not at all aggressive or probing and I had the impression that he learned nothing during the interview that he had not known before. I told him on several occasions during the interview that my memory of this ten year old matter is very poor, that he should rely on the records made at the time for a more accurate account.

"I also had the impression that he is pursuing leads based on material furnished to him by Sullivan."

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day weekend and asked whether I would be available for interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would. Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon, August 31, 1975.

The interview with Epstein took place between 3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in amenities and general conversation.

Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta (New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King. I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told him I was not aware of any. In response to these and other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that I had not been personally involved in the King matter, that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information which might answer his questions. I told him that every- thing that was done was properly recorded, that the records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs from the record, he should rely on the record to determine what happened.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed outside your agency.

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

He asked whether the request for the King
coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told
him I did not recall, but that in any case it was
approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in
which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He
asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I
do not now recall whether I was told why they were
discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the
reason. He asked whether we had a bug on King as opposed
to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were
possible there were taps and bugs placed and maintained
without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible
because of the size of the office and the relationship
I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was
done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.

Epstein asked whether we had conducted any
Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled
none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent
King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere
with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a
banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.
I told him I knew of no such efforts.

He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director
William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him
Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional
conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the
Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan
and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met
with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,
that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,
but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a meeting took place it was in the nature of a social call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding any anti-King activities and I told him, "no." He asked whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta and I told him I knew of none.

He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry made by the Bureau into the handling of the King investigation either through the Inspection Staff or otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella. I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor Charles Harding.

DATE 10/15/82 BY SPLAL/djj

On 9-4-75, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Noah Smith, Attorney, Office of General Counsel, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), telephoned Special Agent Richard T. Taylor, Jr., advising he recently received a written request from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) for access to the Federal income tax returns of one "William Simon, a former FBI Agent residing in the Los Angeles, California, area." Mr. Smith explained IRS receives approximately three million returns from their Los Angeles district and that upon review of IRS indices he is unable to identify "William Simon," the object of the Committee's interest. He noted SSC provided no additional identifying data concerning Simon and did not furnish any indication as to the reason for their interest in him.

Mr. Smith requested the address and Social Security Numbers of retired SAs of the FBI with the surname "Simon" who have resided in the Los Angeles area during the past three years. SA Taylor informed Mr. Smith his request will be forwarded to our Administrative Division for consideration as to its appropriateness and feasibility.

At 1:15 p.m. on 9-4-75, Mr. Smith telephoned SA Taylor and advised he had located the income tax return of one "William Simon," a former FBI Agent, who resides in Los Angeles and is presently engaged in the practice of law there." Mr. Smith rescinded his earlier request.

Honorable Clarence E. Kelley
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

In accordance with instructions received from the Bureau, I am enclosing a bill in the amount of $750.00 from the law firm of Kantor, Shaw & Davidoff. Mr. Herbert Kantor is an attorney who acted as my counsel during an appearance by me before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Operations in Washington, D. C. on August 12, 1975.

After notification by the Committee and the Bureau that my appearance had been requested, I was advised by the Legal Department of the Bureau that I had the right to have an attorney accompany me during my appearance. I was also advised by the Bureau that neither they nor the Department of Justice could provide me with counsel due to a possible conflict of interest on their part.

The matters to be discussed before the Committee involved only my prior official duties in the counter- intelligence field. At this point, I strongly believed that to best protect both my constitutional privileges and the Bureau's overriding interest, the most prudent course of action would indicate the retention of an attorney. I would like to advise you that much thought was paid to the selection of an attorney since confidential Bureau activities would have to be discussed with him and it was felt that the person selected would, in effect, be representing the Bureau in addition to myself.

The specific legal fees incurred, as itemized in the enclosed bill, are only in connection with the preparation for and attendance at my appearance before the Committee.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

In view of the fact that my appearance was solely connected with my official duties, I respectfully request that you ascertain what avenues are available to me for the reimbursement of these legal fees.

Thank you for your kindness and consideration in this matter.

Yours truly,

![James P. Kehoe's signature]

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to the letter from the Chairman of the SSC to the Attorney General dated August 28, 1975, requesting delivery of previously-requested FBI materials pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jr. Reference is also made to prior FBI communications which have, on a continuing basis, effected delivery to the SSC of materials concerning King and responsive to SSC requests dated July 8 and 14, 1975.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery to the SSC of information and materials relating to the July 8 and 14, 1975, SSC requests, and specifically to the following items in those requests:

July 8, 1975: Items 2, 6, 8, 15, and 20

July 14, 1975: Items 19 and 20

In respect to Item 2, a through f, of the July 8, 1975, request, effort has been made to divide the material being delivered into specific categories a through f. However, in some instances material overlaps and information in one communication may actually apply to more than one category.

In respect to Items 19 and 20 of the July 14, 1975, request, we are delivering to the SSC a communication dated April 10, 1967, which relates to the 1967 revision of an FBI monograph concerning Martin Luther King, Jr. FBI records Indicate this revision was authored by Special Agents Robert L. Shackelford and Dwight M. Wells. No information can ENCLOSURE.

be located concerning any instructions by lir. Sullivan and/or lir. C. D. Brennan to subordinates in 1967 to revise any earlier monograph pertaining to King.

With respect to the excisions in meteriols being delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason for excision, the excision was mode for the reason that the information actually sumrizes or quotes from conversations monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some cases, it can be ascertained precisely what information in IBI files came from electronic surveillances of King; however, there exist croes where documentation of the information is not precise and no accurate determination can be rade. Therefore, no assurences can be given that portions of the mterial being furnished do not contain information developed as a result of electronic surveillances of King.

In connection with any response where we have included Xeroxes of newspaper articles or nove releases, we have not necessarily furnished all relating to perticular motter which may be scattered through FBI files, but have included those readily available and generally representative of the modie accounts of the particular matter. An exemplo would be those included in the responce to Item 6 of the July 8, 1975, SSC request.

With the delivery of the materials with this momorandum ve have fulfilled all requests contained in the July 14, 1975, request.

The remaining materials in SSC requests relating to King are receiving continuous attention and the results will be forwarded on a periodic basic as soon as possible.

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

Pursuant to Section III. A. of the notification attached to the Committee's letter of June 27, 1975, I am forwarding herewith an additional request for materials which relate to this matter.

The specificity of this request is not, of course, intended to limit in any way the agreement to come forward with all relevant information and materials, including documents, whether or not they have been brought to the Committee's attention or have been specifically requested by the Committee.

As Mr. Schwarz and I indicated in our meeting with you a few days ago, there are still outstanding several items relating to this matter which the Committee requested some.time ago. This request should in no way delay further the availability of the previously requested items, and we would expect that individual items will be supplied whenever they become separately ready for submission.

Your cooperation is appreciated.

Sincerely,

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI
SPECIAL AGENT (SA) EDWARD F.
GAMBER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Set out below is information concerning an interview of former FBI SA Edward F. Gamber by an SSC Staff Member.

On receipt of information by the FBI that the SSC might interview Gamber, he was contacted by the Atlanta, Georgia, Field Office of the FBI on August 15, 1975, and advised of the necessity, should he be interviewed by the SSC, to protect matters relating to sensitive Bureau operations. Such matters would relate to sources, methods, techniques, third agency consideration and ongoing investigations. He was told that if he desired, after being contacted by the SSC Staff, he could contact the FBI's Legal Counsel Division by collect call for information to assist him, including his obligations as to confidentiality of the information acquired as an FBI employee. It was emphasized to him that the FBI's offer of assistance was not intended to impede the SSC work but was done as a cooperative gesture and to safeguard sensitive Bureau information.

On August 21, 1975, Gamber advised the Atlanta Field Office that he had been contacted by Paul Wallach, SSC Staff Member, who had arranged to interview Gamber in the Atlanta area on September 2, 1975. Gamber also advised that he intended to contact the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI by collect call on August 22, 1975.

September 3, 1975
Atlanta, Georgia

On September 2, 1975, Mr. Paul G. Wallach, Counsel to the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate arrived at my office located at 6165 Barfield Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30302, at approximately 10:10 a.m. His interview with me commenced at approximately 10:15 a.m. and lasted until approximately 10:50 a.m. This interview was not conducted under oath. Mr. Wallach did not advise me of my rights. I drove Mr. Wallach to Perimeter Mall where he caught the 11:00 a.m. bus to the Airport.

During the interview Mr. Wallach asked how long I had served in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and what areas I worked in during my FBỊ career. He was told that my FBI career started on March 19, 1951, and ended with my retirement on January 27, 1973. During this time I was assigned to criminal work for two years, worked in the Soviet Intelligence field for approximately 17 years, and again handled criminal work for the last three years of my Bureau career.

Wallach wanted to know if I worked with James Kehoe. I told him that for the most part Kehoe and I were on different squads, although we both worked in the Soviet Intelligence field. We did work on the same squad during the first years of our assignment to this type of work.

Wallach wanted to know if I was aware of the operation involving the mail at Kennedy Airport and at other post offices in the New York area. I told him that officially I was not aware of these operations but that in fact I knew of the operations. Wallach wanted to know if I had ever been assigned to work in a post office and my answer was "no".

Wallach then wanted to know if I was acquainted with Sam Jaffee. After my affirmative answer he wanted to know how I met him, why I interviewed him, whether I had to have permission to interview him, what kind of information he furnished, whether I had ever asked him to do anything, and whether Jaffee was an informant. He also wanted to know when I first met Jaffee, how frequently I saw him, over what period of time I was seeing him, and when I last saw him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

I told Wallach that I could not remember dates
and other details of my relationship with Jaffee, but that
information responsive to his questions could be found
recorded in FBI files as I had prepared detailed memos
reflecting all of my contacts with Jaffee. I told Wallach
that if he were entitled to the information he was seeking,
I'd suggest that he get hold of the file on Jaffee. Wallach
said he understood my position, but that before going through
the process of getting a file "they" liked to talk to a few
individuals to see if information the Committee had was
worth pursuing.

Wallach acknowledged that it would not be possible
for me to furnish specific information, such as dates, after
the passage of such a long period of time. Thereafter, in
response to inquiry, he was told that Jaffee was in contact
with many diplomatic officials, including Soviets, in his
capacity as a CBS newsman. I could not specifically remember
how this information came to the Bureau's attention. I did
have some background information on Jaffee and it was necessary
for me to get permission before I could interview him. He
was told that I did not know specifically who authorized the
interview.

Wallach wanted to know what approach was used
during the initial interview with Jaffee. He was told that
I could not specifically recall this information, but that
John Willis and I conducted the interview. Both of us were
keenly aware of the FBI's policy of not interfering with the
Freedom of the Press and we wanted to make sure that Jaffee
understood this. We also wanted to make sure that Jaffee
understood that we did not want to place him in a difficult
or embarrassing position by talking to him and that if he
found our presence to be a problem we would leave immediately.
He was told that Jaffee proved to be most cooperative and that
thereafter we were in contact with Jaffee frequently. Wallach
wanted to know how often and he was told that sometimes we
were in contact with him two or three times a week, once
every two weeks, or perhaps once a month. He was told that
all contacts were recorded in writing in the file, along with
the results of the contact.

Concerning information which Jaffee furnished,
Wallach was told that Jaffee furnished information concerning
current events of major and minor importance on the inter-
national scene, which came to his attention as a result of

- 2 -
  NW 88326 Docld:32989653 Page 167


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

his contacts with numerous individuals in diplomatic circles. He was again told that all of this information was reduced to writing and I understood that it was disseminated to other government agencies, including the U. S. Mission to the UN and the State Department. Wallach wanted to know how I knew this to be the case. I explained that FBI policy required dissemination of information to other government agencies and I felt certain that this policy was followed in the case of memoranda prepared as a result of my contacts with Jaffee.

Wallach asked if Jaffee was an informant and I told him that Jaffee might more properly be called a Source of Information.

Wallach then wanted to know if I requested Jaffee to do anything in the course of contacts with him. Wallach was told that Jaffee may have been asked to follow up on information which he furnished or make contact with a specific individual but that this did not occur very often, if at all, since Jaffee was a free spirit, who usually did as he pleased. I then explained that during my contacts with Jaffee I received frequent calls from other FBI Agents who said that Jaffee was using my name in order to cross police lines or get information while covering a story of major importance, such as airplane hijacking. This in spite of repeated requests on my part that he cease doing this.

Wallach asked if I knew whether Jaffee had ever been followed by FBI Agents. I pointed out that Jaffee had been followed by FBI Agents and, in fact, talked to Agents who were following him, as well as Agents going about their business. He often mentioned my name to these Agents.

Wallach asked if I was aware that Jaffee did a television program on the FBI. I said that I was aware of this and in fact, at his request, arranged to have him visit Camp Smith with a camera crew to cover our firearms training program.

Wallach was told that I could not remember when I last saw Jaffee, but that I last talked to him when he returned from Hong Kong. At this time Jaffee called my home from Washington, D. C. and told my daughter that he had to talk to me immediately about an urgent problem. When I


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

returned Jaffee's call I listened to him for about five to ten minutes repeatedly telling me how the FBI or CIA or some individual had furnished information to ABC-TV which cost him his job. Jaffee would not listen to me as I tried to explain that he had to be mistaken. I then got sick of listening to him and hung up on him.

Wallach was told that this was typical of Jaffee who often thought that there was something personal involved when he failed to get an assignment or a news item, which he covered,was not shown on the evening news program. Wallach was told that Jaffee was an intelligent and personable guy with a burning ambition, who wanted to become a Walter Cronkite or a Marvin Kalb overnight. Wallach was told that I did not believe that Jaffee completed college and he was probably not otherwise qualified for some of these positions, which he would like to have had immediately. I then told Wallach that in my opinion Jaffee had the same problem at ABC that he had at CBS and at both places he was probably overly aggressive and not amenable to direction.

Wallach was also told that Willis and I found Jaffee to be an interesting guy who we enjoyed talking to but that he positively would not accept advice or direction.

Wallach wanted to know if I was acquainted with Special Agents Reeves, Winton or Graves and I gave a negative reply. It should be noted that Wallach had a first name for each of these individuals but I do not recall these names. He then wanted to know if I knew Bert Turner. I did know Bert Turner as a Supervisor in WFO and possibly at the Bureau.

Wallach wanted to know if I would be surprised to learn that Jaffee had been interviewed by Bureau Agents for four days upon his return from Hong Kong. I said that I would be surprised.

He also wanted to know if I would be surprised to learn that the FBI or CIA had furnished information to ABC-TV which cost Jaffee his job. I said that I would be most surprised and that I did not believe there was any possibility that this could happen. I told Wallach that in my opinion Jaffee was perfectly capable of losing his job on his own.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

Wallach then asked if I had ever talked to any other newspaper people. I told him that I once talked to Irving R. Levine many years ago. He wanted to know if I knew of any other Agents of the FBI who were talking to people in the news media. I said that I did not.

Wallach then made reference to newspaper articles of recent date concerning the FBI's relationship with newspaper people friendly to the FBI, In response to inquiry I told him that I knew absolutely nothing about this.

At the outset of the interview Wallach asked if I told the FBI about his visit and I said that I had called the Atlanta FBI Office and that as soon as he left I would again call the Atlanta FBI Office and give an Agent a rundown on the interview. He said that the FBI had notified the Select Committee about my call.

He wanted to know if I had called the FBI in Washington and I gave a negative reply. He also wanted to know if I had talked to John Willis. I had not.

Before leaving Wallach commented that he did not know who cost Jaffee his job, but that he, Wallach, was certain someone caused Jaffee to lose his job.

I believe I have covered the interview in its entirety, however, I did not make any notes and the possibility of some minor omission does exist.

In respect to Item 6 (c), there are enclosed,
communications (see Exhibits A through X) disclosing the
authorization of the above-described elsurs.

As previously set forth, a misur vas installed on

at

A thorough, exhaustive search was conducted of
numerous FBI files in an effort to locate an FBI Headquarters
(FBIHQ) communication disclosing an authorization to place
this misur. However, the search was unsuccessful. There was
located. however, a Radiogram dated
from
the
(see Exhibit F) revealing that a misur
was installed which in effect acknowledged that Bureau
instructions were carried out regarding this misur coverage
and indicates that Bureau authority was obtained.

In regard to the matter involving the authorization
of misurs, the procedures in effect at the time most of these
misurs were in operation did not require specific written
authority from the Attorney General. At that time, authority
for FBI misurs was maintained at FBIHQ and authorization for
utilizing a misur was made by the FBI Director or his
designees based on a memorandum from Attorney General
Herbert Brownell dated May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI
authority to institute such surveillances. (see Exhibit W).
Subsequent to March 30, 1965, the aforementioned procedure
was changed wherein the FBI, in requesting authority for the
installation of a misur, in each instance forwarded such
request to the Attorney General for his approval or disapproval.
(see Exhibit X). Other exhibits enclosed with this memorandum
and pertaining to the approval of misurs by FBI officials
contain the initials of the late Director J. Edgar Hoover or
his designees to make such approvals.

Re: Request Pertaining to Electronic
Surveillance

In respect to tesurs, on facilities under the control of the SCLC and approved by the Attorney General, the reason for the placing of such tesurs lies in the fact that the SCLC and Martin Luther King, Jr. as its president, were subjects of intensified FBI investigations at that time. (see Exhibits A and B). Thus, an integral phase of the FBI's coverage of King was also its coverage of the SCLC.

Court Seal [JFK Law 10(a)1]

In respect to that part of Item 5, wherein the SSC requested a list of all elsurs which "intercepted and/or monitored" any conversations of Martin luther King, Jr. at any time between January 1, 1960 and April 5, 1968, an extensive, exhaustive review has been made of Bureau files, including a review of the elsur indices, Martin Luther King's main file and other files directly and indirectly related to the Investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr., to satisfy this part of the request. As a result of this review, it was determined that Martin Luther King, Jr.

In addition, to further satisfy this part of the request, inquiries have been made of some field offices concerning this particular aspect. However, their extensive review has been unsuccessful. One reason for the unsuccessful attempts to retrieve this particular information both at FBIHQ and in the field can be attributed to the fact that FBI elsur indices did not come into existence until October 5, 1966, and did not become operational for a period of time following October 5, 1966.

In respect to Item 6 (d) which requested data concerning FBI dissemination of information concerning King, we are not supplying this data pursuant to an agreement between Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the SSC Staff and Special Agent Elmer Larson of the FBI.

extensive research of Martin Luther King's "June" file, his main
file and the "June" files of the Communist Influence in Racial
Matters (CIRE), the Communist Party, United States of America

review of aforementioned files. These files and the elsur
indices were reviewed by Special Agents George R. Roes and

of the 3/14/75 letter, an agreement was reached between SSC
Staff Member Mark Gitenstein and Supervisor Elner Larson of the
Senstudy 75 Project that a response to Item 6 (d) is not neces-

MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE

155-26
CONFIDENTIAL

The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled *Irvine v. California*, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveillances by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisal of the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters relating to the internal security of the country.

It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities of espionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons. In such instances I am of the opinion that the national interest requires that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This use need not be limited to the development of evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in connection with internal security matters equally as important as the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions. The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance by the FBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.

I do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court in *Irvine v. California, supra*, requires a different course. That case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investigations. It is quite clear that in the *Irvine* case the Justices of the Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of installing a microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the installation of a microphone in a bedroom or in some comparably intimate location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however, that important intelligence or evidence relating to matters connected with the national security can only be obtained by the installation of a microphone in such a location. It is my opinion that under such circumstances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the Supreme Court's decision in the *Irvine* case.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 216

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones, suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realid that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection --with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected. It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation which will permit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner most conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI. to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of internal security and the national safety are paramount and, therefore, may compel the unrestricted use of this technique in the national interest.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

With reference to the proper controls over wiretapping and the installation of microphones, you will recall that I advised you that back under the administration of Attorney General Clark I recommended that all Government agencies refrain from wiretapping unless there was specific approval in each instance by the Attorney General who is the chief law officer of the Government. I repeated the same recommendation to each successive Attorney General following the administration of Attorney General Clark.

I have always felt that there was a very lax control in the handling of wiretapping by Government agencies. I am the only head of a Government investigative agency who does not have the authority to authorize a wiretap, but under the system which I personally set up. Therefore, requests for wiretaps are sent by me to the Attorney General for his approval or disapproval. I know that no such system is followed in other branches of the Government and, in fact, in many instances subordinates quite far down the line of authority tap telephones without the specific approval of the head of the agency and certainly without specific approval of the cabinet officer in charge of the department.

I still feel quite strongly that no Government agency should tap a telephone unless it is specifically approved in each instance by the Attorney General. This would certainly circumscribe promiscuous wiretapping on the part of Government agencies and would centralize in one place, the Attorney General's office, a record of any phone taps which have been placed by a Government agency.

As you are aware, in the case of the FBI we do not request phone taps except in cases involving kidnaping and espionage. This has been predicated upon my theory that when the life of an individual or the life of the Nation is in peril a phone tap is justified for intelligence purposes as any information obtained over a phone tap cannot be used in the trial of a criminal case.

MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE

![ALL ITEM INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN UNCLASSIFIED DATE10/1/60 BY Osplay]

155-26

The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled *Irvine v. California*, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveillances by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisal of the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters relating to the internal security of the country.

It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities of espionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons. In such instances I am of the opinion that the national interest requires that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This use need not be limited to the development of evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in connection with internal security matters equally as important as the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions. The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance by the FBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.

I do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court in *Irvine v. California*, requires a different course. That case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investigations. It is quite clear that in the *Irvine* case the Justices of the Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of installing a microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the installation of a microphone in a bedroom or in some comparably intimate location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however, that important intelligence or evidence relating to matters connected with the national security can only be obtained by the installation of a microphone in such a location. It is my opinion that under such circumstances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the Supreme Court's decision in the *Irvine* case.

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones, suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realized that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected. It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation which will permit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner most conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of internal security and the national safety are paramount and, therefore, may compel the unrestricted use of this technique in the national interest.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

With reference to the proper controls over wiretapping and the installation of microphones, you will recall that I advised you that back under the administration of Attorney General Clark I recommended that all Government agencies refrain from wiretapping unless there was specific approval in each instance by the Attorney General who is the chief law officer of the Government. I repeated the same recommendation to each successive Attorney General following the administration of Attorney General Clark.

I have always felt that there was a very lax control in the handling of wiretapping by Government agencies. I am the only head of a Government investigative agency who does not have the authority to authorize a wiretap, but under the system which I personally set un. Therefore, requests for wiretaps are sent by me to the Attorney General for his approval or disapproval. I know that no such system is followed in other branches of the Government and, in fact, in many instances subordinates quite far down the line of authority tap tele- phones without the specific approval of the head of the agency and certainly without specific approval of the cabinet officer in charge of the department.

I still feel quite strongly that no Government agency should tap a telephone unless it is specifically approved in each instance by the Attorney General. This would certainly circumscribe promiscuous wiretapping on the part of Government agencies and would centralize in one place, the Attorney General's office, a record of any phone taps which have been placed by a Government agency.

As you are aware, in the case of the FBI we do not request phone taps except in cases involving kidnaping and espionage. This has been predicated upon my theory that when the life of an individual or the life of the Nation is in peril a phone tap is justified for intelligence purposes as any information obtained over a phone tap cannot be used in the trial of a criminal case.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

RE: Senate Select Committee

(Senstudy) 1775

On the afternoon of August 19, 1975, John Ellif of the SSC staff, telephoned me to report that the Committee has decided to defer on its pending request for the identity of various so-called "recipient-source" witnesses in the COINTEL program.

Mr. Ellif also emphasized that he wished to apologize to the Attorney General for possibly misstating the grounds as to why the Committee and the staff had decided to reject the proposals apparently agreed upon by Senator Church and the Attorney General.

Finally, I noted to John Ellif that I continue to have difficulty in understanding why the staff insists that they need further witnesses to establish any possible "damage" to the targets of the COINTEL program. Ellif finally agreed that since they do know the names and identities of the targets, the latter probably would be the best witnesses on this issue in any event. Nonetheless, Ellif did stress that it is possible that later on in the fall, the Committee and its staff may choose to come back and press its demands for the right to interview the recipient-source witnesses.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE 10/12/02 BY SPO

On 9/10/75, SA Daniel A. Flynn of the New York
Office (NYO) was interviewed by a Staff Member of the U. S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) in
its offices in Washington, D. C., on the subject of mail
'openings. The interview was recorded by an SSC stenographer.

On the morning of 9/26/75, SAC Robert Denz, NYO,
telephonically contacted Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the
Senstudy 75 Project and advised that Flynn had been contacted
by James Dick, the SSC Staff Member who had interviewed him.
Dick informed Flynn that the transcript of the interview
is available for review by Flynn but that the review must
be done in SSC offices, pursuant to SSC rules. The deadline
for Flynn's review is 9/30/75. Also according to SSC rules,
Flynn's review will not permit any substantive changes but
only changes as to grammar, and the like. Flynn desires
the opportunity to review the transcript and authority was
sought for his coming to Washington, D. C., the morning of
9/30/75.

EX-106 REC-7

In addition to seeking authority for the trip
SAC Denz inquired as to the position Flynn should take in
the event he reviews the transcript and finds the recording
as inaccurate from a substantive standpoint. Phillips told
Denz that, before coming to Washington, D. C., Flynn ought
to review any notes he has, as well as the LHM which Flynn
prepared and submitted to the Bureau after the interview.
If Flynn finds that in his opinion the transcript is inaccurate
from a substantive standpoint, and he is unable to persuade
Dick to make any changes, Flynn should submit another LHM

On 9/11/75, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., was advised that Senator Howard Baker had reviewed the information contained in Bureau files pertaining to him per instructions of the Attorney General and in response to the letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee, dated May 27, 1975. Baker requested that one particular file be made available for review by his designee on the Senate Select Committee, James Madigan. This file is titled ALLEGED TAPPING OF TELEPHONE OF UNITED STATES SENATOR HOWARD BAKER, WASHINGTON, D. C. (Bufile 139-4744). Shaheen was asked what the Department position was concerning this particular request, inasmuch as the file had been made available to the Senator pursuant to the instructions of the Attorney General.

REC-7

Shaheen advised that inasmuch as the initial request was from the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee for access to files for Senators that any modification of that request giving access to Senate Select Committee Staff Members should also be pursuant to a communication from the Chairman of that Committee. Shaheen indicated that making the file available to Senator Baker's designee may set a precedent which could be used by other interested Senator on the Committee to gain access for their designees. Shaheen offered to telephonically advise John Elliff, Task Force Director for the Senate Select Committee, that the Department would not grant access to this particular file for Madigan. He was advised that the Bureau should perhaps respond to Senator Baker's request inasmuch as it was made to the Bureau and that unless he was advised to the contrary the Bureau would advise Senator Baker of this decision. Shaheen interposed no objection to this decision.

RECOMMENDATION:

That Senator Baker be advised that it was not possible to grant access to his designee, Madigan, to the above-described file.

By a prior oral arrangement between Mr. Mark Gitenstein, Staff Member, Senate Select Committee (SSC), and Mr. W. R. Wannall, Assistant Director, Intelligence Division (INTD), a briefing was scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on 8/28/75. This briefing was to consist of a discussion of the various indices maintained and operated by the FBI. Information pertaining to these indices had previously been submitted the SSC by letterhead memorandum dated July 17, 1975, and documents pertaining to the indices were made available for review by appropriately cleared SSC Staff Members at FBI Headquarters.

This briefing was held in the conference room of the INTD, JEH Building, on 8/28/75 during the approximate period 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Present at this meeting were Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Section Chief J. G. Deegan Unit Chief E. P. Grigalus, SA K. A. Mendenhall, all of the INTD, Mark Gitenstein, Michael Epstein, and Martha Talley, Staff Members of the SSC.

Main items of discussion during this briefing centered around the Rabble Rouser Index (RRI), later known as the Agitator Index (AI), the Key Activist Program (KAP), the Security Index (SI), and the Administrative Index (ADEX). The origin and implementation of the above-mentioned indices and the KAP were discussed and Mr. Wannall offered background information and historical reasoning as to the necessity for implementing these indices and the KAP. Mr. Deegan answered questions pertaining to the AI and Messis Grigalus and Mendenhall answered questions pertaining to the KAP, the SI, and ADEX, which were raised by the SSC Staff Members.

SSC Staff Members desired to know what plan of action was currently available for the FBI to apprehend individuals whose names are currently on the ADEX and they.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

were advised there is no plan of action in the FBI for the
apprehension of the individuals so listed. The SSC Staff
Members were advised individuals currently listed on the
ADEX would merely be afforded priority investigative attention
during any national emergency which should occur; however,
they would not be apprehended. SSC Staff Members also
indicated they felt criteria for inclusion on the ADEX
when first established were the same as the criteria for
inclusion on the old SI. They were advised when the ADEX
Program was initiated the criteria were basically the same;
however, after closely following the matter for a period
of approximately 8 months, the criteria were reevaluated
and revised so only individuals who were considered
currently dangerous were to be included on the ADEX.
SSC Staff Members were also advised that the SI was
stored "off-line" in the Bureau's computers and as such
was utilized in a strictly in-house operation. Informa-
tion was therefore not available to outside agencies or
terminals tied in with the Bureau's computer system.
Staff Members also indicated from a review of material
made available to them it appeared as though there was
friction between the Bureau and the Department during the
late 1940s and early 1950s with respect to establishing
guidelines and policy in connection with the SI and they
desired to know what the cause of this friction was. INTD
representatives present advised they were unaware of the
cause of any such friction.

Other questions similar to those above were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and were answered by INTD personnel
present. In addition the following nine questions were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and Mr. Wannall indicated answers
would be obtained and orally furnished:

1. Was there a memorandum which established the
   RRI and does it indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before the
   Civil Unrest Commission? (A memorandum dated 8/3/67, from
   C. D. Brennan to Mr. W. C. Sullivan indicates Mr. Hoover
   instructed an index be compiled of racial agitators; however,
   the memorandum does not indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before
   the Civil Unrest Commission.)

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

2. Was there a memorandum concerning the
   expansion of the AI to include individuals of local
   prominence? (Memorandum of G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C.
   Sullivan dated 11/22/67 requested approval of an SAC
   letter for expanding the AI to include local leaders as
   well as national leaders involved in racial disorders.)

3. Were individuals included on both the AI and
   the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?
   (Individuals were included on both the AI and the SI;
   however, this was not necessarily a duplication of effort
   inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized in the apprehension
   and detention of individuals considered dangerous and the
   AI was an administrative aid to follow the activities and
   movement of individuals attempting to cause racial
   disorders.)

4. When did the SI become automated and was the
   Reserve Index (RI) ever automated? (The SI became automated
   during the early 1950s and was updated throughout the years
   with the advancement of computer technology and purchase
   by the Bureau of more advanced computers. Following
   discontinuance of the SI the ADEX was continued in the
   computer systems in an "off-line" manner. The RI-A -
   was placed on automatic data processing (ADP) equipment
   the same as the SI. RI-B was maintained at the field
   level only and was never placed in the ADP equipment.)

5. Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's
   portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)
   been returned? (One copy of the Attorney General's
   portfolio concerning the EDP has been located and is
   currently maintained in the Security Informant Unit of
   the IS-2 Section, INTD.)

6. Who were the Bureau individuals who
   (a) maintained the Attorney General's portfolio during
   1968 and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?
   (The following individuals were identified through
   review of pertinent communications during time period
   in question: (a) 1968 C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow,
   T. P. Rosack; (b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J. C. Strickland;
   1948-Lish Whitson, W. H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

Re: Senstudy 75

7. When did the Department start reviewing and approving the SI list? (Matters pertaining to the old Custodial Detention List were first referred to the Department during March, 1941. Copies of the SI were submitted to the Department during 1951 and the Department, on a continuing basis, reviewed matters pertaining to the SI except for brief periods of time when funds and manpower were not available until the SI was discontinued in 1971.)

8. Was there a form used by the Department concerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals on the SI and, if so, what does the form look like? (Forms were utilized and copies have been obtained to exhibit to SSC Staff Members.)

9. Do we have a copy of the form for including or deleting an individual from the AI? (FD-397 was utilized with the AI. A copy of this form will be exhibited to SSC Staff Members.)

At the closure of this briefing SSC Staff Members expressed their appreciation to the Bureau personnel present and indicated the briefing had furnished them a better understanding of the Bureau's utilization of the above indices and the ΚΑΡ.

ACTION:

With your approval and in accordance with your previous instructions the Senstudy Unit will initiate contact with Mr. Gitenstein so answers relating to the above nine questions may be orally provided to the above-named SSC Staff Members.

On 8/21/75, Michael Epstein, Staff Member, Senate
Select Committee, requested that SA Jay Robert Newton of the
New York Office be made available for interview concerning the
FBI's investigations of the Women's Liberation Movement and
other women's groups and organizations. Epstein stated that
this would be a Staff interview. According to Epstein, SA
Newton is assigned to the New York Office and he requested
that he be advised when Newton would be available for inter-
view.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That SA Newton be released from existing
employment agreement for the purpose of an interview by the
Senate Select Committee in compliance with their request:

(2) That the Intelligence Division arrange for an
Agent to be available for consultation but not present during
the interview of SA Newton.

(3) Verify that SA Newton is assigned to the New
York Office and if not, determine his current office of assign-
ment so that final arrangements, concerning interview may be
made with the Senate Select Committee.

On 8/22/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director for the Domestic Intelligence Task Force of the Senate Select Committee, advised that regarding proposed plans for testimony by Bureau officials before the Senate Select Committee that the Committee tentatively scheduled hearings for mid-October. He cited October 16th as being the approximate date. Initially, according to Elliff, hearings concerning the Bureau were to have been initiated in the first week of October but the Staff Members did not have the necessary background information to conduct the hearings at that time and instead scheduled hearings concerning IRS for early October.

Elliff indicated that the tentative format for these hearings would be to furnish the Bureau an outline of or a series of questions pertaining to the area to be covered in testimony prior to our appearance. He indicated that the hearings would cover a narrow topic on any given day so that a Bureau official could be briefed and respond to questions raised concerning the particular subject matter.

Elliff indicated that typical subjects of hearings concerning the FBI would be a one-day hearing on political abuse or a series of hearings on COINTELPRO.

Elliff indicated that it was the Committee's intent to continue hearings regarding the FBI into mid-December once they are initiated with the Bureau testifying at least once a week during that period. He advised they also envisioned the initial hearing as setting forth what the scope of the Senate Select Committee inquiry had been into the FBI and of topics to be covered by hearings. Elliff felt this would inform the House Select Committee of what areas the Senate Select Committee had delved into.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

On 8/25/75, SA Daly determined from Michael
Epstein of the Senate Select Committee that this
particular interview was not considered an "abuse"
interview and if the Bureau so desired, they could have
a representative present during the interview. Accord-
ingly, Recommendation #2 in this memorandum should be
changed to show that an Agent may, in fact, be present.

It is the Committee's intention to insert in some of the blanks in the documents an identifying description of IRS personnel who assisted the FBI in' certain instances, such as "an IRS Special Agent" or "an IRS Inspector". We will make these identifications based upon our notes from the documents, and will supply you with copies of the documents in which such descriptions have been typed in order that you may check the accuracy of the descriptions. In this way, we will avoid public identification of the IRS personnel even though Bureau agreement has previously been obtained that these individuals are not "sources".

IN THE SEPTEMBER 17, 1975, MESSAGE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THAT "AARON AND TRUEHART ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE. STAFF MEMBERS AND THAT IT IS BELIEVED THAT RECIPIENTS COULD BE FORTHCOMING IN RESPONDING TO THEIR INQUIRIES." THE SEPTEMBER 17, 1975, MESSAGE INSTRUCTED, HOWEVER, THAT OPERATIONAL DETAILS, SOURCES AND METHODS WERE NOT CONSTRUED TO BE LEGITIMATE AVENUES OF INQUIRY.. THE SEPTEMBER 17, 1975, MESSAGE NOTED THAT BOTH. AARON. AND TRUEHART. HAD BEEN BRIEFED BY STATE DEPARTMENT AND CIA OFFICIALS FOR THEIR VISIT. [^2]

Reference is made to the request of the SSC dated August 26, 1975, for FBI materials. Included in this request, Part I, Number 6a through r, was a request for extensive material relating to the discontinued Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros) of this Bureau. Except as noted below, this material is being delivered with this memorandum.

Items 6b, c and d, of the above request relate to documents included in the FBI Cointelpro which targeted Soviet-Satellite intelligence. Because of the sensitivity of these documents and their foreign intelligence ramifications, they are not being delivered at this time; however, they are available for review by members of your staff in Room 4171, JEH Building.

Item 6f refers to an August 25, 1967, letter "described in Item e above," which sets up requirements for status letters to be periodically submitted and requests all such status letters. No letter of this date is described in Item e. A review of FBI files indicates the August 25, 1967, letter is captioned "Counterintelligence Program, Black Nationalist; - Hate Groups, Internal Security." Copies of a memorandum dated February 29, 1968, and an airtel dated March 4, 1968, which set up the requirements for status letters in this Program, are included in material forwarded under Item 6a. Under this item it is also requested all status letters submitted in accordance with instructions in the August 25, 1967, letter be submitted. The status letters submitted under the "Counterintelligence Program, Black Nationalist - Hate Groups" Program are being furnished under Item 6j which requests all progress letters under that Program.

Enclosed is a list of documents which the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities may decide to declassify
for its public hearings on the Huston Plan. We invite your
opinion on any sections which you think ought to be sanitized
before declassification. Of course, the great majority of
key documents on the Huston Plan are already a matter of public
record.

Since these hearings may be held as early as September 23rd
and certainly by early October, your quick response would be
most helpful.

Sincerely,

I would appreciate an early meeting with you and other appropriate Bureau representatives to discuss a proposed resolution of the matters raised by the attached requests.

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Esq.
Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination
Office of the Deputy Attorney General
U. S. Department of Justice
Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mike:

The following two documents, which relate to the Martin Luther King, Jr. matter, are the subject of a pending Committee request for documents:

A. Airtel dated 2/12/62 from SAC, New York, to Director, FBI, subject "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., SM-C (00:Atlanta); "and

B. Airtel dated 8/15/66 from SAC, New York, to Director, FBI, subject "Communist Party, USA, Counterintelligence Program, Internal Security - C (Stanley David Levison)."

These two documents had been previously provided to the Committee in heavily or almost completely excised form. Virtually the entire contents of Item A. (a 3-page airtel) were excised because "it could result in identification of an FBI informant," and more than 12 pages of Item B. (a 29-page airtel) were excised because such portions contained information which "tends to identify highly sensitive sources of continuing value." A third document which is needed by the Committee, and which would presumably also be provided by the Bureau only in excised form is a New York field office letter to the Bureau dated 6/21/62 as cited in the last paragraph of page 9 of the 10/11/62 memorandum from the SAC, Atlanta, to the Brester, FBI, subject "Communist Infiltration of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, IS-C (00: Atlanta)."

Page 2                                                         September 16, 1975

The Bureau's position with respect to the excised portions
of Items A. and B. above was reiterated by FBI representatives
at our September 9 meeting, notwithstanding our position that
these materials were deemed to be absolutely essential to our
complete understanding of the King investigation. As you are
aware, several other documents previously provided to the
Committee contain conclusionary statements about Stanley Levison
as predicates for many of the actions taken with respect to
King, and it would appear that the withheld portions of
Items A. and B. above, as well as the 6/21/62 New York letter
described above, would contain the detailed bases for such
conclusions.

I am sure you would agree that the underlying facts
concerning Levison are vital in order that we can meet our
responsibilities to fully assess the propriety of the FBI's
activities with respect to this case. Accordingly, I would
appreciate your personal attention to this matter, including
your own examination of the three documents in question, and
hopefully, a determination by you that these documents should
be provided to the Committee in unexcised form (except for the
names of so-called "live" informants).

An early resolution of this matter is essential, and I
would hope you can respond by the end of the week.

Sincerely,

TRANSFERS HE HAS AT THE PRESENT TIME NO RECOLLECTION WITHOUT
BENEFIT OF THE FILE AND WOULD CERTAINLY NOT WISH
REFRESH HIS RECOLLECTION THROUGH REVIEW OF PERTINENT FILES
FOR PURPOSE OF ANSWERING THE INQUIRY. IF, HOWEVER, THE
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE HAD PERTINENT
DOCUMENTS AUTHORED AND SIGNED OR INITIALED BY MOORE AND
UTILIZED THIS MATERIAL TO REFRESH MOORE'S RECOLLECTION, HE
WOULD, OF COURSE, COOPERATE FULLY. HE POINTED OUT HE
WOULD IN NO WAY BE UNCOOPERATIVE BUT SIMPLY HAS NO
INDEPENDENT RECOLLECTION AT THE PRESENT TIME.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

I have been contacted by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee and instructed by Mr. Paul Wallach to report for an interview on September 23, 1975 at 2:00 P.M.

I have learned that the "Hunter" matter, on which I'm to be interviewed, is presently under review for possible criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice. Accordingly, since, while being associated with "Hunter", I was under Bureau direction, I am requesting that an attorney be appointed for me by the Department of Justice or arrangements be effected that I can be reimbursed if I secure my own attorney.

Sincerely yours?

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams DATE: 9-17-75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE BY S

Senate Select Committee (SSC) convened public hearings 9-16-75, at which Chairman Frank Church announced the chief purpose of the inquiry was to examine the role of CIA disobeying direct orders of President Nixon who had ordered the destruction of biological/bacteriological agents and weapons of war by Presidential Order, 11-25-69. Chairman Church referred to previous executive testimony of Director Colby which established that CIA had maintained a supply of approximately 6 grams of shellfish toxin, a lethal agent, until June, 1975, in apparent contravention of the Presidential Order of 1969. The retention of the toxin had been ordered by a midlevel employee without the knowledge of former Director Richard Helms.

While Chairman Church stressed it is not the purpose of SSC to denigrate the importance of the FBI and the CIA of their contribution to the welfare of the United States, he stated subsequent SSC hearings would highlight the necessity that Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies operate in a manner which will not infringe upon the rights of American citizens.

Church added that SSC will eliminate the possibility of domestic abuse by these agencies and will draft legislation for the establishment of joint Congressional oversight.

Dr. Nathan Gordon, project NAOMI chemist who retired from CIA on 9-30-72, testified he had received no

Memorandum to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel
Re: SENSTUDY 75

CIA directive to destroy or impinge on his decision to maintain the toxins and, further, the Presidential Order was directed toward offensive biological weapons of war in possession of the Department of Defense. Additionally, Dr. Gordon pointed out that the shellfish toxin over which he had custody was a chemical substance and could not be classified as a biological weapon.

Former Director Helms will appear before SSC in public session, 9-17-75.

FROM: Michael E. Shaheen, Jr.

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Request for IRS Information

Reference is made to my memoranda of September 9, and September 11, 1975 (copies of which are attached), by which I forwarded to you copies of the September 4, 1975, letter from SSC Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General and the letter of "modification" dated September 10, 1975, from John Elliff to me.

I have been orally advised (and will be in receipt of a confirming letter today) that the very long list of names and organizations about whom tax information was and is sought by Schwarz's September 4, letter was intended to apply as well to the Bureau for its response.

The Bureau is, therefore, requested to provide relevant materials and documents pertaining to Bureau requests for tax returns and tax return information, on the individuals and organizations listed in Mr. Schwarz's letter of September 4. In other words, the request made in the September 4, letter is for Bureau response except as Elliff's letter of modification exempts the raw files of the Bureau from inclusion in this request.

The SSC staff requests that materials be assembled on the named individuals and organizations in the same order as they are listed in the letter and that when a response for a given name or organization involves great volume of materials or documents, an appropriate Bureau official should advise either.

3 ENCLOSURE


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 380

Mark Gitenstein or Art Harrigan of the SSC staff that response, in such an instance, will be voluminous and should be refined by consultation.

I am advised, as usual, that because the SSC anticipates early hearings on the materials specifically sought by this request, this request enjoys urgent priority. Please prepare as prompt a response as possible.

(I am attaching the letter confirming the oral advise that the September 4, letter applies to the Bureau; that letter was received while this memo was in typing.)

Dear Mike:

As Mark and you discussed today on the phone, it was the Committee's intent in Fritz Schwarz' letter to you of September 4, 1975, that the FBI, as well as the Internal Security Division, provide information pertaining to the individuals and organizations listed in that letter. Of course this letter and the August 29 letter are modified by my letter of September 10. Furthermore, this request is of the highest priority and therefore we want to be kept informed of its progress on a daily basis. Perhaps the best approach would be to have Bureau representatives contact either Mark Gitenstein or Art Harrigan immediately so that we might prioritize the names listed in the September 4 letter.

Sincerely yours,.

SUBJECT: Modification of SSC Request

Attached is a letter from John Elliff of the SSC staff which modifies the language of the August 29, letter from the SSC's Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General. The last sentence of the first paragraph of the August 29, letter read as follows:

"Where an Internal Security Division request was made with respect to a person or organization on whom the Internal Security Division or the FBI maintained or maintains a file, we would appreciate the opportunity to review the entire file". (emphasis mine)

The modification of the first paragraph effected by the attached letter deletes the words "or the FBI" as underlined above: Such a modification exempts the raw files of the Eureau from inclusion in this request. The request still requires response by the Bureau for "all documents" in its possession as requested of the entire Department generally by the modified first paragraph.

Reference is made to my memorandum of September 5, 1975, by which I forwarded to you for your attention and appropriate response a letter dated August 29, 1975, from the Senate Select Committee which contained a "partial list" of selected cases in which IRS files indicated that the Department had received tax returns and other tax information. You will recall that that letter requested that the Department expedite the production of its files showing the origin of each request, the use made of the information, and the names of Departmental personnel with firsthand knowledge of the request for and use of the tax information in each instance of such request.

Attached for your further attention and additional response is what is hoped to be the Committee's completed list of selected cases for which the SSC seeks the same information as requested in their letter of August 29.

Please advise me as soon as possible of any delays that may make prompt compliance with this request impossible.

David Bushong, who identified himself as a Senate

9/10/75 that the Bureau determine the listing for telephone
number 714-756-3388 in Rancho, Santa Fe, California, and the
listing for Post Office Box 515 in Rancho, Santa Fe, California.
Bushong indicated that the fact he was attached to the Senate
Select Committee could be verified by inquiry with Staff Director
Bill Miller or Security Officer Ben Marshall of that Committee.

Mark Gitenstein of the Senate Select Committee was
telephonically contacted by SA Paul V. Daly and advised of the
request received from David Bushong. He was informed that the
Bureau did not have authority to conduct an investigation for
the Senate Select Committee in the absence of instructions from
the Attorney General and that the Bureau would not conduct such
an investigation in the absence of same. Gitenstein agreed that
the Bureau should not conduct the investigation and indicated he
would bring this to the attention of Bushong.

Subsequently, ASAC Arthur Barger of the San Diego
Office telephonically advised he had been contacted by David
Bushong and asked to make available to him information he had
requested the Bureau to furnish. Barger was informed that the
Committee had been notified that this was an improper request
and that the Bureau was not going to comply. He was told to
tell Bushong that Mark Gitenstein of the Committee had been
apprised of this matter and he should contact Gitenstein.

Gitenstein was telephonically recontacted and advised
that Bushong had contacted the San Diego Office requesting an
investigation and Gitenstein was reminded that he had stated
previously he would insure that Bushong was advised that his
was an improper request. Gitenstein explained that he did not
realize Bushong had left for San Diego and that he would straighten the situation out.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Subsequently, Gitenstein telephonically recontacted SA Paul V. Daly and advised that the request for investigation had been done "behind his and Elliff's back" apparently referring to John Elliff, Task Force Director for the Senate Select Committee. He indicated that this request had been discussed with the Deputy Attorney General's Office and was an investigation being conducted by Senate Tower and Kurt Smothers, Minority Counsel. He requested that SA Daly contact Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the Department, to verify that arrangements have been made for the Bureau to conduct this investigation.

SA Daly contacted Shaheen and Shaheen advised that he knew nothing of this request. Shaheen was informed that absent specific instructions from the Attorney General the Bureau would not conduct the requested investigation and Shaheen agreed that this was the proper position for the Bureau. Shaheen was informed that the Senate Select Committee Staff Member conducting the investigation was David Bushong and Shaheen stated that he knew Bushong and Bushong had formerly been the Administrative Assistant to former Attorney General William Saxbe.

Subsequently, John Bayley, Assistant Minority Counsel for the Senate Select Committee, telephonically contacted SA Daly and apologized for the request that the Bureau conduct an investigation for the Senate Select Committee and he indicated that he thought arrangements had been made for this investigation through the Deputy Attorney General's Office. Bushong advised that Senator Tower was currently attempting to locate the Attorney General to straighten out this particular problem and apparently arrange for the Bureau to conduct such an investigation.

Reference is made to my memorandum of September 5, 1975, by which I forwarded to you for your attention and appropriate response a letter dated August 29, 1975, from the Senate Select Committee which contained a "partial list" of selected cases in which IRS files indicated that the Department had received tax returns and other tax information. You will recall that that letter requested that the Department expedite the production of its files showing the origin of each request, the use made of the information, and the names of Departmental personnel with firsthand knowledge of the request for and use of the tax information in each instance of such request.

Attached for your further attention and additional response is what is hoped to be the Committee's completed list of selected cases for which the SSC seeks the same information as requested in their letter of August 29.

Please advise me as soon as possible of any delays that may make prompt compliance with this request impossible.

2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

29 August 1962

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Summary of S/W Training and Issuance of Materials.
AGENT : AMLASH/1
PLACE : Paris, France
DATE : 17-22 August 1962
TRAINER: Richard M. Fallucci, TPE C/O.

1. AMLASH/1 was instructed in S/W techniques by the under-
   signed in a Paris Station safehouse on 17 and 18 August, and was
   given an S/d review in the final briefing session held in the hotel
   room of Wallace A. Growery (Madrid Station C/O) on 22 August.
   Instruction was given in the use of carbon writing system No. 15136
   and in the use of liquid developer system No.56638. The "scorch"
   method of development was also demonstrated to A/l as an alternate
   system. A total of five hours was devoted to this instruction.

2. A/1, who was recruited a short time prior to coming to
   Paris, was introduced to the idea of using S/W by the undersigned
   during discussions held in Copenhagen. Although for security
   considerations, he was skeptical at first about using such a means
   of communication, he was without undue effort convinced that any
   productive relationship depended upon his being able to communicate
   with his C/O on a regular basis through the medium of S/N letters
   sent through normal mail channels. It was apparent from his early
   questions that he was unfamiliar with the principles of S/d and clandes-
   tine communications in general. After further talks in Paris with
   Growery on 16 Angust, A/1 was fully prepared to accept the concept
   of S/W communications, and arrangements were made for this instruction
   to begin the following day.

3. The first training session on 17 August lasted a little
   more than two hours, and was devoted to an explanation of the S/
   system of communication, including careful instruction in the
   preparation of a letter containing S/W. A/1 also prepared an S/
   letter of his own under the supervision of the undersigned. He
   seemed to grasp readily the principles of the preparation of an 5/

message and experienced only a little difficulty at first in remember-ing all the steps in sequence necessary for the preparation of an S/W message. He was generally attentive to the instruction given. However, in keeping with his temperment, he was a little impatient during the preparation of the S/W message itself upon the cover letter. At the end of this session, he demonstrated that he remembered the basic steps in a satisfactory manner, particularly considering that it was his first day in S/W instruction.

4. The second period of instruction took place in the same safehouse, lasting about two hours. This session was devoted to a review of the S/N procedures and the preparation by A/l of another practice S/W letter. Following this, A/1 was instructed in the development of S/W messages, using the liquid developer No. 56638 The scorch system of development was also demonstrated. A/1 was impressed by the simplicity of the liquid developer and the immediate reaction which it produced. The undersigned developed one message; then 4/1 was allowed to prepare the developer from its dry pill form and to develop a second practice S/W message for himself. Following the period devoted to S/W development, a general review of S/W communications was held, the basic points apparently being well-fixed in A/l's mind.

5. During the final formal meeting with A/1 on 22 August with Growery and the undersigned participating, the latter gave A/1 a general review of all the 3/6 procedures which were to be used in his contact with KUBARK. He also was provided with the following items:

A. Two sheets of S/W carbon paper (No. 15136)
B. Forty-seven pills of developer ( No. 56638)
C. One tablet of writing paper provided by TSD and known to be compatible with the carbon sheets.
D. 3 No. 2 pencils of French manufacture.
E. One ball-point pen with water-resistant ink.
F. Two accomodation addresses: one in Madrid for regular contact; one in New York City for rapid emergency contact (see attached S/W data sheet).
G. Appropriate indicators (see S/W data sheet)

It is noted that A/1 did not have a secure accomodation address in PBRUMEN to give us at this time. He was told, however, that it was imperative that he provide one for us by S/W letter within two weeks of his return to PERUMEN. This he stated he would do.

6. During the last S/W review, A/1 was shown a photograph of one of his practice messages which he had prepared. He was quite interested in seeing this, which served to illustrate a number of the training points which had been covered during previous instruction.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 3

Generally, A/1 was an interested pupil and it is believed that he will be able to carry out the instructions in a proper manner. He is quite security conscious, a factor which it is believed, will add to his attempts to seek perfection in his S/W correspondence and in the secure storage of his S/W materials when not in use. It is also known that A/1 practiced his S/W techniques in his hotel room after leaving the 22 August meeting. This is known because he had an additional question to ask us at a brief meeting on 23 August.

7. It should also be noted that the TSD technician who developed A/l's practice letters recommends that for best results, all letters from A/1 be subjected to ammonia fuming before immersion in the developer.

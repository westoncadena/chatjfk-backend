# DISPATCH

TO: CHIEF, C.

INFO: CUS/G, SR, FOB

FROM: CHIEF OF BASE, BUNN

SUBJECT: REDCAP LUIMPROVE AELADLE AELAULE LEAD

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

MICROFILMED

JUN 4 1963

DOC. MICRO. SER.

1. DURING A MEETING WITH [WEYDE] ON 21 MAY 63 HE REFERRED TO HIS VISIT TO WASHINGTON TO DEBRIEF AELADLE. HE STATED THAT CA ONE OCCASION, WHILE HE AND DR. NEIER WERE RIDING IN A CAR WITH AELALE AELADLE CASUALLY REFERRED BY NANE TO A KGB OFFICER PRESENTLY ASSIGNO IN GERMANY, COMMENTING THAT HE KNEW THE INDIVIDUAL VERY WELL AND KNEW THAT HIS POLITICAL VIEWS WERE THE SANE AS HIS OWN, BUT THAT WESTERN INTELLIGENCE SHOULD LEAVE THE INDIVIDUAL ALONE AS HE WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY MAKE THE SAME DECISION AS AELADLE ON HIS OWN.

2. BY THE TIME [WEYDE] REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT AELADLE WAS SAYING THE NAME HAD SLIPPED BY AND NEITHER HE NOR [DR. MEIER] WAS ABLE, OR FELT HE COULD, ASK FOR THE NAME AGAIN. AFTER LEAVING AELADLE BOTH [WEYDE AND MEIER] TRIED TO RECALL THE NAME OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUT COULD ONLY AGREE THAT THE NAME BEGAN WITH AN "A". IN REVIEWING THE PRESENT SOVIETS ASSIGNED IN THE GFR WHOSE NAMES BEGIN WITH A [WEYDE] TENDS TO THINK THE NAME MENTIONED MIGHT HAVE BEEN AKHLUYEV (20T-294346), ALTHOUGH HE IS FAR FROM CERTAIN ON THIS POINT.

3. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED INFORMATION IN OUR FILES UN AKHLOYB AND NUNE INDICATING KGB AFFILIATION. HE ARRIVED AT THE STM ON 16 FEBRUARY 61 ALONG WITH HIS WIFE, IS CARRIED BY THE [BFV] AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TRADE MISSION, AND RESIDES WITHIN THE TRADE MISSION BUILDING.

4. THE ABOVE LEAD, ALTHOUGH VERY SKETCHY, APPEARS DEFINITED WORTH PURSUING AND WE WONDER IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO QUERY AELADUE SOME MANNER. [WEYDE] HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT AELADLE DESIRED TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL FROM ANY INTELLIGENCE APPROACHES BASED ON HIS INFORMAT SO HE HAS PROBABLY NOT SUBMITTED ANY DETAILS. IT MAY, HOWEVER, PROE PROFITABLE TO REVIEW WITH AELADLE AGAIN SOME OF THE SOVIETS ASSIGNE IN WEST GERMANY AND WORK IN ALL THE 'A' NAMES. AELADLE NIGHT THUS GIVE SOME INFORMATION WHICH WOULD HELP US TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL HE MENTIONED IN THE CAR. PLS ADVISE IF THIS IS POSSIBLE.

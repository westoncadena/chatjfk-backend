JFK Project Officer

OFFICE:
OIM/HRP

SUBJECT:
ARRB Meeting 20 July - Results

REFERENCE:
The ARRB took the following actions on CIA document/issues:

1. Accepted CIA request to consider crypts/project names in Ford Presidential Library Documents (Rockefeller Commission) NBR, not believed relevant, protect until 2017;

2. Accepted CIA request to "retype" the *Australian* document being released in sanitized form (Board voted to protect the *liaison relationship* and to delete any identifying information at previous meeting);

3. Accepted CIA approved language for description of 4 pages dealing with the assassination from a *sensitive foreign* document know as the "Mark Lane" document. [Board member with permission of the foreign government had reviewed the full document on 7 July and agreed that the only the 4 pages should be included in the JFK collection.];

4. Rejected CIA request for reconsideration of previous decision to protect only the digraph of crypt, IJDECANTER [asset, dead, identity and relationship with Agency exposed in *Dec 1997 LA Times* article];

5. Rejected CIA request to deny in full JMWAVE org chart / Board voted 5-0 to "open in full".

The next Board meeting is 6 August. I need to as soon as possible if the Agency is going to appeal or ask for reconsideration re items 4 and 5.

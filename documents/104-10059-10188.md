MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT

[To be reliable]. It is Rocca's impression (it have worked This case thoroughly.) That The Soviets have contrived to try to make SHURAKOVA look clean i.e., that she has not had a KGB role and is only an Intourist interpreter to support N's thesis. This is questionable on its surface. At any rate The [controlled British] source and SHARAKOVA visited here Toussau's Way works museum where SHURAKOVA had a visibes reaction when seeing OSWALD display, alternida This Avisio was entirely innocent on the part of some source. [British] i.e., it was not done deliberately. SHURAKOVA's reaction indicated suspicion that This was a provocation.

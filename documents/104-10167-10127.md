# DISPATCH

TO
Chief, WH Division

FROM
KIMWI (KARINZY) (Isowes)

SUBJECT
Report of Contact with DER on 13 August 1959

ACTION REQUIRED
See Para 10.

REFERENCE
UMWA-11

1.  ODCHAR was asked first to bring me up to date on what he and the others in his group have been doing and he reported that they were not doing much of anything except waiting. Waiting, first, for some funds which they are expecting to come primarily from the sale of the D--6; and, second, waiting for the establishment of some better communication with their contacts in Cuba.

2.  With regard to the aircraft, ODCHAR told me on this date that he believes he does now have a sale for the aircraft and he thinks the sale price will be between US$50 and US$55 thousand.

3.  ODCHAR said that ODETE has communicated with someone (he wasn't sure of the name) in an attempt to solicit funds from people in Cuba. ODCHAR presented this in the light that ODCOVE was "authorizing" some people in Cuba to go ahead and solicit funds. In this connection, ODCHAR mentioned that at one time in the past Julio LOBO (note: this name has never been mentioned in any previous conversations with this group) had considered donating US$150 thousand for the air force school which ODCHAR was promoting at that time, but apparently became frightened of the deal and nothing along this line materialized. ODCHAR said that he was hopeful that sometime he would be able to re-establish contact with LOBO. All his reference is entirely coincidental to my suggestions made to LDBHOW that I might try to bring this group together with Julio LOBO. Having learned of this previous connection, I want to revive this idea and proceed with the plan to bring these two together.

4. If and when they are able to accumulate some funds, it is their intention to go ahead with their plans for the establishment of a propaganda program which would be initially voice radio. ODCHAR said that he had been trying to persuade ODEDBIAS and ODCOVE to a more narrow program within the limitations which I had cited for them in a previous meeting (See UMWA-11). He said he thinks now that this is the more realistic approach, ODCOVE holds to the original thinking that they cannot commit themselves to such limitations. ODCHAR informed me that ODCOVE requests another meeting with me. He was told that I would be away for a few days but would contact him as soon as I return.

5. I then questioned ODCHAR about his knowledge and ODBIAS' knowledge of the presence of Soviet Russians in Cuba. ODCHAR stated that his only information had come to him through Douglas ROOT (this is the Canadian whom ODCHAR referred to frequently in his earlier debriefing by SADELLY *et al.*). ROOT claimed to him to have seen the 05 Soviets in Santiago de Cuba and ODCHAR said that furthermore he had obtained the names which he passed to Colonel NICOLS in the American Embassy in Havana. When asked if he thought these were the same Soviets that ODBIAS had referred to in his testimony in Washington, ODCHAR said he felt that they were, although he believed ODBIAS' information was obtained independent of his, ODCHAR's, source.

6. Going on in this vein, ODCHAR stated that ROOT is one of several people whom ODCHAR encouraged to remain in place and to go along with Raul CASTRO and others for the purpose of obtaining more specific information on Communists and Communist activities in the armed forces. He said that along this line ROOT had been introduced to Fidel CASTRO's secretary, whose name is Maria. ODCHAR said her full name is a Russian name but at the moment he can only recall the name "Maria". Through this relationship, it was expected that ROOT will develop a good deal of information. Others named in this connection were Raul VALDES, who is close to Paul Castro, Juan FERNANDEZ de Castro of the Air Force, and Efran PICHARDO, whom ODCHAR says is an American. ODCHAR is certain that by some means can re-establish communication with these individuals he will obtain important information regarding Communist activities in the Cuban armed forces.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

7. In answer to his appeal for assistance, I still I would try to help him devise some means of establishing this communication. He suggested that we pass word to his wife to contact Juan FERNANDEZ de Castro before she leaves for the purpose of putting him in contact with envoys we want to name and try to instruct him in DOZAR's name to pass on any and all information he has at this time.

8. This group still believes, in spite of what has been reported from Cuba, that, while they may have some little different view as to how much MORGAN can be trusted, Eleoy GUTIERREZ Manoyo and MIRABAL and the men of the Second Front of the Escambray are and will remain anti-Castro and eventually will move against him.

9. It was learned that DOZAR is presently living in Frank FICRETT's house at 2030 SW 60th Court, Miami, telephone MO 7-9000. He also informed me that ODETTY had been talking with him about some local friends through whom he produced the names of some acquaintances of those whose names are Russian. I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss this with the ODENVY agent involved.

10. I will meet with the group again at the end of this week, at which time I expect they will have some modified position with regard to their activities and will appeal again for assistance. Meantime, it is recommended that DOZAR's recommendation with regard to having his wife get in touch with FERNANDEZ de Castro and to get him debriefed be passed to the Havana Station.

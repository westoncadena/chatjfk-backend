PROFESSIONAL

There's nothing outstanding about Tarasoff - just an average joe trying to make a living and without the ambition, energy, perspicacity to make use of a saleable article: knowledge of Russian. Physically he's sort of soft, tends to be overweight - he's about 5'8"tall, and about 190 in weight. His personality is on the negative side, his manner dull.

Tarasoff was greatly interested in the possibility of working for the US Government. He wants that security. And he has about reached the end of the line salary wise as a maintenance man or building superintendent. Tarasoff is willing to work in D.C. but insists on a GS 7 because he has to support a wife and two children. He does not mind the sedentary aspects of Project Detail - I doubt if he'd be interested in anything that wasn't sedentary. He also liked the other aspects of Detail and I would think, from talking with him that he would be quite able to handle a job on Detail. He can translate - reads with a great deal of ease. His PHS I notice indicates he's interested only in o/s - this is not what he told me; he is interested in US also but he will go o/s is necessary.

I recommend Tarasoff for a GS 7 on Project Detail.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action.

If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

This officer continues to perform his assigned duties in a superior fashion. Illness put him out of action for some time, but otherwise the Station received the fine performance which has come to be routine with him. This officer's experience and dedication make it possible for him to work effectively with an absolute minimum of supervision. He responds instinctively to items of operational significance, and his experience and knowledge make it possible for him to write penetrating analyses of target personalities, and interrelationships among these persons, based solely on what he hears.

This officer has also been called upon to transcribe material from audio operations, in addition to the telephone material which is his normal assignment. He has also handled this well, although his advancing age and less acute hearing make this task much more difficult for him.

While not called upon to use Spanish normally, he has sufficient fluency to handle material in Spanish when required.

This officer uses his time well and takes good care of the equipment assigned to him. He does not handle operational funds nor does he have any supervisory responsibilities.

Subject has not been in a supervisory position and his present assignment outside on unofficial cover working as a loner gives no indication as to his supervisory ability. It is believed Subject probably serves best as an independent analyst without supervisory responsibilities.

Subject has continued to demonstrate a very high level of interest and competence in his work. Beyond the relatively technical aspect of producing transcriptions, which he accomplishes with timeliness, accuracy and thoroughness, he strives to provide the Station and Headquarters with an insight in depth on the local Soviet complement. He does this capably, particularly when one understands the limitations of his technical access. His wife, a contract employee, assists him in the preparation of the technical product. However, her over-all contribution goes beyond this, since Subject and his wife work together in effort to distill the meaning of their product in terms of personality assessment. They are uniquely well adjusted to their deep cover circumstances, are of little burden administratively to the Station, and are presently interested in continuing their assignment in Mexico City indefinitely.

The relatively limited period of Subject's assignment to the Station, coupled with some novel complications attendant to a staffer's conversion to the DOP and to a deep cover status on a first assignment abroad, compels the supervisor to make a tentative assessment only at this time. However, from all indications to date it would appear that Subject and his family are acclimating themselves very well to the environmental, cover and work situation. Subject is interested in his work, applies himself conscientiously and is prompt in completing his assignments whether the work load for a day is light, or heavy and requires unpaid overtime concentration. The translation product is presently exact and conforms to the Station's standards for such work. As Subject becomes more familiar with specific Station requirements, through experience and with closer supervision than afforded to date, he will be able to make a more imaginative contribution to his work, an effort that he has already begun.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I agree with this rating. Mr. Tarasoff has common sense and intelligence sense. He appreciates the significance of information, for intelligence purposes, both in the fields for which he is responsible and in other fields as well.

His ability to scan rapidly a great volume of Russian-language material, and extract or note items of value, will be sorely missed.

Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

his native Russian language facility is of tremendous assistance to the section and the agency. is rapid scanning of seriat documents for his own
valuable bits of information on other subjects, which he is always careful to refer to the proper persons. He is always ready to assist with language problems and if he doesn't know the answer he exhausts all possible means to find what is called for or special branch or division projects involving reverse translation, and he has held a number of TDY assignments requiring spoken Russian. The morsels of intelligence gleaned for his own reports from the masses of material which he scans are briefly and tersely stated. Is a systematic worker, keeps good files, and avoids duplication. Plans and organizes his activities carefully so that he always manages to complete a project well ahead of the target date. has constant informal contact with all his consumers and goes to any length to give them what they want, provided that their request is reasonable and justifiable. If they ask for something which he knows is of no value or which has been duplicated elsewhere, he has no difficulty in persuading them to cancel the requirement, since they have learned that they can trust his work and his genuine desire to help. It is not hard to discern that he sometimes gets bored with the monotony of his work, but an occasional tour of TDY is generally sufficient to revive his enthusiasm for another year at his desk. Was an uneven temperament, sometimes gloomy and sometimes bantering, but only rarely does this affect his working relationships.

SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to improve his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for greater responsibilities. Amelity of explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, und D to provide the west basis of future personnel actions. Shows skill and good judent in extracting data on a wide range of technical subjects from Soviet documents, which he scans with great apicity, His written reports based on this material present good intelligence information however, they suffer slightly from small inaccuracies in syntax and grammar, and there are occasional passages where the meaning is vague or the logical connection between facts has not been made clear. This type of passage may be further complicated by his lack of native familiarity with the precise English idiom and his tendency sometimes to use the wrong connective. However, any such failings in the use of English are entirely offset by his superior knowledge of Russian. His promptness in submitting reports and in completing other assigments is exceptional. Maintains close relations with consumers and goes out of his way to fill all their requirements to the letter. His greatest assot to the section, branch, and division is his native Russian fluency and his knowledge of the USSR. He not only serves as consultant and authority on XX the Russian language for the section and branch, but takes on extra jobs as translator or interpreter as required by the division or the agency. His natural intelligence has enabled him to do on-the-spot or rush jobs in fields in which he has had no background. He continues to learn and to retain his knowledge. During a period when his well-deserved promotion was blocked because of thelack of a slot, a situation which was unfortunate but the fault of no one in his office, he became a bit rebellious and reluctant to take on extra duties which he otherwise would have accepted. He feels, and rightly so, that he is capable of more challenging and perhaps more interesting assignments which require the use of spoken Russian Every opportunity has been given him to find such a permanent assignment, and he has just been on extended TDY involving such activities.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

**DIRECTIONS:** Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job. Works hard. Reads Russian rapidly and looks out for material of interest to others as he scans. Is adaptable and flexible and handles several different technical fields with equal facility. Can tackle almost any subject without previous experience and turn out a good job. His native knowledge of Russian is of considerable benefit to the whole section. Selects the salient points from masses of useless or repetitive material with intelligent judgment, and compiles reports which are pointed and concise. His only deficiency of any consequence is the slight awkwardness and occasional lack of clarity in his written English style. His English has improved considerably during the past two years, but sometimes the failure to use the most precise term or the right connective complicates for the reader a conception which is perfectly clear to the writer.

SECTION D. SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

**DIRECTIONS:** Take into account here everything you knor about the individual....productivity, conduct in the job. pertinent personal characteristics or habits, special defects or talente....and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

3. INDICATE THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF MONTHS THE RATED EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN UNDER YOUR SUPERVISION

4. COMMENTS CONCERNING POTENTIAL

Because of his innate capacity I would judge that after initial adjustments, and with application, he will always be able to meet the requirements of the situation. His day to day activities will not always give evidence of this versatility, and it may sometimes come as a surprise.

He is now getting teaching experience by teaching one class in Basic Russian and another in Russian Conversation.

2. NOTE OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN INDIVIDUAL'S FUTURE ASSIGNMENTS

Because of his age, he would like to have a tour of overseas service within the next two or three years, before he settles down here to a permanent assignment.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on job. I feel that Mr. T. has not yet been on the job long enough to demonstrate his maximum capacities. Although he came with no background in his specialized field, he has shown considerable facility in acquiring technical information and building up his technical vocabulary. He has a good eye for intelligence. Although he has not native English fluency, his reports are pointed, concise, and, except for occasional minor points of grammar, very well expressed indeed. Owing to his persistence and application, he was rated second highest in a class in English usage, Soon after his EOD, the analyst whom Mr. T. was assisting was transferred, leaving him with full responsibility for covering a field which was still very new to him. He has done an exceedingly good job under the most unpropitious circumstances. He needs to develop fuller utilization of varied research methods, but this will be easier as he becomes more familiar with the materials and problems with which he has to deal. His native Russian fluency is a decided asset. He is calm, cooperative, and easy to work with.

SECTION D.

SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

DIRECTIONS: Take into account here everything you know about the individual....productivity, conduct in the job, pertinent personal characteristics or habite, special defecte or talents....and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

1. DEFINITELY UNSUITABLE - HE SHOULD BE SEPARATED
2. OF DOUBTFUL SUITABILITY... WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED HIM IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW
3. A BARELY ACCEPTABLE EMPLOYEE...BELOW AVERAGE BUT WITH NO WEAKNESSES SUFFICIENTLY OUTSTANDING TO WAR- RANT HIS SEPARATION
4. OF THE SAME SUITABILITY AS MOST PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE ORGANIZATION
5. A FINE EMPLOYEE HAS SOME OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS
   RATING 6. AN UNUSUALLY STRONG PERSON IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION
   NUMBER 7. EXCELLED BY ONLY A FEW IN SUITABILITY FOR WORK IN THE ORGANIZATION

IS THIS INDIVIDUAL BETTER SUITED FOR WORK IN SOME OTHER POSITION IN THE ORGANIZATION? [X] YES [] NO. IF YES. EXPLAIN FULLY

His native Russian fluency might be better utilized in some other type of position, although his performance on his present job is entirely satisfactory.

SECTION H. FUTURE PLANS
1. TRAINING OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL EXPERIENCE PLANNED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

Since Mr. T. Ahas been on duty such a short time, present plans are simply
to give him further training in his present job and to allow him to develop to
his maximum capacity there. He will soon be enrolled in the I.O.C.

2. NOTE OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN INDIVIDUAL'S FUTURE ASSIGNMENTS

His native Russian fluency should be taken into account.

REVIEWING OFFICIAL'S COMMENTS: I do not think he so nearly average in all respects as indicated in Sec. I, below. I do not know him well enough to disagree with most of the ratings, but I would rate him "4" on items 7, 15 and 29, at least. Quiet, unobtrusive, modest, cooperative. Have seen few indications off initiative, but such not to be expected while he is learning a new job; no reason to assume incapable of initiative. T.Bielefeldt

1956-1959: I worked for various establishments in Washington, D.C., as a translator from Russian into English, such as the Library of Congress, and various other translating firms, which abound in Washington, with a salary varying in accordance with the output of translated material, from $500.00 to 1,000.00 per month.

I was employed by USJPRS.

1959-1963: I joined USJPRS on Western Avenue in Washington D.C., which is a company under contract to the Dept. of State, the Dept. of Defense and on occasion to the Dept. of the Interior (fish hatcheries division). I worked as an analyst and translator, at home most of the time, translating and analysing articles from newspapers and technical magazines. I was paid $8.00 for 1,000 words for ordinary material, $12.00 for technical and $12.00 for scientific subjects. Also, I was hired by the Dept. of State to be an interpreter for two Soviet delegations at $25.00 per diem plus expenses. I spent five weeks with each of them.

1963-1970: After leaving USJPRS I came to Mexico with my wife and children to avoid the weather extremes of the USA and to look into possibilities of profitable investments that could aid me financially after my retirement. My income during this period came from annuities and the moneys lent to my brother-in-law in Cleveland, Ohio, who is a successful real estate man and the owner of an amusement machines business (Cadillac Music Co.) in which I had invested some money previously. I was also connected by mail with a linguistics studies firm, Room 212, 419 Boyleston Str, Boston 16, Mass. Frequently some of my friends from USJPRS would send me some special articles for translation. I would change the above organizations in accordance with the time spent in translating. This amounted to roughly $10,000.00 a year.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Tarasiti. Birs D.

SUBJECT : Retirement Planning

1. The established policy of the Agency favors early retirement of its employees who, as you know, are normally expected to retire when they become eligible for a full annuity. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought and planning, and you should therefore know that you will be eligible for retirement, according to our records, during November, 1970.

2. Planning ahead can bring about, with each passing year, definite progress toward your retirement goals. The Agency is anxious to assist you in planning for your retirement. It is even more important, as an employee, that you begin now to plan for this occasion.

3. You deserve to know as much as possible about the general subject of retirement and more specifically about the retirement policy itself, your annuity, life and health insurance protection, opportunities for other employment, Social Security benefits, and educational materials available on the subject. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory service should be made available to you at least five years prior to the date of your eligibility.

4. You are requested to call the Executive Secretary of the Board, Mr. Howard G. Phillips, on extension 6872 to arrange an appropriate time to discuss any plans you may have and benefits available to you upon retirement.

Amid widespread speculation about Orianas Bosch's involvement in both the Septemter 21 car-bomb slaying in Washington of former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and ine Ociccer 6 crash of a Cuban airline jet mat claimed the lives of all 73 persons aboard. Venezuelan authorities suddenly announced the arrest of the 9-year-vid Miami pediatrician and old CIA hand on October 14. Since then, the veil of Intrigue around Bosch has begun lifting, treatening to implicate the CIA, FBI, Miami-based Cuban exiles and high-anking officials oi Venezuela ard Chile.

It all began when Caracas police rounded up 14 anti-Castro Cubane-inclucing Sosch and Venezuela's own former security chief--And accused them ni Involvin, a terrorist ring: responsible for the Letelier assassination and the Cuban plane sahorage Further attacks in the U.. and six Latin nations were said to have been planted.

ΟΣΙΟΣ XIMISTER PACIO CHARIPIES COUP REPORT

San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GMT 7 Jul 76 PA

[Text] Referring to the news conference he held yesterday in connection with the alleged plotting of a coup d'etat in Quatemala, Foreign Affairs Minister Gonzalo Pacio said that his statements were distorted by certain international news agencies.

Pacio said that the Guatemalan Government was not involved and had no part in the plot. He added that the coup was under preparation and this was why he and the security minister had gone to Quatymala to investigate the armed movement apparently headed by Cuban Orlando Bosch.

Pacio said the coup was not imminent but that it was suspected in view of Bosch's trips to Quatemala.

Congressmen Concerned Over Rumors

San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 OMT 7 Jul 76 PA

[Text] A motion was submitted today at the Legislative Assembly to summon Public Security Minister Mario Charpentier Gamboa and Foreign Affairs Minister Gonzalo Facio to explain in full detail at a plenary session what is really happening in Guatemala. Furthermore, we see some connections in the plot, which is now a chronic occurrence originating in Quatemala and El Salvador, against our country's institutional stability with the CIA'S collaboration. Precisely this week the Public Security Ministry ordered James Williamson to leave the country. As we all know, Williamson is the CIA's chief in Costa Rica. During Figueres' administration he was declared persona non grata for publicly bragging about the activities of the CIA, the Costa Rica Libre Movement and other groups trying to over- throw the government in power at the time.

We expect Charpentier and Facio to explain to the deputies and the nation what is really happening in Quatemala and what role the CIA is playing in the plot to overthrow our democratic institutions and to place Costa Rica under a fascist dictatorship similar to those which exist in the continent's southern cone.

ODUBER STRESSES COUNTRY'S FREEDOM OF PRESS

Paris AFP in Spanish 0240 GMT 7 Jul 76 PA

[Text] San Jose, Costa Rica, 6 Jul--President Daniel Oduber today reiterated that there is unlimited freedom of press in Costa Rica. He was speaking on a nationwide radio and television network in connection with the forthcoming UNESCO conference on mass communications media, Which will open in San Jose on Monday.

He said that Costa Rica is willing to allow the holding there of a discussion reflecting all the various trends of thought regarding freedom of information. "We want the delegates to make an on-the-spot evaluation of the system of freedoms--including freedom of speech-- existing in Costa Rica," Oduber emphasised.

Oduber contended that he is against state control of publicity agencies and the communications media, although, he said, a certain amount of coordination between the government and those agencies is necessary.

(Excerpts) Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Gonzalo Facio told neussen daring a nuts conference tended that he spent the weekend in Guatemala with Costa Rican Publie Security Kinister Hario Charpentier Ganboa talking with Guatemalan Government officials about a coup that was supposed to take place in the next few days in Quatemala to overthrow President Kjell Laugerud Garcia,

Pacio said that Orlando Bosch and other persons were presumably involved in it but that the nanes of the others would not be inmediately revealed. The Guatemalan Government has the situation under control and the plan has failed.

Jacio said: [recording] (And since we also know) that Orlando Bosch had entered and left Quatemala several times using different passports he has (words indistinct). He came and went from here. We felt that it would be advisable to make a fast trip to cistemals to take a close look at things and to talk (word indistinct) with Guatemalan officials.

Mario Charpentier and I went to Guatemala on Sunday afternoon and held the pertinent conversations, of course, I talked with the foreign minister; Hario talked with the defense minister. The two (?reported to the president), and we reached the conclusion that there was nothing serious--that there is always the same group, which is connected or [words indistinct) with the same group which people say is a (?cell) of world communism and must be smashed.

To me these people are completely half-witted and irrational, and I believe that part of the whole thing was the usual gossiping by Orlando Bosch and the group that helps him, не boasted of (?having support) from other governments [words indistinct] and the important thing was that the Quatemalan Government learned that there was at least talk about a movement and offered, very sincerely in my opinion, all cooperation to avert continued activity of this type.

Minister Charpentier and I came back pleased with the results of our efforts. I wanted to tell you this so there will be no other interpretations of our trip to Guatemala, [ond recording]

Pacio said in connection with the coup brewing in Cuatemala that, unquestionably, there are groups who are interested in violently changing the govermetent to establish a rightist regime, such as the one sponsored by the Free Costa Rica Novement [MCRL).

Asked if this coup plan was related in any way to one former President Jose vigueres was allegedly hatching, Facio said there was no connection. Asked if U.S. citizen Wi1116лвол- a former U.S. Embassy official--had anything to do with it, Facio said he has no concrete: evidence involving him. He added that Williamson has 15 days to leave the country.

The Quatemalan Mano Blancs and the MORL have always been involved in these matters, Facio said. He ended by saying that he has nothing concrete sbout the coup and that his and Charpentier's purpose in going to Quatemala was to gather information and to inform the Quatemalen Coverrment so se may thwart any further coup attempts against Costa Rica,

## OPPOSITION PARTY DEMANDS VESCO'S EXPULSION

Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1648 eur 6 Jul 76 PA

(Text) San Jose, 6 Jul (ACAN-EFK)-The opposition Democratic Renovation Party (PRD] has asked the Supreme Electoral tribunal to have U.S. millionaire Robert L. Vesco expelled from Costa Rica on the charge of meddling in the country's domestic politics. The accusation was made by the wesident of the PRD's Executive Committee, Rodrigo Carazo Odio, based on public charges which have been lodged here..

One of those charges is based on former President Jose Figueres statements to a newsman from Mexico City's newspaper. EXCELSIOR to the effect that Vesco had financed several political parties during the 1974 election campaign. Another one is based on statements by Deputy Sigurd Koberg who some time ago said that Vesco had offered financial aid to his party. Carazo Odio else recalled the incident of a speech delivered by Vesco justifying his presence in Costa Rica, his businesses and his ties with politicians, a speech based on notea drafted by Figueres himself while in office as president.

A constitutional norm foroids foreigners from interfering in domestie politics. Vesco came to Costa Rica in 1972 and immediately caused intense discussions over his Invesments and his ties with known politicans. Here he has escaped from legal action to recover $224 million belonging to the investors Overseas Bervices, a mitual fund which he managed.

Orlando Bosch/Rightist Cuban Activities in the Dominican Republic

1. Forwarded herewith are two Federal Bureau of Investigation reports dated 23 June 1976 concerned with Subject.

2. Your attention is called to paragraph eight, page two, of the report which discusses the Cuban meetings in the Dominican Republic. Although we know of no mountains close to Santo Domingo, we recall that ENFETCH-9 was well known for his "hideway" on a mountaintop "in the clouds" outside of either San Cristobal or Dant. Given the indications that we have received of EMANTHEN-1's interest in Orlando BOSCH, and the occasional "confusion" by EMPYREX-10 and EMPETCH-9 on BOSCH's presence in Santo Domingo, is it possible that EMPETCH-9 might be concealing what he really knows about the BOSCH matter? If anything does turn up along this line, we would be interested in learning about it.

## 'FORMER CIA AGENT' MANUEL DE ARMAS HOLDS PRESS CONFERENCE

Havana Domestic Radio/Television Services in Spanish 0109 GMT 22 Apr 76 FL/PA

(Press conference held by "Former CIA Agent" Manuel de Armas in Havana on 22 April 1976--videotape)

(Text) First of all, I would like to explain that I am going to read a written statement which I have great interest in presenting in such a way that there is no doubt about the quality of its contents. That is why, due to a problem I have in expressing myself in Spanish, I would like to proceed in this manner.

I would like to take this opportunity to denounce what has been a phase of my life, also to briefly explain my presence in this country. My objective: is to openly denounce all immoral acts carried out, directly or indirectly, against Cuba under the sponsorship of the North American government, of which I have knowledge.

I left Cuba 2 years after the triumph of the revolution for family reasons. Thus I was a member of a family which did not know how to or was not able to adapt itself to the life here and opted to live abroad. I attended secondary school and college in the United States until 1969 when I was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency. My relations with the CIA and a number of U.S. repressive organizations began then.

In doing this, great difficulties arise in cases such as mine. There are always many unanswered questions as to my possible motives or political affiliation. My motivation has been created over a period of 5 years of personal, political and ideological degradation resulting in a high degree of personal frustration. Regarding my political affiliation, I unfortunately have none.

I know that many who listen to this press conference abroad will identify me as part of this system. Nevertheless, I would like to make a brief explanation. I want to make it very clear that it is not directed to those who accuse me of being allied to the system, because I do not owe them an explanation. Perhaps, the thing I would like best now is that those who accuse me would be right, but unfortunately their concept of identification, just like mine during the past 5 years, has no meaning in this revolutionary system.

The past 17 years of revolution have not been based on identifications but on principles, principles that many are not capable of recognising precisely because they lack them.

As a North American intelligence agent and, of course, functioning at the service of North American political interests, I lived approximately 5 years in a world of opportunism in an immoral manner of ideological degradation and in an antiprogressive position which have forced me to come to Cuba to denounce these facts from a totally personal viewpoint and under my responsibility, and thus denounce the activities of the CIA and other U.S. governmental organisations which work for that system's interests.

It is necessary to explain certain characteristics which are common to them as part of such a system. In that system I lived, grew, studied and finally functioned as an active part of the intelligence community, and that is why I consider it my right to make the following comments.

In the environment that I lived in until very recently, like others, I was never able to adjust. I do not believe there is any other system like that, capable of developing a lack of personal and social identity due to its capitalist nature, which does not grant values to any type of ideology or social progress but only to an apathetic materialism characteristic of the already degraded interests of that system.

FBIS DIRM 79 (LA) 22 APR 76


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 97

# CUBA

The CIA, as defender of those interests, acts without moral scruples to support them. This system is well-known to all but not all are willing to admit it. We can talk extensively about this, but it is not my intention to point out generalities but facts, facts in which the CIA has participated in activities against revolutionary interests within and without the Republic of Cuba by using counterrevolutionary groups.

Historically, the CIA has been a principal factor in the coordination, financing, direction and absolute control over these counterrevolutionary groups. Oddly enough, they consider themselves bulwarks of rebellion and heroics as well as possessors of a high level of ideological independence in the struggle for recovery of the liberties removed, according to them, by the Cuban revolution. These are the same groups that have carried out various activities against Cuba, financed and coordinated by the CIA. These are the same groups which have proudly assumed responsibility for the cowardly attack against Cuban fishermen last 8 April, which the world will have to judge and condemn.

My relation with these elements began in 1970 and it specifically began with the group ABDALA, of which I was coordinator for the Chicago cell at the very beginning. Later, in 1971, I became ABDALA coordinator for all cells of the midwestern part of the United States. My fundamental mission as CIA agent was to penetrate the ABDALA organization at the highest level in order to concretely evaluate its political orientation, have the necessary information to be able to fully and effectively control the organization and, through it, be able to control other counterrevolutionary organizations associated with ABDALA.

I began my activities by attempting to determine the possible affiliation of some members of the organization with the illegal drug traffic in North America. This CIA task was aimed at ascertaining the relations of these elements with the Cuban Revolutionary Government, in other words, to demonstrate that those persons were acting as counterrevolutionary elements to cover up the illegal drug traffic under orders from the Cuban Government.

After a year of investigations, that theory was not proved. Despite that, the CIA and other organs continued to look for evidence aimed at involving Cuba and distorting its foreign image. In 1971, the CIA leadership decided to transfer me to New York State where I was given the identification of a high-level official in the drug control commission of the state. These activities did not affect my ties to the ABDALA group but, on the contrary, helped strengthen my ties with the organization's board of directors.

I maintained relations with the following CIA officials: Brackenhouse, first CIA agent to contact and recruit me; and Richard (Tomly), staff officer of the McLean, Virginia, Operations office, who conducted my initial training and acted as evaluating supervisor in the ABDALA organization. By then, the main interest of the CIA in ABDALA was in determining the operational capacity of this counterrevolutionary group, the possibility of using it in terrorist activities and predicting its future development. The ABDALA program was known not only to the CIA but also to other governmental organizations and their respective intelligence organs.

At the time the ABDALA leadership, which was tied to terrorist activities, was made up of Gustave Marin, Enrique Hnoinosa, Lazaro Alvares, Eduardo Lima, Leo Viota and myself. The CIA Operations office considered ABDALA to be one of the best possibilities as opposed to the rest of the organization, which are believed to be made up of ineffective elements and sharlatans who waste the agency's funds without any results.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

# VI. 22 Apr 76

Now I vill enumrate the activities of this organisation that wre Nerdimet or directed by the CIA as an organ of the U.S. Goveroment,

CUBA

New York: Through Gustavo Marin I learned about a gmral coordination of ABDALA with persons of other counterrevolutionary groups to create a more conarete and stronger progran of terrorist actions. It is in this manner that ABDALA directly participated in the founding of the so-called Cuban Front of Mtional Liberation (FLNC), whose fundamental objective was to carry out terrorist acts. The talks one founding of the FLNC were held by the ABDALA leadership and Orlando Bosch, ir Vasques Leyve and Dr Humberto Pontana. I was introduced to a counterrevolutionary by the name of Outierres, a militant of ABDALA who directly participated in the terevrina against the Cuban Consulate in Madrid, Spain. A powerful explosive was placed at the entrance of the Cuban offices in Madrid, causing severe material damages. Two offices wre totally destroyed and the rest of the offions were seriously damaged as well as other floors of the building where the consulate was located. Present at the tim of the explosion vere the Cuban consul, his wife and other officials.

Knowledge of plans of terrorist acts against Venezuelan tourist offices in Puerto Rico: These acts were carried out by Juan de Dios who resided in Puerto Rica. They were developed in reprisal for the temporary detention of Orlando Bosch in Venezuelan territory and were of course made known to the CIA by mm. Nothing was form to stop them. The CIA also know of and coordinated through ABDALA a publig event in New York City when a terrorist act was to be carried out against the building of the Cuban mission to the United Nations using molotov cocktails. This was called off by the CIA through officer Brackenhouse when some contradictions arose in coordinating with the FBI on how it should be dorm.

The CIA krew of attacks by persons residing in Miami against Cuban fishing vessels 1 international waters in which leader Gustavo Harin directly participated, cesar Sanches, & CIA informer, also took part.

Knowledge by the CIA and coordination of terrorist activity against the Cuban Embassy in Montreal, Canada: In this second attempt, the ABDALA group, which was going to use as liaison, was given a certain quantity of explosives. I must explain that this was not carried out because the required prior coordination with the ROMP, the Canadian authorities, was not made, even though the coordination with too far had been made. In personal conversations held with FBI agents, the NSA--thia 18 the National Security Agonoy--and representatives of the Justice Department at the federal level, which took place in the Federal Building of the southern district in the City of Manhattan, the possibility of controlling the activities of these terperist groups inside 1.3. territory was discussed. However, despite the talks, wethat is, the GIA--did not interrupt the activities in these terrorist programs, in conversationa with the ABDALA leadership, I learned of possible attempts on the Itros of artain individuels in exile who had defrauded the counterrevolution. This doer place onts before the death of the notorious counterrevolutionary leader Joan de la oriento. I also learned about the attack on the Hispano Warehouse in New York City beause it vas sending goods to Cuba. This was carried out by ABDALA miiibank purnando Piratelle, The sotivity was authorised by the CIA to determine how far tie AHLIALA terrorist- apparatus would go. Ry then, Bob (Dynus), a CIA officer who supplied explosives, was participating in the operational program with ABDALA, Dor. (Dynus) now works in GIA programs related to Chile.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 99

22 Apr 76

The CIA knew about and approved acts against the Cutane de briscion offices in Bestse City. Participating in this act was lee Victa, an Affald States to traveled to Besice from Venezuela.

Knowledge by the CIA of personal contacts with representatives of the present Chilean Government in New York City to take Orlando Bosche Chile after his arrest in Venez Representing ABDALA as Enrique. Encinoss, who is a rabid atmirer of Orlando Bosch, and representing the Chilean intelligence services vas ir Julio Solose,

Enowledge by the CIA of the financing of ABDALA by the uitraright John Birch Boctoty and the Latin American Club of the University of Illinoiss Participating in the talks on financing was Senator Buckley of the U.S. Congress, who maintains close relations with ABDALA leader Encinosa as well as the notorious Carlos Prio Socarres and Nicaraguan President Somoza.

CIA coordinated a program for collecting funds for ANDALA, extorting cash from the President of the Republic National Bank in Niant and assassinating Rolando Masferrer. Por the killing of Rolando Masferrer, CIA officer Robert "Bob" Kills gave no four packages (petacas) of C-4. I personally gave then to Lazar Alvares, a leader of ABDALA Later, as everybody knows, Masferrer was murdered,

I must explain that my relations with CIA officer Mills came about because of his experience in Cuban problems. He acted as liaison officer between the CIA and the Justice and Defense departments. These are all the activities that I personally participated in as a CIA agent. I will now enumerate other activities which I learned about during my stay in the United States and while traveling in other countries. I had no direct participation in these programs. At this time I would like to explain that, even though I say that I had no direct participation there should be no doubt as to the veracity of the following events. I mainly learned about these things through official sources, and that is work, comrades,

Attempt on the life of Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro during his stay in Chile: It was prepared and directed by the CIA, which introduced counterrevolutionary Antonio (Beciana) to the Alfa-66 organization, requesting from its chief, Nazario Sargent, the sen needed. The (Ichambers) and diplomatic passports were prepared by the CIA. Parti- ofpating for Alfa in this activity were Jesus Dominguez Benites and several others.

Kidnaping cô Cuban fishermen in May 1970: It was directed by the notcricus CIA agent Ramon Orosco Crespo and Raul Carreras, foraer member of the 2506 Brigade who participated in the Playa Giron landing. This activity was also carried out by members of Alfa-66. In activities against Cuban fishing boats, counterrevolutionary Roberto Tur acted as permanent informer, establishing the positions of the boats, de lives at 12th Avenue between 8th and 9th Streets in southwest Miami.

Other activities carried out by Alfa-66 were: Attack on the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City in the early hours of 20 January 1974, when two explosive devices were used. One exploded and the other, which did not explode, was huried at the children's playground et the Cuban Mission. In the early hours of 5 August 1974, a bomb exploded in the garden of the Cuban Embassy in Jamaica, In October 1974, the Bahamian authorities captured seven Cuban counterrevolutionaries who, on orders of the Alfa-66 organisation, were going to infiltrate Cuba through the northern coast of Oriente Province, They were to land Luis Lobaina and Aristides Marques armed with M-1 carbines and pistols with silencers. The objective of this mission was to assassinatie Prime Minister Fidel Castro.

PCD ATTACKS POLITICAL LEADER PEREZ

Santo Domingo Radio Clarin Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 6 Apr 76 PL

[Text] The Dominican Communist Party (PCD) today asserted that if Luis Julian Perez becomes president he will persecute PCD members. The PCD Political Committee, in a press statement sent to Radio Clarin, indicates that Julian Perez has retreated and postponed his anticommunist offensive. The former chairman of the National Development Commission had asserted that he would disclose the names of each member of the communist party that holds positions with the government.

The PCD adds in its statement that Julian Perez now states that he never said it. In fact, he contradicts himself, retreats and is avoiding a political confrontation in which he can only lose. The PCD also points out that his statement was nothing but a gross lie.

MEMBERSHIP IN SUGAR PRODUCERS UNION OPPOSED

Santo Domingo Radio Clarin Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 7 Apr 76 PL

[Station commentary]

[Text] We have insistently said that to belong to the famous Union of Latin American Sugar Producers--to which the Philippines has been added--is not (word indistinct) or beneficial to the Dominican Republic because there is a notable difference between producing and exporting countries and in their respective interests.

We have also criticised the series of limitations imposed on the Dominican Republic by virtue of meetings held and commitments acquired. Those limitations and commitments are made in exchange for nothing because a country that produces sugar but does not export it has nothing to lose in agreeing to limitations on its free right to negotiate, to sell, and so forth.

Right now the Philippines has acquired a contract on sugar sales for a 5-year period with a U.S. refinery amounting to 650,000 tons annually. Did the Dominican Republic know anything about this? Or did it learn about it, as we did, from international news dispatches? What prior consultations were made? How does this (agree) with the famous meetings and agreements of Cozumel, Puerto Plata, Lima and Cali?

It is not that we believe the deal with the Philippines will have any effect on the price of sugar or the market; however, we take the opportunity to stress this example and make known the reason we have had and have to criticize the Dominican Republic's entry in an international group from which we will get no benefits.

AUTHORITIES DENY ARRIVAL OF ANTI-CASTRO LEADER

Santo Domingo Radio Clarin Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 30 Mar 76 PL

![BK stamp]

[Excerpts] It is not true that anti-Castro exile Orlando Bosch is in the Dominican Republic, Immigration Director General Commodore (Ret) Enrique Rafael Valdes Vidaurre declared today. He added that a report to the effect that Dr Bosch had been expelled from Costa Rica to our country was journalistic speculation. The report had been made in San Jose, Costa Rica, last night by a spokesman for the government of President Daniel Oduber.

The Foreign Relations Secretariat today also pointed out that it had no knowledge that Bosch had been expelled to our country on orders of the Costa Rican Supreme Court after many countries consulted by the government of that Central American country refused to admit the anti-Castro exile.

# Extraño aislamiento del doctor Bosch

Del Movimiento Costa Rica Libre, recibimos la siguiente comunicación:

"La incomunicación de que es objeto el Dr. Orlando Bosch, dirigente anti-comunista cubano con más de veinticinco años de lucha, primero contra la dictadura de Batista y luego contra la dictadura comunista de Fidel Castro, es una vergüenza para el prestigio internacional de nuestro país.

La negación de asistencia médica adecuada y la prohibición de que un abogado le visite son una clara violación de los Derechos Humanos. Si el señor Ministro de Seguridad Pública después de haber manifestado públicamente que no le importaba que el señor Bosch continuara en huelga de hambre, anuncia ahora -sin que podamos confirmar- que le ha dado este Gobierno asistencia médica, ello ha sido obligados por la presión del Movimiento Costa Rica Libre que amenazó con denunciar esta actitud ante Amnistía Internacional en Londres y ante la Comisión de Derechos Humanos en New York.

La actitud del Gobierno de Costa Rica con el dirigente anticomunista G. Bosch, contrasta con la asumida con el terrorista marxista Allenda, quien disfruta en nuestro país de todos los derechos y comodidades necesarias brindados por las vateras oficiales.

¿Cuál es la razón para inantener aislado al Dr. Bosch como si fuese un delincuente común? ¿Por qué no se permite ser visto por un médico de su confianza? ¿Por qué no puede ser visitado por un abogado? ¿Va el Dr. Orlando Bosch a permanecer en una cárcel indefinidamente hasta que algún pais le reciba? ¿Es esta la forma como el Gobierno de Costa Riva entiende los Derechos Humanos?

Resulta extraño que al Ministro de Seguridad Pública que ahora no contesta interpelaciones de quienes como contribuyen pagamos su sueldo, le moleste que se haga publicidad alrededor de un caso que tiene alarmados a la opinión pública, pero si permiten toda clase de publicidad cuando se trata de detenidos de filiación comunista. ¿Cuales las presiones y de dónde presiones Nación comunica Cables cuatre el señor Ministro pere que to ya tumedo asta actitud?

Todos cunaremmas la situación antwomunista del Ministro. Intune, per qu actúa asi?

NO COMMENT: REFUSES TO ACCEPT CUBAN EXILE

Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0229 GMT 19 Mar 76 PA

[Text] San Jose, Costa Rica, 18 Mar--The fate of exiled Cuban leader Orlando Bosch has been complicated by the fact that no government in the hemisphere is willing to grant him territorial asylum.

Meanwhile, Bosch began today his 7th day on a hunger strike which he is staging to call attention to his case, and is accepting only water in his cell in the prison of Cartago, east of San Jose, where he is being held.

Bosch was deprived of his freedom when his presence and illegal entry into Costa Rica were proved. He used a Chilean passport with a false name to enter the country shortly before U.S. Secretary of Stat. Henry A. Kissinger's official visit.

Bosch's deportation has been ordered, but no government has shown any willingness to receive him. Today, Foreign Affairs Minister Consalo J. Facio negotiated with a country not previously consulted--one of the latest to be approved--Facio explained. The results of these negotiations were negative.

Apparently, Bosch's guerrilla background influences these rejections.

The anti-Castro leader claims to be a victim of the circles which foster a reconciliation with Prime Minister Fidel Castro's regime.

## FACIO ON CUBAN-COSTA RICAN RAPPROCHEMENT

Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0036 GMT 23 Mar 76 PA

[Text] San Jose, Costa Rica, 22 Mar--(ACAN-EFE)--Costa Rican Foreign Minister Consalo J. Facio this afternoon rejected criticism by newsmen who have said he is propitiating a rapprochement with the Cuban regime. Facio said that the Castroite adventure in Angola and the proletarian internationalism doctrine it represents have thrown cold water on the possibility of renewing relations with that island.

The minister thus responded to a newspaper editorial which noted the dangerous inclination of the Foreign Ministry toward reconciliation with Cuba at a time when, according to the commentary, the Havana regime has decided to embark on an expansive and aggressive foreign policy.

Facio rejected this criticism and freed his ministry from all responsibility for what officials from other ministries said or did after their trip to Cuba. Some have praised the system in effect there.

The foreign minister commented that the adventure in Angola and the theory advanced by Cuba--according to which it is prepared to back insurrections provoked by communist movements--are very much taken into account by Costa Rica and are considered to be enough reason for cooling the possibility of a renewal of relations with Havana.

Facio also said that he did not share the opinion of the New York TIMES which commented that Jamaica and Guyana have become beachheads for Cuban penetration in the hemisphere.

## Orlando Bosch no variará su vida como terrorista

![photo description]

Lisboa, (Densa). Fue inútil la presión de los Estados Unidos para lograr que a Orlando Bosch se le tratara como terrorista. La decisión ya está tomada: No se le extraditará a Miami, sino que se le mandará a un país de América por las variadas aventuras en que se ha visto envuelto en su larga e historial lucha contra el régimen de Fidel Castro.

Bosch, de 66 años, de edad considera que es un hospital ambulante. El único de los cinco jefes contrarrevolucionarios de las Villas que logró escapar con vida de Cuba, hace más de 18 años, ha sido operado dos veces de úlceras, ha recibido 81 transfusiones de sangre y suposiciones que tiene poco que perder, incluyendo la vida.

Bosch, arrestado en San José el 18 de febrero, se encuentra recluido actualmente en la cárcel de Cartago y regresar (cuale Hire para (unapita cuatre le sale del Dethur Als Lager, durante la visita de este a nuestro país, ha llegado a ser muy conocido en el ámbito latinoamericano y con sus antecedentes puros países se han mostrado interesados en darle asilo excepto en los que tiene pendientes varias cuentas con la justicia.

Bosch disfruta en la cárcel de una libertad de movimientos excepcionales y ha captado la simpatía de todos.

Antes de ser referido a la cárcel de Cartago, mientras estuve por un agente de la Central de Inteligencia Norteamericana, según manifiesta:

"Un señor macho, con el pelo chuzo, hablando con acento inglés y acompañado de un perrito faldero cubano de apellido Menéndes estuve a interrogarme en la Tercera Compañía. Aunque inicialmente acepté responder a unas preguntas, me incliné bus se llama asimismo el hombre que ha tenido que resolver la dignidad tantas veces mancillada del pueblo cubano, "pues alguien tiene que saber poner en alto su hidalguía".

Afirma tambiés que es parte de un frente continental de lucha contra el régimen de Fidel Castro.

Asegura que, "hemos castigado duramente al enemigo en América" y cita el caso del embajador cubano en Argentina, "el enlace entre la izquierda argentina y el comunismo cubano, el cual escapó milagrosamente de un atentado".

Opina firmemente que Castro está ampliando su esfera de influencia en América, gracias a la actitud feminoide de políticos y gobernantes, entre los cuales incluyó también a los nuestros.

Dijo que los diplomáticos latinoamericanos son figuras feminoides disfrazadas para los bufets, las comilonas y la intriga.

Expresó que, por un lado Castro está protegido por los Estados Unidos y por otro por los diplomáticos y políticos blendengues.

Cuando un periodista le preguntó si se podía comparar a Pascal Allende con Matos, señaló que era absurdo, pues en su opinión eso equivaldría a mancillar la memoria de un hombre valiente como. Matos, preso actualmente en las mazmorras del; régimen de Costro,

Refiriéndose a los métodos violentos a veces empleados por.cubanos anticastristas, declaró: "La violencia puede ser moble, Justa, digna, o no. Nosotros luchamos solos los por nuestra patria, y racionalmente la defendemos",

Dijo por ejemplo que aquí mismo en Costa Ilica, un país al que creía libre y en el cual la gente podía axiturse, había Interés en hacerle daño. "Aquello del atentado a Kissinger es una falucia. Ningún cubano atacó nunca a funcionarios norteameri

La posibilidad de que hoy se inicie en esta capital la reunión de jefes de gobierno de Centroamérica está condicionada por la falta de acuerdo sobre la sede y la hora en que habrá de realizarse y un mínimo programa de asuntos.

Hasta ahora el principal obstáculo para que se efectúe es la insistencia nicaragüense en incluir en la agenda la aprobación de un documento sobre la situación en El Salvador y con sus ulteriores derivaciones.

Nicaragua, en cambio, pretende varias cuentas pendientes con la Justicia.

Bosch declaró que tiene una misión que cumplir y que, no importa donde el gobierno lo mande, ahí encara- rá a su auerte: "Seguiré lu- chando racionamente como to he hecho hasta ahora. Seguiré envuelto en activida- des conspirativas. Nadie de- be tenerme miedo, exceptó les comunistas", dijo Bosch.

Bosch Ingreso al país a principios de este año con un pasaporte faiso a nombre de otro, según afirma, con el propósito da permanecer unos días fuera de acción, descansando. "No pensaba en realidad disfrutar del sol y la playa, pues como solía advertir Marti: "Los pue blos deben tomarse un des canso pero no aus lideras".

Sin embargo, constidoré que podía hacer una pausa aqul. No tenía interés en compro- meter al Gobierno. Después de lo que me han hecho me voy desilusionado", añadió. Repuso que el pasaporte falsificado no es chileno, si- no un pasaporte emitido en La Habana y que estaba en un ex-militar chile-

Ningúr cubano atacó nunca a funcionarios norteameri canos. Pero, como tantos otros países de América, en Costa Rica políticos y diplo. máticos como el señor Facio le siguen haciendo el juego a Castro", dijo Bosch.

Añadió que nadie ha hecho tanto para dejar sin efecto el bloqueo a Cuba que el señor Facio y sin embargo, Castro le ha respondido en forma ri pida. Eso demuestra, dijo, que él es un peligro que hay que combatir.

1. In a meeting with Assistant Secretary Rogers today, he told me that he had learned from Foreign Minister Facio that Bosch, at the time of his arrest in San Jose during the Kissinger visit, had two recently issued passports from the current Chilean government. Facio also said that 10 to 12 persons also had come into Costa Rica with Bosch but the Costa Ricans do not know who they are nor have they been able to locate them. I mentioned to Rogers that a U.S. Secret Service agent had interviewed Bosch.

2. In view of State's interest in this case, I suggest you send a cable to San Jose and try to find out the number of these Chilean passports and to whom they were issued. Also it might be worthwhile to have a summary of what Bosch and the U.S. Secret Service agent talked about.

# BOSCH GRLANDO

## VI. 27 Feb 76

No advantage can be gained and no good conclusions reached from a visit which lasted less than a day and during which he spoke for only a half hour with each foreign minister, the first secretary of the Soviet Embassy said.

In this regard, Socialist Action Party Deputy Nora Valverde said Kissinger's visit was a failure for U.S. Imperialism, since the chiefs of state who had been invited to the meeting decided not to come, considering Dr Kissinger's visit of little interest.

Nothing can be achieved in such a short period of time, the Soviet official said.

Regarding former President Nixon's visit to the PRC, the Soviet official said it will not affect Soviet foreign policy in any way. It is only another of the many tourist of courtesy trips to the PRC. This is why we do not attribute any importance to it, he said.

Regarding Fidel Castro's participation in the CPSU congress which began 2 days ago, Mr Arnold Mosclov said all countries in the world were represented at the congress, but that the visitors were participating as observers in the discussions of what the Soviet people have done and will do in the field of development.

The Soviet official said regarding Cuba's intervention in Angola: The Cuban Government is helping Angola because the latter needs it. Previously, when the U.S. Government blocked aid to Cuba, the latter had to ask for the Soviet Union's cooperation, because it was being suffocated by the economic blockade imposed by the U.S. Government. How the Angolan people had to ask for Cuba's help because the United States refused to help and in addition was blocking aid.

On this issue of the peoples' liberation struggle the blame lies with the United States, the first secretary of the Soviet Embassy concluded.

## CUBAN EXPTLLED FOR PLOT AGAINST PASCAL ALLENDE

Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0123 GMT 26 Feb 76 PA

[Excerpt] San Jose, 25 Feb--(ACAN-EFE)--The Costa Rican Government ordered anti-Castro Cuban Orlando Bosch to leave the country. He is allegedly involved in a plan to attack Chilean Marxist Leader Andres Pascal Allende, in exile in Costa Rica.

It was reported that Bosch, who entered this country on 19 February, resides in the Dominican Republic and entered Costa Rica with a Chilean passport.

He categorically denied any links with subversive groups and the authorities were unable to prove this association, but as a preventive measure they ordered him to leave the national territory.

THEIR INTEREST WAS INTENSIFIED BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF BOSCH'S INVOLVEMENT WITH BOMBINGS, NOT ONLY IN CONNECTION WITH RECENT BOMBINGS IN COSTA RICA BUT ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH KISSINGER'S VISIT..

AND BRINDER (AND POSSIBLY LOURDES) WERE STUDYING MEDICINE
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN CARLOS IN GUATEMALA. AS A RESULT
OF THE EARTHQUAKE, THEY LEFT GUATEMALA FOR COSTA RICA ON

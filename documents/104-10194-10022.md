MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Balmes N. Hidalgo, Jr.

SUBJECT: Exceptional Service Emblem

1.  Your request for consideration to receive the Exceptional Service Emblem has been reviewed by this office to determine your eligibility for the award. With considerable regret, I must concur in the assessment that the injuries you suffered in the line of duty do not fall under the special criteria governing award of the Exceptional Service Emblem. Hazardous duties, in the meaning of the governing regulation, relate to duties performed in areas in which internal strife, civil disturbances or hostile action by armed forces or persons unfriendly to the United States were present at the time the injury was incurred, or, relate to duties performed in an assignment defined as hazardous due to unusual geographic or other natural conditions.

2.  You may be sure that this decision has been based upon thoughtful deliberation. Please accept my personal thanks for a job well done under difficult conditions.

NAPRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training.

Mr. Hidalgo is a man of unusual background even in our unusual organization. This background undoubtedly affords him qualifications for our work, but nevertheless, on the professional level he suffers from disadvantages as well--overcoming some but not others. He is not well-educated in a formal sense, and in our world of words is not adequately equipped to prepare finished written correspondence. He has difficulty in organizing his work systematically, thus at times, giving an impression that the preparation has not been thorough--which might not really have been true.

On the other hand, Mr. Hidalgo has the advantage of native fuency in Spanish and an obvious understanding of the Latin thinking process and culture. He is broadly experienced in operations, not only as a case officer but as an actual agent himself, having served four years as a Bureau penetration of the CPUSA. He is operationally imaginative and unquestionably possesses the ingenuity and courage to translate ideas into action. In this respect, however, his efforts must be channeled and selectivity exercised. On the Panamà Desk this officer provides the valuable service of operational history and continuity; he served six years in the Station and has been on the desk for three.

BY REVIEVING OFFICIAL

Mr. Hidalgo is an experienced and well qualified operations officer, and it is indeed unfortunate that there are medical problems which do not allow hin to be assigned overseas. Since Mr. Hidalgo cannot be assigned overseas, I too endorse his desire to be assigned to OTR or to another assignment of his choice.

# SECTION C Continued

Hidalgo, Balmes N.

Mr. Hidalgo is a gregarious uncomplicated person, generally pleasant, and generous in his instincts--but not entirely without his quixotic side--and one whose natural Latin emotionality has been intensified by a life of experiences outside the norm, e.g. years as a CP penetration, air crashes, war wounds, etc.

This officer is aware that his intellectual background and medical debilities are obstructions to his advance. Understandably, he has developed outside interests, apparently as compensation. Expectedly, his attitudes at times so reflect.

In sum, Mr. Hidalgo serves a satisfactory function on the Panama Desk and no doubt could continue to perform so indefinitely, but in view of his limitations in a desk-bound situation and the medical restrictions, both of which will continue to inhilit his advance in his present component, this supervisor endorses Mr. Hidalgo's desire to be considered for transfer to another component, namely OTR (specifically covert training), where his attributes would likely come more directly into play. He has the operational experience, competency in a foreign language, an outgoing personality, and experience in lecturing and teaching.* Finally, regardless of the shortcomings reflected in this evaluation, the grading officer finds much to admire in Mr. Hidalgo personally.

*Should a suitable opening in that field be unavailable, it is felt there would be merit also in considering Mr. Hidalgo's other stated interests, i.e., the technical interrogation section of the Office of Security or 00 Contacts Division.

Comment by Mr. Tsikerdanos, previous supervisor

$51$ fl1 $'67

Mr. Hidalgo is a very capable case officer who is more suited to a field position. He is adept at handling indigenous personnel and has a keen operational mind. He is good at grasping operational leads but is not a capable writer. He has trouble expressing himself on paper. His Spanish language capability is a decided asset to the Branch. A longstanding illness has limited his effectiveness at the Desk. He is cost conscious and has no supervisory responsibilities.

Comments by Present Supervisor:

I concur in the above estimate of Mr. Hidalgo's operational capabilities. During the months (Oct 1966 - March 1967) I have worked with Mr. Hidalgo I have not found his health to be a factor in his performance of his duties.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Mr. Hidalgo's health caused him to be absent from his duties several times during the first part of 1966 but these absences were for a limited period. From my observation, his health has not presented a serious problem to the performance of his duties.

Several times during the absence of Mr. Tsikerdanos in the year 1966 Mr. Hidalgo was the acting desk officer. His performance was most satisfactory, and his supervision of the other desk employees, albeit for a limited period, was fully satisfactory.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Mr. Hidalgo is an able intelligence officer, devoted to his profession and selfless in his desire to be of service to the Government. Although he has suffered ill health in recent years, he was insistent that he be among the first to be sent to the Dominican Republic when the crisis occurred.

An intense person, Mr. Hidalgo is industrious, works well under pressure and sets high standards for his performance. Because he is intent on getting things done, he is occasionally hasty in judgment and in written presentation of the results of his research and conclusions. He is perceptive, quickly accepts suggestions and offers counter-proposals with cogent argument. Mr. Hidalgo was not in a supervisory capacity. He was cost conscious; always endeavoring to be conservative where possible He is an effective and cooperative member of an office, ready to assume responsibility and to help his colleagues. Thanks to his unique experience on the Cuban target, he has wide knowledge of the Cuban problem and is, in fact, an expert on the Cuban Security and Intelligence Services.

I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo with exception to the statement that Subject works well under pressure. He is indeed an intense person and, under great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even more important, it has a very bad effect on his health. With this consideration noted, the undersigned thinks very highly of Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.

From 25 June-9 August 1962, Mr. Hidalgo was on TDI for WH/3 as escort officer for Latin American trainees. Although beset by health and other personal problems, Mr. Hidalgo seized upon each new assignment with his customary energy. He proved particularly adept in working as interproter and escort officer for Latin American trainees, and demonstrated high interest and proven competence in counterintelligence work. His excellent memory and quick perception were distinct assets in these undertakings.

It is recommended, however, that Mr. Hidalgo's next assignment not carry responsibility for submission of finished papers or staff studies, but be one entailing duties commensurate with his ability to work effectively with indigenous personnel and to pursue CI leads through records investigation.

Mr. Hidalgo has done a fine job during the reporting period, while assigned to the CI Section of the Branch when it was in its most active period of buildup and operations.

Mr. Hidalgo is an able intelligence officer, devoted to his profession and selfless in his desire to be of service to the Government. Although he has suffered ill health in recent years, he was insistent that he be among the first to be sent to the Dominican Republic when the crisis occurred.

An intense person, Mr. Hidalgo is industrious, works well under pressure and sets high standards for his performance. Because he is intent on getting things done, he is occasionally hasty in judgment and in written presentation of the results of his research and conclusions. He is perceptive, quickly accepts suggestions and offers counter-proposals with cogent argument. Mr. Hidalgo was not in a supervisory capacity. He was cost conscious; always endeavoring to be conservative where possible
He is an effective and cooperative member of an office, ready to assume responsibility and to help his colleagues. Thanks to his unique experience on the Cuban target, he has wide knowledge of the Cuban problem and is, in fact, an expert on the Cuban Security and Intelligence Services.

I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo with exception to the statement that Subject works well under pressure. He is indeed an intense person and, under great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even more important, it has a very bad effect on his health. With this consideration noted, the undersigned thinks very highly of Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.

State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be documented if applicable.

Mr. Hidalgo's fluent knowledge of Cuban Spanish, his previous experience in DD/P Cuban operations, and his broad knowledge of Cuba (people, geography, customs, etc.) made him a particularly useful and versatile operations officer during his assignment in the WH/SA counterintelligence operations section. As indicated in Section B (specific duties) he performed a wide variety of duties.

Mr. Hidalgo approached and performed his assignments with enthusiasm, keenness, dedication, and promptness. He displayed a particular talent for conducting debriefings, and it was in this type activity that he performed best. He also writes well which added to his debriefing capability as well as to his performance as a Headquarters desk operations officer in writing cables, dispatches, memoranda, etc. Mr. Hidalgo is cost conscious and effective in the use of space, equipment and funds. He does not hold a supervisory position.

Mr. Hidalgo performed most of his duties with a minimum of supervision. In a few instances, however, he had a tendency (in his eagerness and desire to get the job done well) to become impatient with the slow and deliberate pace of progress which is sometimes necessary in operational activities. In these few instances, Mr. Hidalgo's work required supervision by a senior operations officer.

Mr. Hidalgo is a sound operations officer with native fluency in Spanish. His impatience is with administrative delays rather than with operational problems which he understands fully and handles well. He has had problems with his health but these largely have been overcome and in the past 9 months have not impeded his operational usefulness. As of the date of this fitness report, he appears fully capable of handling any CI or FI operation assigned to him.

He devotes an inordi- nate amount of his own personal time to his duties in an effort to achieve perfection and sets very high standards for his own performance The person being rated speaks native Spanish and is able to accomplish all of his interrogations in Spanish. This ability is a great asset to him in his work and redounds in benefits to the KUDESK effort of the Station.

The person being rated is an accomplished interrogator and thus receives very little guidance in his work. His ability to trap security suspects in contradictions is unique and is paying dividends in the WAVE KUDESK field of endeavor. He has shown mature judgment in the handling of complex security cases, balance in appraising the interrogation results and in recommending disposal action, and proficiency in the preparation of his interrogation reports. He is currently super- vising the interrogation activities of three KUJUMP interrogators and has shown an ability in establishing personal rapport with these interrogators and proficiency in drecting their activities. It is recommended from the standpoint of his career development that after the completion of his current assignment, the person being rated be moved into an assignment involving the handling of agents in the KUDESK field of effort.

Mr. Hidalgo joined WH/PO/A in November 1961 and took up those responsibilities listed above. However, Mr. Hidalgo's performance of duties was interrupted on two occasions by serious illness, 9-27 March and 15 April-31 May 1962. He was twice hospitalized. From 25 June-9 August 1962, Mr. Hidalgo was on TDY for WH/3 as escort officer for Latin American trainees. Although beset by health and other personal problems, Mr. Hidalgo seized upon each new assignment with his customary energy. He proved particularly adept in working as interpreter and escort officer for Latin American trainees, and demonstrated high interest and proven competence in counterintelligence work. His excellent memory and quick perceptior. were distinct assets in these undertakings.

It is recommended, however, that Mr. Hidalgo's next assignment not carry responsibility for submission of finished papers or staff studies, but be one entailing duties commensurate with his ability to work effectively with indigenous personnel and to pursue CI leads through records investigation.

REMARKS BY GOVERNOR JOHN Y. BROWN
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JULY 12, 1984

My friends, for years, Kentucky has been the land of beautiful horses and fast basketball. Now, we are known as the home of Wendell Ford and Walter Huddleston. For years, we sent colorful characters to Washington. Now, we send statesmen.

Walter Mondale needed two things to be President. One, a winning record. Two, a strong team to help him govern. In 1980, he needed to carry at least 20 states to win. He carried only 13, In 1984, he must carry at least 30.

He needed somebody who knew how to carry states, who could pull the votes from the South. He came to Kentucky and found Martha Layne Collins. She is an outstanding running mate.

He needed somebody who knew the mind of the people, who understood their hopes and dreams. He chose a brilliant and compassionate woman.

He needed somebody who would give him a broader base and more appeal. He selected a Governor who had achieved the unusual: the ability to communicate with all people. He went to Kentucky and found Martha Layne Collins.

In 1980, the Republicans carried Kentucky by 160,000 votes. It had been 20 years since they had won the state. In 1983, Martha Layne Collins brought Kentucky back to the Democratic Party and into the future.

With Walter Mondale, she will do that for America.

Vote Democratic.

Paid for by the Democratic National Committee, Charles T. Manatt, Chairman

HAVE YOU EVER DON'T HAVE YOUR OWN MONEY TO SPEND?

> [Figure: Text and symbols indicating the potential problem of not having personal funds.]

AND YOU ARE IN A TROUBLE TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT YOUR NEED? HERE, I WILL GIVE YOU THE SIMPLE IDEA HOW TO GENERATE YOUR OWN INCOME:

1.  SELL YOUR PRELOVED ITEMS. IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOTHES, BOOKS, OR TOYS THAT YOU NO LONGER USE, YOU CAN SELL IT. YOU CAN OFFER IT TO YOUR FRIENDS OR NEIGHBORS. OR YOU CAN TRY TO POST IT ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA.
2.  OPEN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR OWN MONEY, YOU CAN PUT IT ON SAVINGS ACCOUNT. BESIDES SAFE, YOU CAN ALSO EARN INTEREST FROM IT.
3.  INVEST YOUR MONEY. IT'S DIFFERENT WITH SAVINGS ACCOUNT, INVESTING YOUR MONEY MEANS YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE A RISK. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN TO INVEST, YOU CAN DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR PARENTS. IF YOU'RE READY, YOU CAN TRY TO INVEST IN STOCKS, BONDS, OR MUTUAL FUNDS.
4.  START A SMALL BUSINESS. IF YOU ARE CREATIVE, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN HANDICRAFT AND SELL IT TO YOUR FRIENDS OR NEIGHBORS. OR IF YOU LIKE TO BAKE, YOU CAN MAKE COOKIES OR CAKES AND SELL IT ONLINE OR OFFLINE.
5.  TAKE ONLINE SURVEYS. THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES THAT OFFER ONLINE SURVEYS. YOU CAN EARN MONEY BY COMPLETING SURVEYS.
6.  PARTICIPATE IN ONLINE CONTESTS. THERE ARE MANY ONLINE CONTESTS THAT OFFER CASH PRIZES. YOU CAN TRY TO JOIN SOME CONTESTS THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN.

BE PATIENT AND PERSISTENT. BUILDING AN INCOME TAKES TIME AND EFFORT. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED IF YOU DON'T SEE RESULTS IMMEDIATELY. JUST KEEP WORKING HARD AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS.

GOOD LUCK!!!

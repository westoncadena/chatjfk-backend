MURRAY HILL 6-5121

February 20,1963

Mr. Miguel A. Diaz Isalgue
1343 N E Miami Court
Apartment 17
Miami 32, Florida

Dear Mr. Diaz:

This will confirm our previous discussions with you wherein we agreed to employ you at the rate of $210.00 per month to commence March 1st. As was explained to you at our last meeting, we are engaged in a study to determine the effect of large scale migration on given communities and the dislocations that result therefrom.

We feel that the Miami area is unique in that the dislocations caused by the influx of so many of your fellow countrymen furnishes an excellent opportunity to conduct this study.

It is anticipated that you will spend a large portion of your time in our New York offices, however; it will also require a substantial amount of travel on your part.

If you are still in agreement with this proposal please advise me as soon as possible. I would like to begin this study on March 1st.

Very truly yours,

![signature]
Roger Joyce

In the period April to December 1964, Subject was the Chief of JMWAVE's Paramilitary Branch. In this capacity he was charged with the responsibility of mounting successful paramilitary operations into a denied area. Subject met his responsibilities in an exemplary manner and his Branch did mount successful operations into PBRUMEN in which intelligence was collected, resistance nuclei were established in the rural areas of PBRUMEN, and in- and exfiltration routes were developed whereby supplies and men could be moved in and out of PBRUMEN. In addition, his Branch maintained a UDT and a Commando unit in a high state of combat readiness. The UDT and Commando units were not used operationally in their specialties because of policy prohibitions against committing them against the PBRUMEN target; however, they were available to meet contingency situations. Subject's performance as a Branch Chief was characterized by drive, dedication, reliability, imagination, and the use of sound first-echelon manage- ment techniques. Subject is realistic and effective in delegating authority and responsibility to his subordinates. Subject has the ability to weld into a cohesive unit a diverse group of men who are Staff agents, Career Agents, Contract Employees, and military person- nel on detail to KUBARK. This quality of leadership developed sound principles of team work in the PM Branch and made it easy for the Branch to coordinate its activities with the programs of the other Branches in a Station that has over 300 employees and is engaged in.

FI, CI, PW, PM, Maritime, Air, and operations. Subject is cost-conscious and effective in the use of space and equipment.

In the period January to March 1965, Subject filled the role of Special Assistant to the Chief of Station JMWAVE and, as such, was the operational supervisor for the establishment of a frame of reference in which a counter-insurgency program could be developed and implemented in Peru. In this phase of his activities, Subject's work had the hallmark of sound professionalism and reflected favorably on Subject's judgment, Spanish language fluency, area knowledge, and dedication to duty.

The totality of the information outlined above leads the Rating Officer to conclude that Subject's over-all performance warrants an evaluation of Strong.

Subject is a flexible, broad-gauged officer who has experience in depth in FI, CI, PW, PM and Maritime operations. In addition, he has a proven record of sustained performance whereby he has established that he can be counted on to do the job in less than allowable time limits. In view of these factors, it is believed that Subject is a valuable asset to his career service and, as such, can meet the long-term needs of his service in Latin America or other Spanish-speaking areas.

Continuation Sheet / FITNESS REPORT - Section C:

Subject is a dedicated officer who has proven by performance that he can be counted on to get the job done in less than allowable timo limits. Subject is a sound first-echelon supervisor of a group doing a basic paramilitary job. Subject has the ability to develop a sense of teamwork in a diverse group of employees. It is believed that this leadership trait is particularly significant in that Subject has judiciously blended the talents of staff. agents, career agents, contract employees, Army officers and Navy përsonnel into a cohesive, effective group which has been able to mount successful resistance, ratlino, cache, UDT, and commando operations against an insular denied area target. Subject is cost conscious and effective in the use of space, equipmont, and funds. Subject has been able to keep his agent assets in a high state of combat readiness despite shifts in policy which have placed the UDT, sabotage and commando raider operations in a high state of flux. This ability to manage agent assets under conditions of severe frustration is a tribute to Subject's area knowledge and an understanding of the psychology and mores of his agent material. Subject delegates authority and has control over the paper flow in his Branch. Subject has a fine appreciation for positive intelligence collection techniques and he has been able to rolate those techniques to his PM operations so that an intelligence product of quality has been developed on the rural areas of the target country. As a result of the totality of Subject's performance during the period covered by this report, his over-all porformance warrants an evaluation of Strong.

Subject has Spanish language fluency, operational experience, area knowledge and drive. Arzed with thoso tools, Subject is capable of meeting the long-term needs of his career service in Spanish-speaking operational areas where there is a need for first-echelon supervisors. Subject is at his best in agent handling situations and in vies of this in the future, it is believed that he should be used in Latin America under commercial cover to run and/or manago appropriate FI, CI, or PM projects.

At the completion of his current assignment, Subject should attend an advanced management course.

Amplily or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, il applicable.

Subject is a hard working, dedicated officer who has an unusual amount of drive. Subject is a distinct asset to the Station. In the period covered by this Fitness Report, Subject has worked in a persevering manner toward the goal of making the Station's Pl operations responsive to the realities of a target area which moved in twelve months tame from a soft free world operational climate to a classical hard Soviet Bloc denied area climate. Subject has had to accomplish his PM mission under th adverse circumstances of having to do a current job in response, to strong pressures for immediato production whilo simultaneously cleaning up an operational backlog which was inherited from predecessor projects. Additionally Subject had to project his PM plans into the future against a predictable operational climate in which only the most rigid application of sound PM techniques would enable the Station to continue operations against the target with either PM infiltration teams or commando raider units. Subject accomplished these multiple tasks despite the reluctance of the agent material from the target area to accept the rigid discipline and dedication which was required.

Subject was able to accomplish his PM mission by the use of sound operational concepts and principles, the delegation of authority, and the proper use of management techniques. Subject has an appreciation for intelligence and has harnessed his PM assets to provide valuable bread and butter type coverage on the rural areas of the target. (Sec continuation sheet attached)

Fitness Report Section C - NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)

Subject is at his best in agent handling situations. He uses his Spanish language fluency, experience, and area knowledge to the maximum extent possible in order to develop assets for KUBARK operational exploitation. On balance, therefore, it is believed that Subject's overall performance over the period covered by this Fitness Report warrants an evaluation of "Strong".

At the completion of his current assignment Subject might benefit from participation in an advanced management course.

In the future Subject should be used in unofficial cover positions in Latin America. Subject is a natural for this type of an assignment due to his drive, self discipline, experience, language fluency, and skin color.

## NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknessos demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestione made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Cescribe, if uppropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater to. sponsibilities. Amplify or explain, if uppropriate, ratings givan in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining futura personnel actions.

Although designated as Chief of Operations, WAVE, during the entire period that Mr has been under my supervision he has been occupied with a highly sensitive special operation controlled by Hqs, and has not been able to execute his normal duties. I have been able to closely observe his work, and can more than attest to tremendous drive and energy and this all-around professional capability, attested to in previous fitness reports. Mr. is a truly exceptional operations officer and is best utilized in that role, rather than in an administrative or supervisory capacity, although his own administrative responsibilities are always well handled. Perhaps his greatest contribution to the Station during the reporting period has boon his vast background and knowledge of the complex PBRUMEN picture which he cheerfully and unstintingly makes available to all Station officers, many of whom are without previous WHD experience.

Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Speaking operationally, Mr. Morales is a one-man gang. His work is of the highest order, quantitatively and qualitatively of the JMWAVE operation being what it is, all officers should be versatile. This Mr. Morales is. His titles -- first, Chief, CI, and more recently Chief of the combined Section -- do not even suggest the breadth of his activities. They take in denied arch intelligence collection operations, the organization, training and management of a counter-intelligence apparatus and allied groups totalling over 300 people, sabotage and resistance ops, maritime ops, political action, propaganda and a great number of miscellaneous activities that defy classification, e.g., taking over and running a fast-moving PM recruitment program without loss of tempo when politics caused the breakdown of the normal recruitment machinery, setting up a Red Cross type service for queries from the trainees in camp.

For sustained effort, Mr. Morales has few peers. With his drive, imagination and good judgment ho sets a fine example for the people who work with him, whether they find themselves under, alongside or above him in the organizational hierarchy.

His background knowledge of the area has been invaluable to the JMWAVE Station operators and his tireless efforts and willingness to devote long hours to his work have set an example which others have been compelled to follow.

3. Regardless of time in grade he is of that senior officer caliber fully deserving of and ready to assume the responsibilities of the next higher grade, has displayed outstanding porformance in FI, CI and På operations and has the potential to fill a wide variety of senior operational assignments.

4. In view of the foregoing I strongly recommend the promotion of from GS-14 to GS-15. I have discussed this action with the Chief of Station, JMWAVE, and he endorses my view that fully merits advancement to the next higher grade at this time.

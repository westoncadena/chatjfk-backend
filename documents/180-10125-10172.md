July 10, 1978

TO:
G. Robert Blakey
Chief Counsel and Director
House Select Committee on Assassinations

FROM:
Robert Morrison, Director of Security
William H. Cross, Assistant Director of Security

RE:
The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committee Offices.

About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon
returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with
Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095
noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were loose on top of
the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the
books were numbered 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages
consisting of 4 photos. 39E1 and 39E2 along with the cellophane
cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure
was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophane
enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen
revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy
Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check
by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing
or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out
since September of 1977 according to the check out log.
Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the
photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978
if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They
both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.
Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked,
but shut.

Approximately 5 P.M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request
of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the
Metropolitan Police Identification section responded to Room
3381 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints. Pvt.
Pat McGinnis, Sgt Blake and Detective Pvt McGinnis was
able to lift 13 separate cards of latent prints from the interior
of the safe, and from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was
tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday
June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross
or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times
during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned
over to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession.
The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June
23, 1978 were Edwin Lopez, Dan Hardway and Mitch Mars of the
Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA.

On Monday June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by
Pvt McGinnis were turned over to Director of Security Robert
Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #45471
in Room 3381 of Committee Office.

On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to
the FBI for certain Committee Staff member fingerprint cards.

The first request for cards was filled, and received the latter part of the week of June 25, 1978. The second request was filled and received on July 5, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty had contacted a Pvt Colon Alford of the Metropolitan Police Identification section, and requested he try to make comparisons of known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978 Pvt. Alford spent one hour in Committee spaces checking staff members prints against those lifted. On July 5, 1978 at the request of Pvt Alford, and with the consent of Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey the 13 cards of lifted prints and all staff member print cards from the FBI were turned over to Pvt Alford which he receipted for, so he could take them away from Committee spaces to enable him to spend more time studying them. During the week of July 2, 1978. Pvt Alford was able to obtain the fingerprints of Regis Blahut, an employee of the CentralIntelligence Agency. On Friday July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford phoned William H. Cross of Security Staff and stated he had made a tentative identification of Blahuts prints on the inside of the safe door, and on one of the photos in Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos. On Monday July 10, 1978 at 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford responded to the Committee offices and in the presence of Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey, Robert Morrison, and William H. Cross returned all fingerprint cards, and the 13 cards of lifted prints. These were returned to safe #45471 in Room 3381. Pvt Alford stated he had identified a certain number of points in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of Regis Blahut. These prints were matched with those on the inside of the safe door, and on the back of photo 39E2 which had been ripped from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos, and the photo which had been removed from the cellophane cover. After returning all materials Pvt Alford departed Committee Spaces at 2:55 P.M. Monday July 10, 1978.

On two occasions on this date Gary Cornwell and I spoke with Regis Blahut of the CIA. We first spoke to him at approximately 11AM in Gary Cornwell's office. We spoke with him a second time at approximately 2PM at which time we recorded his statement pertaining to a breach of security at the HSCA. The recorded statement fully covers the substance of the first conversation with two exceptions:

1) In the first conversation Regis originally told us that he looked through an autopsy photo book after receiving permission to do so. Later, during that same conversation, when asked from whom he received permission to look through the autopsy photo book he denied having said he received permission to look through the book and stated that he at no time received permission to look through the autopsy photo book. Both Gary and I distinctly recall him telling us at the outset of the conversation that he looked through the book only after receving permission to do so.

2) In the first conversation Regis told us that he was alone in the security room when he saw the book on the window sill and decided to look through it. However, when asked during the taped recorded conversation whether he was alone when he looked through the autopsy book he then stated that there were people present in the room when he looked through the autopsy book but that he cannot recall who they were. Once again, both Gary and I clearly recall him telling us when we first spoke with him that no one was present when he looked through the photo book.

RE: The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committee Offices.

About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095 noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were loose on top of the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the books were numbered 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages consisting of 4 photos. 39El and 39E2 along with the cellophane cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophane enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out since September of 1977 according to the check out log.

Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978 if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently. Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked, but shut.

II. Summary of Contact:

On this date Gary Cornwell and myself spoke with Regis
Blahut in Gary's office. Mr. Blahut stated the following:

1) He lied to us in our conversation of July 13 when he
stated that on the second occasion he looked through the
black looselead binder, he put it back on the window sill
after reading it. He told us that the truth was that while
he was looking through the book it dropped on the floor. He
stated that when it dropped on the floor some of the pages
came out of the book. He became frightened that someone
would enter the room at this time so he opened the black
safe which contained the autopsy books and placed the black
looseleaf binder and the pages which had fallen out, into the
top part of the safe. Prior to him opening it to put in the
book, the safe door had been completely closed (i.e. not
ajar), although it was not locked. He said he opened it by
pressing down on the handle and pulling the door open. He
stated that he did not recall whether the top part of the safe

had a shelf or a drawer in it. He also stated that at this time he did not observe any of the photos to be out of the plastic sheeting which ordinarily held them in the black binder. Mr. Blahut denied however that he opened the safe at any time other than when he put the book inside.

2) He stated to us that the first time he had looked through the book --the time when Jim Conzelman took it out of the safe-- he slid one of the photos partly out of the plastic to look at it. To the best of his recollection this photo was either a photo of the brain or a photo of the bust of Kennedy. He stated this was the only time that he had observed any of the photos to be out of their plastic sheeting.

3.) He stated that he did not wish to allow us to make a tape recording of this statement.

II. Summary of Contact:

Bob Blakey and I met with DCI Turner, DDCI Carlucci and Fred Hitz of the Office of Legislative Counsel at 8:00 A.M. in Turner's office. Blakey initially noted that he had come at Chairman Stokes' request to discuss with Turner a recent security violation which had been discovered by the Committee.

Blakey began by describing to Turner the nature of the Kennedy autopsy pictures, the restrictions under which the Committee has acquired and possessed them, the security precautions (separate safe, limited access, and log record) utilized to safeguard them, and the possible motives that might exist for someone unlawfully removing them from the Committee.

Blakey next described the circumstances and details of the Committee's discovery, made on 6/23/78, that the autopsy

photos had been tampered with, and the investigation which
the staff thereafter conducted, including the identification
of all of those persons who had access to the security space
where they were located, the fingerprinting process and
results, and ultimately the questioning of Regis Blahut,
the CIA employee who was in the security space on that date.
Finally, Blakey recalled to Turner his (Turner's)
statement made to Blakey and Cornwell on February 4, 1978,
to the effect that if the Committee found any impropriety
or wrongdoing on the part of any CIA employee, he would
personally look into and get to the bottom of it. Blakey
stated that the Chairman had been told of Turner's comment
on February 4, 1978, and now requested that Turner conduct
a further investigation of the Blahut matter. Blakey stated
that the Committee felt such an investigation was necessary
for the following reasons:

1.  The Committee had spoken to Blahut on three
    occasions (July 11, 13 and 14) about his knowledge
    of the tampering with the autopsy photos, on two
    of which, by Blahut's own subsequent admissions,
    he had lied about significant details, and on
    the last of which, by independent evidence, Blahut
    had also lied;

2.  Blahut's actions were deliberate, as evidenced

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

Admiral Stansfield Turner OCR                                                 Page three

by the fact that Blahut had opened the Committee's
safe in which the photos were stored, and on the
first two interviews with the Committee, he lied
about having done so;

3. There is only one possible innocent motive for
   Blahut's handling and viewing of the autopsy photos,
   that being personal curiosity, and the evidence
   unequivocally shows that personal curiosity was not
   the motive (a page was ripped out, a photo was re-
   moved from the plastic sheeting, the log shows that
   the photo book in question had not been removed from
   the safe by the Committee staff since September, 1977,
   and Blahut's story about his handling of, and access
   to that photo book on June 23, 1978 is patently un-
   believable); and most significantly,

4. Prior to *at least* two of the three occasions
   on which Blahut was interviewed by the Committee
   staff, he spoke to his superiors at the Agency, and
   after each of those conversations he told lies to
   the Committee about his involvement.

Turner said that he had already looked into the matter,
and handed us a report which had been written. Turner sug-
gested that Blakey and Cornwell go read the report (not take
a copy with them from the building), and also look at Blahut's

personnel file, and then let the Agency know what else he
(Blakey) suggested they should do.

Upon inspection, the report reflected the following:

(a.) The Agency interviewed Blahut on Friday evening,
July 14, and polygraphed him three times for roughly
two hours each time on Saturday, July 15;

(b.) Blahut's supervisors had been spoken to, and
denied any involvement;

(c.) Blahut admitted lying to the Committee;

(d.) Blahut basically told the same story to the
polygraph expert (Felippo) he had finally told the
Committee on the morning of July 14, except that
on July 15 he admitted that he was never given
permission by any Committee staff member to view
the Kennedy autopsy pictures;

(e.) Blahut persisted in his story (but lied in
doing so, according to the polygraph) that he had
opened the Committee safe only once, and that was
to put a photo book into the safe, and also (again,
untruthfully) stated that he had only viewed the
autopsy books on two occasions.

(f.) Blahut has been assigned to a CIA operation
code named MHCHILD since April, 1977. *

Office of Security Chief Gambino, and Carlucci's as-
sistant, Hav Smith, met with Blakey and Cornwell after they

had reviewed the investigative report provided by Turner. Blakey requested that he be permitted to see Blahut's security file. Gambino refused, but offered the personnel file instead.

The personnel file reflected that Blahut had consistently received excellent ratings from his superiors, that he showed leadership qualities in his work, and that he had been commended for consistently reporting to his superiors what he had observed and done during his assignments, and alerting them to any problems he encountered.*

Finally, Smith and Gambino asked Blakey what he felt the Agency should do now. Blakey said that full interviews of all of Blahut's supervisors should be conducted, and written reports made. In addition, Blakey stated that new polygraphs should be taken, focusing primarily on the area that was essentially omitted on July 15, namely, the question of motive.

Hav Smith asked whether the Committee was going to accept the Agency's investigation after it was completed; he said he wanted to know now, that he wanted a commitment. Smith said that he was 99 percent sure that the final report would show no involvement in the tampering on the part of the Agency. Gambino said, "We know we're clean." In reply, I asked how the Agency could be so sure at this early point that none of their employees except Blahut were involved, and I also commented that Smith was asking the Committee to "buy a pig in a poke" in suggesting that we should tell him now whether or not we would be satisfied with the Agency's investigation

before it was even conducted. Both Blakey and I stated that what we *could* now state was that we had come to the Agency with the suggestion that they investigate it, because we felt that from among the alternatives now available to the Committee, that alternative was the one with the best chance of success. Finally Blakey also noted that his hope was that after the Agency's investigation was complete, copies of the reports could be placed in the Agency's and the Committee's files, and that would be the end of it.

The meeting was terminated with the general understanding that Blakey's suggestions would be followed, and the Agency would let us know when they had their reports complete.

The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe # 102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committer offices.

About 4:05 P.M. June 23, 1978 Mark Flanagan upon returning
some autopsy material to the Security room along with Lance Svendson
of Security staff upon opening safe #102095 noted that several autopsy
photos were lying loosely on top of the other books. The photos
removed were 39E1, 39E2, 40 E and 41 E. This was two pages consisting
of 4 photos. Photos 39 El and 39E2 had been ripped from the book.
One photo 39E2 was out of the cellophane enclosure and laying loose.
A quick check showed that these photos were from Book Five, Part One.
An immediate check of all books was begun by Flanagan and Svendsen
to ascertain if any other photos might be missing. No other photos
were found to be missing or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had
not been signed out recently according to the check out log.
Both Mark Flanagan and Lance Svendsen stated they would have noticed
the photos when the safe was open at 10 AM June 23, 1978 if they
had been lying were they were. They both feel there is no way this
could have been done accidently. Someone had to enter safe and do
this. The safe was unlocked but shut.

Aprroximately 5 P.M. June 23, 1978 at the request of Committee
Investigator Jack Moriarty three members of the Metropolitan Police
Identification section responded to Room 3381 for the purpose of
attempting to get latent prints. Pvt Pat McGinniss, Sgt Blake and
Det. Pvt. McGinniss was able to lift 13 separate cards of
latent prints from the interior of the safe, and from the Kennedy photos book that was tampered with. These men left at approximately
8:35 PM June 23, 1978. Investigator Moriarty, William H. Cross or
G. Robert Blakey were present at all times during the lifting of the
prints. The lifted prints were turned over toInvestigator Moriarty,
and remained in his possession.

The persons who were in this office on June 23, 1978 other than
Security personnel wereEdwin Lopez, Dan Hardway, Mitch Mars, and
Regis Blahut of the CIA.

On June 27, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to the FBI for
certain staff members print cards. The first were recieved the week
of June 26, 1978, and the second packet on July 5, 1978. Investigator
Moriarty had contacted a Pvt. Colon Alford of the Metropolitan Police
Department ID section and requested he try to make comparisons of
known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978 Pvt Alford
spent one hour in Committee office checking staff members prints
gainst those lifted. On July 6, 1978 the latent prints and all

Committee spaces so he could spen more time studing them. During
the week of July 2, 1978 Pvt. Alford was able to obtain the
fingerprint card of Regis Blahut (a Former D.C. Fireman) On Friday
July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford contacted William
Cross of Security staff and stated he had made a tentative identifi-
cation of Blahuts prints on the safe door and one of the photos in
Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autposy photos. On Monday July
10, 1978 at 2:30 PM Pvt Alford responded to the Committee offices
and in the presence of G. Robert Blakey, Robert Morrison and
William H. Cross returned all fingerprint cards, The 13 cards
of lifted prints, and stated he had identified a certain number of
points in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of
Regis Blahut. These prints were on the inside of the safe door and
on photo 39E2 which had been ripped from Book Five Part One, and
had been removed from the cellophane cover. After returning all

Mr Blakey was notofied at 5:05 PM after he completed a meeting in his office. He stated that from now on the JFK safe will be locked at all times. If something is taken out the safe will be relocked until it is returned.

I suggest that until such time as the persons using that room are finished in there we should lock all the safes at all times

July 10, 1978

TO:

G. Robert Blakey
Chief Counsel and Director
House Select Committee on Assassinations

FROM:

Robert Morrison, Director of Security
William H. Cross, Assistant Director of Security

RE:

The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committee Offices.

About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095 noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were loose on top of the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the books were numbered 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages consisting of 4 photos. 39El and 39E2 along with the cellophane cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophan enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out since September of 1977 according to the check out log. Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978 if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently. Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked, but shut.

Approximately 5 P.M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the section responded to Room 3381 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints. Iwas able to lift 13 separate cards of latent prints from the interior of the safe, and from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned over to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June 23, 1978 were Edwin Lopez, Dan Hardway and Mitch Mars of the Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA.

On Monday June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by Pvt McGinnis were turned over to Director of Security Robert Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #45471 in Room 3381 of Committee Office.

On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to the FBI for certain Committee Staff member fingerprint cards.

NW 88326 Docld:32269709 Page 134


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

The first request for cards was filled, and received the latter part of the week of June 25, 1978. The second request was filled and received on July 5, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty had contacted a section, and requested he try to make comparisons of known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978 spent one hour in Committee spaces checking staff members prints against those lifted. On July 5, 1978 at the request of and with the consent of Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey the 13 cards of lifted prints and all staff member print cards from the FBI were turned over to which he receipted for, so he could take them away from Committee spaces to enable him to spend more time studying them. During the week of July 2, 1978 was able to obtain the fingerprints of Regis Blahut, an employee of the CentralIntelligence Agency. On Friday July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. phoned William H. Cross of Security Staff and stated he had made a tentative identification of Blahuts prints on the inside of the safe door, and on one of the photos in Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos. On Monday July 10, 1978 at 2:30 P.M responded to the Committee offices and in the presence of Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey, Robert Morrison, and William H. Cross returned all fingerprint cards, and the 13 cards of lifted prints. These were returned to safe #45471 in Room 3381. stated he had identified a certain number of points in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of Regis Blahut. These prints were matched with those on the inside of the safe door, and on the back of photo 39E2 which had been ripped from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos, and the photo which had been removed from the cellophane cover. After returning all materials departed Committee Spaces at 2:55 P.M. Monday July 10, 1978.

# MEMORANDUM TO: WH/C/OPS

# SUBJECT: Call from Mr. Dick Philips (State) Regarding the Arrest of AMLEO-3

1. Mr. Dick Philips said that he received a call from Mitchell L. WER-BELL about the arrest of AMLEO-3. The following information is contained in CIA files regarding Mr. WER-BELL:

> "Subject was born March 1918, in Philadelphia. He served in the OSS during World War II and later opened a public relations and advertising firm in Atlanta. During the past three years he has entered various import/export ventures in Latin America and Florida. He was in the Dominican Republic during the past summer. He is well-known to this Agency and is categorized as unscrupulous and a promoter with grandiose schemes. Although he has offered to work for us, he has never been used. He claims close friendship with many Latin American political and military figures."

2. The three Cubans that WER-BELL reported arrested are Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez (AMLEO-3), Gilberto Fondora and Miguel Ramos. These men were crew members of the JURE mother vessel VENUS. From JMWAVE reports it appears that AMLEO-3 was attempting to exfiltrate his family, using the VENUS, when he was caught by Cuban security forces on 3 September 1965.

# OCCURRENCE:

In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem and that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid. (as proposed in a paper prepared by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the PresidentSOURCEould be well informed of any steps taken in this contexT AF Fsuch as the instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week

OCCURRENCE:
In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam on October 29, 1963 with MCCONE, HELMS, AND COLBY in attendance. The following record by HELMS and COLBY shows that: it was suggested that in the Ambassador's absence, HARKINS, TRUEHART, and DAVID SMITH act as a committee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE countered with the view that SMITH should not be involved in such a-policy-making function, although he would be in a position-to- provide technical advise to HARKINS and TRUEHART as well as carry out their instructions in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy ev idence. The DCI stated his view that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might only be solved by a second or third coup.

The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of July.

OCCURRENCE:
Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE's suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to the_U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He mentioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures by the introduction of biological agents which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could SOURCE:be completely covered up.

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30,
1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations
/Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5419 Augmented
by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for
providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress."
(00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection
upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.
The plan itself at pages 00183 through 00187 included establishing intelligence agents
inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting
ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military
installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government
organizations or to defect officials "in place" and negotiating for British help in
contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. The British want to
know, how serious are you before risking their assets to help the US.. (00180-00187)

meeting of foreign ministers which opened January 22, 1962. The object was to get wide Western Hemisphere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it from the rest of the hemisphere. "The OAS meeting is to be supported by public demonstrations in Latin America, generated by CIA and a psychological campaign assisted by USIA." The major task of the diplomatic capability was to encourage Latin American leaders to develop independent operations similar to the instant project seeking an internal revolt of the Cuban people against the Communist regime. In the economic warfare area an embargo on Cuban trade was to be considered after the OAS meeting. The CIA was unable to undertake the action to sabotage the sugar harvest which commences about January 15 and upon which Cuba's one-crop economy depended. Sabotage of transport, mills, sugar sacking in cane fields was explored, according to Lansdale's review. Special sabotage support was noted.→

"CIA has initiated action to contaminate POL supplies for Cuba, although visible results
(stopage of some Cuban transports) is not expected until mid-1962. CIA is introducing Lubzol, a corrosive additive to Cuban locomotive diesel fuel oil through commercial suppliers in Beligium. A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.
Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate-which-will-permit-provocative actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks are for each of the entitities involved then follows in Lansdale's memo. The memorandum notes that the President directed that the Chief of Operations conduct the project through the appropriate organizations and departments of the government. In this regard the memo notes "Also, CIA apparently believes that its role should be to create and expand a popular

In regard to Task #7 of General Lansdale's review this memo notes, "Moreover, the development of a resisitence movement will not remain controllable, so that operational time tables produced during the next four weeks can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of actions." (00107)

The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for inside Cuba -have-been-assessed-in-depth. Fifteen locations have been selected as suitable centers for resistence. It was also noted that in support of State's efforts, CIA has conducted propaganda operations including a number of mass demonstrations in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela..

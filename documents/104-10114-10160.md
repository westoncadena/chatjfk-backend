104-10114-10160 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

3/8/61

To: Mr. Jack Kennedy
WH/L/Security

Mr. Kennedy,
Several months ago I wrote you a letter concerning the Pro-Castro centi-
mants of Court Wood, son of Foster Wood, a local attorney. Since that time I've
seen Court only once, on March 3,1961, and he appears to be actively engaged
in the organisation of a local chapter of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE.
Complete with beard, Court has been meeting with"interested groups"and lect-
uring to students in sever eastern cities. He specifically mentioned Palinore,
Philadelphia, and New York. Apparently there are a number of students envolv -
ed in this activity; I met David Lacterman from George Mason High School in
Falls Church, Va.end Walt MacDonwald, a fellos student of Courts, and both
are obviously active.

What action, if any, should I take in regard to my relationship with
Court and his father?

Please include this statement in my permanent record.

THANK YOU

Michael Stratton
WH/L/Reg.
Ex. 2929

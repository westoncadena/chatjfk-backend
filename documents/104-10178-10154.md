PBRUMEN/AMCLEVE-15- Report from Cuban Exile

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

See below.

1. Forwarded herewith for your information is a report furnished by AMCLEVE-15 on 26 June 1968. AMCLEVE-15 received the information from Jorge MAS Canosa, who got it from Johnny 00201 Alvart, who recently arrived in Niemi from Cuba.

2. The report names Jorge Horate as a Cuban lieutenant who studied rocketry in the USSR for three years. It states that Norate is disaffected with the Castro regime and sells *things on the black market that the Russians bring into Cuba.
   The report also mertions that "Il Gallego" Fernandez, chief of a squadron of MIG's at the Olguin Air Base, is also disaffected with the Castro government and used to give Alvart information about the base. Fernandez told him that, in April 1968 there were severe fuel restrictions on the air base which limited the MIG flights.

3. JMWAVE may wish to contact Alvart if it has not already done so.

TO : WH/COG 7 June 1968

FROM : Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT: AMCLEVE/15 -- IDEN A IRD #72501
201-300985

BACKGROUND:

Subject is a 40-year-old PBRUMEN male who has been of continuing WOFIRM interest since initial contact with JMWAVE and more recently with the Caracas Station as a penetration of the IDEN B organization.

PURPOSE/PROCEDURE:

Subject was SGSWIR Led at the request of the Caracas Station because of several issues which tended to question Subject's bona fides, possible affiliation with PBRUMEN intelligence through relatives, unreported associ-ation with gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM, plus other items specified in questions listed below. The interview was conducted in the home of Oscar C. KALBING in both English and Spanish. (Subject's English is quite good, however, during actual testing Spanish was used to avoid ambiguity or misunderstanding of the question content.) KALBING did the translating.

RESULTS:

Subject remains sensitive to one question which is related to his past dealings with IDEN C but in fairness to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine uncertainity over the amount of items which he had been instrumental in getting for IDEN C. Sensitivity initially recorded in other areas was rescived through post-test discussion and responses to all other questions are regarded as substantially truthful. Subject was most cooperative and candid throughout the entire interview.

DETAILS:

Because of the numerous issues which were believed in need of clarifi-cation, a three phase test was structured prior to the interview and rehearsed with Subject completely before any testing took place. Discussions, as noted, were in both English and Spanish. Specific questions asked of Subject and answers given by him are as follows:

SECRET

CS-COPY

201-300985


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

Page 2
IRD $72501

Have you used any name besides IDEN A? Answer: No, except
for nicknames and aliases used with WOFIRM.

Have you ever travelled to Washington, D. C.? Answer: Yes.
Once several years ago.

Have you ever been to the Soviet Union? Answer: No.

Are any of your relatives members of the Communist Party?
After some discussion Subject felt it probable that they were.
Those specifically mentioned were his two brothers IDEN D
and IDEN E and also possibly a sister named IDEN F who is
also in PBRUMEN and married to a Captain in the Militia.
When the question was prefaced with the words: "Is it your
belief that any of your relatives are members, " Subject's
answer was always yes. He based this belief on the fact that
both brothers hold highly responsible positions in key industries
in PBRUMEN and hence must be members. He also noted that
prior to his leaving PBRUMEN, he (Subject) and his two brothers
had many discussions about politics and their views differed
from Subject's. As for his brother IDEN E, Subject regarded
him as the "brain" in the family and originally a very religious
person who attended Catholic services daily. He later evinced
distrust for the clergy in PBRUMEN and blamed them for the
downfall of the church. When Castro made his move, IDEN E
was in complete sympathy with him and remained with him
despite his apparent conversiou to Communism, although
IDEN E never acknowledged that he had been a Communist and
would usually retort with a comment that he (IDEN E) was a
"humanist."

Are any of your relatives working for PBRUMEN Intelligence?
His answer was that he felt that at least one of them was accord-
ing to what KALBING inferred during his discussion with Subject
the day before the SGSWIRL test. This was his brother IDEN D,
but he also wondered about his brother IDEN E who might also be
with PBRUMEN intelligence because according to what his mother
mentioned in a letter some time ago, IDEN E had been in the
USSR receiving training of some sort. This training lasted for
a full year and occurred in 1962 to the best of Subject's memory.
Subject was reasonably sure of this date because of the "Atissile
crisis" and President Kennedy's death which occurred later.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

IRD #72501

After this discussion the question read: "Is it probable that your relatives (brothers) are working for PBRUMEN Intelligence? Answer: Yes."

Did you know your brother (IDEN D) was working with IDEN G before we told you? Answer: No. But again had some suspicions.

Besides the letters we asked you to send to your brothers have you communicated with anyone in PBRUMEN? Answer: Yes. His mother about two or three times a year and with an aunt named IDEN H which was the person to whom he actually addressed the letter to his brother which WOFIRM asked him to write. This letter incidentally was posted in 1967 (a fow months before coming to Caracas) and not 1966 as noted in Station files. Since arrival in Caracas, Subject has written his mother only once and had the letter posted from Miami to prevent anyone knowing his exact whereabouts. (In addition to these contacts, Subject has sent one telegram to his mother soon after the IDEN I just to let her know he was alright.) It was about this time that IDEN E wrote to him and criticized his participation in IDEN 1.

Have you seen either of your brothers since 1961? Subject answered no. Last saw IDEN E at the airport in the distance but there were employees from IDEN E's place of employment present and IDEN E was apparently reluctant to go near the plane. Since 1961 Subject has not seen any member of his family and as time goes on dues not miss them as much. The persons he claims to have been closest to were his aunt and grandmother and addresses comments to them personally when he does write to his mother. When further discussing his brothers on this question, Subject was somewhat complimentary despite their differing political views and generally considered them as hard-working energetic types with good school records.

Do you have a secret means of contacting anyone in PBRUMEN? Claims he knows of friends who have used telegrams to transmit coded messages but he has never engaged in such activity. These messages were directed against the PBRUMEN.

IRD #72501

Have you ever been in Communist China? Answer: No.

Have you ever worked for the intelligence service of any country besides IDEN J and LNILARP? Answer: No.

Have you ever received intelligence training in PBRUMEN? Answer: No.

Have you over been a member of any Communist guerrilla group? Answer: No. Later explained sensitivity to the question as emanating from current work with two former Communist guerrillas named IDEN K and IDEN L both of whom are now with IDEN B.

Have you told anyone in PBRUMEN that you are working with WOFIRM? Answer: No. This question led to a discussion of broadcasts from PBRUMEN which identified Subject as a member of WOFIRM. These broadcasts occurred in October 1967 according to Subject and the man fingering him was IDEN M. The latter was not officially in Subject's WOFIRM group before his capture in FBRUMEN hence Subject does not know why it was that he was specifically named. When it was later suggested that this announcement would probably have ecme effect on his family, Subject said he just didn't know what effect it would have and has heard of none. He agreed that it was quite ironic that one side of the family was working with an intelligence service which was diametrically opposed to the side to which another member of the same family was affiliated and in fact because of his present IDEN B employment he was actually in the business of hunting them down. Subject agreed that it was indeed ironic but felt his convictions differed from his brothers' and that was that.

Have you told anyone in IDEN N that you are working for WOFIRM? Noted that some knew of his past affiliatica hence the question was qualified to mean his present affiliation. Later after reactions were recorded, Subject noted that his wife is fully witting of his WOFIRM employment as is IDEN O. He also mentioned that a PBRUMEN type, IDEN P. whom he knows from childhood has been kidding him constantly in Caracaa

that he is still with WOFIRM until Subject finally told him in an offhand way, "Sare I'm with WOFIRM," but he does not know what effect this had on IDEN P or whether he has told anyone of his suspicions of Subject's WOFIRM Involvement. He specifically denied that anyone other than these three persons were knowledgeable.

Does anyone in IDEN B know you have this meeting with us today?
Answer: No.

Have you ever been asked to perform any task or mission against the LNHARP? Answer: No.

Have you over performed any task or mission on behalf of IDEN G?
Answer: No.

Has anyone told or instructed you on what to report to us? Answer: No.

Have you had contact with IDEN C since 1967? Answer: No. Continued reactions to this question which necessitated a break- down test to isolate the reason for his sensitivity to the topic. He repeatedly denled that he had had any contact with IDEN C since the IDEN Q told him not to but acknowledged a physical revulsion to the mention of the man's naine, and a long dis- cussion ensued regarding the extent of Subject's involvement with the man. Subject contended that the contact began quite Innocently in 1965 and was what Subject initially thought was a deliberate provocation to see what Subject's reaction would be. Subject immediately reported the contact to JMWAVE handlers who guided him through continued contacts and instructions from IDEN Q. Subject was instructed to sell IDEN C "silencers" (guns with silencers attached--about six or seven to the best of his recollection) in order to find out his true identity. Subject fur- nished physical descriptions and license numbers to JMWAVE and continued to report on contact with IDEN C. He offered Subject $500 US which JMWAVE told Subject to keep since it was merely a bonus given him for his work as an intermediary. IDEN C continued to force contact with Subject and once came to his home in shorts and made veiled threats which were answered with counter threats of violence from Subject, and an outright threat that Subject would kill IDEN C if he threatened

him again. In 1967 while with the IDEN R, Subject gave IDEN C some "pencils' to keep him away which Subject did not then report to WOFIRM but later did. He gave him about 120 altogether. Subject had promised IDEN C some 500 pounds of C/4 explosives, M-2's, sub-machine guns, etc. but all was intended to bait IDEN C for arrest and none was over supplied to him. Later Subject noted after reacting to a break-down question that he had supplied him with pencils, silencers, and also some grenades and pentolite. But these he claims should be a matter of record with JMWAVE. The grenades were typical military type and numbered about 24 to 48 altogether. Again, however, Subject noted that he acted only as intermediary between IDEN C and another individual who is now deceased in PBRUMEN and did not physically handle any muritions shipments. As noted above, continued sensitivity to the question of the amounts or types of equipment furnished IDEN C is believed attributable to uncertainty of Subject's part as to exactly what he did arrange for shipment to IDEN C. As to the basic question about contact with him since 1967 (or when he was told by IDEN Q to no longer have contact with IDEN C), Subject insisted that he never re- established contact of any kind but always checks at IDEN S to determine if IDEN C is around.

Do you now have in your possession any arms, munitions or articles of demolition which was once the property of the LNHARP? Only those items which were discussed during a pre-test debriefing, vis., items brought to Caracas by him in a suitcase and consist- ing of the following: 3 or 4 smoke grenades; 6 or 7 booby traps (army type); 1 piece of delay fuse about 100 feet long; ore primer cord about 100 feet; 2 or 3 MK2 grenades; about 10 pencils (some regular open market supply items and some of the "company" variety); demolition pliers; knife; compass; metascope (infra- viewer worth about $50 used). These items he said were taken while with the IDEN R and with the knowledge of IDEN T although IDEN T did not know exactly what he had taken. Subject was using these items frequently in training courses and they were not to the best of Subject's knowledge the property of LNHARP at that time although it is possible that some of these items were at one time LNHARP and possibly WOFIRM items. But he explained further that these items are plentiful in the Miami area and can


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

Page 7
IRD 072501

easily be obtained through gun dealers. During a later conversation Subject noted that he has heard of many places where munitions could be obtained very easily especially in New Jersey, in California and in Miami, but he denied being personally involved in any such dealings.

Have you ever stolen equipment of any type from WOFIRM? Answer: Yes. About 5 gallons of gas once from a launch boat. Other than this, nothing.

Do you know the identities of persons who stole arms and equipment from LNHARP? Answer: No.

Break-down questions dealing with IDEN C:

Did you have contact with IDEN C from 1965 through 1967? Answer: Yes.

During this time did he give you $500 for equipment which he wanted? Answer: Yos.

Did you receive more than $500 from him? Answer: No.

Is it correct that you received threats from him? Answer: Yes.

Besides the pencils, silencers, grenades and pentolite did you give him any other items? Answer: No. (as noted continued sensitivity which is unexplained except in the examiner's conclusion)

Did IDEN Q tell you to stop contacting him in October or November 1967? Answer: Yes.

Did you contact IDEN C after November 1967? Answer: No. (Slight sensitivity but explained as relating to constant checking on his whereabouts to avoid contact.)

Has your employer contacted him since November 1967? Answer: No, not to his knowledge. On this question Subject noted that his employer can easily obtain guns and supplies from European

IRD #72501

sources cheaper than LNHARP. Also Subject noted that the few guns (small calibre snub nose weapons) which he has brought to Caracas with him from Miami are merely for the personal use of some of his fellow employees in IDEN B, and he breaks no laws in bringing them with him on the few trips he has made between 1967 and the present. He feels he has perhaps brought a total of 6 such small sidearms to Caracas and also one sport rifle (AR-15) which he was asked to bring back by IDEN U. The rifle was a gift to IDEN U. The weapon was not automatic per Subject.

The only other items which Subject could think of which could link WOFIRM with his organization are the silencers which he reported on in Miami some months back which his organization took from captured guerrillas and which were probably issued to a group which went to PBRUMEN and were lost. Subject is positive they were WOFIRM issue but purportedly the serial numbers which he submitted could not be checked.

One additional item which was cleared up dealt with the pentolite which had been reported seen in Caracas. Subject voluntarily mentioned that he had seen such a supply under the bed of a friend. The supply was attached to magnets which were to be used to attach the charge to the underside of a ship in Caribbean waters of IDEN V or IDEN W nationality. The charge was to discourage further shipments between these latter IDENs and PBRUMEN. Subject said he detached the magnets from the pentolite and intended using it in training classes for students with his present employer. The person who brought it to Caracas was IDEN X. Subject does not know how he got it here, but knows that his employer could facilitate such deliveries.

# SECRET

Dear friend Palo,

This is the third letter that I am sending you. Since I am sending this letter by messenger, I can explain more.

The Government here assisted a group of Cubans called the Brigade. The Department of Defense (Army) provided this assistance without consulting the Ministry of the Interior. When the Minister of the Interior found out, he demanded an explanation from the military men and they stopped the assistance.

There are strong possibilities that a plan will be developed for Cuba, which will involve the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior and which will be assigned to a group of serious persons.

I believe it is highly important that I go to Miami urgently or that some of you come here. This is urgent.

If you want me to go, send my fare to this address:

San Juan Bosco Avenue

Mayflower Bldg. Apt 24

Altamira, Caracas Venezuela

On the other hand, ERASTO FERNANDEZ is being summoned by Congress. He is accused of being too severe with the Communists. Send a telegram as soon as possible, expressing solidarity with his attitude, in the name of the Cubans in EECE. If possible, mention me in the telegram.

The address is: Police Headquarters

Las Colinas Av, las Bribas Bldg

Los Chaquararos, Caracas, Venezuela

Some organization (I do not know the name) has already sent telegrams. KRASTO can be of great assistance to us.

When you send the telegram, do not mention me by name. Word it something like this "Greetings from our fellow countryman, who is fighting beside us" or words to that effect.

My telephone is 321506

Regards to all your friends.

SUMMARY: AN INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION BY THE

DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF POLICE (DIGEPCL) ON CUBAN EXILE

FLANS TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK ON CUSA HAS REVEALED THAT

MEMBERS OF THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY, WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED. THE

VENEZUELANS HAVE FROCURED ARMS FOR THE PLOTTERS AND HAVE

HELPED THEM SRING IN ARMS BY BOAT. THE PLANNED ATTACK HAS

BEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE DIGEPOL'S INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED

DETAILS OF THE OPERATION. HOWEVER, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE

INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO INTEREST ITSELF IN AIDING CUBAN

EXILE PLANS. END SUMMARY.

1. IN FEBRUARY 1968, THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF POLICE

(DIGEPCL) BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS THAT VENEZUELANS

WERE PROCUR ING ARMS FOR A CUBAN EXILE GROUP IN VENEZUELA

WHICH PLANNED TO ATTACK CUBA. INITIAL REPORTS IDENTIFIED

TWO CUBANS INVOLVED IN THE CASE: SALVADOR ROMANI-ORUE-GARCIA, WHO

ARRIVED IN VENEZUELA AS AN EXILE FROM CUBA IN 1959, AND

REINALDO BONIFACIO GONZALEZ-LEON GARCIA, WHO IS A CLOSE

2. BY APRIL 1968 DIGEPOL'S INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION HAD IDENTIFIED NINE MORE CUBAN PARTICIPANTS AND HAD REVEALED THAT TWO UNIDENTIFIED MEMBERS OF THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY, AN ARMY COLONEL AND A MAJOR, WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE PLAN. THE TWO VENEZUELANS HAD PROCURED ARMS FOR THE GROUP AND HAD ALSO HELPED TO ARRANGE THE ARRIVAL IN VENEZUELA IN EARLY 1968 OF TWO BOATS CARRYING ARMS. THE BOATS WERE DOCKED AT CLUB PUERTO AZUL AND AT PUERTO CABELLO.

3. UPON LEARNING THAT THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY WAS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE PLAN AND THAT THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE RAMON FLORENCIO GOMEZ KNEW THAT VENEZUELAN MILITARY AID WAS BEING GIVEN TO THE CUBAN PLOTTERS, THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR CONFRONTED THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE ON 23 APRIL WITH THE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE COLLECTED ON THE CASE. THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE ADMITTED ITS INVOLVEMENT.

Guerrilla Course in Cuba

REFERENCES: A. OBMA-23303, 7 December 1967
B. UFOA-29461, 8 February 1968

1.  Forwarded herewith are copies of seven folders which comprise the notes taken by Mario Cannella at a guerrilla course he attended in Cuba from December 1966 through October 1967. Copies of these notes were received from unilateral penetration agent of CIRAGH, ARCIVE-15.

2.  The course was particularly heavy on explosives, with the first three volumes being devoted to it exclusively. Volumes 4 and 6 are also mostly on explosives, with the first part of each being on photography and Marxism, respectively. Volumes 5 and 7 deal with such subjects as tradecraft, infiltration-exfiltration operations, security, safehouses, recruitments, sabotage operations, etc.

3.  No copies of the attachments are being sent to JMWAVE; we defer to Headquarters as to whether it would be worthwhile to reprint some of the courses for distribution to JMWAVE or others.

Chief of Station, Caracas

Venezuelan Security Services Technical Capabilities

REFERENCE: HVCS-2610

AMCLEVE-15

1. Headquarters' request to review the contents of the attachment to Reference was received at a time when the Station was unable to produce current data to make a meaningful contribution to updating subject matter. Since receipt of Reference, the Station has unilaterally recruited a telephone technician who is knowledgeable of SIFA telephone tape. This subject has not been used as yet, nor has he received his first months salary and RECOVER is not yet prepared to probe Subject on SIFA tape. With regard to DIGIPOL technical operations, the Station has only recently been able to obtain unilateral type information through ANCLEVE-15 who is only now getting to know the man in charge of the DIGIPOL telephone operation.

2. Within the next two months the Station should be in a position to provide a more detailed and specific report on GOV technical operations.

3. The following is all the information currently available to the Station on SIFA/DIGEPOL technical operations.

a. SIFA telephone tape are monitored in the building housing the Ministry of Communications, which is located alongside SIFA headquarters. According to the telephone technician, they have a capability to intercept 50 lines, but only a dozen are in operation at any given time. The monitoring section consists of 2-3 persons. Because of this personnel shortage many tapes are not replayed and even less are transcribed. SIFA offices in the interior have been reduced and it is doubtful that a telephone program is in operation.

b. The DIGEPOL telephone intercepts are now directly under command of the Minister of Interior and all intercept requests must have his approval. According to CIGIRO-1 in conversations with the 003, the former claims a telephone capability of 50 lines, not including 3-4 lines he has running directly into his office. (Plans call for completion of an additional 100 lines by the end of February 1968.) These are monitored in the building of Ministry of Interior. The staffing pattern, production and utilisation of the take is unknown to the Station. Since a capability of this extent involves running a cable to the monitoring post, it is most probable that the actual taps are on the frame at the main telephone exchange in Caracas.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH SECRET BVCA-108

e. The Station is unaware of any capability of the GOV may have to place transmitters in telephones and it is doubtful that they have considered this type of operation during the past year.

d. A recent development, too early for the Station to report on as yet, is the formation of a Special Group under CIVISTA-5. It is known that CIVISTA-5 has been in the throes of developing a clandestine unit to run true intelligence type operations. In keeping with his plans he ordered a large amount of technical equipment from Germany. This equipment arrived on 14 February with one of his agents who had been receiving intelligence training in Germany. As yet the equipment has not been unpacked, but it is believed to contain material more of a photographic nature rather than audio type material. It is believed that CIVISTA-5 has also placed an order for audio equipment with a firm in the United States.

4. As can be seen from the above, the best GOV capability is to be found in the telephone intercept program, and as has been indicated, the Station will have much better information on this and other technical operations within the next few months.

ANCLEVE-15

REFERENCES: A. HVCA-14975
B. HVCA-15159

1. CIRASH-15 reported that ANCLEVE-15, shortly after the latter's return from Miami on 30 January 1968, asked CIRASH-15 if he could obtain curare poison for "approximately forty hypodermic needles." ANCLEVE-15 said that the request had been made by Gustavo CATII Paez, who was still in Miami at that time. CATII returned to Caracas during the second week of February, and on 15 February he personally contacted CIRASH-15 and reiterated the request. CIRASH-15 has so far been unable to determine for what purpose CATII wants the curare.

2. We have not heard anything about this from ANCLEVE-15 and will not ask him in order not to expose CIRASH-15. This is possibly another one of the goon squad activities tentatively planned for Caracas mentioned in Reference A, but more likely it has to do with some wild Cuban exile scheme in Miami, since ANCLEVE-15 told CIRASH-15 when ORTIZ was still in Miami that CATII wanted the curare shipped to him there via a Viaca pilot.

3. As was stated in Reference B, we do not approve of these activities and would like to discuss them with ANCLEVE-15, pointing out that they could jeopardise his employment here with CIRASH-4; but our present relationship with ANCLEVE-15 precludes such discussions. Meanwhile, the case officer will wear his special armored shirt to all meetings with ANCLEVE-15.

C. HVCA-14975

1. ANCLEVE-15 vas contacted by Oscar C. KALBING again on 2 February 1968. ANGLEVE-15 is villing to provide the Station with any information that comes his way in CIRASH, and the Station has agreed to pay hin à 1000 per month for such information.

2. We will, of course, handle ANCLAVE-15 as a "hostile", as requested in Reference A, although we do not share Headquarters' alarm concerning ANCLEVE-15's possible engagement in harassment of communists. This is not the type of activity that ve would choose for ANCLEVE-15, of course; and, as stated in Reference C, ve had intended to advise hin to stay clear of it in order not to jeopardize his position with CIRASH-4. We will not discuss this with him now, however, and risk exposing the source, CIRASH-15, to a "hostile". While we would hope, if we did talk to ANCLEVE-15 about these activities and asked his to desist, that he would comply, we would not be overly surprised if he did not. We are only fooling ourselves if we think that agents, whom ve like to consider we "control", are telling us everything they do.

3. At the risk of belaboring the point, it is precisely because he is the kind of person that he is that ANCLEVE-15 is able to become the trusted confidant of people like CIRAS-4, CIRASH-6, Remberto UZCATEGUI and Gustavo ORTIZ, all of whom way be considered somewhat unsavory characters but who, whether or not we like it, run an important part of the security system in Venezuela. and it is precisely because of ANCLEVE-15Is position as such a trusted confidant that we are interested in him.

4. We will attempt to ascertain ANCLEVE-15's motives, as requested in Reference A, but this task will be considerably hampered by our need to : handle nim as a "hostile", unich vill preclude the use of some of the basic tools of investigation, such as the SGSWIRL and the levying of requirenents.

5. We are attaching copies of some of the reports that ANCLAVE-15 passed at his first meeting with a Station case officer on 22 January 1968. At the second meeting he said he would try to obtain for us copies of the interrogation of Antonio ROMERO Celis, of CICLOSE face, and the report from the CIVISTA agent who recently returned from Cuba (see MADRID-3121 and CARACAS-8318). ANCLEVS-15 is only now really getting deeply into his work with CIRASH, having just settled his family into an apartment on 1 February 1968, and he expects to be able to furnish a great deal more in the near future. In spite of the problems inherent in some of ANCLEVE-15's friendships and peripheral activities, we are hopeful that this is going to be a productive and valuable operation for the Caracas Station.

NOTES

1. In a Spanish questionnaire of Personal Information made out in 1961, Subject listed his brother Raul POSADA-Carriles as an administrator of the Narianao Electric Company as a relative in some government service. He did not list his brother Roberto in this section, although he did list Roberto in Para 16, Subject: Brothers and Sisters.

2. In another signed but undated Spanish Personnel Information form of apparently 1965, he again listed both his brothers in Section N. Subject: Brothers and Sisters, and in Section N he again listed his brother Raul, who he stated he believed to be working for the Cuban government as an engineer. He again failed to list his brother Roberto.

3. Concerning his PRQ Part I filled out in March 1965, again no mention of his brother Roberto appears in Section XIV, Subject: Relatives, Acquaintances and Contacts. in any Government Service.

4. According to POSADA's own admission in an LC Flutter of 14 April 1965, he had been involved in planning for a Guatemalan coup headed by Roberto ALEJOS-Arzu. This matter later came to the attention of the FBI. There is an FBI report dated 17 May 1965 in the 201. AMCLEVE-15 also furnished information on this Guatemalan coup for JMWAVE, who disseminated this information in July 1965.

5. AMCLEVE-15 informed JMWAVE concerning other independent exile operations into Cuba in July of 1965.

6. His PRQ Part II, Section XI, dated September 1965, says that "Subject is of good character, very relaible and security

7. An FBI report of 30 September 1965 outlines the contacts that had been made by some Americans seeking to purchase pistols, blasting caps, hand gernades and silencers. This is the first indication in the 201 that Subject was involved with Frank Lang "Lefty" Rosenthal, Miami, who had the reputation of gambler and hoodlum associated with other hoodlums and jewel thieves in the Miami area.

8. In a report filled out by Subject on 21 April 1966 to update his employee file, Subject again reported his brother Raul POSADA in government service but failed again to report brother Roberto POSADA.

An FBI report of 29 July 1966 and another for 1 August 1966 both commented that Subject had been approved by the exile groups to accept the position of military leader of the newly formed alliance.

10. On 1 August 1966 AMCLEVE-15 was transferred from the Training branch to the CI branch of JMWAVE. He was to be used to report on the activities of the central Junta.

Subject stated that his mother told him that his brother Roberto was in England on a purchasing mission for the GOC and that some time soon his brother Roberto would travel to Spain. Subject's mother expected Roberto to be out of Cuba for two months. He stated that he last knew his brother to be employed for the Cuban Telephone Company in Havana and in Cienfuegos, Las Villas Province. He said that he last saw his brother Roberto in April 1961. This is at variance with info in the 1961 Questionnaire which stated he came to the U.S. as a political exile 28 February 1961.

12. A. JMWAVE 3182 (IN 01749), 23 September 1966, stated that Madrid-8990 (IN 85265) reported that Roberto arrived in Madrid from Havana 26 August 1966.

    R. Houston, General Counsel, Subject: Luis Clemente POSADA-
    Carriles, reported FBI information concerning one "Lefty"
    Rosenthal and concerning U.S. citizen Norman Rothman. Through
    Rothman, Rosenthal was put in touch with Subject. Rosenthal
    understood that Subject was attached with CIA and claimed that
    Subject supplied him with caps, primers, and C-4 explosives.
    Rosenthal was reported to have asked Subject to supply more
    explosives and associated materials. The Justice Department.
    sent to the Agency a report from the security section of
    the FBI which stated that POSADA was a CIA agent.

15. According to index cards, Norman Rothman has a long
    history of gambling, illegal arms dealing and other shady dealing
    in the U.S., Cuba, and Mexico. Card dated July 1961.

18. Cable DIRECTOR-15805, 29 June 1967, requested replies to series of questions concerning AMCLEVE-15's activity with ROSENTHAL and FBI. JMWAVE replied in JMWAVE-7953 (IN 02284), 30 June 1967. JMWAVE stated that AMCLEVE-15 had failed to report the October 1966 transactions with Rosenthal until 9 June 1967, and therefore the Miami FBI was not notified until 15 June 1967. JNWAVE stated that AMCLEVE-15's explanation for not reporting the October 1966 transaction was that he "just forgot."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

18. Cable DIR 3805, 29 June 1967 requeste replies to series of questions concerning AMCLEVE-15's activity with ROSENTHAL and FBI. JMWAVe replied in JMWAVE-7953 IN 02284, 30 June 1967. JMWAVE stated that AMCLEVE-15 had failed to report the October 1966 transaction with Rosenthal until 9 June 1967, and therefore the Miami FBI was not notified until 15 June 1967. JMWAVE stated that AMCLEVE-15's explanation for not reporting the October 1966 transaccion was that he "just forgot."

19. In UFGA-28079, dated 31 July 1967, it stated that AMCLEVE-15 planned to seek employment in Caracas, Venezuela, through an old friend who resides there. This information may have been given to JMWAVE in either 11 July 1967 meeting or on a 21 July/1967 meeting. DIR-24039 states that KIFOBALT-1 reported that he met Luis POSADA in Miami the week before. POSADA had informed KIKOBALT-1 that POSADA had approached the Bolivian consul in Miami offering POSADA's services as interpreter/ guerrilla fighter in Bolivia. POSADA said that a reply had come back from KICHEER-1 saying KICHEER-1 approved the salary of $800 per month and that the Miami Bolivian Consul was authorized a $500 advance to PORADA. POSADA left the impression with KICOBALT-1 that POSADA departing for La Paz soon. Cable stated: "APOSADA is unsavory character who is messed up in shady deals in Miami."
    KICOBALT-1 and KICOLBALT-2 were depressed at the thought of POSADA being in Bolivia. DIRECTOR-24439, August 1967, requested cable content of memorandum KICOBALT submitted to JMWAVE and all other material related to POSADA's Bolivian job.

21. JMWAVE-8577 IN 24285, 2 August 1967 stated that while AMCLEVE-15 is not a paragon of virtue he cannot be classified as an unsavory character. His involvement in shady deals in the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 112

past 2 pears resulte almost entirely from Sta ns (and
(eventually) encouragement. He followed directions and reported
fairly well."

20. JMWAVE-8569 IN 242899, 2 August 1967 summarized
    KICOBALT-1's report. KICOBALT-1 met ANCLEVE-15 on 28 July.
    AMCLEVE-15 said he was going to Bolivia to help train a special
    unit in guerrilla warfare. KICOLBATOI confirmed that ANCLEVE-15
    was in touch with the Bolivian consul in Miami and the Bolivian
    military attache to whom AMCLEVE-15 had made the offer to organize
    the group of Cuban guerrilla training officers. JMWAVE felt that
    either ANCLEVE-15 came up with the idea on his own or
    some leak occured during initial contacts on this program.
    Since this was in conflict with statement AMCLEVE-15 made to
    JMWAVE that AMCLEVE-15 was seeking employment in Caracas.

22. JMWAVE-8748 IN 29699, October 1967, sent to Caracas,
    info director, gave Caracas first information concerning Subject's
    plans to travel to Caracas on 21 August 1967. MA AMCLEVE-15

    headquarters traced identifiable with Venturini.

23. JMWAVE Internal Memorandum-1592, 10 August 1963 stated
    AMCLEVE-15 plans to go to Caracas.

24. CARACAS-7589 IN 32469, 15 August 1967 identified Ricardo
    Venturini as mentioned in liaison report of January 1967 as a
    member of the Cuban DSE.

25. JMWAVE-8866 In 34036 17 August 1967 advised no contact
    be made by AMCLEVE-15 for two reasons:

1. His name was mentioned as, CIA agent on


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

GOC radio and TV during Laso conference.

2. He has also been involved in shady deals *MAFIA*/ in Miami, although undertaken at JMWAVE behost might prejudice his effective use.

26. JMWAVE-8997 IN 40592, 28 August 1967: AMCLEVE-15 had just returned to Miami to obtain visa to enable him to work in Venezuela. Reports he obtained job at DIGEPOL through Rafael TREMOLS Fresneda and Gustava ORTIZ Faez.

27. JMWAVE-9080 In 44174, 1 September 1967 states that AMCLEVE-15 now uncertain about returning to Caracas. Says DIGEPOL job would pay only about $250 per month which he claims too little to live in Caracas. AMCLEVE-15 actively seeking job Miami (Case Officer Comment: This seems direct turn-about from Para 2 JMWAVE-8997 sent 3 days before) AMCLEVE-15 now states he would be willing to go back to DIGEPOL or other job in Caracas to work for CIA but he requires total income Approximately $600 per month to cover cost of living.

1.  The Station desires to explain its viewpoint on ANCLEVE-15
    clearly because of what could conceivably be construed to be a tone
    of impatience in the first line of Reference A. First of all, why do
    we want to hire ANGLEVE-15? Our objective is to use him as a unilateral
    venetration of CIRAS!! and CIVISTA, which controls that organization.
    Specifically, we would like to penetrate the inner circle surrounding
    IDENTITY and CIRASH-4. The recent provocation (reported in reference C)
    which we believe was run by IDENTITY is a clear indication of the need
    for this type of penetration over and above the normal need for
    penetration of security services.

2.  What we are not trying to do is to make a CIGOAL-1 or
    AVOT-200 out of ANCLEVE-TS: that is, put him on the payroll as an
    advisor to CIRASII-4. Fe want to be very clear on this point, since
    this way be the cause of Beadquarters' concern. llis role will not be
    advisory. ANCLEVE-15 is to be used to obtain counterintelligence
    information to protect the Station and its operations and to get for
    us that portion of the intelligence available in CIRASIl which is not
    made available to the Station via the liaison channel.

3.  From the information available to us, AMCLEVE-15 seems to
    present an almost golden opportunity to Caracas Station: i.e., a cleared
    KOFIRM agent (who although terminated still reports to FOFIRM when in
    the JNKAVE area), who is a well-placed "hombre de confianza" of the
    chief of CIRASI! and the chief of the special investigative unit within
    IVISTA which may have renitoring of FOFIRM activities as one of its
    cbjectives. We say "seers to present" because, although we have
    confirmation from CIRAS-15 that NICLEVE-15 does in fact hold the
    position described above, we are of an open mind regarding the
    practicability of his use and we are completely willing to accept any
    information that would militate against his secure and fruitful employment.

We have chosen to send this communication by dispatch, rather than by cable alene with reference B, because we do not want to give wide dissemination to what might be interpreted as a difference of opinion between the Station and its Headquarters Desk. We do feel, however, Headquarters opposition to the use of AMCLEVE-15 has been consistant since his case was first brought to our attention. Fe assume that Headquarters and JMWAVE have some data concerning AMCLEVF-15 which we have not yet received and which results in Headquarters' view of h: his use. If this is the case, we hope that it will be forwarded soon so that we can drop the matter. If on the other hand, Headquarters objects to the concept of the operation, we would like to develop a cordial exchange of views to see if these divergent views can be reconciled.

RE: TIPIC TRASH CIVISTA ANCLAVE-15
Activities of Identity of Reference A and Plans to form an Anti-Communist Occ. Squad.

1.  Forwarded under separate cover is a report submitted by CIRASH-15 concerning the organisation of Identity of Reference A's office. On 23 November 1967 a meeting was held in Identity of Reference A's office with members of the PTJ who were to work for Identity of Reference A in the special investigative unit he is establishing. Identity of Reference A announced that the director of the PTJ had refused to let his men work in Identity of Reference A's organisation, although the request for their services had come from CIGIRO-1. The men were given until the end of November to decide whether or not they would quit the PTJ to begin work for Identity of Reference A. (We have not yet heard of their decisions).

2.  A new member of Identity of Reference A's office who was present at the meeting was ANCLAVE-15. It was CIRASH-15's opinion that ANCLAVE-15 had been brought to Venezuela with the help of Gustam ORTIZ Faez, an old friend of CIRA-4. After the meeting CIRASH-14, ANCLAVE-15 and Identity of Reference A went to ORTIZ's house where Ortiz showed them some explosives which were to have been used in blowing up an unidentified ship. (The explosives were not used as the operation was cancelled). ANCLAVE-15 showed the group some explosive devices which he had smuggled in from Miami. ANCLAVE-15 said that he was able to smuggle anything into the country because CIRASH would send a CIRASH official car to pick him up at customs.

3. ANCLEVE-15 and ORTIZ asked CIRASH-15 to join them in an anti-Communist group which would harass Communists without the knowledge of CIRASH-4. On another visit to ORTIZ's house, CIRASH-15 met two Cubans who had been imprisoned in La Cabaña prison in Cuba and who had apparently been helped out of Cuba by ORTIZ and will work with him in the anti-Communist goon squad. CIRASH-15 also met another Cuban exile in the group whose alias is "Fósforo". CIRASH-15 expects to be able to identify these Cubans in the near future.

4. This type of goon-squad activity is not what we would like ANCLEVE-15 to be mixed up in, and if and when we get in touch with him we will request that he stay away from such activities so as not to antagonise CIRASH-4 or Identity of Reference A.

5. Please assign Identity of HVCA-14778, dated 5 December 1967 a cryptonym in the CIVISTA series.

"...Gentlemen, this is to report you that Dr.OLIVARES BOSQUE (P.T.J. Director), has refused the Ministry of Interior, Dr.LEANDRO MORA, the permission of having you here to work with me. Unless you decide to quit your job in P.T.J. and then join my office, I am afraid it will be impossible for us to work together, at least openly..... I think that Dr. OLIVARES's great fault of cooperation with us, is increasing Dr.-LEANDRO MORA's feeling of unfriendliness towards him and myself as well. So, each one of you, shall have time until the 30 of this month to give me an answer as to about the decision to renounce P.T.J. or not; definitely, due to actual conditions, it is not possible to "borrow you" from P.T.J....."

After everybody left, I stood a little more with Dr, Uzcategui, and he introduced me to a new member of the office: *Osvaldo Campiles, alias Ante,(a) "Tatuin"*, whose cédula number (found out later) is 8-977664. Was guy in Cuban, and has just come-in from Miami-Florida. As far as I could find out later on, the man who helped him into Venezuela is *Dr. Gustavo* (please remember of report about him), a Cuban veterin... now DIMOPOL Director.. is

newcomer to Dr.Uzcategui. He is a Cuban refugee in Miami, since the the on Day of 5.1... Few years ago. Im already mentioned him. Novikov, has got into relationship with Novikov, which I have already been very impressed by my silencers ( or .....) which I have just given to Dr.Uzcategui. He said that, while in the ....., he used to work on silencers and other technical stuff to...... called groups into live there and also in conjunction with to.....


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 127

## 2.1. ":Eduardo:" showed me some stuff he had taken with him (fuses, booby-trap switches, detonating cord, infrared devices, time-pencils for demolition charges and incendiary devices).

It was then when Dr. Gustavo "Chili" pulled out from underneath the bed a big heavy package and said it was a ferrocharge of pentolite, mixed with magnets, which was to be used in wrecking a ship. He did not specify what ship it was, how he got the bomb, but he said that he had to cancel the "operation". Of course, I did follow with interest what they talked about, so, in the general talk, Eduardo said that he could pass all that stuff through the Customs, because a prowl-car from DIGIPOL (ordered by Erasto Fernandez) was awaiting for him inside the airport in Maiquetia, that he had his family in Miami, - and, as soon as he could find an apartment, he would go back to Miami, pick up his family and a lot more of "stuff" he has left there, and bring all of it to Venezuela, the same way he did it the first time. On the other hand, Dr. Gustavo Chili, whom I know since a long time, helped by his friendship with Erasto Fernandez (who, reports directly to Dr. Leandro Mora), has asked me (Eduardo had as well) if I wanted to help them off to "Inturk" so as to arrive here in Venezuela. But they did not want Eduardo to know about this yet, because that could create more problems to Erasto's activities. In other words, they need my services. I am leaving for future operations against communist leaders, properties, meetings, etc; it's got to be something like a C.I.A., a group formed only, or mostly, by highly important and long term anti-communist people. In few words, this is what, up to now, I have been proposed. I have been able to find out that Dr. Gustavo Chili, gets, somehow, letters from Cuba; mostly from old friends who want to get a possibility to come to Venezuela. Visiting Dr. Vargas' house last week, met there a couple of other Cubans who spent a long time in a Cuban prison called "La Cabana" (after the day of Pigs Invasion). I do not know their names so far, but it will not be long, before I do. The general objective when I go over there, is that of organizing and creating a group that may cause as much trouble to the reds as possible.

rio, Eduardo and another Cuban called "Fosforo", prepared to sabo-
tage a Communist meeting, with a " Co gas-bomb" ("chlorine new weapon
attacks").Action did not take place because meeting place -
was too vigilated by communists,and there was no chance for Eduar-
do to place the 20 minutes delay CS (gas-bomb) inside the auditorium,
while Dr.Gustavo CATIE and "Fosforo" played a protection role for
Eduardo with automatic pistols ready in their trouser belts. Eduardo
is now in Miami, and will be back at the end of this week with his
family.In a very confidential way, he's been asked to bring back
bullets cal. .32 (Dr.Uzcategui gave him $100.00 for a silencer cal.
22).He will also take back all the war material he has left in
Miami.He will also try to get in touch with links (Cuban and C.I.A.)
to get as much stuff as possible,to be used probably here.Dr. Uzcá-
tegui, beside asking Eduardo to buy bullets and a silencer cal.22
for himself, also asked Eduardo, on his way back to Carecas, to stop
in Puerto Rico a couple of days for something he had to do there.
Dr.Uzcategui has asked me what I think about Eduardo's capabilities
as a member of the office,in the field of sabotage,etc.,explosives,
etc.: told Dr.Uzcategui it was good to have people with some background
in the mentioned field.On the other hand, Eduardo and Dr. ORTIZ want
me to help them with instruccion on the same technical field, but do
not want either Dr, Uzcategui or Erasto Fernandez to know about it.
Dr.Uzcétegui has asked me to find people for the office.He needs, for
the moment being, some 6 guys, as P.T.J. has refused their own......
Everything is normal for the moment. This is all I have to report.

**Hqs believes that, in view unsettled DIGEPOL situation and vague and unsubstantiated nature AMCLEVE-15 job possibilities, not advisable make financial commitment to him to enable him to return to Venezuela.

While F has bad rep not clear why. Fernandez was cooperative with Station previous time no clear indications he enriched himself by accepting bribes from left.

Question: What do you do?

Question: What do we do to alter it with cyanide?

Lovcevica: I prepare them.

Question: What were those bullets prepared for?

Lovcevica: Those bullets were prepared over there in 1964. (Toto--thoracic) in Havana, made of an organization called (STI. Vice) asked us to prepare them. In spite of the fact that I knew nothing about chemistry, for attempts on lives, to make sure of the death of the individuals against those lives attempts were to be made. They were for specific attempts.

Question: What plans were made in the United States or among the counterrevolutionary circles. What is the main objective sought?

Lovcevica: Well, the physical elimination of the leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro.

Question: The physical elimination of Maj. Fidel Castro?

Lovcevica. Yes, sir.

Question: Those counterrevolutionary groups which operate from Flobita, from Miami, -
do they have the approval of the North American Government for their actions?

Lovcevica: Almost entirely. For example the most opportunist elements were there eventually small groups to obtain dollars from the US Government for their existence. Those that have sincere lines among all the organizations in exile with the Central Intelligence Agency. We have, for example, the case of (JRI. Front) which-forty?

Question: You say that you had a .22-cal. pistol with poisoned bullets for specific attempts on lives?

Lovcevica: Yes, sir.

Question: I would like you to clarify something more. That specific attempts against whom further, were those attempts to be made after the triumph, or before?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

MEMORANDUM FOR ANCLEVE/15's File

14 August 1967

SUBJECT: Salary Misunderstanding

ORIGINATOR: Gary L. FLUSTIKOFF

1.  ANCLEVE/15 submitted the attached note, written by him, to the writer. In the note ANCLEVE/15 says "he is not asking for anything but wants the records checked regarding his past salary of $325.00 per month. ANCLEVE/15 claimed "Chip" (Grover T. LYTICOTT, his former CO) told him that effective October 1966 he would be paid $100.00 per month by COFACT, while the balance would be placed in a bank for him.

2.  For the record AMCLEVE/15 was told by the writer and not Chip that effective August 1966 (not October) he would be cut back in his salary to approximately $100.00 por month. He was cut back from $350.00, not $325.00, for reasons of economy and cover and he was agreeable to the cutback. The writer did not tell him that the balance of approximately $212.00 was being saved for him; only that his gross salary would be raised to $350.00 in the event RECK ever stopped paying him his salary. (It was assumed that his RECE employment might be short-lived). For administrative reasons the salary cutback was not offective until September 1966 and from latter date until December 1966 he was paid $111.13. From January 1967 until June 1967 he was paid $110.90 due to a FICA change. During the entire period, September 1966 to June 1967, AMCLEVE/15 was budgeted by JMWAVE in the amount of $350.00 gross with the notation of his voucher of "possibility of paying balance later". Then. in June 1967 ANCIEVE/15's salary was increased to $350.00 gross, as so promised, because he was unemployed during most of June.

3.  The writer explained the above to ANCLEVE/15 and he seemed satisfied. He told the writer that he had to borrow some money to cover expenses in connection with his trip to Venezuela.

# POSADA, Luis
INTERROGATION OF DA AGENTS AT LASO SESSION

:: August 1967

CUBA
LASO CONFERENCE
Havana Domestic Television Service in Spanish 0107 GMT 7 Aug 67 Official Use Only

Question: What kind of weapons did you bring for assassinations?

Loucerica: We brought two Beretta pistols with silencers, a .22-cal. pistol with a silencer, and an M-3 with a silencer.

Question: What kind of ammunition did you bring for the .22-cal. pistol with silencer?

Larcerica: Part of the ammunition was conventional bullets and part of it was cyanide-tipped bullets.

Question: Who prepared the bullets with cyanide?

Loucerica: I prepared them.

Question: What were those bullets prepared for?

Lancerica: Those bullets were prepared over there in Miami. (Polo--phonetic)
Miranda, member of an organization called (?El Race) asked me to prepare them, in spite of the fact that I know nothing about chemistry, for attempts on lives, to make sure of the death of the individuals against whose lives attempts were to be made, but they were for specific attempts.

Question: What plans were made in the United States or among the counterrevolutionary circles, what is the main objective sought?

Loucerica: Well, the physical elimination of the leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro.

Question: The physical elimination of Maj. Fidel Castro?

Lancerica: Yes, sir.

Question: Those counterrevolutionary groups which operate from Florida, from Miami, do they have the approval of the North American Government for their actions?

Lancerica: Almost entirely. For example the most opportunist elements over there create small groups to obtain dollars from the US Government for their subsistence, but there are close links among all the organizations in exile with the Central Intelligence Agency. We have, for example, the case of (?El Race) which--through Luis Posada, who is known by all as a CIA agent--belongs, that is all its activities of icing on Cuban coasts, actions against merchant ships and so forth, are linked to the CIA.

Question: You say that you had a .22-cal. pistol with poisoned bullets for specific attempts on lives?

Loucerica: Yes, sir.

Question: I would like you to clarify something more. What specific attacks, against which figures, were those attempts to be made with that type of weapon?

Loucerica: Well, against the most prominent figures of the revolution according to existing circumstances and according to the individuals who were going to execute them. Specifically, it is to be supposed that if the idea of counterrevolution were to take root in Havana, well then the effort to kill the leader of the revolution could be intensified.

This was no problem with Lens on this case. At Dpt instructions ORWAVE Terminated ANCLEVE-15 and The FBI funds (or rather the Justice Dept.) planned to use A-15 to collect evidence against a Biscaino gambling, however, The Dept. of Justice overruled this plan. J. Edgar did not want to risk leaving A-15 a free body.

Since then, A-15 became involved with RICOSPLT-142, which for caused a major stir. I am holding the file until all the dust settles.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief, WH

INFO: COS, Caracas

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: TYPIC/Operational

* Termination of AMCLEVE/15

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

Action Required: See para 7

Reference: JMWAVE-8156, 11 July 1967

1.  As reported in reference, AMCLEVE/15 was terminated effective 11 July 1967. AMCLEVE/15 was terminated because he resigned from his position as a military coordinator/member of RECE (Cuban Representation in Exile), a Miami based Cuban exile organization, in early June 1967 and he thus lost access to his target, as AMCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of RECE since 1 August 1966. In addition, JMWAVE does not have a current need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT organization has the capability to penetrate and report on RECE if and when the need should arise. After AMCLEVE/15 resigned from RECE, he was a candidate for employment in the AMOT organ- ization; however, because of his involvement with Frank "Lefty" ROSENTHAL and for other security reasons it was decided that the AMOT organization should not hire him.

2.  AMCLEVE/15 began his employment with WOFACT in April 1965 and initially served as an instructor in the Maritime Training Branch of JMWAVE. He was also active in reporting on exile activities. On 1 August 1966, AMCLEVE/15 was transferred to the CI Branch where he was used to report on the activities of RECE until his resignation in early June 1969.

3.  Since AMCLEVE/15 was amicably terminated, JMWAVE does not envision any problems at this time. AMCLEVE/15 plans to seek employment in Caracas, Venezuela, through an old friend who resides there.

4.  On 21 July 1967 AMCLEVE/15 was given a termination bonus of $650.00, which is equivalent to two months salary, minus FICA and federal income tax. He was paid $549.60 net.

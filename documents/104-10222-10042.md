MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14
Charlotte Bustos-Videla

1. It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted from GS-13 to GS-14.

2. The performance of this officer has been characterized for many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out- standing. She has been able to establish herself as indispensable in each Headquarters Branch or Field Station assignment, usually functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned. Since return to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico, her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and growth potential. She is currently chief of the Cuban and CA Section of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her assigned duties. She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet Imaginative officer greatly appreciated by her supervisors. In short, she is a true professional who performs beyond her grade level.

3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency since 1951, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and advancing brilliantly with each new challenge offered. She achieved professional status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing in Latin American affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assignments, a voracious appetite for work and a penchant for exceptionally precise and thorough production. A review of her career to date can lead to the conclusion that she has always risen successfully to each new professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her maximum capacities, While she has had little supervisory experience in the field, her supervisor was of the option that she is a "natural leader". This has been borne out in her performance in her current capacity as a Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and professional aplomb, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive to guidance and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

4. This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language to maximum advantage in her work. Formal testing recently confirmed her high proficiency in that language. Coupled with a comprehensive training record and her invaluable experiences over a twenty year period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each of several recognized specializations, including CI operations, functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varied covert action activities.

5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's internal troubleshooter. Her duties included the maintenance of watchlists, screening of travel documents, processing of raw technical take, target analysis, reports writing, operational support, handling of outside contract agents, and special assignments as the Chief of Station's Executive Assistant.

6. The employee is occasionally called upon by the Office of Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending in December 1972. Meanwhile, her absence from her new job is felt sorely by the Branch. It is expected that her current assignment will last about two years.

7. In summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance and which she so justly deserves.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, QSI - Honor and Merit Awards Panel
SUBJECT: Request for Quality Step Increase (HR 20-37) Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla

1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Charlotte Bustos-Videla.

2. As noted in the attached fitness report, Subject's porformance of her duties has been uniformly outstanding. In addition to her responsibilities in the Cuban section of the Mexico City Station, she has recently been made the executive assistant to the Chief of Station at Mexico City. In this job, she screens all incoming material for matters of interest to the Chief and Deputy Chief of Station. She also continues performing her past functions in the Cuban section for the Station.

3. Subject's present high quality of performance is typical of her performance since she entered the Agency in 1951, It is fully expected that this level of performance will bo maintained.

4. Although the prosent Chief of Station was not the reviewing official on the attached fitness roport, he has commented that he considered Subject an outstanding officer and has recommended that she be considered for a Quality Step Increase,

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade 08-13
Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla

1. The promotion of Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla from 08-12 to GS-13 is hereby recommended.

2. This exceptional officer has now been performing at a senior level for several years and, while recognition through a Quality Step Increase was granted her last year, her sustained performance clearly exceeding the requirements of a G8-13 qualifies her for a promotion at this time. Subject is one of the outstanding women who have demonstrated their capacity for even further advancement within the Agency and will probably continue to advance in the future. The present recommendation is based on already demonstrated ability to operate at a senior level.

3. Subject is 36 years old and has been in grade as a 03-12 for the past five and one-half years.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Charlott 4. Bastos-Vitola

THROUGH : Head of 63 Career Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1.  As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment history and current career-field of all employces in the Agency to identify those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina- tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee does not meet the basic requirements of IR 20-50 for participation, I have accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board. This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys- tem may be designated participants as soon as possible,

2.  In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici- pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 yeara of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulat ton.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS (Panel A)
SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to GS-13
Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla.

1. The promotion to GS-13 of Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla
   is recommended. Mrs. Bustos-Videla entered the Agency in
   August 1951 as a GS-5 and rapidly and deservedly rose to a
   GS-12 grade by 1959.

2. This recommendation is based on Mrs. Bustos-Videla's
   performance during the past three years as the senior assist-
   ant to the various chiefs of the Mexican desk/branch, who
   unanimously have found her to be extremely competent and re-
   liable both in her routine assignments and special tasks
   occasionally levied on her, such as country studies, compila-
   tion of programs, requirement reviews, etc.

3. Mrs. Bustos Videla has consistently responded with
   intelligence and clarity and has materially contributed to
   orderly imaginative administration of Headquarters support to
   a most active station. In the process, she has been instru-
   mental in training on-the-job innumerable officers both for
   desk assignments and in preparation for field assignments.

4. For her outstanding performance she received a quality
   step increase in April 1964. This deserved recognition should
   now be followed up at this time by a promotion to the next
   grade in accordance with the consistently good performance at
   the GS-13 level over a prolonged period of time.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Head, Clandestine Services Career Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Approval of Quality Step Increase -
Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla

1. I am pleased to send to you the attached official notification of the approval of the Quality Step Increase which you recommended for this employee.

2. The salary increase accomplished by the award of a Quality. Step Increase is important and tangible evidence of the esteem in which the employee so recognized is held. However, I believe the commendatory and incentive benefits of this award will be partially lost unless it is presented in an appropriate ceremony which will afford the individual recognition among co-workers and supervisory officials. Also, I believe such recognition serves to inspire other er.ployees to aspire to earning such recoention,

3. May I ask, therefore, that you arrange to have this Quality Step Increase presented at an appropriate ceremony.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DDP/OP

THROUGH : Chief, Clandestine Services Personnel Office

SUBJECT : Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla -- Request for Quality Stop Increase

1. It is recommended that a Quality Step Increase for Mrs. Charlotte Z. Bustos-Videla be endorsed by you for the reasons presented in the attached memorandum prepared by the Chief, Western Hemisphere Division.

2. A review of Mrs. Bustos-Videla's Official Personnel File reports favorably regarding the quality of her work. Without exception, every supervisor's report has been identified by various area supervisors as "Superior" and "Outstanding." Likewise, nothing in other records maintained by the Office of Personnel contradicts or modifies the impressive record made by Mrs. Bustos-Videla.

3. Testimony to the high regard which officials of WI Division view this officer's work is furnished by noting that Mrs. Bustos-Videla is the first female officer to be proposed for a QSI by WI and one of a total of but three officers nominated by that Division for the award since the QSI provision of the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962 became effective in CIA approximately fifteen months ago.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Plans

ATTENTION : DDP/OP

SUBJECT : Request for Quality Step Increase for Charlotte Bustos-Videla

1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is recommended that a quality step increase be approved for Charlotte Bustos-Videla.

2. As stated in the accompanying Fitness Report, Subject's performance of her duties has been uniformly outstanding. In addition to her responsibilities as the desk officer for Mexico FI and Operational Support Projects, she carries a heavy burden in the areas of administration, preparation of special reports and training of personnel. She frequently represents the Mexico Section in dealings with other elements of the Agency and acts for the Chief of Section in his absence, subject's performance clearly exceeds the normal requirements of the assignment and of her present GS grade level.

3. Subject's present high quality of performance typifies her performance over a period of several years and it is fully expected that this level will be maintained,

4. Consideration was given to the granting of a Merit Award but the quality step increase seems more appropriate in this case. Subject has been passed over for promotion in the past, and due to limitations as to

area of assignment, it is unlikely that a promotion to grade GS-13 can be obtained. The salary increase is therefore thought to be the most fitting reward for her outstanding service.

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-13
Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla

1. Mrs. Charlotte Bustos-Videla entered on duty with WH Division in August of 1951. She has served on a variety of desks covering South American as well as Mexican and Central American affairs. In each of her assignments she has demonstrated exceptional competence and devotion to duty.

2. Since December 1957 Mrs. Bustos has been assigned to the Mexican Desk and at present is Acting Chief. She is the soul and motor of that desk, managing many of its operations and supervising its staff, many of whom she has trained. She is past mistress of administrative procedures and the which she obtains clearances, maintains liaison and secures necessary approvals while handling the most complicated operational aspects of projects is phenomenal. Her work output is enormous and yet everything is done simply and modestly with a minimum of excess motion. She is an outstanding employee and should be deserving of recognition.

3. It is recommended that Mrs. Bustos be promoted to grade GS-13.

In the 8 months during which she was under my supervision, Mrs. Bustos has performed in that same hard-working, highly-productive style which has become her trademark over the years. She understands the intelligence process from start to finish and is personally experienced with each step along the way, save the agent handling aspects. She excels in each phase of the work.

As chief of the Branch SA and Cuban activities section; she has once again demonstrated her mastery over her assigned duties. She is a sound, dependable, yet imaginative and energetic operations officer, whose performance leaves little to be desired. While she had had little previous supervisory experience, she has in this assignment demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, tenacity and attention to detail, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive to guidance and is sensitive to, and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

In her performance of specific duty No. 2, she has brought to bear upon her daily duties her broad experience, high intelligence and good operational sense, functioning with practically no need of close supervision. It is comforting to know that an assignment given to this employée is always done promptly, professionally and cheerfully.

Her adaptability was demonstrated in her specific duty No. 3. Despite the press of normal daily activity, she was often called upon to produce "crash"

The rater has written an accurate and thorough evaluation of Mrs. Bustos. I concur without reservation in the ratings provided subject. She is an exceptional officer. Her ability to perform a variety of assignments in Headquarters and the Field has measured up to an outstanding record. Her work with subordinates clearly indicate she is a good supervisor. Mrs. Bustos performs all facets of her work in an exemplary manner and in my judgement rates in the upper percentile in the A Category.

papers for the Branch because of her innate talents and
established reliability. She never failed to impress her super-
visor with her production, writing ability and energy. Her overall
performance is clearly in excess of her grade level.

In terms of true cost and security-consciousness, she must also
be considered very strong because she has a positive and aggressive
attitude towards these subjects. It is with deep regret that the
Branch parts with this employee who now moves up to the Division
front office staff.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relations to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

In reviewing my previous fitness report and those of my predecessors, on this fine officer, I find myself hard put not to repeat what has been said so often before. She has been the backbone of this section and of those where she has worked previously. Her work has always shown excellent judgement and ingenuity. A self-starter with tremendous drive and discipline, the amount of work she has produced has been prodigious. An excellent team worker, she has never shirked when-as so often happens - she is asked to take on additional work or work on a matter outside of her regular field. While forceful, she is diplomatic and tactful and is able to present suggestions and criticisms in a pleasant manner. She is one of the most dedicated persons I have met in the Organization, and exceptionally dependable. While, as a woman and a Specialist, she has had little opportunity to handle agents she has done very well with those we have given her to handle. She has showed great ability in the training of two transcribers and in the debriefing of two female agents and their husbands. This is in large part due to her in-depth knowledge of the targets this section is working on. The past few months have been difficult, requiring the complete reorganization of this Section and the termination of the majority of our assets. Under this stress, she has performed in her usual outstanding manner. Perhaps, even a little better. Her handling of a great deal of file work has been excellent, probably in part because she was the one who set it up and has maintained it in its present very good state.

Without any hesitation I concur with the outstanding ratings above. Subject is now up for rotation and we will miss her immensely. For years she has dedicated her entire time to her job which she has done so well. She has been creative, thorough and accurate. Although she has not had supervisory experience at this station, she has performed in a manner which clearly reflects that she would have no problem with supervising. A truly outstanding employee with growth potential.

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

The one criticism of this Officer's work that I and others have made in the past still stands. She tries to do everything and somethings in this business just don't deserve the attention she gives them.

I have no personal knowledge of her supervisor abilities, but believe she is a natural leader.

Subject worked most of Amply Grant the station PBRUMEN section. Sho was clearly outstanding in collating information from all sources during a recent intensified "PBRUMEN" month, determining as a result the overall pattern of the PBRUMEN mission here, spotting operational leads and updating target studies on all PBRUMEN officials as a result. Her final writeup regarding both new information obtained and the gaps that remain was thorough and useful.

Subject is extraordinarily rapid and efficient in researching for info, organizing files and other material and writing up any kind of resulting memo or dispatch. The same might be said perhaps of some other real pros in the IA field. However, in addition, Subject has a good, tough, operations-oriented mind and positively contributes ideas and suggestions re new oporational techniques which the station has used profitably. Subject has natural managerial abilities as recently demonstrated in her organizing TDY help in a station-wide file and watchlist offort in connection with a presidential visit. Her Spanish is more than adequate for reading reports, and handling operational messages in that language. In sum, Subject is a tremendous station asset and would be extremely hard to replace without noting a serious loss in station officiency.

Subject is definitely more than an IA and has performed as such when the station has required an individual with in-depth knowledge of station procedures, operational awareness combined with an ability to prepare studies in a short period of timo. She's thorough, conciso and rapid. One of our hardest workers and most dependable employees.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS -continued

Three rather personalized comments might add meaning to this fitness report. Anyone, particularly a female, fitting the above description of efficiency and achievement can be, and often is a little overbearing and difficult to work with as a person. Subject, withall, is a pleasant personality who knows how to make her contributions and comments in a forthright but tactful manner. Secondly, and this one is a little hard to say, Subject in her voracious appetite for all kinds of facts can at times put undue emphasis on them including factual minutiae as against equally important but more clusive subjective factors. Thirdly, this rating officer has personally observed Subject only working on station premises at an office job, and frankly has no idea how she might function in outside operational work (cultivating poople, working under outside cover).

In July 1969 Subject was transferred from the Cuba Section to the Station front office to serve as an executive assistant to the COS with special responsibility for ensuring that the paper flow of the Station remained under effective control during the period of transition resulting from the assignment here of several senior officers. This transition period necessitated or gave rise to a number of changes in the management and administrative areas of the Station. Subject's performance in this assignment under these circumstances was clearly outstanding. Her sound judgement, imagination and responsiveness to guidance not only contributed to maintaining the stability and momentum of the Station but also made possible an early effort to come to grips with many of the problems which an inflated Registry and a highly dis- tinctive records system created for the new Station management tean. During the ensuing six month period, Subject has recommended and implemented a number of changes which have produced a more effective and less costly records system. Paper holdings have been reduced sub- stantially, input has bann reduced and now conforms to basic CS pro- cedures and requirements. Personnel savings have been effected and supervisory responsibilities more clearly delineated.

To sum up, Subject has made and continues to make a major contribu- tion in a singularly unsensational area of Station activity. Her advice is sought and appreciated not only by the COS and myself, but by other

COMMENTS OF NEVIEWING OFFICIAL It would be difficult to overstate the contri- bution made by Subject to this Station during the past six month period, and I concur fully in the ratings and comments of the Rating Officer. I might add that Subject is one of the more versatile, conscientious and productive employees with whom I have worked in this organization, and that in addition to the administrative/ management role outlined above, continued to provide valuable operational/analytical assistance to the Cuban and other operational sections of the Station. The initiative and imagination shown by Subject in the very complicated administrative management assign- ment have been particularly commendable and her complete familiarity with the country, the language, and the background of the Station has been invaluable during this period of change.

personnel who appreciate her personal and professional qualities. Subject is aware that her current assignment is an unusual one and that she soon may have worked herself out of her current job. Since she speaks fluent Spanish, has a unique ability to get along with people and to get things done, there will be no problem in assigning her back into a position more closely supporting operations. Our operations are certain to benefit thereby.

Subject speaks good Spanish, has considerable initiative, much experience in analytic work and a genuine talent for administrative work.

In view of her past performance, her record at the Station and her potential, Subject who was recommended for promotion to the GS-14 level should be promoted as soon as possible.

Subject's performance during the period of over one year under review continued to deserve the rating of Outstanding. Her major contributions during that period were in the fields of operational research and exploitation of information obtained through technical means. She was, during this period, given full responsibility for the handling of two full time senior transcribers including adminis- trative matters. In view of the difficulty of recruiting target personnel the task of fully exploiting information obtained from technical sources is of great importance. Subject handled this task with her usual enormous capability for work, displaying initiative and great professionalism. She continued, in addition, to handle the other tasks listed in this report together with sensative reporting sent by a separate channel, altogether a much heavier workload than is usually carried by one person. She was helped in this by her good knowledge of Spanish, a talent for administrative work, con- siderable analytic experience and great devotion to her work. Subject should be considered for promotion to the grade of GS-14 at the first opportune moment.

Since her arrival at this Station, Subject's performance has truly been outstanding. She has, on her own initiative, reorganized many of the operational files and procedures of the PBRUMEN Section. She has made particularly useful exhaustive analyses of the documents concerning a number of Station targets not only per request of this Station but also on her own initiative. She has revamped the Section's travel program, curtailing the watchlist to more manageable size and expediting the reporting of travel information to the many customers for such information. Her thorough review of the take of several technical operations has increased their usefulness as well as emphasized their weaknesses.

Subject demonstrates talent for administration, her initiative, sharp analytic mind and good knowledge of Spanish have greatly facilitated the operation of the PBRUMEN Section of this Station at a time of almost complete personnel change. She has not been directly involved with the actual running of operations both because she appears much better suited for the support type work intrusted to her and because she frankly would not have the time under present circumstances to do so. Subject is carrying the workload usually handled by more than one person.

She is efficient, she is fully knowledgeable and capable in her job, she has a friendly, warm, and pleasant personality, and is always ready to respond to her fellow workers with a helping hand.

This exceptionally competent and productive officer continued to perform at a level well above that of the GS-13 slot she occupies. While a good deal of her tremendous effectiveness, stems from experience, continuity on the job and her natural retentive memory, during the period under review she also demonstrated a flair for, and applied her talents to, the solution of relatively major and complex planning and managerial problems in the area of operational support to Mexico Station activities.

To the list of her previously abudantly acknowledged capacity for hard, effective work, talent for training on the job younger officers, diligence, and versatile ability, this rater would like to add a note of appreciation for her everpresent tactfullness and discretion. No weaknesses affecting her present assignment have been noted; she is very careful and realistic in planning for expenditure of funds.

This officer is separately being recommended for promotion to GS-13.

WH will review this fitness report with others during a special meeting scheduled periodically to consider suitable recommendation for outstanding performance.

en foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide be basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, il applicable.

Subject's performance during the rating period has been marked by general excellence. As indicated in Section B her supervision and direction of the Section'p work relating to intel support, administration, preparation of special reports, training personnel, etc. is uniformly outstanding. The fact that these functions are handled in addition to her duties as the desk officer for the FI and Ops Support projects, which she performs with unusual competence, serves to illustrato her value to this Section. She has an exceptional ability independently to determine proper courses of action and to initiate action to carry them out. She has a profound understanding of the area operational program and contributions to it are imaginative and constructive.

In the opinion of the rater Subject's performance compares favorably with any 08-13 desk officer within his experience and she performa occasionally at the 08-14 level. Moreover, she carries out her duties cheerfully, loyally and in close and amicable cooperation with her fellow employees at all levels.

In those aspects of her duties which involve cost e.g. the review of operational projects, she has given close attention to the budgetary matters and has frequently suggested ways in which economies An the operations might be effected.

# REPORT ON FOREIGN LANGUAGE APTITUDE AND EXPERIENCE

(Name)
(Office)
(Sex)
17 September 1949
(Date of testing)

The category checked below is an interpretation of the scores made by the person named above on a battery of foreign language aptitude tests. The relationships between test performance and subsequent training performance of trainees in Agency language training courses are indicated by the graphs next to the aptitude categories. The graphs to the left are for women and the graphs to the right are for men. From these graphs you can read for each aptitude category the probability that a person in that category will perform in an Agency foreign language training course at an average or better-than-average level. For example, 22 per cent of the women who obtain an aptitude rating of "8" can be expected to be average or better in course performance, while 5 per cent of the men with ratings of "3" can be expected to be average or better in course performance. A man needs an aptitude rating of "6" to have about the same expectation of success in language training as a woman with a rating of "8". At the other end of the scale, 10 per cent of either men or women who obtain aptitude ratings of "2" can be expected to do average or better-than-average work in training. The differences in relationship are due to differences between men and women in both training performance and test scores. On the average women are somewhat higher on both.

Since anything other than aptitudes enter into the determination of training course performance, in any class of students there will usually be some whose performance will be better than would be expected from their test scores, just as there will likely be some whose performance is poorer than expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION, PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, and other factors should be considered in selecting people for language training and in interpreting language training results, for example, the number of languages previously studied or learned and the amount of academic and non-academic language-learning experience are factors not measured by the tests but are indicative of probable success in learning a foreign language. Whether such experience was in the same language as the one to be studied or in a different one is, of course, an additional relevant factor.

Foreign languages have been studied or learned by this individual.

This officer is the person chiefly responsible for the Mexico Desk's deserved reputation for excellence and efficiency. The complicated and never-ending tasks of project processing, clearances, tracing, and coordination are handled by her with blinding speed and unerring perfection. Procedural problems are there to be solved, and the solutions come with amazing rapidity. Operational problems are worked out thoroughly and conscientiously. No corners are cut and no principles are compromised.

Never at a loss for an answer, this officer never shrinks from any assignment and instinctively wants to take over any vexing problem which is holding up progress. She is complete mistress of file and record resources and answers all queries within minutes. The most complex budgetary and planning projects are handled by her with deceptive ease.

These qualities of rare efficiency and speed are coupled with an even rarer degree of amiability and cooperativeness. The work which proceeds under her at such a break-neck pace nonetheless goes on in an air of placidity and good humor. The large office staff is run without a trace of tension, jealousy, or friction. All of this is traceable to this officer's fine example and catalytic effect on her colleagues.

12. IN CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE EMPLOYEE AND HIS PREFFRENCE FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT,
    INDICATE YOUR RECOMMENDATION FOR HIS NEXT ASSIGNMENT AND TRAININGI

Would not stand in Subject's way, were she to be fortunate enough to get a Paris assignment. However with her long Mexico background (both Hugs and field) and her multiple talents she has been invaluable in the reorganization of this highly complicated Station under changed circumstances, will continue to be so during the next several years and to lose her would be like losing one's right arm. Therefore we strongly endorse either a second tour or an extension.

TO BE COMPLETED BY APPROPRIATE HEADQUARTERS OFFICE

13. IN CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE EMPLOYEE HIS PREFERENCE FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT, AND THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR COMPONENT, INDICATE YOUR COMPONENT'S RECOMMENDATION FOR HIS NEXT ASSIGNMENT AND TRAINING.

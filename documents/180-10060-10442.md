# Assassination Records Review Board
## Final Determination Notification

AGENCY: HSCA
RECORD NUMBER: 180-10060-10442
RECORD SERIES: STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER:

December 8, 1995

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 18
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Note).

MEMORANDUM

TO: Mr. Sprague

FROM: Bob Lehner

DATE: December 23, 1976

SUBJECT: Cornish F. Hitchcock

Mr. Hitchcock is a very bright young man. He graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center in May, 1975. He then clerked for a Connecticut Supreme Court judge for a year. He did part-time work for Representative McKinney and is now working with a small Washington, D.C. law firm making $200 a week.

I was impressed with his willingness to work hard and his ability to fend off pointed questions.

I recommend we take him.

Dear Rick:

Con Hitchcock is very interested in working on the committee's legal staff. I had hoped to convince him to work on my staff, but he declined. I recommend him very highly. His work is superior and he has a reputation as a tireless worker.

I would hope an interview could be arranged for Monday, December 6. Thanks for your assistance.

Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM

TO: Tom Lambeth

FROM: Robert J. Lehner

DATE: May 26, 1977

SUBJECT: Con Hitchcock

This is to request a salary adjustment from $15,000 to $20,000 per year for Con Hitchcock. Mr. Hitchcock was hired in December at a salary of $15,000. The thought of the then Staff Director and Chief Counsel was that after members of the staff were working here for a period of time and we were able to evaluate their work, salary adjustments would be made. Unfortunately those salary adjustments were never made because of the delay in reconstituting and re-budgeting the Committee.

Mr. Hitchcock graduated from Law School in 1975. The only other attorney on the King Task Force that graduated that year was Sheila Jackson Lee. Her salary is $23,000 per year.

Mr. Hitchcock has demonstrated a quick ability to assimilate factual situations, gives insightful legal analysis of those situations and writes cogently in these areas. He is a definite asset to our team and one of the brightest people we have on the staff.

I had recommended to Al Lewis this same adjustment. Mr. Lewis agreed and was prepared to make that recommendation to the Committee.

For the above reasons, I hereby recommend Mr. Hitchcock's salary adjustment be made forthwith.

OCCURRENCE: Due to reports of popular unrest, political strife, and economic disruptions inside Cuba, it was suggested that the Special Group Augmented consider the value of having an SNIE on Cuba made in the immediate future. The CIA has agreed as a matter of priority to reach a stage in the interrogation of Pedro Roig where he can be surfaced to make public changes of Cuban Communist operations against Latin American nations. For operational effectiveness, the CIA has selected a new area in Cuba for its initial radio broadcasts from a submarine for "Voice of Cuba." The Navy states that the new area is feasible and State has concurred in the theme and content of the broadcast. They will take place around the end of the month. No proposals for actions by the Department of State have been submitted since the appointment of State's special representative, Mr. Hurwitch. They are expected on June 22, 1962.

Special Group (Augmented)

OCCURRENCE:
SGA discussed various possibilities of accomplishing reconnissance of Cuba, ranging from very low level coverage by tactical aircraft to high performance aircraft and drones. Over- flights and peripheral flights were discussed.

It was agreed that the first priority is one high performance mission in the western part of ✓ the island, to be necompammed by ald out. El int suport. Depending on the results of this, a number of similar searches may be mounted. First mission was later approved by higher authority, but the decision on the second proposition left open.

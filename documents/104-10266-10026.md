April 18, June Cobb called the New York DODS office about what to do about her CIA salary on her income tax return.

After discussions with CF/CAMS and George Powell of the Tax Committee, I phoned DODC to tell Cobb the following:

Since she was supposedly a student in Mexico, and she had paid tax on her CIA salary, she was not to list her salary anywhere on her 1966 tax return. However, she should send us a copy of her overt 196 tax return.

21 April 1966

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Finance

VIA: Chief, Contract Personnel Division

SUBJECT: Joyce H. PINETECH (P) - Tax Assessment

1. A covert Federal income tax percentage of two and sight-tenths (02.8) per cent of PINCHCH's gross, texable Agency entitlements has been approved by the Covert Tax Committee. This percentage assessment is effective 1 December 1964, the beginning date of tax year 1965.

2. The retroactive application of this assessment to tax year 1965 will result in a dollar assessment of $84.00 (02.8% of $3,000.00). After applying the 1965 covert tax withholding of $540.00, a refund of $456.00 will be due PIMEDACH for 1965. This eliminates the requirement for a covert tax return for 1965.

3. An acknowledged letter of instruction will be forwarded at a later date.

SUBJECT
ISOLOG/LICOOKY -- Termination of Contact with LICOOKY/1

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES
Action required: retire file, again.
References: A. UNDA 3502, 22 January 1968
B. UNDA 3650, 13 March 1968

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 5 April 1968 agreement was reached that the WOFIRM relationship with her would be terminated. A memorandum of contact (NYM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination. No administrative action is required of either the Base or Headquarters in this instance. Her file can be retired, again, and this time presumably will be the last time.

2. Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/1 holds no ill-will for WOFIRM: she just does not wish to have any relationship with WOFIRM anymore.

3. The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the meeting to wish the writer a pleasant Easter, as she had forgotten to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal contact.

MEMORANDUM

TO: LICOOKY/1 File

FROM: Howard G. FIGALAN

SUBJECT: Meeting with LICOOKY/1, 5 April 1968

5 April 1968

NYM-2689

Distribution:

1-LICOOKY/1

1-WM/Info (paras 3, 4 & 5)

1. A meeting with LICOOKY/1 was held at 1100 hours, Friday, 5 April 1968. We breakfasted, and then held the meeting at the BARTHOLOMEW site. As is detailed below, we reached a mutual agreement that the relationship was not worth pursuing this was thoroughly amicable, and recontact methods are available on both sides.

2. Substantive matters first. LICOOKY/1 said that John GERASSI nad been ill cow.. ... 20 ch for the day, He was inv.ced to lunch at the CMUN that day, Sunday. Apparently, GERASSI, is back in the good graces of the Cuban regime. He told LICOOKY/1 that he woulà be spending this Summer in Arizona.

3. LICOOKY/1 has been commissioned by M. S. ARNONI, editor of *The Minority of One*, to write a piece on the recent intellectual/ political developments in Czechoslovakia.

4. LICOOKY/1 thought up, and is arranging, a Czech film fes.val to egin 15 April. It is to be sponsored by the St. Clemens Fiim Association, St. Clemens Church, 423 West 46th Street (this churca houses the American Place Theatre Robert LOWELL'S group). LICCCKY/1 got this idea from the recent Czech travaiis which she hails as evidence of the power of Czech intellocracy and from the com.......on Referred to in paragraph 3 above. Se contacted the Czech UN MASS which put her in touch with PAVLIC, the Czech Cultural Attache the Washington Embassy. PAVLIC was all for the idea, and wii. be mere for the opening of the festival. Milos FORAN (director the film "Loves of a Blonde") is currently here at the Hotel Cas. (a "Gump on 23rd on the West Side" LICOOKY/'s characterizati and will participate in the festival. KADAR (director of the ". orain Street") has been invited to participate. LICOOKY/1... is to ask PAVLIC waether it would be OK for her to ask DRV. mes film at Columbia and who is a Czech in exile, to part...ate. KY/l is very enthusiastic about this venture.

5. COMMENT: Los FORMAT is mentioned in the article about Cauchoslovakia in the 5 April 1968 issue of *Muganire*.

6. I knew something was bothering LICOOKY/1 and made her drag it out into the open. She started by remarking that WOFIRM and its computer apparently checked the welfare of its old agents every so often, and that this was the nature of our relationship. I explained that this was not the case, that I had found out she was in Manhattan and suggested to Washington that LICCOKY/1 might be of some value to us. This surprised her, and she apologized. She then took off on how when she was in Cuba she had dealt with Fidel and Che and Celia, and when she was involved with Guatemala she was dealing with AREVALO. She said that she didn't want to sound snobbish, but that she was accustomed to dealing with top politicos and intellectuals; she referred to a statement that I had made previously that perhaps she could get Tana de GAMEZ to invite her along to one of Tana's lunches with Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALARCON Quesada. She said that she didn't want WOFIRM to think that she would seek out and cultivate lower level people, that she wasn't built that way. LICOOKY/1 said that even though Tana was a friend and that she liked ner, Tana was not ner equal, and that Täna wasin t 'on her pedestal". That RCON was certainly not in LICOOKY/l's intellectual category. LICOOKY/1 said that she considered herself as very flexible, but not that much. LICOOKY/1 is a "special person" and that WOFIRM bureaucracy-- with the exceptions of "Bill" (her Mexico case officer, a friend of the writer), C/WH/1 (with whom LICOOKY/1 is particularly taken), and the writer (LICOOKY/1 repeatedly assured me that she had a very sincere esteen for me) probably didn't understand or acknowledge this. LICOCKY/1 said her feelings for certain WOFIRMers were one thing, but her dislike of WOFIRM itself was something else. WOFIRM is a massive card index that shows Miguel Angel ASTURIAS as an old "Nicaraguan war-horse" -- ASTURIAS of course is Guatemalan. LICOOKY/1 couldn't stop liking Communists regarāless of WOFIA desires.

and

7. LICOOKY/1 went on and on in this/similar veins, very impassioned, but very straightforward and without personal rancor for the writer. Summing up, the stated reasons as to why she does not wish to continue regular collaboration with WOFIRM are as follows:

A. fear of compromise -- LICCOKY/1 said that were her relationship with us to become known, it would ruin her standing in and associations with the intellectual community:

B. distaste for WOFIRM -- LICOOKY/1 really believes that WOFIRM is a large card file with all the cards aaving. errors on them;

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

SECRET

- 3 -

C.  intellectual honesty -- LICCOKY/1 does not think that her intellectual honesty gains from her WOFIRM relationship;

D.  lack of understanding -- FOFIRM, except for the three officers cited above, does not really understand the real LICCOKY/1.

8. Obviously, the unsaid reasons are the ones that really brought about this "confrontation", in the writer's opinion. These are as follows:

A.  emotional instability -- LICCOKY/1, as has been known for years by the writer, is not the most stable of individuals;

B.  money -- LICOOKY/1 receives no money from us anymore (since her termination in Mexico), and the writer suspects that LICOOKY/1 could have more easily rationalized working for the "Giant Indices in Washington" were she on salary;

c.  sex - in this case, lack of same (LICCOKY/1 comes always to emotional involvement with her male associates, and her Case Officers cannot fulfill this need, thus giving rise to problems; in the past, LICOOKY/1 could easily obtain her physical/emotional fulfillment in Cuba and Mexico without relying on the Case Officer, but now she is getting older and quite shop-worn and cannot compete for attention from men in the environment of a place such as Manhattan);

D.  discipline -- again, in this case, lack of same; LICOOKY/1 tell us what she does, we don't tell her what she should do.

9. LICOOKY/1 exhibited some anguish over this whole affair. She has been upset for the past month, over this as well as over the confused outlook for her in general. It was made very clear at one point what aid and comfort could have been extended to LICOOKY/1 to alleviate her anguish, and the writer beat a hasty retreat to the kitchenette for a tactical drink of water.

10. Not elaborated above were the writer's answers to LICOOKY/1's opinions, but these were effective in cou...ring her logic, if not her actitudes. LICOOKY/1 had to agree t.. WOFIRA did have grounds for its assessment of her performance - not awfully good.

11. At any rate, the entire proceedings were very amicable, and, as mentioned above, LICOOKY/1 stressed that her basic opposition to WOFIRM was not on personal grounds, as she had enjoyed her dealings with her "three favorite contacts". She offered to call the writer anytime she had something tangible to pass on, and that he should do the same. It's just that she would be more comfortable as an ex-agent than as a current one. The writer fully expects to hear from her from time to time.

12. It actually was quite an interesting session.

TO: Chief, DO

FROM: Acting Chief of Base, New York

SUBJECT: ISOLOG/LICOCKY - Tana de GAMEZ

ACTION REQ: Per para 1 & 7

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 7 March 1968, the agent passed on the following information which may be of interest to the appropriate Headquarters components. L/1 apologized for the lack of details, but the agent was not in a position to pump for further information beyond that which was volunteered.

2. On 7 March Tana de GAMEZ, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Spanish origin, said that she had been telephoned the night before by the son of her half-sister Mercedes (last name unknown to L/1), her nephew Roy. The latter is a college student somewhere in Connecticut (possibly the University of Connecticut), and his home is somewhere in Westchester County. Roy said that he was calling his Aunt Tana because he knew that she had worked for OSS during WWII; Tana rejoined that she had never had anything to do with OSS, that she had worked for the Office of War Information (OWI). At any rate, Roy said that he wanted to tell his Aunt Tana that he had been 'recruited' by the CIA, and that he was only going to work for the CIA so as to evade the draft. Upon being questioned on this, Roy maintained that he had been 'recruited' by the CIA on campus.

3. The nephew's statements rather rattled Tana de GAMEZ, to the point where she had to take her heart medicine for palpitations (she has a heart history). Among other things, Tana was upset by the thought of a family member being affiliated with the CIA, even though the nephew is disliked by her as an individual.

4. Tana de GAMEZ was a member of the U.S. delegation to the Havana Cultural Congress in January 1968. She is a well-known figure in the intellectual leftist set in New York, and is outspokenly pro-Castro. She is a member of the editorial board of Grove Press; is a published author herself; and is a close friend and associate of John GERASSI, formerly of Ramparts Magazine.

5. Tana de GAMEZ is the subject of a voluminous file at the LNERGO office here. LNERGO information, which agrees with Base information obtained from L/1, indicates that de GAMEZ is vocal but

harmless. She considers herself a loyal American, but does not find this to be incompatible with being a vigorous "New Left" type. She recently became the Latin American editor of Manhattan FM radio station WEAI, an interesting melange of bourgeois/avant-garde programming slanted toward the left, according to L/1.

6. Tana de GAMEZ is in fraquent contact with Ambassador Ricardo ALARCON Quesada, Permanent Representative of Cube to the United Nations; she also is in contact with Jose Raul VIERA Linares, DGI officer within the CMJN.

7. Tana de GAMEZ probably is the subject of a 201 file at Headquarters; if so, this dispatch should be cross-referenced to that file. If not, the Base suggests that de GAZZ bo indexed.

8. Re paragraph 2 above, L/1 agreed that what the nephew probably meant was that he had been interviewed on campus, and that this to him meant that he had been accepted for employment.

b. It is recommended that Subject be handled by a strong, mature case officer who can and will avoid emotional involvement with the Subject.

c. The case officer should be fully briefed on Subject's background and her emotional and sexual problems. Worthy of particular note is her involvement with John Rettie, BBC correspondent in Mexico and an MI - 6 agent whom the Soviets tried to compromise while he was serving a tour in Moscow.

1. The following summaries indicate no derogatory information on Subject.

2. New York report dated 12/29/59 captioned "June COBB -
   Registration Act-Cuba" furnished CIA 1/8/60. This report ftated that June coop traubiatou μαωμων part sho job for Fidel Castro with the idea of familiarizing the American people with Castro's writing. June Cobb believes Castro is coing a tremendous job in reconstructing the economy of Cuba. However, she stated that in her opinion it is unthinkable that Communism would ever be cabraced by Castro or the people of Cuba. There seems to be no particular significance to this report as this information was previously known by the Agency.

3. Letter to Director, FBI, from Cia dated 11/7/60. captioned "June COBB - Internal Security - Cuba". Bernie Brennan asked June Cobb to deliver some information to Juan Orta who stated that Brennan was not needed anymore. Cobb thought Brennan might have been attempting to obtain a position with the Cuban Tourist Commission. The Agency has no further interest in Brennan. Therefore, there is no significance attached to the report.

4. Washington report dated 4/26/62 captioned "Lyle Stuart - IS - Cuba; SM-C: RA-Cuba", furnished to CIA 5/4/62 was merely interview with Stuart. There is no significance attached to this report.

   close to Fidel Castro for the purpose of exploiting the
   Journalistic advantages of an interview. Therefore, there
   is no significance attached to this report considering that

Ast. No. 17 to UFGA 19939

SUBJECT: COBB, June

1. BIOGRAPHIC DATA

a. DPOB: c. 1930 Somewhere in US. USAcitizen.

b. OCCUPATION: Helping a fou PELLICER, write book on Anti-Communism.

c. ADDRESS: Somewhere in Mexico City, DF.

2. BACKGROUND

a. Around June or July of 1959, AMDOFF/1 was ordered by Celia SANCHEZ to pay the Habana hospital bill of an American named June COBB. The bill, which A/1 recalls, $20,000.00 plus Habana Hilton Hotel expenses, were paid out of the PM's office account. A/1 believes that Miss COBB became acquainted with Fidel and Sanchez on their US trip of April-May 1959, but ignores the details. Sanchez instructed A/1 to employ Miss COBB in the press section of the PM's office: She was responsible with seeing all American and English speaking newsmen who desired to interview Castro or requested permits to visit the interior of the island. She also helped to translate Fidei's important speeches into English. It is A/1's understanding that she had no other duties or responsibilities. She never dealt with Castro directly, but through Maria VITOSKA, who was Sanchez's laison with the PM's office. A/1 states that their relationship was limited to her official function. She appeared to have a newspaper background, but A/1 ignores the details.

b. About late 1959 Miss COBB, together with Jose PUENTE Blanco, then FEU (Federacion Estudiantis Universitaria) president of the University of Habana, in conjunction with the INIT (Instituto Nacional de Industrias Turisticas), took over a finca (formerly owned by Batista) near-Ceiba del Agua, Habana, and setup a boarding house to be used by American students visiting Cuba as guests of the government. A/1 ignores the details of this operation.

c. By mid 1960 A/1 learned that Miss COBB had left for New York City. She never returned. A/1 claims he does not know why she made this decision.

d. When A/1 arrived in Mexico late October 1964, he came to know an American writer, Daniel JAMES (address: Vicente Gomez #145, Mexico City, DF. tel 40-19-71). James told A/1 that Miss COBB had recently been deported from Guatemala and was living in Mexico City. Later, A/1 met Miss COBB accidently at the Mexican Ministerio de Gobernacion offices. She was very friendly and said she was helping a PELLICAR (believed by A/1 to be a Guatemalan) to write a book describing his defection from Communism. She wanted A/1 to help Pellicer with reference material on the Marcos RODRIGUEZ trial. She gave A/1 her address, but for various reasons he said he swore up the slip.

2 SECRET

1/1 claims he did not want to be associated with her while his political position is still under investigation and further, he did not want his wife to find any feminine references on his person when she arrived. He has not seen Miss COBB again.

. (It should be pointed out that A/1 did not include her name on the original roster of the personnel of the PM's office. He remembered her participation when directed a special series of questions (requested by Dave in Mexico City in late Nov 64) on the activities of US news and public relations media.

3. JHWAVE traces:

a. COBB, June: Bovlet officials informed the Cubans that Subject who acted as an interpreter for Fidel Castro was an FBI agent (201-287019, RVCA-08569; 01 Sept 61)

b. COBB, June: Since sept, 59, she has been employed in the B. office of Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of Cuba. Miss Cobb was in New York City for Medical treatment intended to return to Cuba on December 3 1959 (053-009-008; DBA 15994; 11. Jul 62; P2)

c. COBB, June: Expected leave Hava on afternoon 3 June 60 by National airlines for NY. Requesting FBI not impede her activities (OUT 81006 tc FBI; 31 May 60)

d. COBB, June: DPOB Jun 1927, Ponca, Calif., USA. Former Add" 1192 Park Ave, New York City; 220 E. 52nd St., New York City. A great admirer of CASTRO (Additional info to the DBF of the same date (DBF 40107; 8 Jan 60)

e. COBB, June: Subj; who translated AREVALO's "The Fable of the Shark and Sardines" was deported on 9 Nov. 61 by Guatemalan police, according to news broadcasts (Also see DBF 95411, 1 Dec 61, File 100-9-14) (HAVA, FBIS; 9 Nov. 61)

# Draft of Dispatch

ΑΤΤ ΤΟ ΜΗΠΑ-27461

1. LICOOKY-1 has been terminated effective 1 July 1966. The last meeting with her was held on 23 June. She was paid her salary through 30 June, her income tax refund for the period 1 January 1965 - 30 June 1966 and given money for one-way air fare to New York City. She was completely satisfied with the financial terms of the settlement. A Termination Secrecy Oath, signed in true name, was obtained.

2. L-1 plans to return to New York on or about 1 July. She said she will look for a job there, and is confident she will have no difficulty obtaining one. She does not yet know where she will be living.

3. L-1 is subletting the apartment she occupies here. She has purchased the KUBARK-owned household effects which had been loaned to her for that apartment. For this reason, in addition to the fact that she has acquired many close friends and interests here as a result of five years residcace, the Station expects that she will return to Mexico, although she insists she has no plans to do so.

4. She was given a post office box address to use to contact the Station in the event that she does return to Mexico and feels it necessary to do so. But no committment was made to her regarding any future contact or payment for information.

5. She was previously told that the telephone number of the New York KUBARK office is listed in the directory and she could call that office if contact were necessary while she was in the United States. She asked if that would still be the case and was told that it was but only to attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter. But since she tends to liberally apply importance to a wide variety of events and subjects, and since she is likely to be short of money shortly after arriving, it would not be surprising if she did try to establish such contact.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT : Request for Termination of Project LICOOKY

The L'COOKY Project was last approved for the period
: January 1965 through 31 December 1965 for $5.140--$2,530
for FY 1965 and $2,610 for FY 1966. It is requested that
the LICOOKY Project be terminated effective 1 January 1966,
based on the following information geared to the outline
in CSI-F NO. 230-60.

(1) Project Name: LICOOKY

(2) Original Project Objectives: Identify and report
on plans. activities and associates of Central
American Communists resident in or visiting Mexico

(3) Reason for Termination: LICOOKY-1 lost her accевв
to the hard core group of CA communists partly
because of her close association with LINLUCK who
publicly renounced his break with the Guatemalan.
CP in 1962. The loss of accres was also partly
due to L-1's own apparent indiscretion 15-a-vis
soze of her close friends in Mexico City. This
can be attributed both to her or growing distante
for the grubby and blindly unreasoning members of
this group with whom she was asked to consort, and
her reaction in her social group which took the
form increasingly of anti-Communist remarks, and
to the concomitant for possibly resultant) rumors
of increasing currency. that she was in the pay
of PBSWING. Attempts were made to take advantage
of her connections with literary circles in
Mexico, but her inability to budget her time,
sufficiently to satisfy station requirements led
to the decision to terainate her. A contributing
cause was also her inability to regularize her
status in Wexico so she could accept a paying
position which would give her reason to remain
there, with the resultant strain of the thin
legend that her father was providing her support.

(4) Effectiveness of Project Project supplied a certain anoint of miscellaneous detail on the Central American Communist group in its early stages. Detail and continuity have always been lacking. During the post-project period of association, after termination notice was already given, she began to be more attrative to Station requirements and supplied several rather detailed profiles of controversial persons in the intelloc- tual world who could be of operational interest to the Station.

(5) Date of Terzination: 1 January 1966

(6) Status of commitments:

a. LICOOKY-1: This Contract Agent is being carrted under LIRANCH (00A) from 1 January through June 1900 10 pepar ομονοί against non-LICOOKY Project objectives. Termination costs will be borne by Project LIRANCH,

b. LICOOKY-2: LICOOKY-2 wau terminated on 31 December 1965 for lack of continuous prodис- tion. He was very understanding when told of the termination and recognized that his limited and occasional access made a regular salary illogical. Contact 15 mainiained with his via a letter box through which he can indicate his need for case officer con- tact. He is then paid small suns for travel information supplied.

(7) Disposition of funds, material and personnel:

There are no funds or material to be disposed of. LICOOKY-1 is being terminated effective 30 June 1966. At this time she will be supplied with air fare from Mexico City to New York and paid the income tax refund due her. Station owns some of the furnishings in her apartment and she has expressed a wish to purchase some of these. The normal three-bid process will be complied with in thie case, through her advertising the sale and then offering slightly higher prices for the itens. She plans to retain the apartment in Mexico and sublet it furnished so she will have a pred-a-terre whenever she returns there. Her specific plans for leaving the city are not known. The Station has no objections to her remaining in Mexico and

is quite willing to maintain contact with her on an occasional basis. She would be reimbursed out of LIRANCH on a piecework basis.

(8) Request for funds: No extra funds are required.

(9) Progress made toward attainment of project objectives: See paragraph 4 above.

(10) Review of Project: No review is contemplated of Project LICOOKY.

INFO: Chief of Station, Mexico City

FROM:

SUBJECT: LICOOKY-1/ Forwarding of Clippings and Comments Concerning Conference on Jewish Minority in the Soviet Union.

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES: Action Required: None; FYI.

1. As Headquarters is already aware, a Latin American Conference to Study the Situation of the Jewish Minority in the Soviet Union (Conferencia Latino-americana de Estudios sobre la Situación de la Minoría Judía en la 1333) was held in Mexico City during the period 13-15 May 1966. Judging by numerous articles in the press, *Política, Le Voz de México, Sucesos Para Toics* (see attachments under separate cover) and excerpts from conversations between numerous persons on LIENVOY and LIFEAT, the Soviet Embassy, the Mexican Communist Party (PCM- Pertido Comunista Mexicano) and other groups and individual Communists were determined, if possible, to prevent the Conference from welle aand, laliing that, to discreant it completely aco pin LEE ODIORE/ ODACID label on it. Despite their efforts end the voluminous adverse propaganda, both before and after the Conference, the Conference was held and was probably mildly successful.

2. *Polícica*, 1 May 1966, carried an article attacking the proposed Conference end ridiculing some of the Mexican participants (Attachment A). It contains, among other things, a partial reprint of the text of an interview or statement by Nicolas S. Leonov, Press Attachée of the Soviet Embassy in which he states that Mexico should not be drawn into the cold war propaganda battle, and he maintains that Jews in the Soviet Union are not mistreated or discriminated against. In addition to the attacks and counterattacks in the press, efforts were zade (based on LIFEAT on Enrique SEO Calev, Gerard PIERRE-CHAPLES, and LIENVOY) to prevent Carlos Pellicer, a darling cf the Mexican left but not a formal PCM member, from taking part; Pellicer is an official of the Mexicar. Committee for the Defense of the Jews in the USSR (Comité Mexicano Pro Defense de los Judíos en la Unión Soviética). *Política*, 15 May 1966

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH -2- RMMA-25207

(Attachment B) continued the attack on the Conference and its participezes, claiming in effect that it is a clear anti-Soviet move backed by ODACID. As of 18 May, according to the article, numerous signatures had been collected on a "progressive manifesto" protesting the Conference. The list includes many well known Mexican Communists and pro-Commmmists. Attached also (Attachment C) is a copy of the "progressive manifesto", which was published in *El Día* on 19 May 1966, and a copy of a manifesto (Attachment D) published in *El Heraldo*, 22 April 1966, by the Mexican Committee for the Defense of the Jews in the USSR, in which a number of demands are zade on the Soviet Government with respect to the Jews and their rights.

3. La Voz de Nexico, 15 May 1966 (Attachment E) carried an article bitterly attacking the Conference, which it charges is being organized and held by groups and persons in the service of ODACID. It specifically names LICOOKY-1, although the latter's name is incorrectly spelled, as one of those responsible for the Conference and says she is "well connected" with ODYOKE police. Sucesos, 21 May 1966, carried an article (Attachment F) attacking the Conference and its organizers and charging that there are sinister forces behind the Conference. This article carries a picture of LICOOKY-1.

4. Sucesos, 4 June 1966, included an inserted sheet (not found in all copies of this edition) entitled "An Agent of the FBI and INTERPOL in the Association of Mexican Writers," which deals almost exclusively with LICOOKY-1, her expulsion from Cuba, work in Mexico, and contacts and activities in Mexico. It charges that in Mexico she is working for Daniel James, who is responsible to KUBARK (Attachment G).

5. LICOOKY-l's name appeared in a notice (Attachment H) appearing in *El Excelsior*, 28 May 1966 by Vicente Echeverría del Prado, treasurer of the Mexican Association of Writers (AEM - Asociación de Escritores de México, A.C.), which simply stated that LICOOKY-1 is not authorized to accept duas or handle other business of the AEM within the province of the treasurer's cuties and obligations. However, in view of the adverse publicity previously, the announcement had the effect or implied that the AEMAC or members of that group believed the charges that LICOOKY-1 had a part in organizing the Conference and/or is an agent of KUBARK. The notice, as it appears, also implies that LICOCKY-1 was mishandling AEMAC funds. Echeverría offered to publish the clarification on the sheet on which the AEMAC anr.ourcement appears; however, LICOOKY-1 asked him not to do so and said she would take up the notice and any clarification with the AEMAC Justice and Honor Commission.

6. On 9 June 1966 while conversing with SEMO (Attachment I), Leonov said that LICOOKY-1 had called him to say that she had had nothing to do with the Conference, and does not want the Soviets to catalogue her as an enemy. Leonov commented that LICOOKY-l had left him her phone number and had asked him to help ber (presumably refute the charges that she was involved with the Conference). The LILINK case officer who currently handles LICOOKY-1 said on the morning of 14 June 1966 that LICOCKY'l told him she had called the Soviet Press Attaché to deny that she had had anything to do with the Conference "because it is what she would normally do." She did not, however, mention beforehand that she intended to call the Soviet Embassy. (Tape of conversation is forwarded as Attachment J.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

SECRET

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH -3- HMMA-29207

7. The Station believes that most or all articles attacking the Conference, and particularly those attacking LICOOKY-1, were Soviet inspired, and it is further believed that SEMO wrote most if not all articles attacking the Conference which appeared in *La Voz, Política and Sucesos*. The Soviets, who are probably aware of previous Cuban charges that LICOOKY-1 is an ODYOKE agent, probably felt that as an American closely associated with the AEMAC LICOOKY-1 would be vulnerable to such an attack.

8. As a result of the *Sucesos* article of 4 June 1966 an official from the Ministry of Government did visit LICOOKY-1 to check on her documentation. The official said that he did not believe the charges made in the *Sucesos* article, but since her tourist visa had expired he advised her to immediately leave the country in order to renew it, and he provided her with a letter to show to Mexican border authorities permitting her exit. She is currently in PBPRIME but is expected to return to Mexico in a few days.

9. As Headquarters is aware, LICOOKY-1 will be terminated effective 30 June 1966; the decision to terminate her was made some time ago, prior to the occurrence of the Conference and the resulting adverse propaganda. While she may be of some occasional use should she return to and remain in Mexico, it is believed that the recent adverse propaganda has impaired her future usefulness in Mexico, although many Mexicans undoubtedly do not believe the charges and others offered to "come to her defense."

10. A dispatch will be prepared and forwarded when the termination has been completed, and any new developments with respect to her alleged participation in the above Conference will be included in that dispatch.

# CONGRESOS

## ¿Les Darán Permis?

En 1961 un Comité Halú pro Defensa de los Derechos de los judíos en la Unión Soviética solicitó al gobierno de la India permiso para realizar un congreso al que asistirían intelectuales de varios países asiáticos. El permiso fue negado porque el primer ministro Nehru entendió que esa reunión afectaría las buenas relaciones de indiosoviéticas.

Trámites similares se hicieron al año siguiente en Ceilán y correspondió a la señora Sirimavo Bandaranaike, jefa del gobierno cuya política nacionalista fue saludada por las fuerzas progresistas de todo el mundo, negar el permiso, pues vio que se trataba de una más o menos sutil intromisión en la política exterior de su país.

Instituido el gobierno gorila en el Brasil, un Comité Latinoamericano pro Defensa de los Derechos de los judíos en la Unión Soviética no tuvo problemas para llevar a cabo en 1955 un congreso; éste se celebró poco después de uno similar que se reunió en mayo del año pasado en Washington y sobre el que un conocido poeta judío-norteamericano de ideas derechistas, Jacob Gastein, hizo este comentario: "Todos gritaban en inglés que hacía falta la lengua judía...en Rusia". Esta expresión fue comentada por Aarón Verge...s, portador de la revista en yidisch *Sovietish Heimland* que se publica en...

VOL. VII, Nº 146 15 DE MAYO DE 1966

## CONGRESOS

### Antisovietismo en México

Del 13 al 15 de mayo se celebró en el Hotel del Prado de la ciudad de México la silenciosamente organizada Conferencia latinoamericana de Estudios sobre la Situación de la Minoría Judía en la URSS. Convocada por el Comité Mexicano Pro Defensa de los Judíos en la Unión Soviética y con asistencia de algunos delegados extranjeros, especialmente centro-americanos, esta reunión fue el remate de una campaña internacional antisoviética, iniciada desde hace por lo menos cinco años por el Departamento de Estado norteamericano y el sionismo organizado.

A pesar de los dengosos... de humanitarismo y eclectismo con que se ha pretendido cubrirla, esta conferencia fue denunciada en su fase preparatoria por publicaciones como POLÍTICA Y La Voz de México, órgano del Partido Comunista Mexicano. Nicolás S. Leonov, embajador de la Unión Soviética en nuestro país, la condenó como parte de la "guerra fría".

Analizando, aun en forma somera, la extracción de los diferentes delegados extranjeros, es fácil inducir sus nexos con el imperialismo norteamericano y la intervención de éste en la conferencia. Los delegados son en su mayoría o han sido funcionarios de gobiernos gorilas de Centro y Suramérica; entre ellos se cuentan Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, exministro de Cultura de El Salvador; Ricardo J. Bermúdez, exministro de Educación de Panamá; Gerardo Molina, exrector de la Universidad de Colombia; Lic. Gardillo Barios, exministro de Economía y Trabajo de Guatemala: y Dr. René de Sola, exministro de Justicia y de Relaciones Exteriores de Venezuela.

A esta campaña, nada democrática y de calidad intelectual harto dudosa, fueron arrastrados algunos intelectuales mexicanos honestos. Una larga serie de artimañas fueron usadas para ella, desde el ocultamiento de la bien organizada y del puntual pago de sus servicios necesarios para la celebración de la conferencia, hasta el uso demagógico y falaz de pronunciamientos hechos, en bien diversas circunstancias, por personalidades y organizaciones de reconocida solvencia progresista.

Además se escamoteó el nombre del escritor Martin Luis Guzmán, que no apa-

Quince dias de México y del Mundo
PANORAMA NACIONAL

La realización de la primera tarea se encargó de iniciarla, por medio de una carta a la conferencia, el que ha figurado como presidente del Comité Mexicano Pro Defensa de los Derechos de los Judíos en la Unión Soviética, Carlos Pellicer. Después de disculpar su ausencia de la reunión, pues acompaña al presidente Díaz Ordaz, en una gira de trabajo, Pellicer enroló el nombre de Bertrand Russell para "demostrar" que ..."no, detrás de nosotros no hay ninguna fuerza que nos mueva a actuar como lo estamos haciendo". Y finalizó su carta con estas palabras: "Nunca como hoy sean tan universalmente de Derechos Humanos. El gobierno soviético los proclama todos los días. ¿Qué ocurre entonces con los dirigentes de tan grande nación?... Estaré lejos de ustedes en persona. Pero mi corazón está aquí y mi voluntad entera para seguir luchando por la justicia y la libertad donde quiera que la necesidad tan honrosamente nos obligue".

A continuación, el presidente de la conferencia, Martín Luis Guzmán y el que actuó como maestro de ceremonias, Benjamín Laureano Luna, hicieron sendos discursos en los que, cada uno a su manera, trató de justificar los objetivos de la conferencia.

Martín Luis Guzmán afirmó: "Pese a la revisión de aquellos factores negativos de la vida soviética y a los frecuentes cambios que en ellos se introdujeron, el gobierno de la URSS no ha restituido a los judíos sus indiscutibles derechos al goce de su cultura ancestral, a la conservación de sus instituciones, a la continuidad de su tradición milenaria". Después de algunas vaguedades añadidas a la primera, el escritor finalizó con esta: "Así, enterados de las persecuciones que hoy sufre un gran grupo del pueblo judío, cuyo milenario legado cultural forma parte de la civilización de Occidente, hemos considerado deber ineludible el acudir aquí para que esta conferencia manifieste su decisiva de protestar, como lo haría

rece entre los firmantes del nefasto "Llamado de Conciencia". Sin embargo, el literato había sido designado con anterioridad para presidir la conferencia; así lo aprueban tanto el mensaje dirigido a su nombre por el filósofo inglés Bertrand Russell el 26 de abril, como el discurso de inauguración de la conferencia, que debía dirigir Martín Luis Guzmán y que fue impreso y repartido por la oficina de prensa aun antes de que comenzara la reunión.

La conferencia. En la sesión de apertura se escenificó una farsa en la que se intentó despojar a la conferencia "pro judía" de toda implicación política, ubicándola dentro de una esfera exclusivamente, "humana". Al mismo tiempo, se pretendió dar a las delegaciones extranjeras --algunas de las cuales sólo constaban de una sola persona-- una representatividad "democrática" en las dos comisiones que se formaron: la de estudio y la de resoluciones.

# PANORAMA NACIONAL

en cualquier otro caso de discriminacio-nes raciales, culturales o religiosas, contra el régimen que pesa sobre la minoría is-raelita de la URSS.

Benjamín Laureano Luna, presidente del Frente Mexicano Pro Defensa de los Derechos Humanos, cubrió su anticomunismo con reiteradas y demagógicas propuestas en contra de las agresiones norte-americanas a Santo Domingo y Vietnam. Luego lanzó las más graves calumnias contra la Unión Soviética, y poco le faltó para poner en el mismo nivel del genocidio hitleriano al régimen de la primera nación donde se han sentado las bases para realizar el comunismo.

La jornada del 14 de mayo se cerró con un banquete al que asistieron, además de los delegados extranjeros, numerosos miembros de nuestra versátil y desaprensiva intelectualidad. Allí habló Jacobo Mondiak, gerente ejecutivo de la confe-rencia. De este seudoescritor, La Voz de México (en su edición 1829) denunció su filiación de extrema derecha y lo presentó como "dirigente de: JEIRUT (partido israelita de ultraderecha y fascista), vinculado a la comunidad judía de México por su ideología chovinista y reaccionaria".

Mondiak sólo dirigió ditirambos a la "gloriosa y hospitalaria patria mexicana" ya sus "monumentos coltecas de piedra". Después de barajar demagógicamente citas de Morelos, Hidalgo, Bolívar y Sandino pretendió curarse en salud: "No es preciso ser agente del Departamento de Estado para denunciar brotes antisemitas en la Unión Soviética, como tampoco es preciso ser agente comunista ni criticar algunas facetas de la política norteame-ricana."

A los informes sobre la filiación polí-tica de Mondiak se añade que su insisten-cia en colocarse al lado de quienes luchan

por la libertad y contra la esclavitud es la posición de clase que ocupa dentro de la sociedad mexicana. Es miembro del grupo Mondiak, que posee tal y en el interior del país. La familia Mondiak acaba de invertir $20 millones en maquinaria textil, mediante operaciones realizadas con una empresa imperialista germanoccidental de rancio abolengo nazi.

"Demandas". La conferencia se clausuró el domingo 15 de mayo, luego de adoptarse el acuerdo de pedir a la Unión Soviética que:

*   Devuelva a la minoría judía la posibilidad de llevar una vida cultural integral,
*   Extirpe de raíz toda manifestación anti-semita.

*   Dé a los judíos la posibilidad de profesar su religión, al igual que los creyentes de otras religiones.
*   Otorgue a los judíos el derecho a la autodeterminación y el derecho a unirse a sus hermanos cuando así lo deseen.

Estos puntos fueron propuestos por el escritor costarricense Samuel Gevimmy, "quien, no pudiendo ocultar los intereses a los que sirve, dedicó su exposición a calumniar en todas las formas posibles a la Unión Soviética. Y acabó por hacer una ardiente defensa del sionismo internacional, movimiento al que la URSS. En la asamblea general de las Naciones Unidas en 1965, propuso que se le incluya junto al nazismo, al neonazismo y a todas las otras formas de colonialismo y de odio hacia razas y nacionalidades.

Respuesta. De inmediato, grupo de personas progresistas redactó un manifiesto donde respondió a los organizadores del movimiento antisoviético y de la conferencia que:

*   "La relación al "Llamado de Conciencia" del Comité en Defensa de los Derechos de los Judíos en la URSS y la Conferencia organizada por el mismo comité, que se celebró los días 14 y 15 de mayo, declaramos:
*   "La posición activa contra el antisemitismo y otras formas de discriminación racial en cualquier parte del mundo, es y debe ser tarea diaria de toda persona progresista y democrática.
*   El "Llamado de Conciencia" publicado en la prensa, no sirve si a estos altos valores humanitarios. Es, pues, de lamentarse que algunas personalidades bien intencionadas y de reconocida militancia democrática y antimperialista hayan sido confundidas, prestando sus firmas a un documento."

*   "La carapa mundial que ahora se expresa en México contra el llamado sami.sco soviético no sirve a la verdad, ya que falsea deliberadamente la situación real de los judíos en la URSS. Tampoco porta algo a la fraternidad en- tre in parins, porque tiende a desviar la atención de estos de los verdaderos pro- racismo y el antisemitismo, como los pronazis y los belicistas que una vez más, levantan cabeza en Alema- nia oxidanal y en los Estados Unidos.
*   "Los judíos en la URSS gozan en la actualidad de los mismos derechos y tie- ... ...mas ocucaciones que los de- más ciudadanos soviéticos en los campos económico, social, político y religioso.

*   "Los hoy gratuitos defensores de la cultura india en la URSS siempre han combarido y difamado esa cultura, por- qué como la cultura de los demás pue- blos soviéticos, su forma es racional y su contenido socialista. ¿Cómo pueden ex- plicar parados defensores su nega- tiva a dialogar, en el pasado y el presen- te, con las representantes mis sobresalien- tes de esa cultura?"

# UN LLAMADO DEL COMITE MEXICANO
PRO DEFENSA DE LOS DERECHOS DE LOS JUDIOS
EN LA UNION SOVIETICA

Al termino de un examen, libre de todo
espiritu partidario, hemos comprobado ciertos
hechos que nos llevan a abrigar el temor de
que aún existe una brecha entre la situación
de igualdad que la Constitucion de la URSS
confiere a los judios, y su situacion real, en
el plano regioso, cultural, económico y hu-
mano. Estamos convencidos que dicha situa-
cion se halla en contradiccion con los fines
que persigue la sociedad sovietica, y su evo-
lucion desde 1956. Estamos asimismo conven-
cidos que la misma constituye un obstaculo
para aminorar la tension internacional. Es
por esta razon que estamos igualmente per-
suadidos que el Gobierno de la Union Sovie-
tica se nmostrara sensible al llamamiento que
hoy le dirigimos:

SOLICITAMOS DEL GOBIERNO DE LA URSS

1.- Que confiera a los judios soviéticos
derecho desarrollar libremente su cul-
tura especifica, con medios identicos a aque
los de que disponen las demás culturas na-
cionales: textos, periodicos, bibliotecas, tea-
tros, enseñanza, etc.

2.-Que permita a los judios soviéticos
practicar su religion y čisponer libremente
de los textos, contar con oficiantes y con
los objetos necesarios a la observancia del
culto:

3.-Que autorice a los judios covieticos
para que, a semejanza de las demas religio-
nes, puedan organizarse en comunidades re
ligiosas en todo el territorno, y a establecer
intercambios culturales y de culto, con sus
correligionar os;

4.-Que, a fin de evitar en el futuro toda
publicacion antisemita dei tipo de: "El Judais-
mo al Descubierto" y "El Judaismo y el
Sionismo Contemporareo", asi como ciertos
folletines y caricaturas que aparecen en forma
regular en la prensa sovietica, se ejerza un
severo control sobre dicho tipo de propaganda
racial. Dicho control sena sumamente viable
toda vez que existen en la URSS los organis-
mos adecuados para llevarlo a cabo;

5.-Que una legis...c.on especial sancione
los delitos de indole racista, velando espe-
cialmente porque dichas tendencias antise-
mitas zo lleguen a pozer en peligro ante la
justicia, la igualdad de los derechos de ios
ciudadanos sovieticos, considerando que los
recientes procesos por delitos economicos y
las condenas a muerte que les siguieron, dan
lugar al temor de que dicha igualdad no es
enteramente aplicada en el caso de los judios:

6.-Que considere con benevolencia el
caso de ios judios que deseen reunirse con
sus parientes y consages que viven en Israel
y en otros pases, despues de haber sido se-
paracos por diversas circunstancias.

Tenemos la plena conviccion que la aten-
ción que otorgue el Gobierno de a URSS a
estas peticiones, Labra de satisfacer la aspira-
cion de justicia de tos pueblos y su aciesion
aa Declaracion Cniversal de los Derechos
del Hombre. La misma contribuira, ademas,
debido a la renovación y fortalecimento de las
simpatias y lazos amistosos que dicha actitud
aporama a la URites, al relajamiento de la
tension internacional, meta que todos anhe-
lamos.

## Repudio a la farsa antisoviética

## La organiza el Dpto. de Estado, denuncia la AMP

La Asociación Mexicana de Periodistas salió al paso a la campaña antisoviética iniciada hace dos semanas por un grupo al servicio del imperialismo norteamericano que se ostenta como "defensor de los judíos." En un documento firmado por el Lic. Xavier Campos Ponce, Antonio Caram y Gerardo Dávila, presidente, secretario y vocal, respectivamente de la AMP, denuncian el carácter de la campaña difamatoria, presentan un hecho que sirve para corroborar que los hilos de todo del imperialismo y demuestran con una serie de datos que en la Unión Soviética no existe discriminación contra los judíos.

Este documento fue emitido días antes del anunciado "Congreso Latinoamericano" que grupos subvencionados por el Departamento de Estado planeaban iniciar en México el sábado 14.

En la declaración de referencia se señala el principio que la persona encargada de recolectar firmas para el llamamiento que apareció en todos los diarios de esta ciudad el 21 de abril en "defensa de los derechos de los judíos en la Unión Soviética", es nada menos que la ciudadana norteamericana June Iacob, persona muy ligada con las políticas norteamericanas que actúan en nuestro país y quien inmediatamente después de regresar de un largo viaje por Estados Unidos, Europa y el Medio Oriente se dedicó a conseguir firmas de intelectuales y personalidades progresistas, para el documento antisoviético, que sirve de base para la convocatoria de un congreso supuestamente dirigido a "defender a los judíos."

Resto de una de las "peticiones" que se hace en el llamamiento antisocid:ico para "que se conceda a los judies sovit- ticos el derecho a descrroller !ibrertente su cultura especifica con medios idénticos a aquellos de que disronen las demis culturas nacionales: textos, periódicos, bl- bliotecas, teatros, enseñanzas, etc.", la AMP dice: "... los dos millones y tercio de judios que forman parte del pueblo so- idlico olurn exactamente igual que el resto de las 109 nacionalidades y de los 11 grupos alines a nacionalidades extran- Jeras. En cuanto a su cultura especifica, tomo todas las del mundo tiende a ju- sionarse y a unificarse... los judios en todas partes asisten a las mismas escue tas donde van tos rusos, ucranianos, uz- -becos, etc, Reciben. como todos los de- más, educusión gratuita en todos los ni- veles". Otros datos que demuestran que es sólo una invención de los agentes a sueldo del gran capital yanqui, son los siguler.tes:

En la biblioteca Lenin de Moscú hay 70.000 libros en uidish y 50.000 volúmenes en ese mismo idioma, en la Schedrin de Leningrado, Los judios en la URSS dis- ponen de publicaciones en su idioma. asi por ejemplo la revista mersual "Yidish Hemland" fira 25.000 ejemplares. Se pu- blican ediciones de autores judios tanto soviéticos como extranjeros que alcanzan tiradas de millones de ejemplares como es el caso de Sholem-Aleljem. Los hebreos disponen también de sus propios teatros.

"Además de ello -se dice en el docu- mento, disponen de una Herra particular, exclusiva, a la que muchos llaman patria propia y que existe desde mayo de 1934, mucho antes de que los héroes judios de la postguerra arrancaran Israel el poder inglés... calculamos en medio I millón los judios que habitan en esa re- gión cutónoma llamada Birobidjan, la cual forma parte de la URSS y abarca una superficie de 32 mil kilómetros cuc- drados", a continuación viene mego ana lista detallada de la cantidad de escue 1. las, institutos, centros médicos, etc. que existen en dicha republica catónoma.

"Mucho más podriemos citar-dice fi- ramente la declaración de la AMP-en contestación a los errores cometidos por ese grupo de persones firmantes del "ilamado", pero lo amplio del tema nos chiiga a deterernos y, por chora..."

# SUCESOS -- ULTIMA HORA

LOS JUDIOS EN LA UDIS

## EL CAPITULO "MEXICANO" DE UNA INTRIGA INTERNACIONAL

UBLIN es una ciudad polaca en la que Hitler penso concentrar a los judíos en un hacinado como habitantes tiene hoy Tokio. En el histérico

cialistas Soviéticas, Hitler consideró que en vez de concentrar a los judíos se creaba menos problemas si los mataba de una buena vez. En los crematorios y fosas de los campos de concentración erigidos por los razis en su marcha hacia el oriente quedaron las y los cadáveres de seis millones de judíos. La lacna contra el nacifescismo costó a la URSS 20. miliones de vidas humanas.

En la ciudad de Lublin Nació Jacob Glatstein, Joven aún emigró a los Estados Unidos y se convirtió, con ei correr de los años, en una de las más brillantes figuras de la poesía y de la critica literaria en lengua Idish. Tiene ahora 70 años y milita en las filas del partido Poulé Sión (Trabajadores de Sión), que agrupa a los sionistas de tendencia socisidemócrata de derecha. Los poalesionistas editan en Nueva York el semanaric Indisher Kempfer (Luchador judío). En septiembre de 1965, y en este periódico, publicó Jacob Glasstein un comentario bibliográfico sobre Horizontes, una antología con la producción más reciente de los poetas judíos de la Unión Soviética que es criben en lengua Idish, de la que se acababan de editar en Moscú 5,000 ejemplares, número que el comentarista señaló como bastante considerable para una antologia de poesia nueva en cualquier parte des mundo, Giatstein celebraba haber descubierto en Ho rizontes a por lo menos una docena de poetas de primer orden a quienes, decía, "elogio sin titubeos porque son maestros del verbo y notables artífices de lo emotivo y lo temático... El fdish en manos de los magistrales poetas de la Unión Soviética es una creación madura que se sustenta más en un sabor popular que en la gran poesía del pasado. Ahí se ha conservado una savis popular que ha ampliado verdaderante sus horizontes". Ya para terminat su comentario Jacob Glatstein afirmaba: "La antolo gla Horizontes viene a demostrar que la palabra poética idish vive en la Unión Soviética".

Los dos primeros han muerto y el sobreviviente, Jacobo Glantz, decidió en 1963 a los 61 años de edad, cambiar el idish por el español, porque su poesía en aduel idioma, a pesar de los colegios e institutos que lo enseñan, no cuenta con lectores en México.

Pellicer, que es poeta, ¿puede creer que existan poetas con "luminosa potencia creadora", que las savias populares amplien sus acizontes, que un idioma sea claborado con "tanto conocimiento y virtuosismo, con tan original y extraordinaria plasticidad" ailf donde la cultura en ese idioma no tiene el derecho a desarrollarse libremente? ¿Lo creen así poetas de la talla de Rosario Castellanos, de José Emilio Pacheco, će Miguel Guardia, de León Felipe, o escritores que conocen los auténticos secretos del difícil y vivo oficio de las letras, como Max Aub, Alf Chumacero, Juan García Ponce, Jorge Ibargüengoitia, Vicente Leñero, Carlos Monsiváis, José Revueltas y Gutierre T.bón, que junto con Pellicer firmaron ese "Llamado de conciencia", que de tal sólo tiene el título, pues el nombre que le correspondería, después de someterlo a un riguroso análisis objetivo, sería el muy inonesquiano de "Llamado de un grupo de mal informados que firmaron porque dicen que les dijeron lo que no les consta porque no saben nada al respecto y la culpa de todo la tiene Bertrand Russel?"

Donde no aparece la firma de den Martin Luis. El ya anciano (79 años) autor de El Aguila y la serpiente y La sombra del caudillo, el escritor Martin Luis Guzmán, gusta del infantil juego de las esoon did.das. En 1965 fue él quien convenció a Carlos Pellicer para que juntos asistieran a la Conferencia Latinoamericana Sobre la Situación de los Judios en la URSS que se celebró en Río de Janeiro los días 14 y 15 de septiembre de ese año. Pero he aqut que entre las 53 firmas que suscribieron el "Llamado de conciencia", que apareció en cuartos de pla ħa, al día siguiente, en todos los diarios, en inser i por la norteamericana June Cob, no c.cn rarece el nombre de don Martin. ¿Se habla retira do arrepentiuto? Al contrario, prefirió en ese mo-

mo no salir liza porque estaba atare Coace hacía mes y medio firma, como cabeza de Comité Mexicano Pro Derechos de ics Judics de l Unica Soviética, las cartes en aque is inva intelectuales mexicanos y latinoamericanos a cor came a la conferencia que se cfectuaria "en la cit cxico durante los dias 13 a 15 de may promo y que se ocupare, como objetivota.co, e minar detenidamente el problema a què la mming r'a israchta hace frente en la Unión Soviética".

Sigin cass cartas, el comité organizador d. 1 cenferencia lo integrabaa, junto con don Lui Martin, el Dr. Luis Garrido y los licenciados Anaré Serra Rojas y Carlos Pellicer. Mas he aquf que ninguna de estas personas se presentó en la conferencia de prensa que el Comité Mexicano Pro Derecho de los Judfos de la Unión Soviética dio en el edificio central de la comunicad iscelita da (Acapulco 70), el 21 de abril ahi apareció com presidente uno de los pocos judíos (en to: qu habian firmado el llamado, un tal Jacobo Mendiak que es comerciante pero se dice escritor por ios 1 Liculos que publica en un perilico que sale ziguna: veces al año, Tuna Sicute, crgano del mis vitra Cercchista de los grupos sicnistas que existen er México.

El asistente de Mondlak en la conferencia de prensa era otro de los pocos firmantes judíos de documento, Sergio Guzin, ... ۳۰A le presentarse en los espectáculos de Juan José Gurrola y que tiene con Walter Rubinstein y F. Mondragón una oficina - Contatores Técnicos de Negocico donde se concierton operaciones Enancie 3 con empresas israelíes, privas o estatales.

Que el interés de don Martin Luis era muv grande lo prueba el hecho de que fue él quien llevá la voz carçante en la entrevista que el comité tuve en los primeros dias de abril con el secretario de Gobernación, Lic. Luis Echeverría, para solicitarie el permiso će rigor para que la conferencia pudiera celebrarse. Y fue él también quien ocupó desde ei primer momento la presidencia de la reunića Del Prado:

El santo Eertrand Russell. El gran pacifista Bertrand Russell, tan admirado en el mundo entero poi sus protestas contra todo brote belicista, ha sido e! consagrado ajonjolf de este mole antisoviético; a él se. le atribuye un mensaje cuya autenticidad plens convendría averiguar, pues ni el estilo ni les conceptos corresponden a los de otros documentos que sobre este mismo asunto firas Russell, Extrallo re sulta que el comité haya descuidado la presentación de una copia fotostática con la firma del sabio in glés.

en primer plano el urcblema de los ju-

pesar de las grandes concentraciones de
judíos en los Estados Unidos ylen Ar

El día en que se revele la trama in-

# Un Agente de la Interpol en la Sociedad de Escritores de México

El sábado 28 de mayo, en la página de diario Excelsior el tesorero de la Asociación de Escritores de México, Lic. Vicente Echeverría del Prado pequeño aviso advertía a los lectores que debían sorprender por la señorita June Cobb, quien persona cuenta y recibo se había tomado la libertad de escribir inscripción o mensuales en nombre de la Asociación de Escritores de la A.N.E.

El 30 de mayo, Lunes de Excelsior comentaba un “servicial” ciclo de conferencias imaginado por Wilberto Cantón, June Cobb y Piazza” y que se efectuaría en el Instituto Cultural Mexicano-Israeli, A. C.

¿Quién es June Cobb? Es una ciudadana norteamericana que ha pasado por México muchas veces en la última década y ha fijado aquí su residencia, después de haber sido expulsada de la República de Cuba, acusada de ser agente provocador de la FBI. Antes de eso, y como agente de la Interpol, había colaborado de manera determinante para descubrir una poderosa red de traficantes de drogas en Lima, Perú.

Su centro de actividades en México es seguramente la Asociación de Escritores, donde ha logrado arraigar como ayudantes al ex secretario Miguel Guardia y del presidente de la A.N.E., el poeta Carlos Pellicer, presidente que de hecho ha delegado sus funciones en esta señorita “servicial” y turbulenta que ha tenido el cuidado de lograr un antecedente que ligara a los escritores de otros países Latina: tradujo al inglés el famoso libro del Dr. Juan José Arévalo: El tiburón y las sardinas, y después el libelo anticomunista del renegado guatemalteco Carlos Manuel Pellicer.

En la secretaría de Gobernación June Cobb figura como corresponsal extranjera, lo que le daría derecho a pertenecer al Club de Corresponsales Extranjeros que tiene su sede en el hotel Hilton, y no a una asociación nacional como lo descritores. Que tiene su sede en esa especie de multifamiliar de grupos de periodistas e intelectuales que es el Club de Periodistas de México.

June Cobb conoce muy bien los círculos culturales mexicanos, pues ha buscado amistad con pintores, escritores, actores, músicos y demás especialistas en la creación artística. ¿Qué misión vino a cumplir en nuestro país? Se sabe que trabaja a las órdenes del periodista Daniel James, responsable en la Agencia Central de Inteligencia de esa oficina cuya función consiste en penetrar en los círculos intelectuales, tanto de los Estados Unidos como de otros países, usando como fachada supuestos encargos de investigaciones para universidades estadounidenses.

Si en el Perú la señorita Cobb pudo decirle a la Interpol “misión cumplida”, según van las cosas, en México el reporte ante su jefe Daniel James y la Agencia Central de Inteligencia no será tan escueto ni tan brillante. En el cálculo de probabilidades que en torno a este extraño personaje hicieron las organismos de penetración y proselitismo de los Estados Unidos no tuvieron en cuenta que para moverse entre intelectuales no sólo hay que ser simplemente inteligente, como lo es la señorita Cobb, sino que, además y también, hay qué ser intelectual, trabajar como intelectual, dormir y pensar como intelectual. Y resulta que la señorita Cobb trabaja, piensa, actúa y hasta duerme como agente secreto, aunque indiscreto.

No deja de llamar la atención el que por segunda vez aparezca en el Instituto Cultural Mexicano-Israeli, ahora ciclo de conferencias. ¿Qué pregunta con el teatro en México?”, que “imaginaron” ella y Luis Guillermo Piazza y cobrando Wilberto Cantón, secretario de actividades teatrales de la Asociación de Escritores de México. Antes fue la Conferencia Latinoamericana sobre la situación de los Judios en la URSS, en cuya preparación mostróse muy activa la directora cultural del Instituto, Susana Gamboa, quien trató de que algunos grandes periódicos dedicaran sus suplementos culturales al tema de la “discriminación” de los judíos en la Unión Soviética, maniobra provocadora de la cual SUCESOS ha informado ampliamente.

Aunque la cultura de ahora adorna y es agradable, ¿a qué pensar de que a partir del ingreso de Sara Susana Lobowitz (verdadero nombre de Susana Gamboa) el Instituto Cultural Mexicano-Israeli haya incrementado una serie de actividades que exceden la función específica de tales institutos, que es el intercambio cultural.

El Instituto Cultural Mexicano-Israeli opera como una Dirección de Difusión Cultural e como un Insituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, y no se percibe en sus programas (como ocurre con el Instituto Mexicano Norteamericano, o con el Angla Mexicano, o el Francés para la América Latina, o el de Intercambio Cultural Mexicano-Ruso) el interés o la intención de divulgar en México los valores tradicionales y las conquistas actuales de la muy antigua y a la vez muy joven cultura Israeli.

La bohemia en tanto camo que ha cundido en cierto sector de la intelectualidad mexicana ha sido buen caldo de cultivo para ei planecito Camelot que puramente trae en cartela la “servicial” June Cobb. Quizá no esté muy lejano el momento en que figuras, tan respetadas como Francisco Monterde. Salvador Novo. Héctor Azar. Celestino Gorostiza. Luis Reyes de la Maza Carlos Solórzano y otros se pregunten alarmados qué intereses culturales pueden compartir con un brillante y dinámico agente femenino de la Interpol, la FDI y la ACI.

When the proposed amendment to the LIREAM Project involving LICOOKY was turned down, we informed her on her return to Mexico that we could no longer justify the continued association at the present rate. As she could regularize her status here and obtain working papers, we would be more than happy to conclude a new arrangement with her. She felt there was little chance of this, and we then told her we would conclude our arrangement with her sometime in the summer. As indicated in paragraph 2 of the attachment, the date has now been established as 30 June, at which time all outstanding financial arrangements with her will be terminated and she will be given her air fare to New York.

2. Unfortunately, LICOCAT-1 seems to be incapable of realizing which side her bread is buttered on, at least here in Mexico. She cannot parcel her time out to her various interests, and therefore finds all her time taken up by her unpaid ALMAC duties. The profiles we have been harping on have not materialized except for the one submitted under HIMA-28831. We still hope for one on Francisco VILLAGRAN Kramer and such of the Mexican literary figures as amount in her judgment to "non-pignies." We are not sanguine. We are still after a copy of Osegueda's paper on university reform.

3. The advance made her at Headquarters is being held over her as an inducement to give us the balance of her time before departure and finish in a blaze of activity. If she does this, we will write off the advance here. If she does not, $195 of the advance will be counted as her February salary, $18 as travel expenses from New York to Washington and the remainder will be written off.

4. Rather than go through the formality of a project amendment as per HMW-14517, Station would prefer merely to consider the project as terminated as of 31 December 1966 and pick up subsequent costs in LIPANCH. A formal project termination will be submitted in the near future.

# LICOOKY Project Progress Report
1 October 1965 - 30 April 1966

1. Production

a. LICOOKY-1 has continued to devote the bulk of her time to the Mexican Writers' Association (AEM). She continues to handle most of its administrative work. She also organizes and does most of the work on the majority of the projects or activities which the AEM sponsors.

b. L-1 continued to report on efforts to establish the Latin American Writers' Community (CLE), including the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile. She reported on the steps taken by Mario Monteforte Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967 Congress in Mexico and on the AEM's probable role in helping organize that Congress.

c. L-1 supplied information on reactions among the Central American community in Mexico to the Guatemalan election campaign and results.

d. She maintained contact with and reported on individuals of interest to the Station, including Monteforte Toledo, Carlos Pellicer Cámara, Manuel Germán Parra, Francisco Villagran Kramer, and Raúl Osegueda Pelala.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

e. LICOOKY-2 continued to report travel of Communists or leftists from Central America to Eastern Europe. During this period he reported on eight such travelers.

2. Operations

a. L-1 has been notified that she will be terminated effective 30 June. She has been given the following requirements to be fulfilled before that date.

Provide profiles on the personality and politics of significant Mexican and Central American intellectuals with whom she is acquainted.

Obtain information on the newly-formed Latin American Writers' Community, its probable political development, and progress toward the holding of its scheduled meeting in Mexico City in January 1967.

Obtain a copy of the analysis written by Raúl Osegueda Pelala of the problems of authonomous universities.

Special tasks such as reporting on the activity of Stasia Madrigal and on the UNAM student strike.

b. In order to accomplish the above tasks in the short time remaining, L-l will be forced to curtail her ac-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

tivities at the AEM. There are enough jobs that need doing at AEM to occupy her full-time and therefore the immediate partial withdrawal from AEM work is a prerequisite to the accomplishment of these assignments.

c. Because L-l has played such a key role in all AEM activities, and therefore in determining the direction and scope of these activities, her sudden withdrawal could result in important changes within AEM. Any major change in direction by AEM would probably become predictable once the identity of the person or persons who will move in to fill the vacancy left by L-l become known. By having L-l step aside now, rather than waiting until she is ready to leave Mexico, she may then be able to provide Station with an accurate account of any change resulting from her withdrawal.

d. L-2 has not been met regularly since 25 January. On that date he was given a mailing address which he uses to request a meeting only if he has information to report. L-2 is paid on a piece-rate basis for information supplied and does not receive a regular salary.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

3. Security

No change.

4. Personnel

Handling of LICOOKY-1 was taken over by Gary H. Reyaander, from Howard T. Etsinger, on 12 January 1966.

5. Plans

a. See paragraph 2a above.

b. It is possible that L-2 will, in the very near future, lose access to the travel information which he has been reporting, because he is being given new responsibilities in the office where he works. L-2 is intelligent, conscientious, and well-motivated. If he does lose his present access, the Station will consider him for other assignments in which he could be useful.

PROCESSING ACTION: XX

1.  Attached, at long last, is LICOOKY-1's profile on Subject. While it is not as penetrating as it might be, it is better than we had expected. It is unfortunate that "Janet" is not available to query about the material allegedly turned in following L-1's return from Venezuela, since she is so in-.

2.  This is the first of a series of profiles we hope L-1 can get around to preparing before she leaves Mexico.

3.  L-1 has been instructed to do her best to obtain Subject's manuscript on university reform, which is now in the hands of someone at the UNAM press. This could be a highly popular subject in the train of the current trouble at the UNAM.

4.  No indexing is requested here since nothing of substance is said about anyone except subject.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI Staff

SUBJECT: Alleged Planned Travel to Cuba of Estel Sakolowska

1. On 7 February LICOOKY-1 told the writer that Estel Sakolowska, a long-time acquaintance, had told her that she is planning a trip to Cuba. Sakolowska is now married to Mario Madrigal, a Costa Rican medical doctor who is now in Cuba. Sakolowska told LICOOKY-1 that she is now in the pro- cess of obtaining a (U.S.) passport for her child so that they can travel together to Cuba. This is her child's first passport. Her explanation for requesting the passport is for making a trip to Costa Rica. Sakolowska claims that the passport application is now in the State Department "Security Section".

2. Sakolowska also told LICOOKY-1 that the "Prensa Latina Bureau Chief" had proposed to her an apparent intel- ligence mission to accomplish enroute to Cuba. She believes this mission is to take place in Miami. LICOOKY-1 reported that on 7 February Sakolowska had a luncheon engagement with "someone" at the United Nations and speculates it may be to pick up a package to take to someone in Cuba. LICOOKY-1 further speculates that this may only be a gift to someone in Cuba.

3. LICOOKY stated that she had no additional information. It should be noted, however, that this item was given in a last minute rush just prior to her departure from the writer. LICOOKY-1 expects to be in New York until the end of February.

4. LICOOKY-1 states that Sakolowska has been a long-time "left winger". LICOOKY-1 reported earlier on Sakolowska and her connections with revolutionaries in Central America and Havana in dispatch HMMA 27924 dated 21 September 1965 pages 4 and 6. This office is planning no further action on this matter and in line with the writer's telephone conversation with Frank Hughes of the CI Staff today, we understand your office will be coordinating the Subject with the FBI and State Department.

INFO: WH/C Attention: Mr. Castoro

SUBJECT: Alleged Planned Travel to Cuba of Estelle Sokolowska

REFERENCE: Memo, Sane Subject, Dated 8 February 1936

1. On 22 February LICOOXY-1 told me that the referenced Pronsa Latina correspondent, according to Sokolovska, had just advised her she would receive $500 operational expenses for the alleged intelligence assignment in the Hiami area and *mal neconnable to Cuba. This information was passed orally to your office 23 February.

2. On 28 February LICOOKY-1 told me that while visiting with Sokolowska in New York on 23 February teo FBI agents called at the Sokolovska apartment and intervieved Sokolovska about her intended travel to Caba. According to L-1 the agents warned Sokolowska that she would be in serious trouble if she attempted such trip. The interview went on about three hours during which tine L-1 remained in Sokolowska's apartment, motives in the living room and sonetizes in the kitchen where the interview reportedly was taking place. L-i stated that as a result of the warning by the FBI agents Sokolovska later told L-1 she would not make the trip.

3. Presumably the FBI, if the above story is accurate, had reason for this reported action even though from the limited information available, from L-1, there would seen a possibility of other more profitable courses of action.

4. L-1 states that Sokolowska had heard that her husband, now in Cuba, was living in Sokolowska's house and with a nurse to whom he was (engaged). It was partially for this reason Sokolovska wished to visit Cuba at this time.

5. This office is taking no further action on this natter unless so requested and suggests that addressees coordinate any planned advice on this matter to the Bureau.

SUBJECT : Rose and George SIMINOW Plans for Vietnam Conscientious Objector Demonstration

1. Confirming telephone conversation with your office March 1st the following information was obtained from LICOOKY-1 in Washington on February 28th:

Rose SIMINOW, 382 Central Park West, New York City, long-time communist and contact of LICOGKY-1, told -1 at several meetings during February that she was making plans for a demonstration against the son, George, discharged about September 65 from the military after active duty in Panama, expected to be recalled for active duty in Vietnam as a member of a military reserve unit. It is planned that if recalled George will refuse induction as a conscientious objector and mass demonstrations will be promoted in New York. Rose has had discussions with a "constitutionalist lawyer", one Boudin, to handle the expected court trial. Boudin's secretary, Teresa, is a friend of Rose. Rose plans to pay the initial attorney fees after which she will launch a national drive to raise funds. According to Rose, Boudin is "swamped" with similar cases. Rose is employed by Wolf Popper Jones Ross and Wolf. She has been a secretary for ten to fifteen years.

2. This office is taking no further action on this report unless so requested. Please advise if this matter is turned over to the FBI or any other action taken.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/Staff

ATTENTION: Mr. Frank Hughes

INFORMATION: WH/C, Mr. John Castoro
CWE/FI

SUBJECT: Alleged Planned Travel to Cuba of Estelle SOKOLOWSKA

SOURCE: LICOCKY-1

REFERENCE: Memoranda, same subject, dated 8 February and 1 March 1966.

1. Further to references, the writer again saw LICOCKY-1 in New York on 8 March. In that this new information clarifies and elaborates on the whole story obtained during the course of the last month.

2. SOKOLOWSKA's husband, a Costa Rican medical doctor, by the name of Mario MADRIGAL, is now in Cuba with a profitable job and living in a house assigned to him with a Cuban nurse with whom he is "engaged." Subject is desirous of returning to Cuba in that she admires CASTRO and what she believes he is doing for Cuba, and wishes to assist in the "cause." She gained this impression during her stay in Cuba in the early 60's, at which time she personally met CASTRO and was befriended by him. Her desire to return is also influenced by the need to care for her two children and she plans to move in with her husband from whom she expects support. She no longer has any love for her husband. In New York Subject stays with her mother, a not too well informed Polish peasant immigrant.

3. An as yet unidentified Cuban UI representative in NY visited Cuba during the 1965 Xmas holidays. While there he had one meeting with Subject's husband and upon returning to NY delivered a letter from the husband to Subject. From this first meeting, Subject was gradually drafted by the Cuban UI representative (hereafter referred to as CUIS rep) for intelligence purposes.

4. This culminated in Subject's departure from New York on the Atlantic Seaboard "Champion" train on 7 March for Miami. On 5 or 6 March, before her departure, the CUIS rep gave Subject a written list of questions to be used for cultivating and gaining the confidence of Cuban exiles in the Miami area to learn more about their organisational design and plans for work against Cuba.

Subject's cover for this assignment is to gather material for a book she plans to write on the Cuban Revolution. The questions themselves are not intelligence requirements and reputedly are along the lines of "what was your role in the invasion attempt? Why did your particular sortie fail? etc." Pertinent here, however, is that the CUIS rep told Subject that he is very interested in the "Municipalidades" organizational development by the Cuban exiles. He said this was the smartest thing the exiles have done. Source stated that she understands the exile community has regrouped into cell organizations so that exiles from the same community from their homes in Cuba now form the individual cells. In this fashion they can better protect themselves from penetration and will be a better informed and cohesive group. Subject was given $550. for the Miami trip expenses. Source saw the money. Subject plans to spend two or three weeks on this mission and then return to NY to report to the CUIS rep.

5. Subject is taking her two children with her to Miami and is taking along a "babysitter." Subject had wanted to take a Puerto Rican girl but because she could not obtain a leave of absence from her job, the P2 girl's brother is serving as babysitter. He is described as being in his early twenties and is a supporter of CASTRO. Subject's immediate problem is to obtain entre to the Cuban exiles and a easy way to live in the Miami area. To accomplish this she has re-established contact with a former acquaintance and ally, one Jerry HEMING. HEMING is described as being an American member of the William Morgan group in the invasion attempt. Subject met HEMING in the Frente Sandino in Nicaragua. She re-established this contact by finding an old Miami telephone number for HEMING and spoke to a person at this number who identified himself as "Little Joe." Little Joe said that HEMING moved but that he could put her in touch with him.

6. Subject told source she was delighted at having received a passport for herself and her children and permission from the State Department to travel to Cuba with them. Permission was granted on compassionate grounds. She was so excited at this development she immediately telephoned the CUIS rep despite an earlier admonition to never again call his at his office. He said his business is strictly compartmented from other members of the Cuban UF group. Subject stated that with her passport she now will be able to travel to Europe after returning to Cuba. Source understands that European travel will be for Cuban intelligence purposes but has no details. Source speculates that because Subject is fluent in Polish and French, with some knowledge of German, coupled with her American citizenship and Polish background, she will be able to gain entre into European Bloc circles to glean what she can of their true feelings and intent to the CASTRO government. Upon completion of her Miami mission and her return to NY, Subject then plans to depart to Cuba via Mexico. She plans only about two days in Mexico. She will be provided travel funds by the CUIS rep.

7. Source explained that Subject promised to advice source where she will be staying in the Miami area. Source has been requested to remain in NY until the coming of 10 March in the hope that this information will be forthcoming. Source was also requested to consider the feasibility of visiting the Miami area to determine Subject's whereabouts. Source stated that an excuse for this visit could be to visit Dr. SHAPPER and his wife in Miami in that they are leaving NY 9 March for a long-planned 10 day holiday there. Both Subject and Source are close friends of SHAPPER so this arrangement would be plausible. In this regard, Source stated that to save all concerned from embarrassment, she advised SHAPPER not to question Subject too closely as to subject's plans upon Subject's departure from NY in that SHAPPER was under the impression that Subject was travelling directly to Cuba. Source implied to SHAPPER that Subject has to "earn her way" to Cuba. SHAPPER was described as being in no way connected with Subject's assignment nor to be in sympathy with such business. The SHAPPERS plan to stay in the Nichols Hotel, Miami Beach, Collins Avenue.

8. *Vi intimissimi* – Evaluation of Subject being naive as to the happenings in Cuba. Source said that when discussing some aspects of the true situation there, Che GUEVARRA's name came up. When Source suggested that Che may have been done in, Subject responded that this certainly was not the case. Subject stated that about 3 March one of Che's "close aides" arrived in NY. Source understands this aide came to NY for contact with the Cuban UB group. Subject learned this from the CUIS rep.

9. The CUIS rep is described as being 5'3" to 5'4" tall, slight build, small stature, tiny moustache, a "latin type" but not dark. He looks like Harold MARTINEZ, the father of Subject's first baby. Source now states that the CUIS rep is probably not a Prensa Latina rep as Subject stated this assignment is furthering his diplomatic career. The CUIS rep had meetings with Subject at least three times at Subject's home.

10. Depending upon developments by the morning of 10 March, Source may be asked to transit Washington for another meeting while enroute to Mexico. It is understood that Your Office will undertake the necessary coordination with other components and other Agencies and that this Office will take no further action pending your advice and request.

Jack,

I briefed Gaines for 30 minutes on LICOOKY giving him the full background on her bio, education, CIArelationship---from recruitment through current use in Mexico. My suggestion was that she be told to go to NY and find a job which would give her a means of livelihood as well as cover for any future CIA income. After 6 months (or some other specific period of time) it would be arranged that either we contact her or she contact us to determine what her personal situation was and whether she would then be in a position to target against selected persons of interest to CIA in the NY area. She could then be paid on a special basis for herCIA work. Mr. Gaines wanted to think about it but thought that this would be the best approach. He will talk to you before Friday.

His only question was whether we had any indication whether she was under development by the opposition---Soviet, Cuban, etc. I told him that as far as I knew there was no such indication. If I am wrong (per your and Bill Johnson's recent activity) you better correct this.

Charlotte

DearMiss Fineicch

:
Memorandum uf Oral Compitment

Reference is made to your current coelt with the United States Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the 1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.

As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deleting all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

"Effective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Government employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its implementation does not imply ir any manner the actual creation of an employce-employer relationship. Your legal status under this agreement continues to be that of an independent contractor."

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this organization. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your covert deductions returned.

All other terms and conditions of said contract remain in full force and effect.

FROM:
Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT:
LICOOKY-1 Participation in Mexican Writers' Association

Reference: RMA 26,621, 15 July 1965

1.  LICOOKY-1's efforts as described in reference have substantial merit and some potential particularly if the Station can find a way to tie them in with the LIREAM effort in the intellectual field.

2.  LICOOKY-1 certainly is to be commended for her effort in getting writers both of the right and left such as Carlos PELLICER Camara to join the AEM. From a KUBARK standpoint the most interesting contact is the one with PELLICER because he has been the reported force behind the COMES/CLE effort in Mexico.

3.  Although her assigned tasks as reported in para 7 a, b and d of the LILIM memo do not entail making her witting of other Station assets engaged in KHSPAWN Ops among the intellectuals, an amendment to her OA is required, and one has been requested. If her efforts progress to the point where she might be able to influence leftist writers in their efforts to establish the CLR in Mexico (para 7 c of LILINK Leno) Headquarters should be forwarded your ideas on why and how LICOOKY-1 should be used as an active MHSPAWN agent, and another anmendment will be required for this role.

4.  ANDRIETTE will discuss this operation with the Station during his TDY.

5.  In view if the restricted OA which confines KUBARK's association with LICOOKY-1, it is important that leadquarters remain aware of any unusual activity in her personal life which might affect her security or the granting of amendments to her Of for individual operations. Therefore, we would appreciate your keeping us informed on a more timely basis of any undertakings such as the recruitments for membership in the AEM described in reference.

LICOOKY Project Progress Report

March, 1965

1. Production

The LICOCKY Project has not produced any information reports during this reporting period. During this period LICOGII-1 has been reporting on her activities and working as follows:

a. L-1 learned that the Guatemalan PGT have approached Bartolomé Costa-Amic about printing a"news letter" to be distributed in Guatemala. When this occurs she will be able to obtain copies and identify the authors and other pertinent details.

b. Continuing reports on the activities of Miguel Angel Toralla Burgos, Guatemalan guerrilla now in exile in Mexico. L-1 has established that Toralle meets Victor Manuel Gutiérrez once a week at sors undisclosed place and time.

Jose Revueltos, Communist landmark personality in Mexico for the past several years, on a regular basis. Jose Revueltos has become an alcoholic and for the last several seeks has been living with an Indian girl. Hrs. Revueltos blames this situation of her husbands relation-ship with two brothers Arturo and Jorge Filio and on Jaime Navarro. According to Mrs. Revueltas these three are engaged in smuggling contraband goods into Mexico and are also engaged in drug activities. Mrs. Revueltas claims that they use their smuggling channels to help the PCM pass items and bodies in and out of the country. Jose Revueltas was the contact man between this group and David Alfaro, Alfredo Siqueiros and Luis Arenal who were interested in smuggling Guillermo Rousset Banda accused of murdering Carlos Farias Jimenez, both known Communists, out of the country. There has been speculation that this murder was the result of differences between the Pro-Soviet and Pro-Communist China groups of PCM. Mrs. Revueltas believes that if she could cause the arrest of the Filios and Navarro she could rescue her husband from their influence. At L-1's suggestion, she wrote an anonymous letter denouncing the Felios and Navarro, describing their activities, types of contraband the addresses where the contraband was located. Mrs. Revueltas was told by L-1 she would give it to a friend of hers on the Narcotics Board in Mexico.

The letter was passed to the Station where it will reach the proper Mexican authorities. This may not work, but if the information provided by Mrs. Revueltos is true and the group is arrested, publicity plus additional help from the stations publicity can create a damaging scandal against the PCM.

L-1 has been additionally instructed of the requirements outlined in para 2 of Ref. 3.

LICOOKY-2 reported on 15 March that Judith Ferreto called him to send a ticket to San Jose, Costa Rica for *Manuel Mora* or to the person to whom he assigns it. The ticket was for travel from San Jose to Mexico City. On March 18 Ferreto called saying *Mora* was in the city and had not used the ticket but had given it to Señora Carmen Lopes de Ferreto who travelled to Mexico on 21 March. Ferreto called again on 26 March making a reservation for Carmen de Ferreto's return to San Jose on 1 April.

L-2 took advantage of this phone call to remark to Ferreto that there had been little travel lately. She told him there was no explanation other than people were just not travelling. She said she expected there would be some movement of students this summer.

2. Operations

I In order to better control and guide L-1's work, two steps have been taken. Discussions with L-1 have been directed toward blocking out and defining the goals she should achieve during the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 186

next three months period. For each meeting she prepares an "activities report". In this report she outlines her activities for the preceeding week, the tasks she was working on, the people she was in contact with are the results. She also lists the tasks she will work on during the coming seek, the people she will see, etc.

L-1 is handicapped in this work since she has no control over her contacts and has to be extremely discreet in her elicting of the facts. Many times her plans go awry since during a given conversation there is no opening to iring up the subject she wished to discuss.

3. Security

Both LICO KY-1 and-2 appear to recognize the security impli- cations of their work. Deither are curious about their case officers. They follow their instructions concerning the security of their meetings and coumo with their case officers. During the reporting period their has been no evidence of any unusual security problems.

4. Personnel

LICOOKY-1 has regained her good health and her morale is high. How that she has a permanent base of operations, in that she has her apartment furnished and a telephone, she is resuming her regular contacts that were broken when she was ill and living in a series of differunt locations.

During the present case officer's contact with L-1, she has not presented the personality described in Para 3 of Ref B. She

is an intelligent woman, and in all our meetings she has appeared
mature and attentive. She has been prompt and reliable in her
meetings. She discusses her problems calmly and accepte instruction
and criticism without argument. She has responded well to instruct-
ions and has worked hard in trying to improve her reporting. She
appears to be well adjusted to her environment which is most ex-
tremely trying at times.

In discussions concerning the Communist and leftist movements,
she adzitted that at one time she was influenced by their ideology.
but as she had grown older and had observed more of their activities
and personalities, she had lost all respect for them. She said that
she had been fooled by Fidel Castro in his early days and had
thought he would be good for Cuba, but as events have developed
she has seen how mistaken she had been originally. She also commented
that in long talks with LINLUCK, he had opened her eyes to the
fallacy of the Communist ideology. In all of these conversations
she has appeared sincere in her statements. Her liason with LINLUCK
appears to be based on deep affection for him and not on prozia-
cuity. The case officer has the impression that if there was not
a present Mrs. LINLOCK she would become legally his wife. This is
a problem that may have to be faced in the future.

LICOOKY-2 doesn't present any personnel problem. While his
niche is a emall one and his access is limited, his assignments
are carried out conscientiously.

5. Problems

LICOOKY-2 admitted the access to her communist contacts here had been hurt as a result of her known association with LINLUCK at the time he publicly broke with the party. As an example of this, Miguel Toralla told her that Gutierrez had referred to LINLUCK and LICOOKY-1 as "enemies" of the party and that he had been reprimanded for seeing LINLUCK when he first arrived in town. He had been forbidden to see either one of them.

## 6. Effectiveness

LICOOKY-1's target studies and suggestions on possible recruitment approaches have been helpful. While her reporting for the past month has not produced any Information Reports, it has kept the station aware of the activities in her particular area of access.

If she is successful in performing her tasks as outlined in the paragraph under "Production" above, such information will be useful to the station. LICOOKY-2's effectiveness is limited to his narrow target, but such travel information that he does provide does serve a useful purpose.

## 7. Plans

It is planned to continue the present direction and guidance given to LICOOKY-1 in an effort to increase the quantity and quality of her production.

The same attention will be given to LICOCKY-2.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Retirement - James W. McCord, Jr.

1. The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of a memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retirement will be recommended to the Director under the provisions of the CIA Retirement and Disability System pertaining to involuntary retirement, in no way implies an adverse action. Subject signed an application for retirement of his own volition in order to qualify for an immediate retirement annuity. The liberalized criteria for such separations was established by the Agency to parallel similar actions under the Civil Service Retirement System in accordance with FPM Letter No. 831-23, dated 10 December 1969.

2. Any inquiry received concerning the nature of the separation of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed simply as a retirement.

SUMMARY OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT

JAMES W. MCCORD, JR.

Service with the Central Intelligence Agency began on 22 August 1951 and continued through-31 August 1970. During his career there was a variety of assignments involving investigations, research and report writing, technical and physical security programs and a two year tour overseas.

As an investigator during the first two years of employment, there was wide involvement in a variety of support activities requiring initiative and ingenuity.

During the seven years engaged in research and report writing, there was much independence of action and success depended on initiative, imagination and resourcefulness in pioneering new areas of interest. Beginning in May 1957, managerial responsibilities began with appointment to a Deputy Chief position of a research staff of some six professional and clerical personnel.

When serving overseas, responsibilities were managerial in nature as Chief of a regional staff of some ten professional and clerical personnel providing a full spectruin of security support.

From August 1964 to June 1965 he attended the Air War College as representative of the Agency.

Since 1965 two vital line positions were held involving the Agency's programs in the technical and physical security fields.

In heading up the technical security division, from 1965 to 1963, he had primary supervisory responsibility for some 40 professional and clerical personnel, preparing the budget and programs for the Agency's technical security program, and managing the obligating of authorized funding to assure that approved programs and goals were met. He was instrumental in guiding the development of rew approaches, in establishing new training concepts and in bringing the Agency to a position of recognized leadership in this fielć.

SECRET

Since October 1968, as Chief of a division responsible for the Agency's physical security program he had primary responsibility for the supervision of some 70 professional and clerical personnel, together with the programming, budgeting and implementing of the total physical security program of the Agency. As a result of his technological experience, he developed and implemented physical security programs which produced for the Agency a physical security posture of pre-eminent quality within the US Government.

I want to express my appreciation to you personally and through you to Howard Osborn and the other of your associates who contributed so effectively to the visit of the President on Friday. The arrangements were flawless; the security first-class without being intrusive. I am well aware of the amount of work and planning which went into the successful outcome. I particularly want to commend the good sense and judgment which prevailed throughout. It is easy to push people around. It is difficult to take proper precautions and at the same time make everyone feel as though it were his or her party. Thank you very much. Well done!

MEMORANDUM FOR: DD/PTOS

SUBJECT : Security Support During President Nixon's Visit

1. I have received numerous and highly complimentary com-
   ments from the Director, the Executive Director and the Acting
   Deputy Director for Support for the role this Office played during the
   visit of President Nizon to the Agency on 7 March 1969. In addition,
   Mr. Don Gautreau, the Secret Service Agent responsible for protec-
   tive measures during the visit, told me that he had never met a more
   highly professional group of personnel than our Security officers.
   He was impressed with the comprehensive coverage inherent in our
   protective measures.

2. Our performance on Friday was smooth, efficient and
   effective and once more is a tribute to our ability to rise to any
   occasion. This is possible only because of the quality of the effort
   put forth by each Security Officer who participated. I am very proud
   of all of you and I would like to particularly commend Jim McCord,
   Bill Wilkinson and Jim Greene for the work they did in planning our
   role in the ceremonies. Equally impressive was the performance of
   Hollis Whitaker and bis people in the provision of audio coverage of
   the event.

3. I would like to have copies of this memorandum placed in
   the official Personnel File of every individual who participated in
   making this event such a great success.

Dear Mr. Osborn:

On 8 November 1967, Messrs.

Included in this presentation was the display of the latest electronic techniques and technical developments in the area of audio threat.

This presentation was most enlightening and proved to be of keen interest to the Agency NCS Representatives, staff members of the Office of the Manager, NCS and selected key personnel of the Defense Communications Agency.

We very much appreciate the availability of the above mentioned personnel and I should like to commend them on their excellent manner of presentation and thorough knowledge of the subject matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. James W. McCord, Jr. 8 March 1966

THROUGH : Head of SS Career Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomina- tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement. Board. This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys- tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici- pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 years of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude recon- sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi- ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis- cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 6E-1319 Head- quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questions you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

Dear Mr. Hagan:

Reference is made to your letter dated June 4, 1951.

At the present time I am in the position of finding it necessary in the very near future to make several decisions of considerable financial importance to me. Should your organization be in a position to indicate whether favorable consideration has been given my application, or to indicate by what date you may be in a position to make a decision in that regard, such information would be of very great help to me at this time. As you have been advised earlier, I am interested in the CIA as a career, am willing to accept an assignment either overseas or in this country at your discretion, and at the starting salary you believe commensurate with my past experience.

Any assistance you can furnish concerning the above request will be indeed appreciated.

Very truly yours,

James Walter McCord Jr.

SECRECY AGREEMENT

1. I, _[blank space]_, understand that by virtue of my duties in the Central Intelligence Agency, I may be the recipient of information and intelligence which concerns the present and future security of the United States and which belongs to the United States. This information and intelligence, together with the methods of collecting and handling it, are classified according to security standards set by the Central Intelligence Agency. I have read and understand the provisions of the Act of Congress of June 15, 1917 (Espionage Act), as amended, concerning the disclosure of information relating to the National Defense and I am familiar with the penalties provided for violation thereof.

2. I agree that I do not now, nor shall I ever possess any right, interest, title or claim in or to any of the information or intelligence or the methods of collecting or handling of it which has come or shall come to my attention by virtue of my connection with the Central Intelligence Agency, but shall always recognize the property right of the United States of America in and to such matters.

Dear Sir:

I am interested in securing an interview with your local Agent-In-Charge regarding the position of Special Agent with your organization. My prior investigative experience includes four years with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, two years as a Special Agent and two years as a Radio Technician. I hold a commission in the U. S. Air Force Reserve, and have held an assignment as Intelligence Officer in a Reserve Unit. My last annual two-week tour of duty in the Air Force Reserve was an Intelligence Officer Refresher Course at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado in March, 1950. My age is twenty-seven, and I am married, no children.

Should it appear that an interview may be arranged, I shall be glad to talk with your representative at his convenience.

Very truly yours

James Walter McCord, Jr.

Mr. James W. McCord, Jr.

Rockville, Maryland 20850

Dear Mr. McCord:

It is the practice of the Organization to follow up with former employees six months after their retirement. We hope by such inquiry to obtain information on what our retirees are doing and where they are located, invite suggestions for improving the retirement program and to learn if the Organization might be of some assistance on any post-retirement matters.

We should like very much to hear from you on the above points and on any other topics you think would be useful to us.

For your convenience in replying, we have enclosed a sheet somewhat akin to a form on which we have listed those standard items of information we'd like to have on every retiree. The remainder of the sheet, including the reverse side, is for your comments and suggestions. We shall be most appreciative of your fullest response to this inquiry.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Sincerely your's,

Carroll A. Duchay
Personnel Officer

1. This is an annual fitness report covering the period 1 April 1969 through 31 March 1970. Mr. McCord completed his first full year as Chief, Physical Security Division. During 1969 the Division underwent many changes, a direct result of the personal efforts of this employee. He has shown the initiative to seek out new ways and means to harden the security of our domestic and overseas facilities by tapping all possible technological sources both in and out of Government. His efforts have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture in the physical security field is far superior to any of our contemporaries.

2. With the spiraling costs of manpower, Mr. McCord has concentrated on the potential for use of technical devices to replace the human asset. He has made remarkable inroads into this field by way of imagination, ingenuity and drive.

3. Mr. McCord has the quality to inspire his subordinates. He is demanding, but understanding. On more than one occasion he was asked to take under his wing employees who were labeled "problems." Through personal interest and effort, he has salvaged the majority of these individuals to a point where they are performing in a highly satisfactory manner.

4. In the previous fitness report, I alluded to the fact that employee has a tendency to find it difficult to see another person's point of view. This, I feel, is attributable to an innate stubbornness which obviously is difficult to overcome. Mr. McCord is a very


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 94

principled individual who once convinced he has hit upon the proper
course of action will usually yield only by direction. We've discussed
this, and I've noted a determined effort on his part to broaden his
tolerance for other opinions.

5. Overall, the employee has made a substantial contribution
   to the Office of Security by his dedication to his job, his tenacious
   attitude toward upgrading our physical security standards, a curious
   and inventive mind ever searching for better ways to solve a problem
   in his area of responsibility, and a cost consciousness in the admini-
   stration of his division. I rate him an overall "Strong."

12 FOR 1069

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT: MCCORD, James W., Jr., Emp. Ser. No. 058124 Fitness Report

1. This is an annual fitness report covering the period 1 April 1968 through 31 March 1969. During the first period of this report, Mr. McCord served as the Chief, Technical Division/ PTOS and continued to display a very high degree of professionalism in administering the Agency's world-wide Audio Countermeasures (ACM) program. Under his guidance, several new devices and techniques were developed which have helped the Agency and the intelligence community to maintain pace with the sophisticated advances by the opposition in the field of positive audio.

2. Mr. McCord initiated the necessary planning for the activation of the Interagency Training Center (ITC) which provides ACM instruction to all members of the community in the latest of equipment and techniques.

3. On 14 October 1968, he was reassigned to the position of Chief, Physical Security Division. Although he had relatively little experience in this particular field, he has quickly assimilated the necessary details to manage this Agency effort. He has taken steps toward the development, and use of the most advanced physical security equipment and techniques to protect the Agency. Under the supervision of Mr. McCord, the Agency Security Command Center operations have been expanded and improved. He has been assigned the responsibility to organize and direct the Security efforts relating to the protection of Agency assets in time of demonstrations, riots, and other civil disturbances. He coordinated the Agency Security effort with the U. S. Secret Service in protection of the President of the United States during his recent visit to the CIA Headquarters.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 97

4. Mr. McCord is considered to be economical in his use of equipment, manpower and funds.

5. Perhaps one of the stronger attributes this employee possesses is his ability to organize. In a relatively short time, he has deliberated the Physical Security Division's mission and already taken steps to restructure it within existing manpower limitatione to more effectively react to its responsibilities.

6. He inspires his subordinates and has the respect of his superiors. There have been instances, however, when Mr. McCord has exhibited a certain intolerance with individuals who do not agree with his point of view, resulting in some friction in their working relations. There has been much improvement in this regard, ard I do not feel it will present any problem in the future.

7. I anticipate this employee will continue to absorb knowledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate he has during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency. I rate Mr. McCord a high "Strong."

Amplify or explain ratings geven in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. McCord supervises a technical operation with considerable skill. Although not an engineer by training, he has breached the difficult gap of communication between the administrative and technical aspects of his Division. He has maintained a high esprit de corps under difficult conditions which involve the necessity of his personnel to travel extensively throughout the world. Although such duty carries with it numerous family problems, Mr. McCord is able to manage the Division in such a manner as to maintain a high state of morale. Perhaps the most outstanding accomplishments which I attribute to Mr. McCord's fine management of his Division lies in the field of developing useful and esoteric equipment in the counteraudio field. I have a distinct impression that he and his Division are considerably ahead of other Government departments in this area of activity. This fact alone is a high tribute to his management skill. Because of the success in this field, I consider him to be economical in the use of manpower and funds.

During this rating period, the Technical Division has had operational success in the overseas area. I attribute this success to the careful planning and training which the incumbent has accomplished and directed. Further, he has already shown a high degree of skill in planning for a new activity of considerable responsibility which he will undertake during the coming fiscal year. I am highly

Mr. McCord supervises his Division in a vigorous manner. He is capable of instilling enthusiasm and esprit de corps within his organization--a difficult task because of the extensive amount of world-wide travel demanded from his subordinate. This travel is so extensive as to result in personal hardships.

During the rating period, Mr. McCord and two of his employees received the Certificate of Merit. These awards resulted from the vigorous and successful pursual of a technique having great promise in the audio countermeasures field,

Mr. McCord's performance of his liaison and coordination with other components of the intelligence community, which received special mention in his last Fitness Report, is now at a status which warrants a designation of "Strong." He is conscientiously working at the liaison problem in a difficult interdepartmental atmosphere.

Mr. McCord has an excellent grasp of the technical requirements of his position even though he is not an engineer. He has an exceptional environmental knowledge and appreciation. He sets his goals high. He is cost conscious in the field involving expensive equipment, which normally is costly to develop.

MAIL ROOM

Mr. McCord was attending the Air War College during part of the reporting period. He became Chief of the Technical Division/05 on 20 July 1965.

Mr. McCord took hold of this Division with a heartening vigor and enthusiasm. Although not an Engineer, he soon learned enough of the technical business to meet many crash assignments with exceptional skill and judgment. By trying to get these assignments done within set time limits, he sometimes short-circuited a few coordinations in other offices, but this did not seriously detract, in my opinion, from a very proficient job.

While Mr. McCord has not had the Technical Division a sufficiently long time for me to judge his long range performance, I feel he will become an exceptionally proficient Chief. There was insufficient time for me to judge his cost and man- power consciousness.

I concur thoroughly with Mr. Winters' evaluation of Mr. McCord's vigor and enthusiasm, skill and judgment. I would add to this that he has demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity and leadership in supervising the development of several new and valuable techniques in the counter-measures field. However, I would rate him only "Proficient" in Specific Duty Number 6, for I believe that he has not been as effective as he might be in liaison and coordination with other components of the Intelligence Community represented on the Technical Committee. This is unfortunate, for it detracts from his outstanding performance in all other elements of his assigned responsibilities. He must work on improving these relationships and he has been counseled to this effect by his current supervisor.

Reviewer's Comments:

I agree that McCord is a very strong security officer. He tends to be conservative in his views and judgments. He maintains excollent morale in his Branch. In the never-ending conflict between economy and a desirable level of security, he usually loans toward the latter.

When he retires 31 August 1970, Mr. James W. McCord, Jr., will have completed 25 years of Government service, 19 years of which were with the CIA in a variety of assignments covering the investigative, counter-intelligence, overseas security support, audio countermeasures and physical security fields within the Security Career Service.

During his early years of employment when assigned to the San Francisco Field Office, Office of Security, August 1951 to May 1953, Mr. McCord assisted in the covert entry and processing through customs of operational personnel from the Far East areas and performed safehouse duties and related tasks designed to ensure the protection and cover of such personnel.

When serving with the Security Research Staff, 1955 to 1962, Mr. McCord worked in direct support of Agency activities abroad of a specialized nature exploiting highly sensitive intelligence source material resulting in the reconstruction of Soviet espionage networks and resolving operational and security leads affecting both the British and United States Governments. The identities, composition and operations of Soviet intelligence services in Europe prior to 1950 and dating back into the 1930's, were reconstructed. Between 1955 and 1960, Mr. McCord was involved in contacting, developing and debriefing those identified and available.

former Soviet intelligence personalities. This activity led to close liaison with British and other Western intelligence representatives involving numerous trips to Europe. This liaison activity with representatives of the British MI-5 established a direct channel of communications resulting in a continuous exchange of leads and a flow of operational data over the years of benefit to the Agency.

During the period of his work with the Security Research Staff, in which he served as Deputy Chief from May 1957, Mr. McCord was the Agency's case officer in a number of double agent cases involving Agency staff employees who had been contacted and were being developed for recruitment by the Soviet intelligence service.

From 1962 to 1964, Mr. McCord served overseas as Chief of the Regional Security Support Staff located at Frankfurt, Germany with responsibility for the overall personnel and physical security and audio countermeasures programs applicable to the Stations and Bases of the European area. This assignment was followed by attendance at the Air War College, August 1964 to June 1965.

For the past five years, Mr. McCord has held two vital line positions with world-wide responsibilities involving the Agency's audio countermeasures and physical security programs.

As Chief of the Technical Division from 23 July 1965 to 10 October 1968, Mr. McCord supervised a technical operation with considerable skill. Although not an engineer by training, he spanned a difficult gap between the administrative and technical demands of his responsibilities, guiding the development of useful and esoteric equipment in the counter-audio field to a point where the Agency became the recognised leader among Government departments in this area of activity. This leadership is evidenced by the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 143

SECRET

Section D Continued - James Walter McCord, Jr.

establishment of an Inter-Agency Technical Training Center under the Executive Agency of the Technical Division for the Technical Surveillance Countermeasures Committee of the United States Intelligence Board. Much of Mr. McCord's ideas, talents, and imagination went into the creation of this training activity which commenced operations about the time of his reassignment to the Physical Security Division.

Mr. McCord participated with two subordinate employees in the development of x-ray equipment for use by the Technical Division in detecting and locating hostile audio devices implanted in office appurtenances and walls of Agency occupied facilities. The responsibility for ensuring that appropriate protective methods for the safe use of this equipment was also associated with this development. The significance of this achievement was recognised by the Agency when Mr. McCord and his participating colleagues were awarded Certificates of Merit with Distinction in October 1966.

In his current position as Chief, Physical Security Division, Mr. McCord demonstrated his ability to quickly assimilate the necessary details of a field in which he had relatively little experience. H. showed initiative in seeking out new ways and means to harden the security of the Agency's domestic and overseas facilities by tapping all possible technological resources, both in and out of Government, to produce for the Agency a posture in the physical security field which is the equal of, if not superior to, those of other elements of the United States Government. Illustrative of this effort is the expansion and improvement of the Agency's Security Comu.and Center relating to the protection of Agency assets in time of demonstrations, riots and civil disturbances.

Throughout his Agency career, Mr. McCord has engaged his curious and inventive mind to search out even better ways to solve problems within his area of responsibility. As a result, his

Agency career is a record of sustained superior performance of duty of high value. The value of his exemplary performance over the years has often been recognized and commended by senior officials of the Agency. It is on this basis that Mr. McCord is nonminated for the Certificate of Distinction upon the occasion of his retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, OS Carcer Board

SUBJECT : Quality Step Increase for
Mr. James W. McCord, Jr.

1. Mr. McCord has served as Chief of the Technical
   Division since 23 July 1965. Through his leadership and fine
   management of the Division, he and his engineers have developed
   several new and valuable techniques in the audio countermeasures
   field. The cost of research and development in these techniques
   was at a minimum and saved the Government much time and
   money in increasing the state of the art in audio countermeasures.

2. Mr. McCord supervises his Division in a vigorous
   manner and instills enthusiasm and esprit de corps within his
   organization--a difficult task because of the extensive amount
   of world-wide travel demandedfrom his subordinates.

3. Through the efforts of Mr. McCord the establishment
   of an Interagency Training Center for audio countermeasures is
   proceeding in an orderly basis, and the first courses offered to
   technical personnel in the intelligence community will begin this
   fall. The Technical Division, PTOS, serves as the Executive
   Agent for the operation of such school for the Community.

4. In view of Mr. McCord's sustained high level of
   performance of duties and the outstanding achievernent in the
   research and development of new hardware and techniques in
   the audio countermeasures field, it is recommended that
   Mr. McCord be awarded a Quality Step Increase.

## TRAINING REPORT

MANAGERIAL GRID SEMINAR (50 hours) DATES: 23-28 April 1967

Student: James W. McCord, Jr. Office : OS

Year of Birth: 1924 Service Designation SS

Grade: 15 No. of Students : 46

EOD Date: August 1951

## COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Culture and Development.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense. In Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly assessed. Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.

Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might change his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves.

About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar.

## ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in this courou.

ΑΤΤΕΝΓΙON : Chief, Technical Security Division

SUBJECT : Security Presentation - Support Course

7 MAR 1957

1. The Office of Security presentation at the Warrenton Training Center on 2 March 1967 was extraordinarily well received. Colonel Winters, Conunanding Officer, WTC, has informed me of a number of superlative comments by those in attendance..

2. I want to express my appreciation to Messrs. James McCord, Alan Petit, and Carroll Melkerson for their most effective presentation on audio countermeasures. It was a highlight of the program and contributed immeasurably to its suссеѕѕ.

3. I'd like to express a special word of thanks to Mr. William Herron, for his splendid support in preparing visual aids for the pro- grarn on extremely short notice. I am aware that Bill worked long hours over the preceding weekend and virtually all night on one occasion in order to ensure the success of this program, while ful- filling heavy commitments to get audio countermeasures teams into the field.

4. I can be justifiably proud of the success of the presentation, and attribute this success in large part to the extraordinary team effort by the Office of Security components involved. Please extend my per- sonal commendation to Messrs. McCord, Petit, Melkerson, and Herron and advise them that a copy of this memoranduri will be placed in their Official Personnel Files.

It an cerial or marine operation, describe type and position of croft, crow position of individual, and all unusual circumstances. Indicate results of the act.

Include roference to Fitness Reports, Lotters of Commendation, or other documentation already on file which supports this recommendution.

40. From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord, Jr., Ainn F. Petit, and William M. Marcy of the Technical Division, Office of Security, conceived and developed a unique technique for the use of a small portable X-ray machine which has been placed in extensive use in the Agency's Audio-Countermeasures Program. Experimentation during these months indicated that X-ray combined with a fluoroscopic screen had distinct advantages in terms of time and effort over the considorably more expensive X-ray film and processor. Along with this, they designed an innovation in the form of a fluoroscopic cloth which has the distinct advantage of flexibility over the fluorescent screens currently available on the commercial market.

The combination of the X-ray and the fluorescent cloth make it possible to rapidly scan in "real time" large wall surfaces and furnishings, a capability the Agency has not had before.

The Technical Division has greatly enhanced the world-wide use of this equipment in that they designed and developed a packaging plan whoreby using two attache cases they are able to easily transport the X-ray fluoroscopic equipment, wall racks, and motor units making it possible to inconspicuously carry it into offices, residences, and safehouses.

These men have shown initiative, ingenuity and great imagination in the application of fluoroscopic scanning with X-ray.

This technique, much of which required many off-duty hours to develop, has greatly enhanced the Agency's capability to detect clandestine microphones and other devices targeted against the Agency both domestically and oversеля.

Mr. McCord was an outstanding member of this AWC class. As a member of the Student entertainment Committee, he early initiated the School into a get-together; ahead of time, he attended to the many details so thoroughly that the social activities were most delightful. Mr. Cord has a most friendly and direct manner of speaking with people. He seemed well-oriented toward the group endeavors. He considerately expressed his differences toward the students of his seminars, through nice amenities appropriately made as the occasion permitted. In the seminar discussions, his participation was timely and positive, constructive and appropriately introduced so as to further the progress of the group endeavor. He was especially well-informed on the Sino-Soviet struggle for power in Africa. This student's outstanding-over-all-performance-surpassed-the-high standards expected of the carefully selected members of the AWC.

Dear Jim:

y tour of daty in Headquarters, United Sates Army,
Europe will terminate in late ay when I leave Europe to
undertake new duties in Washdoton, D. C. y association
with you and your staff has been a richly rewarding expert-
ence, both personally and professionally. The manner in
which you have unobtrusively, yet effectively, served as the
catalyst which welded together the activities of the many
staff and operational agencies which share an interest in
our national security, has been a source of continuing in-
spiration to me. Your efforts have enjoyed my unqualified
personal support and have merited the ad utration of those
members of my staff who have been privileged to associate
with you.

You have dramatically de monstrated a capacity for
bringing together key personnel of agencies who seek, in
the accomplishment of their individual missions, the real-
Ization of a common goal, in a manner calculated to pre-
serve the individual integrity of each agency while exploiting
those benefits of cohesiveness so essential to amicu.
effectiveness. indful that the application of a prescribed
technique without adding the co iple...enting ingredient of
your confidence inspiring and persuasive personality would
not have achieved the same easure of success, I unhesi-
tatingly ascribe our abundant joint accomplish .ents to your
generous personal contribution.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

My future relationships with your associates will always reflect y admiration for the manner in which you have contributed to the attain: hent of our national aims and the manner In which your personal efforts have precipitated a more significant contribution from the other agencies with which yours has been associated.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Stewart

On the departure of Mr. James W. McCord I wanted you to know of OSI's appreciation for his constant support and cooperation during his tour. He has given us valuable assistance in the performance of our mission.

We appreciate also Mr. McCord's constant efforts to create unity of purpose and action among the many security and counterintelligence agencies in the area. Through his efforts new liaison avenues were opened to OSI which, on several occasions, facilitated the completion of our tasks. His efforts in contingency planning also were noteworthy.

OSI in USAFE will miss Mr. McCord. Please extend our good wishes to him and Mrs. McCord for continued success in their endeavors.

Sincerely

2.

1. The news of your departure to a new station in the USA has been received with regret; your contributions in the intelligence community will be missed. At the same time it is gratifying to learn that you have been selected for such an important assignment of which you are most deserving.

2. I wish to express my appreciation for your efforts in organizing the Frankfurt Security Officers' Conference. I am aware that through your initiative and tenacity this organization expanded in size until all security and intelligence units in the Frankfurt area were represented, thus cementing their combined efforts into one sphere of cooperation. This, I am sure, has contributed immeasurably to the overall security mission of this community.

3. I also wish to specifically thank you for the security lecture you presented to members of my command in England. There have been many favorable comments received from personnel hearing that presentation, to the effect that the lecture indicated a very broad range of knowledge on your part and that it was presented in a truly professional manner.

4. The fine cooperation you have extended to personnel in my S2 Division has been of the greatest assistance to my command and all have voiced their appreciation and satisfaction concerning their association with you. I wish you the best of luck and success in your new endeavor.

COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHODS

The Operations Support Courso emphasizes the role of support personnel in clandestine activities and their responsibility in originating material of a support nature at headquarters and in the field. The Course objectives are to provide the student with (1) an appreciation of the Interrelationship between operating functions and support functions; (2) an understanding of some of the basic principles and techniquos of Agency oporations; (3) a knowledge of procedures, regulations and problems pertinent to the necessary support of operational activities.

a. Phase I covers Instruction on organization, functions and responsibilities of the Clandestine Services; basic principles of clandestine activity accompanied by practical exercises; project and agent management; famillarization with defensive and offensive audio surveillance.

About fifty per cent of Phase I consists of lectures, briefings, and discussions; about thirty-five per cent is devoted to fleld exorcises, practical written assignments, practice problems, and observing films as training aids in basic tradecraft.

Reference is made to the attached memorandum dated 1 November 1958, which is the summary excerpted from the report of the operation submitted on that date.

Upon receipt of information, 2 July 1958, that a member of the Soviet Foreign Office in Moscow had mentioned to one of the American Embassy staff members that the Soviets had knowledge of the crew of the missing C-118, Mr. McCord was appointed head of a team of men from Headquarters to proceed immediately to Germany to plan for and debrief the crew of the C-118 in case they were released.

At Wiesbaden, acting upon policy guidance received from Headquarters, Mr. McCord made detailed plans for the interrogation of crew members; prepared news releases and made plans for the handling of the press; arranged for reunion of the crew members with their families; and arranged medical examinations, all with the view toward avoiding publicity or incidents which might reveal Central Intelligence Agency interest in the highly sensitive nature of the plane's flight.

When the crew arrived at Wiesbaden, Mr. McCord directed the over-all interrogations and participated in portions of the interrogation of the crew members himself. He prepared cables and dispatches for Headquarters as well as the over-all report of the debriefing of the crew. He briefed the crew members regarding their conduct before the press. He also assisted in the plans for the return of the crew members to Washington, all of which entailed around-the-clock work.

Upon return to Washington, Mr. McCord directed the detailed debriefing of the crew, covering all aspects of possible compromise of security of CIA personnel, operations, and cover unit activities, as well as various positive intelligence and counter-intelligence matters. Final reports were prepared and Mr. McCord participated in briefings of the DCI, DDCI, and various Air Force and Defense Department officials.

The ingenuity, foresight, planning and guidance exercised by Mr. McCord from the time the team first left for Europe, through the initial debriefing, and then in following through in the debriefings back at Headquarters, resulted in rapid and thorough interview of the crew members, assessment of the compromise to the Agency, and determination of appropriate action needed by the Agency to counter such compromise. His performance in that instance was of the highest degree and did much credit to this Agency in the highly professional manner in which it was performed.

1 November 1958.

SUBJECT: American C-118 Aircraft Downed in Soviet
Azerbaijan 27 June 1958 by Soviet M10-17's

On 27 June 1958, a C-118 cargo plane, assigned to the U. S. Air Force in Wiesbaden, was fired on and forced down near Gendarkh, Soviet Azerbaijan. The plane was carrying nine U. S. airmen, three of whom are assigned to this Agency. They are Colonel Dale D. Brannon, Major Robert E. Crans and Major Bennie A. Shupe. The other six men were regular Air Force members assigned to Wiesbaden, Germany. The nine men were en route from Wiesbaden to Teheran and Pakistan on a flight carrying cargo for CIA. Col. Brannon and Major Crans were planning to get off the plane in Teheran had the plane remained on course.

The plane, while en route to Teheran from Nicosia and as a result of bad weather and navigation error, went off its plotted course and crossed into Soviet Armenia. There it was intercepted and fired on by three MIO-17's and caught fire in the left wing. Five of the crew bailed out and the other four rode the aircraft down to a safe landing on a small airstrip at Gendarkh in Soviet Azerbaijan. The crew members who had remained on the plane to its landing got out safely and the plane was burning fiercely when the crew last saw it. The part of the crew that parachuted was surrounded by Soviet peasants, some of whom beat and struck at the crew members. One of the men, Major Bennie Shupe, CIA employee, was taken by the mob to a telephone pole and narrowly escaped hanging before being rescued by the Soviet military.

Major Shupe and the remainder of the crew were turned over to the Soviet military, and after an overnight stay in a Soviet military garrison near Stepanakert were taken to a city believed to be Yevlakh, and then flown to Baku, Russia. There they underwent interrogation by Soviet intelligence officers, at least one of whom had served in the United States, as a Soviet Purchasing Commission employee 1943-45, and later in Canada in 1949-55 as First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy. This RIS officer, Vladimir Bourdine, later served in 1955 as a personal interpreter for Khrushchev in a meeting with Prime Minister Nehru of India. Bourdine interrogated Colonel Brannon of CIA at considerable length during the period 30 June - 3 July 1958, while the crew was imprisoned in the MVD Headquarters building in Baku. Following their individual interrogations, the crew members were required to appear separately before a Commission of Soviet officials at the Baku MVD Headquarters who questioned them about the border violation by the C-118 aircraft, and requested them to sign statements attesting that they had been well-treated and received adequate medical care by the

SECRET

Soviets. The inquiry by the Commission was perfuctory and did not involve an interrogation in the intelligence sense. The crew was then transported to Astara on the Soviet-Iranian border on 7 July 1958 and turned over to the American Air Attache.

On 2 July 1958 this Agency received information indicating that the Soviets might be considering releasing the nine fliers. Since no date or place of release was indicated, cables were sent to the various peripheral CLA stations around the Soviet border indicating the possi- bility of impending release. The Air Force agreed to alort its Air Attaches in the same areas of the possibility of impending release. At the same time a team of Agency personnel, including a medical officer, an Air Maritime officer, and two representatives of the Security Office were dispatched to Wiesbaden from Headquarters in anticipation of the release of the fliers. Three hours after the team arrived in Germany, the place of release was learned from the Soviets to be Astara on the Soviet-Iranian border, anil a USAFE plane was dispatched that hight from Wiesbaden with the Air Maritimo team member aboard destined for Teheran to await the turnover of the American fliers at Astara. The fliers were turned over on 7 July 1958, were immediately flown to Wiesbaden, Germany where an initial joint CIA-AF debriefing of them was begun, and where initial press interviews were held, following careful briefing of the crow as to the text and limitations to be observed. Two days later, two members of the crew, one of whom was Major Shupe, a CIA employee, were permitted to give an interview to the Paris representative of Time-Life. Members of the CIA team were pre- sent during these press Interviews, under appropriate cover arrangemonts, to furnish guidance to the CIA personnel.

Following the initial debriefing, the entire crew was flown to Washington, D. C. on 18 July 1958, for a more extended debriefing. These debriefings were completed on 6 August 1958 and covered the various aspects of possible compromise of the security of CIA personnel, operational and cover units activities, as well as various positive intelligence and counter-intelligence matters.

The three CIA men aboard the plane were extremely knowledgeable of highly sensitive Agency operational activities and of the identities of numerous CIA personnel, Colonel Brannon, as Commander of the CIA Air Support Operations in Europe, was knowledgeable of CIA operational activities on a world-wide banis, with many of these projects being extremely sensitive. Colonel Brannon and Major Robert Crans each carried briefcases containing classified material, and Brannon carried an address book containing several names, addresses and telephone numbers of CLA personnel and cover units. The two briefcases are believed to have been destroyed by the fire in the aircraft after landing. The address book of Brannon was taken from him by the Soviet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 204

peasants on landing and was later turned back to_him by_the Soviet--Commission members at Baku. Neither he nor other members of the crew were questioned about either of the briefcases, their contents, nor about the address book and its contents. We assume that the Soviets have or will process the names in the address book through their Moscow files. Some of the other crew members carried personal notations in their wallets relating to a few other CIA personnel.

We have received no indications that Colonel Brannon or the other crewmen were drugged or otherwise tampered with by the Soviets. Brannon and some of the others did receive shots the first night and second day from the Soviet military for their wounds and burns; however, these shots are believed to have been for legitimate medical reasons.

The substance of the questioning, treatment and techniques of interrogation has been exhaustively explored with all the crew members in the course of the debriefings. In summation, the interrogations of the crew members were superficial and do not appear to have been backed up by close coordination and communication with Moscow for intelligence research purposes. It is possible that the quick ac-knowledgment by the Soviet Foreign Office of the landing of the C-118 in Soviet territory precluded the MID from fully exploiting the crew members. Colonel Brannon and Captain Kane were separated from the group and given preferred treatment, apparently with the intention of developing them for information purposes. We are convinced that both men handled themselves extremely well and did not disclose any infor-mation concerning the Agency or its activities.

To date we have no indication that the Soviets knew at the time they interrogated the crew wen, that the flight of the C-118 was con-nected with CIA in any way, nor that they knew three of the men aboard were CIA personnel. We do believe that in time the Soviets, through Brannon's address book, which lists the open Agency telephone number EX 3-6115 below his name on the first page, will connect him and possibly others in the address book with CIA. Since the Soviets questioned him about the 7170th Support Group and the 7405th Support Squadron in Wiesbaden, it is therefore presumed that they will asso-ciate those units with this Agency.

In addition to this report, debriefings of the crewmen were taped and typed, which will total some 7,000 - 9,000 pagee when completed, are being distributed to the CI Staff and

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

other interested components of this Agency as they are completed. Questions were solicited by this Office of all interested components, in order to cover all matters in the debriefings of interest to the Agency. Careful arrangements have been made with the Air_Force_in_ order that Agency interests will be adequately protected and proper security will be maintained in the handling of information and reports derived from the debriefings, and so that no compromise of the Agency interest in the flight of the C-118 will be made to the press.

CONCLUSIONS:

A. It is our opinion that the possible compromises arising out of this incident are relatively minor in nature and that no major compromises occurred.

B. That the Soviets "missed" on the true nature of the flight and personnel of the C-118.

C. That the reasons the crew members were given an early release were as follows:

1.  Primarily, the Soviet interrogators failed to use all of the leads at their command, particularly Brannon's address book, and failed to break the crewmen through interrogation.

2.  The crew did not inadvertently disclose through interrogations, the purpose of their flight, its relation to the Agency and that of three of its crew to CIA..

3.  The Soviets apparently failed to check out the names and other data in Brannon's address book through their files prior to release of the crew.

4.  No incriminating information or material was immediately recovered from the burned aircraft.

5.  Several of the crew destroyed incriminating building passes and notations in their wallets while on their way down in their parachutes, or immediately after landing in their chutes.

6.  There were either no leaks or insufficient leaks of incriminating information through any room conversa- tions at Baku among the crew, which may have been moni- tored by the Soviets, or such conversations as there may have been were not properly interpreted, or inter- preted soon enough to tip the Soviets that there was something unusual about the flight or the crew.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

SECRET

7. The crew members were all in uniform and not in mixed civilian and Air Force clothing, which properly established their cover.

8. Sufficient pressures were exercised ty Agency, State, Air Force, and Zzecutive action a the Soviets to effect the release of the crew-as-soon-as-possible.

9. A factor that probably had an important bearing, was the early acknowledgent by the Sovie: Foreign Office of the downing of the aircraft and the attempte by the Soviets in the early stages to make this appear as a deliberate violation of the Soviet air frontier. This tended to take the "play" away from the MVD and military intelligence. In addition, this Government was stepping up the pressure for the release of the nine Army personnel who landed in East Germany in a helicopter, and the Soviets probably had no desire to create a duplicate of this incident.

10. Safeguards taken by the Agency and the Air Force were such that there was no leak to the press, during the crew's internment, of the fact that there was an intelligence connection of the flight and crew of the C-118.

D. That it is not believed, based on the evidence at hand, that the crew was drugged or otherwise tampered with medically.

E. That there are valuable points of guidance from a cover, operations, policy and code of conduct standpoint which can be gathered from experiences of these crewmen in the hands of the Soviets and can aid the Agency and its personnel in any future situation of a similar nature in which the Soviet military and RIS interrogators are encountered.

LOTION TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AZICI INTEREST IN THIS MATTER:

A. All possible steps were taken during the period immediately preceding and immediately after the release of the crew to effect the minimum of publicity and to safeguard and limit such publicity as was given out, in order to avoid disclosing the CIA connection of the flight and some of its crew.

B. Throughout the entire debriefing process in Germany and in the U. S., the maximum care has been taken to safeguard the information taken by transcript and classify it so that there would be access to the informatica therein on a need-to-know basis and by only properly cleared persons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 207

SECRET

C. Steps were taken immediately by the German-Station-after the downing of the C-113 to change the combinations of the safes and locks in the buildings to which the crew had access.

D. The three men from this Agency who were aboard the flight, Brannon, Crans and Shupe, and the aircraft commander, Lyles, are being removed from the German area, being returned to the U. S. The three CIA crewmen are being returned to duty with the Air Force from the Agency.

E. Steps are continuing to be taken to properly safeguard Agency interests and personnel in regard to names of Agency personnel who appeared in Brannon's address book or in other notations appearing in any papers carried by other members of the crew.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

A. Continue to take all possible steps to prevent any disclosure to any unauthorized persons, particularly the press, about the CIA personnel aboard the C-118, or the true nature of the flight.

B. Continue to take all possible steps to change the cover designation of the units appearing in Brannon's address book to prevent any further compromise of these units.

C. Permit no further publicity about the flight itself, in order to minimize the possibility of the press learning of the CIA interest in the flight of the C-118.

D. Carefully follow all matters relating to the International Court of Justice interest in this flight, in order to prevent any compromise of Agency interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT : Termination of Project KDAFGHAN

1. Project KDAFGHAN, approved for FY 72 and FY 73 in the amount of $11,950 each year, covered Mexico City Station's observation post targetted against the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico. OP operators KDAFGHAN-1 and his dependent mother KDAFGHAN-2, Cuban exiles resident in Mexico since 1960, wore the only human assets in the project.

2. As a result of the JMYAK damage assessment and other security considerations it was decided that the project should be terminated and the agents resettled in another country. DIRECTOR 235255 amended the project for FY 72 to a total of $20,950 to provide for the termination and resettlement of the agents. The agents were terminated in August 72 and are now being resettled in Spain. DIRECTOR 300167 concurred in terminating the project as of 31 August 72.

3. In view of the developments in paragraph 2, above, WHI/FI recommends approval of this termination request.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : Project KDAFGHAN Termination

1. A request for termination action is contained in paragraph four, herein.

2. Project KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The objectives of the project are to furnish photographic coverage of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to assist the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the installation, and to fulfill various requirements in support of other Station Cuban operations. The KDAFGHAN project encompasses two assets, KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with the project since 1962.

3. While this project may be of some value to the FBI (FBI compares KDAFGHAN photographs with the photographs of known leaders of extremist groups in the U.S. as well as with photographs of persons who are subjects of identification orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S.), it is of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico City Station. There are other means of obtaining photographs of PCS and TDY Cuban personnel.

4. In early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review of all Cuban operations in an attempt to improve their overall security. Although KDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no apparent deception, his Cuban exile status, the long period of time he has been operating his OP site in close proximity to the Cuban Embassy, and the potential (perhaps immediate) danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-2's Cuban relatives made

It is clear that the agents should be terminated. In view of the aforementioned, as well as security considerations in the JMYAK case, WH/1 requests approval to terminate this project effective 31 July 1972. In order to meet termination commitments, project KDAFGHAN was amended on 30 June 1972 by DIRECTOR 285255 in the amount of $9,000, increasing the project's authorization from $11,950 to $20,950 for FY 1972. KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2 were terminated on 1 August 1972. There were no security incidents during the termination.

The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets, KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with the project since 1962. Both agents continue to furnish information on a timely basis on the personalities and activities of the Cuban target. A description of the individual assets is set forth below:

a. KDAFGHAN-1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in Mexico who left Cuba in 1960. He has been the principal agent of the KDAFGHAN Project since 1962. KDAFGHAN-1's cover is that of a translator and would-be writer. Family holdings from his deceased father also provide financial backstopping. All photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing and mounting is processed by KDAFGHAN-1.

b. KDAFGHAN-2 (201-305604): KDAFGHAN-2 is the mother of KDAFGHAN-1. Her cover is that of a dependent mother. KDAFGHAN-2 acts as KDAFGHAN-1's assistant and fill-in whenever he is away from the basehouse.

## Changes

The only major change during the project year was the installation of a TV monitor/robot camera combination during October 1970, the month designated as "Cuban month." This added coverage contributed to the compilation of target studies on several Cuban officials, These studies will be used as a starting point for future operations, namely the recruitment/defection of these officials.

## Accomplishments

1.  The main value of the production of the KDAFGHAN Project has been in establishing the pattern of various Cuban Embassy employees. The monitoring has also revealed which automobiles the various employees usually drive. Photographic coverage of the visitors to the main gate of the Cuban Embassy and logs of the movement of Cuban Embassy personnel have proved very useful in identifying new Cuban PCS employees in Mexico. Normally the Station has been able to match movements of new and old employees during the initial period when duties and contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so identify their duties. KDAFGHAN has provided current photographs of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters has often provided positive identifications of these persons. Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters officer visiting Mexico, was identified in this way.

2.  The Station utilizes KDAFGHAN photographic coverage and logs to verify the visits of Station assets to the Cuban Embassy.

3.  KDAFGHAN also provides coverage of what appears to be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy main gate. In the case of Americans who arrive in automobiles bearing U.S. license plates, the license plate number, car description, and sterile copies of photographs are given to the FBI for identification. A significant result of the KDAFGHAN operation included a photographic of a specific individual - an old FBI target - who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation.

4.  KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the KDACOUSTIC-3 operation, an operation aimed at the recruitment or defection of a DGI officer. This coverage enabled the Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an important factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents. This use of the operation should prove extremely valuable during the coming year since a more aggressive recruitment program against the Cuban target is planned.

## Problems and Security

No agent control or operational problems have been reported. Neither were there any security problems encountered during the period. Gerald D. FAHLANGER continues to be the Case Officer and handler of KDAFGHAN-1. FAHLANGER has met and could continue to meet KDAFGHAN-2 in an emergency. The alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets KDAFGHAN-1 when FAHLANGER is not available. Both Case Officers are known to the assets in alias, and both meet KDAFGHAN-1 in a safehouse. During February 1971 the safehouse was changed in compliance with normal operational security. Meetings are generally held once a week. More frequent contact can be made by telephone. In an emergency, anyone can call KDAFGHAN-1 at his home and say they are a friend of "Pepe Simon." KDAFGHAN-1 will reply "I haven't seen him since last Christmas." KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English.

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the Cuban target in general. He has not been specifically briefed on this operation.

Future Plans:

The Station is constantly examining the possibility of an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy. A successful audio device would serve, in most cases, to identify the individuals who are photographed by KDAFGHAN-1 since they normally identify themselves to the gate house attendant. There are a few Station assets who have occasional access to the gate house, and it is conceivable that one of them could place a quick plant device, provided security conditions are favorable. The Station currently has under consideration a recruitment effort against a lower level employee of the Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous help in such an operation.

Costs:

1.  General: This renewal request is for FY 1972 in the amount of $11,950 and FY 1973 in the amount of $11,950.

2.  Source of Funds: Project KDAFGHAN is included in the Western Hemisphere Division's Operating Program in the amount of $10,844 for FY 1972 and $10,844 for FY 1973. The additional Funds required are to be absorbed from within the WII Division allocation.

Purpose:

The LIONION Project provides the Mexico City Station with fixed, selective photographic and physical surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. It is designed to provide information in support of Priority A, paragraphs 2 and 4 of the current Operating Directive, that is, the Cuban target present in Mexico and the support rendered by Cubans in Mexico to exile and other leftist groups in Mexico.

Description:

1.  The LIONION Project currently encompasses two agents, LIONION/1 and LIONION/2, a basehouse directly across from the Cuban compound, and a safehouse for meetings with Station Case Officers. The two agents furnish photographic coverage during daylight hours of the main entrance to the Cuban Embassy. In addition, on a spot basis, photographic coverage and visual surveillance of the Cuban Consulate entrance is possible. The agents also act as dispatchers for the unilateral LIEMBRACE surveillance team when the LIEMBRACE team is being used against Cuban target individuals. A description of the individual assets is set forth below.

2.  LIONION/1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in Mexico who left Cuba in 1960. He has been the principal agent of the LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/1's cover is that of a translator and would-be writer. Family holdings in


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

-2-

Tampa, Florida, inherited from his deceased father also provide financial backstopping. LIONION/1 received his "immigrado" (permanent immigrant) status in 1965 and now has a good deal of immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities. All photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping, and mounting is processed by LIONION/1. LIONION/1 and LIONION/2 maintain a log which indicates when a photograph was taken, and pertinent identifying data. License numbers of cars used by various Cuban Embassy personnel are recorded as woll as license numbers of cars of unidentified persons visiting the Cuban Embassy.

3. LIONION/2 (201-305604): Mother of LIONION/1. Her cover is that of a dependent mother. As with LIONION/1, she has "immigrado" status and has been associated with the LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/2 acts as LIONION/1's assistant and fill-in whenever he is away from the LIONION basehouse.

Changes:

During the project year, the pulse camera coverage of the Cuban Consulate entrance was discontinued. Little or no use was being made of the product from this camera. One reason for limited use was that there was no real way to readily fix the time--or the day-- a particular photo was taken. There were no other significant changes in the project during FY 1970.

Accomplishments:

1.  The LIONION production for FY 1970 consisted almost entirely of photographic coverage of visitors to the Cuban Embassy main entrance and of logs of the movement of Cuban Embassy personnel and visitors. This proved very useful in identifying new Cuban Embassy PCS cmployees in Mexico. The monitoring also revealed which cars the various employees usually drove.

2.  LIONION also took photographs of what appeared to be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy front gate. In the case of Americans who arrived in automobiles bearing U.S. license plates, the license plate numbers, car descriptions, and sterile copies of photographs were given to LNERGO for identification.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

3. The Station also used the LIONION photographic coverage and log to check on the reports of Mexican and other JKLANCE assets who claimed to have visited the Cuban Embassy. In the case of some assets, LIONION/1 was given a photograph of the agent and told to be particularly alert at cortain times of certain days to confirm the agent's entry and exit. This proved particularly useful in checking AVDIME/I's story of contact with the Cubans. It also confirmed LIRELIC/1's visit to the Cuban Embassy at an early stage in Station recontact with LIRELIC/1.

## Problems:

1. No agent control or operational problems have been reported. Noither were there any security problems encountered during the period. LIONION/1 was mot in a satohouso on an average of once por week by Andrew E. PELLEMENT, in alias. Following PELLEMENT's departure in late May, Gerald D. FAHLANGER took over the responsibility for the LIONION Project. FAHLANGER, in alias, meets LIONION/1 approximately once per week. In January 1970, the Station had LIONION/1 change the safehouse used for meetings with Station officers. He signed a one-year lease on the new apartmont, in alias. LIONION/1 uses the apartment on weekends and ovonings to lend credence to the cover story he used in ronting; i.e., that he lives out-of-town and maintains this small apartment in Mexico City for use during his frequent visits.

2. Station visits to the LIONION basehouse were limited to three during the reporting period. These were made during non-daylight hours. LIONION/1 picked up the Station officer away from the LIONION basehouse area and drove the officer to the basehouse in LIONION/1's own car. The basehouse has a driveway off the street entrance-way which facilitates entry during non-daylight hours.

3. During the Project Year, the pulse camera and the electronic equipment used with the LISAMPAN operations were removed from the baschouse, thus reducing the amount of compromising equipment in the basehouse.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the Cuban target in general. He has not been specifically briefed on this operation.

Future Plans:

1.  The Station is re-examining the various points of view which the LIONION basehouse provides of the Cuban Embassy complex in order to determine what steps can be taken to improve the usefulness of the LIONION product. For instance, from the window in the room where the pulse camera previously was installed, an excellent view can be had of the Cuban Embassy garden and the walkways between the three Cuban Embassy buildings--as well as the Consulate. The Station plans to have LIONION/1, on a spot-check basis, observe the garden area. In this way, the Station hopes to update its information on the location of the various officers' offices, the general pattern of movement and activity, etc. This area will also be observed during the night to see if it can be determined which areas are being used for living quarters or offices.

2.  It is also planned to assess LIONION/1's ability to observe and draw appropriate conclusions from his observations, and to write these up for the Station.

3.  Depending on the need for Consulate coverage, the installation of closed circuit-TV coverage of the Consulate entrance is boing considered.

4.  The Station is being queried as to emergency contact arrangements with LIONION/1.

Costs:

1.  General: This renewal request is for the period 1 July 1970 through 30 June 1971 (FY 1971), in the amount of $11,094.

2.  Source of Funds: Project LIONION is included in the Western Hemisphere Division's FY 1971 Operating Program in the amount of $10,000.

4. Foreign Currency: There is no need for foreign currency which the Station cannot provide. There are no non-JKLANCE funds involved in this project.

5. Commitments: LIONION/1 and LIONION/2 receive, in addition to their regular salary, the equivalent of one month's salary as a Christmas bonus. LIONION/1 is reimbursed for operational expenses related to the project. In the event of termination, each agent will receive thirty days actual notice.

6. Funding: All funds are passed by the case officers during the safchouse meetings with LIONION/1 who receipts for the funds on the spot. The amount of funds used under this project are not enough to arouse the suspicion of LIONION/1 by the authorities should he be apprehended. He has sufficient private income to cover the JKLANCE funds he receives.

7. Accounting: All funds are accounted and certified for in accordance with JKLANCE regulations.

8. Annexes: None.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : LIONION Project Renewal Request

1. Approval is requested of the LIONION Project for the period 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) for $11.994. Funds are available.

2. Project LIONION is a support project which provides the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The surveillance is conducted by two indigenous agents located in a basehouse directly across from the Cuban compound. At times the principal agent also acts as a dispatcher for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. Information is radioed to the team concerning the departure of Cuban officials, thus allowing the team to remain a more discreet distance from the target.

3. As reflected in the attached Project Renewal, an audio device planted in the gatehouse of the compound could be monitored at the LIONION basehouse, aiding greatly in identifying visitors. Since the time the Station submitted the renewal, however, this device ceased to function along with the rest of the LISAMPAN devices. This installation was monitored through carrier current from the LISAMPAN/LISASIH basehouse, also situated in front of the compound. Since the connection between the two basehouses was by carrier current only, and since the agents in each basehouse are unaware of the other's activity, a possible compromise of the LISAMPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

4. Although the LIONION Project does not produce disseminable positive intelligence, it is considered by the Station as essential to its Cuban operations. The 4.100 or more selective individual photographs produced annually.

coupled with the visual observations, were effectivo in providing timely operational information. In addition, over 8,000 feet of pulse camera film is produced annually, recording the image of each visitor to the Consulate. The years of experience of the principal agent have given him intimate knowledge of the target personalities. He often brings matters to the immediate attention of the Station without having been levied the specific requirement to do so. As a result, the Station is aided greatly in keeping abreast of the day to day activities of the Cuban compound.

5. In recent months, the LIONION Project was useful to the Station in checking out statements made by ESMARROW-1.

6. In March 1969, the Project provided photos of three U.S. citizens who visited the Cuban Embassy and were suspected of being draft dodgers. The photos were passed to the FBI within three hours of the request for information.

7. Other than the loss of the audio device in gatehouse, there have been no changes. The operation continues to run smoothly.

8. Approval is recommended.

LIONION FROJECT RENEWAL

## A. Objectives

1. Project LIONION, A long-term support project designed to provide fixed photographic, technical, and physical surveillance of the PBRUMER: Embessy and Consulate in Mexico City, has the following specific objectives:

a. To furnish photographic coverage during daylight hours of the main entrances to the target installation.

b. To operate as a listening post in support of technical operations against this target to complement the photographic coverage.

c. To radio dispatch physical surveillance teams against percons associated with the target.

d. To assist the Station in compiling information for individual dossiers on officials of the target installation.

e. To fulfill various requirements in support of other Station PBRUMEN operations.

2. The above-cited objectives are in agreement with the over-all objectives of Station Mexico City.

## B. Changes

Oliver D. CIMOCH assumed administrative and operational responsibility for Project LIONION in December 1967 and continued this responsibility until his departure in December 1968. Pending arrival of CIFOCH's replacement, the Project was handled by Station Officer Gerald D. FANLANGER and Station WOACRE representative, Walter W. CORNBURY. On 28 February 1969, LIONION-1 was introduced to Andrew E. PELLEMENT, who assumed Project responsibility effective that date.

## C. Intelligence Production

As an operational support project, Project LIONION does not produce disseminable positive intelligence. Quantitatively, during CY 1968, the Project provided over 4,000 selective individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering the target instellation and over 8,000 feet of pulse camera film. There he s


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

been no formal audio product from Project LICNION since July
1968 when the transcription of the LISA PAR/DOG traffic was
terminated. As reported extensively in HINA 36553, 19
February 1969, the Station has been unable to activate LISAI PAN/
BAKER since 16 January 1969. A qualitative analysis of the
LIONION product is discussed in paragraph D below. The Station
is unable to evaluate the worth of the pulse camera operation
since the bulk film, undeveloped, is pouched directly to
Headquarters. The cost of this portion of the operation is
minimal, however, since it is limited to the cost of the film
and development at Headquarters. The camera works automatically
and requires only minimal maintenance.

D. Effectiveness

1.  Project LIONION is considered by Station Mexico City as
    essential to its PBRULEN operations. It has consistently proven
    highly effective and responsive to Station requirements of both
    long and short renge nature. LIONION-1, the Project's only full
    time agent, continues to furnish on a timely basis, information
    on the personalities and activities of the target personnel.
    LIONION-2 continues to backstop LIONIC-1 and substitute for him
    when he is away from his post. At the age of 70, she is not
    able to man the LION ION base full time, and her sight is
    failing. She is able to photograph visitors, however, and live
    monitor the LISA! PAN/DOG traffic. LIONION-2's role as a
    backstop to LIONTON-1 insures continuous coverage of the target
    during daylight hours, five days a week. LIONION-l's more than
    six years of experience working on the same target continue to
    produce an increasingly complete and accurate identification of
    the staff and visitors to LIRING. These years of experience have
    developed an agent knowledgeable of WOFIRM operational and
    security requirements who will often bring to the Station's
    attention those matters which he feels are of immediate interest
    without having special requirements levied upon him and without
    waiting for the next regularly scheduled meeting with his
    Station contact. He has on numerous occasions notified the
    Station of the presence of suspect FBRUMEN security types. He
    has also frequently passed along operational leads of use to
    the Station in other aspects of its PERUMEN operations.

2.  The addition of LISA PAN/DOG to the LIONION besenouse
    has noticeably increased LIONION-l's ability to identify new
    visitors to the target and at times, determine the nature of
    their business. The LISAMPAN/DOG product was channeled to the
    LIQNION basehouse by carrier current from LISA PAN/LISASH on
    10 April 1968. Since its primary value is as an aid to LIONION-1
    in identifying LIRING visitors, its product has not been recorded

SECRET.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

or transcribed since July 1968. LIONICK-l live monitors the traffic from his baschouse. LISA PAN-1 who mans the LISASH base has been told nothing of the LIONION base and LIONION-1 was offered no explanation concerning the manner in which LISA PAN/DOG production is channeled to him. Thus a possible compromise of the LISASI! basehouse, linked directly to LIRING, would not compromise the LICTION basehouse which has no direct link with the target.

3. Project LIONION was of direct assistance to the Station on two separate occasions in recent months:

a. As a result of information received on a priority basis (the same day as requested) from LIONION-1, the Station was able to verify certain statements made by ESMARROW-1 concerning; the location of LIKING officials at specific times. LIONION-1 reported the times at which these officials ceme in and out of the LIRING compound and provided a description of the clothes they were weering at the time. LIGNION-l's information raised the possibility that ESMAFROW-1 might at least have been confused in his reporting of the times at which he met LIPING personnel, etc.

b. In March 1969, LIONIOi-l was able to provide pictures of three WOLADY males, who, although unidentified, fitted the general description and time frame furnished by LNERGO. The latter suspected that two or three WOLADY draft dodgers might visit LIRING to arrange travel to PERUMEN. The Station was able to furnish LNERGO with pictures of the three together with a report of their arrival and departure from LIRING within three hours of its request for information. Additional information wan promptly forwarded to LNERGO es it became available from LIONION-1.

4. During the past year, LIONION-l acted as a dispatcher for the LIEMBRACE surveillence team on a number of occasions. Ey utilizing his vantage point in the area of the target, he is able to redio information to the LIEDERACE team on the arrival and departure of LIRING officials thus allowing the team to remain at a distance from the target unseen by possible counter- surveillance from the target. The Station plans to use. LIONIOR-1 in this role more extensively in the coming year whenever surveillance of LERI personnel entails the team's presence rear the LIRING compound. Such utilization of LIC IC-1 should lessen the risk of exposure of the team to the PHRULE IS.

5. LIONION-1, himself, continues to provide the consistently high level of productivity that has characterized his work in past years. As mentioned above his response to priority requirements continues to be cost gratifying. He is prompt in submitting both operational and administrative reports to the Station. He is ready, at a moments notice, to change personal plans when a need for his services arises. After five years without a substantial vacation, LIONICK-l plans a three week trip from 4 - 25 May to Europe (Italy, Greece, France) and the U.S.A. lie originally requested five weeks to take this trip for which he has long saved his coney, but suite willingly shortened the trip to three weeks at the Station's request and added that he would postpone the entire trip if the Station thought his services were more needed at hoze. In order to help defray the cost of making a second trip to Surope to complete his original itinerary, the Station will give LIONION-1 a gift of $250 on 1 May 1969 and will tell him that consideration will be given in 1970 to providing an equal amount, but no decision can be made on that second gift until mid-1970.

E. Problems

1.  LISANDAN/BAIER: As reported in HMA 36553, 19 February 1969, LISA PAN/BAKER was turned off for security reasons on 16 January 1969 at 1345 hours. All subsequent attempts to reactivate it have been unsuccessful. Headquarters was requested to review all available Station information on this to decide whether BAKER's abrupt end was the result of a compromise or whether it was somehow connected with the installation of TELEX equipment at LIRING.

2.  LISALPAN/DOG: The LISANPAN/DOG/LETEAP installation is generally working well. There have been numerous occasions when due to unknown circumstances the audio reception has either been bad or non-existent. Walter W. CORNBURY and FELLEMENT visited the LISA PAN/LISASE basehouse and round no problem with the monitoring equipment there. The trouble may have resided with the central office of the ITRISK company and was probably not the result of technical counter-surveillance of LIRING. As of 3 April 1969, LISANFAR/DOG was working properly and automatically..

3. There have been no significant personnel, security, morale or administrative problems since the last project renewal.

H. Plans

1. The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONION-1's experience, training and location to provide the photographic and technical coverage cited above. In addition, the Station will continue to make use of LIONION-1 as a dispatcher in surveillances of LIRING personnel.

2. In order to check the LISALPAN/DOG take for items of possible value to other Station operations, LICALIPAN/1 will be instructed to record the DOG traffic for the three week period while LIONION-1 is on vacation. These tapes will be given to Richard C. HABOUSH for an analysis of their operational worth and technical quality. HABOUSH will transcribe them if the contents warrant.

I. Costs

1. For the past project year, 1 January 1968 through 30 June 1969, it is estimated that the total project cost will be about $16,250. It is approved for $16,632.

2. For the renewal period of 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970, it is requested that $11,894 be approved. Estimated figures for FY 1971 are provided below together with the breakdown for FY's 1969 and 1970. The major addition to the FY 1971 figures is a possible raise for LIONION-1 and LIONION-2. These figures are broken down as follows:

1. The following comments are for the information and assistance of those officers who are in the process of determining the future of the LIONION operation:

a. The ANOTs have received and reviewed a number of the prints from the LIONION operation and report that it is a time-consuming and largely unproductive effort.

b. The practical results of such a review, i.e., the identification of the greatest number of visitors to LIRING, can be realized best through the widest circulation of the prints among the AMOT staffers, contacts, and informants. This practice would result in wide knowledge of the existence of the operation, and in the expenditure of many man-hours which, it appears, could be more productively spent in other pursuits.

c. The AMOT organization currently does not have either the qualified personnel or available space and equipment to process the film as suggested in paragraph three of reference. Until they move into new quarters, un, hopefully/mid-1968, the single AMOT photographer will be working in very tight quarters.

2. It would appear from JMWAVE's experience with AMOT exploitation of the LIONION operation, that further activity in this connection at JMWAVE would be unwarranted.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WI Division

SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIONION

1. Approval is requested to renew Project LIONION for the period 1 January 1968 through 30 June 1969 for $26,632 including $15,374 for FY 1968 and $11,258 for FY 1969. WI Division programmed this activity for FY 1969 and funds are available. Funds requested for this renewal are slightly less than the previous year due to a reduction in support costs.

2. This project provides Station Mexico City with photo-graphic and physical surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. In addition, the project principal agent is able to observe and record the patterns of activity and personal associations of various Cuban personnel and visitors to the Embassy and Consulate. This effort has been of assistance in planning recruitment attempts against target personnel. The principal agent also performs functions for the Station such as dispatching and maintaining a safe-house. This project naturally does not produce positive intelligence.

3. Plans for the forthcoming period include using the project basehouse and the two project agents as LP operators in the expansion of an existing technical operation targeted against the Cuban Embassy. There is also a possibility that the photo coverage of the Cuban Consulate entrance will cease shortly as this coverage has not proved particularly useful. It is not anticipated that these changes will substantially affect the cost of the project.

4. It should be noted that the $4,800 operational loan made to LIONION-2 in February 1966 has been completely repaid. The security of this project is considered satisfactory.

# REQUEST FOR PROJECT RENEWAL

Project LIONION

Field Case Officer Cornelius L. PEUVION

Station Mexico City

Chief of Station Willard C. CURTIS

Renewal of the LIONION Project is requested for the period
1 January through 31 December 1968 for a total of $11,258--$5,374
for FY 1968 and $5,884 for FY 1969.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 48

# PROJECT LIONION RENEWAL REQUEST

A. Objectives:

1.  Project LIONION is a long-term support project designed to provide fixed photographic, technical, and physical surveillance of the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specific objectives are:

a. To furnish photographic coverage during the daylight hours of the main entrances to the target installations.

b. To maintain in readiness a listening post to support technical operations against the targets.

c. To radio dispatch physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the targets.

d. To provide for a mechanism which can fulfill various miscellaneous PBRUMEN support requirements.

2.  The above-cited objectives are in agreement with the overall objectives of Station Mexico City.

B. Changes:

In late January 1967 the operational and administrative responsibilities for Project LIONION were transferred from Howard A. TRECKLER to Cornelius L. PEUVION. No agent handling, control, or administrative problems were encountered during the past year.

C. Intelligence Production:

As noted in Section A above, Project LIONION is an operational support project and does not produce disseminable positive intelligence. During the past year this project did provide over 5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering or leaving the target installations, as well as approximately 8000 feet of pulse camera film. Information on the comings and goings of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which LIONION-1 provides in daily logs, has been incorporated into Station files and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP agencies, i.e., LNERGO. LIONION has been particularly useful in spotting new employees whose photos are then passed to LITAMIL-7 for identification.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 49

D. Effectiveness:

1.  Project LIONION is considered by the Station to be highly effective and essential... In addition to providing the valuable photographic coverage cited above, LIONION-1 continues to provide interesting observations on the personalities and activities of the personnel working in the targets. LIONION-1 reporting is being incorporated into the recruitment operations targeted against LIRING-2 and LIRING-16.

2.  In early July LIONION-1 obtained and furnished a new safe apartment which is being used for sensitive or lengthly meetings with LIRESORT-1 as well as LIONION-1. The safe site has been stocked with a sufficient supply of food so as to allow two persons to live there for at least three days in the event the Station ever needs a cooling-off site for an agent or defector.

3.  Throughout the past project year LIONION-1 continued to function effectively as the radio dispatcher for the LIEMBRACE Surveillance Team. Much of this effort was expended in estimating the movement/habit pattern of LIRING-2, a prerequisite for his pending recruitment.

E. Problems:

1.  On 27 June LIONION-1 was hospitalized for emergency surgery to treat a perforated ulcer. Since LIONION-2's presence was required at the hospital during the operation and also through- out the postoperative convalescence period, photographic coverage was suspended until 10 July.

2.  Other than a temporary postoperative morale slump on the part of LIONION-1, there have been no significant personnel, security, or administrative problems.

F. Liaison:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

G. Interagency Coordination:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

H. Plans:

1.  The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONION-1's experience, training, and location to provide the photographic coverage cited above. In addition, the Station plans to make more extensive use of the operational log books and personality observations provided by LIONION-1 in support of an intensive physical penetration program.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

2. During the ensuing period, the Station plans to utilize LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 as LP operators for a portion of the LISAMPAN technical penetration operation. It is anticipated that this additional task will not be levied on LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 until after 1 January 1968.

I. Costs:

1. For the past project year, 1 January through 31 December 1967, it is estimated that the total project cost will be about $9,000. It is approved for $11,666.

2. For the renewal period of 1 January through 31 December 1968, it is requested that $11,258 be approved. This is broken down as follows:

|                                        | FY 1968 | FY 1969 | Total   |

| **Total**                              | $ 5,374 | $ 5,884 | $11,258 |

3. It should be noted that the operational loan made to LIONION-2 to enable her to qualify for *inmigrado* status in Mexico (see Cost Section of previous project renewal request) has been completely repaid. The loan, which was placed in an escrow-type account, was withdrawn in monthly increments by LIONION-1 and incorporated into his revolving fund. A detailed accounting was prepared each month by LIONION-1, a practice which will be continued during the ensuing project year.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 51

J. Technical Annex:

Project LIONION continues to receive excellent technical support from the local WOACRE representative, Walter W. CORNBURY.

K. Other:

While LIONION-2's failing eyesight precludes her filling in for LIONION-1 over any extended period of time, she has continued to perform in an excellent manner in support of LIONION-1.

MICROFILM

1.  Prior to submitting the LIONION project for renewal 1 January 1968, Headquarters requests the Mexico City station comment on the desireability of continuing the photography of persons entering and leaving the PBRUMEN Consulate. As the station is aware this film is no longer reviewed at JMWAVE and there are no present plans to resume this practice since in the past it proved unproductive and costly. The film has never been reviewed on a regular basis at Headquarters and has been referred to only once for identification purposes during the past year. At present the film as received at Headquarters is developed (negatives only) and placed into storage.

2.  Headquarters realizes this coverage is potentially valuable and undoubtedly this film contains photographs of assorted revolutionaries and others of CI/FI interest; but the value lies in the ability to identify the persons being photographed and until we have this capability - and personnel to sort out and follow-up the leads there seems

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIONION
(Photographic/Technical Coverage
of Cuban Embassy in Mexico)

ACTION REQUIRED: Approvals Requested Paragraphs One
and Four

1. Approval is requested to renew Project
   LIONION for the period 1 January through 31 December
   1967 at an annual expenditure of $11,666.00, including
   $5,574.00 for FY 1967 and $6,092.00 for FY 1958. WH
   Division programmed $12,000.00 for this activity for
   FY 1967 and funds are available. The Project cost
   has been increased by $668.00 over the previous year,
   occasioned by a small monthly raise for the Principal
   Agent and a new provision for miscellaneous operational
   expenditures.

2. Although this two-man Project does not
   produce positive intelligence, it contributes sub-
   stantially and directly to the coverage of the Cuban
   Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs
   in bulk of personnel and visitors as well as informa-
   tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,
   and supporting recruitment attempts. It is contemplated
   that the Project will afford support to the extensive
   technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAMPAN)
   currently scheduled for installation in mid-January
1967. One of these penetrations is scheduled for the
      Embassy gatehouse where visitors would normally
      identify themselves upon entering. Information from
      the gatehouse is to be transmitted securely to the
      LIONION bašehouse as well as to the LISAMPAN listening
      post. By collating this and other LISAMPAN information
      with the photography, it is hoped to be able to identify
      photographically many of the visitors to the Embassy.

3. The physical security of the photo-basehouse has been improved and the overall security of the Project is considered to be satisfactory.

4. It will be noted that in February 1966 the Station assisted LIONION-2, a Cuban citizen, to qualify for Mexican immigrant status with a loan of $4,800.00, which was reduced to $2,640.00 as of 31 December 1966 at a repayment rate of $240.00 per month. This loan is being protected by an appropriate Memorandum of Trust. Approval is requested to continue this arrangement until LIONION-2's immigration status is settled, estimated to occur by 30 November 1967.

# LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

SECRET/KAPOK

## A. Current Objectives:

There have been no changes in the objectives of the LIONION Project as set forth in the renewal request of last year.

## B. Changes:

Howard A. TRECKLER has assumed the duties of Case Officer for LIONION since the departure of Lawrence F. BARKER in August 1966. TRECKLER is known to LIONION-1 and 2 as "Jose" or "Joe". TRECKLER meets with LIONION-1 at least once each week and sees LIONION-2 only if he visits the LIONION basehouse. With the departure of Hugh T. FRANCOTTE (P) in August 1966, Walter W. CORNBURY (P) assumed the duties of technical consultanc for the project. CORNBURY is known to LIONION-1 and 2 as "Jack". LIONION-l is being given a pay increase of $8.00 (U.S.) per month effective 1 January 1967. There are no other changes contemplated for the coming year.

## C. Intelligence Production:

The intelligence production is the same as that reported in the renewal request for last year. It is difficult to estimate the intelligence value in numbers of reports as there are so few positive reports made from this type of production on the photographic end of the project. But this photographic coverage is of inestimable operational intelligence value in coverage of the PBRUMEN target. Should the LISAMPAN operation become active, part of LIONION'S time will be used in support of that operation.

## D. Effectiveness:

The Station's estimate of the value of this project has not changed from that expressed in the renewal request of last year. LIONION has further es- tablished his importance to the Station's operational activities by demonstrating his ability to spot surveillance targets at LIRING from only a physical descrip- tion provided by the Case Officer. If the planned LISAMPAN activity gets underway, LIONION observations and insight into activities of LIRING will be increased greatly.

The apartment spotted by LIONION-1 and obtained by the Station across from LIRING that was mentioned in last year's renewal request is scheduled to be utilized in the LISAMPAN operation. The location of LIONION-l across from the target and his background knowledge built up over the years are invaluable assets to the Station's coverage of the primary target of the Related Mission Directive.

E. Problems:

There were no major problems during the past year. One security problem involved the claimed spotting of some of the photogrphic equipment from the street by David M. WILSTED (P). A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONION-1 and the Case Officer failed to reveal any such equipment as being visible from the street. However, additional security measures were taken by darkening the background in the room behind the equipment through hanging of heavier drapes on the window, drapes on the wall, and putting up a portable screen behind the equipment. This also serves as a security check against the prying eyes of the household servant as LIONION-1 can now open the door fully to the room when the servant pages him and she cannot see the equipment. The other problem is the obtaining of inmigrado status for LIONION-2. This involves the depositing of funds to a bank account and is discussed under paragraph I.

F. Liaison:

There is no liaison involved in the project.

G. Interagency Coordination:

Not applicable.

H. Plans:

It is planned to have LIONION-1 keep special logs on the activities of selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past year. With the case officer handling LIONION-l directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to continue picking his brains for additional details on the LIRING target. Hopefully LIONION-1 and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take from the LISAMPAN operation.

I. Costs:

For Calendar Year 1966:

1. In the period 1 January through 30 June 1966, $4,500.00 was expended. The projected expenditure for July 1966 through 31 December 1966 is $5,000,00. This total project year expenditure is approximately $1,000.00 under that approved by Headquarters. However, this amount is probably due to having drawn film and other supplies from overall Station support without their having been charged off against the Project

The total for FY 1967 is $11,666.00. Approval of this amount is requested. Note that the salary figures include the salary raise for LIONION-1 and the usual one month pay Christmas bonus for LIONION-1 and 2. An additional provision has been made for miscellaneous operational expenditures as there may be a recurrence of same as in the past project year for which no provision was made. Provision is being made for charging of funds for supplies to the LIONION Project which was not done last year in order that more accurate bookkeeping may be followed.

In addition, the Station has had to make a loan to LIONION-2 for gaining status to qualify for inmigrado status in Mexico. This loan is held in a savings account in a Mexican bank to prove to the Mexican authorities that LIONION-2 can support herself. Funds are withdrawn from this account monthly, sometimes with interest, and deposited to a checking account where LIONION-1 withdraws the funds and they are applied to the revolving account for financing the operation. The initial balance deposited to the account in February 1966 was $4,800.00. Withdrawals have been made at the rate of $240.00 per month and as of 30 October 1966, the total account had been reduced by $1,680.00, leaving a balance in the account of $3,120.00 which should carry the account through November 1967. A separate dispatch follows with the Memorandum of Trust and necessary details on the account. Approval is requested for continuance of this account in order that LIONION-2 may obtain her inmigrado status.

J. Other:

LIONION-2 continues to perform in an excellent manner in support of LIONION-1.

SECRET/KAPOK

## A. Current Obiectives.

The original objectives of the project have not changed but have been added to in the last year. The project is functioning well as a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance operation against the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City. It is designed to:

1.  Furnish photographic coverage during daylight hours of the two entrances of the carget installation.
2.  Dispatch physical surveillance.teams against persons associated with the target.
3.  Keep in readiness a Matening post (LP) for the monitoring and recording of technical penetrations of the target.
4.  Assist the Station in building up individual dossiers on officials of the target installation.
5.  Monitor Station activities involving direct contact with the target, and furnish an observation post (OP) for other Station assets.

Objectives 4 and 5 are additions to those objectives set forth in the original project outline.

## B. Changes.

There have been no changes in personnel and none are contemplated in the coming year. It is being proposed in separate correspondence that some of the work load now on LIONION-1 be shifted to Headquarters, specifically the development of film.

LIONION-1's pay was increased 40 dollars a month effective 15 March 1965.

## C. Intelligence Production.

The operation has produced thousands of excellent photographs, many of which are shared with Headquarters and Station JMNAVE. Information on the comings and goings of target personnel and visitors to the target installation has been incorporated into many Station files (primarily personality files -- individual dossiers). No precise statistics are available on this production. It has been very heavy. Station JMWAVE shouid perhaps be called upon for an independent evaluation of LIONION production it has received

## D. Effectiveness.

The project is considered both highly successful and essential by the Station. In addition to excellent photographic coverage provided by the LIONION agents, the Station has found in LIONION-1 a first class asset for other operational duties. The LIONION basehouse was essential to mounting and monitoring the LIRHYME recruitment (and harassment) operation. C/O Wallace B. ROWTON sat with LIONION-1 for several weeks, observing the movement pattern of LIRHYME-1. LIJNION-1 manned one of three radios used by the Station when LIKHYME

was invited to appear for confrontation outside the Embassy. Without the LIONION base and the expert knowledge of LIONION-1 of target personnel and activities, such an operation as LIRHYNS could not have been mounted. It might be noted that this operation was an attempt to satisfy the top priority requirement laid on Station Mexico by Headquarters. It is expected that additional similar operations will depend to a large extent on the facilities provided by the LIONION operation.

Another very effective performance by LIONION-I was his obtaining -- by sharp observation and quick, intelligent, secure action -- an apartment in a building directly across the street from the target Embassy. The Station had been seeking an apartment in this building for many years.

E. Problems. The problem of cover for LIONION-1 worked out well during the year to the point where it ceased being a problem. By living his cover as a translator he was enabled to build in strong self protection when called upon to do some translations for the office of the President of Mexico. Toward the end of the year, LIONION-1 received the coveted status of "Inmigrado" which confers a great deal of immunity from harrassment by Mexican authorities.

The only problem now besetting the project is LIONION-1's excessive work load. An indicated above, an attempt is being made to alleviate this load.

F. Liaison. The operation has no liaison connection. LIONION-l's connection with the Mexican Presidency is non-operational.

G. Interagency Coordination. Not applicable.

H. Flans. It is planned to make better use of LIONION-1's observations and operational log books during the coming year rather than settle for his excellent photographs alone. It has been found that he can often supply valuable additionel information because of his "feel" for those persons who are under constant observation from the LIONION base. LIONION-1 can read significance into activity which might go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by observers with less experience. LIONION-I will also be called upon for assistance in future recruitment operations as in LIRHYME. Several such operations are being contemplated for calendar 1966, the period for which project is being requested.

I. Costs.,

1. For calendar 1965:

In the period 1 January through 31 October 1965
$7,218,20 had been expended. At this rate some
$9,200.00 vill be expended in the concluding project year.

SECRET/KAPOK


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

2. For the next period (calendar 1966):

Monthly costs
Salaries: LIONION-1 $ 360.00
LICWION-2 150.00

Rents:: LIONION Baschouse 100.00
LICNION Safehouse 44.00
Utilities 25.00

Supplies: Film 95.00
Faper 60.00
Chemicals 25.00
Miscellaneous 15.00

Monthly total $ 874.00

Allowing for customary year-end bonuses of one month's salary for both agents, the figures for FY 1966 and FY 1967 would be $5,244.00 and $5,754.00 respectively, or a total for the calendar year 1966 of $10,998. Approval of this amount is requested.

J. Other. LIONION-2, although not specifically mentioned above, continues to perform in a splendid manner as assistant to LIONION-1.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIONION (photographic/
technical coverage of Cuban Embassy in Mexico)

1. Approval is requested to renew Project LIONION for the period 1 January through 31 December 1966 at an annual expenditure of $10,998.00, including $5,244.00 for FY 1966 and $5,754.00 for FY 1967. Division programmed $10,750.00 for this activity for FY 1966. Funds are available. The Project cost has been increased by $520.00 over the previous year, occasioned by a small raise for the Principal Agent.

2. The Project has contributed substantially and directly to coverage of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico and is considered highly successful and essential by Station Mexico City. It has produced a large quantity of excellent photographs of target personnel and visitors and has furnished valuable data on their patterns of activity and personal associations. It has also rendered valuable support to Station recruitment attempts against Cuban Embassy personnel and maintains an ever ready facility for support of any technical penetrations of this target accomplished by other Station activities. The Project has had no security or administrative problems. The Station has submitted regular progress reports.

# LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives: This Project is a technical, currently primarily photographic, surveillance operation against the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. Its original objectives, still current, include furnishing photographic coverage during daylight hours of the Embassy and Consulate entrances; furnishing a control point for dispatching physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the target; and furnishing a listening post (LP) in readiness to monitor and record technical audio penetrations of the target. Two new cbjectives added during the Project year include assisting Station Mexico City to build up individual dossiers on target officials; and affording an observation post for Station activities involving direct contact with the target. These new objectives are in consonance with Priority A, Objective 1 of the current Related Mission Directive for Station Mexico City.

B. Changes: There have been no changes in personnel and none are contemplated during the coming year. Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of the film exposed under this Project. LIONION-1's pay was increased $40 per month effective 15 March 1965.

C. Intelligence Production: The Project is not designed to produce disseminable information. It produced thousands of excellent photographs during the year which were shared with Headquarters and Station JMWAVE. Information on the comings and goings of target personnel and visitors to the target have been incorporated into many Station files, principally the dossier files. No precise statistics are available, but at least 100 exposures are made daily during target working hours.

D. Effectiveness: The Project is considered highly successful and essential by the Station. In addition to the excellent photo- graphic coverage provided, LIONION-1, the Principal Agent, has developed into a first-class asset for other operational duties. The Project Basehouse was essential to mounting and monitoring the Station's attempt at recruitment and subsequent harassment of a sensitive target employee. The Case Officer in charge of the attempt sat with LIONION-1 for several weeks observing the movement pattern of the target employee. LIONION-1 manned one of the radio dispatch posts used to control the physical surveillance of the target employee while near the Basehouse.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

Without the Baschouse and LIONION-l's expert knowledge of the
target personnel and activities, such an operation could not
have been mounted. The operation itself was an attempt to
satisfy the top priority requirement laid on Station Mexico City
by Headquarters. It is expected that future similar operations
will depend to a large extent on the facilities provided by
this Project.

Another very effective performance by LIONION-1 was his
obtaining, by sharp observation and quick, intelligent and
secure action, an apartment in a building directly across
the street from the target. The Station had been seeking
an apartment in this building for many years.

E. Problems: The only problem currently besetting the Project
is the excessive work load on the Principal Agent. To alleviate
this, Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of
the film produced by the Project.

Cover for LIONION-1 has ceased to be a problem. He has
received his permanent immigrant status and now has a good deal
of immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities.
He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly
out of the Office of the President of Mexico and thus has a
strong protective security factor built into it.

F. Liaison: The Project has no liaison connection. LIONION-l's
cover backstop with the Office of the President of Mexico is non-
operational.

G. Interagency Coordination: Not applicable.

H. Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-1's
observations and operational logbooks during the coming year
rather than to settle for his excellent photographs alone.
It has been found that he can often supply valuable additional
information because of his "feel" for those persons who are
under constant observation from the Basehouse. He can read
significance into activity which might go unnoticed or be
misinterpreted by observers with less experience. He will
also be called upon for assistance in future recruitment
operations similar to the case mentioned in paragraph D
above. Several such operations are being contemplated for
calendar year 1966, the period for which the Project renewal
is being requested.

I. Costs: For calendar year 1965:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

In the period 1 January through 31 October 1965, $7,218.20 has been expended. At this rate, some $9,200.00 will be expended by the end of the calendar year 1965.

Monthly costs:

```
LIONION-1 $360.00
LIONION-2 150.00
```
Rents:

```

LIONION Safehouse 44.00
```
Supplies:

```
Utilities 25.00
Film 95.00
Paper 60.00
Chemicals 25.00
Miscellaneous Operational Expenses: 15.00
```

Monthly Total: $ 874.00

One-time costs:

It is customary in Mexico to give a year-end bonus amounting to one month's salary:

```
LIONION-1 $ 360.00
LIONION-2 150.00
```

Total: $ 510.00

3. Calendar Year Total

```
Fixed monthly expenses $ 10,488.00.
One-time expenses 510.00
```

Total 10,998.00

4. Fiscal Year Breakdown

```
Fiscal Year 1966 $ 5,244.00

MEMORANDUM FOR: WII/EXO

SUBJECT : LIONION Project

16 February 1965

1.  LIONION is a new project which is submitted in the amount of $10,478. This is a photographic surveillance operation targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Two agents are involved; LIONION-1, a young Cuban lawyer in exile, and LIONION-2, his mother. The agents act as observers and photographers. LIONION-1 is also used as a dispatcher for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team, from which he is compartmented, to cover individuals associated with this target. These agents were previously used in connection with the unilateral telephone tap operation against the Cuban Embassy. The current photographic operation began in the latter part of 1962, and was previously funded under Cuban FI funds. The operation has provided valuable data for the identification of Cuban Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of action and personal associations.

2.  The security of this operation, particularly the agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements, appear reasonably sound. Both agents know that they are working for AIS, and LIONION-1 was successfully FLUTTERED in October 1963. However, LITAMIL-7 and LITAMIL-9, who are penetrations of the Cuban Embassy, are aware of this activity, as they are used to help identify individuals photographed.

3.  Approval for the LIONION Project is recommended. It is requested that, in order to assist Headquarters' evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information.

## II. Operations and Policy

Clandestine activities should be assessed not only in the context of their relationship to an open society but also in the context of their relationship to United States foreign policy.

CIA operations have not been held effectively subordinate to U.S. foreign policy.

1. Clandestine intelligence collection is, by charter, free from State Department control. This fact exposes American foreign policy to a multitude of embarrassments when CIA is discovered recruiting agents or developing sources in a friendly country. The recent Singapore case, when CIA, without notice to the Consul General, tried to subvert a member of the Special Branch of the Singapore Police provides an instructive example. After complications of ludicrous complexity, including an attempt to subject the recruit to a lie-detector test, it turned out that the recruit and long since informed his superiors of the CIA approach and was leading CIA into a trap which, when sprung, produced considerable embarrassment to relations between the US and the Singapore government. There have been treaties of a comparable sort in Pakistan and in (where a group of Chinese Nationals were fermiggled into

CIA has said that, in such cases, neither the Embassy nor the Department in Washington is normally informed of this type of operation. In short, no one knows how many potential problems for US foreign policy -- and how much potential friction with friendly states -- are being created at this moment by CIA clandestine intelligence operation Surely there is an argument for permitting State to decide whether the advantage to be gained by the operation (e.g., the information derived from an agent within the Special Branch of the Singapore Police) outweighs the risk (e.g., exasperating the local government and shaking its confidence both in our purposes and in our sense). Clandestine intelligence operations should plainly be cleared both with the Department of State and (save for exceptional instances and on agreement of the Secretary of State) with the local U.S. Ambassador.

It has ineant too that the State Depertment, cites aparicad ef an operation only in ite later stagon, is under great preacure to endorse the operation as already mounted because of the alleged evil consequences of exercislug a vetc. I wall remember Tom Mann's remark the day the decision was made to go ahead on Cuba: "I would never have favored initiating this operations bat, olace it kaa gone as far as it bae, I do not think we can rich cailing it off." Moreover, a atins when there is lucrancing promiam en activism, Stats, when it questions CLA oparations or initintives, casta thaalf in a pricey, sisey, negativo rele. The advocata of clandestine activities seems 'tough' and realistic, the opponent heo te tavaka rath istangiblos ca she reputation of the United States, world public opinion, "What do we say in the United Nations?", etc., and carme bopalesely idealietis, legalistic and 'scat.'

The result of CIA's initiative in covert political oporations bas boun to cranto situations which have forced policy on the State Department. This was not the original idea behind CIA. As Allen Dulles wrote in hie 1947 memorandum to the Sonats Aruad Services Committee, "The Central Intelligence Agency should have nothing to do with policy." Yot, in the years since, CIA has, In effect, 'made' policy in many parte of the world. A number of governments still in power know that they have even bzen targets of CIA attempts at worthraw -- not a state of mind calculated to etimulata friendly feelings toward the United States. Indonesia, of course, la a prime example.

This experience suggests that the present system by which CIA notifies State of a projected covert operativa is inadequate to protect US bntoroute. There must be some means by which Skote cha be informed ef such operations at an carly enough otaga to affect the conception and preliminary planning of the operation, Ctherwise CLA will con- tinue to confront State with propositions having potential impact on foreign policy but at too late a point to subject that impact to reason- able control.

(The other 2200 are presumably under military or other non-state official cover.) Originally the use of State Department cover for CIA personnel was supposed to be strictly limited and temporary. The Dulles-Correa-Jackson report stated in 1943, "The CIA should not utilize Department cover as a simple answer to all its problems but should proceed to develop its own outside cover and eventually in this way and through increased efficiency of its overseas personnel, find a way to temper its demands upon the State Department." Nonetheless CIA has steadily increased its requisitions for official cover.

There are several reasons why CIA has abandoned its original intention of developing systemized private cover. It is easier to arrange cover through State; it is less expensive; it is quicker; it facilitates the security of operations as well as of communications; it insures a pleasanter life for the CIA people. But the effect is to further the CIA encroachment on the traditional functions of State.

In some missions, I understand CAS personnel outnumbers regular State Department personnel. In the American Embassy in Vienna, out of 20 persons listed in the October 1960 Foreign Service List as being in the Political Section, 16 are CAS personnel; of the 31 officers listed as engaging in reporting activities, over half are CAS. Of the 13 officers listed in the Political Section in our Embassy in Chile, 11 are CAS. On the day of President Kennedy's Inauguration 67 percent of the political officers serving in United States Embassies were CAS. Sometimes the CIA mission chief has been in the country longer, had more money at his disposal, wields more influence (and is abler) than the Ambassador. Often he has direct access to the local Prime Minister. Sometimes (as during a critical period in Laos) he pursues a different policy from that of the Ambassador. Also he is generally well known locally as the CIA representative.

In the Paris Embassy today, there are 123 CIA people. CIA influence has long since begun to move into areas of political reporting normally occupied by State. The CIA men doing overt internal political reporting outnumber those in the Embassy's political section by 10-2. CIA has even sought to monopolize contact with certain French political personalities, among them the President of the National Assembly. CIA occupies the top floor of the Paris Embassy, a fact well known locally; and so on.

the night of the Generals' revisit *in Algeria* possessed-by-hotels with amusement that the top floor was ablaze with lights. (I am informed that Ambassador *Carla* was able to secure entrance that night to the CIA offices only with difficulty.)

CIA is apparently now firmly committed to the CAS approach as a permanent solution for its problems. It is pressing to have CIA people given the rank of Counselor. Before State loses control of more and more of its presumed overseas personnel, and before CAS becomes permanently integrated into the Foreign Service, it would seem important (a) to assure every ambassador the firm control over the local CAS station nominally promised in the NSC Directive of January 19, 1961, and (b) to review the current CAS situation with a view to a steady reduction of CAS personnel.

4. Paramilitary warfare, I gather, is regarded in some quarters as a purely technical matter, easily detachable from policy and therefore a proper function of the Department of Defense. Yet there is almost no CIA function more peculiarly dependent on the political context than paramilitary warfare.

There are several reasons for this. For one thing, a paramilitary operation is in its nature a large and attributable operation and thereby, as suggested above, clashes with the presuppositions of our open society. (These considerations need not apply, however, to the training of, say, the South Vietnamese in guerrilla tactics or to the support of already existing guerrilla activities.) For another, the moral and political price of direct paramilitary failure is acute for us. Communists, when they stimulate paramilitary activity, are doing what the world expects from them; when we do it, we appear to betray our own professed principles and therefore cannot afford to compound delinquency by defeat. Moreover, as the recent Algerian episode showed, once we convince the world that we are committed to a paramilitary endeavor, we will be blamed for all sorts of things. And, as the recent tractors-for-prisoners episode showed, when we do send men to possible death, we cannot lightly write them off and close the books. The Communists, on the other hand, have no scruples about liquidating a losing show.

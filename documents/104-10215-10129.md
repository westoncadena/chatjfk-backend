MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/OA

FROM : Deputy Director of Security (Investigations and Support)

SUBJECT : C-25507
#112569

1. Reference is made to a memorandum dated 17 April 1958 from WE Division through CI/OA requesting that the Covert Security Approval granted on 3 July 1957 be amended to permit Subject's utilization as a career agent in Mexico City under Project LIEDGE.

   This will confirm the verbal Covert Security Approval granted to Mr. Larry Sulc, WH Division on 3 June 1958 for the use described above.

2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Clandestine Services Instruction - Field No. 10-5, a covert security approval is granted for the use of the Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph 1, above.

3. Subjects of covert security approvals are not to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of CIA.

4. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security approval does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should desire at a later date to change the status or use of this individual, a request for approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this office.

5. This approval becomes invalid in the event the Subject services are not utilized within six months of the date of this memorandum.

RE: Project LiROGE
C-25507

1. Miss Emily Brockenbra, FI/projects,
   Telephoned the writer to report that FI intends to hold up final processing of the subject project until a determination is reached by the Office of Security concerning the request for a Covert Security Approval authorizing the agent's assignment in Mexico City.

2. The writer agreed to advise FI/projects when CI/OA receives a report from the Office of Security.

FI/projects advised per above on 23 May 1958.

# CI/OA PROJECT REVIEW FORM

Cryptonym.........LIEDGE

Division...WH.......Station...Mexico

Type of Project........Provide Mexico City Station with career agent to be used as C/O handling CP operations.

Case Officer...Louis Puckett....Room..2121 WH......Ext. 2555

New Project......X...;Renewal of...year-old project...

Amendment..........;Extension for........months; termination........

Project approval period from..1 May 1958.......to......30 April 1959

Recommendations:

1. CI/OA recommends approval on condition the agent Harold R. ROEMAR receives, from the Office of Security, a Covert Security Approval for his new assignment in Mexico City and the results of his LCFLUTTER are satisfactorily resolved. Also, on condition that should the Office of Security request a clearance and LCFLUTTER on this agent's wife, a clearance is issued and LCFLUTTER results are satisfactorily resolved.

2. A new request for CSA for Subject's use in Mexico City was submitted to the Office of Security on 24 April 1958. When the Office of Security issued Subject's last CSA on 3 July 1957, they recommended that Subject be afforded a polygraph as soon as possible. Subject was given on LCFLUTTER a few days ago and although Subject ran clean the polygraph operator began getting some reaction, or hits, regarding the Subject's wife. There is some derogatory information in the Office of Security on what is believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-law.

3. The Office of Security has not reached a final decision regarding CSA and LCFLUTTER for Subject's wife. They have stated, however, that unless the wife can be cleared and LCPLUPER results are clean, it is doubtful whether a new clearance would be issued for the career agent.

1.  Concurrent with this memorandum a covert security clearance is being issued to enable the Subject's conversion from contract agent to career agent for use as principal agent for Project AMPHARCH in Cuba under non-official cover.

2.  This is to advise that information has been received from a confidential source of the Office of Security concerning Argentina CORDERO Calderon and her sister, Counsuelo, who are believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-law respectively. According to a December 1944 report, the above individuals were described as Costa Rican citizens then in Panama under suspicion and members of the Russian Ballet team of Pedro and Lidia CHUPRINE. Argentine is known to speak and understand German. She was formerly married to Pedro MARZAL, reportedly a German national and formerly on both British and U. S. Proclaimed List. She is reliably reported to have made pro-German remarks and is pro-Gervan in her sympathies. It was further reported that both of the above indivimals have at times attempted to secure information from members of the American Armed Forces.

3.  In view of the above information, it is requested that current overseas traces and investigation be conducted on the Subject as well as on his wife and sister-in-law, Counsuelo, and other members of his wife's immediate family and that the results thereof be furnished this office.

4.  The covert security clearance which is being issued in this case is made contingent upon the faovrable results of the requested overseas traces and investigation.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Office of Security

SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA (sp.)
C-25507

1. Reference is made to OS's verbal request of 7 March 1957, for additional information on Subject in connection with our request for a Provisional Covert Security Approval dated 26 February 1957.

2. Subject was born in De Kalb, Illinois, on 20 June 1922. He received his primary and high school education in De Kalb and entered the U. S. Army in 1940, later transferring to the U. S. Air Force. He served as an operations and intelligence specialist, first in the China-Burma theater and later in Panama. He was discharged from the service in 1945 with the grade of Technical Sergeant. After his discharge, he worked for a brief period as a laboratory technician in the Sterling (Illinois) Silica-Cel Corporation and then returned to the Panama Canal Zone to marry a Costa Rican girl in December 1945. For about four months he worked as a stevedore and labor foreman in the Canal Zone. In April 1946 he re-enlisted in the Air Force in the Canal Zone and was discharged three years later, in 1949.

3. Late in 1948 he was recruited by the Agency, and on 1 June 1949 became a CIA contract agent. Since that date, he has served as a contract agent with continuing high level performance, first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is currently assigned to Cuba where he is utilized as Principal Agent of Project ANTHODARCH. Subject has worked principally and successfully so, on Communist Party penetration operations since his engagement with CIA, and his current work involves the handling of a net of agents providing coverage of Communist, leftist, revolutionary and other political activities at the University of Habana, and the student-youth circles in general in Cuba.

4. Subject has always proven to be loyal and trustworthy. In view of his outstanding record and strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a career with CIA, it has been recommended he be converted from contract to career agent status. He was promoted recently to the equivalent of a GS-10 rating.

6. Covert Security Approval, with an expedite Provisional Covert Security Approval, has bean requested in connection with the recomenda- tion to convert Subject from contract to staff status.

Re: AMPHODARCH/Arthur G. VAIVADA

CI Staff notes that training for VAIVADA is scheduled to commence on the same date in the same city as the training scheduled for Colonel PEREZ and Lt. CASTANO of the Cuban BRAC. This situation seems inherently dangerous and unwarranted by the circumstances as known to CI Staff. Pending further justification CI Staff cannot concur in the training as requested, but would of course concur in the training for VAIVADA if the locale vere shifted to another city such as New York.

(This is basically an operational or an operational security matter. CI/R&A/TRB therefore urges that CI/OPS/WH and CI/OA discuss the problem with the desk, and resolve it if possible. CI/R&A/TRB will of course defer to CI/OPS AND CI/OA in this matter.)

COVERIS

CI/085

CI/OPS/WH does not concur with the CI/R & A recommendations as set forth for the following reasons:

1.  The security compromise would only stem from the two BRAC officers identifying the VAIVADA affiliation and training on behalf of this agency. This appears extremely remote as the desk advised there is no indication that the ERAC officers know VAIVADA either by name or sight.

2.  While VAIVADA is being trained, his wife will be attending citizenship classes in D.C. preparing for her citizenship examination before returning to Cuba. Consequently, it would be a financial drain for VAIVADA to stay in New York City and his wife in D.C. In addition, certain per diem costs would be incurred by the Case Officer traveling to New York City to monitor some of the OTR training.

3.  The desk will instruct OTR of this joint training aspect and as a precautionary measure, request that training sites, hours, etc. de not overlap.

TO : C/CI/OA

SUBJECT: Comments and Recommendations on Proposed Covert Training of Arthur G. VAIVADA

REFERENCE: Covert Training Request for Arthur C. VAIVADA of 4 December 1956

1. Arthur G. VAIVADA has worked principally, and successfully so, on CP penetration operations since employment by the Agency. His current work involves the handling of a net of CP penetration agents and informants. ICD concurs in general with the projected training scheduled for subject but recommends that considerable emphasis specifically be placed on anti-CP penetration operations (i.e., principles and practices of penetration of the international Communist Movement).

2. In addition, subject should also be given materials and briefings on Communism in his area of operations. It is suggested that he be given the following materials to study and discuss during the phase of training recommended above: "The Operational Pattern of International Communism in Latin America" (a paper prepared by CI/ICD) and "The Communist Movement of Cuba" (a paper prepared by Miss Anne Kendall). These materials may be borrowed either from CI/ICD/WH (Hein) or from WE/II/Cuba (Boland).

3. Should OTR contemplate presenting in any form any of the CP penetration case studies contained in FEB 52-865-4 ("The CP Penetration Program"- Issue No. 4) to subject during the training sessions, CI/ICD (Hein - extension 3919) should be consulted. Some of the material in FEB 52-865-4 directly concerns VAIVADA's previous operational work.

## 7. Biographic Information

Subject was born in De Kalb, Illinois, on 20 June 1922. He received his primary and high school education in De Kalb and entered the U.S. Army in 1940, later transferring to the U.S. Air Force. He served as an operations and intelligence specialist, first in the China-Burma theatre and later in Panama. He was discharged from the service in 1945 with the grade of Technical Sergeant. After his discharge he worked for a brief period as a laboratory technician in the Sterling (Illinois) Silica-Gel corporation and then returned to the Panama Canal Zone to marry Argentina CORDERO C., a Costa Rican girl, in December 1945. For about four months he worked as a stevedore and labor foreman in the Canal Zone. In April 1946 he reenlisted in the Air Force in the Canal Zone and was discharged three years later, in 1949.

Late in 1948 he had been recruited by the Agency, and on 1 June 1949 he became a CIA contract agent. It was originally planned that he be used in Panama, but he was assigned instead to the HUMANOID Project in Costa Rica. While there, he successfully handled a high-lovel penetration of the Comesunist Party.. In 1953 he was sent to Headquarters for training, and in 1954 he was assigned to PESTOCESS for a brief period. In July 1954 he signed a new contract in Washing-ton whereby he became the new principal agent of Project APHODARCH. He has been under student cover and has worked for his b.A. degree at the University of Habana.

Subject is happily married and is the father of two children. He is fluent in Spanish and is well qualified to continue work in his area of operations as shown by his past performance. He is also very versatile and has a wide range of outside interests, including sports, photograpiny, outdoor life, and many others.

## 8. Previous Training

VAIVADA previously received covert training at Headquarters during the period 5 October through 25 November 1953, under the training alias of "VICKS." The training was of a comprehensive nature.

## 9. Project Objective - Area of Assignment

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

10. Cover - Operational Duties

VAIVADA's present cover consists of being a graduate student at the University of Habana. Efforts are currently underway to obtain a new cover as representative in Habana of a well-known U.S. polling agency. Subject's duties are those of a P/A handling a rather large nst of sub-agent informants in Cuban University-youth circles with emphasis on Communist and revolutionary matters. He reports directly to the Habana Station.

11. Training Cover

Consultation in connection with proposed new polling cover (see above) combined with vacation and acquisition of citizenship for wife (would explain time spent in washington).

1.  From information made available to this office it appears that details concerning the exposure of the technical surveillance of Juan Bosch and subsequent arrests were not fully determined. It is beliovod probablo that ILHAMOID has been compromised with the Costa Rican authorities.

2.  It is understood that, with the exception of the HUMANIST Project, UMANOID is to continue inactive for an undeterained period. Any further contemplated use of HUMANOID should be coordinated with STC/SPB

3.  In view of his wife's and mother-in-law's Costa Rican background and apparent comections and associations with politically significant personalities, it is recommended HUUNOID discontinue using his home to reproduce material obtained in the HUMANIST Projoct.

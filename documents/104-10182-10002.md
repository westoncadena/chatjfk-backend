B. PARI 4625, 9 January 1959
C. DIR 07455, 9 January 1959

201 (not assigned)

1.  Identity of DIR 04851, dated 17 December 1958 (hereafter referred to as Identity) and the undersigned arrived in Paris on 7 January. Our plans to meet and assess Subject were discussed with the Paris Station and arrangements were made to put an interpreter at our disposal. We are most grateful to the Paris Station for the help and support we were given.

2.  The undersigned took a small suite of rooms at the Hotel Celtic, rue Balzac, Etoile in the name of Major Michael C. Long under which he was travelling. It was here that the interviews with Subject took place. Identity stayed in another hotel.

3.  Meetings with Subject: Per the telegram sent from Paris on 19 December (see FROB 2977) Subject appeared at the rendezvous promptly. He had understandably imagined that final arrangements for his departure to Germany would be made and he was a little confused and irked) also under-standable from his point of view, to learn that that was not the case. We explained that there were several steps still to be completed and that he would be introduced to a colleague who wanted to talk with him. After this we would discuss the question of his move to Germany. Subject ob-jected that his travels and the time he has given cost money. We reminded Subject that more than once before we had offered to pay him for his travel expenses and in effect pay him a retainer which ho had refused. We then paid him Frs. 50,000; he was not overly reluctant about taking the money, whereas earlier he had refused except for a token payment of Frs. 5,000 to cover the cost of the medical examination we asked him to have made.

4.  Subject was then introduced to Identity (known as "John") and the interpreter (known as "Paul"). Subject, in keeping with the wishes of Identity, was not told that Identity is a psychologist. After a leisurely and good, but not luxurious, lunch during which the ice was broken, the company repaired to the Hotel Celtic where Identity through the interpreter began his clinical exami res and tests. After this four hour introductory affair, Subject was given some homework and dismissed.

5.  The second formal meeting on 8 January began at 1200 hours. Subject appeared promptly at the hotel room and produced some of the home-work he had been given. He had not finished because he had had no sleep on the night of 6/7 January and, in any case, it was not expected that he would complete the task. This second meeting with Identity was devoted to clinical examination and lasted until about 1800 hours.

6.  Subject appeared as requested promptly at 0900 hours on 9 January for the third session with Identity. He delivered a sizable bundle of completed homework which was given to the contract agent to translate. Platipodis (known as "Ton") thereupon acted as interpreter for Identity. Subject reported that during the night of 8/9 January the French police concerned with watching foreigners had paid him a visit. It was a routine matter and had been triggered because Subject had registered at a hôtel where his carte d'identitie, a special one for foreigners with special markings because he has a criminal record and is restricted to his home departcent, was noted by the hotelier and the police who make regular check.

SECRET

CS COPY


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

Nothing came of the check and there is no reason to believe that Subject will be troubled further. But the prespect of complications with the French authorities, who are cow-a-days frequently in an angry mood anyway, distorted Subject so tint he was not as pliable or as intent on the exercise with Jäantity en he had been. Also, not kicking what could have been behind the police check and not wishing to take unnecessary risks in the cireimstances, we did not dally with the resalning things which needed to be done. Identity was finished with Subject shortly before noon, whereupon se instructed him to check out of his hotel and have ale picture taken, the latter because we had not received by post the negatives he claims to have sent, we met Subject at the Gare Montparnasse at 1500 hours to discover that he had not been able to get the negatives owing to the reluctance of the photographers to part with them, or so he claimed.. Instead, we got several "Photogat" shots and accompanied Subject to the vicinity of his hotel near the Gare St. Lazard where we waited until we saw Subject depart from the hotel after checking out with his things. This we knew that he had departed safely and that he had not got involved in a police follow up.

## 7. Arrangements with Subject:
By the time we left subject on 9 January we promised him that we would write him within five days to inform him of the approximate date of the next meeting and/or give him a general answer whether he will be transferred to Germany; 1.e.. whether he has been hired. DIR 07455 had not yet been received by us in Paris. Before leaving Faris on 10 January we received DIR 07455 which requested that no definite commitment be asce to Subject and we accordingly left a draft letter with the Paris Station which will be sent to Subject on or about 15 January. In double talk this letter will tell Subject that we (the undersigned) have not received a definite answer, that we shall try to get cne for his sake, and that we expect to have one by about 1 February. In the asantine Subject should make no definite plans one way or the other. We trust that it will be possible and convenient to reach a decision con- cerning Subject by about 1 February. In the course of the Paris zeeting we also informed Subject that we (the undersigned) would probably come to fetch him, which tentative assurance was given in order that subject would not have reason to think that he would lose contact with someone he knows and thereby to help buck up his morale. Subject was also told that he would probably go to PEPRIMS if hired. Otherwise, no plans or tentative arrangerents were discussed with Subject.

## 8. Identity's Assessment of Subject:
Case officer discussed Subject at length with Identity and we believe it is safe and fair to state that there is complete general agreement concerning Subject. We may disagree on the point of pairing Subject with ASSATCHEL, but so far this would seem to be a minor matter. Identity struck the phrase that Subject "satisfies all selection criteria" used in PARI 4625 and will have concurred in this dispatch. Identity would prefer not to write a precis of his assessment at this time; he would rather subalt his full assessment which will cover his views concerning pairings with cther possible candidates after his return to Headquarters. There is little we can add and trust that this will suffice for the time being. In general we believe that our assess- ment subaitted as Attachment C to EU7A-24034 is not wide of the mark. We do not, however, wish this to be construed as an indirect report on Identity's assesszent or Subject; he will submit his own report. In- cidentally, we have enjoyed working with Identity on this case and have learned from his techniques and approach. His trip has so far been most salutary.

## 9. Comment concerning a decision on Subject:
The decision on Subject's candidature for SELSOX cugat not be delayed any longer thn is necessary. Identity agreed that Subject will keep for a time and that he very rich wants the job with us. There are several reason's why we think that it would be unwise to delay the decision to remove Subject from France to Germany where he can be hald without undue difficulty. Firet, he is naturally impatient and will not be happy if he is obliged to wait


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

# DISPATCH

for an extended period. While we recognize that Subject's hapiness is not a matter of much larmediate concern, we believe that it could be an i-portant factor in his future handling. Second, Subject reports that his business is doing well and that he hopes eventually to acquire a French passport which in effect would romove the restrictions under which hệ now lives. The acquisition of a passport and financial success would, we believe, considerably change Subject's frame of mind and possibly his willingness for REDSOX. Third, Subject might at any time have a rm-in with the French authorities. It might not be his fault but it might make it Impractical or impossible to reach him when and if he is wanted. Fourth, Subject points out that he cannot simply disappear from Gap without straightening out his affairs, particularly his business affairs with his business partners. "Cannot" may be an exaggeration, but the fact is that Subject is the sort of person who would leave his friends in the lurch, as he sees it, only under extreme circumstances. He would not be happy about having done so. He would like to have about three weeks warning before his departure and as far as we can judge this is not an unreasonable request. In short, we believe that Subject is an excellent, albeit not ideal, candidate and that it would be wise to insure his availability insofar as we can by bringing him at the earliest possible date to Germany where we shall have better control.

# SECRET

# REPORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION

SUBJECT: AEASPIC

Dates of Examination:
8, 9, 10 January 1959

Subject was met in Paris on the above dates by the case officer and the examiner and was submitted to a preliminary psychological examination via a French interpreter.

Subject was born 12 July 1918 in Georgia which, at this time, was not yet part of the USSR. The Subject classifies his parents as "Nobles" and is of the opinion that their status had a great influence upon his behavior and development particularly in the period which followed the family's flight from Georgia to France in 1921. In other words, the Subject abides by the prejudicial class attitude of Noblesse Oblige and feels an obligation of honorable and generous behavior attributable to his birth rank. He is also of the opinion that this concept of nobility has evolved into a system of dignity and pride in his endeavors. This concept is also extended to include the attitude: "If you pretend to be something, you have to act accordingly."

The family fled Georgia before the Soviet invasion. The Subject feels that he was too young to understand but recalls having revolted against the flight because it was a humilitating defeat rather than a tactical retreat. He operates by the attitude that one must fight, surpass or conquer rather than to submit or accept defeat. He is, according to his own self-concept, a person who can not tolerate being beaten in competition. As a child the Subject felt that he was much stronger than several million men. He presents the analogy that he is like a man who wants to kill an elephant. All he needs provided for him is a high powered rifle and then he would feel equal to the elephant. The Subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his size and strength but he denies any feelings of intellectual inferiority and admits that he depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his physical abilities. Apparently the Subject has never been able to accept what he considers the original defeat and flight from Georgia.

211-233477


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 40

In addition, his father later returned to Georgia because he wanted to
die in Georgia. Although the Subject can appreciate tis father's point
of view he is unable to forgive his father for having admitted his defeat
by returning to Georgia to die. Although the Subject does not regard
himself as a Georgian and is certainly not regarded as a nationalist,
he is a competitive individual and may be motivated for affiliation in order
to compensate for having experienced what he regards as defeat at the
hands of the Soviets. To substantiate the validity of the presence of
this attitude in his personality he offers the example that when he was
committed to prison he was not bothered by the prison life but by
the fact that he had made a wrong calculation in associating himself with
an unreliable partner and consequently was arrested and imprisoned.
For him, therefore, the first day in prison was worse than all the others.
According to the Subject, the sense of defeat together with the competitive
urge to balance the score is the primary factor in his personality and
life experience. In addition to these, as was mentioned above, he is
highly self-confident and optimistic that he will succeed despite the
hazards and odds. It would appear that these attitudes are important
as regards his motivation for affiliation, management and utilization
of his services.

Because the father had provided himself with certain monies the
family was able to live comfortably and even opciently upon its arrival
in France. However, the vicissitudes of life brought the family
progressively to financial difficulties and later to material degradation.
The Subject is of the opinion that this loss of economic status had a
marked influence upon his way of thinking thereafter. Whereas the
family had previously lived in an artificial, feudalistic way it was
not brought into more direct contact with reality and, although this
was not necessarily a bad influence, life was tough. The Subject's
early loss of economic status is important as regards his selection
for affiliation because it also constituted a loss of social status which is
more primary in Subject's personality. A review of the Subject's life
history reveals that he has always responded to material incentives in
his various schemes and ventures. However, in terms of his personality,
material success is uccess is a short-cut method of attaining social status.
Consequently, it may be concluded that his drive for social status is
more basic than his need for financial status..

From an early age the Subject was non-disciplined and in the
school situation he constantly rebelled against the authority of those
teachers whom he felt did not regard him as intelligent or pay him

-2


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 41

sufficient individual attention. Because he felt his teachers were too distant they were automatically unpleasant and apparently his rebellious behavior was his way of obtaining attention and getting closer to the teachers. He consistently refused to abide by the conformist attitude of his peers and felt compelled to do those things not normally done by others. He engaged in practical jokes and was generally regarded as an activist in the school situation. As a result he was expelled from one shcool after another and accumulated a record of having attended 18 different schools. It is also of interest that he never obtained a degree from the institutions of higher education which he attended.

This early delinquent behavior in the school situation is of interest to us because it reflects the Subject's motivational attitudes which are present to date. As far as he is concerned, his scholastic experience, generally speaking, represents frustration, the seeking of a goal to puruse and his hope that his ideals would crystalize and materialize. The Subject is rather abstract in this interpretation. It would seem that his ideal involves not only material but moral comfort and security. However, he has always regarded society, through his disappointments and mortifying experiences, as wicked and selfish in its majority. Consequently, he expressed his dissatisfaction in the form of aggressive and anti-social behavior typical of the malcontent.

One might ask why this individual reacted to his life experience in this manner. He was apparently a precocious child who experienced disillusionment both in his family and in his society. At first he felt this disillusionment was unique and peculiar to himself, but he soon discovered that his discontent was also shared by others. This reinforced his combative attitude and he reflected this attitude in his non-conforming behavior. It was as if he suddenly had discovered to his great disappointment that there was no Santa Claus.

Another aspect of his system of ideals proceeds from his concept of chivalry which he feels his parents inculcated. This is a sort of Robin Hood concept by which the Subject visualizes himself as a hero who rushes to the rescue of the weak and oppressed. This concept is somewhat afantastic and has misguided his behavior in various situations throughout his life. For example, the school situation, he would typically assume blame for the wrong-doings of others. Later in life he responded to the plight of others for the conscious reason of wanting to help them. The Subject feels that many people need help and that he has always wanted

-3-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

to help others in order to help himself. In other words, he is motivated to help others in order to obtain love and affection. His need for love and affection is probably one of his most basic needs and this need is expressed in all of his interpresonal contacts.

The Subject's mother reacted to his neurotic behavior with over-affectionate solicitousness. Although she wasn't actually able to determine the reasons for his internal distress she was aware that something was taking place within him and finally took him to a psychiatrist because of his behavior problems. However, she didn't feel able to advise him of what she was doing and took him to the psychiatrist on a subterfuge. In addition, because the Subject disagreed with the psychiatrist's conclusions, he did not benefit by this experience. This would indicate that in handling the Subject it would be wise not to approach him covertly or as if he were a problem but to permit him to maintain his posture that he is right and that society is wrong. The mother was a marked conformist who insisted that the Subject should abide by the social order. To be successful, the Subject's handlers should avoid trying to make him conform in his attitudes toward society by well- meaning gestures or contrivances.

The Subject continually deceived and disappointed his mother because each time she started him in a new school he made promises that he would behave but each time he managed to be expelled because of his behavior. The Subject is consciously convinced that his mother acted in his good interest and not for her satisfaction of wanting a perfect child. However, it is the opinion of this examiner, that the mother's over-solicitousness was compensatory for her basic rejection of the Subject. It is not likely that she did things for him but that she did things to and with him for herself. In other words, she wanted the Subject to be perfect so that he could be worthy of her love. This may also have been her attitude toward her husband. The Subject did not behave perfectly, did not merit her love and consequently appears to be continually seeking the love and affection of other persons. However, the Subject carnot accept this opinion as regards his mother and denies that she acted in her own interest. One of his principal defenses, is denial simply assuming the attitude that such and such is not true when he probably believes it is true.

The Subject regards his mother as having been the axle of the family. He also regards her as having been the major influence in his life. He is particularly disappointed in his mother because he feels, although he loved her, she deserted him through suiefde. He feels she had sacrificed herself completely for her children and that she killed herself because she no longer knew how to distribute love and care. Concomitantly, the Subject began to lose regard for his father when he realized that his father was not providing his mother with affection. However, the Subject identifies with his father in the respect that both have no never achieved anything significant and consequently may have disappointed his mother. The Subject misses his mother's love and feels that his life was broken when she died. He found himself completely alone and all his illusions apparently disappeared. He has tried to obtain affection through others and realizes that his need for affection is a big part of himself. On the other hand "I am a complicated person, however, I am not difficult to understand,"

The Subject reflects disappointment in his father as a personal ideal. He regards his father as an independent person who was kind but profoundly selfish. Nevertheless, the father would give the shirt off his back. The father was fond of children, loved the whole family and was happy when he saw others happy. However, the Subject is disappointed in his father in that his father never succeeded. He feels that if his father had succeeded none of the things that happened in his life would have come to pass. He feels that his mother's suicide is a direct consequence of his father's failure to succeed.

When the father returned to Georgia the Subject was driven to dispair over the dissolution of the family. The Subject was the baby of the family and the death of his mother and the departure of his father and sister were a threat to his emotional security. He tried to restrain his father by threatening him that because of a French law requiring foreigners to pay taxes before leaving the country, the father ran the risk of being arrested. When the Subject told his sister this, she became angry and replied that the father was mature enough to act as well as possible. The Subject's attempt to prevent his father from leaving was conflictual for him because, although he didn't want his father to leave, he also did not want to interfere with his father's desire. This experience taught the Subject that when his father made a decision he would carry it through at any cost. As it happened, the result was the disintegration of the family. However, this incident is of interest


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

to the Subject's handlers because he indicates that he will abide by firm authoritative decisions even though he objects to them.

Whereas the Subject was attached to his mother, his sister was identified with his father. The sister followed her father to Georgia out of a spirit of affection and sacrifice because she felt that her father needed her. The Subject regards his sister as a tributary of his father's mistakes. The sister taught languages in school and at the time of Stalin the children would say: "We have done this and that thanks to Stalin!" She would reply: "You are individuals and you have done this or that without Stalin!" As a result she was arrested and sent to a concentration camp but with the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and returned to her job. It would appear that the sister is an individualist like the Subject.

The sister's husband had emigrated to France at a much later date and apparently could not adapt himself and regretted having left Russia. He returned to Russia and the Subject believes that because he had served in the German Army he was sent to a concentration camp in Russia. Subject regards the intellectual level of his brother-in-law as that of his sister. The brother-in-law also had an inferiority complex and this may have been an additional reason why the Subject had rejected him as a brother-in-law.

The Subject's brother, who is an architect in Gap, appears to be an independent person who is conservative and more conforming than the Subject. The Subject does not regard his brother as having distinguished himself in extraordinary fashion. It is of interest that the Subject may be jealous of his brother and states that his brother has been more successful but in his own sphere and in terms of his own standards. It is of interest also that the Subject's philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been unsuccessful but to try to explain his lack of success by the process of introspection and self-analysis. This emphasis and orientation as regards obtaining a greater knowledge of himself is typically a neurotic and represents his need to love himself and to rationalize his failures. The Subject feels that his brother is jealous of him whereas it is likely that both are jealous of each other. It is also likely that the Subject and his brother were rivals for the mother's affection. For example, the Subject feels both he and his brother loved the same type of women.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 45

The Subject was more expressive of his affection toward his mother whereas his brother was more timid, shy and independent. When the brother saw the Subject getting his mother's attention he tried to replace the Subject. When the brother learned that the Subject was seeing a girl whom he knew too he advised the girl to leave the Subject alone. This sibling rivalry may continue to date. However, the fraternal relationship is likely to be more complex. It may be that the brother regards the Subject as "Peck's Bad Boy" or the balck sheep of the family and is interested in fostering the Subject as regards opportunities for accomplishment or success. For some reason or other this examiner has the feeling that the brother may have been indirectly instrumental in the spotting of the Subject. The Subject tends to steer away from a discussion of his brother and chiefly presents the data that this brother is kind, somewhat vain and that he is fond of his brother. By a comparative analysis of the Subject and his relationship to his brother it is apparent that the Subject has a very strong desire to succeed and to to accomplish. He was also influenced by others in this regard. For example, at a certain time in his childhood the Subject lived near some former Georgian resistance who had fought against the Soviets. The Subject regarded these persons as uneducated but admirable and affectionate. He feels that he certainly must have been influenced by their exciting stories of their many exploits. He feels he must also have been impressed by their patriotism. The Subject is a sentimental person and he was exalted and deeply impressed by the warm and enthralling manner in which they expressed themselves. He feels that this particular association may have contributed to his passion which he always puts into the execution of whatever he undertakes.

The Subject claims that he has learned from his personal experiences in life rather than from school or from the experiences of others. He feels that he has educated himself in the school of life and has derived little from formal education or from the experiences of others. For example, he claims that his mother's opinion had importance for him only at the time she rendered her opinions. As far as he was concerned they did not have a lasting influence. This item is important as far as the Subject's reaction to future training is concerned. It is likely that he would be impatient to proceed with the task in actuality rather than to learn about performing a task through the experiences of others.

# SECRET

The Subject feels that throughout his school experience, perhaps only one or two teachers really understood him. He regarded the others as apparently idiotic or worthless. These particular teachers taught him that it was often necessary in life to swallow a great deal of useless "stuff" so that thereafter, certain essentials could be more easily digested." This is another helpful hint as regards the trainers who may be assigned to the Subject.

Subject feels that, apart from his academic progress at school, he learned that it was necessary to communicate, to express himself, to understand and explain. He feels that these are necessary skills in society and he relies quite heavily upon his verbal intelligence. It is likely that he would relate well with a person who exhibited superior wisdom and expressive ability. It is also likely that he would relate poorly to an inarticulate person of lower intelligence.

The Subject was also influenced in his mental development by heroes " such as Lindberg, Edison, Hitler, Einstein, et alia. The Subject reasoned that if such people existed, the possibility to act either for good or evil also existed. The Subject never identified with one hero in particular but with heroes in general. As a result he wished to be a hero himself. The Subject also remembers certain outstanding men of history from whom he learned a certain order was necessary for the good of the people. However, it developed that the Subject was disillusioned in these men and his ideals were shaken when he later learned to his dismay that they could commit abject or monstrous acts. Related to these experiences, is the fact that the Subject puts no stock in emblems or signs of rank or reputation. He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not impressed. The fact that he tends to be a skeptic or a cynic should be_important to his handlers.

As a foreigner in France the Subject was liable to mobilization into the French Army at the beginning of World War II. However, he felt the authorities took an awful long time to make a decision in connection with him and because of this he joined the French Foreign Legion and left immediately for North Africa feeling that at last he was becoming a member of a famous unit and at the same time fulfilling his obligations towards the French military service. This is an example of his impulsivity, sentimentalism and need for prestige. However, it was not long before he became dissatisfied and expressed his discontent in opinions that

-8-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 47

France was an incoherent mess. He bitterly regretted that he had become acquainted with people who obviously did not know what they wanted. The Subject feels that his experience in the Foreign Legion did not have any great influence on his character except that it mobilized a profound dislike for irresolute persons. This point was dealt with before. However, it is worthwhile to repeat that the Subject is an impatient fellow who desires immediate action as regards his interests. He is impatient with postponement and with what he regards as a lack of resolve on the part of others. Unless he is dealt with promptly he develops critical opinions and complaints. As regards his affiliation, it is important to note that he has no real alternative at this time and is therefore required to accept normal procedures.

Although he may regard these procedures as a waste of time he will accept them because he lacks control at this point in his processing.

The Subject married for the principal reason of creating a family and a home. Even though he understands the values of the principles involved, principles which were inculcated by his father, he now feels that it was a ridiculous mistake to marry just for the sake of principles without the necessary sentiments. He rationalizes that, at that time, he was merely abiding by the precepts of his father without thinking of the possible consequences. However, he soon discovered that creating a family did not represent anything at all except "aggravating the incoherence and the division of society". In other words, for the Subject, marriage meant building a wall around himself. He also found that, instead of finding a partner who complemented him, all he obtained from the partnership was a reflection of himself. (In selecting a partner for this Subject it would be wise to consider this aspect.). The Subject feels that so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He is of the opinion that women are necessary for sexual purposes but he fails to understand why it is necessary to "build a separate world" with them. It would appear, in terms of the Subject's anti-social attitudes, that he had hoped to create his own world through marriage, but found that this was an illusion. He does not assume the responsibilities for this attempt.

The Subject does not regard his marriage as a complete fiasco. He feels that both he and his wife were fairly nice and that they got along fairly well with one another but did not live very comfortably. Furthermore, he did not feel that there was any evolution in the marriage. He admits to his debit that he married because he wanted to experience what it meant

-9-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 48

to have children. Actually, however, he did not want children as individuals in themselves but he assumed that the marriage would produce a child whom he exactly imagined and which would be a reproduction of himself. However, the first child turned out to be a female and this may have shaken the Subject. The Subject voluntarily submits that he has learned the difference between the male and the female. This would seem to be a peculiar statement but it has a good deal of meaning for him, particularly as regards his relationship with his mother, sister, wife and first child. He regards women as alogical and as being determined by a psycho-feminine education. He developed this attitude originally as a defense against his mother's conforming tendencies and it is probable that he crystalized the attitude when his wife rejected him after he had attacked the bank and was arrested. His wife had a second child while the Subject was in jail and the Subject knows nothing about either of his children.

(This is enough to tip us off that the Subject should not be exposed to females who would be important in his handling.)

During World War II the Subject became involved in black marketeering and in the false documents business and claimed to have created a gang which he led and to have traveled throughout Central Europe. He also claims that the primary purpose of the gang was to repatriate or liberate war prisoners and that technically speaking, the black market business was a worthless branch, the only purpose of which was to solve financial problems. However, he admits, that it is true that the black market business reached such a magnitude that a person that was interested only in making money could have found it a quite satisfying and sufficient activity in itself.

As was mentioned above the primary purpose of the gang, according to the Subject was to liberate prisoners. He was successful in releasing 13 French prisoners from Germany. He claims not to have done this for patriotic motives but for humanitarian reasons. He helped the prisoners because they needed help and because he felt it was the right thing to do. He was paid for this but claims to have given his money to help the prisoners. He helped the French prisoners despite the fact that he had sympathy for the Germans. He claims that his sympathy for the Germans was based on the fact that some Georgians had relatives in Germany and he hoped that the Germans would defeat the Russians. If the prisoners had been Germans he would have done the same thing.

-10-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 49

Even though he admired and sympathized with the Germans he claims
he would not have harmed France. All this is rather complex. However,
it is possible to understand his motivations according to his basic principle,
which involves a vague desire to help others who need it. He also
expresses pride in doing the outstanding and the difficult. The material
reward is not an ultimate end in itself. His emotionalized ideals are
not expressed clearly in terms of politics or nationality. This comples
of motivations will also be discussed in terms of the Subject's participation
in the bank robbery.

Although the Subject was satisfied, on the whole, with the
technical efficiency of his gang and although he was pleased with the
freedom of movement and his apparent security, he was arrested because
of carelessness or a slip, not in the actual functioning of the gang, but
rather on the part of one of the men whom the gang was helping.
Consequently the Subject was arrested by the Gestapo. Because he
was considered by the Germans to be a very important prey he played
along and led the Germans to believe that he was more important than
they had figured. He hoped that such a tactic and belief on their part
would bring him certain advantages. Although he realized that he could
have been shot for only half what he had done and that it may have been
disadvantageous for him to exaggerate his part he claims to have done
so in order to mix the tracks, to confuse the German authorities and to
avoid "fingering" certain partners whom he made appear as negligible
in the scheme. He played this game as long as he could but his end
gradually drew near. However, he is an imaginative fellow and he
hit upon the idea of claiming that he had invented a very interesting motor
that would run without gas. The Germans, of course, could have
profitably used such a machine at this point in the war and consequently
took his offer into consideration and postponed his execution. As a result
he bought time and shortly thereafter was liberated by the Americans.
Through this experience the Subject has learned that it is very important
to know the weaknesses of authorities and to play these weaknesses against
one another. His emotions correspond to a joy of being the sole master
of the situation. He feels that if he were to find himself in this sort of
asituation-again that he would act in exactly the same way. This
behavior is typical of that of a con man. He has the capacity to control
a situation in his own interest and to imaginatively talk himself out of
rather tight situations. This is an outstanding characteristic
of his personality and consequently should be noted by his handlers.

-11-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

However, it would appear to the examiner that there is more to this story than meets the eye. One would suspect that, since he obtained mild treatment at the hands of the Gestapo. he probably collaborated more than he is willing to admit at this time. It may be that he did not fool the Gestapo at all. It is quite possible that the Gestapo used him to pass on the authenticity of documents of other prisoners or in some other nefarious activity. If this can be established as true by other techniques then we are dealing with a person who places self-preservation above all else.

The Subject also has a history of criminal activity in France after the war. At that time he was married and was the father of one child. He was working at a model-maker's shop and although he was not well off he was earning a decent living. According to the Subject a close young friend solicited his assistance in attacking a bank in order to finance an intended marriage. At first the Subject felt that the other fellow was crazy to dare to to attack a bank. He also claims to have had a twinge of conscience and asked himself the question, "Is it right to do harm by robbing a bank?" Furthermore, he never felt that a team of two partners would be able to attack a bank successfully. Apparently the other fellow was a fairly good recruiter. He reminded the Subject of his war activities and he was of the opinion that since the Subject had been able to accomplish certain illegal activities in the past that he would be quite capable of attacking a bank. He also displayed a confidence in the Subject's capability to invent a plan of attack and played on the Subject's love of risk, of his need for friendship. At each point in the developments the Subject tried to withdraw by saying: "If my mother learned of this, she would die." He postponed the job indefinitely. However, in the meantime his mother died and his friend felt that he no longer had an excuse. The Subject compromised by agreeing to knock over a jewelry store. Apparently they knocked over two jewelry stores for the sake of good measure. However, after having spent his money, the friend again returned with a proposition to attack the bank. The Subject told him: "You got your money for your marriage; now leave me alone." However, the friend had not married his intended, was broke, and was interested in financing another marriage. They agreed that this would be the last job. Afterwards, however, the other fellow apparently threw his money around and was arrested and squcaled.

-12-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 51

The Subject claims that after he casually learned of his friend's arrest he fled to the Spanish border. He had not foreseen or had prepared himself for such a consequence and he implies a conflict as regards leaving France. In any event, he was captured and imprisoned. The question arises in this examiner's mind as to why the Subject either panicked or was awkward in his flight, if he did have a chance to flee. It may have been that he unconsciously wished to be caught and to be punished in order to relieve his guilt. He was ambivalent about attacking the bank. If this is true, then important consideration should be given to the Subject's personality as regards plans for the eventuality of his being captured in the course of the project.

Subject feels that he failed badly when he was arrested both by the Germans and by the French. He feels that these two incidents were a consequence of of poor selection of friends and poor planning. If he were to find himself in the same type of situation again he would take all the necessary precautions in order to avoid the same pitfalls. When he was jailed by the French Police he was somewhat depressed by the facts that he had failed in his planning and also that he had greatly disappointed his relatives who looked down upon him as a noisy and rash fellow rather than as a man who was capable of carrying out a crime. This was quite a blow to his ego. However, his ego didn't collapse. There have been times in his life when he felt the entire world seemd to conspire against him and when everything seemed destroyed. He has always felt that there are ways to get out of a mess, principally by exerting his ego. He continues to believe that, unless a man is so weak, both physically and morally, it is always possible for him to get back on his feet or at least to hope that this is possible. Consequently, the Subject continues to believe that there is always a possibility to fight and to conquer. This optimism may be motivational in his present desire to affiliate with us.

In the two projects which involved liberating French prisoners and attacking the bank, Subject claims that he was betrayed by another. However, he felt his betrayal was unimportant and consequently was not angry at these persons. Because he feels that there are certain moral values which he holds dearly, namely friendship, these persons lost his esteem but he was more in contempt of himself for having miscalculated. Although his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life, regardless of their size and consequences, he does not feel that they have discouraged him about future possibilities. "If there is a future, there is hope!" The Subject feels that he has never completely lost self-control


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

and that he has always been a master of his actions at all times and that these actions could have been changed by his own volition. This attitude reveals his tremendous narcissistic investment in his own powers. As far as this project is concerned, it would be unwise to rely upon the Subject's judgements and it would be more prudent to plan every detail for him and require him to abide by directions. He is an imaginative executor but he is a very poor planner according to the testimony of his record. His actions are often impulsive and unreasoned. Such irrational behavior may take place in the context of a relationship with another person despite the fact that the Subject may actually have no particular responsibility to the other person except a tie of affection. The Subject is unable to explain this peculiar aspect of his personality and he is aware that any explanations which he might offer are not rational or sufficient. Consequently, this examiner conclude's, that his impulsivity and tendency to behave irrationally, and to his own disadvantage amounts to an unconscious determinent of his behavior and is not available to a rational analysis. His propulsion by an uncontrollable internal force is an important point of consideration as regards his utilization by this project.

In summary the Subject's chief motivations for illegal activity appear to be the following:

a. The Subject will apparently do anything for a friend or for a person in need.

b. Subject's relish of novelty, excitement, derring-do and action. He is a Jesse James type.

c. Emotional outlet as regards the Subject's desires to invent and to realize a success of an invention. The Subject is an inventor by virtue of his temperament and mentality and indulges himself in problem-solving behavior and apparently obtains a compulsive satisfaction if his idea's work out. In other words he is activated to carry out an action because of his displaced interest in successfully engineering and accomplishing a challenging task.

-14-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

d. Material reward. As was mentioned before, material reward appears to be a means to social status. In the case of the bank robbery the friend obtained three-fourths of the take and the Subject was content not to spend his money freely in order not to arouse his wife's suspicions.

e. Competition with authority. Apparently the Subject regarded the Paris bank as a symbol of authority and was motivated to compete with what this symbol represented. It may be that he did not actually wish to defeat the authority but that he wanted to obtain the attention of authority as he did in the school situation. He certainly accomplished this. The authorities are still paying attention to him. In fact they treat him as a "headstrong little boy", and are continually interested in what he has on his mind. Their interest, of course, is not therapeutic but one of prevention.

f. Unrealistic optimism together with an exaggeration of his own powers may also motivate theSubject to engage in such activities. Unconsciously he may feel like David who was able to defeat Goliath by virtue of possessing aling-shot. One can just see him standing on a counter of a bank with drawn pistols and with the clientele being immobilized in a state of fear and surprise. The situation is so fantastic that it is corny. However, it is meaningful for the Subject and may partially explain his interest in writing detective novels. If one would read his novel he would obtain a very good picture of the Subject.

g. The bank robbery may have represented the subject's expression of his feelings of freedom upon release from his mother through her death. She had always attempted to try to make him conform. His wife is apparently the same type of person as his mother and she proved it by rejecting him when she learned about his anti-social behavior.

h. The Robin Hood concept, which was mentioned before may instigate the Subject to take from those in power and provide for those in need.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

There is an indeterminancy in the examiner's mind as to whether the Subject is a leader or a follower. He claims to have been a leader of the gang during World War II but in a careful analysis his relationship with his bank partner it would appear that the other person was the leader. The Subject, in this instance, was more of an "idea man" and executor whereas the other chap was the instigator. There is no question that the Subject regards himself as a leader. However an inspection of the record indicates that he is a poor leader because he is impulsive, rash and tends to fail. Furthermore, he is like the cat in the Walt Disney film who, while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention directed to catching and incorporating the mouse, inadvertantly gets himself run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered by the truck is one of disappointment as regards not having arrived at the goal, i.e., catching the mouse. Despite this defeat he is able to pick himself up again, figure things out and continue his pursuits. However, he does not learn by experience and he repeatedly is defeated because he keeps his eye too much upon the goal and not enough upon the hazards involved in reaching the goal. In addition to his lack of attention to necessary details the Subject is also as was stated above, emotionally "stupid", impulsive, rash, immature, inexperienced, misguided and unplanful. Consequently it is no surprise that he has failed repeatedly throughout his life.

In regards to the above, another incident of this man's life is relevant. His left index fingertip and thumb tip are missing. He claims to have lost these in an explosion which occurred in Germany when he was involved in the repatriation deal. According to him, after the bombing of Berlin, he picked up among the ruins an unexploded bomb of British origin and took it home to salvage the explosive which he might have used in various ways. While he was removing the detonator which was probably stuck in its receptacle, it exploded in his hands. The explosion occurred so quickly that there was no immediate pain but those around him became panicky. He remained cold-blooded and gave the order to remove all things which were there because the explosion undoubtedly alerted the police. When the police came they explained that he had played with a fountain pen which had burst. They took cognizance of his decorations and advised him never to pick up objects dropped by the enemy. The Red Cross cared for his wound. The Subject does not regret the fact that he tried to dismantle the bomb because he feels he had definitely learned that one should keep

-16-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

his hands away from certain things. This bomb incident may be indicative
of the things which were discussed in the preceeding paragraphs. There
may be more to the bomb incident than the Subject offers but this could
not be established by the clinical method.

Subject feels that a critic would say of him that the majority of
his undertakings have brought results which were considerably less
than hoped for. Consequently, he feels that a critic would regard him
either an optimist or a joker or else that his views on the possibilities
of accomplishing are not very sound.

In his own defense the Subject feels that he has made many
mistakes in his life but however big these mistakes were, he does
not feel that they have basically influenced his character. He feels
that his character basically involves the desire to become a worth-
while individual even at the cost of behaving wrongly. He feels that if
the only criteria for judging a man are his achievements, that he may
be regarded as a failure. He emphasizes that the value of an achievement
does not consist in its spectacular magnitude or in its multiplicity.
For example, he feels that it is not necessary to mass-produce a
machine for an object in order to fully understand its function. He
realizes that, commercially speaking, it is more rational to mass-
produce the item but this repetition does not interest him. In his
opinion, the creative idea and the prototype have a much greater
value and importance than the establishment of a factory which would
popularize the prototype. To illustrate this attitude further, the
Subject is of the opinion that one single thought from a great figure
is more valuable than millions of books which are published annually.
This attitude, of course, may be interpreted as the defensive orientation
of a romantic idealist who has not achieved in practical affairs. However,
there is more to this. In the Subject's value system, it is more important
to act intelligently, sensibly and efficiently. For example, if he were
asked to open a window he feels that it would be up to him to decide
as regards the appropriate method. He likes to carry out an intellectual
effort which results in efficiency. Consequently, he may be regarded
more as an "idea man" than an implementer. Of additional interest
to his future handlers is his desire to independently figure out the way
that something should be done. This tendency is likely to appear in his
training and preparation. It would be well to keep this in mind. The
Subject feels that he has a tremendous vitality which, in the past, has
expressed itself through false attempts such as the bank robbery etc.

-17-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

He feels that he is not being used properly and that there is a power within himself, a creative urge for movement and realization which is highly emotionally charged and which permits him to feel that he is capable of doing much more than he has in the past, However, this energy will have to be rationally harnessed if it is to be productive.

Another aspect in regard to the above is that one of the Subject's chief motives is curiosity. He continually seeks the unknown. However, when he approaches the unknown he experiences emotional insecurity and is ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing. This may have been a factor which influenced his unsuccessful escape through the Pyrenees. The Subject has a fear about which he doesn't know or understand and is afraid of getting himself into something which he cannot get himself out of. His immediate action is to withdraw without solving the problem. Consequently, it would appear that the Subject needs the direction of superior intelligence in order to help him evaluate the realities of a situation or predicament. He needs firm support, guidance, and direction as regards the consideration of all possible eventualities and alternatives. As was said before, it must be kept in mind that his urge for self-preservation is stronger than his desire to solve problems or to carry through on a venture. On the other hand, the Subject claims that he always tries his hardest to keep his promises. Thus, if he agrees to do something he will attempt to carry it through despite the dangers involved. He may be rash in this regard but feels his rashness is due to the fact that he thinks quickly and is able to rapidly apprehend and synthesize the components and essence of a problem in its various perspectives. In other words, he is alert and quick and gets the point immediately even before you finish your sentence. However, it would be wise not to interpret his intellectual alacrity as a commitment or as an index that he will complete a task. It means merely that he gets your point; it doesn't mean that he will cooperate, especially when the going gets rough.

Another factor of interest to the project is that this person is not likely to change as regards his basic characteristics. He has marked difficulty projecting himself in terms of what he would like to be. It is his opinion that in order to change himself, it would be necessary that he would become an entirely different person. However, he feels that everything is relative and perhaps he should show more strength of character, be little more compromising, more realistic and less sentimental. However, according to him, this would imply that the environment would be such that there was no room for sentiment. In this case, his personality would be

-18-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

definitely out of place. Consequently, the Subject does not think he will be a very different person in the future from what he is now. However, he hopes that his material situation will have improved not necessarily financially, but socially. He also naively hopes that the world will change and that there will be no discrimination and that there will be a general improvement of living conditions for everyone. He is a humanitarian in his outlook but he is not an activistic social reformer, except in the sense that he is an individualistic rebel. Generally he strives to improve his own standard of living and he feels that his own inclination to better things is the disease of all inventors. The Subject also hopes to acquire, if necessary, a nationality by virtue of which he could feel that he actually belongs to a society. However he is ambivalent in this regard. He regards society as being anxious to stamp and label individuals and he would prefer to be an individualist outside of society than to be a member of society if he is required to conform. As was said before, his handlers would be wise not to label, to type or to try in any way to get the Subject to conform to society. He will run rings around around them like he did his mother. As regards his future outlook, the Subject is not entirely optimistic. He feels that he will never be able to reach his ideals because his material ideal (social reform), is so so distant and so difficult that he would need to lead-many lives in order to attain it. It might be unfair to designate him as a pessimist. As was said before, he is more of a skeptic and perhaps a cynic. Consequently, one should be careful as regards inculcating ideological or social motives. One should be content to accept his motives in their present state. Tampering with them would only result in disturbing the Subject and the relationship.

The Subject denies that he has any emotional interest in or emotional attachment to France at this time. Although it was likely that he was sentimentally patriotic before the war it is a fact that he has been branded as a criminal and has been deprived of certain civil rights and privileges. He now perhaps feels rejected and in turn is rejecting France. Nevertheless he strikes the examiner as a Frenchman in terms of the way he thinks, feels and acts. He is certainly not a Russian in his personality. He expresses himself freely, is discursive, voluble, and is able to carry on a conversation intensely and indefinitely on his topics of interest. This is typically French, but, in terms of his personality, it represents an oral characteristic. In other words he is inclined to express himself orally and is motivated to obtain love and affection together with other supplies by oral incorporation. What this means to you is that

-19-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

he is "mouthy" and he will eat you up if you are not careful or if you
get too close. Incorporation is the epitomy of control. Consequently,
if you allow him to incorporate you he's got control, not you. Be wary
and detached in this regard. He has already eaten up the case officer.

The Subject is currently involved in his avocation of inventions
and is the owner and exploiter of several patents. He has engaged the
financial and technical interests of several others in his inventions.
He currently presents the problem of being divided between the
invention business and continuing in the preliminary phases with us.
He claims that if he were to join us he would have to relinquish every-
thing to his business partners. This is probably true, and it is also
probably true that he would relinquish his invention interest but at the
same time, he presents this item in the fashion of a con man. It would
be wise to ignore this gambit.

Additional description of the personality includes the fact that
he reflects a superior intelligence, is capable of abstract conceptualizations
and is easily able to deal in symbols. He would have no difficulty as
regards the intellectual aspects of of training. However, in his training,
other things will have to be kept in mind. He is an narcissistic
character who feels that because he lacks the love of others he needs
to love himself. In other words, he is quite in love with himself
and thereby acts accordingly. He also tends to rationalize and to
offer socially acceptable reasons for his individualistic behavior
and for his past failures. He acts because he thinks he is right
and because he will succeed. He is quite egotistical in this regard.
He strives chiefly for emotional satisfaction. It would be wise to
remember also that he appears to be altruistic-but at the same time
he is selfish. He will do things for others and for the community
but will hope to get something out of it for himself. The altruistic and
selfish drives merge and he is motivated by both at the same time.
He needs to prove to others that he is capable of success and he is
self-confident in his power but is insecure that others may not regard
him as adequate. Basically he is an exhibitionist, but is too sophisticated
to brag or to display himself in a transparent manner. However, he
needs attention and is likely to do things in order to get attention. This
is what he has done in the past. He particularly strives not to be regarded
as bad or evil. He wants to be regarded as a person who has differences of

-20-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 59

opinions and conflicts with the social order. It would be fair to say that he is not a true criminal but is more of a neurotic character who expresses his conflicts and difficulties by non-conforming behavior. He is a stubborn fellow who does not like to be defeated and strives to conquer. Despite his tendencies to magical thinking he strives to be rational and realistic, but his strong emotional pressures get in his way. He experiences melancholy and depressive mood swings but maintains a light side and attempts to relieve his dysphoric feelings with lightness and humor. He relies heavily on the technique of humor to relieve tension and to avoid the demobilization of anxiety in interpersonal relationship. His humor may be regarded as a good index of his anxiety.

In light of the above the Subject's motivation for affiliation at this time is rather complex. However, on the surface it is positive, spontaneous, voluntary and tense. He is really on the shelf in Gap, is isolated, lonely, controlled in his movements, restricted in his aspirations and unable to realize freedom and to develop himself as an individual. Consequently, the assignment represents a unique opportunity to escape from his present level of existence and it is no wonder that he is pushing for a quick release from Gap. However, if he were released without the sufficient establishment of controls and the application of selection techniques he may prove to be a difficult handling problem in the future. It is recommended that his processing be slowed down to a hault and that security and other operational requirements be satisfied prior to lifting him out of Gap. Once he is taken out of Gap he, like the con man, is on first base, and, no matter how you slice it, he will have established himself in a bargaining position.

The Subject likes Americans for sentimental reasons. Although he realizes that the United States may have selfish political interests he is willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the Americans. He likes the liberty which exists in America and the fact that people are treated like individuals rather than as numbers. General ly his attitude toward the Americans is typically emotional and is understandable in terms of what has been said about his personality.

Although the Subject is a rank individualist and a non-conformist he realizes that he must cope with the community and must sacrifice for the good of the community. In particular, he would not like to harm

-21-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

others. In this regaid it is unlikely that the Subject has even committed physical assault nor is it likely that he would in the future.. No matter what the other person would represent to the Subject he would still be regarded as a human being whom the Subject would respect and would not harm. The Subject is not necessarily a hostile person. He will act out of exigency but will deliberately avoid being sadistic or wontonly cruel. This is of importance as far as the project is concerned. If the Subject were to find himself in a tight spot which required killing another person it is not likely that he would do so. It is more likely that he would attempt to resolve the situation by verbal machinations.

The Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research but as regards the execution of an operation, he prefers to be part of an organization. He knows he can rely upon himself when he is alone and that others have been unreliable in the past. However, if it is necessary for him to work with others he will accept it. It must be be kept in mind, however, that he would prefer to work alone. The Subject is likely to be loyal to a person whom he regards as superior and in the relationship he may even be critical of himself. In order to express his loyalty he would like to prove his usefulness to the superior but, at the same time, he would feel inadequate in that he would require the protection of a superior. In his initial contacts with a partner, the Subject would attempt to assume leadership on the team but if the partner were superior by virtue of intelligence and/or experience, the Subject would tend to follow. It is likely that he would be a better follower of an adequate leader than a leader of a less adequate person. The reason for this is that he is more of a a dependent than an independent person in terms of his interpersonal relationships. Furthermore, he is inclined to act on impulse and sentiment and consequently his judgement is questionable. In terms of ideal pairing, the Subject would work better with a more sober-minded, calculating and mature individual whom he would respect and with whom he would enjoy an informal but authoritative relationship

Prior to the last session of the preliminary examination on the 10th of January 1959 the Subject was routinely contacted by the French Police who were investigating his reasons for being in Paris at that time. As a result of this contact, the Subject was markedly apprehensive and preoccupied and was not able to freely devote himself to the psychological analysis as theretofore. The Subject's primary motive is, of course, self-preservation and since he is an extremely alert and vigilant individual he is likely to over-react and to become emotionally upset

-22-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 61

with such a provocation. Because of this it appears that the Subject
needs the guiding influence of a more mature experienced person who
is in more control of the situation. An additional point of interest is
that the Subject is capable of using such an experience as the visit by
the police as a device to control. For example, because of the visit
by the police, the Subject aborted the psychological analysis. He did
the same thing, in another way, on the preceeding contact with the
case officer. It is as if the Subject does not want us to get too close
and to learn too much about him. The third aspect of this behavior is
that the Subject for some reason or other consciously or unconsciously feels
he has "arrived" and is acceptable to our service. In other words, he
may act according to the opinion that a decision has been made in his
favor and consequently he sees no need for enduring a psychological
analysis. It is likely that he would have the same attitude toward a
security interrogation and as regards training.

As regards the general selection criteria for the project it
would appear that the Subject satisfies the requirements of intelligence
resourcefulness, mechanical talent, team-ability, infiltration-exfiltration
capability, good health, physical stamina, motivation, etc. However,
there are other factors which may or may not vitiate the positive features.
These factors are pertinent to areas such as security and handling. It is
recommended that before the Subject is removed from Gap that he be
administered a security examination in a controlled situation. Such
an examination should be conducted by a skilled and experienced
individual who is fluent in French, who is unbiased and objective and
who is not overly rigidas_regards his conventional standards. With
such an examiner, there is a fifty-fifty chance that the Subject would
satisfy security standards. The other problem area which remains is
that of handling, and unless this is thought out carefully and appropriate
personnel assigned, the hand will be quicker than the eye.

DRAFT
11 December 1958

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD

SUBJECT: David TZITZICHVILI - Red Sox Candidate

1. This is an indirect assessment of the above named individual based on a W-B test administered by a case officer in the field and on a PRQI. Subject apparently is being considered for a two-man mission of relatively short duration. The main questions about him seem to be:
   Can he learn to do what will be required? What would be his motivation?
   With what sort of person would he get on best in a two-man team? What special problems can be anticipated and avoided in his handling?

2. A brief telephone report was supplied to the headquarters case officer on 10 December 1958. It was stated that Subject possesses adequate intelligence, unusual social skills, and a propensity for getting what he wants without conscience. He is impulsive and surprisingly irrational in satisfying his personal desires. He will appear at first to have leadership skill and interest -- hence will probably just take over leadership of the team. In the long run, however, most persons who would be team-mates would become disenchanted and either reject him or take over themselves. Because of this man's social versatility, impulsiveness and freedom from conscience, he would be particularly difficult to control. That is, it would be difficult to ascertain that he

SECRET

201-233477


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 66

-2-

SECRET

actually did what he claimed to have done. His case officer would have
to be especially alert for double-dealing, careful to build in checks and
counterbalances, and tough and firm in handling style. Despite the
limitations noted it was felt that this man is worth the risks involved.

3. In comparison with agent candidates of the same nationality
   which we have assessed, Subject's intelligence is above average. No
   intellectual; he is nevertheless unusually well informed and unusually
   observant of what is going on around him. He is likely to be quite
   pedantic, but his thinking is not rigorous. He makes decisions im-
   pulsively and on analogy. He is therefore likely to appear more
   reasonable and better organized than he is in fact, and one is less likely
   to be prepared for his impulsive acts of bad judgment. To summarise
   the intellectual factor, he is intelligent, but he looks brighter, better
   educated and more capable of good judgment than he is in fact. How-
   ever, these are not intellectual limitations to his usefulness in the type
   of mission considered.

4. Perhaps this man's strongest skill is his versatility in
   playing social roles. If he so wants, he can make himself appear
   acceptable to a wide variety of people. He is accustomed to getting out
   of tight spots by exercising charm or "personality." At the same time,
   however, he can be very temperamental when his desires are frustrated

SEOCET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

SLORET

- 3 -

and when he feels he is crossed. He needs a lot of sensual experience and his sensuality and desire for emotional experience is not too well controlled. He especially likes new and novel experiences, which he will go after with little attention to the probable consequences.

5. This man is quite dependent on social activity and social relationships for amusement, support, and incentive. He may at times try to play the role of the independent, self-sufficient, lone-wolf, but he could not sustain such a role for long.. He must participate with people in a relatively emotional way. At the same time same time he is likely to be exceptionally suspicious of all the people he works with. He is not very realistic in his suspiciousness, and he is inclined to exaggerate clues and signs. With reference to the proposed mission, he is likely to express distrust of anyone who is introduced as a partner. Likewise it may be assumed he will try to take over the role of leader even though he has no particular leadership skills. This will This will present problems, because in our opinion over the long haul he would make a poor leader, for the following reasons: (a) he is not accustomed to playing any role consistently for a long period of time, (b) he is more dependent socially than he likes to admit, (c) his judgement is not consistent; he operates too much on impulse or sentiment and hence when the chips are down he cannot backstop his decisions with reasoned judgement.

SCORET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

6. It is our opinion that this man is unusually unencumbered by conscience. When he wants something, he takes it. When it requires him to cross a friend, he does so without guilt. If he looks ahead at consequences he does so in terms of "getting caught and being punished" rather than losing moral stature. He certainly feels little genuine loyalty to codes, institutions, or causes other than his own. He is more likely to remain loyal to a specific individual whom he respects or fears. The principal implications of these characteristics are: (a) he is not regarded as a promising candidate for polygraph testing -- the record is more likely to be misleading than in most cases (b)he will require a particularly firm straight forward, alert case officer whom Subject either respects or fears. A warm, friendly relationship here would likely result in Subject becoming exceedingly suspicious of his case officer, in efforts to manipulate the case officer, and disruption of relations owing to temperamental outbursts.

7. The best single characterization we can make of his motivation for the assignment is that if his personal desires happen to be-congruent with the purposes of the mission, then his motivation is appropriate. His interests might include desire for an exciting clandestine expereince and for social prestige, as well as for money. They certainly do not include any abstract political or ideological motives. The important


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

- 5 -

thing is that this man is unusually intent on satisfying his own whims and caprices whenever they are set-off, which makes him more inconsistent than one expects and hence more difficult to control.

B. Conclusion: Even more than the normal run of agent candidates, this man is solely out for himself. Coupled with this characteristic is his social skill and his ability to get away with gratifying his own desires irrespective of the feelings or interests of others. This indicates peculiarly difficult control problems, which in our opinion require an unusually competent, alert, strict, even authoritarian case officer.

Despite the number of negative characteristics discussed in this report, it is nevertheless our opinion that this man is still worth considering providing he has the minimum requirements of language, access to target, and cover. He has the requisite intelligence and very useful social skills.

He can get away with activities which would be disturbing or upsetting to other people, and this would appear to be a major qualification.

INDEXING CAN BE JUDGED BY

1.  Approval to contuct and assess Subject was given in reference which also approved our proposal that Peter K. Winship ascoapery Kewens and the undersigned on this job in order that he would be able to carry to Headquarters his personal impressions of Subject.

2.  We arrived in Paris on 13 October where we discussed our plans with John P. Platipodis who informed us that the Paris Station had no objections to our proceeding as we proposed. The undersigned travelled as Maj. Michael C. Long; Newens and Winship travelled in true name.

3.  We rented a car in Paris and drove to Gap, arriving before noon on 14 October. The remainder of the day was spent in familiarizing ourselves with the tom and locating the house where Subject was reported to live. Because none of us spoke Premch without a noticeablo Anglo-Saxon accent, we did not wish to visit the partient or subject's brother and risk meeting the brother or sister-in-law who would easily be able to detect that we were not Frenchmen. Therefore, the under signed drove to Vaynes about 40 km. away where he got an older woman working in a small inn to put through a telephone call for us. The woman had no idea what she was doing and was not suspicious. She spoke with Subject's sister-in-law who said that Subject was no longer "sleeping there but was expected to visit the house at about 2100 hours. Consequently, the undersigned returned to Gap whore Winship and Nesens were on hand to surveil Swjeat's house. A second call to the house of Subject's brother was put through at sbout 2130 hours from a different tom also about 40 km. from Cap. The man who made the call for us learned that subject was plarning to visit Paris, and that it was not known whether he had left.

4.  Not wishing to risk missing Subject altogether, wo decided to call at the apartment of Subject's brother on the cerning of 15 Cetoter after 9:30 when it could be expected that the brother would have left home for his office. The undersigned mzda tise call, spoke with the sister-in-law (who, we subsequently learned, tock the undersigned for an Englishman). The conversation lested perhaps 15 minutes. The eister-in-law gave us Subject's present address where he is not registered and told us where he eats lunch daily. While Newens and Winship counter-surveilled the site, the undersigned waited for Subject outside the restaurant where he takes his meals until Subject approached at about 1245 hours. Subject had already been alerted that a non-native French speaking person was looking for him and recognized the undersigned at enco. An introduction was made, Subject was clean the photographs which AEPALDLE hed taken and accepted these as proof of the undersigned's authenticity. Subject said he was planning to leave that night for a two day wait to Paris on bothcca. It suggested that Subject, in order to savo fare and no that we ghould: have an extended opportunity to discuss "certain matters" with hin, might prefer to drive with ca. Subject accepted this suggestion and arrangements were made to pick him up in front of a cafo on the cut- skirts of Gap where he is temporarily lodged.

5.  Subject was not by the undersigned at 2000 hours and told that the undersigned was accompanied by two colleagues. Shortly thereafter

Newens and Winship were picked up and we departed for Paris. During the trip we had an opportunity to converso with Subject about his early life, family problems, etc. As it turned out the long drive gave us an ideal opportunity to draw out Subject about himself and his present circumstances. We arrived in Paris on 16 October at 0700 hours.

Subject dropped near the house of Identity A. Arrangements were made to meet him at 1600 hours in the vicinity of the Gare Montparnasse. During this session with Subject, PII prographic information was obtained. After the four hour testing, we took Subject to dinner which gave us further opportunity to talk to him. Between our arrival in Paris and our meeting with Subject at 1600 hours, he had been occupied with business affairs so that he had not slept at all, was tired, and wanted to break up early.

6. We next met Subject on 17 October at 1230 hours. Subject had spent the morning winding up his business affairs. After a quick lunch, we took another room at the California Hotel where we talked with Subject until after 1700 hours. During this meeting Subject was given the Wechsler Bellevue test. We also discussed future contact and in- structed him to have a full medical examination done, including a chest x-ray, and sent to us as soon as convenient. Likewise Subject was instructed to write us a detailed autobiography running not less than 200 pages or so from about 1939. Subject paled at the detail we requested but said he would make an effort.

7. Subject still carries a special identity card which means he is restricted to the Department of Hautes Alpes. However, he is able within 48 hours to get a special pass from the police which permits him to visit any city in France up to seven days and if he had demonstrable good reasons for a longer visit, he believes arrangements could be made. Subject believes that for about French francs 50,000 he could acquire a French identity document bearing no restriction. This would take time; the money would be needed for legal counsel and bribes. We discussed with Subject the possibility of visiting Germany for 7 days including travelling time on a false German identity document. Being an old hand at forgery, Subject was enchanted with the idea and quite confident he would be able to pull it off. This was discussed because we thought it might be better and more convenient to bring Subject to Frankfurt for an LCFLUTTER examination and assessment rather than to do this in Paris. Subject cannot get legal permission to go outside of France.

8. Contact Arrangements:

(a) Subject will be notified by letter that we wish to meet him. The latter should be addressed to Identity B. The letter should be written in German and should give (1) time and date of meeting (the site will NOT be mentioned); (2) an English phrase must be in- cluded at the end of the letter, e.g. "Good Luck." The signature is immaterial. N.B.: Not less than five days and preferably seven should be allowed from the time the letter is posted until the day Subject is to be met.

(b) Meeting place in Paris is the Cafe Georges VI, rue Faubourge St. Honore, just off the rue Royal, Place de la Concorde.

(c) Alternate times for the meeting are three hours after the original meeting time, and then two hours later, i.e. five hours after the original meeting time.

(d) If Subject is unable to come to Paris, he will:

(1) Write or telegraph Identity A stating he is unable to come. The person meeting Subject will go to this address and in- quire about M. David; he should be told M. David was unable to come.

(2) Thereupon a telegram will be sent to Subject in Gap in which a telephone number will be included. Sign the message Michel.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 83

(3) Upon receipt of the telegram, Subject will telephone and ask to speak with Michel Long, whereupon he will receive further instructions.

(4) In the event no message is received at Identity A, a telephone call to Identity C should be put through by a native French speaker who will ask for H. David, pretending ho is one of David's friends.

(e) Subject will write to Identity D. He will post his letter in a plain envelope to Identity A who will post the inner addressed envelope from Paris.

9. Re DIR 41763, dated 20 September 1958: Subject is completely willing to repatriate to the Soviet Union at our behest. We believe ho is sincere in this contention. He could be moved to Germany using a false document to get him across the border for a few days, but if we were to do this, we would incur the risk that Subject might be picked up or might invent some incident in order to claim that it would be impossible for his to return to France. Subject does not like Gap and very much wants to leave. Although we did not go into the matter deeply, we may assume that there is no possibility that Subject on a REDSOX mission could recruit his relatives because no one in the family seems to know where they live. The sister who repatriated is supposed to be living in Moscow but the last letter from her was received several years ago.

10. As attachments please find the following:

(a) PRQ I sent under separate cover
(b) Newens assessment of Subject sent under
(c) Friganza's assessment of Subject sent under 14/92
(d) The Wechsler-Bellevue results sent herewith in one copy to AEACRE only
(e) Identity list

11. Peter K. Winship will be able to give AEACRE his view in person. We have told Subject that he cannot expect an early decision on his employment with us. We told his that within about 30 days we would drop him a letter acknowledging the receipt of the medical report which we asked him to send us and informing him of a tentative date when we might wish to meet his in Paris again. Before undertaking further to assess, LCFLUTTER, and interrogate Subject, we would like a tentative expression of Headquarters interest in the case. It would seem that there is sufficient information on which to make such a decision.

# General Debriefing and Assessment of Subject

1. Introduction:

The Subject was contacted in Cap by Frigansa. General familiarisation with him was undertaken en route to Paris (by car) on the right of 15/16 October 1950. Subsequently he was set in Paris on 16 October (afternoon) and on 17 October. On the last day the Wechsler Bellevue was given also further meeting- and communications' arrangements made.

Because of the time-limitation (he was unable to stay in Paris also he had some business of his own to transact), the debriefing and assessment had to be necessarily held to general terms, the main consideration given to Subject's over-all life-run the main stress put on the assessment for REDSOX suitability.

There were no personal or security problems. From the beginning Subject was willing, most eager, and co-operative. He is also willing to co-operate in the future and would not hesitate to take a long trip in order to meet us again.

2. General Biography:

a. Pre WWII

Subject is a Georgian national. Both his parents were Georgians. He was brought to France by his parents, who fled from the Soviet Union. Until WWII they lived in Paris or surrounding areas. For one or the other reason they moved frequently. This might have been due to the profession of his father, who was a graduate mining-engineer and who probably held an administrative or engineering job in France.

Owing to the above, Subject changed schools accordingly. He said that he never had trouble in his studies because of a good memory and fast retention. Consequently, he was usually bored because of frequent repetitions. Owing to boredom and possibly to some sense of opposition, he became usually a nuisance to the teachers. Subject told us that once he had to be transferred to another school, because he got into a violent argument with a teacher. His mother was quite concerned about his behaviour and took him to a psychiatrist (from Subject's narrative it is not clear what the diagnosis was).

In his free time he liked to perform odd jobs, such as, for example, fixing bicycles or helping out in electrical repair jobs or installation work. He also loved to invent gadgets and odd machines.

Undoubtedly Subject had an inclination towards technical matters. On the other hand, he had a tremendous drive to be financially independent, to make money, and to get ahead in life. It also seems that he did not like to be employed by a person and that he always strived for self-employment.

After graduating from school he attended several engineering colleges. At Breguet he studied electro-engineering. Subsequently he enrolled in the technicum for cinematography. It is a fact that Subject had studied a lot; on the other hand, it appears that he did not graduate from any of these technical institutions.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 86

Pago 2

Approximately in 1940, Subject enlisted in the Forbim Legion. Ho was accepted in Peris and sent via Lyon-arseille-Port St. Jern to Sidi-bel-Ables. February-August 19 ho was staticred in Tunesia (Susa).

From Subject's narrative it may be assinad that he was not a bad soldier and that he actually liked to serve. He said that he had been suggested for officers training bit that this did not ratorialize (possibly because France ves cccupied in the meantime). Subject's highest rank was that of a Pic (or equivalent thereof). According to hin this rank has som prostice in the Legion.

In the saza unit with Subject there were atout 12 Georgians, a number of Armenians, soce Spaniards, and Jews. Subject knew of a so-called Coorzien Company which subsequently was encircled by the Gorcens; however, he did not belong to this company. The occupation of France in April/May 1911 endat his military career. He was demobilized and returned to Parie.

b. During W

After the discharge from the Legion Sulject felt a great desire to fight for France, He told us that he loved Prance and that he wanted to do something for his chosen homeland, However, it seems that he never got around to doing anything about this ambition. He cald jokingly that combers of the resistence were not listed in telephone directories, and therefore he did not know how το make contact with them, in the owner hand it appeasia that he did not try very hard and that his love for independance (perschal Independence) was greater than his wish to join any collectiva maistaica activity. Thus he decided to act on his own.

Ho told us that at this time there was some recruitment of labour-forces in France for Garusny. He decided to enroll as labourer. He wont to a certain office in Paris and was sent in due course to Germany. For a while he worked in a synthetic gacoling plant in Beelitz near Ferlin, Su ject said that this was the only tire that he was actually steadily explosed. Because the Georplans ware rather esteered by the Germans, he had certain freedons. For a while he lived with a carried German woman and renorally sparking, it appears that he had a couple of other girl-friends on the side. For some reason or other he also worked in a mainitions plent. When playing " (as he told us) with a small hand cronade, ora of his fingers was crippled.

It is obscure how he obtained another job in Germany, but it is probably a fact that he worked as a driver for the SKK (National Socialist Party Motorized Corps).

It is felt that Subject actually went carly into the black marketing racket. He told ce that he had traveled extensively and had been in occupied Poland (Lodz for example). Ha tormed thees travelo as "fun" becauso to had enough money to spend (ergo black market). It might also be possible that h traveled in conjunction with the forced documents business he had begun.

It is not quite clear what prompted hla to start forfing passes into and out of Germany. During the intervies he claimed that his at was to help Imprisoned into pet back to Trance. Hovortheless, although a plausible reason (itas mentioned that he wanted to help France), it is felt that the ulterior motivos right still have been love of excitement and v to mako monay. Technically spocking Subject miss have been an accomplished forger. He told us that his past studies at the cinematographic technicia had riven hin valuable techniques to be applied to photo-mechanical ferging of documents, stamps, and cachota.

It is folt that he must have had accomplices. Nevertheless in clai that he did not wer with the franch Protatanca althcuri it sitt be ponattle and probablo that they gave his arm or the other order to fill. At a ceri point Subject ancto arout working rough intendiariosand cut-out.

Generally in it still aight be possible that ho actually verked with the French Realutaren bat does not wish to tell us.

Prior to a trip to Germany (Subject was at the time in Paris on business) be tas arrested by the Gorin regular police. He explaind to is that to had worked with a girl the acted an intersediary in cortalh docuentation affairs. It appears fat the girl was unwittingly involved with Carmen police (It is ret quite clear from Subject's story whether its worked for the Coreena wittirely or tesittingly) and had passed on information concerning Subject'a activities.

Be it as it may, Subject was arrested on the railroad station which had bean closed-off by Corman polica especially for this operation, He was apprehended in the presence of the girl, fo had a pistol with him which complicated matters slightly.

Because the case pas political, he was not held unduly by the criminal Investigation branch but passed on to the Gestapo. Subject was brought to Berlin, where he was Interrocated for several months at Cestepo IQ. Es told us that be had given then the information desired and that he had never bean beaten or maltreated, Fe mentioned that his interrogator or interrogators chanced their apparel frequently, sometimes sppearing in civilian clothes, at tinas ir navy or aray uniforms.

Bavas questioned about the techniques caployed and later was requested to consult en document fergeries) 1.6. recognizing forceries eutaitted to him anong penuine documents, Subject told us that this was almost impossible, because his forceries were so well made that it was hard to tell the fake from the real stuff. Nevertheless, ha endsavoured to oblige and pointed out some documents of doubtful genuineness.

Later he was brought before court (it is not clear whether actually or in absentia) and given a defence layer. It is not clear whether he was santenced to death, however, it might be understood from his inferencos.

Subject was coved from jail to jail and iron concentration camp to concentration camp. He told us that sons of the time he spent in colitary and some of the time in comunal cells. Occasionally ho vas snacled hand and foot. Towards the end of the war he krew that exscutions were carried out on rasse. lie resorted to a little ruse do guerre and announced to the Gormans that his father and he had invented a motor that could run without gasolira. Fo also made it known that although he was able to draw one part of this coter, the other essential part was with his father, who in turn had cached it somewhere.

Subject know that his father could not be contacted because the part of Austria be was in at the tie wes occupied (lilorated territory). However, he was willing to draw the mechanism for his captors. It appears that the whole idaa scened attractive to the Cermans and that they demonstrated great interest (this was the period of the Wunderiaffon). Subjeet thinks that this saved him from Lapending execution. Shortly afterwards he was liberated by components of the advancing US Army.

c. After WWII until Fresant

It airit te chronologically incorrect, but at this point it should be nontioned that Subiect's father decided to be repatriated. As far as Subject knows, his father is still in Soviet Georfia and night hold an enginsaring Job. A fact is that his father had written to hio (quite a whilo aco) and requested books, on refrigeration-engineering, Subject's sister did not u to let the father go alone, so she repatriated with him. She was accompanied by her husband, who also wes a Georgian and who had been a zachor of the Car arced forces. file sister's husband imediately upon arrival in the Soviet Un Lon van asat to Siboria.

Subject began working in Paris. Fa was employed by the firm of Jaques
Gore, which specialized in making models of houses, lie stayed with this
fira approxately from 1947-1948 and was paid about Fr. Ps. 120 an Scar.
Thore he cat his future wife PARYON, Rino, who originated from Besançon
(her parents have a prain business in Besançon and own a house and car.).

Subject was married in 1919. Among Subject'o sequaintances wes a
certain ADAM, Jaques (about six months older than Suoject). It ameere that
ADAN convinced Subject of the necessity to make more money. Because making
great quantities of ronay was quite difficult, they decided to commit rob-
beries. It appears that Subjont was not against this idea and did not oppose
Adam, who had been a former schoolmate of his and with whom he had lived
together in Versailles.

Their first objective was a jovelsr's store in the rue de Bec (Vems).
It seems that they broke in without much trouble and got away with Fr. frs.
1,000,000 in jewelry. Adam organized the sale of the loot. They netted
Fr. frs. 250,000 each. It should be noted that the police had no cire as
to who the culprits had been.

Approximately one year later Adan appeared at Subject's house and
blackmailed him (in front of his wife) to commit another robbery. The
objective was another jewelry store. However, the proprietor of the shop
harmaned to be thara (or actually the robbery had to be committed in daytime).
Subject did not wish to get into a fight, so they beat a hasty retreat.

Approximately a year later the chosen objective was a bank. Adam and
Subject watched the barking house fron a truck which was equipped with a
periscope. The truck was so parked as to rako it possible to observe the
toller's counter and this to count the incoming money. At one point Adam
wanted to tegin the hold-up when an old women brought about Fr. frs.
1,000,000. Subject. however, was against it (he told us that he had thought
of his mothar). Nevertheless, the hold-up tock place. Both friends entered
the bank. Subject jumped on the counter with drawn pistol. Kirscalously
both got away. Some time later Adam was apprehended cainly because ba
started spending money. Adan confessed. Subject at that time was on his
way to Gap toesther with his wife, and daughter, Elizabeth. He told his
wife the story and asked her to flee to Switzerlend. Subject himself
decided to attempt to cross the Spanish borier, Fe, having been recognized
by a chepherd, wan apprehended in the mountains. As Subject indicated
during the interview, ha had not been actually too caper to floe the country.

During the ensuing investigation the two first crimes were confessed
by Subject. Fe was centenced to solitary isprisonmont (a tochnical torm in
France which precludos parole).

Subject served his term in various rather notorious prisons of France.
It appears that he road quite a lot (if and when it was possible) and also
vorced at one of his inventions: a machine for making caribeard bares. This
machine was actually built for one of the prison administrations and put
into operation at the prison factory.

When he got out of Jail, his wife's family corranicated to him that thoy.

# DISPATCH

EGFA 24034
Page 5

Some tiro año Subject wrote a criza novel which until now is unpublished. It appears that also ho tried to get eplejent with the lens Bureau having had an acquaintance who had some contacts there. Subject is not satisfied with his present situation. He has no position in life, and besides, he is unable to nove, and that annoys him grestly.

## 3. Accessmont:

Subject appears to be quite a complex personality. Based on so brief an acquaintance it is still hard to tell wat is vaneor and what is actual make-up. It is evident that part of his present reasoning might have evolved in jail. Nevertheless, jall may be regarded as only a step in Subject's evolution.

when considering the sketchy blography, we soe that sometinss in the past he felt allegiance towards France regarding it as his hopeland. If this vas true in the past, it is not any longer the cass. Ne does not like France and the French, although his recent experience in Jall was his can fault. Moreover, he has forfeited the right to become a citizen and with it the possibility to fashion his career to his own liking. However, this officer does not know whether this is a driving factor in his decision or wish to perform dangerous work, It is felt that Subject was to a certain extent always an adventurer. He was accustomed to "Love around" from childhood on. Besides, he was always determined to ret abead in life and to make money. His activity during the war was positively not dictated by ideological motivation only. There was a definite gain to be had in the farfory flold. If his actions now appear to be presented as purely ideological mas, this cannot be completely true, because at the same time Subject states that he enjoyed making money and spending it.

There seams also to be in hin a like for the clandestine and illegal combined with a satisfaction derived from general disaster as for examplo war. Subject told us that he had en opportunity to see artillery in action and that he liked to see then fire. He also liked to see flaming houses. Yet, on the other hand, he kept himself out of any active participation in military action and rather concentrated on the task of producing good for geries and making money.

Politically speaking he hates Russiens. Re said that the German theory of the Untermansch is true in regard to the Russians, Subject says that he dialikes Comainish but that Russians are for him the enemies par excellence. Otherwise he has no national or racial prejudices, He says that ho doos not practice any religion, however, he added, "Felieve in your God; I shall bolieve in mino".

Subject is an excellent conversationalist and definitely has the ability to get along with most personalities without actually accopting their ideas or ways of thinking. He has read a lot, however, it is folt that his knowl- adre of scientific natters (ho has clothed to have such knowledge) is based on para-scientific literature which he reads indiscriminately.

Subject is an individualist. He is probably rather ruthless in forthor- ing his personal interests. His present ambition is to be somebody in life.

It is this officer's opinion that Subject is rather suitable for RADSOX. lle tap the traits of a born clandestine operater and a liking for the dangereus and illegal. Physically he is healthy and enduring (proven by his long stay in various rough fails). The Leams casily and is asstellating easily. On the other hand, his handling airht satiras present probleme, because to cay act impulsively and rashly believing that stat he does la the right thing to do. It is this officer'e fealing that Subject nicht oomotions not think pattore over proferring to make anap decisions ant to act accordingly.

4. Recommendations:

It is recommended that Subject be assessed by our psychiatrists in Washington. It is this officer's opinion that any purely psychometrical assessment will not yield the necessary results. Generally speaking, Subject has desirable traits and aptitudes for REDSOX or other intelligence tasks.

Preliminary Assessment of

1. Brief Biography

Subject is a 40-year-old Georgian emigro living in Gap, Hautes Alpes, France. Together with his parents, brother and sister he moved from the disintegrat.ng.Georgian Republic in 1921 to France where he has lived ever since, except for about three years during World War II when he worked voluntarily in Germany as a seal-skilled laborer. He joined the French Foreign Legion in 1940 and was demobilized in 1941, having served for the most part in North Africa. While in Germany he developed a skill at forging documents which he used to help French officers to escape to France. He was arrested, convicted and jailed for about a year and a half. After the war he returned to Paris. In 1946 and 1947 Subject committed two armed robberies. In 1949 he robbed a bank in Paris, subsequent to which he was caught, ocnvicted and sentenced to ten years, which was later reduced to five by the terms of a general amnesty. Since his release in 1955 Subject has lived in Gap where his boother lives and works as a moderatoly successful architect. Subject was married in 1947, divorced in 1950 while in prison. He has a daughter, born before his arrest, and a son, born while he was in prison.

2. Comments on Contact and Debriefing

Subject was contacted by Anthony H. Friganza in Gap on 15 October 1958, having been assessed and prepared for the contact by AEPADDLE, an old friend of Subject's, in February 1958. Shortly after the first meeting with Friganza, Subject met Patrick B. Newens and Peter K. Win-ship. In the course of mootings lasting a total of about 22 hours he was debriefed and a preliminary assessment, including a Wechsler-Bellevue psychological test, was made. There was no difficulty in authenticating ourselves with Subject and in the course of our con-versations, we got no indication that Subject did not answer the questions put to him in a frank and open manner. If anything, Subject perhaps tried to please for it is clear that Subject would like a job, almost any job, with us because his present situation in Gap is re-strictive and holds no promise of a futuro. But, Subject by nature la not easily debriefed or interrogated because he is glib and seems quite naturally to answer specific questions in a general way. Noteworthy and indicative is the fact that the only birth date subject knew наз his own; he did not know his parents', his wife's or even his brother's. This is not suspicious or unique, but it Indicates that it is difficult to pin him down to hird faste. when dealing with unpicasantnesces or touchy matters, Subject is apt to philosophize as he did when he waв asked questions about the current relationship of his brother and hia new wife. Rather then give opinions on facts about the girl, ho noted that marriage is sixty percent love and forty percent comedy, which is very Gallic and probably true, but only in a round-about way at best does it express Subject's personal views on the question under dis.. cussion. No attempt to ba tough with Subject was made and there was DO occasion when we conveniently could have challenged his sincerity or verselty, so we do not krow how Subjeet boves in each circumstances. We would guess that he would adopt a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. lie would not be easily bullied.

3. Education, Languages and Cultural Standing

Subject probably has a better-than-averege fomal education for a Prenciaan who did not and never planned to go cn to a university. He כל a fair lay knowledge of history but is all inferred in dcretles Jubject is umething of a scientific dillutarit, Internated in the alan, gadgets, electrical and mechanical, and probably the gamit of calcatifio and pseudo-solentific things and idees. His knowledge 18 brod but not dosp; in nude things it is about as deep as Fopular Restintos, but in others he knows vanaidembly are.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 92

Subject claims to speak Georgian with native fluency. He may speak it well but we venture that it is not the same language currently being spoken in Georgia, this probably being so if only because he has never been to Georgia. There is no indication he uses the language much, if at all. He speaks, reads and writes French with native fluency. Actually, French is his native language; at lease he calculates in French. He speaks and reads German well and is capable of expressing himself quite fully in it. Ho understands English and can say simple things in it. Subject says he is able to understand and speak Spanish well enough to get along.

Culturally Subject is French. His mannerisms are French, as aré his habits. If there is anything particularly Georgian about Subject, it is not noticeable. We would guess that Subject was brought up in not too well-to-do middle class circumstances but under the influence of his parents who had had a much better, possibly even prosperous, past.

4. Character and personality: It is safe to describe Subject as independent and as a man who instinctively prefers to take his chances relying on his own abilities and resources in order to avoid compromising his independence by assuming commitments. He is a long wolf type. We guess that Subject behaves this way partly because he has an exaggerated notion of his competence, and partly because he is impatient with delay and with people who are less quick or able than hộ. Even though Subject needs people and likes company, he does not want to have his affairs, particularly his business affairs, dependent on others. There are several points which support this: By his own admission (which, incidentally, may be quite misleading because he may have quite incorrect opinion of himself) Subject as a student was obstreperous, impatient, and consistently so. As a voluntary worker in Germany when he seems to have struck out on his own is further evidence. Now, rather than taking a steady job of some kind which suits his abilities, Subject is once again striking out on his own, although his record as a convict mitigates this because he has no choice. One of the reasons why Subject does this is that he has an insatiable desire to strike it rich or at least to achieve success and stature. This desire to attain something may be related to the comparison he must be forced to make between his record and that of his brother: His has been unruly, irregular, troublesome, and he has attained very little; his brother became an officer in the French any (even though he was foreign born) and is now a 80-80 successful architect. Also, we suspect that we have not yet gotten the full story on Subject's marriage and divorce. Perhaps Subject married unwisely, lost face with his family, and/or was considered a low type mate by his wife's family even before he was arrested.

One of the underlying reasons why subject is so independent is that he is impatient. In conversation we noticed that hớ did not wait for questions we wished to put to him to be fully fonaed. He tends to interrupt in order to supply usually interesting and sometimes even pertinent information. He seems unable to bide his time. He doubt that Subject has any deficable moral or other standards. In any given instance he either rationalizes the facts. in order to reach a conclusion which appealed to him to begin with, or he simply overlooks the certain significant issue. Still, Subject is not amorel or a criminal type. We believe he knows right and wrong, sometimes considers whather any given act would be right or wrong and/or ciccont. His trouble is that not having any fira base point lesis him into coral contradictions which he can't solve and frequently is unaware of because he dcesn't really care. We doubt that Subject's corals concerning drink, women, gasbling and the other vices differ greatly at nest frea the average person of approximately the came background. To repeat, it is not that Subject has no standards his are just different and peculiarly his con.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

We believe that Subject is sentimental but is ashamed of being
so; he cakes a Joke of it. He wants to be liked by people and realizes
that cost peoplo find him interesting, entertaining and attractive.
Wo think that Subject unconsciously gives an important place to
comradeship. He can influence poople and be influenced by them. Ho
is mature about such things but still we think he would stick by a
friend in trouble, perhaps to the point of foolishness. Because
Subject has the winning personality he does, he has never been obliged
to retain friends and/or acquaintances because he knows he will al-
ways be able to find new ones. Interestingly enough Subject more than
once distinguished between a friend and an acquaintance, and in so many
words stated that he has had very fow friends as such.

Subject dezonstrated that he is able to reason and to do so
very well. He saw the solution of logical and algebraic problems he
was given remarkably quickly. While attempting to solve these problems,
Subject reasoned well enough but showed that his memory is perhaps not
as good. Subject knew his own date of birth and hardly any other; of
course, he had no interest in the others.

Subject is perceptive and is able to combine his perception
with his ability to reason. He made several remarks which indicated
that he saw through the behaviour of certain personalities, political
questions, etc., which were discussed. Subject is observant but we
did not have sufficient time with him to know whether his powers of
observation are excellent or simply above average.

Subject has a winning personality and is quite capable in
dealing with people. He listens well, talks rapidly and at length
without attempting to monopolize the conversation. He is quite will-
ing to climb out on a conversational limb, listen when he hears someone
else speak up who is apparently better inforried, and asks questions
if his interest has been aroused. We would guess that Subject would
be particularly well suited to dealing with the public. He nicely
combines pseudo-attentiveness and Gallic charm.

We doubt that Subject has much resolve and almost certainly
would not stick to a boring, difficult job for very long. We doubt
he would simply quit in a huff; he would far prefer to rationalize and,
if necessary, to manufacture excuses for release. Connected with this
is the possible character weakness in Subject concerning his reliability
to fulfill any given set task. We doubt that he would oversleep or
get drunk but if he personally did not understand and appreciate the
Importance of the job, he would be inclined to let it slide or ignore
it. An excellent point in subject's favor is that he could not be
brow beaten or easily dominated. For instance, we doubt that even the
threat of physical torture would force Subject to tell something he
did not wish to say. To precludo any such crisis, Subject would be
glib, second guess his interrogators, invent facts or at least re-
arrange them to suit whatever purpose he might have in mind. Subject
could probably be dominated by a man of superior intelligence (at
least considerably superior to his) who spoke native French and was
sufficiently informed about Subject's background so that he could
catch cut Subject in any one of his evasions.

Subject is a materialist because he has the idea that material
success is necessarily the passport to respectability, social success,
happiness and a host of other such abstract Imponderables. Not that
Subject is too unhappy or emoticnally ambalanced at the pressnt time;
ho enjoys the very carefree life he leads. We think that because
Subject has this desire for material gain and hence respectability,
the promise of a sizeable financial reward would by itself be sufficient
to win his loyalty and holchearted cooperation. This is not to say
that the anti-Communist struggle for good and against evil Eeans
nothing to him. It does, of course, and he might undertake dangerous.
work for the love of adventure, but he would do so with a great deal
more verve and conviction if he were sure of the pot of gold at the
end of the road.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 94

# 5. Resourcefulness and Adaptability:
We believe Subject is extremely resourceful and would be so in nearly any circumstance. Ho is glib-and he can talk. We doubt he is a slate to preconceptions. Because his coral standards are neither well defined and are elastic his reasoning and behaviour is not constricted by then. He is a preg- matist through and through. He is also a realist. We thought Subject's appraisal of his own position, possibilities for the future, his past, etc., were disarmingly accurate and candid. However, Subject is 40 years old and we doubt that he could be made to change his ways, at least not for very long. We think he would work hard at learning any new job just so long as he found it interesting, adventurous, and/or materially rewarding. He has turned his hand to a lot of things and is experienced at being obliged to experiment and adapt himself to new situations in or order to avoid trouble, discomfort, and work.

# 6. Willingness and motivation:
Concerning a REDSOX mission and/or a repatriation mission under our direction, we think Subject is sincere and correct in claiming he is a willing candidate. We doubt that he would attempt to beg off at the last comment. He is no physical coward. However, Subject is willing for REDSOX because in it he sees a way out of the bind he is now in. He can't leave France because there is nowhere to go. Because he has a criminal record he is unable to build a future for himself in France, and he is unable to travel in order to look for possibilities. He has been exiled to a hick town where he is paroled to his brother who is to some extent responsible for his good behaviour. So basically Subject is willing because it is a way out. There is an element of adventure in his willingness but any adventurous ideas would immediately evaporate if Subject were a French citizen and had a financially successful business. Subject is anti-Communist, etc., we feel quite certain, but he is either too faded, or too mature, ot too cynical to permit such notions to play much of a role. If he were given the idea that KUBARK demands fiery anti-Communist motivation, Subject would do his best to convince us that that is what he is. Subject in so many words said that one of his prime desires was to get out of France, and as a first choice to go to the United States. The promise of American citizenship would weigh in heavily as a factor in Subject's willingness to undertake almost any REDSOX mission regardless of the danger. In a word, Subject's motivation is material.

# 7. Handling of Subject:
The handling of Subject from this point on must be ruthless and calculated. We think that Subject would be neither shocked nor offended by such handling; as a matter of fact he probably expects it. We would recommend against paying Subject more than the absolute minimum he needs to survive until the mission had been completed. If Subject is removed from France, some means must be found to convince Subject that we can dispose of him to an area or a place at least as disadvantageous to Subject as his present one is. In other words, don't give Subject the carrot until he has done the job. Subject would not necessarily need to be trained in French as this is the only language in which he is perfectly fluent. Even though his Georgian is very good, it is not current and he could be used only on a black mission. He appears to be physically rugged and in good condition. Very arduous and exacting training would be salutary.

We do not think that Subject would be an awkward disposal problem if he ware transferred to AEACRE for training and his mission were subsequently cancelled. Given some money and a job, ha could be resettled in any South American country without difficulty.

# 8. Recommendation:
(a! We hope there is sufficient information on Subject now recorded on which Headquarters will be able to decide if Subject is of interest for REDSOX or not. If he is, he should be further debriefed and Interrogated and given the LCFLUTTER test. The LCFLUTTER test could be given in Paris or Frankfurt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 95

If it is given in Paris there will be a less favorable climate, some risk will be taken that we might have difficulties with the French, and we might face several operational problems in getting a secure house, etc.

If the test is given in Frankfurt, Subject would necessarily need to travel here on a phoney German Reisenuswels (which we consider he could use properly from the language point of view). The principal risk in bringing Subject to Prankfurt is that Subject might have an accident or he might manufacture some reason not to return. In either case we might have an awkward disposal problem on our hands and we might be barrassed vis-a-vis the Germans.

We would prefer to bring Subject to Prankfurt because we believe that Subject is bona fide and would be unlikely to double cross us.

(b) We wish to emphasize that this is a preliminary assessment and recommendation. With that caveat we would recommend Subject for a fully black REDSOX mission which requires: (1) able bodiness, (2) superior intelligence (considering the calibre of person who is likely to be willing) and reasoning power, (3) willingness to undertake an extremely hazardous mission, (4) no native Russian fluency, (5) basic technical, mechanical, and pseudo-scientific abilities. We would hesitate at this point to recommend Subject for a repatriation mission even though he is willing because we question whether Subject has the resolve or patience for such a task.

## MOTIVATION AND CONTROL

### SECTION II

1. ESTIMATE SUBJECT'S MOTIVATION: (Be detailed. If possible, cite evidence. Do not use stock comments such as "anti-Communist.")

1. Pursuant to Reference C, the Station requested UN.EAVE traces on the Sub- ject of Reference A. The resulting report has been translated and is attached hero- with.

2. The Station concurs with the suggestion that the REDSOX section of FOB undertake the recruitment and processing of the Subject. For reasons that need not be discussed in detail in this dispatch, the undersigned has become extensively known in the Georgian colony in true name, and plans to continue spotting and assessing Georgian candidates for other SR activities in France. The Georgian colony in France is small and the Station already has ample evidence that news of intelligence activity within the colony often becomes cortion knowledge very quickly. Therefore, it is best to risk an unknown outside asset for something so unequivocally compromising as a REDSOX recruitment.

3. Attached also is one of two copies of Subject's signature which was ob- tained by AEPADDIE as a means of establishing bona fides (see OFPW - 20982).

4. The Station will be glad to discuss the various problems of this case with FRIGANZA or anyone else designated by F03. It is requested that Headquarters advise what further action will be required of the Paris Station.

SECRET
HOFORN/CONTINUED CONTROL

TZITZICHVILI, David (Alias DATOWA)

1. TZITZICHVILI was born on 20 December 1919 at Tiflis in Georgia (USSR) of Simon and Harie KANTCHELI. He is also recorded as being born on 12 July 1918. In 1948 he married Renée PARROT; they had two children and lived at 28 rue Catanis in Paris. He later divorced her.

2. TZITZICHVILI earned the first part of his baccalauréat, then entered the Foreign Legion at the beginning of World War II.

3. He was identified on 8 July 1950 as a participant in an armed bank robbery committed on 26 June 1949 in Paris. He was hunted throughout France; particularly in the area around Gap where his brother lives; and was finally arrested in Cergère on 11 July 1950, after abandonning an automobile that he had stolen at Sens (Yonne), while attempting to enter Spain illegally by way of the Pyrenees. 55,000 francs were found on his person, he confessed to the crime and told where he had hidden 520,000 francs (the remainder of his share of the hold-up). On 5 January 1953 he was condemned by the Cour d'Assises de la Seine to seven years of hard labor for the premeditated theft of 1,969,000 francs. Taking into consideration the time he served while waiting to be tried and his good behavior, he was released on 19 December 1955.

4. The measure to deport TZITZICHVILI because of arrest, passed on 12 February 1954, was modified on 14 February 1956 to limit him to residence in the Hautes Alpes department, where his brother Achille PALASKIET (formerly TZITZICHTLI) now lives.

5. TZITZICHILI had planned on immigrating to Peru upon his release from prison, but he was refused an entrance visa to that country. He had an Italian friend in Liza named LAFRANCO RANGONI, who lives at Avenue Taena, Bureau 92 and is an official of the Peruvian Chemical Industry.

6. TZITZICHVILI had a rather storry youth. He arrived in France in 1921 with his parents. In October 1936 he was condemned to imprisonment until the age of adulthood by the Tribunal pour Enfants de la Seine for theft. However, after a few weeks he was placed in his mother's custody. After that he fought in the War until 12 October 1950 when he was discharged. In 1943 he went to Germany as a voluntary worker and returned to France in June 1950.

7. Upon his arrest in July 1950, he was not only charged with armed robbery, for which he was sentenced, but also for four thefts accompanied by violence and an attempted theft, all committed between 1949 and June 1950.

SUBJECT: General - Operational/RHTWOOD/REDSOX/APACHE
Specific - REDSOX Candidate in France

Reference: OPFW 20952, dated 23 May 1958 201-207/37

Action requested: Please advise if it is desired
that we contact and assess Subject

1. Subject of this dispatch is the person thought to have genuine REDSOX potential mentioned in the first paragraph of reference.

2. Subject was described to us by AEPADDLE before the latter contacted him in France and from the report submitted under reference, it would appear to us that he may be even better than first was thought. We have noted the pros and cons as outlined in reference and would like the opportunity to comment on the latter. It would seem to us that the fact that Subject is on parole ought to make little difference, as far as his candidacy for REDSOX is concerned. Surely a means can be devised to remove him from France so that he will neither be hunted by the French authorities nor become the object of suspicion simply because he has left. He might emigrate to South America, which we probably could help him achieve. He could move to North Africa and disappear from there. If the fact that Subject is on parole is thought to be a handicap because it reflects on his character, we believe that what we wrote about the criminal record of AEDASIS 2 applies equally to this case. The matter of relatives in Georgia being considered as a con is difficult for us to understand, but we assure there must be some special circumstances which make it so. Generally speaking, we should have thought this to be a positive factor. Regarding possible surveillance by the other emigres we submit that such must be assumed in every case, notwithstanding what the Subject in question may think. The presumed surveillance becomes a problem when it is time to remove a candidate for training, which calls for a smooth cover for his disappearance (Cf. EGPA 21407). After all, emigre surveillance can only do so much; it cannot keep close tabs on an individual hourly. About the last point: Unless there are some special reasons not explained in reference why contacting Subject is difficult, we believe that we could do this securely and without attracting attention. The means of authenticating the approach outlined in reference should te ample assuming that AEPADDLE's arrangements are firm.

3. Unless the Paris Station is in a position to make the contact wich Subject, we request permission to do so. If granted, we would visit Gap, contact Subject by means of a photograph which, it would seem, could be supplied by Headquarters. It should be an uncomplicated matter to establish our bona fides. We should then try to arrange for Subject to

visit Gormany (possibly black, if necessary) for full debriefing and assessment It would seem to us that if we can arrange a visit to Geramy, the future problems which would ar ce casering his secure rezoval to MENCRE for training can be worked out. Cur contact in Gap with Subject would be coordinated with the Paris Station in detall.

4. If the above suggestion is approved, a reply in the near future e requested so that we shall be able to arrange our schedule accordingly

REDWOOD REDSCH AEACRE
AEPADDLE Debriefing

ACTION REQUIRED:

Attached for the information of Paris and Frankfurt is a copy of the debriefing of AEPADDLE. The Paris Station has already received some of this information directly from AEPADDLE, but there was probably not enough time for him to pass all of it to Platipodis during their meetings. There are a number of items that the field stations may find of use, but only one person named appears to have any genuine RFDS-IX potential. This is David TSITSICIVILI (Cf. IV of Attachment No. 2).

Pros Cons

1. No wife or children 1. On parole
2. Not living in large Georgian colony 2. Relatives in Georgia
3. No occupation 3. Possible emigre surveillance
4. Daring, initiative 4. Difficult to approach without attracting attention

Request Paris comments on feasibility of further efforts--possibility of finding out more about crimes for which Subject and ADAM were sentenced; also about nature of parole and possibility of having it lifted.

# AEPADDLE DEBRIEFING

3 and 4 April 1958

1. Previous Opa of British and Georgian En igres

A. Georgians involvei

1. Noe JORDANIA, late President of Georgian Republic in 1920's.

2. Revas CASACHVILI, ca. 75 yrs. old. Lives with wife at 133 r. l'Abbe Groult, Paris XV, no phone. Gets Social Security and aid from Georgians.

3. Eliase PATARIDZE, ca. 55-60 yrs. old. President of Georgian Association in Paris and of Georgian National Democrats. Lives with wife and children at 35 r. du Con. Erlanger, Auteuil 6584. Has grocery store at 84 r. Michelange. Three children: one 20 yrs. old and twins (boy and girl) 14.

4. Levan ZURABICHVILI was possibly involved. AEPADDLE surmised this, although L. Z. did not so state. Ca. 51 yrs. old. Married, boy 7, girl 5. Budget director for SIMCA automobile plant. Lives at 2 r. Jacques Mawas, Phone Licourbe 0212. Graduate of Ecole des Mines. Father of L.Z. was friend of PATARIDZE and CABACHVILI (National Democrats). L.Z. considers self a National Democrat, but felt need for broader organisation to embrace all non-Socialist Georgians. He has established such an organisation, possibly known as the Comite des Georgiens Libres.

(all the above four have lived in Paris since the 1920's)

5. Fna SOUMEA TACHVILI (SOUMBATOFF) was the Georgian contact man with the British.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

GABACHVILI and PATARIDZE were in touch with the Chief of British Intelligence" in 1950-53. GABACHVILI stated that he felt the British worked closely with the Americans, and that the chief intended to bring him to the US. CABACHVILI and PATARIDZE did not know why the British dropped the work, but CABACHVILI felt that after 1953 the British had turned the Near East over to the US. CABACHVILI as not been in touch with the Americans

B. Agents used by the British

1.  Mamia BERESHVILI

Lives in Leuville near Paris. Age ca. 36-40. Employed as a chemist and earns ca. 60.000 - 60,000 france per month. Hgt. ca. 5'8", wat, ca. 175 lbs., dark curly hair, dark round face, presently wears goatee and moustache. AEPADDLE knew BERESHVILI before. All BERESHVILI's family were killed or deported. He is anti-Russian and anti-Communist. He was very close to Nee JORDANIA. He has some writing ability, and had an article published last month in a journal of the anti-Russian group of the Georgiane (possibly known as Notre Patrie) which is published by Micha STOUROUA (STURWA). BERESHVILI belongs to this group and writes for newspapers. He went two or three times to Georgia on illegal missions. The last time he was wounded in the lower right leg, and was helped by a companion. He did not service the customary dead drop the last time because of his leg. The method of crossing involved use of uniforms of Turkish army officers, and the assistance of another Georgian and two Turks. At night they changed to civilian clothes and crossed over. BERESHVILl says there are organised Georgian groups willing to fight the Russians.

Since 1953 BERESHVILI has been contacted two or three times by the Americans, but nothing has come of this, and he feals the Americans are not following up properly. He said the latest attempt involved a letter written to him in Russian, giving him a telephone number to call. Before calling it he tried to trace the number through connections of his wife's. He feels that contact with Georgia is important if the emigration organizations are to be representative of the feelinge in the homeland.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

# 14-00000

Beginning in 1945 BERESHVILI was in the French Army for two or three years. This was to avoid being sent back to the USSR. In 1950 he had a grocery store: ALPADDLE feels that BERESHVILI would be willing to go again. ALPADOLE asked BERESHVILI about the conflict of interest between the emigres and the sponsoring country. BERESHVILI said he feels it is possible to satisfy both interests.

Note: Georgian Soviet ballet troupe which visited Parts in January-February 1958 know of BERESHVILI's missions to Georgia.

## 2. Fna DJAPADZE (CHAPADZE)

Now lives in London. Born 1912. Married, has children. Was in close contact with CABACHVILI and PATARIDZE, went to Georgia in 1951 and 1952. AEPADDLE gathered that DJAPADZE was the partner of BERESHVILI. BERLSHVILI said that a clash occurred on the last trip involving politics. He did not mention DJAPADZE, but since they are of different partios, ASPADDLE has connected them. (It is not clear whether this clash occurred on the trip when BERESHVILI was wounded.)

While in London, and later in Paris, AEPADDLE met Irakli MENTETACHVILI, 2) Alexandria Rd., nimbledon, London SW 19. MENTETACHVILI stated that he has contact in London with the police or intelligence service, and offered to be of service to AEPADDLE. AEPADDLE asked MENTETACHVILI about DJAPADNE. MENTETACHVILI had nothing good to say about him. Considered him a big bluff, who was not properly handled by the Eritish. MENTETACHVILI said the 1953 work was not continued because of the poor quality of DJAPADZE, MENTETACHVILI said that DJAPADZE never actually crossed the border. ALPADOLE discounts come of this, saying that MENTETACHVILI is a very bitter man. CABACHVILI and PATARIOZE said that they have a good, courageous man for entry into Georgia, whou: ALFADDLE assure to be DJALAUZL. They said this man is in London working for Eritish Intelligence.

## 3. Bagrat TOJADIACHVILI (CHADJASHVILI)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 134

went into an SS group (in the same group were David KVARIANI and the KALATOZI brothers, Shota and Irakli). The assignment of the group was to serve as security police after the Germans should take Georgia. After the war DJADIAHVILI ended in Valentignay where he works in a small shop. (Note: There is a fairly large Georgian colony in this small town. Most of them work at the Peugeot automobile plant.) He is emotional, gets drunk easily, and beats his wife. In the summer of 1951 and 1952 he went to England for training, but was never sent because he disagreed with the purposes of the mission. The British were interested in military matters, while he was more interested in political conditions. TEJADIACHVILI was working with the same group as BERESHVILI. TOJALACHVILI is 5'6", 165 lbs., very excitable after a few drinks. Very nationalistic, can't stand Georgian socialists. He did not mention any associates in England. He considered all his assignments to be of a petty nature. ALPADDLE feels that he is interested to work, however he lives in a small town where everyone knows about his previous training.

II. Other persons of possible interest

1. Toutount AKHMEDIANI

Lives at 31 r. Villedieu, Valentignay (Doubs). Stated that quite a few Georgians in Valentignay have worked for or are under the influence of the Soviets. Several are planning to go back. AKHMEDIANI is excitable, over 50, has rheumatism and eye trouble. Feels that action is necessary and has the desire, but knows his limitations. Fought with the Germans against the Soviets.

2. Shota STOUROUA (STURWA)

Lives in Paris area, not married. Anit-Soviet, but ACPADDLE had no chance to find out how far. Age 36 or 37, physically strong, has desire to work.

### III. Miscellaneous

1. The following is given as evidence of Soviet activity among Georgians in Frances

a. The following have received telephone calls from Tiflis:

Leo SARDJVELADZE, from his daughter two phone calls on family matters. The daughter married a WWII escapee who came out in 1943 or 1944 and went back in 1946 or 1947.

Shota KALA SOZI, from his mother. He also received several letters in which she said that everything is fine la Georgia but that Shota is old enough to wake up his own mind about repatriation.

Thomo TAKTAKICHVILI, from his mother who said she may visit him in Paris.

b. The following have received packages from Tiflis containing food and home made candy:

Theme ΓΑKTAKICHVILI

Mrs. Ketho TCHENKELI (CHENKELI)

Georgi CHANCHIACHVILI (SHANSHIASHVILI)

c. Nearly everyone received the Georgian language paper of the Mikhailov Committee in Berlin.

2. CABACHVILI, PATARIDZE and ZURABICHVILI all expressed Interest in American support for their group. They stated that the support given to their group as a whole by Polish intelligence before WW II largely contributed toward the readiness of large numbers of Caucasians to fight against the USSR during the war. PATARIDZE said he would like to be sent to Turkey to organize contacts with Georgia. Says he can get necessary papers for trip to Turkey, and has man in mind for such mission (apparently DJAPADZE). PATARIDZE says this operation would cost no more than one million French france.

3. At a convention of National Democrats in Paris, AEPADDLE met A. MIPIANI from London. KIPIANI is a former colonel of the Polish Army and works closely with General ANDERS. MIPIANI suggested working through American intelligence, and will send AEPADDLE a letter for making contact with the Anders group in the US.

4. AEPADDLE carried money (apparently from NY Georgians) to Paris to assist the publication and distribution of an emigre paper.

5. Both the Socialists and National Democrats would like to organise a group for common action. One drawback is that the Socialists apparently want to play down anti-communism (as opposed to Georgian separatism) and also want to have nothing to do with the American Committee in Munich. Noe TSINSADZE, the principal collaborator with the American Committee refused to break the connection or to drop the anti-communist line.

6. There are no really young Georgian-born people in Paris, but there are about 50 or 60 second generation Georgians, who speak French among themselves, but have some interest in Georgian affairs. The visit of the Georgian ballet stimulated this interest, and some of these youngsters are eager to visit Georgia.

7. The Germans are trying to set up an information link with the Caucasus. Concerned with this activity are Micha ALCHIBAYA and fou MANDE, the German officer in charge who was interested in the Caucasus during WW II. So far nothing concrete has been accomplished. AEPADDLE received this information from PATARIDZE, who has been to Munich in connection with this activity.

# David TSITSICHVILI (nickname Dathouna)

Subject is a childhood friend of AEPADDLE, Age - 39 years, height: 5'10", weight: 160 lbs., bald, has moustache. Subject is included in movies taken by AEPADDLE. Subject arrived in France with family from Georgia ca. 1923, and lived In Paris. How was a poor scholar and did not get any kind of diploma from school. He served as a private in the French Army from 1939 to 1940 or 1941 when he was discharged. I 1942 or 1943 he volunteered for work in Germany with the Todt Organization as a truck dirver, but changed to some other kind of work alter reaching Germany. While in Cermany he assisted French officer POW's to escape, aiding them with false papers, stamps and uniforme. He was able to travel from Berlin to Paris, and AEPADDLE saw him to Paris on one occasion during the war.

In 1944 a woman got in touch with him about helping an alleged French officer, and at the railroad station where he was to meet her, he was arrested by the SS (sic). In early 1945 he was sentenced to death for espionage, but managed to drag out his case by Implying the existence of a large British-run net of which he was a part. In 1945 he was liberated by the US Army and returned to Paris in the summer of that year. He was unable to find a suitable job, and between 1945 and 1948 he did odd jobs as a draftsman, and tried to market an invention of his own. (some kind of engine). He married a French girl about 1946 or 1947, and had two children. In 1948 he began to rob banka, Jewellery shops, etc., with a companion, Jean ADAM, a Frenchman who had worked with him during the war assisting French officers. ADAM was caught, and Subject attempted to escape to Spain but was also caught. Because of their war record they were given a "light" sentence ten years. Subject was released about one or two years ago, and is required to live in the small town of Cap (Hautes Alpes), under parole to his brother. ADAM has also been released, and is not under restriction as to residence. Subject feels this is unjust discrimination against himself as a non-citizen.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

Subject is bored by the quiet life in Gap. His wife and children are not with him, and he has not been able to make contact with them. ALPADDLE said his wife inay have divorced him. Subject is now trying to set up an advertising agency, and is also working on inventions and patents. Subject told AEPADDLE that he would like to work for American intelligence, and that he had unsuccessfully tried to reach US Naval Intelligence in 1957 through the American Embassy in Paris. AL PADDLE said that Subject has always been interested in this kind of work, and that ho has imagination and initiative, and likes action. AEPADDLE feels that Subject'a motivation is that he wants to live down his prison sentence and redeem himself as a man. He wants to acquire citizenship where he can feel he belongs (preferably US citizenship). Money is secondary with him. AEPADDLE says that Subject needs to have strict instructions and guidance la order not to go overboard and exceed the proper limits.

AEPADDLE requested and received from Sabject two copies of subject's name written backward. AEPADDLE explained that this would serve as bona fides for anyone who might want to contact Subject in the future.

Subject knows Georgian (AE PADDLE is not sure that he reads or writes welij, French, German and a little English. AEPADDLE described him as sensitive, and wanting respect. Subject has no present contact with his family in the USSR. Subject has written a detective novel, but it has not been published. He has also invented a calendar that shows the day of the week for any given date (a slide rule type gadget).

Subject's family
Father: Simon Mother: Marie (deceased)
Sister: Helene Brother: Artchil

Subject is now living with his brother Artchil, who is about 41 years old. The address is 1 bia r. de Bellvue, Cap (Hautes Alpes), Phone 1082. Artchil was recently divorced from the daughter of Noe Jordania (late President of Georgian Republic in early 1920's). His two daughters live with him. His former


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 143

wife also lives in Gap. They are the only Georgians living
there. Artchil was in the French Army until 1943 and is a
French citizen. He is a graduate in architecture from the Ecole
des Beaux Arts, and is a successful architect in Gap. He is
presently in charge of reconstruction of a whole village which
had to move because of a new dam. Ho has changed his name to
Artchil de PANASKET (name of a village in Georgia formerly
owned by the family). Artchil is financially well-off and is helping
other Georgians, including Mathe KERESELIDZE, who has
recently returned from Siberia.

In 1943 Subject's father, mother and sister left Paris
for Germany, where the daughter worked in an office, and where
the father hoped to sell same inventions to the Germans. At that
time Helene (who is now about 42 years old) married Irakli
LORTKIPANIDZE in Paris. They returned to Paris in 1946 or
1947. The Soviet Embassy was encouraging repatriation, and
the father and daughter decided to go back. The mother objected
and was supported by her two sons. She finally committed suicide
in protest, but they went anyway (father, daughter, her husband
and child). The daughter is now teaching French in Tiflis. The
father recently had a letter published in the Berlin Georgian
newspaper (apparently the Georgian paper of the Mikhailov
Committee) urging Georgian emigres to repatriate. AEPADDLE
heard that shortly after their return both father and daughter were
sent to Siberia for a time.

NOTE: ΑΕPADDLE went to Gap with his wife on his way to
Florence. Also there at that time was Levan ZURABICHVILI
who happened to be vacationing.

COMMENTS RE DEROGATORY TRACES
ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

1. A POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his use as a penetration of Venezuelan General Directorate of Police. Cancellation was roquested in February 1968 because of indications that Subject was involved in "clandestine sabotage activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activities to CIA. Thereafter, Subject was treated as a "hostile". In the ensuing months Subjoct was describod as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of his important and accurate intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was given a polygraph examination to clear up questions about possible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-. tion with gangster elements, etc. His responses showed no information which would provent CIA using him for ops purposes. Request for POA was again roquested on 7 September 1968. This POA request was turned down on 15 October due to Subject being an "agent of a foreign power."

2. Since that time Subject has continued to provide verbal and written information reports concerning Communist and subversive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviot activities, sabotage, etc. Subject continues to report accurately and often and has a very pro-U.S. attitudo. Subject was again polygraphed on 29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's CI/OA folder). His responses indicated no deception concerning truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his U.S. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms dealings, etc.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Training
Attention: Chief, Covert Training OS/TR

SUBJECT : Covert Training Requirement for Station
Caracas, Project CIFLUTE

REFERENCE : CSI No. 25-5

1. With regard to previous discussions between WH/3/
   Venezuela and Chief, Covert Training Branch, it is hereby
   requosted that two instructors be assigned on TDY status to
   Station Caracas for the purpose of conducting operational train-
   ing for selected members of the Directorate General of Police
   (DIGEPOL) and the Central Documentation Service (SDC). Names
   of the training candidates are included on a separate sheet
   attached to this memorandum.

2. This training program has been initiated at the direct
   request of senior Venezuelan liaison officers associated with
   Station Caracas. A general description of the situation, sub-
   ject matter and identification of possible problem areas has
   boon forwarded to you in the form of HVCA-16550, 9 May 1969.

3. Project CIFLUTE, under which this training will be
   conducted, was approved on 8 March 1963 and covers all liaison
   conducted by Station Caracas with the Venezuelan security
   services.

4. In this training program, we hope to attain several
   objectives. First, through training selected members of
   DIGEPOL and SDC we wish to present sourd operational methods
   and techniques which will impress the trainees and serve as a
   guide to them in improving their operations. Secondly, it is
   desired to improve Station Caracas' liaison relationship with
   these services by presenting a highly professional training
   program. Third, we hope that through this good will, the Station
   will be able to develop potential unilateral agent recruits
   who will become perietrations of the Venezuclan services.

5. All of the trainee candidates (sce attached list) are
   members of DIGEPOL and SDC. The first four individuals listed
   have extensive intelligence backgroursis and are experienced


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

operations personnel. The remaining six trainees may be ansumed to have moderate experience - more in the field of law enforcement and police investigations rather than intelligence operations. 201 files are available at the desk on each individual and we will make these filos available to the instructors to give them an idea of each individuals background.

6. Trainees will be available on a full time basis. A secure building has been obtained by the liaison services for exclusive use by instructors during the training cycle. Training will have to be conducted in Spanish.

7. Although evaluations on all trainees are desired, the last six individuals listed will require more attention since our relationship with these men is new and less is known about them. Station Caracas will provide guidance in this area. An additional point of interest would be any individual among this group who might have potential as an instructor.

8. Follow-up training and/or technical training will be based on instructor and Station recommendations. At this time we have no information on what, if any, technical skills the trainees have.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/ΟΑ

SUBJECT : AMCLEVE-15 (201-300985)

1. Subject, a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela, is a Station Caracas penetration of the Venezuelan General Directorate of Police and of the Special Group, a smaller, somewhat autonomous unit within DIGEPOL. A POA was requested on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above. On 1 February 1967, WH/3/V requested cancellation of the POA request because of indications that Subject was involved in clandestine sabotage activity and there were suspicions that he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIGEPOL. Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile". The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with Subject as a source of information on activities of DIGEPOL and the Special Group but that no requirements were to be levied on him. The Station was advised that they could make spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.

2. The Station acknowledged their instructions but demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of ANCLEVE-15's activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete control and who seldom disclose the complete range of their activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they were interested in Subject because of his position as a "trusted confidant" of certain highly placed Venezuelan security officials.

3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the intelligence information and operational reports he furnished. For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

as part of an infiltration scheme. He has reported such operational information as a description of the capabilities, layout and equipment of DICEPOL telephone tap operations. Included in this information was his report that, at least on paper, the U.S. Embassy was a target for tap operations. He has also reported on the personalities and workings of the organizations with which he is associated. At the same time the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved in a scheme to obtain "curare poison for approximately forty hypodermic necdles". To avoid exposing the source of their information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involvement in wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restrictions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this involvement with him.

4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and, further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of engaging in independent Cuban exile activity without informing - his Case Officer. The Station also requested a polygraph examination for Subject.

5. Subject was given a polygraph examination to resolve specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban Intelligence through relatives, unreported association with gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM and other questions involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject'a responses, described as substantially truthful by the examiners, appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA'S operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv- ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer, Lefty Rosenthal, did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, "... In fairness to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un- certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile arms supplies, "

6. Station Caracas has requested that they be allowed to cease treating AMCLEVE-15 as a "hostile" and that he be pro- cessed for POA/OA to permit more effective utilization of this well. placed penetration agent. WIH Division endorses the Station's request.

25 January 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/OA

SUBJECT : Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles 201-300985

1. It is requested that a Provisional Operation Approval be granted for the use of subject as a penetration agent into DIGEPOL and the Remberto UZCATEGUI Bruzual organization. The Caracas Station has requested that processing be expedited.

2. The Caracas Station has reviewed Subject's file and the documents sent by Headquarters and sees nothing that would preclude the use of Subject as a penetration of DIGEPOL. (copy attached)

3. Significant information in Subject's file concerns his two brothers who are currently in Cuba and his relations with a well known Miami gangster. One brother, Roberto POSADA Carriles, a suspect DSE official, is the Cuban Telephone Company supervisor for Area Norte, including Havana City. Subject has not seen either brother since he left Cuba in 1961. Subject has also been in contact with a well known gangster "Lefty" Rosenthal in the Miami area. Both JMWAVE and the FBI were aware of this contact which was maintained at the latter's request.

3. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR STATION TO WORK WITH FERNANDEZ IF HE APPOINTED CHIEF, DIGEPOL BUT FEEL THAT SENSITIVE OPS SHOULD CONTINUE BE HANDLED WITH CIWOODS OR UNILATERALLY. IT IS TRUE THAT FERNANDEZ COOPERATED WITH STATION DURING HIS PREVIOUS TOUR AND APPEARED NOT BE ANTI-WOFACT BUT HIS GENERAL GREEDINESS AND LACK OF SCRUPLES MAKE HIM AN UNSAVORY PARTHER TO DEAL WITH AT THAT LEVEL.

4. IF STATION DOES NOT HAVE ABOVE DOCUMENTATION HOS WILL FORWARD. WILL DISCUSS FERNANDEZ WITH COS ON HIS ARRIVAL HOS.

END OF MESSAGE

WH COMMENT: *COS, Minit and Erasto Fernandez Betancourt, for DC/Digepol met to discuss colaboration between Station and Digepol.* Not clear if Fernandez to be new Chief. While F has bad rep not clear why. Fernandez was cooperative with Station previous time no clear indications he enriched himself by accepting bribes from left. Station would work slowly until full assessment acquired. Asked WAVE to work closely with AMCLEVE-15 during Fernendez stay in Miami to collect info on latter.

WH COMMENT: *Suggests/JMWAVE have AMCLEVE-15 telephone/Erasto Fernandez Setancourt, who has been nominated as new head of DIGEPOL, to attempt to firm up previous job offer by Fernandez. AMCLEVE-15 should delay actual departure for Caracas until his position is clarified. Request Hqs concurrence.

**Hqs believes that, in view unsettled DIGEPOL situation and vague and unsubstantiated nature AMCLEVE-15 job possibilities, not advisable make financial commitment to him to enable him to return to Venezuela. If he returns on his own and Caracas determines he has operational potential, possibility of WOFACT employment can be reconsidered.

1. Forwarded under separate cover is the up-dated Target Study on Jesus CRUZ Gonzalez, the Cuban Press Attache in Mexico, and his wife, Mercedes MARTINEZ Moreno, Secretary to the Ambassador and Charg√©. As is clear from the attached study and the log of activities of CRUZ during October 1970, CRUZ is extremely busy, has many contacts, and is probably one of the more accessible members of the Cuban Embassy. On the other hand, he is so busy with his overt activities working with press matters, and handling the Cuban Embassy side of Prensa Latina, that the Station does not believe he has practically any time free for intelligence assignments. (Since the arrival of the Cultural Attache in January 1970, CRUZ has dropped all cultural activities. He no longer handles the Mexican-Cuban Cultural Institute.) He is on the phone with or visiting the Prensa Latina offices several times each day. He arranges for subscriptions to publications (magazines and newspapers) through Prensa Latina from the United States and Latin American countries and he orders books from various bookstores in Mexico City. He also handles the press material, including news film, coming to Mexico via commercial flights from the Prensa Latina representative in Peru. He orders photographic and other related supplies in Mexico and New York, and handles visas for newsmen who wish to travel to Cuba. Mercedes does lot to help CRUZ, as he does not have his own secretary. As can be seen from the attached log, twice he dictated a cable over the phone for her to type for his signature. It is believed that when she returns in the afternoon to the Embassy with CRUZ it is to help him.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

## SECRET

2.  The LIEMBRACES have surveilled CRUZ quite often, and only one unusual contact was noted. That was a three hour luncheon with an Argentine leftist, *Maximo SIMPSON Grinberg*, a foreign correspondent in Mexico for the magazine *Medico Moderno*. Generally speaking, CRUZ leaves the Embassy during the working day alone on his errands, rather than with another Embassy employee, which is more often the rule with the other officers. CRUZ usually goes with his wife on errands during the lunch hour or in the afternoon before returning to the Embassy. These errands are on personal business such as to the furniture store, super market, optics, doctor, etc; but also on business, such as to bookstores. CRUZ' days are very long, as can be seen from the attached log.

3. While Mercedes and CRUZ are very busy and have many contacts, they do not seem to make close personal friends, and the persons with whom they are in contact appear almost exclusively to be business contacts. The Station has been unable to locate any person who might make a good access agent to CRUZ. None of the Station's agents mentioned in paragraph 6 of HMMA-38920 were close to CRUZ. The closest companion would be the Subject of 201-860095. The Station is reporting separately on its attempts to develop and recruit this person.

4.  The Station has even considered approaching CRUZ' maid, especially when it became known she was so unhappy with her lot as a servant. However, since the maid almost never leaves the apartment and she is virtually inaccessible, the Station has been unsuccessful in having any asset establish any degree of rapport with her, although a contact of LITAINT-2 has been able to engage her in telephone contact and hopes to date her eventually.

5. Since the Station believes that CRUZ is almost entirely dedicated to press affairs, and no really good access agents are in view, the Station will not make a priority effort to develop an entre into CRUZ' circle except via the operation now underway to recruit 201-860095. If this operation is successful, the Station would have an excellent asset in frequent contact with CRUZ for a better personal assessment and information on CRUZ' assignment in Mexico for the Cubans. Until this type of information becomes available, however, the Station believes it has identified CRUZ' role as almost purely press, and we have been unable to detect any vulnerability data on either CRUZ or his wife.

Mercedes said in 1968 that her Mother and Father were the only family she had in Cuba. (Note: It was impossible to interpret whether she meant part of her family was outside Cuba, or this was all there was to the family.)

LISAMPAN/BAKER: reported in 1968 that Mercedes said she had sent her nephew "Robertico" a pair of stockings.

12. Religion:

UFAA 603, Source Jesus' sister, said that Cruz' family is large and all are devout Catholics. Nine members are priests or nuns. Until 1956 Jesus CRUZ was a student at La Salle Seminary. An aunt on the father's side was the Mother Superior of a convent in Cuba, and is now in a convent in Spain.

Mercedes: No indication Mercedes is Catholic nor agnostic. In March 1968 she said she didn't think the Soviets should have held a reception of the Soviet poet Yevshenko in view of the death of the Soviet astronaut GAGARIN a few days before.

13. Education:

Jesus: UFAA 603. Was a student at La Salle Seminary in Havana from 1946 to 1956 studying to be priest. Left in 1956 to attend high school. He was graduated in 1957.

Mercedes: Said she did not study either at secundaria or preparatoria. (This means no high school education.). Instead she said she studied some commercial courses. (Note: She is a good secretary, and takes shorthand and types. Source: LISAMPAN/BAKER.)

14. Languages:

Jesus: speaks some French (was stationed in Paris)

Mercedes: speaks some French and some English. She thinks the English has been useful, but Jesus apparently refuses to learn English and has chided Mercedes about her having studied it. Mercedes is proud of her French and likes to correct people's pronunciation of French words. She says that when she speaks a lot of English it is hard for her to express herself in French. She has no trouble translating either French or English. She studied English for 5 years. (LISAMPAN/BAKER) (Source: Sation appraisal of Mercedes' English is that it is only fair.)

15. Military service:

Not known.

16. History of employment:

a) Jesus:

1958 or 59: Western Union in Havana. (This is where Jesus met Mercedes who was also working for Western Union.)

Nov. 1961 - Sept 1964: Jesus was Press Attach√© in Paris. (Mercedes worked in Paris as personal secretary to Amb. CARRILLO. The Cuban Diplomatic and Consular Missions Abroad listed Mercedes as an Attach√© in Paris in January 1963. It was also reported she was Foreign Service II Assistant which is an Attach√©.)

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

SECRET

HMMA 36071 reported Mercedes said she was in Paris only during 1962 and 1963, but Jesus remained until 1964.

LISAMPAN/BAKER reported on 21 August 1968 that Mercedes said she was separated from Jesus for 9 months while he was in Europe, serving in Prague.

LISAMPAN/BAKER, 1968, Mercedes said that Mexico was colder than Paris, and later Prague. Said she arrived in Prague in full winter.

1965-1967: Jesus was in Cuba working for the Foreign Ministry (Source: Digna, the sister. Digna, however, was wrong about the dates of Jesus' assignment in Paris which she gave as late 1962 to late 1965) (Note: Possibly he was in Prague 1964-65.)

Mercedes may have worked in the Cuban Foreign Ministry during the same period. ŒóŒúŒúŒë 35071 reported she worked in the "Direccion" with a girl who was going to marry Pedro LLOPIS Salles, a courier.

LISAMPAN/BAKER reported on 8 August 1968 that Mercedes made reference to the fact she worked in the "Ministry".

LISAMPAN/BAKER reported in November 1968 that Mercedes gave instructions on typing of "Confidential" correspondence. She said one copy goes to Raul ROA (Foreign Minister). She said, "Don't forget, I worked within the Secretary". ŒóŒúŒúŒë 36071.

20 November 1967 CRUZ arrived PCS in Mexico as Press and Cultural Attach√© (Second Secretary). Mercedes became the private secretary for the Ambassador. (Note: She is one of two secretaries who are paid in the Embassy.)

17. Record of arrests:

Not known.

B. Curriculum Vitae (Chronologically by year from birth to present.)

Jesus' youth was that of a normal middle class Cuban. The father had a small farm and from the profits gave his family a comfortable life. They were not, however, rich or from the upper crust of the social ladder. Jesus' sister said "we had everything we needed. We were middle class Cubans, not rich, but not poor." Jesus was a student during the Batista era before Castro. He did not have to work; he just asked father for his expense money. Sister thinks Mercedes was from a middle class family. (UFAA 2430, 22 October 1970)

Apparently in Havana, then Paris, Havana, Mexico City. See Job history. Some question whether they went to Prague, when, why, and for how long, possibly this was after Paris.

C. Personal and Private Data

1. Address and telephone number of present residence:

Amsterdam 218, Apt. 201
Mexico City, Mexico (DOI: November 1970)
Phone: 574-0224

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

2. Nature and description of lodging and surroundings:

a) previous apartment in Mexico City was only one bedroom apartment. They lived there during their first tour until Mercedes went home to have her third baby. In January 1969 she said that when she returned from Cuba she would seek new quarters. Her apartment was uncomfortable and she couldn't receive people there, they always had to eat out. Mercedes indicated to a Embassy officer she would not ask for authorization from Havana first as she might be turned down, then she would not be allowed to move.

She indicated she brought from Recuperaci√≥n de Bienes a dining room and living room furniture. She bought in Mexico her beds, and a refrigerator out of her own salary. She thought she fared worse than other employees.

b) In early 1970 they rented their present apartment, which has three bedrooms and two baths, plus a maid's bedroom and bath. Living room, kitchen, dining room.

3. Location of resident, with respect to target installation:

15 blocks almost directly East from the Embassy.

4. Servants:

Clara Santa, Cuban, negro. Has special Cuban passport and is in Mexico as part of Cruz' household. Born about 1936. Called a "technical export".

In 1968 the Felix LUNA (201-759016) family also had a Cuban maid which they brought with them when they came PCS. That maid is no longer here. She was also negro.

July 1968 Carlota, the other maid, said she saw the records, and they were to get 1,000 pesos salary. But deductions were to be made for food, etc. In mid-1968 both Carlota and Clara Santa each got 500 pesos (U.S. $40) per month. Mercedes always pays Clara

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

-10-

promptly, but she is a stingy mistress, and deducts
from Clara Santa's salary every cent paid for the
maid's medicines, etc.

It is known that the Cuban government gives some
money to Clara Santa's mother in Cuba. How much
is not known. Clara Santa wated to ask for a part
of her mother's money in Mexico to help buy shoes,
clothes, etc. to take back to Cuba, but she was told
this was a capitalistic approach.

Mercedes, though strict, is good about sending
packages of medicines back to Cuba for Clara.

Clara is apparently very color conscious. Always asks
what color a person is. She says the Mexicans like
Negro women, therefore she had to be careful. (Note:
It is possible Mercedes told her this to keep her home,
as this was insinuated once.) Mercedes does not like
for Clara Santa to talk with people on the phone. The
other maid, Carlota, commented Mercedes treated Clara
like a child.

Clara's main complaint is that she has no free time, is
tied to the apartment, does not have time for the movies,
to get her hair done, etc. She also complains things
are expensive in Mexico. Likes to buy clothes. Mercedes
does help her with the washing and ironing. Mercedes
also helps by sending a lot of the laundry out, especially
that which needs ironing, like shirts. Compared to the
Luna's, the Cruz' do very little entertaining, thus
lightening Clara's work.

22 September 1970: Daisy/called Santa re the farewell
party given for Mrs. Luna. Santa said that Mercedes
asked Santa if she wanted to go, but Santa felt she had
to tell Mercedes she was the one who should go. Daisy
and Santa criticize all the women who work at the
Embassy, saying they are a bunch of hypocrites. (Main
complaint seems to be the other women have money, buy
clothes, etc.) Santa said she would be glad when
December came as she can then return to Cuba (did not
say for vacation or PCS).

November 1970: Clara still seldom goes out. Her best friend appears to be Daisy ZULUETA, also a negro. Daisy does Clara's hair, sometimes shop together.

5. Meals, where, when and with whom:

Jesus and Mercedes both generally return to the Embassy after lunch. Lunch is often hurried at home. Comparatively speaking they have few luncheon guests. Apparently they often eat the evening meal out (in Mexico this is the light meal of the day).

For an evening snack they often go to "El Farolita" on the corner of Juanacatlan and Altata.

6. Barber:

Not known, but Cruz always appears neat.

Mercedes goes to the beauty shop quite often. She keeps her hair dyed--black.

7. Tailor:

Jesus: As of September 1968 Jesus had two suits. He apparently brought one with him from Cuba. He had one made in Mexico. Cost him over 1,000 pesos (U.S. $80)

When in Yucatan during 1968, both Cruz and Mercedes bought a lot of things (LIFEAT implied in the clothes line). When Cruz returned in July 1968 he bought a lot of Guayaberas (typical Yucatecan sport shirts).

14. Normal after hours activity:

Cruz almost always returns to the Embassy after a late lunch to work. He apparently works late at the Embassy. In the evening he also has appointments.

Mercedes returns to the Embassy also. She either helps Cruz, or sits in the gatehouse and gossips.

Cruz and Mercedes go to the movies a lot in the evening.

They both leave the Embassy together at 14:00 every day and then surveillance shows that Mercedes and Jesus generally run errands (grocery, dry cleaning, etc.) after work and before or after lunch. Therefore they take a long lunch break. Cruz also meets with Carlos FERREIRA of Prensa Latina in Ferreira's apartment or in Cruz'

There is little indication Cruz and his wife go to night clubs, cafes. On 15 August 1968 they did go to CARDINI's, but this probably because a Cuban singer was playing there.

17. Vacations:

Cruz and Mercedes do not appear to take vacations in Mexico nor to travel much in Mexico on weekends. Mercedes does, apparently, think it is important to see the tourist sights as has told this to visiting Cubans.

They also seldom go to Cuba. The whole family, including maid, returned to Cuba for one month home leave in January 1969, after having been in Mexico for 2 years. Mercedes had not returned to Cuba in this time, nor had the children.

20. Personal friends:

Cruz and his wife do not seem to have close personal friends. They seem to be colder, prefer to be alone, and spend most of their time working or running family errands. They do not even appear to develop close freindships with their fellow employees. Mercedes likes to gossip with the other employees, but her friendship appears to stop there. Most of their contacts appear to be in Cruz' line of work--press or cultural, and are for business purposes.

21. Persons who visit Subject at residence:

Other fellow employees. Carlos Ferreira of Prensa Latina.

22. Correspondents:

Paris: ŒóŒúŒúŒë 35050: Esther Maria OSSES of the University of Paris wanted to go to Cuba and asked Cruz to write her via the Cuban Press Attach√© in Paris She appeared to be a friend of Cruz from his days in Paris.

23. Telephone contacts:

Cruz receives and makes many long distance phone calls at his home. Calls came in from Havana, the Cuban Mission in New York, and from cultural/press contacts throughout Mexico. This was quite true during the pre-Olympic season when the Cubans had many cultural affairs (dance teams, art, etc.) circulating around Mexico. Now the calls mainly concern press matters. He calls the Cuban Missions in Canada and New York re purchases they are making for him. Also calls Havana and they call him at home.

Mercedes used to smoke "KOOL" cigarettes when she was in Paris.

As of November 1970 it does not appear either smoke now. (LITAINT-2)

Cruz has and has always had a QP car in Mexico.
While he shares this with other Embassy officers
occasionally, it is usually his.

Cruz usually picks Mercedes up at home if she has to
do something or go to the Embassy late. But she also
quite often calls a cab to take her someplace. Once
she commented she had taken a bus.

Mercedes took driving lessons in Mexico on May 1970,
and occasionally drives alone but not as much as the
other driving wives.

28. Chattel property:

Cubans provided Cruz with living and dining room
furniture, but in Mexico they bought their own beds,
and a refrigerator.

6. Basic duties:

Jesus Cruz:

a) In Paris, Jesus was head of the Press Department and was responsible for distribution of over-all work in the Embassy. Constantly tried to make high level French contacts, and was involved in France-Cuba association. Also handled liaison with Soviet Bloc establishments, particularly Russian and Czech Embassies.

d) In the cultural field his main responsibility was liaison with the Cultural Institutes throughout Mexico. He provided the institutes with propaganda material, film. He attended or saw that someone else attended major functions at the various institutes; arranges cultural events such as art exhibits, visiting Cuban musicians and artists, etc. During the pre-Olympic period in the summer and fall of 1968 this cultural responsibility was extremely time consuming as the Cubans were very active in this cultural exchange field.

f) In line with both the press and cultural jobs, Cruz was responsible for the handling of visas for persons connected in both the press and cultural fields. He, not the Consulate, would obtain the visas and was the Cuban contact. After January 1970, Cruz' responsibility is limited to the press field.

secretary to the Ambassador. Cruz also gives her a
lot of his work to do. Now (November 1970) she is

the pouch each Friday and Monday (the days of the Cubana
flights). LISAMPAN/BAKER (HMMA 36071). On 4 September
1968 she told the Austrian Embassy that she was in charge
of the diplomatic mail to Cuba. Apparently, however,
she doesn't always open or distribute the incoming pouch.
In November 1968 the Ambassador's chauffeur had opened
the pouch and Mercedes did not know what was in the pouch.

c) There is also an indication Mercedes is responsible
for all classified filing and material in the Embassy.
Before she arrived, each man handled and kept his won.
She now maintains the safes and gives instructions on
the handling of classified materials.

c) Rita BLAZEK, transcriber, commented that Mercedes is very correct with the Ambassador, yet is also friendly and relaxed with him.

10. Subordinates:

Jesus Cruz' principal subordinates are the Prensa Latina chief. He appears to rely more on his wife than he does his part-time secretary for business matters. The Station believes he can use Rosa FERNANDEZ de ALVAREZ, the secretary of Jorge HERNANDEZ, Cultural Attach√©.

With the Prensa Latina men, he gives quite specific instructions. He believes he should be consulted more by Prensa Latina, so that it can be sure to follow the line. He is on the phone constantly with Prensa Latina, going to their office or having Prensa Latina employees come to the Embassy.

Mercedes appears to get along well with all the employees in the Embassy, and is very friendly with official Cuban visitors. She especially likes to gossip. In this gossip she often criticizes the other compa√±eras in the Embassy.

When being introduced to a stranger, Cruz is very business-like.

LISAMPAN/BAKER: 12 November 1968: When Mercedes
was on the phone with the maid, Santa, the conversation
appeared to concern gossip over Jesus' family. Mercedes
indicated that "that will change the matter, Jesus said
yesterday, we are going to maintain our distance, she
is just bringing a story, and there are many in Cuba
living in this way." Later Mercedes said her in-laws
were in Cuba and a problem. Mercedes tells a fellow-
employee the problem she has had with Jesus' family.
They were very religious, and racists. When the
Revolution was a success, they wanted Jesus to obtain
jobs for all of them, and Jesus told them he hadn't
made the Revolution to get jobs for them. They had to
resolve their own problems. Her mother-in-law hadn't
wanted Jesus to marry Mercedes and did not attend the
wedding. Later Mercedes said, "it seems clear that
when she (probably the sister Digna) came it is because
the vieja (mother-in-law?) has asked for a visa.
(See HMMA 36071)

In view of UFAA 603, this conversation is probably
referring to the visit of Digna, Jesus' sister to Cuba
to see about visas for the family to get out of Cuba.
Per UFAA 603, Digna was in Mexico in November 1968 and
saw Cruz at the Embassy re visas. She begged him to
help her so that these relatives could leave Cuba, and
Cruz refused. He said he also wanted his parents with
him, but he could do nothing to help them. (Source:
sister, commented she believed Jesus probably did not
want his parents to leave Cuba as it might compromise
him or might affect his own (wife and children) family's
freedom to leave Cuba with him.)

UFAA 603: Sister believed Mercedes has great
influence on Jesus..

b. Miscellaneous:

Mercedes' personality:

April 1968: Mercedes complained that when she arrived
home in the eveing she had to wash diapers. Complained
about the soap in Mexico, and the high cost of living.
(LISAMPAN/BAKER).

June 1968: Clara (Cuban maid) said that they didn't iron the sheets here. Clara does not iron much, but Mercedes helps with the washing and ironing. They send most of the things to the laundry, especially the things that need ironing (like shirts).

Mercedes also helps Clara in the kitchen some.

Baker: August 1968: Mercedes says she worries, but knows it won't solve anything, so doesn't let herself suffer.

Mercedes' attitude toward Mexico:

1968: She believed that Cubans in Mexico had to be careful of themselves and their children as there was personal risk because they are Cubans.

She doesn't like Mexico because of the high robbery rate, the fact that children are "stolen" and disappear.

She complains about the poverty in Mexico, especially in the small pueblos, the fact the people go barefoot, beg, about the poverty in general.

Mercedes thinks that when one reaches 35 years old, you are on the downhill.

c. What are feelings about family when they are separated?

Mercedes claims to miss Cruz when he is away. She says she is lonely.

December 1968: When Jesus was in Guadalajara, apparently to a cultural event, he called Mercedes to see about the family, and to leave messages for the office. He told her he would call her every evening--collect.

7. Personal and professional goals:

a. What seems to be his general life goals?

Keep active physically and stay on in diplomatic work.

b. To what extent is he motivated by self interest? family interest? etc:

UFAA 603: Jesus' sister said Mercedes is the type of person who likes to live well without working. The sister commented she took a Cuban maid with her.

(Mexico City Station Comment: Since all the Cubans in Mexico have maids, but Mexican ones, to whom they pay about the same as Mercedes pays the Cuban, do not believe this indicates Mercedes is lazy. As a matter of fact, she pitches in more than most of the Cuban se√±oras.)

Sister said Cruz is capable of extensive personal sacrifice for a cause. She believes he is not primarily interested in salary and position, but he is an idealist.

c. What are his personal pursuits, sources of satisfaction, hobbies, avocations, etc:

Hunting, swimming, fishing, skin diving, jai alai tennis.

d. What are his pet peeves, complaints, grievances?

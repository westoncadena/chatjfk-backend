Deputy Director for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

Office of Security, Headquarters

Executive direction and supervision of all Office of Security activities in support of worldwide Agency. This additional responsibility encompassed the supervision and guidance to area Security Officers assigned to other Agency components throughout the world. This position required frequent, day or night visits.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 5

Mr. James P. O'Connell has responsibilities for providing executive direction and
guidance to a highly sensitive and complex area of Agency security. This involved
physical, technical and overseas security. Since August 1968, he served in
the positions of Chief, Security Policy and Executive Staff, Assistant Deputy
Director for Investigations and Operations Support and as Chief, Regional
Officer for the Far East. All of these positions required not only a broad
Agency and security activities but also exceptional executive ability, which
O'Connell's case has been consistently rated from "Strong" to "Outstanding."
Evidence of his many contributions and dedication to the Agency and Office
are the many kudos he has received to date. He received commendations in 1958,
1959, in 1961, 1965, 1969: letters of appreciation in 1969, 1971, and 1973.
and the sensitivity of many of these recognitions do not permit a full and com-
plete analysis. They are indicative of the caliber of professionalism and dedication
he has consistently displayed.

Furthermore, Mr. O'Connell has demonstrated, particularly after assum-
ing responsibilities in this Office, an unusual and selfless dedication and professional-
ism that has been a hallmark of his service to the Agency and the country. To
do so is difficult to emulate and is a direct credit to the Office and the Agency.

I want to express my appreciation to you personally and through you to Howard Osborn and the other of your associates who contributed so effectively to the visit of the President on Friday. The arrangements were flawless; the security first-class without being intrusive. I am well aware of the amount of work and planning which went into the successful outcome. I particularly want to commend the good sense and judgment which prevailed throughout. It is easy to push people around. It is difficult to take proper precautions and at the same time make everyone feel as though it were his or her party. Thank you very much. Well done!

MEMORANDUM FOR: 1. James P. O'Canell, Jr. 25 February 1966

THROUGH : Head of Career Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomination is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Roard. This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the system may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a participant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your record it. appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing: 15 years of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System it you should meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the matrials cited above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligible to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to discuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 68-1319 Headquarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questions you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Narrative Fitness Report
Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1-April 1971 to 31 March 1972. The rating period covers the third full year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security.

2. The directorate which Mr. O'Connell supervises is geographically widely separated in the Headquarters area. This separation adds complexities to the task of supervising the directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions, operating over a broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities. During the veperting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's directorate took or an important, added responsibility--the security of automatic data processing. This function covers the complexity of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with serious security problems because of the severe compaction of information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability of technology in the field of data handling. The achievements of the Physical Security Division, the Technical Division, and the Overseas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordination in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified security policy.

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieved effective supervision. The Divisions moved forward in an


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

innovative manner and have been effective in discharging their responsibilities.

4. Mr. O'Connell also spearheads the security progrem which furnishes Security Officers to overseas stations and domestic operations as necessary. Mr. O'Connell has taken a personal interest in this activity and has been of considerable assistance to the Office of Security Career Board in the assignment of Security careerists to those positions.

5. During the last Fitness Report, the description of Mr. O'Connell's performance was raised from "Strong" to "Outstanding." He has continued his performance in such a manner as to warrant an OUTSTANDING rating.

Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1. This is a narrative Fitness Report which covers the period from 1 April 1970 through 31 March 1971.

2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security. The rating period covers his second full year in that position. The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has gained added importance and increased attention during the year. It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole. Mr. O'Connell has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from domestic efforts resulting from national unrest. Mr. O'Connell has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his responsibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to simplify their solutions.

3. During the previous rating period, Mr. O'Connell's performance was considered to be STRONG with several outstanding features. During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient addition to the outstanding areas of his performance to raise his over-all rating to OUTSTANDING.

009784 SEC-SS

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1968-
   through 31 March 1969.

2. Mr. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security
   for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security in August 1968 and
   this Rating covers his performance during this period as well as
   his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to 1 August
1968. 
3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,
   Technical and Overseas Security, is responsible for the super.ision
   of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition,
   he is responsible for providing policy and technical guidance to
   our Area Security Officers assigned to other components of the
   Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1968,
   Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of
   these varied and complex activities. He is an alert and intelligent
   supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several siguifi-
   cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate
   which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall
   efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was
   instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division
   made necessary by the dissolution of this Office's regional security
   staff in Frankfurt, West Germany. He is an astute manager and an

effective supervisor. He brings to the performance of his duties broad knowledge and experience of security procedures and practices. He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary obligations within his Directorate.

4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to express himself well in both written and oral form. His career is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level performances. He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior Security executive. However, I feel that he has not as yet applied all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance as DD/PTOS. Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chief who is extraordinarily capable and effective in producing results. Conversely, however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. I am convinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and is working hard to achieve the proper supervisory balance. I rate his performance, on balance, as STRONG with many outstanding features. I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office and the Agency..

Chief, Executive Staff

1.  Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of this Office from 1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period covered by this Fitness Report.

2.  Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective in arranging priority action in meeting short deadlines. As the initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

3.  Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance. ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however, that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and initiative. Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1971 to 31 March 1972. The rating period covers the third full year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security.

2. The directorate which Mr. O'Connell supervises is geographically widely separated in the Headquarters area. This separation adds complexities to the task of supervising the directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions, operating over a broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities. During the reporting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's directorate took on an important, added responsibility--the security of automatic data processing. This function covers the complexity of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with serious security problems because of the severe compaction of information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability of technology in the field of data handling. The achievements of the Physical Security Division, the Technical Division, and the Overseas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordination in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified security policy.

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieved effective supervision. The Divisions moved forward in an

innovative manner and have been effective in discharging their
responsibilities.

4. Mr. O'Connell also spearheads the security program
   which furnishes Security Officers to overseas stations and domestic
   operations as necessary. Mr. O'Connell has taken a personal
   interest in this activity and has been of considerable assistance to
   the Office of Security Career Board in the assignment of Security
   careerists to those positions.

5. During the last Fitness Report, the description of Mr.
   O'Connell's performance was raised from "Strong" to "Outstanding."
   He has continued his performance in such a manner as to warrant
   an OUTSTANDING rating.

Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1. This is a narrative Fitness Report which covers the period from 1 April 1970 through 31 March 1971.

2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security. The rating period covers his second full year in that position. The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has gained added importance and increased attention during the year. It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole. Mr. O'Connell has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from domestic efforts resulting from national unrest. Mr. O'Connell has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his responsibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to simplify their solutions.

3. During the previous rating period, Mr. O'Connell's performance was considered to be *STRONG* with several outstanding features. During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient addition to the outstanding areas of his performance to raise his over-all rating to *OUTSTANDING*.

Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1969
   through 31 March 1970.

2. The rating period covers the first full year that Mr.
   O'Connell has served as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,
   Technical and Overseas Security at the GS-16 level.

3. The year encompassed in the rating period has seen
   myriad complex and varied additional responsibilities develop
   within Mr. O'Connell's Directorate. Specifically, he has super-
   vised the activation and implementation of the Overseas Security
   Support Division, a new component within the Cffice and an
   extremely important one. He has supervised the first full year
   of implementation of the Interagency Training Center at Hedgeneck,
   Maryland, which falls within the purview of the Chief, Technical
   Division. Finally, he has been a participant in an overall survey
   of the security of the Headquarters Building and has supervised
   the Chief, Physical Security Division in developing and applying
   new physical security techniques and realistic principles of physical
   security. Mr. O'Connell is a capable and efficient supervisor.
   He is a veteran in the Office of Security and has a knowledge of all
   of the various ramifications of the Agency's total security mission.

4. Mr. O'Connell is poised and expresses himself very well, both in oral and written form. I evaluate Mr. O'Connell's performance over the past year as **STRONG** with several outstanding features. I have confidence in his judgment and ability and consider him a valuable career asset of this Office. His has been a difficult task in that as well as assuming new and additional functions, he has been burdened with the supervision of one Division Chief who has proven to be extremely difficult to handle over the years. In fairness to Mr. O'Connell, I should add that no one in this Office has been particularly effective in supervising this individual who is now slated for early retirement. I believe that with this individual's departure Mr. O'Connell should be able to achieve a more coherent integration of his Directorate's functions in the interest of further efficiency and effectiveness.

009784- SEC-SS

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1968 through 31 March 1969.

2. Mr. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security in August 1968 and this Rating covers his performance during this period as well as his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to 1 August 1968.

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security, is responsible for the supervision of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition, he is responsible for providing policy and technical guidance to our Area Security Officers assigned to other components of the Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1968, Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of these varied and complex activities. He is an alert and intelligent supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several significant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division made necessary by the dissolution of this Office's regional security staff in Frankfurt, West Germany. He is an astute manager and an

effective supervisor. He brings to the performance of his duties broad knowledge and experience of security procedures and practices. He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary obligations within his Directorate.

4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to express himself well in both written and oral form. His career is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level performances. He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior Security executive. However, I feel that he has not as yet applied all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance as DD/PTOS. Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chief who is extraordinarily capable and effective in producing results. Conversely, however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. I am convinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and is working hard to achieve the proper supervisory balance. I rate his performance, on balance, as STRONG with many outstanding features. I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office and the Agency.

Chief, Executive Staff

1. Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of this Office from 1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period covered by this Fitness Report.

2. Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective in arranging priority action in meeting short deadlines. As the initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

3. Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advancement and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance in this position over the past year as *OUTSTANDING*.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however, that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and initiative. Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

4. YOUR TRAINING OBJECTIVES
   A broad orientation of the ADP field both in and out of government.

5. EVALUATION OF PROGRAM
   I found the seminar extremely informative and worthwhile from the standpoint of examining the historical progression of the ADP from several points of view. All the speakers were highly qualified in their particular field and their presentations were well prepared. All were exceptionally apt in fielding questions.

Mr. Bert Engelhardt, Associate Director, ADP Management Center, CSC, was a gracious host and handled his role as moderator in a truly professional manner. He has an engaging, friendly personality and is effectively articulate. If I were to single out any weakness it would be Mr. Engelhardt's lecture. He spoke on the Systems Analyst. In his presentation he seemed not to take into consideration the professional level of the group and devoted an inordinate amount of time on basic managerial precepts. This seemed to have an irritating effect on the participants who by virtue of their positions had considerable experience in the management field.

Overall I would say, notwithstanding the above observation, it is an interesting and effective program.

2.  This then covers the period from 9 January 1967 to 31 March 1967. During this period, Mr. O'Connell quickly justified the selection for this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to demonstrate his executive talents in this position.

3.  Although the period for which he is being rated in this position is too short to be characterized definitively or finally, I would say that his progress thus far justifies an unqualified rating of "Outstanding".

This is an annual Fitness Report on the above employee for the period ending 9 January 1967. Mr. O'Connell was reassigned from Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS) to Chief, Security Policy and Executive Staff, and the Director of Security will add comments for the remainder of the rating period ending 31 March 1967.

As Assistant to the DDS(IOS), Mr. O'Connell applied exceptional executive talent in sharing with me the responsibility for the direction of the investigative and operational support programs in the Office of Security. It is felt that Mr. O'Connell made an outstanding contribution to the management of IOS at a time of the heaviest work pressures in our history. Mr. O'Connell has a calm, clinical approach to work problems, and his solutions to these problems reflect the soundness of his judgment and the breadth of his experience. He expresses himself clearly and concisely in both writing and speech. As Assistant DDS(IOS), he demonstrated sound management concepts and acute cost consciousness. His strength as a supervisor is reflected in the universal respect he enjoys among all subordinates.

I regard Mr. O'Connell's performance as ADDS(IOS) as "Outstanding."

(Fitness Report)

1. This is an Annual Fitness Report on the above employee for the period ending 31 March 1966. Mr. O'Connell is currently assigned as Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS), a position he assumed in September 1965. He was promoted to GS-16 at the time he assumed these responsibilities on the basis of a long period of distinguished service that was culminated in his assignment as Regional Security Officer for the Far East.

2. As my Assistant, Mr. O'Connell shares with me the responsibility for the direction of the investigative and operational support programs of the Office of Security. He brings to this position a wealth of experience, sound management concepts, and the ability to meet and solve complex administrative problems. I have implicit confidence in his judgment, and he enjoys the full respect of all of his associates. Mr. O'Connell has made an outstanding contribution to the management and direction of IOS at a time when our work load is the highest in history. He is susceptible to innovation and has a keen appreciation of cost factors in meeting his managerial responsibilities. He has a unique ability to put work problems in the proper focus, does his job without fanfare, and maintains extremely high standards of work accomplishment.

3. Mr. O'Connell's performance fully justifies his promotion to the supergrade level and, in the relatively short time he has been in his current assignment, his overall performance is considered: unusually strong with many outstanding aspects.

MANAGERIAL GRID SEMINAR (50 hours) DATES: 8-13 May 1966

Student : James P. O'Connell, Jr. Cffice : OS

Year of Birth: 1917 Service Designation SS

Grade : 16 No. of Students : 33

EOD Date : December 1951

## COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Culture and Development.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual senso. In Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly assessed, Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.

Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might change his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves.

About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar.

## ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in this course.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: James P. O'Connell
Period: 12 September 1964 - 31 March 1965

chief of the Regional KUSODA Support Staff for nearly three years, is 43 years old and a career employee with more than 13 years service. Although this has been his first overseas tour, he and his family are well adjusted to foreign assignment, and he is apparently able and willing to serve in any position offered.

As the senior KUSODA officer in the Far East, he directs the activities of six officers on his own staff as well as supervises and provides guidance to all other KUSODA officers assigned in the Far East; in addition he monitors the performance of three other KUSODA officers attached to this Station. In this supervisory role, he has an excellent insight into the abilities of his staff and definitely holds the respect of his subordinates.

As the senior KUSODA officer he is my principle adviser on many KUSODA matters. His judgment is mature, his evaluations usually sound. He is dependable and I believe his loyalty to our service and his superiors is above question.

He operates his staff well, is cost conscious and requires an absolute minimum of supervision from Station command.

He maintains excellent liaison relationships with other island services.

will continue to develop and can assume positions of greater responsibility.

I rate this officer as Strong--on the high side.

/s/ James D. Andrews, COS

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: • Period 1 April 1964 - 1 September 1964

A full fitness report was prepared by me on this officer on 15 April and therefore this memorandum, being prepared in connection with my transfer, will merely supplement the previous report.

During the past five months I have had further evidence to substantiate the statements made concerning maturity and dependability. He has been my chief counselor in a recent reappraisal of standards of behavior from a security standpoint. His opinions and advice are always carefully thought through, devoid of fear induced over caution, and realistic.

continues to be a good supervisor. He knows his people, their capabilities and limitations. They respect him for his leadership.

In liaison with other security activities has established excellent relationships which have frequently proven their value. He has considerable talent for liaison which should be kept in mind in selecting his next assignment.

MEMORANDUM IN LISU OF FIRESS REPORT

SUBJECT: James O'Connell, 22-16

Period 31 March 1993, 31 March 1964

James O'Connell is Chief, Regional Security Staff, FE. As such he has performed a fine job in meeting the requirements of FE Stations for security services and in gaining acceptance for the security program. The requirements have been considerably accelerated during past months due to the unsettled conditions in the FE Area. Also support to Headquarters projects has been added to the security office. Perhaps too frequently a job which fails to the station and which cannot be properly identified with one component falls to the Regional Security Staff.

O'Connell while keeping his eye on his primary responsibilities has been most helpful and cooperative in handling secondary duties.

He is a mature officer, seasoned by experience and training. He is calm and poised in crisis situations. His dependability and personality are genuine assets to the Station.

O'Connell is a good supervisor who promotes team work among his people, who is opposed to waste, and has demonstrated his interest in efficiency and economy.

O'Connell makes a sincere effort to separate the Regional Security office from the Station Security office, however, this is difficult if not impossible to do. Perhaps the Station is as much to blame as the overlapping of the various security functions. Surely it is understandable that the Chief of Station wants the best advice he can get on a security matter of concern to him and will turn to the senior officer available. This is an especially tempting resource with such a fine officer as close at hand.

O'Connell

He has responded well to the call for economy and although he has little latitude in this respect he has instituted some restrictions that will result in savings. He writes lucidly and succinctly.

I am pleased that he is to be at this Station for another year.

## SECTION IⅣ

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment.  Descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left; then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion applied to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have no definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

SUBJECT: Commendation for James P. O'Connell, Jr.

1. When Ernest dem Berkaw was moved to Saigon/O'Connell on rather short notice, I named as Acting D/COS. He served in this capacity from early April until his departure on 16 June 1965.

2. Within a matter of days he was performing the assigned duties in a superior manner. He most certainly demonstrated sound judgment, dependability and mature tolerance. The latter is an essential for the daily problems unique to any post type service.

3. As to his executive or leadership qualities I believe I can save several paragraphs by stating simply that within a week of assuming his new assignment I left on a C-day TDY and within 30 days departed south for over 3 weeks and in each case departed with absolute assurance the Station was in good hands, and it was.

4. I would appreciate it if this document could be passed to Chief, KUSODA and if appropriate a copy placed in his personal file.

division. Although a good supervisor, it is recommended that the
training he requests in the field of management be approved; despite
his grade, the organization's mid-career program would probably be
more effective than some external programs.

Reviewer Comments: Subject has placed emphasis on his required responsibility as contrasted to Okinawa security problems. This emphasis plus his personality and professional reputation has enabled a definite contribution to the Regional Far East security function, in spite of the fact that there is an inherent tendency to bypass Okinawa on security matters since it is not in the command channel to all FE Stations.

January 26, 1961

Dear Shel,

I would like to take this opportunity to belatedly express the sincere appreciation of both my office and the Broadcasting Service of this Agency for the assistance rendered by employees of your staff, Mr. James O'Connell and Mr. Ervon Kuhnke in September and December of last year. This assistance consisted of picking up tape recordings prepared by Radio Moscow in the possession of Mr. Paul Frederick Dauer, 1923 De La Vina Street, Santa Barbara, California and delivering them to my office for the information of our Broadcasting Service. In addition to this service, Mr. Kuhnke of your staff readily volunteered to see that these tapes were returned to Mr. Dauer and this latter service was performed last month.

The excellent spirit of liaison co-operation evidenced by your staff is most gratifying to ime and it is hoped that I might be of service in some similar matter in the future.

Sincerely,

Paul J. McNichol, Director
Office of Security

THROUGH : Deputy Director (IOS)

SUBJECT : Commendation

1.  Upon your reassignment from Chief, Operational Support Branch to Deputy Chief, SSD, I wish to forward my personal commendation for your many years of outstanding performance in operational support. You have displayed not only an unusual aptitude in the security handling of support, but have evidenced a highly professional intelligence approach to the many problems given you. As example, I cite a recent case where through certain assets of this office, you arranged for and directed the spotting, recruitment, briefing, cover and cut-out arrangements for an agent engaged in a very sensitive operation of interest to the highest authorities in the Agency, and conducted it on an "Eyes Only" basis.

2.  In this operation, as in many others, you have exercised imagination with both judgment and discretion; all of which has brought great credit to this office, the Deputy Director (IOS), your Division, and, of course, yourself.

3.  I congratulate you and am confident of your continued success in the office and in the Office of Security Career Service.

4.  I am arranging to file copies of this letter in your Personnel and Administrative files.

MEMORANDUR FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT: Commendation of Security Office Personnel

1. It is with pleasure that I wish to pass to your Special Security Division a personal commendation of two officers who have assisted materially in the establishment and continued successful management of the FILTER project.

2. Confronted with a sudden requirement to deploy several security officers to a new activity here in the United States, Fr. James P. O'Connell, Jr., contributed materially to the project in the coordination of several neighborhood checks, re-assignment of several Security Office personnel, the preparation of two safe houses on short notice, and the reception of sensitive alien personnel under the strictest security precautions. Kr. O'Connell has put in many hours on this project, well beyond his normal routine, and several times at great personal inconvenience.

3. I wish, at the same time, to commend specifically the security officer who went under the operational alias of. This officer supervised five other highly qualified and experienced officers in the preparation of elaborate house-breaking safeguards for the first safe house acquired under Project AFFILTER. did his job not only thoroughly but quite cheerfully, despite actual personal hardship.

4. It is all too seldom that the Divisions get around to giving credit where it is due, even in the domestic activities of L/T. In these two cases, however, I feel that this commendation is the least token that can be proffered to two devoted and skilled civil servants.

5. I suggest that copies of this memorandum be included in the personnel files of both Mr. O'Connell and

Dear Joseph,

Please accept my appreciation for an assignment well done as a member of the FY 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/ Clerical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April through 19 May 1978.

I well recognize the complexities involved in the comparative evaluation of 560 clerical careerists -- a task further complicated by this being only the second year it has been undertaken. Your deliberations were vital to the Directorate's determination to bring to this group of valuable employees the advantages of the merit system.

Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards represents a major contribution to the Directorate's program of personnel assessment and management. Not only were your promotion recommendations valued, but recommendations for career development and training were also extremely helpful.

I believe that your service on the Board broadened and sharpened your own focus on personnel aspects of Agency management. Too, I think that the time spent in this endeavor could only have made you better aware of our need for complete, careful and candidly written appraisals of our employees.

Sincerely,

John N. McMahon
Deputy Director for Operations

Having carefully reviewed all personnel files of GS-13 personnel, the FY 78 DO Personnel Evaluation Board recommended that the following officer de identified in his division's Personnel Development Plan (PDP).

23 February 1978

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

FROM : Wesley L. Laybourne
A/Chairman, DO Personnel Evaluation Boards

VIA : Chief, Career Management Staff

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Quality Step Increase
for Joseph S. Piccolo (CI)

1. Mr. Piccolo joined the Agency in 1957 and since then has served 12 years as a field-case officer in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil as well as tours at Headquarters in LA Division and currently on the Cl Staff. He was promoted to GS-13 on 4 February 1973.

2. Mr. Piccolo has performed in a strong to outstanding manner during the past year as described in his fitness report covering the period October 1976 to September 1977. He was engaged during this period in a number of Cl projects, including "a sensitive, multi-level project which has resulted in a neutralization of some Soviet espionage activity abroad." He also was called upon to support Cl activities requiring extensive travel abroad in support of joint Agency and FBI objectives and "he executed these assignments with a singular degree of professionalism." He recently also organized and ran in Spanish a Cl course for foreign liaison and the Station involved described the effort "as an outstanding contribution." During the previous fitness report period he participated in two Cl surveys in Africa and Latin America and because of this experience he was recently named to head another Cl survey to take place in Latin America in the future.

3. It is the view of the Fiscal Year 1978 GS-13 DO Personnel Evaluation Board that Mr. Piccolo has performed in a sustained high manner which exceeds the normal requirements of his position and that this sustained high performance promises to continue. He is, therefore, recommended for a Quality Step Increase.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Joseph S.Piccolo

SUBJECT: Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category

RETERENCE: Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade

1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties, and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed (subject to your signature below) in the functional category- -B/OS for Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are contained in the Ivaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place-ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro-fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STOP THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN CASE CAREFULLY.

2. In general, you should consider the following:

a. Categories are sharply defined. Competition is within categories, not between them. Thus, a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened by reclassifying it as B/OS.

b. A change in category after sustained performance in a different category may cause a temporary loss of momentum in your career advancement until you have demonstrated proficiency in your new assignment.

c. A category change should not be initiated for the period of a temporary, training or rotational assignment inless a permanent change of career track will follow.

3. If you believe that this is not the correct category for you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi-mates another category or because you have made a permanent change of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category. Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the Career Management Staff.

4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to your Personnel Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

Liaison officials join station in extending appreciation to Joseph Piccolo for his outstanding contribution to the current task of moulding the KDSLEUTHS into an effective counterintelligence organization.

Their high degree of enthusiasm was matched only by the professional way in which they prepared their instruction material, the ingenuity of their delivery, and above all the high impact that they had on the students and their superiors.

Wish to complement the above two colleagues for a job well done and for having upheld in their own respective fields the high standards and prestige of the Agency in our eyes and in those of our liaison counterparts.

Request that a copy of this cable be placed in their respective personnel files.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Career Management Staff

SUBJECT : Request for Change of Career Designation to B/OS-Operational Specialist from B/OG- Operational Generalist

1. It is requested that my career designation be changed to B/OS-Operational Specialist from that of B/OG-Operational Generalist. It is believed that the career activities and recent events described below clearly meet the criteria set forth in the Career Service Personnel Evaluation System Handbook.

2. In July 1977, I changed my home base from Latin America Division to the Counterintelligence Staff. This change of home base was precipitated by the cancellation of a planned overseas tour in Latin America which was scheduled to begin in July 1977. The cancellation of the tour was caused by State Department objections to my assignment because of publicity accorded me by Philip Agee and *Counterspy* Magazine.

3. The following is a career summary noting Operational Specialist related activities only:

January 1970 - Present CI Staff

August 1973 - August 1975 Liaison Officer, Managua Station, (Spanish language)

August 1972-June 1973 Liaison Officer, Rio de Janeiro Base, for a Special Project (Portuguese language)

February 1969-December 1969 Liaison Officer, Headquarters, Latin America Division/Cuban Operations (British [MI-6] & U.S. Navy)

April 1968-January 1969 Liaison Officer, Managua Station, (Spanish language)

August 1962-August 1965 Counterintelligence Section, Headquarters, Latin America Division, Cuban Task Force exploiting two intelligence service defectors (Spanish language)

CONFIDENTIAL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

CONFIDENTIAL

4. Based on the above history and more recent activities since joining the CI Staff, I believe my career development and potential will be better realized as an Operational Specialist.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, CS-12, CS Evaluation Board
SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to GS-13,
Joseph S. Piccolo

1. Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo entered on duty with the Agency in February 1957 as a file clerk. He progressed rapidly from that position to that of Intelligence Assistant and subsequent acceptance into the Agency Junior Officer Trainee Program. In addition to Headquarters assignments he has served as operations officer in Mexico City Station (1965-1968) and Managua Station (1968-1969). Since February 1970 he has been assigned to Brasilia Station, Base Rio de Janeiro, where he is serving on an extension of tour until June 1973. He has been in grade GS-12 since September 1968.

2. M.. Piccolo has been consistently evaluated as a very Strong performer in his current grade and this in a variety of assignments which have progressed upwards in responsibility and have included field FI and liaison responsibilities, Headquarters desk officer and liaison officer; up to his current assignment as senior officer in charge of one of the Station's major operational programs, Communist Party and terrorist operations including direct handling of the Station's most sensitive CP agent. He has been evaluated by the Rio de Janeiro Base Chief as the most mature, dependable and competent case officer at the Base. He has excelled in the handling of intricate sensitive penetration operations where the highest professional standards are demanded. He carries a very heavy work load lightly and is a prodigious contributor in both operational and information reporting. His performance as a supervisor has been characterized by conscientiousness, a good sense of detail, perceptiveness, fairness and firmness. Two Chiefs of Station have emphatically endorsed the very


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

high evaluation placed on Mr. Piccolo's performance. His current COS has especially commended him on his handling of a complex current case involving liaison in which Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an unusual grasp of detail, excellent judgment, poise under pressure, and extraordinary stamina. The cos has stated that Mr. Piccolo is already performing well above the GS-13 level.

3. Several supervisors have commented on Mr. Piccolo's quiet unassuming personality which belies the intensity with which he approaches his work. Underlying the quiet manner it has been noted that he is tough-minded and aggressive in his agent handling and exploitation and is highly experienced and skilled in the basic craft of the. intelligence business. He is linguistically talented and can function in both the Spanish and Portuguese languages. lle has had the basic Agency operations courses including some in technical operations. He is also an intelligent _supervisor with a capability for lighting fires under his charges when necessary. He is highly respected and appreciated by all his colleagues and though he maintains a low-profile he moves easily in his official cover circles.

4. Mr. Piccolo has already proven his ability to perform at the next highest grade. Most supervisors have emphasized his potential for assuming ever increasing responsibilities. He has realized this potential with each succeeding assignment and particularly in his current one. He fits both the general and specific criteria for promotion. He has shown himself in possession of the requisite qualities of reliability, seriousness of purpose, imagination, and dedication. He has personally applied the specifics of his profession in a successful manner and has demonstrated his ability to supervise and inspire others in their application as well.

5. Mr. Piccolo's request for a one-year extension of his current tour has been approved. At the culmination of that period an appropriate assignment will be arranged for him commensurate with the Agency's needs, his desires and the continued furtherance of his career.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS/CS Panel (Section B)

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade
GS-12--Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo

1. It is recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted to the grade of GS-12. Mr. Piccolo has been in grade as a GS-11 since September 1966 and is presently serving as an operations officer at Managua, Nicaragua.

2. Mr. Piccolo is a promising young officer who first entered the Agency in 1957 as a clerk in Agency Records section (RI). He also did a tour in the Records Section of the Mexico City Station. After a short separation for military service, Mr. Piccolo returned to the Agency and later was appointed to the Junior Officer Training Program. Since his completion of that program he has served in Headquarters and Mexico City as an operations officer prior to his assignment to Managua in March of 1968.

3. Mr. Piccolo has consistently received high ratings from his superiors in the field and at Headquarters. He is an active operations officer with a special flair for agent handling. He has a good command of the Spanish language, is a dedicated employee of the Agency and has a great deal of growth potential. Since going to Managua he has been in charge of the Managua Station during the homo leave absence of the Chief of Station for a period of almost two months, during which time the Station continued its high level of performance. While this was his first period of his career where he had supervisory responsibility, he did show himself to have ability in this area and is a further indication of his growth potential.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Joseph S. Piccolo

THROUGH: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization Retirement and Disability System

REFERENCE: Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965

1.  You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement and Disability System and have been so designated effective 7 May 1967

2.  Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons, the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.

3.  We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire- ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus, you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CS/CS Panel C

SUBJECT: Proposed Nomination for Promotion to GS-10
Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo

1. Mr. Piccolo's work since completion of the Career Training Program has been reflected in a series of progress reports.

2. At this time, in view of his pending transfer and my own, I should like to recommend him for promotion. His performance to date merits it.

3. As I have stated in his fitness reports and in recommending him for the Career Training Program, Mr. Piccolo already is a capable operations officer and has unusual potential. His experience, common sense and flair for operations make him even now the equal of most officers who are serving in grades considerably higher than his.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career
Service Panel

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion of Mr.
Joseph S. Piccolo.

1. It is recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted
   from GS-7 to G6-8. He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960
   and was assigned to what is now the Special Affairs Staff (formerly
   Task Force W) on 27 August 1962.

2. As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo
   was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency
   policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his being con-
   sidered for GS-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July
1960. On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion
      to GS-8 at a time when he was expected to leave the Agency in order
      to comply with his obligation for military service. The recommendation
      was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited.
      Mr. Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1961 and
      27 August 1962 when he returned to the Agency and began working in
      the CI Branch of the Special Affairs Staff.

3. Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI
   operations and is one of the most promising younger men in the CI
   Branch. His performance since returning from military service has
   been superior in all respects.

4. I am happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotion.

Dear Mr. Piccolo:

We have reviewed your Agency personnel file in connection with your military separation which was effective 4 October 1961.

Our interpretation of Comptroller General rulings indicate that the provisions of Public Law 87-370 would preclude any further military leave for employees in your category during the calendar year 1961. However, this is not viewed as erasing your entitlement to military leave in 1962 for this period of active duty.

Our records reveal that you were granted 3 days military leave in October 1961 for this tour of active duty, and accordingly, we believe that you are entitled to an additional 12 days of paid military leave.

We have enclosed an Application for Leave (Standard Form 71) for your signature and return to us. We will complete the form for you and forward it to your office for their approval.

Very truly yours,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Joseph S. Piccolo

VIA : Chief, WH

1. The problem of effective management of the operational records
   of the Clandestine Services is one of our most important responsibilities.
   In this connection, you have been selected by your Division, and
   authorized by the Clandestine Services Records Committee, to act as
   Records Officer for your component. Your selection is based on your
   professional qualifications to carry out an assignment requiring
   experience, judgment, and a knowledge of the objectives of the Clan-
   destine Services. A copy of this memorandum will be placed in your
   official personnel folder to record your appointment as Records
   Officer.

2. You are to act on behalf of your Division or Staff element
   in authorizing the destruction of material of no value to the Clandestine
   Services in accordance with criteria established for this purpose. You
   are empowered to authorize the destrection of documents and index
   cards recommended for destruction by other members of your Branch,
   and to desensitize KAPOK and RYBAT material which is no longer sensitive
   or which has been restricted in error. Your signature will be recognized
   by RID as that of an officially appointed Records Officer.

3. At the meeting of 15 March 1960, you were briefed on
   the details of your duties as Records Officer. It is now considered
   that you will be able fully to execute your duties as Records Officer
   and thus make a real contribution to the CS Records Management Program.

Although has had some nervous disorder which were aftereffects of a gland virus, he had psychiatric consultation for about five months but no treatment.

# CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

Applicant Information Sheet No. 1

To all persons applying for employment with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the conditions stated below:

## General Considerations:

1.  The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the Agency the responsibility:

a. "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning such.intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the departments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the Government...

d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished centrally;

e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time direct."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 91

The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Government departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive responsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks, includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered. This is called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents his clearance perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware, perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are conclusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Considerations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considerations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

FROM: S. Richelderfer

SUBJECT: Piccolo, Joseph Stephan

Subject was advised this date that the Agency would request a directed deferment. He was told the meaning of a "directed deferment" and advised not to contact his local board and they will not contact him. He was sent to see Captain Noble in Reserve Affairs Branch. Captain Noble was not in and subject was interviewed by Sgt. MacKenzie. I talked to MacKenzie and stressed the fact that subject should be advised to be sure to drop out of the National Guard. Mackenzie said that he would have to request to be put in a standby reserve status. This seems to be a satisfactory arrangement, since we are requesting a directed deferment, the L.B. will not contact Piccolo.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Mexico City Clerical Requirements

1. PAD has attempted to locate two suitable candidates for the WH vacancies who will not be eligible for the draft. Machine runs were used, as were file referrals, checks with approriste Administrative and Personnel representatives in Agency components, and a thorough screening of Tables of Organization. A total of 25 individuals at the GS-5 or lower level were checked out. One candidate was located, a Mr. William G. Rawls, Clerk, GS-4 with WB. He has been accepted by the Division for the January requirement. The January deadline was chosen for him because he will be able to pass the typing requirement for State integration. We had no success in finding a candidate for the 1 November deadline. All of the others were disqualified, largely because of marriage, unwillingness to accept the assignment.

2. Under the circumstances, it is recommended that Mr. Rawls be processed against the January requirement and that Mr. Joseph Piccolo, who was originally submitted for the November departure, be processed for the assignment, and that a directed deferment be requested for him.

Mr. Piccolo has now received SSS Form No. 80 (Standby Reserve Questionnaire). Due to circumstances beyond his control, Mr. Piccolo is unable to complete this form, which is enclosed. Please return it to the local board with the instruction that it not be re-mailed until such time as the Director withdraws his directed classification of Mr. Piccolo under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended.

For The Director,

DANIEL O. CHER
Colonel, JAGC
General Counsel

Enclosure

Mr. Piccolo's experience in LA Division and Cuban operations, his inquisitive instincts, his activist style and his keen analytical skills, superbly qualify him to serve as the senior CI Staff coordinator for LA Division. One obvious measure of his strong, continued effectiveness, is that in any given week he receives more requests for guidance, CI file reviews, and other forms of CI support, than any of our other area division coordinators. On the other hand, because of his in-depth, across the board knowledge of LA's operational activities, he represents a unique resource to C/CI when the latter has to respond knowledgeably and rapidly to inquires from the DDO level on LA related matters. On that score alone, C/CI has commented on his deep satisfaction with Mr. Piccolo's impressive performance.

During the year, Mr. Piccolo led the team which conducted an in-depth CI and Operational Security Survey of Brasilia Station and its two Bases. The final report was well received by the Division and the Station, which began implementing certain of the team's suggested recommendations before its return to Headquarters. As with other CI survey reports, the Brasilia study was forwarded to the DDO and the DCI for their information. Mr. Piccolo is one of the more experienced survey officers, having participated in or led five station survey exercises in AF and LA Divisions.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Mr. Piccolo is a very competent, serious and ambitious officer. As the senior CI coordinator for LA Division, he has represented the Staff extremely well and, more importantly, has ensured rapid, professional and informed follow-up on counter-intelligence problems and leads in that active area. He knows his client division well, his advice and support are regularly sought, and he has an unusual ability to penetrate to the essentials of a given operational matter. All with whom he deals in LA Division hold him in high esteem.

The operational traffic Mr. Piccolo screens for the "front office" is usually accompanied by pertinent insights on the significance of the development or event reported. He has been praised more frequently for his commentaries than any of our other coordinators, which is another reflection on his intimate familiarity with the LA operational scene. Numerous examples of his productive and versatile service to the Division and Staff can be cited but we will note for the sake of brevity only three to underscore out point. (1) For the past two years he has been the guiding and principal referent on a joint Agency/FBI proposal which would enable the FBI to engage in foreign CI operations against the Soviet intelligence services on the Mexican side of the border. His perseverance, in shepherding the instrument through its various approval-stages in the Agency and the Department of Justice, is finally paying off with the recent notification that the SCC/CI had informally approved the agreement. (2) This past summer Mr. Piccolo was temporarily assigned to assist NE Division as a consultant, because of his Brasilian expertise, in a case involving a Brazilian walk-in who claimed PLO connections. Ultimately Mr. Piccolo participated directly in the interrogation assessment process, and was a key factor in finally persuading the Brazilian to return to Brasil to work in place against the PLO. Finally (3), he has quite justifiably earned the reputation (per student critiques and faculty commentary) as one of the most effective instructors on the CI Staff. He lectures, regularly in the CI and BOC courses, and participates in the Walk-Ins and Doubled Agent seminars for our military and FBI colleagues.

Again, Mr. Piccolo's performance during this past year, as in previous years, reflected a sustained superior effort, which, I am convinced, will continue to be the pattern in the future..

## SECTION E REVIEWING COMMENTS (continued)

Rating officer properly highlights Mr. Piccolo's determination and perseverence in pushing a major joint CIA-FBI program through Washington's often unbelievable bureaucracy. A lessor man would have thrown in the towel long ago. Mr. Piccolo, understanding the importance of this proposal, was determined to "hang in there;" success resulted.

A veteran CI survey officer, Mr. Piccolo headed a team inspecting Brasilia Station during this year. Perceptive identification of a number of potential counterintelligence and operational security problems, have induced this Station to take certain corrective action and its future operational programs will surely benefit from these.

Major contamination via Philip Agee has severely limited this officer's ability to serve in his area of specialty, Latin America. Nonethelons, we need to identify in the not too distant future a challenging overacas assignment that will take advantage of his fepressive operational skills and experience. He is patently an officer with highly developed on-the-street instincte amt, if he is to achteve his considerable potential, needs additional overseas postinga。

In the meantime we are fortunato Indeed to have his on our staff; he is one of our best. I unhealuatingly concur in the Rating Officer's letter grades and narrative comente.

During the period under review Mr. Piccolo was the senior referent in the Branch for LA Division affairs. In this capacity he functioned most effectively and efficiently, and fully exploited his more than 17 year's association with LA Division.

With respect to Specific Duties, No's 3 and 5 are pretty much self explanatory and are the bread-and-butter type activities that provide you a data base for approaching other responsibilities and keep you au courant of operational conditions. There is no rating for No. 4 as this activity this year was handled by O/C/CI.

In terms of Specific Duty No. 1. Mr. Piccolo has had several field station assignments in LA Division plus several at Headquarters. He maintains close and continuing contact with country desks and staff officers and when appropriate has initiated operational comments and suggestions. For example, when reviewing the traffic from an on island Cuban reporting source he noted indications that the source might be under hostile control, and sent forward a memorandum outlining these indications to COG while defering to them for further action. On another occasion when a walk in appeared at an overseas Station he again approached COG

This Fitness Report is one of the most thorough and balanced from a substantive view which I have reviewed in some time. I find it to be accurate from my perspective and reflects my own contention that Mr. Piccolo is for his grade one of the most productive, aggressive and versatile officers we have in the DO.

Earlier this year Mr. Piccolo received a QS! in recognition of his fine performance on the CI Staff during the previous year. There is no question that a sustained superior effort on Mr. Piccolo's part will continue to be the pattern in the future. He has a prosperous career ahead of him.

and outlined to them the reasons he believed the walk-in was a provo- cation. COG agreed to withold any attempts at operational exploitation until the walk-in's *bona fides* were better established. The walk-in subsequently failed a polygraph on the question was he being directed at us.

With respect to Duty No. 2, usually focused on the activities of USAINTA while his colleague focused on those of OSI. In any event, each could readily fill in as substitute if the other were absent. The range of operational initiatives available to us in these cases is, for the most part, limited and our main in-put is in terms of area knowledge and operational experience, Nevertheless, Mr. Piccolo did address him- self to the problem of coverage of controlled U.S.: Person double agents when travelling overseas and drafted a general consent agreement for agents to sign permitting us CI coverage of them while abroad. The suggestion is in the hands of the military services the FBI and Agency legal authorities and its ultimate fate is not known.

In terms of ad hoc assignments Mr. Piccolo has participated in two CI Operational Surveys, namely Buenos Aires and Bogota. In both instances he was the team leader. A CI Survey is defined as an in depth review of a Stations operational activities designed to detect efforts by and determine the capabilities of foreign intelligence services to carry out recruitment, penetration, provocation and deception operations and to evaluate the threat these pose to the Station. The Surveys are time consuming and taxing, requiring a review of all pertinent Headquarters files, a visit to the Station to review field files and interview all operational personnel, and then return to llqs. to compile a report that may run as few as fifty pages or more than one hundred. The reports are addressed to the COS and the DDO, although the DCI has instructed that he be routinely included on the distribution of each report. Mr. Piccolo's level of performance is reflected in the fact that Bogota was his fourth survey.

In another ad hoc activity Mr. Piccolo was responsible for retriev- ing a proposal regarding joint activities with the FBI in a very sensitive area from the Bench Mark paper being submitted to the National Security Council/Special Coordination Committee NSC/SCC) on counterintelligence procraes, and suggesting that it be submitted jointly with the FBI to appropriate USG authorities. This suggestion is currently being imple- mented and in so doing has required consultation and meetings with the IBI free the working level to very senior officers.

Mr. Piccolo is an experienced and professional officer requiring a minima of supervision. He is aggressive, imaginative and has demonstrated his initiative. He writes well and is even stronger in his verbal skills. He can defend his position vigorously and skillfully but is disciplined and will accept the final decision if contrary to his own view without Housing. He has an engaging personality.

Mr. Piccolo in the fulfillment of these assorted tasks of the Branch has demonstrated discretion, tact, flexibility, open mindedness, operational knowhow and good common sense. He is viewed as a highly experienced, completely dependable officer, requiring a minimum of supervision. He does, however, know when to seek guidance and accepts it with good cheer. His approach to operational problems is based on a solid appreciation of what is required and is not afraid to express his views on a problem when necessary, but he will implement a decision once made. These attributes coupled with his fairness, single minded approach to his work and dedication, mark him as a professional in the true sense of the word.

I have known Mr. Piccolo since early this year and have been much impressed by his professionalism, conscientiousness and capacity for just plain hard work. He has done everything that we have asked him to do quickly and well. His work both on the sensitive and productive CI project mentioned by the rating officer and on several counterintelli gence surveys has been consistently first-rate. He thinks well and he writes well. Based on his broad field experience, his language skill and his deep dedication to the Agency, he would appear to have consider able growth potential. He is one of our very best officers. I unhesi tatingly concur in the rating officer's letter grades and narrative comments.

SECTION D NARRATIVE COMMENTS - /Continued/

In addressing the specific duties, Mr. Piccolo has been engaged during the past year in the exploitation of a sensitive multi-lead CI Project which has resulted in a neutralization of some Soviet espionage activity abroad. In the furtherance of this project he supervised, with an even hand, one intelligence assistant. Mr. Piccolo has been called upon to support CI activities requiring extensive travel abroad in support of joint Agency and FBI objectives. He executed these assignments with a singular degree of professionalism. Recently he organized and ran a CI training course for foreign liaison. This required the preparation of course material in Spanish and personally delivering lectures in the Spanish language. The Station described this effort as an outstanding contribution to the current task of molding the liaison service into an efficient and effective counterintelligence organization. More recently, based on previous experience and participation in CI Operational Surveys, he has been designated to head a CI Survey team going to Latin America. Finally, during the period of this report, due to the absence of the Branch Chief, Mr. Piccolo has served well as the Acting Branch Chief and during his tenure kept work flowing smoothly, efficiently and without change of pace. To sum up, Mr. Piccolo is in the opinion of this rater a solid first class officer whose judgment is totally dependable and whose accomplishments have been significant. We would commend Mr. Piccolo for any assignment in field operations above any of his peers.

Mr. Piccolo joined the Ct Staff at his initiative and has served in several different roles in the period of this report. These included positions as survey officer in the Area Operations Branch for six months, operations officer in the Special Operations Branch for three months and then acting chief of that branch for two months. Overall he has performed his duties in these positions with efficiency and thoroughness.

During the six month period Mr. Piccolo was assigned to the Area Operations Branch, his duties consisted of participation in CI operational surveys of two countries, e.g., Ethiopia and Peru. By way of explanation, Cl operational survey is defined as an in-depth review, both at leadquarters and in the field, of a Station's operational activities in order to detect efforts by and determine the capabilities of foreign intelligence services to accomplish recruitments, penetrations, provocations and deception operations plus an evaluation of the threat these pose to future operations and assets. The surveys are conducted by a team of two or more operations officers and their final report may be 100 or more pages in length. The report is addressed to the DDO and the Area Division Chief and gives them a detailed CI profile of the Station.

SECTION D - NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)

The two countries which Mr. Piccolo helped survey represent widely varying operational and social environments. In both instances, however, the Station Chiefs cabled Headquarters at the end of the field aspect of the survey complimenting the team on the thoroughness and understanding with which they conducted the survey, and conumented on the usefulness and practicality of the team's recommendations. It should noted that these cables had considerable impact on DIO management and were used widely in the extension of the survey program into other areas.

Although Mr. Piccolo's field exposure has been exclusively in the Latin American area, he has a widely varied operational background, having served in varying operational capacities in several stations, and he is perceptive in his understanding of operational realities. His personality is positive and outgoing, and in most instances he is able to initiate very quickly a responsive dialogue with fellow officers. He is adaptable in outlook and reads quickly and with understanding; qualities almost indispensible in an activity of this kind. Im sum, Mr. Piccolo approached both Surveys with enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility, completed his written report (he had a different partner in each case) promptly and accurately. He un- doubtedly would have been engaged in a third survey except his temporary tour ended and he was assigned permanently elsewhere in the Staff.

In his duties in the Special Operations Branch, Mr. Piccolo has excelled in his management responsibilities in the sense of both getting the work out of his people and in getting along with them. He is on good terms with all of them. He has shown good CI mentality and a thoroughness which is essential to good CI work. His dedication to his work is shown by his punctuality in the morning and his presence in his office well after five most evenings. His production as operations officer has been steady and thorough for both of the projects for which he has responsibility. Unfortu- nately, he experienced a period of ill health following a hectic TDY; however, he returned to duty at the first opportunity and resumed his duties with vigor. Ilis versatility was recently demonstrated by his participation in a joint meeting with representatives of a foreign service over a period of several days and evenings during which he proved fully effective in achieving Agency objectives in a liaison and social environment.

The most impressive aspect of Mr. Piccolo's performance and one deserving special mention in this fitness report is his ability with the written word. It is fully accurate to say that the survey reports to which he contributed were mich better written than were those of his peers. He has the ability to describe an operational situation in terms which are at the same time mean- ingful, concise and easy to read. It is a pleasure to read his material and to compliment him on this ability in this report.

This is an end of tour report covering the fourteen months in which this Officer has been under my supervision. Managua Station has just submitted its first Statement of Accomplishment Goals under the newly-established MBO reporting system and schedule. Consequently, this report combines Subject's duties as specified in two previous LOI's which run from 1 June 1974 to 30 May 1975 and from 1 June 1975 through 31 July 1975. The duties listed are therefore broader than those to be reflected in the latest LOI now being formulated as a logical adjunct to the new MBO format and content.

(*) (On specific duties No. 5 and 6, there is so little content or substance associated with these duties as to make a Letter Rating meaningless. The Narcotics target in Nicaragua is practically non- existent and there is no current need for technical operations to support approved operational activities. The duties are listed only because they were included in the LOI.)

DUTY NO. 1

Responsible for the operational program against the communist and extremist target, this officer handles three agents and a contract agent in a highly proficient manner. (See Attached Sheet)

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

The assessment given above of Mr. Piccolo's performance seems to be well-balanced and generally fair. His performance as described fits with my knowledge of it. It should be noted that it is very difficult to establish much of an operational record in Managua because of the lack of intelligence targets and the low level of community interest in developments in Nicaragua. It is to his credit that Mr. Piccolo was able to recruit in the only target available--the terrorist FSLN.

Mr. Piccolo is poised and quiet in demeanor. He is a reliable, dependable officer of good judgment.

I agree with the rater that Mr. Piccolo should be given the opportunity to do something different. A rotational tour to another DDO component would probably be very helpful to his overall development and motivation at this time. I concur in the overall assessment of his performance as "Strong."

I certify that I have seen entries in this report.

SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

He handles a contract agent who, in turn, handles a low level penetration of the orthodox communist party. This marginal asset is kept on the payroll at a modicum cost for the purpose of filling gaps, and for spotting, until better coverage can be developed. The contract agent, whose administration is almost identical to that required for a NOC, also produces information on the extremist target through his marital connections.

Also handled under Duty No. 1 is a high level member of a legal political party of socialist persuasion, which has traditinally demonstrated a propensity for cooperation with the communists and/or extremists in Nicaragua. This paid agent produced twenty eight intelligence reports with a Value Quotient (VQ) average of 4.07 over this period. This agent, handled directly, requires and receives close and alert guidance. He has provided valuable spotting information, which the Case Officer has followed up, accomplishing the full cycle of assessment, development and successful recruitment of a member of the communist youth organization, who will be targetted against both the communist youth, the orthdox party, and hopefully, into the FSLN (terrorist organization.)

Acting upon a lead from ERHATCHET-2, a former media asset, this Officer also contacted, assessed, developed and recruited a student who was formerly with the Revolutionary Students Front (FER-support arm of the FSLN terrorist organization.) This asset is being targetted against the FER and FSLN.

Considering the paucity of leads available on the elusive but important FSLN target, (a Priority 1 Objective of the Station), these two recent recruitments are judged to be very significant achievements, attributable to this Officer's language fluency, sincerity, experience and style, which makes it all look easier than it really is.

Subject has been criticized in his last two Fitness Reports for not developing new assets into the key target area (terrorists). It is important, therefore, to recognize his efforts and achievements now, as detailed above. He had never been a strong recruiter, but had always been an above-average agent handler who could extract more information and services

NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)

from agents than most Case Officers. His two new recruitments represent the Station's most promising propects against the FSLN in the long history of FSLN operations in Nicaragua. It is suggested that this Officer's contribution of only two recruitments (at the very end of his tour of duty) could well be more meaningful and productive than the efforts of a super-salesman whose acquisitions later prove to be marginal or useless.

DUTY NO. 2

Subject conducts Station liaison at the working level with two contacts. His main job is the maintenance of the relation- ship, an effort handicapped by political considerations which oblige him to take but never give, to cancel scheduled training, and to maintain a low profile. Nevertheless, he does manage to extract information of interest on the terrorist and political targets, and the relationship does provide him with access to certain military officers who are being assessed and developed. Additionally, this Officer shares the task with the COS of conducting liaison at the policy level, an even more difficult, and less productive effort. Subject's warm and winning personal- ity and extensive experience are key factors in his ability to maintain the relationship at all, which results in clear net gain to the Organization.

DUTY NO. 3

Subject has done exceedingly well in the development and cultivation of ERLANK-1 for gradual recruitment as an agent of influence. PRQ Parts I and Il have been submitted, and ERLANK-1 is responding to Subject's overtures of friendship, ERLANK-1 has agreed to a turn-over, and this was accomplished very recently.

DUTY NO. 4

In this very small Station, the DCOS function is not a critical one, but when obliged to exercise his authority in this

NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)

function, Subject has done very well. More importantly, in his several stints as ACOS (during COS illness which required hospitalization and medical consultations out of country), Subject really shone in his performance. He was obliged to deal with the most difficult Ambassador ever encountered by this rater, and represented and protected Station interests with skill and dignity.

Subject requires little supervision, by virtue of his thorough knowledge and extensive experience in practically every aspect of the mechanics of clandestine operations in Latin America. His avocation is "Administration", in the full sense of the word, and he administers his work load impeccably. The assignment just completed was his first command job, and he has acquired the additional managerial skills necessary for sim to progress in his career. There is no question of his additional potential, and it is natural to envision him as a Deputy Chief of Station at a larger Latin American Station, or, better, as a Chief of Base in his next field assignment. He is above average in security and cost-consciousness. He is fluent not only in Spanish, but also in Portuguese, and more importantly, in human retions. He can establish rapport with people at all levels of society.

His personality is a pleasant one. lle is low-keyed, soft-spoken, sincere and methodical and catablishes natural excellent rapport with his co-workers, both subordinate and superior. While easy to get along with, he still nows how to effectively administer training, guidance, advice and discipline to his subordinates without alienating them,

This rater has gotten on well with subject. His experience, self-confidence and directness are such, however, that he might well be difficult to supetitse if there acte any kind of personality clash involved. In aus he knobs what he is doing. and would be inclined to rearnt and testat advise of guidance which he might judge as unsound. ahile sunt alght consider the trait a shortcoming, this later welders it a attength, overall.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)

If forced to search for a deficiency in his performance over the past fourteen months under my supervision, it would be necessary to point to a weak showing in operational and representational entertaining. In the former category, particularly, he could have spent more of his weekend and night hours with Liaison/Military and other contacts for developmental purposes. In his regular work hours, however, which included some nights and weekends, he was more than gainfully employed in the accomplishment of his assigned duties. He is not a clock-watcher, but stays with the Liaison, and agent meetings, as well as with the paperwork until they are completed.

This Officer is the victim of personnel requirements, which has resulted in an Organizational failure to challenge his talents and ingenuity. His re-assignment to the Cuban Operations Section next, for example, will be his fifth assignment in that area in 15 years. It is recommended that he obtain rotational experience in another geographical or functional area, to broaden him.

(The following is directly keyed to Subject's "Letter of Instructions")

As ACOS he has demonstrated a thorough understanding of Agency policies and regulations. He works well with those he supervises and has exhibited unusual patience while diligently instructing and correcting employees. During my absences, he has worked well with Senior members of the Embassy and has been accepted by Embassy and Station personnel alike as a mature, sensible and experienced officer.

As Liaison Officer for the Station, hohas done an excellent job of improving the effectiveness of the "Special Unit" by offerring his expertise, improving their physical working conditions and convincing them to expand their horizons. The unit appears to be responding well to his leadership and should prove more productive in the future.

His handling of a sensitive unilateral contact in Liaison has resulted in obtaining what information the contact is willing to disclons. Although categorized as a ponotration, the oporation is more that of a contact who is willing to provide inside information to clarify certain cituations and events rather than an agressive penetration seeking all that lies behind the scenos. This is a principal liaison contact with whom a good working relationship must be maintained and such a relationshi does exist.

He has made very little progress in operations against the liarcotica target. Subject inherited very little in sources and has not developel any new prospects. (Continue)

| This sooms to be a fair report which rates Subject about the same way that I would, based on my understanding of his performance. Subject is a mature and competent officer who does a fine job of handling existing operations and administrative tasks but has not been very aggressive in developmental work. The sleepy tropical atmosphere of Managua may not be very inspiring operationally, but new business is needed and Subject is believed to be capable of turning in a stronger performance in that area. He has the potential for further career advancement. |

Section C - Narrative Comments (Continued)

Subject's performance is strong in handling the present unilateral sources directed against the internal domestic target. Specifically, he has a thorough understanding and knowledge of the Christian Socialist and Communist Parties, Subject, however, has not made an effort to develop new potential sources.

In summation. it is clear that Subject has the background, experience and knowledge to perform the tasks in an outstanding manner. Some of these tasks, those that interest him most, he does very well now, Others, that he has determined are not of sufficient value or interest, he disregards. Where Subject must take steps to improve is in his overall attitude towards work to be accomplished. This being a very small station can be a handicap to an officer who must work harder to produce the little intelligence of interest that is available. Subject must spend more of his free time among the local community in an attempt to expand his contacts, contacts that could result in the development and recruitment of now sources.

Subject is well liked and accepted by the American Community. He and his wife entertain well and his good command of the local language makes him a strong member on this very small team.

Subject keeps excellent records and has done much to improve the records management of the Station. He is careful with organizational funds and his bookkeeping is consistently up to date.

Subject is an exceptionally responsible and mature officer who also combines with these virtues outstanding ability in the fine tuning, analysis and direction of highly complex human cases. During the period under review he handled a most complex and delicate exploitation and termination of a high level ALSOBER penetration with CKPOLAR ramifications with a substantial degree of success. He has also served, in his capacity as deputy base chief, as counsellor and provider of guidance to case officers concerning virtually all of the Base's operations and particularly the more complex and difficult agent cases. His unusually keen intuition and perceptiveness have consistently helped the Base to avoid pitfalls and recognize important but obscure operational factors. His operational judgement is extremely sound.

During the period under review Subject has had an opportunity to demonstrate his ability as a supervisor and the results have been impressive. He is naturally careful and thoughtful as well as objective in his dealings with people and he adds elements of sensibility and sympathy as well which enable him to get good responses and inspire confidence. Case officers and other personnel tend to gravitate to him naturally seeking help and guidance and he gives of himself generously in these situations. He has shown excellent leadership potential also during the occasions on which he has taken over as acting base chief and has not been afraid to take

I concur in this excellent rating in all respects. The performance of this fine officer has been superior. He played a crucial role at the Base. He is a strong considerate supervisor with potential for growth. The failure to get out on the street and recruit during the past year (I am not familiar with previous experience) can be partly attributed to immersion in the complex, time consuming surfacing/disposal case, but must also be attributed partly to his personality (or at least his mood at that stage of his tour). Subject is perhaps more comfortable, or seemed to be during the rating period, handling going agents (Indigenous and NOC's) which he does superbly, (continued)

new initiatives during these occasions, after due thought and consultation, if he thought they were warranted. And he has been an excellent judge of men (and women) and their quality. In his dealings with LNFALL, its various LNBUZZ agencies and their directors he has held up the Base's interests and image well while seeking fair and practical answers and solutions. He has a good sense of economy in monetary as well as other affairs. As he becomes moro senior and more exclusively a supervisor and executivo he should become more and more effective.

Subject is an excellent operational manager and agent handler who gets the best out of his assets. He is probably not so strong as an operational starter and developer and this appears to bo duo in part to an instinct to avoid exposure and eschew the glad hand. On the other hand, he has undertaken two rather difficult developmental operations starting from scratch during the past six months and has at least proven that he can do this kind of work when it is necessary. In both these cases he may have tried to move too fast in order to reach recruitment point before his departure but this is understandable. His written work is woll conceived and conscientious and perhaps even somewhat above average for case officers of his grade and experience. Like most BKHERALD officers, however, he does not take sufficient pains to achieve simple, clear, forceful expression with the result that, while his best efforts are effective his second best is apt to result in lack of organization and clarity. He should work on this - a suggestion might be that he practice avoiding metaphors and adopt a straight declarative sentence style.

In conclusion, Subject's performance has been first class in the most important respects and his relatively minor weaknesses are not incurable. He should have an excellent future as a senior case officer and supervisor, particularly if he attacks and cures these weaknesses. His overall performance in his present tour has been very strong indeed.

plotting operational strategy (another very strong point), advising less experienced officers (he demonstrated considerable talent here) than he is going after new assets. Subject clearly has the brains, the poise, the empathy and the all-around appeal to do so. There is no doubt about his being able to devise and execute sound recruitment scenarios and pitches. He did not, however, get to the "critical" point during this past year and he understood the priority which Division and Station management was attaching to new recruitments. Subject more than earned the promotion to GS-13 recently accorded. In my judgment he should be given the opportunity to move quickly to the next higher grade. In many aspects of the Base/Station mission he has already demonstrated to my satisfaction that he has the ability to become a valued senior officer of our organization. At an appropriate point he should be a candidate for senior school training.

The rating of Strong is deserved. This is a really fine officer, very corebral, experienced and skilled in the basic craft of our business, linguistically talented, toughminded and agressivo in agont handling and exploitation. His lack of developmont/recruitmont activity during the reporting poriod reflects to some degree a deliborato decision to keep a low profile in the Mission and in the city duo to the particularly sensitive nature of ongoing projects handled. This still applies to some degree but we all now agroo that during tho remaining months of his tour an effort can be made to exploit this officer's considerable talents in the crucial area of creating now assets.

Subject is perhaps the most maturo, dependable and compotent case officer we have. Ho has excelled in the handling of intricato, sensitive penetration oporations wirero the highest professional standards aro demanded. He carries a very heavy work load lightly and is a prodigious contributor in both operational and information reporting. His performance as a supervisor has been characterized by conscientiousnoss, a good sense of detail, perceptiveness, fairness and firmness. lle is at his best in practical situations, however complex and obscuro, rather than in dealing with philosophical or theoretical problems but this is obviously more a matter of inclination, than of intellect. Ho is highly respected and appreciated by all his colleagues and especially by this supervisor.

Subject is under grade for his porformance, experience and responsibilities. He is of all the Baso officers most deserving of a promotion. A separate recommendation to this effect is being forwarded.

This rating officer has worked with Subject on a number of assignments over the past ten years.

Only a few days before this report Subject was on-the-scene supervisor of a professionally conducted recruitment attempt. In such operations his experience against a hard target (PBRUMEN) has been evident.

Subject is a good manager of JKLANCERS, including one on his first overseas tour, and indigenous agents, including one of considerable international access. He makes them all work on target. Under his supervision one of the Station's moderately useful agents has successfully been moved into the extremely important terrorist area. Subject uses imagination in his day-by-day work (and handles Station JMROD assignments).

LANGUAGE TRAINING AIMS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

The general aim of this course of study was to orovice the student with a command of a foreign language in a skill and at the level set by the sponsoring office. Speaking, aural comprehension and reading comprehension, as required, were emphasized. Fluency and accuracy were given equal importance in training and in evaluation of the student. Cultural matters were covered only incidentally.

This student evaluation is based on (1) Instructor and Linquist observations; (2) regularly administered oral and written achievement tests; (3) a final comprehensive achievement examination.. The achievement rating reflects only performance and achievement in the course and is conditioned by the length of time the student spent in training, achievement potentiel based upon his or her aptitude for language study and upon motivation. This rating should not be confused with the Proficiency Rating which is submitted separately on Form 1273, Certification of Language Proficiency.

PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING COURSE AIMS

(Overall progress in the course is shown as unsatisfactory, marginal, satisfactory, above average, superior when compared against established standards for such training).

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

This student, with no experience in Portuguese, held his own extremely well in a class with three other students, all of whom had had previous training in the language.

He did especially well in pronunciation and soon succeeded unusually well in eliminating any interference from Spanish. Because of his knowledge of Spanish, the student's ability to read and understand is greater than his ability to speak.

His mastery of the course material was very good. His oral use of the language was generally limited to short sentences. In longer sentences he had a tendency to get lost in mistakes of syntax. He was almost always aware of his mistakes and would correct them himself, at the completion of a sentence, He always responded well to correction.

The areas in grammar presenting problems were 1) use of the subjunctive 2) a tendency to overlook, or sidestep, idiomatic expressions 3) failure to

use the preposition with certain verbs requiring the use of a preposition with dependent infinitives.

In my judgment, the student already has the ability to use the language effectively in basic, every-day situations. After a matter of months in the foreign environment he should be able to function effectively in all job-related situations. Because he was extremely diligent and conscientious, he would be an excellent candidate for further language training.

In short, Subject is a solid, professional officer, with his eye and his actions always on the target. Ho maintains his forward thrust within a framework of prudent judgment, and is maturely deliberate in deciding to take a risk. That's the name of the game.

It is requested that Subject's namo be placed on the list of officers being considered for promotion.

(This report is being written not by, but after consultation with, Subject's immediate supervisor, who is temporarily assigned elsewhere. The writer is one step removed from "Immediate super- vision of Subject and has worked with him only since October 1969. In what follows, there is no difference of opinion between the supervisor and the writer, and statements not specifically attributed to one or the other represent the judgment and observation of both.)

Subject is an experienced officer whose primary field, on-island agents, is by definition difficult and frustrating and has recently become more so owing to developments beyond his control. Despite this situation he has continued to support successfully the most productive Cuban in-place FI agent that the Agency has.

The compromise of a major on-island operation during the reporting period was due not to any deficiency on Subject's part but rather to a general lack of Agency control over the operation from its inception. In any case, it is to Subject's credit that he wrote a candid and thorough analysis and damage report on the case (Writer).

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL Based on 3 months experience in dealing with subject I have found him to be a thoroughly professional operations officer who shows good judgement and makes good use of his field experience in carrying out his function as COG's on-islands case officer. He performs with a minimum of supervision and is most perceptive in monitoring activities and events related to his area of activity. I believe Mr. Piccolo has considerable potential for moving up to more important positions.

/continued/

Subject's in-house liaison has-boon_effective, as has his liaison with the Navy FOSG (Supervisor). It does not appear that liaison with the representa-tive of MI-6 in Havana for the exploitation of operational matters has been used to its fullest potential, although it should also be noted that this responsibility is not purely Subject's.

Subject appears to be a thoughtful and ef-fective supervisor who is concerned with the further training and development of those under his super-vision (Supervisor).

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable. This officer made excellent progress in working with the liaison service and was notable in his efforts to organize and train, and direct rather than simply sit back and accede the intelligence product. His liaison operation is the single most important operation of Station Managua and it could not have been in better hands. His working relationships with personnel of the liaison service were based on mutual friendship and respect and that service was assorry to see him leave as was the Station. He also earned the friendship and respect of his colleagues and cover facility personnel of all levels and had rare success in his dealings with administrative personnel of the cover facility, a most uncooperative lot.

It is difficult for the rating officer to stand back and be flatly objective about this fine employee who is a friend of many years standing and who impressed the rating officer years ago as an officer of rare potential. His tour in Managua was cut short by a personal tragedy (illness and death of a minor dependent) which set into motion a transfer which could not later be reversed. Despite the pressures of this tragedy, this employee performed at a high level throughout this service in Managua and both he and his charming wife proved outstanding examples of "true grit." His tour in Managua proved him once again to be a mature, competent professional who should be able to advance to high positions in the organization. He accepts responsibility well--acted without hesitation (continued).

## SECTION C, continued

when serving as Acting Chief of Station during the COS' absence on home leave. He has rare ability to see the relevant and has the courage of his convictions--will arque a point. Physically slow moving--given to ambling like a tired old -bear--he can be quite deceiving in an age which seems to specialize in rapidly moving young men-on-the-go. There is no wheel spinning about this officer and no sham. He has his eye on the future and moves along relentlessly in that direction.. Obstacles bother him but don't deter him. He is in short a steady, dependable man with forward momentum.

One area in which he could use some improvement is in his writing. This has been discussed with him. The rating officer has recommended that he take a course in effective written English. His writing is at times vague and convoluted.

His fine performance was rewarded in September 1968 with a much-merited grade promotion so he cannot be recommended for promotion at this time. It is recommended, however, that he be given a position with head room to allow for advancement to higher grade as soon as he is eligible. The rating-officer would be pleased to serve with this officer at any time, any place.

This young case officer has displayed considerable professionalism after only a relatively short time in the clandestine operations field. He is very versatile and resourceful and has shown a high amount of initiative. He is at his best as an agent handler and has developed close relationship with the assets entrusted to him. He has been helped in this by a high degree of fluency in Spanish and his pleasant personality. His reporting, particularly his calbe writing still leave room for improvement, but on the whole, this officer has been one of the mainstays of the PBRUMEN Section during his tour, which unfortunately has been marred by poor health.

This employee has turned in a consistently fine performance since his assignment to Mexico City. Every going operation assigned to him has shown marked improvement under his tutelage, most notably the FURUMEN refugee operation which has finally developed into a highly productive enterprise under the guidance of this officer. He is handling a sensitive PBRUMEN double agent case in a most professional manner. His operational reporting is exemplary and his writing style, once somewhat obtuse, has shown steady improvement. Despite a relatively short period in the role of field case officer, he has won the admiration and respect of colleagues and agent assets alike. He has a winning way with people - a reflection of his sincere interest in them. He has a high degree of initiative and drive, is imaginative and resourceful. In operations he shows a welcome degree of aggressiveness. His supervisory ability, except as exercised indirectly through others, has not yet been sufficiently put to the test to enable the rating officer to make a determination, but it appears that he already possesses the essentials of a good supervisor. He has had some health problems in Mexico but in spite of these has not let up in any way in his work. Indeed, one wonders what he would be capable of if he were in perfect health given the high level of performance to date. It is a pleasure for the rating officer to go on record as stating that never in his 18 plus years with the organization has he had the pleasure of serving with a more promising young case officer.

It is recommended that he be promoted to GS-11 as soon as eligible. In addition to the period covered by this report (Oct 65-May 66) this employee served at the Mexico City Station in TDY status from April 65 to Aug. 65. His performance during this time was also taken under consideration in preparation of this report.

/s/ Robert T. Shaw

The reviewing officer concurs in the comments of the rater. I have observed this officer closely during his tour at the Station. He has largely overcome a tendency to freewheel somewhat and shows an increasing willingness to accept guidance from more experienced officers. Compared with other officers of the same grade at this Station, it is my belief that his overall performance should be rated O rather than S.

In the Station's view he is a young officer who should advance steadily and with more experience should be able to handle a demanding deep cover assignment.

Dispatch HMMT - 5685 dated 13 August 165 form DEGS Mexico City

"In view of the fact that Subject's recend survigin Nexico Station was done while he was on TDY, this Station is not in a position to prepare a fitness report covering Subject's performance for the period. Since he was absent from Headquarters, it is felt that he might possibly not be credited for his fine work unless the Station expresses its views."

"Subject plunged into work with the PERUMEN Section immediately upon arrival and was given a wide variety of assignments ranging from surveillances on a rainy street at 4:00 a.m. to the preparation of operational reviews. He was given a number of existing agent assets to handle with a minimum of overlap with the previous case officer. He performed very well in every instance. He is able, enthusiastic, and capable of carrying a large work load. His colleagues in the office and his agents and contacts outside found him a pleasure to work with. The only weakness noted during his TDY assignment was in his written work--a tendency to be unclear -- but this is something the Station is certain he can work out satisfactorily and it is not a cerious shortcoming."

SECTION C

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Significant strengths and weaknesses and their relationship to overall performance in the Operations Course. This section amplifies and explains, as necessary, the rating letters given above.

Mr. Piccolo's performance throughout the course seldom deviated from the "Proficient" level. His strongest showings were frequently in areas where he used knowledge gained from previous Agency experience together with his natural ability to get along with people in face-to-face situations. Ho excelled in agent handling because he made an extra effort to establish and maintain rapport, was competent in solving operational administration and support matters with a minimum of guidance, and was imaginative in devising cover and in establishing clandestine communications. Shortcomings, however, arose in other areas because he occasionally relied too much on his ability to improvise, rather than to spend extra time in analyzing, planning and otherwise preparing for agent meetings.

Mr. Piccolo easily recognized leads of operational or intelligence value, and as the course progressed, displayed marked improvement in his writing of cables, dispatches and reports.

Mr. Piccolo acquired a more than satisfactory knowledge of the principles and techniques taught during the course.

During his training, Mr. Piccolo has acquired a good knowledge of the principles and techniques of clandestine operations. He has demonstrated a good intelligence sense and a particular ability for handling agents.

He has had no supervisory responsibilities yet, and he appears to be cost-conscious as far as the undersigned can judge.

## OVER-ALL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The RATING LETTER reflects the over-all performance of the student in the course and is thus a measure of the extent to which the student possesses the skills and techniques required in the production of finished intelligence. The rating is not necessarily arrived at by mathematically averaging the in skills ratings, but takes into consideration any outstanding strengths or weaknesses that should be reflected in an evaluation of the performance of the student as a whole. The RATING LETTER is a consensus of the view of the faculty.

# FOREIGN LANGUAGE APTITUDE AND EXPERIENCE REPORT

The category checked below is an interpretation of the scores made by the person named above on a battery of foreign language aptitude tests. The relationships between test performance and subsequent training performance of trainees in Agency language training courses are indicated by the graphs next to the aptitude categories. The graphs to the left are for women and the graphs to the right are for men. From these graphs you can read for each aptitude category the probability that a person in that category will perform in an Agency foreign language training course at an average or better-than-average level. For example, 22 percent of the women who obtain an aptitude rating of "8" can be expected to be average or better in course performance, while 5 percent of the men with ratings of "8" can be expected to be average or better in course performance. A man needs an aptitude rating of "6" to have about the same expectation of success in language training as a woman with a rating of "8." At the other end of the scale, 80 percent of either men or women who obtain aptitude ratings of "2" can be expected to do average or better-than-average work in training. The differences in relationship are due to differences between men and women in both training performance and test scores. On the average women are somewhat higher on both.

Since many things other than aptitudes enter into the determination of training course performance, in any class of students there will usually be some whose performance will be better than would be expected from their test scores, just as there will likely be some whose performance is poorer than expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION, PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, and other factors should be considered in selecting people for language training and in interpreting language training results. For example, the number of languages previously studied or learned and the amount of academic and nonacademic language-learning experience are factors not measured by the tests but are indicative of probable success in learning a foreign language. Whether such experience was in the same language as the one to be studied or in a different one is, of course, an additional relevant factor.

SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

One of Mr. Piccolo's outstanding characteristics is his desire to improve himself. This is evidenced by both his continued educational program on the outside and by his successful effort to learn everything possible about his job. He also wants very much to obtain further career training within the DDP area, particularly in the FI field. I believe he has a definite potential for such work and that he should be given an opportunity for appropriate operational training as soon as possible.

His performance while under my supervision has consistently been well above that to be expected of an employee in his present grade, and I strongly recommend that he be promoted at once to GS-8. He has more than earned it.

SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential full development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

During the rating period Mr. Piccolo has been performing tasks that are normally assigned to personnel who hold a minimum GS rating of FIS-9. Without exception he has performed each of his assignments expeditiously and thoroughly. In addition to his normal administrative functions Mr. Piccolo has been acting as a case officer on certain sensitive and complicated clandestine operations. He has performed these duties in a superior fashion. It is my unqualified opinion that Mr. Piccolo should receive at least a two-grade promotion immediately. However it is recognized that this is contrary to current Agency policy and therefore it is strongly recommended that he be promoted to the grade of GS-7 immediately. Mr. Piccolo is intelligent and extremely industrious. He has worked long hours performing a variety of important tasks. It is my opinion that Mr. Piccolo has the attributes required of career personnel working in the Foreign Intelligence area and that he should be permitted to have his career designation changed to F1. Mr. Piccolo should also be given the opportunity to receive Agency training so that he might be better qualified to perform tasks in this area of activity. There is no question that he would become a professional case officer. The Section C rating has been given after careful consideration of the rated individual's grade and grade level performance.

## NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Since the previous Fitness Report, employee has been designated as the alternate to the Station's Records Officer. During periods when the Records Officer has been on duty elsewhere, this employee has assumed responsibility for the Station's records establishment and performed his duties in a competent manner. Based on these considerations, the ratings contained in Sections B, C, and D were determined. (Note Section D, items 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10.) Employee needs more experience in the following:

1.  The analysis of intelligence material for file categorization (note Section D, Item 4);

2.  Records Management techniques;

3.  More experience in the interpretation of data in memoranda preparation (note Section D, items 7 and 9).

His supervisor feels that considerable progress has been made on the points enumerated above, and as the employee gains experience, these weaknesses should reconcile themselves. His supervisor will continue to assign him duties designed to broaden his knowledge and effectiveness in records management. (Cont'd)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Joseph S. Piccolo

SUBJECT: Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category

REFERENCE: Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade

1.  Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties, and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed (subject to your signature below) in the functional category G for Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are contained in the Ivaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place- ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro- fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STUDY THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN CASE CAREFULLY.

2.  In general, you should consider the following:

a.  Categories are sharply defined. Competition is within categories, not between them. Thus, a weak B/06 performance is not strengthened by reclassifying it as B/O6.

b.  A change in category after sustained performance in a different category may cause a temporary loss of momentum in your career advancement until you have demonstrated proficiency in your new assignment.

c.  A category change should not be initiated for th period of a temporary, training or rotational assignment unless a permanent change of career track will follow.

3.  If you believe that this is not the correct category for you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi- mates another category or because you have made a permanent change of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of vour home base component, as appropriate, to a change of vour category. Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the Career Management Staff.

4.  Please sign and date this notification in the space provided and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to your Personnel Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LA Division

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo - Completion of Senior Operations Course #2/76

1. Mr. Piccolo attended the Senior Operations Course from 3 November to 12 December 1975 (SOC #2/76). Individual student grades and class rankings have not been used to evaluate student performance. The diverse background of the students and the nature of the course material used in the SOC preclude formal testing. This memorandum attests to Mr. Piccolo's satisfactory completion of the course.

2. During the six weeks of the course, 59% of the time was devoted to subjects and activities directly related to operations, including 30% devoted to "hands-on" time with technical equipment and "on-the-street" practice of tradecraft. 31% of the time was devoted to material broadly categorized as "ops management," including about 10% on the Soviet and China targets. The final 10% of the time was devoted to subjects categorized as "management overview and ops support," which consisted of meetings with DO division and staff chiefs and visits to labs and other ops support facilities in the Headquarters area. The ten officers in the class ranged in grade from GS-12 to GS-14 (average grade 12.9), average age was 43.6 (Mr. Piccolo's age is 40). The class members' average years of Agency service was 16.8, and their average years of overseas service was 9.2.

3. The six weeks, normally 30 days of instruction time, was shortened to 28 days by the Thanksgiving Day weekend. Of these 28 days, Mr. Piccolo spent six days in intensive training in Persuasion and Manipulation Skills as taught in the SAI system. He spent approximately another eight and one-half days on technical tradecraft (photo, audio, and commo equipment familiarization and usage) and street tradecraft (surveillance, car toss, dead drop, brush pass, etc.) including three days intensive practice of these skills in a live exercise conducted in Richmond. Another five days were spent at Headquarters meeting with the chiefs of all DO divisions and staffs, and visiting three operational support laboratories in the metropolitan area. The approximately eight and one-half remaining days were consumed by a combination of miscellaneous operations management subjects, student seminars, and term paper writing (though the latter was accomplished mostly on the students' own time). This running of the course was keynoted by remarks by the ADDO, and the Headquarters week was climaxed by an hour and a half with the DDO. The guest speaker at the graduation dinner of SOC #2/76 was Agency Historian Dr. Walter Pforzheimer.

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo - Completion of Senior Operations Course #2/76

4. Mr. Piccolo, as a 40-year-old GS-13/4, was at about the average age for this class and slightly above average in grade. Although formal grades are not given to graduates of the SOC, it was the consensus of DTS staff Instructors involved in SOC #2/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly rank number one in this particular group. Bringing to the class broad operational experience and understanding, Mr. Piccolo was an active participant in the six-day SAI block of. instruction and made contributions based on his own operational past. The tradecraft instructors who conducted the live problem in Richmond described Mr. Piccolo as the best student in street tradecraft. One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more than any of the others, the ability to lead the group." Mr. Piccolo's term paper on the subject of how a NOC station might be established in Rio de Janeiro was careful and thorough and was described by the panel as "an excellent overall plan." To a man of Mr. Piccolo's experience, at least some of the course may have seemed a little basic or redundant, but he never let it show, and always took part with the same enthusiasm as the more junior members of the class.

5. A copy of this memorandum is being placed in Mr. Piccolo's official personnel file.

I am interested in remaining in the managerial cone" and in obtaining a position that will give me increased responsibility as well as career growth through promotion. Based on my experience and performance as Acting Chief of Station Managua for two months in 1968, Deputy Chief of Base Rio de Janeiro for the last 10 months of my tour in 1972-73 and present assignment as Deputy Chief of Station Managua, I request assignment to a position which entails supervision of several employees and requires exercise of managerial skills and judgement. If assigned to another tour overseas, a position as Deputy Chief of Station in a medium to large size Station would be preferred. If assigned to Headquarters, I would like to work where an overview of the related operational and managerial activities can be experienced. If the above assignmentssare not available, a tour which would brraden my operational knowledge would be desired. ie: SL Division China Ops activity or OTS

7. IN CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE EMPLOYEE AND. HIS PREFERENCE FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT. INDICATE YOUR RECOMMENDATION FOR HIS NEXT ASSIGNMENT AND TRAINING:

Given his steady, reliable and productive performance, every effort should be made to accomodate his expressed preferences. There can be no doubt that by temperament and experience he would be of greater value to the Organization in the field rather than at Headquarters, but a tour at Headquarters does appear timely now, following the past 5 years in the field. I do not honestly know how he will perform in Staff work, being a Field Station activist, but the experience should have a further broadening effect upon him,

Dear Dick:

As you know, the President and Mrs. Johnson visited Managua, Nicaragua on Monday, July 8, 1968, upon their return from the San Salvador Conference.

Assistant to the Special Agent in Charge Ronald M. Pontius of the Presidential Protective Division, has informed me that Mr. *Joseph Piccolo* and Mr. Carl Jenkins were of particular assistance in establishing and coordinating the relations with the Nicaraguan security organizations, and President Somoza's staff. Mrs. Elizabeth Jenkin's assistance as an interpreter was also greatly appreciated.

Personally and on behalf of the United States Secret Service, I wish to extend my sincere appreciation and thanks to the above mentioned personnel for the capable and professional manner in which they performed their duties.

Sincerely,

James J. Rowley

    DESCRIBE BRIEFLY THE TYPE OF WORK YOU WOULD PREFER FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT IF DIFFERENT FROM THAT INDICATED
    IN ITEM NO. ABOVE. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PREFERENCE, INDICATE YOUR CHOICE.

To date, I have worked in operational activities of primarily CI and FI orientation with a greater emphasis on the former. In order to round out my early career stage as an operations officer, an assignment with more CA orientation would be beneficial.

If available, my grade not withstanding, an assignment as supervisor of a section or as Chief of Base would be desirable in preparation for the eventual assumption of duties with higher responsibility in the future.

12. IN CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE EMPLOYEE AND HIS PREFERENCE FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT, INDICATE YOUR RECOMMENDATION FOR HIS NEXT ASSIGNMENT AND TRAININGI

It is recommended, primarily because of problems of health (at the high altitude in this post) that this officer be allowed one of the doices he has listed under 11 B. The departure of this officer will mean a loss to the operational capacity of his Section; and it is with regret that Chief of Station, Mexico City concurs with his request for re-assignment,

Action for Integration of Mr. Joseph Piccolo

Effective August 27, 1965

The purpose of this memorandum is to call your attention to existing policies which are particularly material to you while you are integrated and to set forth certain rights and obligations which are incident to your status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:

1. As an employee of this organization, at the present grade and salary of as-10 & $8170 per annum, you vill accept cover employment with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred to as "your cover facility") effective as of August 27 1965.

Your appointment to your cover facility is being effected at RSR.7 and salary of $7245 per annum. You are prohibited, except as specifically authorized herein, from retaining emoluments paid by your cover facility.

2. It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour consists of a period of Two Years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this ormnization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty, you vill be required to reimburse the Government for all of its expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your depenients, from the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent with your cover designation, will normally be at the direction of your cover facility. Such travel will be accomplished in conformance with applicable regulations of your cover facility except when you are directed for operational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations of this organization.

4. Salary and (except as provided in paragraph three (3) above) allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the extent that they are less than or equal to the salary and allowance paymenta due on the basis of your grade level with this organization. If such cover payments are less than the shount due, the difference will be credited to your payroll. account with this organization. If such cover payments exceed the amount due, the overage will be remitted to this organization at designated intervals, presently
   Computations hereunder will be made on the basis of the aggregate gross due and received provided, however, that in computing remittances for overage Federal and, if applicable, District of Columbia income taxes withheld by your cover facility against the overage may be deducted. To assure timely accuracy in your payroll account with this organization you are expected to immediately report cover facility payroll changes.

5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however, to preserve the security of your cover position.

a. Upon integration into your cover facility, you will continue to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended, and at your personal expense you will be subject to payroll deductions for retirement purposes (now six and one-half per cent) on the basis of your cover salary or your salary from this organization, whichever is the greater.

b. If you receive taxable income from both your cover facility and this organization, necessary adjustments for Federal, and if applicable, District of Columbia income tax purposes will be made in conformance with instructions received from this organization.

c. Consistent with your cover activity, you will continue to be responsible for compliance with the rules and regulations of this organization.

d. You are not assured upon the completion of your period of duty with your cover facility of any status with your cover based on your services performed with that organization at the request of this organization.

# NOTICE OF CONVERSION PRIVILEGE
Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act of 1954

An employee is entitled to convert to an individual policy when his group insurance terminates because of separation from an agency, transfer or appointment to a group excluded by law or regulation from insurance coverage, expiration of 12 continuous months in a nonpay status, or entry into the military service of the United States and acquisition of coverage under the Servicemen's Indemnity Act of 1951.

An employee whose group insurance terminates as indicated above may, under provisions set forth in his Certificate of Group Insurance, purchase an individual policy of life insurance without medical examination. The individual policy may be in an amount not exceeding the employee's group life insurance and will be issued at rates applicable to the type of policy purchased and to his current age and class of risk.

If you are entitled to convert group life insurance to an individual policy and wish to exercise this privilege, you must:

1.  Ask the agency identified in the block below to give you a completed Agency Certification of Insurance Status, and

2.  Follow the instructions printed on the Agency Certification of Insurance Status, and mail it to the Office of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance, 330 Fourth Avenue, New York 10, N. Y. That office will promptly mail to you detailed information on how to apply for conversion.

IMPORTANT

THE TIME IN WHICH AN EMPLOYEE MAY CONVERT IS LIMITED. THE COMPLETED "AGENCY CERTIFICATION OF INSURANCE STATUS" (NOT THIS FORM) MUST BE MAILED TO THE OFFICE OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE WITHIN 31 DAYS AFTER YOUR GROUP INSURANCE TERMINATES, OR WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS NOTICE, WHICHEVER BASIS GIVES YOU THE MOST TIME.

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, LIFE INSURANCE IS PAYABLE IF DEATH OCCURS WITHIN 31 DAYS AFTER AN EMPLOYEE'S GROUP INSURANCE TERMINATES, EVEN THOUGH HE HAS NOT APPLIED FOR CONVERSION. IF DEATH OCCURS WITHIN THIS PERIOD FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING POSSIBLE BENEFITS MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE AGENCY NAMED BELOW.

Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo.

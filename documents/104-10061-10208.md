Attention: Susan Watkins

COMMENTS (Number each comment to show from whom to whom. Draw a line across column after each comment.

Per our telecon yesterday, I am returning the list of names you provided me for checking. I am only concerned about the protection of Howard Hao-Sheng Chao. He is a current asset of the FR Base, New York. I would appreciate it if in the course of sanitizing any of the other names listed on the attached routing slip, you would delete Howard's as well. Many thanks.

Bob Baker

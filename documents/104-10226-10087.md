THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WAS FOR THE THREE GROUPS TO PLAN A STAGE OF ACTIVE WARFARE. THE UR WAS ADVISED BY THE FRENCH EMBASSY NOT TO PARTICIPATE, BUT THE UR COULD NOT CONVINCE THE DRE AND THE MRP TO REVERSE THEIR DECISION FOR AN UPRISING SCHEDULED FOR THE LAST DAYS OF AUGUST, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A GENERAL UPRISING OF ALL INTERNAL RESISTANCE GROUPS.

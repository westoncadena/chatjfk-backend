Subject: Current Address of Maurice Halperin

OOA(S) 3,246933
WSYRO-8060
27 December 1962
Preston & Jamea
342 Huntington B Grouse Wal
Syracuse University.

1.  A source of this office has just advised us that he received a Christmas card (1962) from Maurice Halperin on which the return address was given as: "Apt C-2, Calle 12, no 103, Miramar, Habana, Cuba." The only message on the card was one of Christmas greetings. Halperin and our source have known each other for a number of years and they always exchange Christmas cards. This is the first one Halperin has sent with a Cuban address on it. The last time that our source saw Halperin vas in Moscow when he (the former) vas visiting in the USSR during August- September 1961 as part of an official US delegation.

2.  In view of Halperin's past activities and associations, we are making this information known to you. Our source comments that Helperin always seems to show up wherever there is some sort of activity going on

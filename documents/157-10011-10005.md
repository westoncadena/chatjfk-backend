Desmond FITZGERALD, Chief of SAS, met with AMLASH, using Nestor SANCHEZ as interpreter. (88-89). The cover of the "contact plan for the meeting, a copy of which is in the AMLASH file," (89) read as follows:

OCCURRENCE: (CARD 2)
In a memorandum by SANCHEZ on November 13, 1963, it was reported that "FITZGERALD informed [AMLASH] that the U.S. is prepared to render all necessary assistance to any anti-Communist Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban leadership." (89) Despite the fact that SANCHEZ reported that "nothing of an operational nature was discussed at the FITZGERALD meeting" (90), FITZGERALD recalled that AMLASH-1 "spoke_repeatedly_of_the_need-for-an-assassination-weapon. In-particular, he wanted a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon that could be used to kill Castro from a distance." (90) FITZGERALD said that he told AMLASH "that the U.S. Government would have no part of an attempt on CASTRO's life. (90) However, the SANCHEZ memorandum reported "After the meeting AMLASH stated that he was satisfied with the policy discussion but now desired to know what technical support we could provide him."(90)

Desmond FITZGERALD, Chief of SAS, met with AMLASH, using Nestor SANCHEZ as interpreter. (88-89). The cover of the "contact plan for the meeting, a copy of which is in the AMLASH file," (89) read as follows:

Card 2 of 2

OCCURRENCE: (CARD 2)

In a memorandum by SANCHEZ on November 13, 1963, it was reported that "FITZGERALD informed AMLASH that the U.S. is prepared to render all necessary assistance to any anti-Communist Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban leadership." (89) Despite the fact that SANCHEZ reported that "nothing of an operational nature was discussed at the FITZGERALD meeting" (90), FITZGERALD recalled that AMLASH-1 "spoke_repeatedly_of_the_need_for_an_assassination weapon. In particular, he wanted a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon that could be used to kill Castro from a distance." (90) FITZGERALD said that he told AMLASH "that the U.S. Government would have no part of an attempt on CASTRO's life. (90) However, the SANCHEZ memorandum reported "After the meeting AMLASH stated that he was satisfied with the policy discussion but now asked to know what technical support we could provide him."(90)

OCCURRENCE:
WAINWRIGHT met with TEPEDINO, who reported to him AMLASH's reaction to his meeting with FITZGERALD. TEPEDINO said that AMLASH dwelt constantly on the fact that "he could not understand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised a final solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the US Government gave much equipment and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban coastal targets. According to TEPEDINO (AMLASH) feels strongly on this point, and if he does not get advice and materials from a U.S. Government technician, he will probably become_fed_up_ again, and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date."(91)

SANCHEZ stated "that he received an OPIM cable from FITZGERALD that night or early the next morning telling him that everything was off." (94) But, the IG REPORT authors did not find such a cable in the AMLASH file. (94)

Special Group (Augmented)


*Mongoose*

SGA discussed various possibilities of accomplishing reconnaissance of Cuba, ranging from
very low level coverage by tactical aircraft to high performance aircraft and drones. Over-
flights and peripheral flights were discussed.

It was agreed that the first priority is one high performance mission in the western part of the island, to be accompanied by all out Elint support. Depending on the results of this, a number of similar searches may be mounted. First mission was later approved by higher authority, but the decision on the second proposition left open.

The entire package was to be discussed at the USIB, and by Chiefs on Wednesday, October 10th.

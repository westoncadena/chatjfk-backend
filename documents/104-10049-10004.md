SUBJECT: Call from Jon French of DCD Concerning Frank
STURGIS

1. The following information was provided to Jon French
   by his DCD Miami office on 23 August. The information was
   given to the DCD Miami office by a contact (not identified)
   on 23 August who obtained it from Oscar FREELY. FREELY is
   writing a book on Frank STURGIS.

2. STURGIS is to appear on the Tomorrow Show at 2 a.m.
   on 24 August, which is to be narrated by Tom Schneider.
   STURGIS just recently returned to Miami from taping the show
   in New York.

3. While in New York STURGIS saw Marita LORENZ and
   obtained from her a book which, according to source, appeared
   to be cryptographic material and seemed to relate to Albania.
   The DCD source saw a "few copies" of what he described as
   "mathematical matrix" material.

4. STURGIS currently (today - 23 August) is attempting
   to contact Senator Baker to turn over the material to him.
   DCD plans to ask the source to monitor the situation and advise
   whether the material in fact is turned over to Baker.

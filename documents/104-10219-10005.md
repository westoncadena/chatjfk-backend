1. RAYMOND H. GERENDE (IDENTITY A) WAS RECRUITED IN MARCH 1955 AS A MEMBER OF A STATION UNILATERAL SURVEILLANCE TEAM. GERENDE RECEIVED AN OPERATIONAL APPROVAL ON 28 FEB 55 AND ON 1 OCT 55 WAS CONVERTED TO CONTRACT STATUS WITH AN INITIAL ANNUAL SALARY OF $3600. BY LATE 1956 HE HAD BECOME THE P/A IN CHARGE OF THE SURVEILLANCE TEAM AND ADDITIONALLY WAS IN CHARGE OF PHOTO SURVEILLANCE OF THE SOVIET MISSION, INCLUDING PROCESSING THE FILM. AT THIS TIME HE WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING "CONSCIENTIOUS, LOYAL, HARDWORKING AND DEDICATED." IN 1957 HE WAS GIVEN FIVE WEEKS OF CLANDESTINE OPS TRAINING IN THE HQS-AREA, BEING DESCRIBED BY HIS TRAINER AS MORE "PRO-AMERICAN THAN MEXICAN," IN LATE 1958 HE WAS DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE STATION'S "MOST VALUABLE ASSETS," ETC.

2. ON 12 DEC 58 GERENDE MARRIED LIEMPTY-19 (IDENTITY B), WHO ASSISTED HIM DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS A PART-TIME SUPPORT ASSET. IN GENERAL GERENDE APPEARS TO HAVE PERFORMED A CREDITABLE JOB AS THE P/A FOR THE KDFACTOR ACTIVITY, WHICH PROVIDED SURVEILLANCE AND PHOTO COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET TARGET. AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION, HIS CONTRACT AGENT SALARY HAD INCREASED TO $7000 PER ANNUM. SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEPT FOR GIVING ENGLISH LESSONS AND OTHER MINOR COVER ACTIVITIES, GERENDE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A FULL-TIME RTACTION EMPLOYEE. HE PERFORMED A NUMBER OF TASKS IN ADDITION TO KDFACTOR, INCLUDING SERVING AS LP KEEPER AND TRANSCRIBER/TRANSLATOR OF AN AUDIO OPERATION, INVOLVEMENT IN OPS AGAINST THE CUBAN MISSION AND CUBAN EXILE GROUPS, GENERAL OPS SUPPORT, AND SPOTTING AND ASSESSMENT. ON 8 OCT 1963, GERENDE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED AN SGSWIRL, ALTHOUGH IT EMERGED THAT HE HAD NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ALL FUNDS PASSED TO HIM (THE STATION DISMISSED THIS PROBLEM) AND FELT THAT HE WAS BEING UNDEREMPLOYED BY RTACTION. CONCERNING THE LATTER CHARGE, THE STATION SEEMS TO HAVE HAD PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE 1960'S KEEPING GERENDE FULLY OCCUPIED, SINCE FOR SECURITY REASONS THERE WAS RELUCTANCE TO INTRODUCE HIM TO ANY MORE OPERATIONS THAN THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER HE WAS ALREADY AWARE OF. (FYI: IN ADDITION TO HIS WIFE, GERENDE'S MOTHER, 201-0262488, AND TWO BROTHER-IN-LAWS (KDFACTOR-1) AND (KDADAGE-14) WERE ALSO STATION ASSETS.

3. IN 1969 GERENDE SEPARATED FROM LIEMPTY-19 IN WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE BEGINNING OF AN EXTREMELY ACRIMONIOUS DIVORCE PRO- CEEDING AND FIGHT FOR THE CUSTODY OF THEIR THREE CHILDREN. IN DECEMBER 1969 GERENDE WAS PUT ON HALF PAY AND HAD HIS OPS DUTIES SUSPENDED BY THE STATION BECAUSE OF HIS FULL-TIME INVOLVEMENT IN LEGAL MATTERS SURROUNDING THE DIVORCE. ON 26 JUNE 1970 GERENDE AND LIEMPTY-19 SIGNED QUIT CLAIMS AND SECRECY AGREEMENTS. GERENDE WAS PAID $10,000 AND LIEMPTY-19 $2500 AS TERMINATION BONUSES, AND THE PAYMENTS WERE MADE ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO THAT THE STATION WOULD HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THE TWO AND THEREBY KEEP THEIR RTACTION STATUS FROM EMERGING DURING THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS. ON 8 JULY 1970 LIEMPTY-19 UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED AT HOS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET A LARGER TERMINATION BONUS. SUBSEQUENTLY LIEMPTY-19 AND HER CHILDREN WENT TO RESIDE IN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, WHERE SHE WAS PAID THE REST OF HER TERMINATION BONUS VIA MONTHLY CHECKS SENT TO HER BROTHER IN THE HOS AREA. SHE WAS LAST REPORTED TO BE WORKING AS A SECRETARY AT THE U.S. MISSION IN THE HAGUE.

4. ACCORDING TO MEXICO CITY 19452, 10 APRIL 72, THE LAST STATION CONTACT WITH GERENDE WAS IN MAY 1971, WHEN HE RECEIVED THE FINAL INSTALLMENT OF TERMINATION BONUS, CABLE NOTED THAT GERENDE APPEARED FINANCIALLY PRESSED, BUT NAS GIVING DAILY ENGLISH CLASSES AND RENTING HIS HOUSE TO STATION STAFFER JESSE R. GARDALPHE. THERE CHAS NO INDICATION THAT EITHER GERENDE OR HIS WIFE HAD VIOLATED THEIR SECRECY AGREEMENTS. STATEMENT WAS MADE THAT HE NO LONGER APPEARED TO BE DRINKING EXCESSIVELY.

5. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT GERENDE'S AGENT SERVICE RECORD QUALIFIES RECOMENDATION FOR HIS REUSE BY SAYING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT INCOME TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FULL- TIME RTACTION EMPLOYMENT, AND HAVE RESOLVED HIS PERSONAL PROBLEMS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EXCEPT FOR A POSSIBLE ROLE IN SERVICING SPECIFIC OPS SUPPORT TASKS, GERENDE OFFERS LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATION. SUGGEST THAT THE STATION MAY WISH TO DISCUSS GERENDE WITH THEODORE G. KINDOPP (P) UPON HIS ARRIVAL, SINCE GERENDE WAS HIS LANDLORD DURING PREVIOUS STAY IN MEXICO.

1. GERENDE/LIEMPTY/19 BOTH WERE TERMINATED MAINLY BECAUSE OF INSOLUBLE MARITAL DIFFICULTIES, AND JKLANCE HAS LESS WARRANT OR DESIRE THAN EVER TO INTERFERE IN ANY WAY. WE SPECIFICALLY DESIRE HOLD STATION INVOLVEMENT, EITHER MEXICO CITY OR THE HAGUE, TO ABSOLUTE MINIMUM, AND CERTAINLY DO NOT WISH INVOLVE DUTCH.

2. GERENDE SHOULD NOT RPT NOT HAVE ANY HAGUE STATION CONTACT FURNISHED. FILE SHOWS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT LIEMPTY/19 NOT SO COMPLETELY UNSTABLE THAT SHE WOULD CREATE SCANDAL. PRINCIPAL-REASON WE INSISTED PAYING HER TERMINATION BONUS OVER PERIOD OF TIME WAS TO RETAIN SOME SEMBLANCE OF CONTROL IN SITUATION SUCH AS THIS. BOTH SHE AND GERENDE SIGNED TERMINATION AND SECRECY AGREEMENTS, AND WE INTEND TRY HOLD THEM BOTH TO THEIR COMMITMENTS.

3. RECOMMEND STATION AVOID GIVING ANY INDICATION OF TAKING SIDES. WHILE THESE MARITAL DIFFICULTIES DEPLORABLE, THEY ARE PURELY PERSONAL AFFAIR NOW AND BEST HANDLED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE ATTORNEYS. HQS SUGGESTS THAT HINT OF STRONG TONE TAKEN WITH GERENDE NOW MIGHT SAVE

Dear Mr. Roos,

As you may be aware, your sister, Hestor Roos de Alvarez was associated with this Agency in Mexico City for a number of years, and due to personal problems with her husband, her services (and those of her husband ) with this Agency were formally terminated on 26 June 1970. In the termination agreement, this Agency agreed to pay Mrs. Hestor Roos de Alvarez a bonus payment amounting to $2500 payable in ten monthly installments of $250 beginning 31 July 1970. Since Mrs. Roos departed Mexico City in July 1970 and came to the U.S., she could not be contacted in Mexico City to receive these payments. While in the U.S., Hrs. Roos de Alvarez contacted our Agency on 8 July 1970 and requested ve pay her the funds here; and while her request was being considered she departed the U.S. for Mexico, and later went to The Hague where she is residing at Ary Schefferstratt 47, The Hague, Netherlands. Mrs. Roos de Alvarez has written to this Agency from the Hague requesting we for- ward the payments to her via international mail. If you concur, this Agency would perfer to forward these pay- ments to you directly, and request that you forward them to your sister via the international mails. The initial check for $750 covers payments for the months of July. August, and September 1970; and hereafter, we will for- ward to you monthly a check (from October 1970 through April 1971) in the amount of $350 in your sister's nane so that you can forward them on to her every month. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter and request that these payments not be discussed with anyone except your sister, Mrs. Hestor Roos de Alvarez, since the саве is considered to be a sensitive matter by the United States Government.

17 July 1970

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : Raymond H. GERENDE (P) and Wife.

1.  Raymond H. GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and contract agent who has been employed by the Agency in Mexico City since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, during which time he has served this Agency well. During the past fifteen years GERENDE has been generally engaged in the area of operational support activities in Mexico City. For the past two years he served as a principal agent handler for a sensitive fixed surveillance project, LIEMPTY; was used in unilateral recruitment approaches against the Cubar target; and in special support investigations. Mrs. GERENDE, who is LIEMPTY/19, has been employed off and on since 1958 as a support asset, (transcriber/translator) under MOC, and during the past two years has worked intermittently transcribing unilateral telephone tap tapes.

2.  During the past year GERENDE and his wife have had serious marital problems which culminated in a separation in November 1969, and divorce actions sere initiated by both parties. The divorce proceedings are still in the courts, and bitter disputes have resulted between both parties concerning custody of the children, division of personal property, and the monetary settlements. The above problem is compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in some considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behalf of the Agency and if she exposed him, it could lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and possible compromise of operations LIEMPTY, LIMESA, LIEMBRACE, and LIFEAT, as well as numerous individual Station assets such as LISTERINE, LIRAZOR/1, LIBAND/1, and David M. WILSTED (P). Since late 1969, Mexico City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his wife on this problem, and every effort has been made by the Station to have

File: GERENDE (P)

- 2 -

both parties settle the divorce amicably and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the projects. Because of the above family problems which threatened GERENDE's personal cover and security, he was relieved of all operational responsibilities and placed on half salary in December 1969.

3. In March of 1970, Mexico City Station decided that GERENDE's personal problems were not being resolved, and because of the continuing security threat, plans were made to terminate both GERENDE and his wife by the end of FY 1970. The LIEMPTY Project renewal, approved in May 1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for GERENDE of $10,000 for 15 years of service with the Agency, and in addition approval was received to pay Mrs. GERENDE the sum of $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her from revealing her husband's 'cency affiliation and what she knows about Agency operations in Mexico. This project approval carried the ADDI caveat that the ter- mination bonuses to both GERENDE and his wife be paid on a monthly basis rather than in one lump sum as a security measure to assure at least an element of control over both individuals, since the continued receipt of these monthly payments depended on their loyalty to the Agency. GERYNDE and his wife were terminated by Station represen- tatives in Mexico on 26 June 1970 under standard Agency procedures, and separate Quit Claims and Secrecy Agrce- monte were sinned by both GERENDE and his wife. Neither GERENDE nor his wife had any objection to the wording of the Quit Claims or the Security agreements, and both appeared to be satisfied with the terms of the settlement, and with the fairness of the Agency's position.

4. On 8 July 1970 at 1115 hours, Mrs. GERENDE appeared at the main gate of the Headquarter's building, and requested to see an official from the Chiw of Security. During the subsequent interview, Mrs. GERENDE established her identity, and supplied the interviewer with details on her and her husband's past employment with the Agency in Mexico City and the fact that they had terminated said employment in late June 1970. Mrs. GERENDE made three specific requests of the Agency:

- 3 -

"A. That she be released from the stipulation in her secrecy agreemont which prohibits her from revealing her or her husband's affiliation with the Agency, in order that she may substantiate her husband's salary to be awarded support payment from her husband.

"B. If her first request cannot be fullfilled, that she be awarded a higher amount of support from the..NCE. Agency.

"C. If neither of the above two can be fullfilled, that she be sent the Agency check (in present amount) either at the address mentioned above or in care of the Embassy of the Netherlands in Mexico City, which is accepting mail for her."

In addition to the above, Mrs. GERENDE stated she feels she must permanently leave Mexico City because of threats made on her life by her husband, and that she cannot meet her Agency Econtact in Mexico City as specified in hor tormination, to receive the monthly payments from him. Mrs. GERENDE has been given the phone number of the Agency Secur Duty Officer and her local phone number and address, where she is temporarily residing, was obtained. She was advised she would be contacted within the near future with an answer to her requests.

5. Upon receipt of the above information, Mexico City Station was notified by cable of the situation and their. comments were requested. The Station, on 10 July, recom- mended that Headquarters hold Mrs. GERENDE to her секресу agreement, not grant her any increase beyond the amount agreed upon in her termination, and proposed that she be givon her termination payment in one lump sum or that checks be mailed to her monthly.

6. Headquarters, in agreement with the Station's position on the case, attempted to telephone her without success on 13 July 1970. That sane afternoon at 1400 hours, Mrs. GERENDE's brother, a naturalized U.S. citizen who resides in Alexandria, Virginia, and works at Fort Belvoir, called the Offic of Security, using the number supplied to Mrs. GERENDE, and informed the security official that since Mrs. GERENDE had not received any response, she expects to hear from JKLANCE by letter in care of the Netherlands Enbassy, Mexico City.

7. Jn 14 July , headquarters cabled Hexico City Station advising then of the above development, and requested they contact Mrs. GERENDE and inform her of the following Headquarters answers to her requests (as outlined in paragraph 4 above):

A. We cannot release her from her from her security agreement.

B. We cannot consider awarding her additional financail benefits beyond the amount stated in the termination agreement, which she accepted.

C. We are willing to forward checks to her by mail, but request an address other than the Netherlands Embassy.

8. Headquarters has also requested that Mexico City Station keep Headquarters advised of developments in the ease of Mrs. GERENDE.

TIME 1330 Hours

NAME Hester Roos de Alverez GRADE N/A OFFICE N/A

Temp. 4744 Kenzore Avenue

Add. Alexandria, Virginia

INCIDENT Request for Assistance TIME 1115 PLACE Headquarters

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION: SUBJECT came to the Main entrance of the Headquarters building and asked the guard on duty to place her in touch with someone from the Office of Security. The undersigned responded to the Main entrance and escorted SUBJECT to the Main Feception area where she was interviewed. After displaying some reluctance to speak openly, SUBJECT related that she had been employed on a contract basis by the Agency at the Embassy in Mexico City. She gave in way of biographic data that she is the daughter of a former Dutch embassy official statione in Washington, that she was employed at the Dutch embassy in Mexico City, and it was there that she met her presently estranged husband Ramon Alverez, who at the time of their meeting was employed also on a contract basis with the Agency. She states that both she and her husband renounced their former citizenships to become citizens of Mexico. After her marriage to Alverez she gained employ with the Agency and stated that her specific duties included but were not restricted to the Emonitoring and translation of tapes. SUBJECT stated that her husband was terminated from Agency employment for Security reasons within the past year, and received at the time of his termination, six months salary and the promise of $1000.00 per month for 10 months. She stated that inasmuch as she is in the process of filing for divorce from her husband, and could not substantiate her husband's salary in a court of law because of the termination agreement she has signed, the Agency has agreed to and is paying her the sum of $250.00 per month which she is using to support her four children of whom she has been awarded custody. She stated that she Jis presently employed as a school teacher, but feels that she cannot provide ample support to her children on her salary and the allowance furnished by the Agency.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION: SUBJECT made three specific requests of the Agency:

A) That she be released from the stipulation in her secrecy agreement which prohibits her from revealing her or her husband's affiliation with the Agency, in order that she may substantiate her husband's salary to be awarded support payment from her husband.

B) If her first request cannot be fullfilled, that she be awarded a higher amount of support from the Agency...

C) If neither of the above two can be fullfilled, that she be sent the Agency check (in present amount) either at the address mentioned above or in care of the embassy of The Netherlands in Mexico City, which is accepting mail for her. She stated she feels she must permanently leave Mexico City because of threats made on her life by her husband, and cannot meet Victor Bellini (allegedly Agency contact) at the specified restaurant location on a monthly basis to receive her check, as is the present requirement.

SUBJECT reiterated her statement that she cannot stay in Mexico City because of her husband's activities directed against the welfare of both herself and her children. By way of reference, SUBJECT mentioned the names of Victor Bellini, Bill Mills, and Don Vogel; all of whom are allegedly Agency personnel in Mexico City.

SUBJECT was advised that the undersigned could not make a decision on any of her requests but that a report of the interview would be made and forwarded to (Continued....)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: GERENDE's Wife's Visit to Washington

1. On 6 July 1970, Mr. Walt Raymond of the CA Staff advised that GERENDE's wife was in Washington and had been in touch with him. Apparently Mr. Ramond and GERENDE's wife had been acquainted for some time in the past. Neither admits that Mr. Raymond is an Agency employee. GERENDE's wife advised that she wanted to get in touch with someone in Agency Headquarters. Mr. Raymond advised her he would contact his liaison people to see what could be done.

2. DIRECTOR 048632 was sent to the Station outlining this and requesting Station's advice as to whether a Headquarters representative should meet with GERENDE's wife. MEXICO CITY 3612 (IN 117477) outlined details of the termination of GERENDE and his wife and recommended against seeing her.

3, I discussed this matter briefly with Mr. John Green, Legal Counsel's Office, who felt even if Station should recommend seeing GERENDE and his wife, that it would be limited to WH Division representation. On 7 July I advised Mr. Raymond of the Station's answer as contained in MEXICO CITY 3612. He said he would contact GERENDE's wife approximately 8:30 of the evening of 7 July, and tell her that his liaison contact had been unable to find anyone who would see her. Mr. Raymond was uncertain as to what GERENDE's wife might do.

Pseudonym:
Raymond H. GERENDE

Project: LIEMPTY

Agent Recruited by: Matthew S. DINGLEY Date: 18 March 1955

Capacity in Which Agent Served: LIEMPTY Project principal agent, formerly member of surveillance team, also LIFEAT basehouse keeper.

Rate of Pay: $7,000.00 (USD) per annum

Other Commitments: Termination payment equal to one month's salary for each full year of service after 18 March 1955.

Agent Dismissed by: Vincent P. RIZZUTO Date: 30 June 1970

Reason for Dismissal: Subject became involved in a bitter divorce action with his wife (LIEMPTY-19). The protracted legal battle forced the Station to suspend GERENDE from operational activity for six months for security reasons. When it became evident that no early solution was in sight, termination had to be effected.

See attached sheet

Is the Agent Recommended for Reuse: Yes, assuming that his earlier service has not been exposed, that his marital problems have been resolved, and that he has sufficient outside employment income to obviate the need for full-time employment by JKLANCE.

Manner of Dismissal: Amicable. GERENDE expressed thanks for the generous settlement and swore to preserve security.

Letter of Termination Signed: Yes.

Cost of Termination: $10,000.00 (USD), payable in ten monthly installments.

Paragraph 9 of Agent Service Record:

Security Risks: GERENDE has known a number of Station officers in true name, although with the PCS departure of RIZZUTO the last of these will have left Mexico. (GERENDE's remaining contact will be Bruce H. FERNALD, whom he knows in alias.) GERENDE knows all agents currently associated with the LIEMPTY operation, as well as LIEMPTY-10 and -11, currently working with the LIEMBRACE team. He also knowa LIEMBRACE-1, -2, and -4, and is, of course, aware of the objectives and methods of the LIEMPTY and LIEMBRACE operations. He knows that the Station has access to the entire LIMESA complex, although he does not know of the LIMUST operation. GERENDE knows the true names and JKLANCE status of Oliver G. SCANTLING, David N. WILSTED, and Raymond L. BARCENAS. He knows of the LIFEAT operation through his own former activities as well as those of his nother (LIFEUD-19) and his wife (LIEMPTY-19). The husbands of his two sisters work for the Station. One is LIEMPTY-4, who was handled by GERENDE, and the other is LIBAND-1, whose activity is not supposed to be known to GERENDE. In past years GERENDE was exposed to almost all phases of Station support activity. In recent years he has been more compartmented. GERENDE received five weeks of Headquarters covert training in 1957.

LIEMPTY Progress Report 1 November 1969 - 25 March 1970

Reference: HMMA-38119, 18 November 1969

PRIORITY

## SUMMARY

1.  The LIEMPTY Project has thus far survived the absence from duty of its principal agent, Raymond H. GERIDE, as well as the threat to the security of the Project represented by GERENDE'S marital problems. Bruce H. FERNALD has been handling all Project personnel sinco carly December 1969, when GLENDE was deactivated and placed on half-pay. No problems have resulted from this, other than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GERENDE was). The security threat will remain as long as GERENDE's estranged-wife has it within her power to expose GERENDE'S RVROCK connection and the type of work he was engaged in. She has continually promiscd not to do this, and thus far she has kept her word.

2.  The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the Station. It continues to play an important CI role (particularly for LINERGO and LREAD) but its greatest value, as far as the Station is concerned, is in the positive field. Two recent examples underline this: The early (and thus far only) debriefing of AEMIDRIFF was accomplished almost exclusively by showing hor photos of all HARSH Badassy personnel and getting from her a character skotch on each individual. These photos were all obtained by LILYRIC and LICALLA. Secondly, LIEPTY observations (as opposed to

photos) played an important role in our total coverage of AESTASICK during the recent operational activity undertaken against AESZASICK. In short, LIEPTY remains a highly effective and highly useful support asset, whose product is obtained in order to be used operationally, not simply collected for the files.

GEREDE

3. The GEREIDE problem is unquestionably a serious one. We are forwarding under separate cover copies of several memoranda prepared by GERENDE. Ono outlines the history of his marital problems, another describes the current legal situation, and a third outlines proposals for a settlement. There is no hope of reconciliation. The Station's position with GERENDE from the start has been that he must agree to an amicable acttlement with his wife in order to insure that she would not feel forced to take steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations. For this reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, and that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that salary. GERENDE's wire was made aware of our position on this, and she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement was strictly informal. The Station felt that GERENDE could not be allowed to uso his RVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his wife, because if he did, she could hardly be expected to refrain from exposing his connections. Indeed, events have shown that GERENDE's wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear to her that she, as well as GEREIDE, would lose money if he loses his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely out of the picture. Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station position was fair, and he said he would conform.

4. The attached memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's opinion, basically fair accounts. In the beginning, the Station was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of the doubt, largely because her description of GERENDE's character weaknesses came as no surprise (particularly his tendency to procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake). Early in the conflict, LIEMPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what she could tell her lawyer about GEREDE's salary. She was told she could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances, and that if she told anyone that GERENDE had any connection with LNPURE, the connection would be denied and GERANDE would be terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the level of GERENDE's overt income (GERADE's nonthly salary from RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly).

Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it that as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts deterained should be paid from his overt income. This, of course, was strictly an informal arrangement, one which would stop the minute GERENDE stopped receiving a salary. Later, as LIEMPTY-19's Position hardened and her vindictiveness began to rule her actions, LIEMPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took for an amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance that GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in having him arrested (which she succeeded in doing twice), his job would be jeopardized. While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had no intention of causing his termination, and had never breathed a word to a soul about his RVROCK affiliation, her attitude was in fact jeopardizing his job and if he lost his job, she and the children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income. Her attitude is


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

doubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she became more and
more unreasonable, GERENDE was moving in the other direction.

5. The outcome can still not be predicted. As can be seen
   from GERENDE's menos, the two sides are still far apart on a number
   of points, including specifically money. LIEPTY-19 insists on
   10,000 pesos per month. GARRIDE is willing to pay 5,000. GEREZIDE
   is currently on half-pay, soch means that his total (211 source!
   nonthly income is around 14,000 pesos. From this, he would not only
   have to pay the amount which is finally agreed upon, he must also
   continue payments of 2500 pesos per month to LIEMPTY-19's father
   (paying off a loan obtained to build their house). The complicating
   factor is the uncertainly of GERENDE's future with RVROCK. The
   Station has maintained for some time that it is impossible to
   continue to pay GERENDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA
   and LILYRIC basehouses. Now that FERNALD has absorbed this duty
   with only small inconvenience and some loss of timeliness, it makes
   even less sense to put GERENDE to work only to do this. GARENDE
   has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and
   prior to the current peroonal crisis he had been told that he
   would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order
   to retain his position. As Headquarters is aware, he had been
   given additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
   to respond very well. There has never been any question of GERENDE'S
   ability. As we have previously stated, he is personable, intelligent,
   bilingual and binational, and has had good training and experienco
   in certain fields. On the other hand, there has long been doubt
   about his seriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition.
   The "reversal of roles" which he describes in one of the attached
   memos, which took place when he was confined to his home as an
   LP keeper, did more than cause domestic problems -- it apparently
   deprived him of the discipline of a daily job. His well-deserved
   reputation for being lazy was earned years ago.

6. The question which
   must be answered is whether or
   not to terminate GERENDE. He can be useful to the Station, but
   the station has learned to get along without him. What are the
   security hazards involved? The general range of his knowledge is
   described in paragraph 5 of reference. If all of this were blown,
   the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations
   against the MHHARSH target, would be considerable. The Station
   does not believe that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
   but it is impossible to predict what LIEMPTY-19 might do, particularly
   since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, having already
   lost a possible source of income through the termination. GERENDE's
   termination bonus would probably be in the neighborhood of ten
   thousand dollars. Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that
   he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
   this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
   two of them has never been mentioned.

LICALLA

7. The LICALLA basehouse continues to function without changés,
   except for the fact that Bruce H. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9
   since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings with LIEMPTY-9 are held once
   a week at pre-arranged times and places (well away from the MHHARSH
   area). Occasionally special meetings are called, by phone, by
   FERNALD, if special coverage is desired (as in the AESEASICK case,
   for example). There have been no problems, operational or personal,
   involving the basehaise or LIEMPTY-9 during the reporting period.
   LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporting period,
   and in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of
   MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage as requested. This
   "special coverage" consists of his observations of a selected
   individual -- who does he spend his time with, how is he behaving,
   when was he present (or absent), etc. LIEMPTY-9 spends over 40


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

# SECRET  MMA-38700

hours a weck just watching (and photographing) MWHARSH personnel, and over the years he has gottento know then, and their habits, very well. Ho can spot unusual or atypical behavior, and when he is asked to put a certain individual under close scrutiny, his comuments can be very useful. Newcomers, no matter what their cover, will frequently gravitate to their IS colleagues in the "safety" of the MMARS!! back yard, thereby enabling us to nake tentative ALKICK or AEGRIP identifications. TDYers can often be linked up with their internal escort officers. In the case of specific targets, LICALLA special coverage can sometimes give clues to personal relationships which can be exploited. During the reporting period we had special coverage on AESEASICK (to determine any changes in pattern following the AEMIDRIFF defection and following the operation against him -- ard in both cases LICALLA did report some change in pattern); 201-305870 (for much the same reason, although here the evidence was not as clear); AEPOLYP (to gather information on his patterns and his associations); ALTAKEOFF (for the same reason); and 201-833166 (to find out if he did, in fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were, a requirement which was quickly satisfied). Also, LICALLA has been asked to report on the arrival and activities of TDiers such as the AEKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that "security inspectors" are expected
-- he is told of the expected arrival of visitors, and he can spot a visitor or newcomer immediately), the possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to attempt to identify, at least by association, the person who went out to meet an LNREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970). The value of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Mexico City can scarcely be overstated.

LILYRIC

8.  There have been no changes during the reporting period of the operation of the LILYRIC baschouse activity, except that Bruce H. FERNALD took over the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from GERENDE in early December. FERNAID normally meets only LIEMPTY-13, at pre-arranged sites and times (also well away from the MARSH area), once a week for pick-up of the films and reports. He occa- sionally meets. LIEMPTY-14 (LIEPTY-13's wifc) when LIEMPTY-13 may be out of town. The LILYRIC coverage is a family enterprise with the work equally divided among LIEMPTY-13,-1,-26, and-27, who split up the hours of duty so that there is uninterrupted coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and 0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays. (Extra-hour or week-end coverage may be requested as necessary, and the LILYRIC personnel responded to the Station request for such extra coverage during the AEMIDRIFF and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy. Such coverage included, as in the past, daily logs on the comings and goings of MHHARSH officials, up-to-date recording of MIHHARSH license numbers, special activities and visitors (particularly Americans, of whom five were spotted and reported on during the reporting period), and some 3,500 photographs. As an example of the value of LILYRIC coverage, within one week of the change of license plates at the MHARSH Embassy (a biannual change affecting all of Mexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of the new numbers (along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among other things, this enabled the Station to identify AESEASICK'S companions during his last few days in Mexico. Without LILYRIC, identification of the new license plates would have taken nonths and would have handicapped our operations. LILYRIC has also provided special coverage of the visit of a Latin American CP representative, and is currently watching for the two AEKICK security technicians, 201-314616, and the man who went to meet the LNREAD agent. Also, LILYRIC has reported on visits of Mexican students and the identity of the MIHARSH representatives who deal with them or hand out literature to them. In short, LILYRIC's services, even though the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

MHHARSHers undoubtedly assume we have a LILYRIC-like facility, and act accordingly, are another vital element of the REDTOP program.

## LIETTY-4

9. LIEMPTY-4 bas continued to develop and to print all of Che LECALLA and LILYRIC photographs. No has been met regularly by Bruce H. FERNALD (taking over for GERINDE) since 26 November 1969. The first few meetings at that time (late November and early December) were arranged by FERNALD by telephone to LIEPTY-4 and primarily concerned LIEMPTY-4's reports on GEREDE'S family problems and related security arrangements. Since mid-December, LIEMPTY-4 resumed a regular schedule (usually weekly) of meetings at pre-arranged sites and times. LIEPTY-4 has been given a special extension in the Station to which he may call as "Dr. Carlos" to leave a message for "Victor" (FEIGALD). FERKALD can change meeting plans by directly calling LIEMPTY-4. The only personal problem directly involving LIEMPTY-4 was surgery on his knee which required his wearing a full cast on his leg for over six weeks. During this period when LIEMPTY-4 has been unable to drive, FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-4, for the exchange of LICALLA/LILYRIC films and prints, at LIEMPTY-4's office, under a suitable pretext and with appropriate security precautions. LIEMPTY-4's services aro invaluable since the Station could not, on a continuing basis, process the LIEMPTY material in its own photo lab.

## SECURITY

10. Other than the security problems inherent in GEREIDE'S personal problems, there have been no security problems during the reporting period.

## FUTURE PLANS

11. As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion that he must be terminated. This is not an easy decision to make, nor will it be easy to confront GERENDE with this decision. He has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK. However, as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able to get along without his services. Furthermore, the constant security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk. To try to molify her by promising her a portion of his salary is probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her attitude has progressively hardened. The Station, therefore, intends to terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970. GERENDE'S contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per full year. This would come to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons, including the need to preserve the security of the operation by ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000 (USD). Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY-19 of the termination, and, to keep her from revealing what she knows, she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herself. The Station does not believe that it would be equitable or sound from a security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has earned for this purpose. Therefore, while the figure will remain negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD) would be a reasonable amount. Total obligations for FY 1970 in the LIEPTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than $33,000 (USD). The Project has been approved in the amount of $38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It is therefore requested that the LIEMPTY Project be amended for FY 1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

SECRET IIIA-38700

12. Regarding the project renewal for FY 1971, as far as LICALLA, LILYRIC, and LIEMPTY-4 are concerned, co changes in procedure are planned. The product is useful, it is as timely az present circumstances permit, and the personnel involved are doing their jobs well. The only change forescen is an increase in salary for some, if not all, of these agents. The most recent salary increases took effect in May 1968. LIEPTY-4 has not had an increase since January 1967, and LIEMPTY-13 since January 1964. Increase in cost of living alono would be sufficient justification to raise salaries, but in the case of these agents their consistently excellent work deserves to be rewarded. These salary increases will probably range between 10 and 20 percent.

13. As for other project expenses, LIEMPTY-10 and LIEMPTY-11 will no longer be funded under LIEMPTY, but have been transferred to LIEMBRACE effective 1 July 1970. Real estate expenses should remain fairly constant, with perhaps a slight allowance for inflation. The rent on GEREDE's dark room (MEXI 137) will no longer be paid with his termination. MV-2823 will be sold or otherwise disposed of and should not be included in the project for FY 1971. Equipment and operational expenses should remain constant.

TO : Case Officer and Chief of Station

FROM : GERENDE

SUBJECT: GERENDE Background and Status Report
of Present Marital Conflict

1.  While this is not intended to be a full exposition of my
    personal and private life over recent years, I would like to make
    known some of the factors that have, from my point of view, led
    up to the present situation.

2.  I realize that the interests of the organization and the
    interest of the individuals who may have opportunity to come in
    contact with my case dictate as little personal involvement as
    possible in the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of
    security, compartmentation and efficiency prescribe the modue
    operandi and, to a great extent the modus vivendi, of agency
    personnel not only in the sense of earning a living but also in
    manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
    life, the better, but, as the years go by, changes may occur which
    go unreported or unnoticed and which may bring about unexpected
    events and repercussions. When s. person has been working for the
    Station, as I have, for fifteen years with little or no personnel
    handling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the
    job, and something comes up like the abrupt separation of my
    wife (LIEMPTY-19) and me with the personal and potential security
    risks it has entailed, I feel that some explanation is necessary.
    Should it be in order, I would like this explanation to reach not
    only my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the
    former Chief and officers with whom I have had the privilege to
    work over the years.

3.  I would like to give thanks, in advance, for the patience
    and understanding that have been shown me thus far. Whatever the
    final outcome, I know that people have been bending over backward
    to be helpful and patient in hopes of an early solution to the
    conflict.

4.  Back in September 1959, shortly after our wedding in late
    1958, my wife and baby girl, were moved, by the agency, into a


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

spacious, carpeted, furnished apartment near the DIZTAG Babassy, which served intermittently as a listening post-basehouse for the agency. At the time, LIEPTY-19 was working as the manager of the hookstore at the University of the Americas and, at the same tine, studying for a B.A. in philosophy. Thes, were happy tires. We received a two-month leave, went to drope, the Lome Olympics and visited LIEPTY-19's family in noliano. Back in dexico, when the base was in operation I stayed home a lot (one of the requirements), minded the dial and tape recorders and the baby an unfortunate reversal of marital roles. After exactly five years the baschouse was closed down and we lost rent, LIEMPTY-19's salary and my mother's salary which she had been receiving as part-time basehouse keeper. My mother and youngest sister gave considerable help in taking care of the baby while LIEMPTY-19 worked and when we wont to Europe and left the baby with them. This was during the first three years at the base until we had our second child, Christopher.

5. We moved to a small apartment in Lomas and, to supplement the loss of salary and rent allowance, the Station began paying 1,000 pesos a month for the use of a dark room I had built on the roof of the building. We had our third child, Madeleine, unplanned, two months after settling in the two-bedroom apartment. The apartment need not have been so small but we had chosen it for its location and style and because it was to be a temporary stop until we could find something better. We missed going to the Olympics in Tokyo which we had planned to do (1964) and instead began negotiating to buy a home building site at Rio Escondido but when the deal fell through, we decided to go on leave to surope again, this time with the two older children, leaving the baby with my sister. Se visited with LIEPTY-19's parents in Holland (they had moved back to Holland after having lived in Washington. D.C., since 1943) and the two childrer, stayed with them while LIEMPTY-19 and I made side trips. Traveling is LIEMPTY-19's greatest love in life. Upon our return to Mexico (I came back two weeks earlier), LIEMPTY-19 was so depressed at leaving Europe and being back in Mexico she was emotionally and physically inaccessible for about six weeks. She had not fully adjusted to living in Mexico or to settling Gown and becoming a housewife. Our cramped quarters, way of living, lack of money, my job, my irregular hours and habits, my Friday night poker games, the three children, all these got her down.

6. In the fall of 1965 after our return from Europe I began teaching English to beginners in the adult education program at the American School in the evenings. This started as a two-hour a week moonlighting experiment but by carly 1966, through student contacts made at the school, I had branched out to teaching at the offices of Carnation Milk Co., Singer Sewing Machine, and Richardson-Merrell Drug Co. for a total of about twenty hours per week. LIEMPTY-19, meantime, was working part-time at the Hamilton School in Lomas where the two older children were attending. The family finances improved and I was able to convince LIEMPTY-19 that

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

the best thing to do was to invest in land and build a house big
enough for our growing family which by now had a fourth child on
the way. With three friends as partners, I entered on a land-baying
deal which turned out to be complicated as ze bought the land in
the form of company stock. The company was liquidated and the
assets were distributed, as land, to the four partners. I paid for
our share with the proceeds from the sale of a mall Jot I had been
paying for since 1955. LIEMPTY-19 was at first reluctant to tie
us down with a house but when we finally got the papers and land
deed straightened out, she threw herself wholeheartedly into the
project and the building which began in August 1957. While LIEMPTY-19
supervised the construction, I worked during September and October
almost full-time for the Olympic Organizing Committee and the group
from Czechoslovakia which came to train in the pre-Olympics. My
father-in-law deposited money in Mexico to help us with the major
part of the financing of the house. We used $286,500 pesos of his
money and about $60,000 that LIEMPTY-10 and I had saved and got the
house finished enough to move in in March 1958. We were very short
on furniture and shortly after moving in bought three bedroom sets,
an automatic washer and even a piano. Naturally, cash was scarce,
dirt was plentiful. The yard was a pile of rubble, the carpentry
work had just begun, there were no closets, the house was unpainted.
Thereafter, we did things on the house as the money came in:
continued with carpentry, finished the driveway, put in grass,
built a fence and front gate.

7. Six months after moving in came time for the Olympics and
   I worked, unofficially this time, with the water polo team from
   Australia. LIEMPTY-19 worked for the month with the Dutch and
   Belgian radic and TV group. LIEMPTY-19 was, once again, caught up
   in the atmosphere of being among Europeans and doing something
   exciting and out of the routine of home and children. She fell in
   love with the Australiars as well, and for several months all she
   could talk of was that we should move to Australia. I gave it some
   thought but decided that we had neither the money to invest nor the
   youth and technical training to make it as pioncers "down under"
   and, on the other hand, family, friends, a house, and job seniority
   here in Mexico.

8. Toward the end of 1968, LIEMPTY-19 decided it was time for
   me to move out of the master bedroom as she could no longer face
   that aspect of our married life. For several months we tried this
   but it did not work out for me. One night in March 1969 after we
   returned home from a party, she asked me to help her undress and
   when she, once again, refused to have anything to do with me, I
   got rough with her, prompting a decision on her part, which she
   had already been pondering, to visit her parents in Holland as soon
   as possible. Her father provided the plane fare and she left in
   April for the United States to visit her brother and sister and
   Holland, for what she said would be a five week trip. She stayed
   away ten weeks. The four children remained with me, the maid, and

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

my mother who came to help three days a week. Upon her return, LIEMPTY-19 bore an air of resignation rather than of enthusiasm and, again, as on her previous return from Europe, was physically down and mentally unhappy. When asked about her thoughts on Australia she said that if she had wanted to live in Australia, she should have married an Australian. The separation had not improved our intimate relationship.

9. In August I was to take five weeks' leave and go with the children to Astro-world in Houston and visit my mother's family in South Carolina. When I suggested postponing making monthly payments on her father's loan until December when the Christmas Bonus would cover the back debt, in order to make the trip, she was adamant, saying that if I did not have the cash for going, I should not take leave. I borrowed from my life insurance policy and left with the three youngest children. Adriana had a touch of hepatitis and joined us three weeks later. After spending the month in South Carolina, we returned to Mexico to find that LIEMPTY-19 had very much enjoyed her solitude. We had already talked about divorce before her trip to Hollard in the spring. I had told her that I would not consider parting with the children and she said she would consider leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well as give her a substantial share of what she considered was her part of the house. The title of the house was in my name and had been since the buying of the land. LIEMPTY-19 said I could mortgage or sell the house but that the money was what she was mainly interested in. I told her that the sale of the house was not financially wise in its unfinished state and that the house and land are very likely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years considering the housing developments going on in the area. Added to this was the sentimental attachment to the house and area. A mortgage, on the other hand, for the amount of her father's loan plus what she was asking, was something I could not afford considering the more than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in Mexico.

10. At the same time, during September 1969, that we were going through the above-mentioned discussions, LIEMPTY-19 was taking a course at Japan Airlines to become a tour guide and group leader for trips to the Orient as early as November 1969 and, certainly, to Expo '70 in Osaka during the spring and summer of 1970. The received a diploma to that effect. I told her that if she wanted out of the marriage and wanted to be free to travel it was all right by me but that the children would stay with me and I would continue to repay her father at the agreed rate ($2500 per month and 5 percent per year). She then sought legal advice from an old friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margadant who, in turn, steered her to a young woman lawyer, Dra. Berta Martinez, who must have advised LIEMPTY-19 that under the local legal system the only way to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable support was to hang on to the children because LIEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face" in her attitude concerning them and she now said that she could not

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

- 5 -

"abandon" the children. I refused to visit her lawyer with her
saying I was not interested in getting divorced, whereas she said
that her mind was made up and that we would have to split up.

11. Things came to a head on the night of 12 November when I
    got home around 9 PM and she suggested we have a drink and talk
    things over. I mixed some martinis and she began laying down the
    terms under which she thought we should get divorced, i.e. I should
    move out of the house, mortgage to pay back her father's money,
    grant her custody of the children and support of 2,000 pesos per
    month per child ($8,000). I said I would not get divorced under
    those conditions and we discussed and argued in the kitchen for about
    three hours, killing a bottle of gin in the process. We went
    upstairs and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rouse the
    children, unsuccessfully, and then tried to leave the house which
    I would not let her do. She got hysterical, phoned a neighbor,
    Uta de la Hoz, then she went into the front yard and awakened the
    next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, and asked to go to
    their house. A few minutes later, Uta and her husband Guillerao
    came and LIEMPTY-19 went with then to their home two blocks away.
    About a half-hour later I walked up to Uta's to ask LIEMPTY-19
    to come home but was told that she was busy phoning her lawyer
    and would not return.

12. The following morning I took the children to school as
    usual and my sister Marcia (LIENTY-4's wife) picked them up ard
    took them to her house where I joined them for lunch. LIEPTY-19
    came by in the late afternoon while my sister was oot, picked up
    the children saying she was taking them home, failed to do so, then
    disappeared and was not to be found.

13. It was the subsequent action taken by LIEMPTY-IS in
    dropping her lawyers and taking on the services of Bernabe Jurado,
    the most notorious penal attorney in Mexico, that led to the
    potential security hazards that ensued.

9 March 1970

TO : Case Officer

FROM : GERENDE

SUBJECT: GERENDE Status Report

The present situation of the marital conflict between GERENDE and his wife (LIEMPTY-19) is as follows:

1.  GERENDE is living at his mother's apartment at 99 Carlos B. Zetina Street, Apartment 9. He has rented a three-bedroom apartment at Tornel 3 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where he has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his former address at Ladera 39, Lomas de Bezaros.

2.  The house at Ladera 39 is rented to an executive of Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife, and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality. The monthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years, beginning 1 February 1970.

3.  LIEMPTY-19 and the four children are apparently still living at the residence of the Netherlands' Ambassador, Baron Schelto Van Heemstra at Peña 360, Jardines del Pedregal. It seems fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two older children, Adriana and Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last two occasions he has seen them. They have been there since 5 December 1969. LIEMPTY-19 has denied that she has a fixed address and says that she is staying with "friends."

4.  LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to use the services of Bernabe Juardo as her lawyer and, through him, is pressing for even more advantageous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November. Please see the attached copy and translation of the latest proposal made by Juardo on 4 March 1970.

5.  The charges and accusations made by LIEMPTY-19 against GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:

a. Insults, threats and attempted homicide -- this charge rests at the 5º Juzgado Penal, 2ª Corte Penal located at


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 77

- 2 -

Lecumberri. The judge is CRUZ Mellado. These charges have not been pressed since they were originally made on 13 November 1969 by LIEMPTY-19. The ruling on these charges, should the case come to trial, must be made by three judges of the 2ª Corte Penal composed of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Juzgados Penales. The Judge of the 6º Juzgado is Lic. QUIRAZCO, an alumnus of GERENDE's lawyer, Jorge Mario MAGALLON. Together they have, on two occasions, been to speak to Judgo CRUZ Mellado who agreed not to issue an arrest warrant and who has, finally, called for a hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at 10:00. MAGALLON has given GERENDE assurances that the charges are likely to be dismissed.

b. Fraud -- this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her lawyer on 11 December 1969, the day after GERENDE left the Villa Obregon jail after having spent a week there for disobeying a court order. (The court order had consisted of an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house and to have LIEMPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as the temporary custodian of the children. GERENDE refused them admisson under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon Judge's order, so the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered, on the spot, a 10-day detention. Subsequently, the judge, LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings as incompetent. The judge has had to face charges of collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e. Magallon and Jurado. The charge of fraud rests at Mesa 31ª of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal. The Public Ministry Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz. LIEMPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under the separate property marriage clause had wrongfully placed the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud. Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christmas 1965 in a complicated transaction involving three other partners: Robert Bancroft WHITEHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and Janes Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property in their respective names with the complete knowledge of their spouses. Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen months the deeds were issued. LIEPTY-19 supervised and prodded the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware that the property was in GERENDE's name. In August 1967 when construction of the house began, LIEMPTY-19's father's money was used which he had deposited in Mexico for the purpose. Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan agreement, GERENDE has been paying it off and has receipts from LIEMPTY-19 to show for it.

GERENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura") pre-dating the construction of the house and the receipts

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

### 3

showing up to date payment of the loan at the *mesa 31ª*." No further action has been taken by LIEFTY-19 or her lawyer on this matter but the charge has not finally been settled and is still pending. The charge is, of course, unfounded and is awaiting the proper "lubrication" in order to be filed away.

c. Neglect -- this charge was made by LIEPTY-19 in December 1969 at the 7º Juzgado Mixto de Paz claiming that GERENDE had abandoned LIEMPTY-19 and the children to their fate and that they were utterly destitute. GERENDE was not notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a bearing at the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GERENDE, took him to the Procuraduria and from there to Lecumberri. This process involved being finger-printed and mugged. The following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woman) formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidence. GERENDE and Magallon went back on 5 March to pick up the bond money and see if Jurado had appealed but he had not and, apparently, that matter is closed.

6. On 14 November 1969, one day after LIEMPTY-19 disappeared from home taking the children with her, GERENDE brought charges against her for minor lesions and showed medical proof thereof. The hearing of 9 February after which GEREIDE was detained, was called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA. GERENDE reiterated the charge, LIEMPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her, ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in once a week.

7. LIEMPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron Academy on Caleri Street in San Angel Inn. The two older children are going to school there. During the latter part of November, all December and half of January, the children did not attend any school. On three occasions GERENDE has been to the school at 13:30 to try to speak to LIEMPTY-19 and see the children. LIEMPTY-19 has objected to this and the meetings have been short and fruitless except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch Ambassador's. GERENDE's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).

8. After the Villa Obregon judge dismissed himself from the divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case went to Coyoacan and Xochimilco respectively where the judges, in turn, excused themselves from the case and it has finally come to reside at the 1st Juzgado Civil in the D.F. The judge is Olda CORREA (soman) and has the reputation of being tough and pretty straight. Since LIEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated on GERENDE's part. LIEMPTY-19, on the otherland, has not had

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

GARENDE served with papers though his current address is known, apparently because she is still seeking a voluntary divorce along the lines and terms which are stated in the accompanying set of proposals. GEREIDZ cannot begin to accept these proposals in their present form as they are patently unfair and hardly a point to beginning bargaining from.

8 March 1970

The following proposals were made to GERADE on 4 March 1970 (Monday) by LIEMPTY-19's lawyer, Bernabe Jurado, through a mutual friend, Licenciado Carlos Heyn, to wit:

TERMS under which the problem of (LIEMPTY-19) and (Raymond H. GERENDE) could be solved.

1.  The right (patria potestad) to the winors would be kept by both the mother and father.

2.  The guardianship and custody of the four children is entrusted to the mother. The father may visit the children once a week between 10:00 and 19:00 hours; he may take them out once a month and will return them to the mother's address before 19:00.

3.  The father is obliged to pay the mother the sum of 10,000 pesos MN, in advance, por month beginning with the month of November 1969, since which time he has not given the mother or children any money at all.

4.  This agreement will be raised to the level of a formal public writ the day it is signed by both parties.

5.  Both spouses agree to divorce voluntarily under the terms of this agreement.

6.  Upon termination of the divorce procedure, by mutual consent, both parties will desist from the civil and penal actions that either might have initiated against the other.

7.  Both spouses are obliged to attend punctually the meetings that the legal procedure establishes as well as grant the guarantees demanded by the Public Ministry and acting Judge for the approval of this agreement and granting of the divorce.

8.  In order that the father may visit his children and take them out, the mother is obliged to give notice of every change of address.

9.  With the exception of the one day a week that the father may visit the children and the one day a month when he may take


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 81

them out, the father contracts the obligation of absolutely abstaining from calling on the mother's address, so that she may carry on her life freely without neglecting her children.

10. While the voluntary divorce is being processed, the mother and children will live at and, as above stated, to satisfy their needs, the father will make the first monthly payment of $10,000.

11. Neither the father nor the mother may take the children out of Mexican territory without the authorization of the other.

12. Since GERENDE owes the parents of LIEMPTY-19 the sum of $286,500 plus agreed-on interest, minus whatever payments he has been able to make, the said GERENDE is obliged to mortgage the house at 39 Ladera, Lomas de Bezares in this city, precisely during the course of the divorce procedure by mutual consent as established in the antecedent clauses and before the divorce is granted so that LIEMPTY-19's parents are reimbursed on their loan or on the outstanding unpaid balance.

13. The expenses of making this agreement a formal writ as well as the fees of B. Juardo will be paid by GERENDE but these will be fixed in an equitable manner by Carlos Heyn to whose decision both will submit.

14. In case of failure to comply with any of the clauses of this agreement at any time or for just one time, either by GERENDE or LIEMPTY-19, both agree to expressly establish the following sanctions and terms:

15. If GERENDE is the one who violates any clause just one time, he will forfeit the house at Ladera 39 to the mother and children, LIEMPTY-19, Adriana Juliette, Christopher Ramon, Maria Madeleine, and Laurence Fernando, and said property will belong to the above mentioned persons.

16. If LIEMPTY-19 is the one who violates the terms of this agreement for just one itme, she will lose the custody of children in favor of the father or whatever person he designates for the guardianship and custody of the minors.

17. Since LIEMPTY-19 has to establish an appropriate place to live, in the company of her four children, both parties agree that the household effects will be turned over by GERENDE, to LIEMPTY-19 for that purpose, as well as the automobile she has been using throughout the marriage.

Mexico, D.F., 4 March 1970

LIRAZOR/Progress Report for the Period 1 August-30 September 1969

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information

REFERENCE : ΗΜΜΑ-37623, 4 August 1969 (Last Progress Report)

1. Although this report might normally be submitted one month from now, the use of Oliver G. SCANTLING has shifted sufficiently to warrant a special report at this time. Our next progress report will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 December unless exceptional circumstances justify another change.

2. The fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who has surfered the past six weeks from paratyphoid) is that he has been divorced from routino cut-out operations and will henceforth be used for priority tasks and targets which will better utilize his proven talents. First, in late September ZARBOCK took over LICASA-1 for direct handling. The LICASA operation offered no particular challenge to SCANTLING and it is doubtful that his intermediary role offered any particular additional security in this case. In fact, if a flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the GOM. Second, it has been decided that SCANTLING will very soon turn LIANVIL-1 over to Raymond GERENDE. The details are presently being worked out.

3. PLANS: In line with our decision to use SCANTLING for re-cruitment efforts principally (and less so for routine agent handling) he is presently preparing for a recruitment attempt against Subject of *MEXICO CITY-1502. When that operation is completed he will be tar-geted against the MIMARSH target both through a commercial outlet of the Bloc and through various clubs and sports centers where he may have access to MIHARSII types.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Officer, Western Hemisphere
Division

VIA : WH/FI
WH/CONTRACTS

SUBJECT : Recommendation to Amend the Contract of
Raymond H. GERENDE (Contract Agent) to
Include Improved Termination Benefits
and a Salary Increase

1. During the past year Mexico City Station has
   submitted several dispatches recommending that paragraph
   11 of Subject's contract be amended to include new benefits
   in the event of Subject's termination and/or resignation
   from Agency service. These Station recommendations have
   been carefully reviewed by C/WH/Contracts and a Memorandum
   was forwarded to C/WH/1 containing guidance on the suggested
   contract amendment.

2. The above information has been reviewed again by
   AC/WII/1, and we are requesting approval for the following
   amendments to paragraph 11 of Subject's contract:

A) In the event of GERENDE's termination by the
Agency he will receive three month's pay plus one
month's pay for every full year of service since
18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at
the time of termination.

B) In the event of resignation and/or voluntary
retirement upon 60 days notice the following schedule
would be acceptable to the Agency as being in its best
interests and a payment considered as a terminal payment
as follows:

(1) Less than 15 years service (prior to March
1970) 20 days pay for each full year of service.

(2) Over 15 years service, but less than 20
years service (prior 18 March 1975) three months
salary plus 20 days pay for each full year of service.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 97

(3) Over 20 years service, three months salary plus one month's pay for each full year of service.

(4) All payments above are to be calculated at the rate of pay applicable at the time of retirement and/or resignation.

3. As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note the following:

A) GERENDE is a Mexican citizen, working for the Agency since 18 March 1955 under an MOC, who considers himself to be a "career" employee of the Agency, and whose initial local employment for cover purposes was largely notional under a system of "ghost payrolling". GERENDE received no income or benefits from this "cover" position which terminated due to the demise of the company on 31 December 1967. GERENDE's other "cover" is self generated in that he gives English lessons in his spare time to middle management Mexican nationals employed by American owned companies in Mexico City. His income benefits from this "cover" are minimal, but suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source of his income. In conclusion, GERENDE is considered by the Station to be a full time contract agent, on call at all times for operational activity. Any other local benefits which may accrue to him by the virtue of his being a Mexican citizen should not, we feel, be a concern of this Agency given the above circumstances of his employment with us.

4. This Branch is of the belief that the resignation and/or retirement schedule outlined in paragraph 2, B above provides career benefits for GERENDE in the event that he must resign and/or retire in the event of unforseen personal circumstances. It additionally rewards him for his loyalty of service, and at the same time provides him with incentive to remain in Agency service for the additional financial benefits that will accrue to him providing both future security and incentive.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

SECRET

5. During the past two years GERENDE has served as a principal agent handler for a sensitive fixed surveillance project; has carried out unilateral recruitment approaches against the Cuban target; has been used in special support investigations; and is presently being considered for use in special operations of a sensitive nature. A review of the progress reports in GERENDE's operations discloses that the Station has been more than satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to take advantage of his full potential. GERENDE's last salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum was granted in July 1965, and there have been no increases since. Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over amendment of paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract has been in progress for over one year and a half, we are of the belief that the Station wished to finalize this amendment prior to requesting a salary increase for the agent. It is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval be given for a salary increase from $6,500 to $7,000 effective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended. The Field Station will be queried for their approval via cable prior to implementation of the contract amendment.

1. Reference acks that GERMES's contract be auended to provide the following:

a. Three conthe pay for purposes of a termination payment.

b. The following Lehedule in the event of resignation upon 60 days notice which would be accepteble to tha Agency ac being in its best intercats and a payment considered as a termination or termini payment na 20llows:

Less than 15 years cervico (prior 18 March 1970)-- 20 days for cach full year.

Over 15 years but less than 20 years service (prior 18 March 1975)-three Lonths plus 25 days for each fuil year.

Over 20 years--three months plus 1 month for gach Zull year.

2. The Station has pointed out that Dexican law requires an cployer (presusing that we are being considered ca an employer in the sence of Mexican law) to grant an employee who is torchinted three nontius ray plus an additional 20 days pay for each full year of service. In the event of resignation, Kozicra las does not make any requirement for paynent by the cxploser to the individual.

3. GERMES's basic contract was cffective 1 October 1955. An amendment, cffective 1 July 1950, providen for a terminal peyrent of de ronths salary for each year of service since 18 March 1955, and thus bears out the Mention's use of tho dato 18 Narch, 1955 for service computation.

4. It is to be noted that GERARD, who was born December 7, 1932, will have 43 years service in March 1975, and in December 1975 he will be 43 years of age.

5. The Station did not indicate whether or not current covert employment provides for a termination pay or pension benefits. American law does provide that an individual covered under their "Social Security Commitment" program is eligible for annuity at age 65. Should he retire between the ages of 60 to 64, he would receive a reduced annuity.

6. I believe the Station's proposal is quite practical except it does, of course, give the individual an option of resigning at any time and time being eligible to receive a "resignation payment" rather than what should, I believe, be considered as a retirement payment or program. I, therefore, suggest the following:

a. That prior to effecting a contract amendment providing for a resignation payment for acceptable reasons, information be obtained as to whether GERARD would actually be entitled to receive from his overt employer additional payment(s) for termination and/or retirement. This then could be used as a basic figure on which to build in terms of termination and/or retire- ment.

b. The proposed schedule certainly appears adequate. As there is no limit on the accumulation, the individual might well reach a point of "temptation" to resign. I believe there should be a maximum limit on accumulation - why encourage the individual to resign?

c. As both the Station and GHQMMDE want some program for purposes of security and incentive, I believe more emphasis should be given to such a retirement program rather than on "resignation". Similarly, retirement would not be thought of at age 43.

A retirement program could provide for participation by the individual and also take into consideration what the individual would receive from his country's Social Security program. This type of plan would give the individual a vested interest as well as a feeling of security in terms of the future.

SUBJECT:
Raymond H. GERENDE's Cover Status

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

MICROFILM

1. In preparing a recent request for an amendment to Raymond H. GERENDE's contract, it occurred to us that it would probably be useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERENDE's cover status. As a full-time contract agent, GERENDE is on call at all times for operational activity. His cover activity not only provides him with the necessary flexibility, it is also solid enough to provide him with a plausible explanation of his existence and his income.

2. GERENDE has two major cover activities. One is the teaching of English, mainly to middle-management personnel of American-owned firms in Mexico City. This is done on a regular basis for a few hours each day and earns GERENDE an income of about 5000 pesos per month. His second cover activity, and one which is largely a cover and not really activity, is working as a salesman for IDEN A. GERENDE actually earns only about 500 pesos per month from this, but this fact is a closely guarded secret. GERENDE's acquaintances assume that a good part of his income comes from this cover. Previously, GERENDE had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month, ostensibly from IDEN B. IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for years he had carried GERENDE on his payroll as an independent salesman on commission. He would ostensibly pay GERENDE a certain amount of money, and IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns and social security based on this alleged payment. IDEN B would also pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed. This

system of "ghost payrolling" is quite common in Mexico, as everybody
gains: the company because its declared profit is lower than it
really is and, therefore, subject to less tax, and the individual
because he is ordinarily given a kickback for allowing his name to
be used (or in GERENDE's case, because it provided cover).

3. All this ended on 31 December 1967, when LISTERINE sold
   IDEN B to IDEN A. For a while thereafter, GERENDE paid taxes only
   on the money he actually earned with IDEN A, which was, as stated,
   about 500 pesos per month. As of 1 July 1968, however, LISTERINE
   arranged, at GERENDE's request, to have his accountant (who continued
   to handle GERENDE's taxes as a favor to LISTERINE) to lump together
   all of GERENDE's earnings (from teaching as well as IDEN A) as
   "professional earnings" and to file returns for GERENDE which included
   the total amount. This is not quite as satisfactory as the old
   arrangement (among other things GERENDE must now pay his own taxes)
   but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate. Other than LISTERINE
   and the accountant, no one knows that GERENDE'S ostensible earnings
   have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person
   who is aware of GERENDE's tie with WOFIRM.

1. The Station has finally compiled the information necessary to answer the questions raised in Ref B and, in doing so, wishes to repeat the request originally made in Ref A to amend Raymond H. GERENDE'S contract to provide him with a certain amount of job security.

2. First, Ref B raised the point that there had been no efficiency reports written on GERENDE or "evidence of outstanding performance." GERENDE's performance has been evaluated regularly within the context of the regular LIEMPTY Project progress reports, and a review of the past several reports will demonstrate that the Station has been more than satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to take advantage of his full potential. The Station does not believe, however, that "evidence of outstanding performance" should be a prerequisite for the type of contract amendment being requested. It is perfectly true, as pointed out in Ref B, that the Station had gone on record in 1959 that GERENDE should not be paid a termination bonus if he should resign simply to get the extra money or to pursue another career. By now, however, GERENDE has cast his lot with WOFIRM. He really has no other career, and to try to start one at this point would be extremely difficult. On the other hand, if he should decide to try his hand at something else, the Station would

undoubtedly wish to reward his long years of loyal service with a generous termination payment. He has earned it, and only termination for cause per paragraph 10 (b) of his contract would prevent him from receiving it.

3. Mexican law (it is the law, not custom) says that an employee who is fired must be paid three months' salary plus twenty days' salary for each full year employed by the company at the pay rate existing at the time of separation. GERENDE's current cover company adheres to this formula. Since GERENDE's termination clause has always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for every year of service (in the event of his termination by WOFIRM), we would not want to change that, and in fact we wish to add to it the three months' pay guaranteed by Mexican law. At the same time, we do see some virtue in the suggestion in paragraph 3 of Pef B that full retirement benefits (in the event of GERENDE's resignation) would apply only after 20 years' service, with lesser benefits until then. Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to 15 full years of service (i.e. prior to 18 March 1970) he be paid twenty days' salary for each full year, that after 15 years but prior to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full months' salary, and that aïter 20 years he be paid three months' salary plus one months' salary for every full year. It is true, of course, that Mexican law does not make any provision for payment of a termination bonus to an employee who resigns, but most enlightened companies have some sort of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out, "working for WOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional financial consideration." In the case of GERENDE, we are not attempting to establish any pattern. This is a special case (as are most) and the Station merely wishes to insure that GERENDE, who has made WOFIRM a career without receiving any career benefits in return, is rewarded for his loyalty and is given some incentive for the future. GERENDE is not without his faults, and he is being adequately compensated for the work he performs, but we cannot expect to get more out of him without showing him greater respect.

4. The Station requests, therefore, that the following amendment be made in paragraph 11 of GERENDE's contract:

a. In the event of GERENDE's termination by WOFIRM, he will receive three months' pay plus one month's pay for every full year of service since 18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at the time of termination.

b. GERENDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be accepted by WOFIRM as being in its best interest, and GERENDE will be eligible for terminai payment according to the following formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERENDE will receive. 20 days' pay for every full year of service since 18 March 1955; after 18 March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GERENDE will receive three months' pay plus 20 days for every full year since 18 March 1955; after 18 March 1976 GERENDE will receive three months pay plus one month for every full year of service since 18 March 1955. All payments are to be calculated at the rate applicable at the time of resignation.

5. Paragraph 10 (b) will, of course, remain in force.

6. Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another year without change. We assume that this has been done, although we have not been notified.

LIEMPTY Progress Report, 1 July through 31 December 1968

Reference: IUNMA-35030, 22 July 1968

## SUMMARY

1.  There have been no basic changes in the operation of the project during the reporting period. Raymond H. GERDE continues as principal agent, handling the personnel of the two base houses, LILYRIC and LICALLA, and performing other additional tasks. On 27 December 1968, consistent with our effort to get as much of the support activity as possible handled by outside officers, direct agent-handling responsibility for GERERDE and the LIEDTTY project was turned over to Druce H. FERNALD. Vincent P. RIZZUTO remains as alternate and as FERNALD'S inside contact.

## GERINDE

2.  Until the introduction of FERNALD, there was no change in the mecting arrangements with GERENDE. Meetings were held on an average of three times per week until October, when LIEMPTY-19 (GERENDE's wife) was relieved of the responsibility of transcribing the Spanish-language portions of LIEVOY coverage of the BEDOX installation. Thereafter meetings averaged twice per weck, the main business being the transfer of LIEMPTY base house material and discussion of base house business.

3.  GERENDE's agent handling responsibilities within the LILYRIC project remain as previously reported. He had also handled ESR1AN-3 until the latter's termination in August 1968. He developed a good relationship with PAC-3, and he showed that he is quite capable, with proper case officer guidence, of providing useful service to the Station in the handling of agents beyond the support type to which he had been limited in the past. The Station intends to try to expand this role, with due regard for security and for GERENDE's limited experience. Furthermore, the Station still has every intention of using GERENDE selectively in cultivation and development of operational leads, as outlined in reference. No such leads were found for GERENDE during the reporting period (among other reasons, we have no intention of giving GERENDE a lead simply for the sake of giving him something to do), but as soon as a suitable lead is uncovered, it will be passed to GERENDE.

4.  GERENDE was particularly useful during the Olympic period. While he did not get a job with the Olympic Committee as he had hoped, his wife was employed as a translator by the European television networks who had come to cover the games. This, plus other personal contacts, gave GERENDE a certain amount of access to Olympic facilities. Both GERENDE and his wife helped considerably in the distribution of AEEGGILEAD material, and GERENDE performed a number of miscellaneous tasks assisting the Station in various Olympic responsibilities.

5.  GERENDE has also been used in support of JMROD operations, such as making mail pick-ups and delivering material and making phone calls to AMBASSOON. Following the Warsaw Pact Powers' invasion of Czechoslovakia, GERENDE was asked to cover a demonstration in front of the Soviet Embassy, and he wrote a good report which was used in Embassy briefings. Recently, GERENDE has enrolled at the University of the Americas to work for an M.A. in contemporary Mexican history. The Station will explore the possibility of his getting access to persons or information of interest on the University campus.

## LICALIA

6.  LIEMPTY-9's work (in the LICALIA base house) was inhibited in July due to the construction of a raid's room near his working quarters. During the reporting period, however, he took a total of 2,217 operational photos. His regular reporting and commentary continued as in the past. LIEMPTY-9 is a steady and dependable performer, and his unique vantage point remains the source of the most interesting and revealing photos as well as often very informative reporting.

## LILYRIC

7.  LIEMPTY-13, -14, -26, and -27 have been able to keep the LILYRIC base house manned on a regular basis from 0800 to 1800 hours weekdays and 0800 to 1500 hours on Saturdays, with other hours coverable upon request. This has proven to be a far better arrangement than depending on LIMITED for some of this coverage. In addition to the 6,763 operational photos taken during the reporting period and the daily fixed surveillance reports, LILYRIC reporting is of considerable help in compiling current vehicle and license plates lists, PCS arrivals and departures, unusual activities such as demonstrations or protests, unusual or lengthy absences of personnel, etc., all of which have obvious CI importance. It was LILYRIC photos which made it possible for LNERGO to identify the Subject of 201-841520, who had been in clandestine contact with AEGRIP officers. LILYRIC also reported on a half dozen other American (or American appearing) visitors, some of whom it was possible to identify through tracing license plates.

LIMITED

8. As reported in Ref, LIEMPTY-G has been terminated and the LIMITED base house closed. All equipment has been turned in, and it can truthfully be said that due to the continuing quality performance of LICALLA and LILYRIC, LIMITED has not been missed at all.

PHOTO LAB

9. LIEPTY-4 continues to process all photos made by the base houses. In addition, 101 enlargements were made during the reporting period, and 210 prints for LILETRAP. The quality of LIEMPTY-4's work is good, and he rarely misses his routine deadlines.

LIEMPTY Progress Report, 1 November 1967 through 30 June 1968

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

REFERENCE : HMMA-33459, 8 November 1967

Summary

1.  During the reporting period, the project's principal agent, Raymond H. GERENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed at broadening his usefulness to the Station. These tasks included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a recruited agent, ERFAIN-3.*GERENDE did well, and it is believed that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the same token, the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset. The LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper- ations. The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIEMPTY-6, were terminated on 31 May 1968. Termination was decided upon partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measurably decreased the reliability and effectiveness of LIEMPTY-6's work. LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC Base House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC and LIMITED had together in the past.

2. During the reporting period, the case officer has been meeting GERENDE an average of three times per week. Meetings are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Meetings average 20 to 30 minutes. GERENDE turns over to the case officer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has picked up from the base houses since the previous meeting, along with brief contact reports on his meetings with base house representatives. Reports on other operational activities are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instructions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge- ments which may be desired by the Station. Also, LIENVOY tapes and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting. (The departure of LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a BEDOX transcriber. As a temporary solution, pending the return of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber, GERENDE's wife, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50 pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the tapes. She does the work in her home, and GERENDE transports the tapes.)

3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for the following LIEMPTY agents: LIEMPTY-4 (photo-processor; met twice per week); LIEMPTY-6 (LIMITED; met once per week until termination); LIEMPTYS 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13 normally met twice per week -- in his absence LIEMPTY-27 makes meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). He is responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling all of the administrative problems which may develop. To judge from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from them - particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel.

4. As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the Mexican MHRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit. His MHRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal, but we expect it to start picking up again. GERENDE has conducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within the MHRAVEL complex, and we have instructed him to try to get an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL delegation as possible.

5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had performed nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the same. Furthermore, GERENDE's standing assignments (LIEMPTY base houses, MHRAVEL activity, and occasional support of JAMROD requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough of GERENDE's time. GERENDE is rather firmly committed to WOFIRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOFIRM for over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any consequence. By the same token, he was, through no fault of his own, doing less work for WOFIRM than at any time in his career. GERENDE's operational exposure through the years dictated more and more restrictions on his activity, for sound security reasons. The solution to GERENDE'S problem (lack of a promising future) and the Station's (not getting its money's worth) seemed to be to give GERENDE additional tasks which he could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security precautions. Since most of GERENDE's support activities had been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to be taken in committing him further in this direction. It was decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in a non-FJSTEAL field.

6. In line with the above reasoning, GERENDE was introduced to Andrew R. DOSCHER on 17 February 1968. The idea was that GERENDE would be trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his operations against Central American targets. GERENDE's principal duty thus far has been to take over the handling of ERFAIN-3, under DOSCHER's close supervision and guidance. GERENDE has performed quite creditably in this task. He seems interested in the work and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in dilatory reporting. IS GERENDE can overcome this (and both case officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be cvery reason to believe GERENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.

7. GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing (in alias) a girl who, per LIENVOY, was being cultivated by AERODENT. Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the assignment, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and gaining her confidence. It is quite likely that he could have recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODENT, but as this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was launched and it was not felt that attempting to recruit the girl would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at least (among other things, there was no indication that she had had any contact with AERODENT for some months). The only flaw in GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to get around to doing the job. It should be mentioned, however, that at the same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house, which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though construction is still not entirely completed.

8. Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian translator working for the NHRAVEL committee.

Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT:
Amendment to GERENDE's Contract

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:
Reference: HMMT 8751

1. Before amending GERENDE's contract in accordance with reference, we would like to clarify a few points about GERENDE and about terminations and resignations in general.

2. We assume from the files that GERENDE's performance has been entirely satisfactory but since there are no efficiency reports or actual evidence of outstanding performance, we would like to have a statement from the station which would justify the requested amendment. Nine years ago the station said, in IDMA 13571 that "station would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment if he elects to resign just to receive some extra money or to pursue some other career." That was a long time ago, however, and thirteen years of loyal collaboration may very well have changed your mind on this point.

3. Reference says that GERENDE has no intention of resigning, and we hope this is true if you feel that he is still as valuable as he ever was. Assuming, however, for a moment that he might have in the back of his mind the idea of leaving in a few months to take a more secure and productive job while the taking is good - do you feel that if he quits at his own convenience he is entitled to the same benefits that would normally accrue to him if he had worked longer and was released at our convenience? Assuming that he were to quit next week, would you still want to pay him the proposed termination bonus? Or would you want to include in the

contract the proviso that full retirement benefits (three months salary plus one month's salary for each year worked) should apply after, say, twenty year's service, with lesser benefits to apply between now and then?

4. Could you recapitulate for us the prevailing Mexican law or custom (which is it?) on termination-at-the-convenience-of-the- employer? A number of months ago you told us that it was three months pay plus 20-days-per-year-worked, but the LIFIRE/4 and 5. MOC's said that "following local custon of termination subject only has to be paid one month's salary for each year of employment". Your proposed GERENDE terminal payment formula, (which may be a special case rather than a pattern and which, as we understand it, makes no distinction between voluntary resignation and termination- at-the-convenience-of-the-employer) is one month's pay for each full year of employment, plus three months pay at the rate applic- able at the time of termination. Does this imply that the one month's pay for each year worked is computed at the rate of pay pre- vailing during each respective year worked? Does Mexican law or custom dictate the payment of terminal bonus to employees who resign voluntarily? (Working for WOFIRM is a very special case, obviously, and deserves exceptional financial consideration, but we do want to understand the background as it applies to commercial work so that we may have a frame of reference or point of departure).

5. We apologize for the long delay in sending this dispatch. It was originally written in Harch, and mislaid in transit, but we thought it had been pouched.

6. Apart from the foregoing, do you recommend any changes in GERENDE's contract which will be due for renewal on 1 October 19687

INFO:

FROM: Acting Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: Amendment of Raymond H. GERENDE's Contract

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:

REFERENCE: HMMW-8281, 2 December 1959

1. It is requested that the following amendments be made to Paragraph 11 "Terminal Payment" of Raymond H. GERENDE'S contract (see reference):

a. The amount of terminal payment, in addition to one month's compensation for each full year of employment since 18 March 1955, should also include three months' pay at the rate applicable at the time of termination.

b. GERENDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be accepted by the government as being in its best interest, and GERENDE will be eligible for full terminal payment.

2. The revision requested in paragraph 1 a above is for the purpose of having the contract conform to Mexican law, which calls for three months' salary plus one month for each year of service. The second revision is designed to give GERENDE the option of resigning without jeopardizing his terminal payment. He has no intention of resigning, but he feels that the contract, as it stands, leaves him with no security. The terminal payment is his only retirement program, but as written it does not give him the option of retiring. The Station advised GERENDE that any request of his to retire would undoubtedly be accepted as long as there were no adverse security or operational factors, but agrees that in fairness to GERENDE, who has, in effect, chosen a career with WOFIRM, the clause should be rewritten to guarantee him a termination payment. GERENDE understands that paragraph 10 (b) of the contract will remain in force, and if invoked will deprive him of any terminal payment.

We plan to use GERENDE in similar roles in the future as opportunities arise, and for this reason we plan to document him with a set of false Mexican documentation.

3.  All assets involved in the LIEMPTY Project performed in a sat- isfactory manner during this period. Effective 1 July 1967 LIEMPTY-4 and LIEMPTY-11 were given slight salary increases, because of their increased activity.

4.  There were no known security incidents affecting the LIEMPTY Project or the assets involved during the three months under review.

## LICALLA

5.  This basehouse, the operator of which is LIEMPTY-9, provided 1277 frames of operational photographs covering the patio and garden area of PJSTEAL. LIEMPTY-9 also prepared fixed-surveillance reports, sighting reports and special notes and comments.

## LILYRIC

6.  The LILYRIC basehouse, which is staffed by LIEMPTY-13, -14 and -27, produced 2854 frames of operational photograph during the period. The LILYRIC basehouse operators continued to prepare fixed-surveillance reports on each member of PJSTEAL and turned these in on a weekly basis. LIEMPTY-27 resumed his duties on 1 July as scheduled and this basehouse has now reverted to its normal hours of coverage. (See reference relative to the absence of LIEMPTY-27.)

## LIMITED

7.  The LIMITED Basehouse, operated by LIEMPTY-6, produced 279 frames of operational photographs plus weekly fixed surveillance reports on each of the members of PJSTEAL. The LIMITED basehouse was closed from 17 through 22 July because of the illness of LIEMPTY-6. During this period LIEMPTY-6 did very little radio-alerting for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team because of the variation of the surveillance team's activities.

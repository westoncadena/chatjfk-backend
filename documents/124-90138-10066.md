# Office Memorandum

TO: MR. F. A. FROHBOSE

FROM: S. J. PAPICH

SUBJECT: PAUL HICKMAN INFORMATION CONCERNING

*Communist Party-Cuba*

DATE: 12-2-59

The following information was furnished to the Liaison Agent on 12-1-59 by Mrs. Jane Roman, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Swiss police recently located Hickman in Zurich, Switzerland. Information was developed by the Swiss indicating that subject allegedly was involved in business dealings relating to the sale of arms to the Castro Government. With the collaboration of Swiss authorities, a CIA representative interviewed subject on 11-27 and 28-59. The subject has been characterized as a confidence operator and very unreliable. He claimed that he already had volunteered information concerning his knowledge of activities in Cuba to "friends of Senator Smathers." Hickman claimed that he had been in contact with a Soviet Embassy representative, Bern, Switzerland, in connection with a sale of Cuban sugar to Russia. Hickman claimed that the Soviet had given him considerable encouragement and indicated that the transaction would go through. The Soviet then suddenly told him that the deal was off.

Mrs. Roman stated that CIA does not plan to cover subject's activities in the absence of a specific request from the Bureau.

ACTION:

This information is being directed to the attention of the Nationalities Inteligence Section.

1. This dispatch is to inform Headquarters of the main developments and problems concerning WIRCOUE to date, and to set forth in detail Station thoughts and plans concerning WIRCOUE.

2. WIRCOUE, in his contacts with Robert B. Gutman, and in the last two weeks with Lester E. Sulvuck, has always presented a multitude of ideas which include a strong element of violence, mayhem or just plain larceny. In spite of being given a flat, no, he has persisted in desiring a gun. When it was mentioned that these were hard to find, and that a pistol or rifle was in addition a dangerous thing for the Congolese to find on a white man, he said that that was all right, a machine gun would do. He even suggested the formation of a special force of whites, with himself as the leader, naturally, to "fight the Congolese in case of trouble." We concur with the description of SAWIROUD in para 5. Ref. S. expert for the means to obtain the best results from him. Ref. part to his own devices to implement and/or uninvestment, WIRCOUE can all too often create more problems than he answers. His security consciousness is not outstanding from an operational point of view. Control is seemingly lost when WIRCOUE can talk over his problems at frequent intervals and discuss them with the case officer. The station has found it desirable to meet him with greater frequency than heretofore and to provide understanding (rather than sympathy), interest, encouragement but restrict all guidance, and apply a steady checkrein to what are mostly rather wild ideas. Attachment A is a clear example of the type of activity WIRCOUE tends to undertake if left on his own and the security risk he represents in such situations.

3. In addition, WIRCOUE's attitude and responsibility to rid money leaves much to be desired. Headquarters' comment in Ref. concerning WIRCOUE's "propensity for financial mismanagement" is fully realized by this station. To recount WIRCOUE's financial misadventures briefly, he spent his money lavishly upon arrival, rented an extra apart-ment he didn't need, besides several stores for which he was not prepared-to-use, has bought and sold at least three cars and is currently driving a large Chrysler (in spite of being told at the time that it was far too conspicuous). When having depleted the original SACOI Commel to him, he requested his $3000 housing allowance in one lump sum. He now accedes to the fact that he will receive the housing allowance in "little dribbles" (his words), but still feels that he was told he would get it in a lump sum payment. He has little to show from his initial loan for setting up a business, and even if provided with all necessary equipment he could probably not follow through without additional financial backing. The Station feels that no matter how much money he is provided, WIRCOUE would manage to get into financial difficulties or at least spend all that he had available.

4. On 4 March 1962, WIRCOUE telephoned and wished someone to meet him immediately. He explained, at the meeting, that at [REDACTED] meeting before he had met.

(WIROGUE typically referred to PIERROT as "the major" and said that he didn't remember his name. Later, WIROGUE, in spite of being briefed otherwise, continued to fail to obtain names of people with whom he dealt.) WIROGUE was to meet PIERROT the evening of 5 March at 1700 to discuss the possibility and details of his becoming administrative liaison officer under contract to the Congolese Air Force. PIERROT is interested in developing his own cadre of instructors, both for flying and mechanical work, to develop further the embryo group of 150 cadets currently more or less ready for flying training.

5. At meetings held 5 and 6 March WIROGUE supplied the following details concerning his new jobs he was to meet the Minister of National Defense ad interim, Fernand KASADI, on 7 March to sign a contract. He finally did meet KASADI (whom WIROGUE knows only as M. le Ministre), on 9 March but no contract was yet signed. As of 15 March WIROGUE had not yet signed a contract but this is pending, he tells us, any day. (A copy of this contract will be forwarded to Headquarters when obtained.) The terms of the agreement include, he states, that he will provide through his European contacts at least three pilot instructors and three mechanic instructors within thirty days. (Thirty days from when is an open question.) More instructors will be needed at a later date, the possible total number being set at ten, five for flying and five for mechanical instruction. These instructors will be paid 20,000 Belgian Congo Francs a month plus 10,000 BCF bonus. WIROGUE will receive 25,000 BCF and 10,000 BCF bonus each month, with housing to be supplied in all cases. If the instructors have families, family transport in addition to their sum will be provided by the Congolese Government. In addition, medical care and a fifteen day vacation each year is to be provided. The work week is to consist of a 5 1/2 day week.

6. WIROGUE has said that he is totally dependent upon KUBARK support to supply the needed instructors. He also feels he must provide documentation to prove he is an ex-captain in the German Army and is quite anxious concerning this point. (Answered by para 3, Ref 1.). WIROGUE also feels that the instructors should be other than PEPRIME in order to better back up his cover story, since PEPRIME instructors might point the finger of suspicion in his direction. One or two PEPREME candidates, however could be included providing a proper cover story were provided. WIROGUE needs names of candidates as quickly as possible, though a dummy list of names "to whom he has written" can be supplied if either PIERROT or KASADI become too insistent, all candidates must be French speaking. In addition, WIROGUE needs a good 35 mm. camera and feels that this was promised to him, with other equipment, and though his targeting has shifted he still has great use for it. Currently WIROGUE has one of the station Leica's on short loan in order to photograph the Ndolo Airport facilities for PIERROT.

7. Recruited instructors should be provided a means of outside contact with the Station separate from WIROGUE, which could be implemented if needed, at a later date. The actual hiring and correspondence relating to their contracts should be sent over to WIROGUE as though he were handling the entire matter himself on behalf of the Congolese government. The address which should be used for all correspondence on an overt basis is included with this dispatch as Attachment B, with the title of Major preceding the name provided in Attachment A of ACLW-192.

8. With a set salary from the Congolese Government, it is WIROGUE'S wish to commence repayment of the $4,000 loan made to him for his business. Also, this particular situation could be fairly short-lived in view of United Nation's offer to the Air Force to assist in Congolese Air Force training. It is obvious that PIERROT and the Congolese Government are trying to develop several sources at once to guarantee training for their embryo Air arm, and the final outcome is difficult to determine. The Station is also aware that PIERROT and KALADI could be using WIROGUE at this juncture to obtain instructors for the air force, but might ease him out.

of their own accord later on, either deeming him not worth keeing be- cause he is not a profe sionsi airman, or bec.use he will have done something to antagonize them. Also, the Station or Headquarters my deem it advisable to ease him out of this job, us Headquarters has suggested in Ref A, after he has provider in entree for putting some instructors on the scene We believe this situation represents a worthwhile gain, however, if HIROGUS does obtain the contract as presently constituted.

9. Attachment C provides some information concerning Paul Arnold PIERROT and the Congolese Air Force which was provided by the Air Attache, Leopoldville, and which has already been reported through their channels. PIERROT is obviously trying to develop a training program ind build up the Congolese Air Force from several sources at once, and if several of these sources provide the desired aid it is debatable if his om program (with WIROGUE) would become very extensive or eve:: be imple- mented It is also possible that WIROGUE's role in the training picture could shift at any time. We feel that at this time we can only go along with developments as they occur and try to realize the maximum benefit from the situation Headquarters will be kept informed of any changes in the situation, and be provided more specific data when avail- able.

10. In all fairness to WIROGUE, it should be pointed out that until recently the station has not had the time to properly target WIRO- GUE As he appears to be untrained in KUPUES and KUCAGE operations, he requires a great deal of case officer time, an item which is in short supply in this station. We believe WIPOGUE may develop into a worth- while asset, if the time and attention he requires can be spent on him, however. The station is taking the appropriate steps in this direction.

SUBJECT: Paul Arnold PIERROT - Background Information provided by Air Attache, Leopoldville

1 N' DOLO airport is currently being evacuated by the U.N.O.C. forces and turned over to the Congolese government for use by the Congolese Bir Force There are some 150 cadet's who have received some training and are considered ready for advanced training, but as of this time, have nowhere to be trained PIERROT has made extensive efforts to obtain aid from many sources to train these cadets The AIRA reports that FIERECT has requested aid from the Belgians, the British, United Nations, and asked the AIRA to request aid from the French for the Congolese Air Force. About 30 cadets are in training in Tunisia at the present time. Cn 11 March the AIRA recommended aid be extended to the Congolese Air Force, but under the auspices of the United Nations.

2 PIERROT also reported 11 March that he had 6 Noth and 9 Harvard T-6 aircraft being delivered near the end of March, and asked if the United Nations Command would allow them to enter the Congo He even offered to let the planes remain under U.N. control.

3. PIERROT is a mulatto and claims to have a white grandmother in Dallas, Texas He was trained by the Belgians and claims to have flown C-47's and T-33 jet planes, though he has not been on flying sta- tus since 1956 due to goiter trouble At this time accurate bio data is not availalbe His assistant is Lt K.J. LEKAN who is reportedly completely devcted to PIERRCT. PIERROT is personally ambitious and at one point in the fall of 1960, he approached TFELIDE authorities with a plan to take over the government if they would help him His plan was too transparent and weak for any serious consideration at that time

14 May 1962

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:

Subj: RIBBON

Subject was originally considered for a RIBBON project that was subsequently cancelled. Throughout the file are recommendations that in dealing with the subject any station should assert very definite authority. For example, the recommendation of CCB Frankfurt, 13/11/58:

"The handling of subject from this point on must be ruthless and calculated...We would recommend against paying $ more than the absolute minimum he needs to survive until the mission is completed"

On 20 September 1950 Africa Division picked subject up for an assignment in the Congo. In conjunction with this mission, subject was furnished Austrian documentation, which, according to a Dir communication dated 22 November 1950, was to be used in order to travel from West Germany to Leo via Switzerland & Italy, and should be returned when no longer needed.

The Director's communication to Leo again reiterated that subject would take firm orders and should be dealt with in a positive manner. Unfortunately, shortly after arriving in the Congo subject got into financial difficulty, created security problems with his conduct, and then jumped into a new position with the CAF that moved so swiftly as to preclude any effective station direction.

On 30 June 1951 the Director recommended termination of subject since he was becoming too great a security risk. Subject was returned to the U.S., then was sent back to Frankfurt, given $2,000.00 pay and put on his own. There was no indication of any hard feelings on the part of the subject but it is admitted that he "wondered" why he was let go.

On 20 September 1951 subject turned up on his own in the Congo and began to approach station personnel with offers of help, no matter what the station wanted or where they wanted him. On 12 December 1951 the station admitted that subject is a security hazard of sorts and asked for some direction.

The Security Division at Headquarters states that the documentation originally furnished subject were irretrievably retrieved by him since he had no other citizenship papers. Once these documents run out it will be impossible for him to renew them.

In the light of the generous termination terms, in the repeated statements to subject that KU ARK could not utilize his services, and the possible security hazard, it would seem best to completely sever any relationships with him. Judging from the psychiatric opinion, as well as opinions of personnel who have worked with subject, he fully understands and will not question stern authority.

211-233477


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

SECRET

For this reason it is recorriended that either one of the two following courses of action may be taken, preferably the first.

1. In very unequivocal language infom subject that his official connection to the U.. interests in the Congo have been and continue to. This apprehension (if for nothing else for pos essing forged documents). Instruct him that he clearly understood that his relationship with this organization could be terminated under the terms of the contract and although we are appreciative of his past efforts, he is now on his om.

2. Bring him back to the U.S. and go for rd with the original plan to resettle subject in Mexico. He made preliminary inquiries about this possibility 19 August 1950 before he came with Africa Division and the only thing that stopped the transfer plans was the posibility that he could be used in the Congo.

Solution number one runs the risk of having subject get disgruntled, and then ruming to the wrong people to tell all he inous. On the other hand, if the man reacts to direction as we are told he does this may be all that he needs to stay cler of the station. It is apparent that et some point in time he has to be given the gate.

Solution na ber to runs into the financial problen as well as dealing with an individual he is no lom or commected with this org mization. However, it does met one of the "remirements" laid down by the COD in Frankfurt back in 1955, ie., "Givon some money and a job he could be resettled in any South American country without difficulty". The second colution is inviting, if for no other reason, in terms of getting subject out of a'r ther iifficult area.

3. The 3rd possibility is to bring him directly to a 3nd country + take the documents away from him there - then tell him he is on his own.

RE 05-3 - (CHECK ONE)

X: MARKED FOR INDEXING

REFERENCE:

1.  The recent purchase of three DC-3's and a DC-4 by the Congolese government is having continuing repercussions. This deal has been reported in detail through both *TAELINE* and *ODUMIT* channels including the accusations of substantial graft which accompanied it. The most recent developments, however, have not yet, to the Station's knowledge, been reported by either of the above channel.

2.  *STAHL* reported to *HESTON* in a meeting 28 February that *WIROGUE* is back with the Congolese Air Force. *STAHL* described him as an Austrian with a belgian passport, formerly with the German commandos, who knows nothing about aviation. *STAHL* continued to say:

Major Peter DE GROEVE (Advisor to Congolese Air Force ca. February 61 - March 62. Belgian. Involved in purchase three DC-3 planes from Iran Airways at price $125,000 per aircraft. Competent authorities stated comparable aircraft could be purchased $50,000 to $60,000 and predicted trouble from purchases.)

left the Congo with 14,000 pounds which, supposedly, was his share of some $140,000 reputedly made on the above airplane purchases. According to *STAHL*, DE GROEVE bribed someone at the *Surete* who then let him cross safely to Brazzaville.

3.  On 30 March *WIROGUE* informed *SALVACK* that the GOC had put him in charge of investigating the above airplane purchases. His first real task is to arrest DE GROEVE and bring him back to the Congo. Congo (Brazza), however, refuses to cooperate and told *WIROGUE* when he queried them that DE GROEVE had requested political refuge. Besides, *WIROGUE* felt, the Brazza side of the river would be very healtant to return a white man to the tender mercies of the Congolese in Leopoldville. DE GROEVE is supposedly in Pointe Noire waiting for a French ship to take him to Marseilles, a voyage of some 20 days. *WIROGUE* is currently toying with various ideas for possibly kidnapping DE GROEVE in Pointe Noire.

4.  Both *WIROGUE* and *STAHL* said DE GROEVE is wanted for rape in Belgium. *WIROGUE* said he had also stolen some money there, though *STAHL's* version was that DE GROEVE had debts amounting to 400,000 Belgian francs. In either case, it is doubtful that DE GROEVE will return to belgium.

1. VIROGUE CONTACTS STATION AT PERIODIC INTERVALS. 19 MARCH V APPEARED DISCOURAGED AND A LITTLE DESPERATE. HE STILL WORKS FOR CONGOLESE AIR FORCE, MAKING 15,000 BCF PER MONTH. SAYS HE NEEDS MORE JUST TO LIVE. FEELS KUBARK USED HIM UNFAIRLY. WANTS TRAVEL GERMANY AND ITALY TO TRY MAKE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING HIS INVENTIONS. ALSO WOULD SEARCH FOR ANOTHER JOB. SAID HE STILL OWNS CAR FOR WHICH HE THINKS HE CAN GET ABOUT 260,000 BCF TO COVER COST TRIP.

2. STATION CONCERNED BY W PRESENCE LEOP AND POSSIBILITY HE COULD, IF FINANCIAL SITUATION BECOMES SUFFICIENTLY DESPERATE. WORK FOR ANOTHER SERVICE. DOUBT HE WOULD COOPERATE WITH BLOC SERVICES BUT CANNOT BE CERTAIN. ALSO THERE IS POSSIBILITY HE MIGHT WORK FOR SMOTH, UNION, WIROOT, ETC. LEOP DOES NOT BELIEVE HE HAS YET TURNED TO OTHER SERVICES. APPEARS HOPE KUBARK WILL AGAIN TAKE HIM ON. (IN DISCUSSING DESIRE GO GERMANY SAID HE WOULD LIKE MEET WITH KUBARKER TO DETERMINE IF ANY JOB AVAILABLE FOR HIM. SALVACK FINESSED DIRECT REPLY THIS POINT BUT SAID LEOP NOT ABLE DO ANY MORE FOR HIM THAN ADVISE HQS OF HIS DESIRE.)

3. IF CONVERTING MONEY WOULD GET HIM OUT OF LEOP PERMANENTLY STATION WOULD RECOMMEND MONEY REALIZED FRONCAR SALE BE CONVERTED AT CURRENT STATION RATE OF 125 BCF TO ONE DOLLAR. THIS WOULD GIVE VABOUT 2,003 DOLLARS WHILE CONVERSION AT OPEN MARKET RATE VOULD GIVE HIM ONLY ABOUT 1400 DOLLARS. HOWEVER STATED HE LIKES CONGO AND IF THINGS DID NOT GO VELL FOR HIM IN EUROPE HE WOULD PROBABLY RETURN LEOP. THUS COURTESY CONVERSION FOR U WOULD PROVIDE NO GUARANTEE HE WOULD NOT RETURN LATER AS LONG AS CARRYING FALSE KUBARK.

DOCUMENTATION HE WILL CONTINUE BE PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH KUBARK NO LONGER HAS OBLIGATION TO V, FACT HE IN CONGO ON KUBARK FALSE PAPERS CONTINUES MAKE HIM OUR BABY. (SHOULD CONGOLESE BECOME SUSPICIOUS AND TRACE HIM OR SHOULD ANOTHER SERVICE CHECK WITH AUSTRIAN OFFICIALS AND DETERMINE HE TRAVELLING ON FALSE PAPERS, THIS WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY LEAD TO HIS ARREST. IN SUCH A CASE HE MIGHT REVEAL SOURCE OF DOCUMANTATION.)

4. BASIS LOCAL EXPERIENCE WITH CANNOT RECOMMEND HIM FOR ANOTHER KUBARK ASSIGNMENT DESPITE FACT HE CLAINS WANTS BE OF SERVICE ODYOKE, HOWEVER, OUR DILEMMA IS FACT HIS PRESENCE CONTINUES BE POTENTIAL SECURITY HAZARD. WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HOS ADVICE RE POSSIBLE SOLUTION. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE CONVERT MONEY AT STATION RATE AND HAVE KUBARK GERMANY PICK UP HIS DOCUMENTATION WHILE HE IN GERMANY. THIS WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING CONGO AS VOULD NO LONGER HAVE DOCUMENTATION IN NAME UNDER WHICH ΜΕ ΝΟΥ LIVING IN CONGO. HOWEVER, THIS COULD ANGER V AND CAUSE HIN REVEAL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

INFO Chief, 86

FROM Chief of Station, Leopoldvillo

SUBJECT ZIBST/WIROGUE

ACTION REQUIRED FYI

REFERENCES:

A. DIR 25730

B. ACLA 630 dated 19 October 1961

1. On 29 November 1961 WIROGUE told the undersigned that he felt his position vis-a-vis the Congolese Government was rapidly weakening. First, WIROGUE had endorsed sending one of the advisors with the Congolese Air Force to Burope to purchase planes and later found WIGARD/4 was at least cognizant of a second GOC representative sent to Surope on the same mission. WIROGUR made vague references to some 2,000,000 Congolese Francs of the 40,000,000 available for airplane purchases "going into someone's pocket." WIROGUE vas incensed at the move of the GOC in sending a parallel mission to Europe and not informing him of it. He saw WIZARD/2 and asked about this other mission. WIZARD/2 apparently informed WIZARD/4 about WIROGUE's visit and since then, for a period of the last five days, WIZARD/4 hes refused to see or talk to WIROGUE.

2. The GOC has also apparently proposed sending HIROGUE on an intelligence gathering mission to Katanga. WIROGUE asked if KUBARK were interested in this undertaking. We advised him strongly against this move and added we had no interest whatsoever in the project.

3. HIROGUS has also met the ODOATH representative and showed him the model submarine which was the subject of ACLA-630. The ODCATH representative evinced interest in this model and through the ODUNIT representative, whoin WIROGUE has seen on several occasions and discussed.. the problem of purchasing planes for the GOC, the ODOATH representative was aware that WIKOGUS has an Ordre de Mission signed by WIZARD/2 to... travel to PEPIMS. He said for WIROGUE to inform him when he was ready to depart and he would arrange for WIROGUE to contact appropriate ODOATH people in PRPRIME to discuss the model.

4. WIROGUE approached GUTHMAN on November 24 and SALVACK on November 29 with a request whether he might be of use to KUBARK either in Africa or elsewhere in the world, and that he would like to be taken back into the fold. He is obviously concerned about his position in the GOC at this time and feels with the diplomatic relations being established between Belgium and the GOC that his position will become increasingly weaker. To reemphasize past assessments of WIROGUE, he is far too disorganized an individual to be an effective FI agent but would probably be useful where action is required but detailed accurate reporting is not. The station agrees with an early statement made concerning WIROGUE that he has a peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of an action type.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief,

FROM: Chief of Station, Leopoldville

SUBJECT: NIMLT/WIROGUE Request for Documents

ACTION REQUIRED: Hqs Guidance re model (para 5)

DATE: 19 October 1961

1.  On 2 October 1961 WIROGUE telephoned Lester H. SALVACK and said that he had something important to discuss with him. WIROGUE requested SALVACK to come to his house in Binza, a suburb of Léopoldville.

2.  WIROGUE had two requests. The first was to ask "Dan" to forward the two laissez-passez which WIROGUE states he turned over to Dan and never got back. WIROGUE was quite emphatic that he needs these documents. SALVACK suggested that WIROGUE write a note stating exactly what he wanted and give it to him to forward. WIROGUE did and the note is forwarded as a separate cover attachment to this dispatch.

3.  WIROGUE then showed SALVACK a model of a one man submarine on which he had been working in conjunction with a Belgian engineer (Identity #1) who is also a Congolese Air Force advisor. He claimed that this submarine would be capable of speeds up to 100 kilometers an hour on short runs, and would have a cruising distance of 500 kilometers. The model, being built to 1/7 scale, is approximately half completed, and, of course, has never been tested. WIROGUE said he had discussed this model and his plans fully when in Headquarters, and had made a full report concerning all details. SALVACK said that (1) he was not an engineer and (2) was in no position to make any promise or commitment. All that he could do was to report that the model was in the process of construction and to further report that WIROGUE wanted to make sure that the West got it instead of the Communist bloc.

4.  WIROGUE expressed full willingness to show the model, and have his companion explain it fully, to anyone SALVACK wished to bring to WIROGUE's house. SALVACK made no commitment other than to report the conversation. (It should be noted that WIROGUE had never mentioned this item before to Station personnel, and told Salvack that neither he nor his companion had said anything to anyone in The Congo concerning it up to this point.)

5.  If Headquarters is willing, the station suggests that the ODODH attache be put into contact with WIROGUE concerning this item. He could conduct any necessary tests or experiments. Because of WIROGUE's past, however, and the nature of his documentation, the Station requests Headquarters guidance and approval prior to taking any action.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

6. On returning to the Congo crossed the Congo river from Brazzaville successfully in spite of the ferries being closed to all out diplomatic travel, but it involved a prolonged argument for more than an hour with the immigration authorities at the ferry landing. ROGUS has never fully admitted what he did to successfully enter The Congo, though knowing the situation, he probably indulged in some small bribery. Since he had merely disappeared for a short while after mentioning that he might need medical attention, his Congolese Air Force job was still open. (There are many advisory positions vacant, and for someone to obtain such a position with any sort of cualifications is not too difficult. When a position is vacated it is seldom refilled, certainly not quickly.) He has reiterated strongly at each of the three meetings SALVAC has had with him that he is willing to help PBPRINE any way possible.

The sum of 42,500 SCP from the sale of his automobile plus 11,580 BCF converted at 50/$1.00 (LOP-1599 end DIR-49325) gave WIROGUE a credit of $1,051.60. In Jarvary 1961 WIROGUE was ordered to Thysville by the Station and was authorized $0.10 per mile for use of his personal car, therefore, 312.5 miles times $0.10 equals $31. leaving WIROGUS a credit of U. S.. $1,112.85. (See attachment).

3. IROGUE was paid his June salary of $500 on 26 June and also his housing for July ($250.00). (Station was notified on 1 July, DIR-48429 that WIROGUE was to return to PSPRIPE). However, July rental was used in the final settlement of the lease for the usual damages claimed by local landlords and in lieu of 30 days termination notice. Receipt forwarded under Voucher: 1153.

4. Accountability in the amount of E. S. $100.00 is herewith transferred to Headquarters plus a credit of $1,112.85. AS WIROGUE was specifically told he would have to account for the above $100.00 for livi:g/traveling expenses Station did not subtract that amount from his credit.

B. Operational Information:

1. Circumstances of Recruitment

The agent was first contacted in October 1958 as a result of a lead
from AEPADDLE. He was recruited in April 1959 by the Frankfurt Station,
for a REDSOX operation. There had been some difficulty in the initial
recruitment, since it could not be resolved as to whether or not he
could work amicably with another agent in the proposed operation. Af-
ter psychological assessments and LCTLUTIER examination, it was decided
to recruit subject. He was assigned the crypto AEASPIC. In April 1959
subject was brought to the DOB, via a HORAINDOW flight. Subject was
trained in the AESENTIAL project for a black mission into the USSR as a
member of a REDSOX team. This project was postponed for a year. In
the interim he was assigned to TED, where he was employed at a covert
site, involving the cataloguing of specific information from East
German Documents, and developing and/or improving tools and methods for
picking locks. On 17 June 1960, it was decided that Project AESENTTEEL
would not be carried out. On receipt of this information SR/DOB en-
deavored to place subject elsewhere, where his training would be bene-
ficial. The African Division expressed interest and had agreed to uti-
lize him as a result of assessments. During the period from the 21st
of October until dispatch, subject will be carried on OOA funds.

Subject was brought to Berlin where he was interrogated for several months at Gestapo Headquarters. Later he was tried and sentenced to death. For some unknown reason he was moved from jail to jail, concentration camp to concentration camp. While in prison he resorted to a "ruse de guerra" and told the Germans his father had invented a motor that could run without gasoline. He offered to draw the designs of the motor and was able to stall long enough to be liberated by components of the advancing U.S. Army.

B. In 1946-47 subject and an accomplice committed two robberies of jewelry stores.

C. In 1949 subject robbed a bank of 1,000,000 Fr. fr. His accomplice was apprehended and shortly thereafter confessed, implicating subject. Subject was apprehended while attempting to cross the Franco-Spanish border. He was sentenced to ten years in prison of which he served only five, receiving parole for good behavior. Upon release in 1955, he was exiled on parole to Gap, France where he worked as an architect.

D. To our knowledge there is no indication that subject is known to be associated with KUBARK.

Subject: Trip to Congo

Dear Stan,

Just a brief rundown on the Congo business. I arrived on time following Foarer and of course it was a holiday so did not and was not contacted until the following day (Tuesday). By that I had an agreement ready and in one hands on the Congolese. I met with the minister of him and he indicated all was in order and that the papers would be signed the following day (Friday). On Friday nothing happened so we created out Saturday, again nothing happened so there was nothing to do but wait until Monday. By this time I had talked with Sabena and got a free ticket on them from Leopoldville to Brussels so that I'd have more flexibility. On Monday there was still no action and again gave them the benefit of the doubt by remaining until Tuesday when I could have gotten a 707 flight on Monday night direct to Brussels. On Tuesday I left Leopoldville in the afternoon, proceeded to Brazzaville and that waited 10 hours for the delayed KLM flight (00-7), finally leaving at 3 AM and arriving in Frankfurt at 1900 that night.

As I told you, Major Reiner is an Austrian who acts as an adviser to the Congolese Air Force. Major Pierrott, commander of the air force is young and ambitious. At the present time there is nothing but a shell and instructors are badly needed. There are, according to Pierrott, 4 AT-6's and 2 Tiger Moths on order which will give them a total strength of 9 of each aircraft. They expect to put a total of 120 cadets into training. I talked along the lines of a package deal on training but this didn't sink in. They just want to get started and go in to detail later. As you can well imagine, the government structure in the Congo is very shaky and it will be a long time before the U.N. forces leave and things settle in a normal manner. For example, there could be a change in the govt., including Pierrott, any day and this could be followed by any number of changes in the weeks following. Any contract we sign could be thrown out by a new government. In addition there is also one possibility of renewed violence which might throw everything in a turmoil.

Without going in to detail, following are the more important points of the agreement:

1. Air Force retain us for purpose of hiring personnel for purpose of training mechanic and pilot personnel.

2. Air Force have transportation of personnel from point of hire to Leopoldville and return plus air travel done in the Congo.

3. Air Force pays (to the bank in Ely) $1,000.00 for my expenses such payment to made within 20 days after signing agreement.

4. Initially, 3 mechanic and 3 pilot instructors will be hired and Air Force will accept persons of German, Swiss, French or English nationality.

5. Pay of personnel will be responsibility of Air Force and mechanics will receive $770.00 or $650.00 plus room. Pilots will receive $870.00 or plus flying pay which is figured at $50.00 for each 25 hours flown (they anticipate pilots will fly 75 hours per month) or $750 plus room plus flying pay. In addition, all personnel will be furnished their noon meal except on weekends when they are not working.

6. Personnel will be able to transfer one half of their pay to country of residence---this figures out at $385.00 and $435.00 re-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 125

fee or 10% each month on total
G. Air Force will pay us $4,000 each month on total salaries of employees. It was agreed that individual salaries would average at $650.00 each. This payment to be made on the first of each month by transfer to the Sly bank.
G. We obtain insurance in amount of Sterling 3500 for each employee and Air Force pay the actual cost.

10. 
As you can see, it is a simple agreement and one which will not make us rich. They indicated they would want one film strip machine and available training films for mechanics and pilots.

It appears that there will be a great deal of B&K contract flying for the “10” in the Congo for some time to come. As I told you, Interocean and TIA are doing the most with Interocean having six DC-6’s flying 1500 hours per month and TMA doing nearly 500 with two aircraft. TMA will pull their aircraft out in the next few days for the Wet and it would seem that your man in New York might be able to work something out whereby we could replace them and remain in the Congo.

Living accommodations are good in Leopoldville. Villas rent from $1,000.00 on up with a nice place for about $175.00. This would be a three or four bedroom place with all the facilities. If we had crews there, they could live together as I'm sure none of them would want to take families. Food is expensive but no more so than in Tripoli. Cor, gasoline sells at a little over 40 cents a gallon which isn't bad. Nothing is being imported in to the country so cigarettes are not available and Belgian brands are not plentiful. There is a money black market for hard currency and you can get anywhere from 65 to 90 Congo francs for a dollar whereas the legal rate of exchange is 50 to a dollar. The time correspondent was caught changing money and the Embassy had quite a time getting the thing straightened out.

Under ordinary circumstances (except for contracting with the Iraqi's I wouldn't think of signing a contract with the Congolese Govt.). However, with things as they stand the B&K brand this is a road way to get our foot in the door and could open up another field in West Africa. Perhaps Carma would like to make a trip out that way as our representative!!!!

Wish the situation in Amman were better---I'll give you as much done as possible after my arrival. I've heard nothing more from the Congo so will probably be leaving on Monday for Cairo.

Best regards,
Fully

# GENERAL INFORMATION TO BE NOTED

Subject was issued the following documents:

1.  Austrian (Ordinary) Passport Nr. 546.226 in Vienna at the main Passport Office located in Wien I, Postgasse 9, which is near the main Post Office and also near Schwedenplatz. As noted in the passport entries, document was issued in 1955 and was valid until 1960, when it was again renewed for another five years. The lack of exit and entry cachets of very frequent travel to Germany and Berlin is explained by the fact that generally since late 1955 Austrians entering Germany no longer were stamped in or out. For this reason, Subject can claim that he made many trips to Germany and back each time remaining as long as three months without special permits. (Austrians need a residence permit only when they remain more than three months at one time.) As noted above, that passport was first issued by the main Passport office, however, the reneval vas obtained at a sub station, Wien IV, Taubstummengasse 11. This can be explained by the fact that at that time subject lived in that part of Vienna after he returned from Berlin.

2.  Austrian Drivers Permit:

This document was obtained in Vienna in 1956 and is valid for an indefinite time. Section B, which is not crossed out indicates that he is authorized to drive ordinary private cars not in excess of 3500 kg. (No trucks etc.) Reverse left hand portion shows fee stamp of 6 schilling has been paid. Normally this section also indicates authority on which permit was issued, but since this is his first permit no such entry is made.

3.  International Certificate of Vaccination:

When subject contemplated travel outside Europe, he felt it best to obtain a vaccination certificate normally required in many countries. He could have obtained the blank document from a travel agency who directed him to go and have proper entries made for smallpox and yellow fever. At the suggestion of the travel agency he went to see Dr. Ladislaus Tomsich, General Practitioner, Wien III, Marokkanergasse 133. This Doctor, had the necessary vaccines for smallpox and yellow fever and he took both vaccines on 12 November 1959. Smallpox vaccinations are generally valid for three years. The yellow fever shots are good for 6 years.

4.  Baptismal Certificate:

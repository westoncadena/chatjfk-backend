Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV: He is a 38-year-old officer of the KGB who occupies the cover position of Second Secretary. He first visited Mexico in 1959 for a Soviet Industrial Exposition and later came from September 1961 until August 1965. He returned again in September 1968 to replace another KGB officer.

KOSTIKOV is considered to be one of the most effective and dangerous of the intelligence officers in Mexico. He has had a wide range of responsibilities which have included operations among emigre groups in western Mexico, operations directed against the United States and currently against the governments of Central America. He presently meets with exiles from Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras. He is known to have passed funds to these groups as well as tactical guidance.

SUBJECT: LIARENA/REDLEG/Confirmation of Contact between Valery KOSTIKOV (201-305052)

and Guatemalan Communist Party Representative in Mexico

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES: Action Required: None, FYI.

References: A. HMMA-38449, 10 February 1970.

B. MEXICO CITY 2303, 21 January 1970.

1. On 10 February 1970 LIREBEL-2 provided the details of his 6 February meeting with Jose Luis BALCARCEL Ordonez ((201-160430) leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party (FGT) exile organization in Mexico. LIREBEL-2 reported that he arrived at BALCARCEL's home at 2000 hours on the ein, and found BALCARCEL about to leave. BALCARCEL requested that LIREBEL-2 take him to a garage where his car was being repaired, which LIREBEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car was not ready, BALCARCEL asked LIREBEL-2 to drive him to a meeting which he had scheduled for 2100 hours with his "Soviet contact." (Note: BALCARCEL had previously told LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet Embassy.) LIREBEL-2 and BALCARCEL drove to the "Parque Escondido," also known as the "Parque Hundido," located on Insurgentes Sur between Gomez Farias and Millet Streets. LIREBEL-2 parked and BALCARCEL held his meeting with his "Soviet contact" standing on the sidewalk of Gomez Farias Street bordering on the park. The meeting lasted for 30 minutes.

2. BALCARCEL commented after re-joining LIREBEL-2 that his "Soviet contact" had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received from a Guatemalan student. The student had asked to talk to the Soviet by true name and asked him for some information on the Soviet national soccer team, which is scheduled to play some games in Guatemala. The Soviet told BALCARCEL that he had told the student that he could not provide any current information on this subject, and that the student should try to get this information from El Salvador, where the team was to play some games prior to their arrival in Quatemala. BALCARCEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for him by true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (AEU) leader who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving his name out to unauthorized persons.

3. Addressees will recall that per Reference A, LIENVOY reported that KOSTIKOV received a long distance call on 6 February in which the conversation conformed exactly to that described by BALCARCEL to LIKEPEL-2 in paragraph 2 above.

4. It is of interest to note that past contact with KOSTIKOV setting up clandestine contacts with Alejandro RODRIGUEZ Kergia (201-062689), leader of the Nicarea Communist Party exile organization in Mexico, and similarly with Lorenz ZELAYA Romero (201-045172), a Homuran Communist in Mexico. By virtue of these contacts, it appears that at least one of KOSTIKOV's responsibilities is maintaining contact with representatives of Central American Communist Parties in Mexico.

FROM: Acting Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: Phone Call from AKU Representative to Valery KOSTIKOV

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES
Action Required: None, FYI.

Reference: MEXICO CITY 2303, 21 January 1970

1. LIENVOY reported that on 6 February 1970 Valery KOSTIKOV (201-305052), 2nd Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, received a long-distance telephone call from Guatemala. The operator asked for KOSTIKOV by name, then told the caller "Mr. MONTENEGRO, I have your call to Mexico ready". When KOSTIKOV came to the phone, the caller stated he was calling on behalf of the Guatemalan University Students Organization, but did not further identify himself. The caller and KOSTIKOV discussed the USSR national soccer team and its scheduled appearance in Guatemala. KOSTIKOV stated he was not certain exactly what date the team was scheduled to arrive in Guatemala, and suggested that the caller contact the soccer federation in El Salvador, where the team would be playing prior to its arrival in Guatemala. The caller also inquired whether there was any information on the Ballet (Reference) and was told that there was none.

2. It should be noted that normally queries concerning the Soviet soccer team or the appearance of a Russian Ballet troupe would be handled by one of the Cultural or Sports Affairs officers of the Embassy. KOSTIKOV's participation in these matters, as reported above, would seem to confirm previous Station reporting that KOSTIKOV handles dealings between the Soviet Embassy in Mexico and Guatemalan leftist organizations.

BALCARCEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for him by true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (AEU) leader who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving his name out to unauthorised persons.

3. Addressees will recall that per deference A, LIMVOY reported that KOSTIKOV received a long distance call on 6 February in which the creation conformed exactly to that described by BALCARCEL to LIREBEL-2 in paragraph 2 above.

4. It is of interest to note that past LIENVOY reporting has shown KOSTIKOV setting up clandestine contacts with Alejandro BERAUDEZ Alegria (201-062683), leader of the Nicaraguan Communist Party exile organization in Mexico, and similarly with lorenzo ZELAYA Romero (201-045172), a Honduran Communist in Mexico. By virtue of these contacts, it appears that at least one of KOSTIKOV's responsibilities is maintaining contact with representatives of Central Aerican Communist Parties in Mexico.

LISACK Progress Report, 1 July - 30 September 1969

Reference: HMMA-37451, 1 July 1969

## 1. Operations

Under this roof project, operations continue to be directed against the NIMARSH target and, on occasions, Bloc targets. Activities covered by the Project include providing information on NIMARSHers, their activities, personalities, visitors, and contacts (LISACK-2, -4, -6, and LICOWL-1); serving as access agents (LICAVE-1, -2, -3, LIROCKET-1, and BESABER); spotting, assessing and occasionally recruiting access agents (LIMPTY-3); providing information on DILET activities (DPLTAL-1) and DEDOX activities (BESABER); and performing such other tasks as may be required on an *ad hoc* basis (LISACK-7 and all other assets of the Project).

## 2. Administration

As assets take on a permanent character in terms of expenditure or other continuing administration, they are transferred from SB/OOA to LISACK for orderly handling. Beginning with this reporting period, and as outlined in the LISACK Project Renewal, BESABER, DMPETAL, and LICOWL-1 were transferred from SB/OCA to LISACK. Details of the functions, security, and meeting procedures are reported below for each asset.

## 3. Assets

**a.** LICRAVE-1, -2, and -3: The activities of these assets have been covered in detail in recent and continuing correspon-dence dealing with AΣΤAKEOFF. Please See A-38364 of 5 November 1969.

**b.** BESABER: During the reporting period, EESABER was met six times. When he travels to Mexico City, meetings are held in his hotel room at a pre-arranged hour using a telephone code to establish the location. On occasions, he is net at his home in Cuernavaca. DESADER is currently targetted against Subject of 201-268115, with whom he has re-established a good social relationship. Through Subject of 201-268115 he also met Subject of 201-276184, Chief of the Referentura. In addition to serving as an access agent to Subject of 201-268115, he has fulfilled spot requirements such as providing information on Centro Intercultural de Documentacion (CIDOC) and personalities of Station interest. Although BESABER has a fairly good social relationship with the BEDOX Ambassador and his wife and has entree to other DEDOXers and 19AP.Silers, wo are having him concentrate his efforts on the higher priority MILIARSHer, Subject of 201-260115.

**c.** LICOWL-1: He was met routinely once a month during the reporting period. Each reeting date is established at the preceding meeting and no further contact or confirmation is required. LICOWL-1 arrives by bus at a car pick-up point and is then driven by the case officer to a small coffee shop where he reviews his diary with the case officer. Due to the nature of his job and the level of his access, LICO Lelis not in a position to do core currently than to report on the brief encounters he has with HIUHARSHers who come into his store. Ilis reports normally consist of his assessment of personalitics, description of new arrivals and, occasionally, biographic information he has been able to pick up. He also gives timely reports of demonstrations and other unusual activity in the vicinity of the MIFARSIH installation.

**d.** LIEMPTY-3: LIEMPTY-3 is met at irregular intervals at various out-of-the-way restaurants for the purpose of briefing and debriefing on operational assignments and discussion of his written reports. Neetings are arranged by phone using open code. His most recent assignment has been the development.,. assessment, and recruitment of 201-810931. LIEMPTY-3 has few peers at the art of developing an operational lead, but his extensive operational activity in past years against the ITMARSA target has required that he be used sparingly, selectively, and always under alias. Development of 201-810981 has been his only assignment during the reporting period, and LIEPTY-3 made good early progress. Purporting to be the representative of a film club for architects, LIEMPTY-3 was able to get 201- 810981 to agree to become a consultant. Thereafter, LIEMPTY-3 continued to ask questions about 201-810981's work, to the point where 201-810981 realized that more than a film club for architects was involved. At this point it was decided to let LIEMPTY-3 break cover, recruit 201-810981 to supply information on the work of his office (but not--at this point--the people in his office), and continue to handle him until the recruitment was firm and previous questions about the stability and reliability of 201-810931 had been resolved. This was done, and 201-810981 accepted recruitment, knowing that WOLADY intelligence was involved. LIEMPTY-3 Leld several meetings with 201-810931 after recruitment, and countersurveillance did not reveal any signs of MHILARSH surveillance. For about a month, however, LIEMPTY-3 has not been able to contact 201-810961, and it is possible that the latter has developed cold feet. If LIEMPTY-3 can reestablish contact, he will continue to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 45

# DISPATCH

SECRET

HEMA-33126

handle this case for the time being. If he is unable to reestablish contact, he will be given another lead to follow up. LIEMPTY-3 is a very active person who has an extremely full business day, with many contacts. The Station believes that within this busy "cover" life, LIEMPTY-3 can handle selected operational tasks without coming to hostile attention. As long as propia scecurity precautions are taken by him in wis operational activities, and by him and the Statica officer (who neets him in alias) in their meetings, there is no reason why LIEMPTY-3 cannot be a useful part-tine contributor to the Station's REDTOP program for the foreseeable future.

e. LIRCCKET-1:

1) LIROCKET-1 is met monthly, tine and place arranged at the previous meeting. During these meetings he is debriefed on his twice-weekly teaching sessions at the MIHARSH Embassy. His regular student has been the Subject of 201-028975, and he has had occasional dealings with other CIARSHers, particularly AESEASICK. The meetings with 201-029063 bave not been... of particular interest, and we had been waiting impatiently for the latter's replacement to arrive, so that LIROCKET-1 would have a better target to work on. It was LIROCKET-1 who came up with the first local confirmation of the identity of this replacement (MEXICO CITY 1105, 2 August 1969). Dealings with ALSLASICK have been concerned with attempts by the director of the school where LIROCKET-1 teaches to borrow sociological films from the MHILARSH film office.

2) It now appears, however, that LIROCKET-1 has reached the end of the line. For some tire he has been involved in a rather messy divorce action, and in August LIROCKET-1 reported that his wife had denounced him to Mexican authorities as an RVROCK agent (a few months previously, she had denounced him as an MIMARSH agent). LIROCKET-1 was not inclined to take his wife's ravings too seriously sinco he considered hor slightly nuts. However, LIENVOY reported that on 16 September 1969 LIROCKET-l's wife called 201-028975 and told him she had to see him urgently on something of extreme interest about her husband. 201-028975 told her to come to the Embassy, which she did, and she presumably repeated her accusation. Since that time, LIROCKET-1 has received a polite brush-off. He has been told that the MHIIARSII Embassy has run out of funds for English language training, and that there would be no more lessons. unless 201-028975's replacement, or the nev Ambassador (when and if one arrives) wanted to rehiro him. He was told, however, to check in regularly, and he was given, as usual, an invitation to the annual MHHARSH national day reception (he did not attend because he was ill). LIROCKET-1 has not spoken with 201-028975 since his wife's visit--all dealings have been through AEPOLYP, who has for some time been the paymaster for LIROCKET-1.

3) LIROCKET-1 was not aware of his wife's visit, and even after the case officer, without telling him that we knew of the visit, brought LIROCKET-1 around to the conclusion that she might have done this, he still does not think that she spilled the beans to 201-023975. (It is apparent that the MHHARSHers, whether or not they believe Mrs. LIROCKET-l's story, have concluded that LIROCKET-1 represents a security. hazard, and they are simply going to drop him. LIROCKET-1 will continue to press the MHHARSIlers for an answer regarding his future with them, and if, as suspected, they keep putting him off, he will be instructed to break contact and he will be terminated by the Station.)

4) Other than the blowing of LIROCKET-1 himself, little damage has been done. The wife has never seen the current case officer and knows none of the meeting arrangements or other


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

# SECRET

details, and neither she nor LIROCKET-1 knows the true nace of any of LIFOCKET-1's past or present handlers. Necessary security precautions have been taken at all meetings with LIROCKET since his wife's conversation with 201-028975, and there have been no signs of WARSH surveillance.

f. DUPETAL-1: She has been net veekly for a total of 13 times during the period. Meeting hours are prearranged and the location is always a safehouse. Her normal function has been to report on the activities at the DELET installation where she is employed as the secretary to the DILET Ambassador. In addition, she performed come casing and investigation in support of the AETAKEOFF audio operation. Since the DELET target is of low priority, DIPETAL-1 has been attempting to increase her usefulness to us by trying to obtain a job in the office of the President of the PRI, the ruling political party, with excellent prospects for success.

g. LISACK-2: Until he lost his job in September, he was the resident administrator of the apartment building in which both AEMERGER and AELMESTRO reside. Meetings were held bi-weekly for a total of four times, pre-arranged by telephone call several days in advance to his office in a publishing firm. Meeting location was a restaurant/cafe and meetings normally lasted about thirty minutes. He provided information on the activities of these two MMARSHers and their families, license plate numbers, and descriptions of visitors.

h. LISACK-4: He is the portero of the apartment building in which Subject of 201-305870 resides. He maintains a daily log of the movements and activities of this and other COARSHers, and he reports the license plates and description of visitors to the building. He was met weekly for a total of 12 times, always in a small restaurant within walking distance of the downtown office where he works a half day. Neeting hours aro pre-arranged to permit LISACK-4 to attend on the way to or from this second job. He compensates for his lack of formal education by responsiveness to case officer direction, natural intelligence and cooperation.

i. LISACK-6: He is the portero of the building in which Subjects of 201-837203 and 201-788861 (who took the apartment of Subject of 201-205304) reside. He maintains a daily log of these two MIHARSHers, their families and visitors. He was met 12 times during the period. Since he cannot be absent from the building for over thirty minutes without arousing suspicion, meetings are always for a brief ten minutes and are held in a nearby park. As has been reported, the case officer who handles LISACK-6 became the target of unknown surveillance in August, and again in October, following meetings with LISACK-6. The Station believes that the surveillance was accidental, in that the meeting place was in a neighborhood frequented by male and female prostitutes and other undesirable characters. In any event, LISACK-6 has been put on ice, to be revived if the occupants of his building become higher priority targets.

j. LISACK-7: She was not met during the reporting period. She remains a "reserve asset" for special requirements in the real estate field for such potential uses as safehouse rental, key acquisitions and locating tenants when needed. Although there is no immediate requirement for her talents, we would like to maintain her Operational Approval so that she can be called on as a cleared asset when needed.

4. Problems

There are no problems connected with this Project.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 47

## 5. Security

There are no known unresolved problems of security. The security problems relating to LIROCKET-1 and LISACK-C (discussed above) are under control with no adverse effects noted.

## 6. Plans

a. There are several assets of the REDTOP section who have been carried under SB/COM for a fairly long period of time. Since the targets of their access change from time to time, as well as the nature of the information they provide, we do not believe they warrant special or new projects to cover them. We do believe, however, that they should be brought under a project to facilitate orderly reporting and administration without resorting to separato progress reports on each.

b. Since their activities closely parallel those of assets already covered by LISACK, we believe it would be logical to include LINODBIN-1 and -2, LIORDER-1 and Subject of 201-843659 (on when we are awaiting an Operational Approval) in this Project. Although none of these is paid a salary, such a change will require some cost amendment to the Project to account for minor operational expenses which have heretofore been charged to SB/OOA. Separate correspondence will follow on these assets.

c. There are several additional assets currently in the developmental stage who may eventually be administered under LISACK. These include Subject of HMMA-37742 of 28 August 1969, targetted against AEPOLYP; Subject of 201-851552, targetted against AEMERGER; Subject of 201-848881, currently in social contact with Subjects of 201-259563 and 201-029068 under Station direction; and Subject of 201-859225, who reports on his contacts with Subjects of 201-305052 and 201-744341, among other MHARSHers.

Las "Instalaciones

Por CARLOS MONTIEL

En una carta llegada a es redacción, periodistas peru nos ma inforzan que, enter dos de mi artículo del-il c entro "Ahora Peru", pregun taron al Canciller de aquel país, Edgarco Mercade Jarrin at la llegada de una imatón comercial rasa a Werras pe ruanas seria sólo la primera entrega de otra misión mas importante, ia de una repre sentación diplomática corie tica.

En ese articulo comentaba qua miembros de la Emba:a da moscoria en México, ha bian asegurado en Ins corn Hos sociaies de esta ciudad. que en meses de dos semanas Perd estableceria relaciones diplomáticas con el Kreta, a nivel de embajada.

Según er forman en esa misiva, speras tres dias des pués, el 24 de enero, el diario limeño "La Prens", confirmó en su pranera plana ia mo ticla que sente en EL UNI-VERBAL GRAFICO, y que obteve gras la indiscreción

Ei Cancuier peruano, Mercado Jarrin, quien anuncio la egada de la misión comer ial rusa, respondio a la pre unta de jos periodistas con a lacónico "oportunamente: endran información al es que el Gobierno cecide dar ese paso" del de establecimient de relaciones diplomaticas con la URSS). Antes de que el Gobierno de Lima "decida dar ese paso", cuisiéramos pasar le traslado de estos dos pá rrafos que el periodista Ber nardo Escalante acaba de pu bicar en un articulo de "1 Sol de Mexico" (14 de enero de 1969), ba's el titule: "La Embajada Misteriosa".

"Lo extraño está en que la Embajada de la URSS es una de las que cuentan con per sonal-mas numeroso y las que menor quehacer. tienen. Las dependencias contadas que tienen trato con el público seccion consular, sección culturai, agencia turistica laboran solo cuatro horas a la semana. Con los dedos de la mano se podrán contar los

1.  Reference la made to your request dated 25 July 1969 concerning Subject.

2.  In a report dated 27 August 1962 from a reliable source,
    Subject was listed as a known or suspect KGB (Soviet Committee
    for State Security) officer. Although this report did not specify
    how Subject's position or possible position as an intelligence
    officer was determined, numerous additional reports bave
    established that Subject is an officer in the KGB. Several of
    those reports are noted below.

a. A report dated 12 January 1962 from a
reliable source indicated that Subject
had a background which *"smoiled
strongly"* of Soviet intelligence service
(RIS) connections (i.e., a graduate of the
Foreign Language Institute and/or the
Institute of Foreign Affairs in Moscow).
Subject was described as possibly RIS
as early as 1959 when he attended aa
Electrotechnical Congress heid in Madrid,
Spain, from 30 Jane to 10 July 1959.
During this congrees, Subject was
frequently absent from the celegation,
studiously avoided having his picture
taken, and was generally noted for his
*"suspicious"* behavior.

b. According to a report dated 16 March 1962 from a reliable source. Subject participated in a Soviet effort to cultivate an American Embassy employee.

c. A report dated October 1962 from a reliable source indicated that Subject was believed to be a KGB officer because of his position in the Consular office where most of the personnel were connected with the FC2. Subject had been known to attend meetings in place of other identified KGB officers.

d. According to a report dated 20 December 1963 from other reliable sources, Subject KOSTIKOV had apparently taken over as the case officer for one Margarito LNU, an agent of the Soviets who was formerly handled by First Secretary Viktor Nikitovich GLOTOV. GLOTOV was suspected by reliable sources to be the KGB Resident in Mexico City. Subject also had Valeri V. KOSTIKOV HAD considerable contact with Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV, the Pravda correspondent and suspect KGB officer with whom Subject KOSTIKOV traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, on 1 September 1963. Subject frequently escorted diplomatic couriers to and from the airport, a function primarily of the consular section officers KOSTIKOV and, as far as was known, strictly a KGB responsibility. This same report identified all of Subject's close friends as KGB officers.

3. In a report dated 14 May 1965, a reliable source, in an attempt to analyze the KGB Residentura in Mexico City, Mexico, stated that Subject was probably a KGB officer.

4. According to reports dated 22 December and 27 June 1967 from reliable sources, when Subject came to Mexico he replaced a suspect KGB officer. When he left Mexico, he was replaced by an identified KGB officer.

4. For further information concerning Subject, you are referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

# Embajada rusa en México tiene un gran personal que trabaja poco

Por Carlos Montiel,
desde México.

En usa carta llegada a esta redacción, periodistas peruanos me informaron que, enterados de mi artículo "A-hore Perú", preguntaron al Canciller de aquel pais, Fdgardo Jarrin, si la llegada de una misión comercial rusa a tierras peruanas sólo la primera entrega de otra misión más importante, la de una representacion dipkmática soviética.

En ese artículo comentaba que mienibros de la Embajada moscovita en México, ha-blan asegurado en los corri-Ilos sociales de esta ciudad, que en menos de dos emanas Perú establecería relaciones diplomáticas con el Krem-lin, a tavel de embajada.

Según me informan en esa misiva, apenas tres días dis-pués, el diario limeño "LA Prensa, confirmó en su primera plana la noticia que comenté en EL UNIVERSAL. GRAFICO, y que obtuve gracias a la indisreción de los diplomáticos soviéticos que figuran en el "chrcuito coc-telero que aquí se lleva a cato por los embajadores y encargados de negocios de las naciones extranjeras.

Recuerdo que también en - EL UNIVERSAL GRAFICO, el colega Alonso Fonseca G., publicó una noia titulada "A-logres Diplomáticos", con la divertića his'ona de la "juerga de Vladislav Korceroush-kın y Vakri Kostikov, agregado y segundo secretario, respectivamente, de la embajada rusa en México, que nes la empezaron entre burbujas de vinos casos en la zona rosa de la ciudad de México, y se vieron coligados a ponerie fin en Ciudad Victoria entre sus insulos México bajo inmunidad diplomática. Al parecer los diplomáticos soviéticos no só lo han renunciado a ser decentes, sino que también es-tán demostuando ser incapaces.

El Canciller peruano Mer cado Jartin, quien anunció la llegada de la misión comercial rusa, respondió a la pregunta de los periodistas con un lacunico "oportunarente tendrán información si es que el Gobierno decide dar ese paso" (el de establecimiento de relaciones diplomáticas con la URSS). Anies de que el Gobierno de Lima "decida ese paso, quisieramos pasir-le traslado de estos dos -rrafos que el periodista Ber-parde Escalante. publicó a un articulo de "El Sol de Bié-xico", bajo el titulo: "La Embajada Misteriosa".

"Lo extraño está en que la Embajada de la UPSS es una de las que cuentan con personal más numeroso y las quv menor quehacer unen. Las dependencias contadas q tienen trato con el público - sección consular, εευτιόη cultural, agencia turistica--laooran sólo cuatro boras a la semana. Con los dicos de la mano se podrán contar los mexicanos que en un ato van a solicitar una visa. El comer cio enue México y la URSS es casi nulo. Las "relaciones culturales", como todos lo saben, consisten sólo en harer propaganda "de alla para a-cá", ya que en los dominios de Brezhnev y de Korygin ni idea tienen de lo que es México".

"¿A qué se dedica, poes se enjambre de personal ruso -en esa Embajada en que no trabaja un solo mexicano y hasta la servidumbre e5.60-viética en esa enorme mansión que podia ser guarida de vampiros? El misterio su-be de punto si se oוזי בד cuenta que la - Embajada de México en Moscú apetes st esta integracia por unas seis o siete personas, y en cambio la URSS mantiene aqui mis de un centerar. ¿Por qué la UPSS tjene una Enibajada tan numerosa en nuestro pals, si hace lo mismo que la nues tra en Moscú?

# SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK

by Carlos Fontiel

Source: La Prensa Libre (Free Press), 6 May 1969, San Jose, Costa Rica

Mexico City -- In a letter addressed to our editorial department Peruvian newsmen informed me that, being acquainted with my article "Ahora Peru" [Now Peru], they asked that country's chancellor, Edgardo Jarrin, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important mission, that of Soviet diplomatic representation.

In that article I observed that members of the Soviet embassy in Mexico City had predicted in that city's social circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would establish diplomatic relations with the Kremlin at the embassy level.

According to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lima daily *La Prensa* confirmed with prominent play the report that I had made in *El Universal Grafico* whose substance I had obtained thanks to the indiscretion of Soviet diplomats included in the "cocktail circuit" organized here among the ambassadors and trade representatives of foreign countries.

- 1 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

I recall that also in *El Universal Grafico* my colleague, Alonso Fonseca G., published a note entitled "Alegres Diplomaticos" [Tipsy Diplomats) recounting the entertaining story of the "binge of Vladislav Koromovshkin and Valery Kostikov, attache and second secretary respectively of the Soviet embassy in Mexico. These officials began their spree "between glasses of expensive wines in the 'red' district of Mexico City but had to bring their adventure to a close at Ciudad Victoria amidst the abuse they hurled at Mexico under the diplomatic immunity which they enjoyed." Apparently, the Soviet diplomats not only have given up decent behavior but are also demonstrating their incompetence. [ら]

The Peruvian chancellor, Mercado Jarrin, who announced the arrival of the Soviet trade mission, answered the newsmen's question with a laconic comment that "at the appropriate time you will learn whether the government has decided to take that step" (of establishing diplomatic relations with the USSR). Before the Lima government "decides to take that step," we would like to reproduce these two paragraphs which the journalist Bernardo, Escalante published in an article entitled "La Embajada Misteriosa" (The Mysterious Embassy) in the newspaper *El Sol de Mexico*.

"The strange thing is that the Soviet embassy is one of those with the largest staff but with the least to do. Those branches that have contact with the public -- consular section, cultural section, tourist agency -- work only 4 hours a week. One can count the number of Mexicans applying for a Russian visa on the fingers of one hand. Trade between Mexico and the USSR is practically nil. The 'cultural relations,' as everyone knows, consist simply

- 2 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

in making propaganda 'from one place to another' inasmuch as in the land of Brezhnev and Kosygin they do not even have a remote idea of what Mexico is like.

"What is this plethora of Soviet personnel used for then in that embassy where not even a single Mexican citizen is employed, where the domestics themselves are Soviet, in that huge mansion that could serve as a den of vampires? The mystery deepens if one considers that the Mexican embassy staff in Moscow barely numbers six or seven employees whereas the USSR has more than a hundred in Mexico. Why does the Soviet Union have such a large embassy staff in our country if it does what ours does in Moscow?"

Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT:
REDTOP/AEKICK/AEBURBLE

Reference: HMMA-36517, 14 February 1969

1. On 1 April 1969 the Station received a memorandum from local LNERGO concerning the latest meeting AKBURBLE had with his Soviet Case Orlicers. This memorandum is 1orwarded under separate cover as Attachment #1. The meeting took place in Mexico City on 3 and 4 February 1969. The Soviet case officers were Aleksandr Aleksandrovich NIKITIN (201-784917) and Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV (201-305052).

2. On 8 April 1969 we answered LNERGO's memorandum with comments concerning NIKITIN's and KOSTIKOV's whereabouts on 3 and 4 February 1969, the possible meeting place on 4 February 1969, and the cars used. Recent photographs oi NIKITIN and KOSTIKOV were forwarded to local LNERGO also. This Station memorandum is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment #2.

3. It is interesting to note that the 1969 Volkswagen with Mexico City plates 787 IW, assigned to Stanislav Vasilyevich SYCHEV (201-320963) as used as the vehicle to drive AEBURBLE to the meeting site on 4 February 1969. The use of SYCHEV's vehicle, which is one of two Soviet vehicles which do not have diplomatic license plates, strengthens our suspicion that SYCHEV is a KGB officer.

## Alegres Diplomáticos

Por ALONSO FONSECA G.

Querido lector, esta es la divertida historia de una "parranda" que empezó en la aturdida madrugaza del 2 de diciembre, entre burbujas de vinos caros en la zona rosa de la ciudad ce México, y que termino muy lejos, en Ciudad Victoria. Se trata de dos marxistas-leninistas de la URSS, no para hacer roto las cadenas de ia oprobiosa tirania de los diplomaticos decentes, "empinaron el codo" en bares burgueses, no para alegrarse y olvidar una que otra tristeza que les raspuñaba el corazón, sino para lanzar una andanada de denuestos e injurias a Mexico y a los mexicanos, con el pretexto de que, cuando uno esta "alegrito" todo se le dispensa

Los dipicumáticos de la embajada rusa en Mexico, Valeri Kostikov, egundo secretario, y Vladislav Koromovahkin, agregado, no solo olvidaron entre hippies la moral socialista, para colocarse una "guarapeta de esa que hacen epoca, sino que, en medio de una gran "teria" a base de odiosos. decideron acompañar a cuatro intro ingenieros te PEMEX en un viaje en autovila Ciuda Mante en el camino, des les que provocan los rumes del alcohol la "cruda" los hizo llegar a los peores extremos de la groseria, expuesta sin ningun "academicismo", de esos que la Universidad de la Anustad de Mosca señala como los grandes derechos con-quistados por ios hombres avanzados del leninumo, y Huvieron los denuestos contra los mexicanos. Les cuatro ingenieros de PEMEX -como io hubiera hecho cusiquter hijo bien nacido, defendieron con firmeza a su Patria. Sin más, los rusos se convirtieron subitamente en diplomáticos piatcirros, al empunar sus armas contra ios Ingenieros, pero sin duda porque ia preparacion rusa consiste más blen en el manejo de cohetes tele-drigidos hacia la Luna, que posten manejar con habilidad prosaicas pistolas obsoletas, se vieron prontamente desarma-dos por los mexicanes.

Al legar a Ciudad Victoria, los ingenieros de PEMEX en-tregaron a las autoridades locales los agregados rusos y siis pistolas. Pese al deseo unanime de todos los alli presentes para que los soviéticos fueran castigados, éstos, con arrogancia insultante, exigieron el respeto a su inmunidad diplomática. Corremos nota de la agresividad de ambos moscovitas al gobierno chino de Mao Tse Tung tan empeñado en seguir la lirea dura, aunque no creem que los contrate, ya que soin pistoleros malos.

El lector que quiera confirmarlos delanes de esta borrachera internetaria y sideral, con domines de quienes creen que ron la conquista 80-viética del pater en Rusia el Papel ya decence en Hamar al teletano 15-

# TIPSY DIPLOMATS

by Alonso Fonseca G.

Source: NOL &dentified.

This is the amusing story of a "spree" which began in the frosty dawn of 12 December among bubbles of expensive wines in the "red light" district of Mexico City and reached its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. What are involved are two Marxist-Leninists from the Soviet Union who, on breaking the chains of disgraceful tyranny weighing on respectable diplomats, "tanked up" in tourgeois bars, not in order to cheer up and forget some sorrowful episode or other that gnawed at their hearts but rather to fire a broadside of abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext that when ore is "tipsy" everything that he does is absolved..

The diplomats of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valery Kostikov, second secretary, and Vladislav Koromovshkin, attache, not only forgot among hippies the socialist ethics in order to indulge in a "small drink among those who are in the limelight"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 82

but, in the midst of a big "binge" made possible by hateful capitalist brandy and whiskey, they decided to accompany four engineers of PEMEX (Petroleos Mexicanos; Mexican Petroleum) in an old automobile to Ciudad Mante. On the way, after the custozary excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine" drove the Russians to the worst extremes of crudeness exc without any of the "academic bearing" that the Friendship University of Foscow notes as the major assets acquired by the progressive men of Leninism. Accordingly, abuse rained on the Mexicans.

The four PEMEX engineers, as any well-born sons would have done, defended their country with firmness. Thereupon, the Russians suddenly became transformed into diplomat-gunmen"; brandishing their weapons at the engineers. However, no doubt because Russians are better at getting ready to handle remote-controlled spaceships directed at the moon than in the skillful discharge of prosaic pistols, they found themselves disarmed in short order by the Mexicans.

On reaching Ciudad Victoria the PEMEX engineers handed the Russian attaches and their guns over to the local authorities. Despite the unanimous desire of all those present to see the Soviet representatives get their comeupparce the latter, with insulting arrogance, insisted that their diplomatic immunity be respected.

Let us compare the aggressive stance of both Muscovites with the Chinese government of Mao Tse-tune so insistent on...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 83

following the hard line even though we do not believe that
Mao would hire Russians of this ilk considering how ineffective
munmen they proved to be.

REDCOAT MIGLOO

Soviet Contact with Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegria (201-002689)

1. The Station believes that Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegria,
   Nicaraguan Communist living in exile in Mexico and known to
   have been the link between Moscow and the Nicaraguan Communist
   Party in regard to sending Nicaraguans to both CPSU school and
   Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, is identical with the
   Modesto RIVAS who in 1965 was reported in contact with iden-
   tified KGB officer Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV (201-305052)
   as well as with the Modesto BERMUDEZ, originally thought to
   have been a Panamanian, who in 1965 was reported in contact with
   KOSTIKOV and then with his successor, Vladislav Zorzeyevich
   KOROKHSHIN (201-744341), who is also an identified KGB officer.
   It is noted that Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegria uses the alias
   Modesto RIVAS for receiving mail at his post office box letter
   drop.

2. Following is a chronology of the LISNVOY reporting on
   "Modesto's" contact with the Soviets. As will be seen, it ap-
   pears that the combination "Modesto BERMUDEZ" was a conclusion
   jumped to by LISNVOY and was in fact probably never given as
   such. The references to "Panamanians" could be a cover for
   "Nicaraguans."

a. On 1 Jun 1965 "Modesto RIVAS" called at the Soviet
Embassy for KOSTIEOV and arranged to meet him at four o'clock
"in the same place."

b. On 29 Jun 1965 "Modesto ARIAN" called KOSTIKOV to say he would like to talk with him and also to give him the message that Ricardo was waiting in his office for him. KOSTIKOV asked if Modesto was working that day, and wind Modesto said no, he would be working at home all day, then KOSTIKOV said he would stop by his house in the afternoon.

c. On 6 Jul 1965 "Modesto" called KOSTIKOV and asked if there was anything new about the people travelling to Helsinki. KOSTIKOV said nothing yet, but he hoped to have word by the end of the week. KOSTIKOV also asked if Modesto had received any news from the doctor, and Modesto said no, even though he had sent a telegram. Modesto said he would keep a copy of the telegram be sent for KOSTIKOV.

d. On 7 Jul 1965 "Modesto" told KOSTIKOV that, after he had talked to him the day before, he had received a cable asking the same question, i.e., what was with the trip to Helsinki, and Modesto wanted to know what to answer. KOSTIKOV said that they would have to wait about two more days but that he would send a cable to pressure for an answer. Modesto said he would answer his cable saying that they were trying to get a cabled reply and added that he would be in his office in the afternoon, if KOSTIKOV wanted to reach him.

e. On 8 Jul 1965 a man identified by voice as the above Modesto called at the Soviet Embassy for the Vice Consul (i.e. KOSTIKOV). He was told to call back, and when asked who was calling, he said he was calling on behalf of the Panamanians ("de parte de los panamenos").

f. On 9 Jul 1965 a man called at the Soviet Embassy for KOSTIKOV, who was out. The man then said to leave the message that "BERMUDEZ...no...tell him that Modesto called." (This is evidently what made the LIENVOY monitors assume that the caller's name was "Modesto BERMUDEZ.")

g. On 9 Jul 1965 a man left a message at the Soviet Embassy for KOSTIKOV saying that Modesto had called. (This comes out in LIENVOY as being a call from "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameno," but this was probably the monitor's way of identifying the same man of the above conversations and not what the man actually said.)

h. On 12 Jul 1965 Modesto again spoke to KOSTIKOV (and is again described by LIENVOY as "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameno"). Modesto informed KOSTIKOV that the job from Lissanda ("el encargo de Lissonda") had arrived. KOSTIKOV suggested meeting Modesto at the usual place and asked if (he, it?) was with Modesto. Modesto said yes, at his house, and KOSTIKOV said then it would be better for him to visit them at his house. Modesto also asked about the "other matter," but KOSTIKOV still had no news.

i. On 14 Jul 1965 it was again reported that "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameno" called and left a message to tell KOSTIKOV that he had called. (Again, the "Modesto BERMUDEZ" is probably a LIENVOY assumption, rather than what Modesto actually said.)

j. On 4 Aug 1965 Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameno" (again, probably the LIENVOY assumption) called at the Soviet Embassy for AOBMUSERIN and was told to call him on another number. (No record of a second call.)

k. On 12 Aug 1965 LIENVOY reported that "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameno" called KOBMUSERIN and asked whether the youth had been dispatched. KOBMUSERIN said he had just left.

1.  On 22 Sep 1965 LIENVOY reported that "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameñc" called from inside the Soviet Embassy at 1128 hours to a local travel agency (T.(1./Greyhound) and spoke with dien LABASTIDA, asking her about the price of the ticket to Prague under the same system they had used to send the other people. LABASTIDA asked for one of the names in order to pull the card to see how it had been done, and "BERMUDEZ" gave her the name Guillermo AGUIRRE. LABASTIDA gave him various possible flights and asked that he call back in the afternoon for more definite information. (Station traces show that Guillermo AGUIRRE Rodriguez, 201-245711, is a Nicaraguan who was at the CPSU school in Moscow in 1965.) (LILYRIC reported that the man in the attached photograph, who is undoubtedly identical with Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegria, visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City from 1111 to 1137 hours. There therefore seems no question that he is the "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameño" who has been reported by LIENVOY in all the above conversations.)

2.  On 29 Sep 1965 LIENVOY reported that "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panameño" called KORBUSHKEIN and said he had some things ("encargos") for him. KORBUSHKEIN said he would see Modesto at seven o'clock in the usual place.

12 May 1965

SUBJECT: Contact Report/ Silvia McDonald
12 May; Maria Cristina garden

1. Cestetner, known as Don Jackson, and Martheine, introduced as Kort Bryan, met Subject on 12 May. Subject reported on her attendance at the WIII Victory celebration at the SovEmb held on 9 May, and its aftermath on 11 May at the art gallery of Alfredo Sentos.

2. Subj, who attended the reception alone, her invited friend Georgina did not go, attracted a small circle of companions during the evening. First, there was a Guatemalan, a professor at the National University, who made conversation, learned she was a singer, and spoke of having her appear at a concert in Puebla. Next, Vladimir Andreev, his receiving line duties ended, joined her. Their conversation dealt with artists in Mexico, a pick-up from the first time they had met at the Santos Gallery some two months ago. Then, Valeriy came by and seemed to be mostly interested in watching Subject. Subj took an instant dislike to Valeriy (probably Kostikov). A short, blond Russian then drifted into the group, whom Subj pegged as a parachutist. This turned out to be accurate (probably Nikolai Leonov). Andreeva came by just about the time Subj was inviting the group to visit the Santos Gallery. Subj was just about able to include Andreeva in the invitation, and then Andreeva was gone from the group. The invitation was for 11 May at 1100. During the evening Andreev mentioned that he would like Subj to perform at the SovEmb. Subj said she would, but no details for the engagement were made.

3. On 11 May Andreev and Valeriy showed up at the Santos Gallery. Subj introduced them to Alfredo Santos. Andreev seemed to be enchanted by the Gallery; Valeriy was less demonstrative. They had brought a bottle of Vodka and passed a few hours in the company of Alfredo. Subj confirmed her distaste for Valeriy, and formed her impression of Andreev that he wanted to break out of dull Soviet circles into the gayer, freer atmosphere of the artist set in Mexico. No specific appointment was made for Subj to see either of the two Sovs another time.

4. Subj, in her concern to know where this operation was taking her and the part she was to play in it, rang in some additional characters in her personal life. There was Georgina (Inu), her very good friend, aimless, clinging to Subject's orbit, student at U of A, who considered Andreev a "dear." Subj considered that Andreev and Georgina might very well develop a relationship


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 139

2. 
because she, Subject, though willing to pursue a platonic friendship with Andreev would have none of the other, and it was not unlikely that Georgina might captivate Andreev. There was Antonio Garza, Subject's current boy-friend, a bodyguard to Dias Ordaz, who was giving evidence of growing serious about her. Subj was concerned that her participation in the operation might in some way cause harm to Antonio. Subject who entertains a host of artist friends at her home expressed concern that if she were followed and spied upon, a misleading impression might be gained.

5. Other personal matters about Subject that came out in the conversation were that she has income from stocks (sufficient to maintain her in Mexico), she is in visitante artista status, would like to attain inmigrado because she has difficulties with the Musicians Union (ANDA) that hampers pursuit of her profession; she is not interested in marriage; she is opposed to by-passing the limitations on her work imposed by her status.

6. The C.O.'s, in their guidance to Subject, made it clear that she could pull out of the operation any time she wanted, that it was in her power to terminate it either with us or with the Sovs, if she got involved with them. She was told that there was absolutely no harm that could befall her boy-friend, Antonio, from her continued participation. As for Georgina, the chips would have to fall as they may with Andreev; since Subject was Georgina's confidante, we would be appreciative of knowing about Andreev's involvement in any affair. She wanted to know why we were interested in Andreev, and the C.O.'s gladhanded her to the extent of telling her that it was our business to know about important Soviets, since one never knew when a Soviet might be in need of "help." Subject indicated she was willing to go along further at a slow pace.

7. In talking about the Soviet Victory reception, the presence there of LICRAVE-1 (his picture had been in the News) came up. Subject said she knew L-1. She characterized L-1 as flighty. She said he didn't get along with his wife. She intimated that when L-1 was lonely, he chased after female companionship. L-1 drops by Subject's place every so often. She knew that L-1 had left his father's business and had gone in for crop-dusting (a relatively recent development).

8. Arrangements were made that "Mort" would keep in touch with Subject about once a week by phone (Tel. 46-71-06, Calle Rio Nova #32) and that later she would be given an emergency number to call.

SUBJECT: Operational/REDCOAT/LCIMPROVE/Characterization of Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV

1.  Forwarded herewith is a characterization of Subject prepared by Douglas J. FEINGLASS. The SPR on Subject has been prepared and will be forwarded as soon as typed.

2.  It is interesting to note that LICOWL-1 describes KOSTIKOV as follows: He is a man who would do anything to anybody. He is without morals, education or manners. He uses foul language and has no respect for others. When KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-l's) establishment, with Sovlet women present, KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees, while their husbands are present, and thinkno:hing of it. According to LICOWL-1, the husbands say nothing when KOSTIKOV does this. (Comment: However, from a recent LICOWL-1 tape, It appears that Yuriy Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV, GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he (ANDRIANOV) was going to say something to KOSTIKOV - someday - but had no: said a word to him as yet.)

# Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV

Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV is approximately 35 years of age, corpulent and paunchy, with a round somewhat fleshy face that sports a 5 o'clock shadow, and wears oversized tinted glasses in dark heavy frames, which partially obscure a pair of small, but plercing eyes. His heavy jowla thin lips, wide nostrils and dark hair add to an impression that his features are more of a Semitic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav. A shapeless dark suit-coat, carelessly put over a white shirt, with unbuttoned collar, through which protrudes a tuft of dark hair complete a photograph of Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV, Attache ot the Consular Office and Identified member of the KGB.

KOSTIKOV arrived in Mexico in December 1961 and assumed his duties as an attache at the USSR Consulate at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Owing to his extrovert nature and propensity for drinking, he soon acquired several "buddles" of similar background and with similar tastes. Among these individuals, his closest assoclates have been, or still are, the following

Vitally Borisovich SHUBIN, Attache and Identified member of the KGB, who left for the USSR in July 1964; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERIYEV, Pravda Correspondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR in October 1964; and Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO, Vice-Consul and ideatifled member of the KGB, who is still in Mexico, and who has accepted KOSTIKOV into his circle of Intimate friends.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

However, it was mostly with SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV that KOSTIKOV felt entirely at ease. Many a time KOSTIKOV would talk to elther one of them on the phone and indulge in a friendly exchange of obscenities, where- as he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO In a like manner, even though KOSTIKOV has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's house, KOSTIKOV developed an exceedingly close relationship with SHUBIN. They used to travel together to various parts of the country and to spend time together with their families at the Casino de la Selva, a hotel in Cuernavaca. But it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTIKOV's attentions. An embittered acrimonious woman, Roza, who despised her husband and had a flerce hatred for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed Inro a different human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her on the phone in his best unctuous and ingratiatlon manner. It is impossible to say whether they had sexual relatlons, but the obvious and strong sexual overtones in Roza's volce led one to presume that she had more than just a friendly Interest in KOSTIKOV, who on the other hand, was probably using Roza as a target for his amorous or Illicit aspirations.

It seems that KOSTIKOV is quite preoccupled with matters of sex and if given an opportunity would turn into a veritable profligate. Apparently his


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 153

wife Roza has a tolerant attitude towards KOSTIKOV's probable Incur-
slons into the domain of maltal infidelity, strice, on one occasion,
when KOSTIKOV had been Invited to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV's
home, and Roza KOSTIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV agalust
drinking too much, a woman answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV
to the phone. When Roza talked to KOSTIKOV it sounded that she was more
peeved at the fact that she had not been invited to the party rather than that
other women were present there at the time.

When KOSTIKOV started talking to his wife on this particular call, he
already had had a few drinks and in disguised voice spoke to her in Spanish,
French and English, possibly to Impress those who were present. His
Spanish is quite good and fluent, his French is rather tolerable, but his
English is somewhat stilted and of a school-room type. Possibly, he studied
these languages at the Moscow Institute of Languages.

This fluency in Spanish affords KOSTIKOV a great latitude for making
friends among Mexicans and his easy-going earthy approach is presumably
of considerable help to him in developing contacts. Since his consular
dutles are quite negligible, he can easily engage in this sort of activity.
In fact, this neglect of official duties prompted a heated argument between
NECHIPORENKO and the visiting Soviet correspondent Timur GAYDAR,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

who declared tha: ostensibly the consular stafi does not preform any useful function, but just loafs around, H's assertion has been confirmed in part by the attitude of this particular group of Sovlet Embassy employees, who qulte often seek some diversion of a non-Intellectual type. Thus, on one occasion, when a group of Sovlet touristhas a brief stay in Mexio, one of them a woman, complained during a phone call to the Embassy that KOSTIKOV and Leonid Vasilyevich NIKIFOROV, Intourist representative In Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIFOROV's apartment In order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourists without any Information about their next move and letting them shift for themselves.

Since the departure of SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV, KOSTIKOV has started to "cultivate" NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potentlal drinking companion, and has been talking to him on the phone a number of times recently in quite a familiar tone of voice. It seems that. NIKIFOROV, a younger man, is being Influenced by KOSTIKOV to a certain degree.

KOSTIKOV's family life does not appear to be a stormy one, because his wife Roza A. sounds easy-going and friendly. She is in charge of the Embassy's dining-room. Her co-workers treat her with a good-humored tolerance and a slight contemp:, KOSTIKOV's daughter Svetlana, born in 1959, seems to be an average child, who does not present any outstanding problems to her parents.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 155

To summarize KOSTIKOV's character traits and abilities: KOSTIKOV
Is well trusted to take trips around the country in the company of another
Soviet Embassy employee on various matters of Importance and, on
occasions, he acts as an interpreter for visiting Soviet officials. His
known physical defect is weak eyes. Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called up
an eye-specialist for an appointment, because his eyes were troubling him
and that is probably the reason for his wearing tinted glasses. Sometimes
Mexicans refer to him as the man with glasses. It is quite possible that an
auto accident KOSTIKOV had in Veracruz may have been caused by his
somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessness. However,
when KOSTIKOV was excusing himself for it, GARMASHEV, to whom
he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that it was about time KOSTIKOV
learned to drive.

Owing to this shortcoming of having weak eyes and his physical make
up, KOSTIKOV does not participate in various Indoor or outdoor sports as
much as do other members of the Soviet Embassy. It seems that billiards
are about the most strenuous execise that he undertakes. However, it must
not be surmised that he is a weak individual in a physical sense and will
probably give a good account of himself if a situation will demand It.
Many of his intimate collaborators call him "Kopchenyy" or "Smoked"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 156

which in Russian slang may mean an individual with a dark skin, or may
refer to the fact of his wearing tinted glasses, or it may signify that he went
through a school of hard knocka

It is quite certain that KOSTIKOV and ALFERIYEV belong to the same
group of former hooligans, who by dint of sheer disregard for moral
standards forged ahead and became "somebodles".

KOSTIKOV seems to be qulte unsrupulous, ready to perform any sort
of task set before him, not in a cold and methodical way, but with a cer-
tain zest and bravado. It appears that he has no moral, religious, or
any other type of scruples. He Is vulgar, untidy and lecherous, with a
penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions in conversation with
his "buddies", with whom he drinks quite a lot, circumstances permitting
In addition, it must be noted that he is a shrewd and resourceful individual
unquestionably loyal to the Communist system.

# AMPUPFIZ

AEPUPIZ positively ivertified photo of Valeriy Vlasiri-ovich KOSTYCZ as Soviet who had met him in 'exico City on 9, 11 and 12 Feb 1913. KOSTIKCV gave FURPLE meeting arran events for next meeting to be in NYC. Soviet who appeared in NYC was Clog D. Park!. PREKIN has been identified as wenter 13th Dept of EGA'S FCD.

PURPLE is naturalized German Averican, has crop dusting business in Middle est, furnished info on industrial and missile sites in area. PRYKIN particularly in crested in pipelines.

The 13th Dept may have exercised its prerogative and taken over case from First (Endrican) Dept. Forser case officer Yuriy V. TIKOV was apparently fron American Dept, not lath. Put it appears that PRI asked PURPLE for save its type of info assigned by KOSTIKOV, susresting that CSTIKOV was from same KGB dept a PRYKIN.

# Chief of Station, Mexico City

FILE TITLE/NUMBER: Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV (201-305052)

INCLUSIVE DATES:

1.  We have recently reviewed available information on Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV, a consular attache at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It appears quite possible that KOSTIKOV may be a member of the Thirteenth Department of the KGB's First Chief Directorate, as will be seen below.

ROOM:

2.  KOSTIKOV has been positively identified as the Soviet who met AEBUZELE in Mexico City on 9, 11 and 12 February 1963. (Mexico City Station identified KOSTIKOV as the only Soviet in Mexico who fit the description, and subsequently AEBIRELE identified him from a photo spread.) KOSTIKOV received information from ARBURBLE on industrial-and-missile sites in PEPRIME and gave him requirements of the same nature for the future. KOSTIEOV also made arrangements with AEBURBLE for his next meeting, to be held in New York City with a different, un-identified Soviet. On 6 May 1963 AEBURBLE was met in accordance with the above arrangements by Oleg Danilovich KRYKIN (201-292588) (a translator assigned to the United Nations Secretariat in New York City). BRYKIN has been identified by a sensitive, reliable source as a member of the KGB's Thirteenth Department. AKBURBLE passed BRYKIN aeronautical charts and was given additional requirements particularly relative to missile bases. Nothing transpired during the latter meeting to suggest that BRYKIN wished to change the nature of the case, and in fact he told AKBURBLE that he was doing a good job. It therefore can reasonably be assumed that BRYKIN and KOSTIKOV both were representing the same KGB department.

3. It has been reliably reported that at present the KGB's Thirteenth Department places the greatest emphasis on its sabotage mission. Sabotage targets include the most important strategic military and industrial facilities of Western countries. The requirements assigned to AEBURBLE by both KOSTIKOV and BRYKIN correspond to this mission.

4. In view of the obvious ODYOKE interest in any activities of the Thirteenth Department, we urge that you prepare an analysis of KOSTIKOV's activities and contacts in Mexico.

While waiting at the Airport FRANK was overheard talking on a pay telephone. He mentioned to the person he called that he was phoning long distance and that he could be reached at 714-454-7126.

# AMERICAN LEFTISTS FLOCKING TO PEKING: Communist China has instituted its own Open Door
policy for American leftists, some of then with long-standing ties to Communist parties.
A reception in Peking carly this month provided intelligence agencies with a partial
glimpse of who is welcome, and the relative pecking order. Turning out to be greeted by
Premier Chou En-Lai and his two top assistants, Kuo Mo-jo and Keng Piao, were about 70
Americans, some permanent Peking residents and government employees. Radio Peking listed
some by name, deliberately concealing the identity of others. Greeting Chou were "All
members of the delegation of Revolutionary Union" (RU is a fanatically pro-Mao armed revo-
lutionary group centered around Palo Alto and Richmond, Calif.), Pablo "Yoruba" Guzman,
head of the Young Lords Party, Black Panther's Huey Nexton, Elaine Brown and Robert Bay,
and "16 American young people led by Mrs. Carmelita Hinton" (of Putney, Vt.). Also Mr.
& Mrs. Max Granich (brother of the late Communist writer Mike Gold), William Epton (ex-
member of Progressive Labor Party), Jack Belden (author of pro-Red China book), Mrs. Susan
Warren (an old CP and PLP functionary), Dick Frank (Mrs. Warren's husband), Mr. & Mrs.
Hoseah Williams (of Southern Christian Leadership Conference), Kr. & Mrs. John S. Service
(cx-State Department exployee, recently "rehabilitatei" by liberal press in U.S.) Mr.&
Mrs. Willian H. Hinton, Mr. & Mrs. Jack Schulman, Mr. & Mrs. Henry Wilcox, Dr. & Mrs.
Samuel Rosen, Mr. & Mrs. Victor X. Sidel, and Geoffrey Collins.

Among Feking residents present were: Frank and Ruth Coe, Sol and Pat Adler (Frank Coe and
Sol Adler were implicated in Soviet espionage in Washington in the '40s), Erwin Engst,
Joan Hinton (his wife, and a developer of U.S. and probably Red Chinese atomic bombs),
Bertha Sneck (ex-Mrs. Willian Hinton), Eleanor Chaidin, Julian Schuman (once indicted for
treason in Korean War), Norman Schulman, Sidney Shapiro, Ione Kramer, Betty Chang, Alice
E. Cheng, Lucille Stewart, Carmelita Hinton (the younger) and Fred Engst (name order ua-
doubtedly is clue to rating).

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: LIROCKET-1 P-12,24:4

DATE OF MEETING: 27 June 1967

1. I met Subject from 1300-1430 on 7 June at the Capistrano Restaurant. I paid him $2,000 M.N. as his salary for May and June. The next meeting is set for 25 July at 1300 at the Capistrano.

2. Subject conducted 14 classes at the Soviet Embassy during the reporting periods:

1 June

1530-1700 -- BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, ROMANCHEKO. Subject asked if KAZANTSE had gone out of town, as he had told Sübject he would probably do. BERI replied without hesitation that KAZATSEV had gone to Moscow and wouldn't be back until about 15 June.

6 June

1530-1700 -- BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, ROMANCHENKO. Toward the end of class, BEDRIN said there were two men who wanted to speak with Subject after class. Following class, two men Subject didn't recognize came in and CONCHARENKO and ROMANCHENKO left. The two men were introduced as Vladimir SOKOLOV and Pavel KOVALEV. BEDRIN explained briefly that they also were Pinterested in taking English lessons, and thereupon left with the comment that he didn't believe he was needed. SOKOLOV was the first of the twosome to speak, repeated that he and KOVALEV wished to take lessons, and then turned things over to KOVALEV, who, he said, spoke better Enga ish thạn hè. KOVALEV proceeded to state that he had served in Washington, D.C. for three years, had served an earlier tour in Mexico, and had been back in Mexico for about a month. (KAZANTSEV later said he and KOVALEV had served in

Washington at the same time.) At one point KOVALEV referred to SOKOLOV as his "chief." SOKOLOV interjected that he was leaving Mexico "sometime this year" and wanted to brush up on his English in preparation for the 4th year English proficiency test he would have to take when he returned to the USSR. Subject said that on the whole, he got the impression that KOVALEV was replacing SOKOLOV. A schedule of two classes a week, from 1800-1930 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, was agreed upon. One of the two Soviets mentioned that the funds for their lessons would come out of the military department.

1715-1830 - SOKOLOV and KOVALEV asked when Subject would suggest they have their first lesson, and Subject replied that since KAZANTSEV was away, they might as well begin immediately. The Soviets readily agreed. Subject described KOVALEV's English as good. His grammar is a little better than KAZANTSEV's, but he is not quite as fluent as KAZANTSEY. SOKOLOV's English is *fair*, but he is decidedly behind KOVALEV and KAZANTSEV in both grammar and fluency. Nevertheless, Subject feels SOKOLOV is good enough to be in the same class as KOVALEV.

8 June

1530-1700 - BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, ROMANCHENKO.

1700-1830 - KOVALEV and SOKOLOV.

13 June

1530-1700 - BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, ROMANCHENKO.

1700-1830 - KOVALEV and SOKOLOV.

15 June

1520-1700 - Subject arrived at the Embassy early. BEDRIN came into the Reception Room about 1520 and took Subject to the classroom (in which there has always been a TV set). Three of the guards were sitting around the TV watching the Salazar fight when Subject and BEDRIN entered. GONCHARENKO


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 5

came in about 1530 and ROMANCHENKO about 1540. All watched the fight until it ended about 1550, after which the class began.

1700-1830 -- KOVALEV and SOKOLOV.

20 June

1530-1700 -- BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, ROMANCHENKO.

1700-1800 -- KAZANTSEV. KAZANTSEV began talking about his trip on his own initiative. He said he left Mexico City on 30 May and arrived in Moscow on 3 June. (He did not say when he returned to Mexico.) He gave no reason for the trip, but said he had "several conferences and meetings" in Moscow. Subject interjected that he thought the trip might have had something to do with the Middle East crisis, since it broke out just about the time KAZANTSEV left. KAZANTSEV laughed spontaneously at this idea and replied that what he knew about the Middle East wouldn't do anyone any good. He then went on to say he had spent his first weekend in Moscow with his son, who shortly thereafter left for his summer job in "Siberia." He said he spent the second weekend (10-11 June) with his daughter. The daughter, according to KAZANTSEV, had planned to go "south" for a 2-3 week vacation in early June, but postponed the vacation when she learned her father was coming. (The implication, according to Subject, was that KAZANTSEV's trip came about fairly suddenly.) What KAZANTSEV was most interested in talking about, however, was the fact he had unexpectedly had had to take his English proficiency test in Moscow. He consequently set aside the last three days of his stay for the test, which can often take that long. The first day is taken up by an oral test, and if one passes that, he goes on to the written test, which can take up to two days. KAZANTSEV, however, did so well on the oral test that he was exempted from the written test. He said his examiners gave him a "4" (on a 1-5 scale) and would have given him a "5" except for the fact he hadn't read any books in English since his last test. One is supposed to read four or five books a year in English, according


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 6

to KAZANTSSY. In any event, KAZANTSEV was very happy with the outcome and with Subject's work in preparing him for the test. In fact, he said that although he had originally started taking lessons from Subject only to prepare for the test, he was so satisfied with his progress that he intended to stay on with Subject despite the fact the test was behind him.

1500-1930 - KOVALSV and SOKOLOV.

22 June

1530-1700 KAZANTSEV took the first hour and a half. He merely said BEDRE, CONCHARSKO, and ROMANCHENKO would not attend class that day.

1700-1530-- KOVALEV and SOKOLIN.

3. KOLEV and SOKOROY. SOKOLOV is the more simpatico of the two. While KOVALEV can be very pleasant, he seems to have an antagonistic strain and occasionally challenges Subject's teaching with: "That isn't the way we do it in our courses," etc. Sometimes, in fact, the disputes on methods, points of grammar, etc. have become rather heated. On these occasions, SOKOLOV has, usually stepped in more or less on Subject's side and cooled things off. At their second meeting, KOVALEV asked Subject directly what his views were on the Middle East crisis, Subject türned the question back on KOVALEV by saying he would frankly be more interested in KOVALEVIS ideas, as he was sure KOVALEV was much better informed about the situation than he. KOVALEV backed away this time, claiming he dian't have much information either, but at a later class both he and SOKOLOV parroted the Soviet line about the crisis--Israel was the aggressor, etc. On another occasion when the Middle East was again the topic, Subject referred to (what he recalled as) President Truman's post-World War II proposal to internationalize both the Suez and Panama canals. KOVALEV immediately objected to this idea, although he gave no indication of ever having thought about it before.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 7

4. KOVALEZ. Subject said he mentioned KOVALEV and SOKOLOV to his wife, and she immediately recalled KOVALEY as one of her students at the Nextcin-North Aclean Institute back in the late 50's or early 60's.. She told Subject that he had been frienily with a number of people at the Institute (students and teachers). One of these, she recalled, was Bill CASTELAZO, a U.S. citizen who then and still teaches English and Spanish at the Instituto. CASTELAZO is about 35. He vis Arong 24 20-25 persons who? or 8 years ago studied Russian at the Institute when it was tought for a brief time by a Russian woman. go Subject's wife told Subject that KOVALEV and CASTELAZO had been very friendly and that KOVALEV had invited him to the Soviet Embassy at least twice. CASTELAZO told Subject's wife that after one of his visits to the Soviet Embassy, he was approached by somoone from the American Embassy and asked to inform on the Soviets. CASTALAZO said he was repelled by the idea of being a n informer and implied that he hadn't cooperated with the American. Subject said he had not known about CASTELAZO's acquaintance with KOVALEV, but had known that CASTELAZO had studied Russian and had had him to his apartment along with ROMANCHENKO, BEDRIN, and CONCHARENKO for his 1 July 1966 DeAron Dominion Day party.

5. Subject subsequently mentioned to KOVALEV that his wife remembered having him as a student during his previous tour. Subject also remarked that his wife had mentioned that KOVALEV and his (Subject's) friend CASTELAZO had been friends. KOVALEV replied without any embarrassment that he didn't remember Subject's wifo, but did remember CASTELÁZO. KOVALEV asked Subject to give CASTELAZO his rogards the next time he saw him.

6. Other than a 1960 reference to "Guillermo CASTELAZO" as a 20-93 year old teacher at the Mexican-North American Institute and an author of one of the Institute's text books, there are no Station traces on


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

the Cistalizo in question. (See 50-6-55/3. CR of 13 Sept. 190.)

7. LOGIHOY. When Subject was leaving the ambassy on 15 Jane (about 1835), he met ACGIHOV in front of the Reception Room. They talked, chiefly about sports for about 15 minutes. LOGICO said skiing and speed skating were two of his favorite sports, and that his greatest sporting interest in Mexico was playing tennis. Subject said that LOGINOV seemed to be an avid sportsman. LOGINOV said that he was going to Moscow on vacation toward the end of July. No reference was made to Subject teaching LOGOV's son English when the LOGINOVS return from vacation, but Subject assumes this is still LOGI:OV's wish.

8. Subject to Rendermans Make Tapes At Pasay Prior to Class. At one of their classes after KAZANTSEV's return from Moscow, Subject and KAZANTSEV discussed Subject's making tapes for use in connection with his three Engassy classes. It was agreed that Subject would come to the Embassy half an hour or so early once a week to make the tapes. He was to begin on 27 June (the day of our meeting). Subject did not yet know where he was to do the recording, whether he would be left alone, "etc.

9. Subject said he was considering having another Dominion Day Party on 1 July to which he would invite his Soviet students. I encouraged the lde: and told him I'd pick up the tab.

10. The week of 19 June the wife of President DIAZ Ordas called the Director of the Instituto Irlandes and asked if he could recommend a tutor for a nephew of hers. The director replied that the Instituto had a good- English teacher and that although he was very busy, he would ask him if he would be willing to take on the nephew. The director communicated the above to Subject, and Subject gave the Director a list of the few hours he had free. The director told Subject he would call Mrs. DIAZ Ordas back and woula infora Subject if any of the hours were suitable. As of 27 June, Subject hadn't heard further from the director.

MEMO OF CONVERSATION
Leila BELAVAL, Visa Officer of U.S. Embassy

1. I talked to Leila today about her contact with the Soviet who brought BAZAROV's passport in for a visa yesterday. She Identifled the Soviet from a photograph as Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, and said that he is always the one who comes to the U.S. Embassy for visas. She did not recognize the photograph of Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSIIKIN, the Vice Consul. Actually, Leila believed that LOGINOV was a Vice Consul, said she always asks for him as such when she has to call the Soviet Embassy.

A 2. Apparently yesterday was not the first time that LOGINOV has tried to make a date with Leila. She says that he always asks her what she does In her free time, and that she has put him off by saying that she is very busy. Once shexx he asked her whether she spent her free time with other people ax from the Embassy and was surprised to hear that she usually spends her off hours with non-Embassy friends. Yesterday LOGINOV again asked hér what she did in the evenings, and she said she was especially busy now because she has started taking guitar lessons. He mentioned some Soviet dance group that was coming to Mexico in a month or so and said he would like to invite her to go to see them with him. He also told her he was not married. Leila sald she did not refuse the invitation outright but said that she did not know whether she would be free when they came or not.

3. I told Leila a few of the facts of Sov let life: that all Soviets have to be married in order to go overseas, that LOGINOV Is a KGB officer and was obviously trying to get his foot in the door of the U.S. Embassy through her, that he was undoubtedly disappointed to hear that she did not spend all her free time with other Embassy people, etc. Leila has evidently been unsure about how to react to LOGINOV's advances, has not wanted to be rüde to him, and seemed relieved when I suggested that she simply decline his invitations by always being busy. She says she does not like his slick manner at all, and I gather that she has felt uneasy in having to deal with him, but now that someone has told her how to react she will have no problem,

4. Leila mentioned that LOGINOV knows English but is reluctant to use it. He once read off the visa stamped in a passport in peffect English, and he also read a copy of the new visa regulations in English (to himself, but evidently understanding it all). According to the new regulations, Soviets no longer need visas for continuous transit of the U. S. (i. e., on the same flight), but LOGINOV insisted on getting a visa for BAZAROV in spite of this. (This is confirmed in LIENVΟΥ.)

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: LICOZY-5

DATE OF MEETING: 15 June 1967

1. I met with Subject at the Del Paseo from 0900 to 1000. The next meeting is for 18 July at 0830 at the same place.

2. On 8 June LOGINOV dropped by Subject's office to leave two tickets for the Bolshoy Ballet performance on 11 June. Subject invited LOGINOV and his wife for dinner and LOGINOV accepted for 13 June. (COMMENT: LIENVOY reports their confirming this date on 12 June). Subject said the tickets were used by his wife and son.

3. The guests on 13 June were LOGINOV and wife, William do Mier (P-5552), manager of KLM in Mexico and Gustavo ORTIZ Hernan (P-10971). ORTIZ was Mexico's first Ambassador to Israel and is very pro-Israel. He recently retired from the Mexican Foreign Service. Hie last job was Ambassador to Chile. He is 57 years old and apparently a good friend of Subject's. Subject invited ORTIZ because he knew that LOGINOV has been interested in public opinion in Mexico about the recent Israel-Arab war. Subject had been only able to give LOGINOV the opinions of Mexican Jews and he wanted LOGINOV to talk to a real Mexican. The deck was slightly, loaded since Subject knew that ORTIZ is an Israeli partisan. Bubject purposely avoided the subject but it was not long before ORTIZ asked LOGINOV about the Soviet position on the matter. LOGINOV answered with a banality about the USSR only wanting peace. ORTIZ then unloaded on LOGINOV for about half an hour. He told him that he had been in Israel as ambassador and had seen both sides. If the Soviets were interested in peace, why didn't they help the miserable and diseased Arabs with medicine, hospitals, Job training, agricultural aid, etc? This is what they need, not tanks and jets. The Soviets are the real aggressors by araing the Arabs and egging them on. And what fools the Sovs are since the Arabs will never learn to operate any equipment, much less sophisticated stuff. Soviet hypocrisy is obvious to everybody. FEDORENKO's performance at the UN was shameful, etc. LOGINOV never answered a word. Subject later reported the above to the Israeli Ambassador who was pleased since ORTIZ is not a Jew and he is sure the above would be reported to Moscow.

4. LOGINOV said he will leave on 23 July for vacation in the USSR. Subject saw Mrs. LOGINOV for the second time. Since her Spanish is extremely limited, she did not participate in general conversation. However, she handled herself well and did not seem in the least ill at ease. In a side conversation ahe told Subject that they have a fifteen year old daughter who is living with her mother. She said that she has known LOGINOV since the age of six as neighbors in Moscow. Finally, she said that she is a chemical engineer.

5. I asked if Subject had talked to Hiriam AVILA Kats (581) again about her contacts with our Embassy. He said be hadn't. I asked what advice he had given her. He said that he had told her to be truthful with the Americans and to be careful with LOGINOV.

LITENBF-1
IA JUN 67

On the 9 May I went with my wife to the reception given by the ambassador of Checoslovaquia on the occasion of htior National Day.
The party took place in the garden where there were a couple of tables seating about ten persons each. Most of the people seating at the tables were from embassies behind the Iron curtain, or local supporters of the extreme left such as Cordero Amador, the painter Marin-Busqued, the art critic Margarita Nelken, Ruth Rivera etc. The Soviets were there headed by Amkuxaragm Bazarov and Kazanteev, present also by the name of/Tchmikov, Valentin Loguinov, Tchmikov is a young man, about thirty five, speake very good Spanish and has a rather nice wife. He invitedus to attend the exhibition of a film, a russian film at the embassy the next day, he also whatwe were leaving said that we had to go to his house soon and have a real russian dinner. This kind of invitation is most unusual. I do not remember any other sovietico suggesting such a thing.

In the party there were the usual diplomatic crowd which at ends parties of representations behind the Iron Curtain, Max Wery, the Belginn ambassador and his wife, the French ambassador and his wife, the French Counsellor la Tour du Pin and his wife, the architect Lopez Malo who is one of the directors of the Comité Organizador de los Juegos Olimpicos, the italian ambassador and one of his daughters, the Uruguayan ambassador, the Chilean ambassador and Enrique Cobo del Campo the cousellor of the same embassy, the cuban ambassador Joaquin Hernandez Armas with whom we talked about Venezuela and told me that it was an stupid thing to accuse a country of trying to invade another country with half a dozen men. The chechs had plenty of beer brought checoslova-

quia but mixed it with just as much mexican beer if you were not
careful. The Brazilian ambassador was there, Guillermo Gimenes
Ramirez the charge of Costa Rica, Gonzalo Almeida Urrutia, the
ambassador from Ecuador, from the Foreign Office, Muñoz Zapata and
Flores Tejada. I do not remember seeing anybody from the US, but
I arrived somewhat late, Kai Somerto the ambassador from Finland
was present and so was the mayor general Natahn Aferi from Ghana,
the ambassador was most friendly as well as Jan Hant the commercial
counsellor and Jiri Suestran Svestka the second secretory in
charge o the consulat.

Next day we went to the Soviet embassy for the exhibition of
a fil whose title I think was the Father of the Soldier, a rather
childish film but that brought tears to the eyes of some of the
embassy wives who attended. There was an small group of people,
including tonse army officers from the Secretary de la Defensa,
and Amiral Azanar Cetina, subsecretario de marina, and amiral
Otal Briceño, who after a long illness has now some new post in
Marina. All the Soviet staff was present, there were two or three
cuban including Curvello. There was a change, the doors of the
embassy were wide open and there was no question by the people
at the maxm outside door, inside Frygov and other fellow received
the visitors. There was as usual plenty ofniček vodka, axaxmm small
eats but no caviar, both thing were served before and after the
exhibition of the film film.

On the 17th of may we went to a reception for the National day
of Noruega. They have a beautiful house in Monte Carpatos which
had been built for the embassy along their norweigian style; the
new ambassador is a tall gaurt, strange man, there were not many
people because there was a diplomatic lunch at Relaciones and

white film of the Opympics to Rom rez Vasquez. No Indian around. No Greekreither. Chacha Valdes, formerly de Lanz Duret, with her new husband, licenciado Lozano. She if the owner of Universal. He was nobody until he married, now he is a well known jurist.

Prancisco Aguera Cenarro, the director of Revista Internacional, trying to impress the French ambassador with the fact that he had printed an editorial on Israel if his magazine. Revista Internacional has a circulation of about fivehundred copies, but gives *Aguera* a good ten thousand pesos a month.

It was a fairly good party as far as diplomatic parties go, but sterile in results. Nobody appeared to *worry* very much about the war in the East, and some *people* like the Paraguayn and the Tobias Eguizabal had the idea that everything had been prepared in advance by the United States and the URSS.

That there had been a meeting in which the question had been atteted.

Loguinov called me to the office to tell me he had tickets for me and my wife for the Bolshoi ballet for Sunday night. We had been unable to secure anything at the office.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

On Sunday 11 June, Valentin Losuinov was able to obtain for us two good tickets for the Ballet Bolshoi at Bellas Artes and afterwards we went to have something to eat at Lady Baltimore in Madero Street. Very few people were there, which is not surprising in view of the bad quality of their food and poor service. But it was the nearest spot for a quick bite.

Loguinov was very much interested in knowing what my US friends thought about the situation in the Middle East and what they would do about it. He was insistent about the possible help that the US would give to Israel, he said that the US had already given Israel a considerable amount of ammunition and planes, and specially money, the URSS had to give some help to the arabs in view of the help given to Israel. According to him there was not the slighest doubt that Israel had been the agressor. The URSS would never consent to any territorial gains by Israel..

During our conversation about food, specially about seafood he let it be know that he had been in Mazatlán several times.

He said that everything which had taken place in the Middle East had been plotted in advance by the US and Israel.

DATE OF MEETING:

3 June 1967

1.  After a long hiatus, I called Subject on ca 14 May and learned he was out of the country. I called him again on 6 June and we made a date for 8 June. The meeting was in the breakfast room of the Del Paseo Hotel from 0810 to 0915. The next meeting is at the same place at 0830 on 15 June.

2.  Subject was all excited about the Israel/Arab conflict and we spent the best part of the meeting discussing it.

3.  He said that LOGINOV called him on 3 June and pressed for a lunchoon date the same day. Subject put him off until 8 June. LOGINOV wanted news on the local Jewish reaction, was everybody behind the Jews, was money being contributed, etc. Subject who was madder than hell about Soviet support of the Arabs gave him holl and to direct questions got the admissions from LOGINOV that the Israelis vere acting in self-defense and that the Americans and British were not providing the Israelis air cover. LOGINOV mentioned that he would go to the USSR on home leave in July.

4.  On 6 June Miriam AVILA Kats, who is also very excited sbout the war and who told Subject that she had gone to the Israeli Embassy to volunteer to serve in Israel, told Subject that when she returned home on the evening of 5 June, LOGINOV was waiting for her on the street. His purpose vas the same as wanting to see Bubject, to pump her on local reactions to the war. She also gave LOGINOV hell.

5.  She then told Subject that in Holy Week she had been called to the American Embassy and had been asked about her contact with LOGINOV. She said that she had seen the same American (no name given) about two weeks ago. She then told Subject that LOGINOV had asked her to introduce him to "one of her progressive. friends" or "someone in the U.S. Embassy" as a return for the favor of issuing a visa to Dr. Yuriy KUTLER.

6.  The above is a capsule account of her relationship with LEVENDERIS. I played innocent until I got the whole story but finally admitted that we had talked to her when he asked, "if it wasn't you, who?" I told him that AVILA had notidea that Subject was in contact with us and had in fact worried that her activities (future) might hurt him which she was definitely against.

7.  It appears that AVILA told Subject about us because of LOGINOV's appearance on 5 June and her emotional state about the war. I will discuss this further with Subject at the next meeting, particularly what advice he has or will give her about cooperating with us.

CONTACT REFORT

SUBJECT: Miriam AVILA Katz P-581

DATE OF HEATING: 11 May 1967

1. My last meeting with Subject was on 23 March, at
   which time she agreed to provide information on LOGINOV
   obtained during their normal business contact and any further
   social contact initiated by him. She was to call me after
   their next date or any other significant contact she had with
   him. Since I had not heard from her, I called her at her
   apartment about 2115 on 11 May. I apologized for calling so
   late, but said I had just got out of work and had a package.
   for her I had brought back from the States which I wanted
   to deliver before the contents got stale. Could I drop over
   that night or perhaps another evening. Subject immediately
   recognized the "package" as the Benson and Hedges cigarettes
   I had promised her, gently protested, and then told me she
   was not feeling well, but the doctor had told her she had
   to eat, and it so happened she was just going out for a bite
   when I called. I consequently suggested we have dinner together,
   which we did from 21115-1215 at the Gondola. Afterwards, wo
   went around the corner to her apartment for a nightcap until
0200. 
2. Subject had lost 8 or 10 pounds and looked a bit thin
   and not as attractive as I had remembered her. She told me
   she was simoly working too hard and not eating and sleeping
   properly. I had some fear that she might have had come second

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 21

thoughts in the seven weeks since she had agreed to cooperate,
but it proved unfounded. She this time was relaxed from the
start, was very friendly, and seemed to enjoy the opportunity
to get out. (She later told me in her apartment that she didn't
go out much, liked to spend her evenings at home reading,
listening to records, tending to her dwarf trees, etc.) She
made it clear from the start that she hadn't changed her mind
by warning me half-seriously and half-playfully that I shouldn't
think I could "buy" her with gifts. "You've bought me up here,"
she said, tapping her head with her forefinger. "That's
the only way you'll get anywhere with me." Most of the evening
"was spent in general and (especially back at her apartment)
increasingly fuzzy discussion of Israel, the Jews, her job,
the Russians "as people," her very humanistic philosophy about
lie, and I don't exactly remember what else. She is definitely
a smart girl, but I think less profound and sophisticated than
she tries to appear. Otherwise, she seems to be a very sincere
person, and she has given me no reason to doubt or suspect
anything she has told me.

### 3. Contact with LOGINOV.

Subject said she hadn't been
out with LOGINOV since our last meeting and had had only one
face-to-face contact with him. She said this was a little
over a month ago (early April) and was occasioned by her
efforts to help a client by the name of Dr. Yury KUTTLER get
a Soviet visa. She said ETTLER is & dentist and definitely
a Communist sympathizer, if not a Communist. (KUTTLER has
F-File 1573.) KUTTLER evidently thought he was liked by the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

Russians in return, as he initially tohi Subject he was expecting an official Soviet invitation to visit the USSR. As it turned out, however, he nau a naça time even getting a Soviet visa, Subject finally called LOGINOV herself to try to push things along, but LOGINOV showed no willingness to facilitate things. (LIENVOY has Subject on the phone to LOGINOV on 5 April. After discussing KUTTLER's case, Subject, remarked to LOGINOV that she understood that "you (ustedes) must have some reason not to want to give him (KUTTLER) the visa." LOGINOV replied that there were "reasons enough.")

4. A day or two after her telephone conversation with LOGINOV, Subject said she went over to the Soviet Embassy personally to see if she could get anywhere with LOGINOV. LOGINOV received her cordially, and for the first time asked her into his office (she said it was the first office off the outside Reception Room). She again asked LOGINOV to try to s speed up the granting of KUTTLER's visa. LOGINOV hemmed and hawed, indicating that he wasn't even sure the visa would be granted. He finally told Subject that look, he had gone to KUTTLER for dental work once, and KUTTLER had charged him muon too much. Consequently, he said, he wasn't going to give him a visa. Subject said she could not tell if the destist bill was the real reason for LOGINOV's negative attitude, but when she persisted, LOGINOV finally relented and the following exchange ensued:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

LOGINOV: "All right, Miriam, I'll do it for you (i.e., give KUTTLER the visa). But you know, a favor must be repaid by a favor."

Subject: "All right....in that case, let me in the name of the company invite you to dinner."

LOGINOV: "No, Miriam, I don't mean that."

LOGINOV then went on to say that as he had mentioned to her before, he would like her to introduce him to "someone who would be sympathetic to us" (i.e., to the Soviets). LOGINOV emphasized that he realized Subject might not agree with this "someone's" ideas, but stated that he knew Subject was the type of person who "had respect for other people's views." Subject said that she replied in a casual, almost flippant manner that "well, sure, if she met such a person, she'd introduce them." With this the subject was dropped and Subject left.

5. LICOZY-5. Subject on her own initiative began telling me what a terrific guy her boss is. He according to her, has one of the most winning personalities of anyone she has ever met. At the same time he is extremely intelligent and shrewd. "If he can't get what he wants through charm, he does it by pure shrewdness." This is why he is such a successful businessman.

In reply to a question about LICOZY-5's background, Subject said he had been born in Foland, was imprisoned by either the Toles or Germans just before or during World War II (she was rather vague on this point, and I confined myself to listening), somehow got out and joined the Russians, taking part in the Soviet invasion of Germany. Somehow he had survived all this, made his way to Mexico, where he arrived penniless, and now


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

must have a small fortune in the bank. He vividly remembers his former hardships, however, is a very generous and humane person, and every year sends clothes to people in Foland and Russia. He also has a very strong feeling for Israel. Obviously he couldn't have survived a life like this if he weren't shrewd. He has no love for the Russians, but was not above joining them to assure his own survival in World War II and can be agreeable enough toward them to retain their travel business. Subject gave absolutely no indication that she had said anything to LICOZY-5 about me.

6. The conversation was the most relaxed as well as the fuzziest back at Subject's apartment, where we finished a bottle of vodka LOGINOV had given LICOZY-5 and LICOZY-5 had given her. Back on the subject of LOGINOV, Subject said she "supposed" he had tried to cultivate a lot of girls like herself..."hadn't her?" (I had told Subject at our last meeting that young women were among LOGINOV's favorite targets, but hadn't been able to tell what effect this "revelation" had on her. Now it appeared that it had hit home and that it had wounded her pride to think he not only had had ulterior motives in dating her, but had dated other girls the same way.) I didn't reply directly, but said something about LOGINOV being as smooth as they come. Subject wasn't satisfied with this, however, and pressed me: "lie has tried the same thing with other girls, hasn't he?"". "Yes, Miriam, several," I finally said. This seemed to satisfy her.

7. Shortly thereafter, I asked Subject if LOGINOV were

LEAIM's account of his first two meetings with LOGUINOV. It appears to me that at the second meeting, 26 April, he moved in a lot faster than is customary with the Sovs. For this reason I wonder if possibly the Soviets are deliberately trying to get a look at him independent from LEONOV, who may well have been reporting regularly his meetings with Lin.

He understands he is not to be dangled in front of Sovs, and I told him that after today's tennis match, he is to make himself unavailable for two or three weeks for tennis (or the movies) and see what kind of initiative. L is prepared to take.

This would, however, allow us to plant an American girl at the French Club if we wished and play her into L's hands. Will discuss with Paul when he returns.

VALENTIN S. LOGUINOV

1.  Contact. First not April 22, 1967. He asked my wife and D if he and an American born Koxican friend could join us in doubles. Saturdays the tennis courses are filled. I was reluctant at first until I recognil his accent and suspected that he was one of two persons for whom I have pictures on file.

2.  Utility. Consul of the USSR embassy.

3.  Susceptibility. Eager to visit to U.S. Possibly interested in the material things of life, possibly overly interested in girls. Seems convinced of the value of Marxian.

4.  Personality. Very friendly and direct. Wishes his embassy enjoyal club privileges such as the U.S. at the Reforma Club. He likes caviar, vodka, and drinks several beers quickly. He is a little demonstrative in gestures of head and hands. It is too early to equate his gestures with his attitudes or the topics being discussed.

5.  English. He is eager to improve his English, which he speaks rather poorly. His son Dmitry speaks only Russian, no Spanish or English.

6.  Biodata. His daughter, 14, is in an English school in Moscow.

7.  Chess. Plays, but not a fan.

8.  Athletics. He plays excellent tennis for someone who claims he has played less than a year and never more than once a week. He has the face, build, and carriage of a trained athlete. He has the brutish look of a boxer or wrestler. He has the grace of a natural athlete. I would guess him to be unusually strong. He boxed when younger, plays basket-ball and volleyball.

9.  Spanish. Speaks good Spanish. Studied for one year in Moscow.

10. Desire for contact. Val proposed that we meet regularly for tennis at 1600 hours every Wednesday. He asked if it bothered me to be seen with a Soviet. He said many U.S. diplomats seemed to shun him. He also suggested that we not limit our contacts to tennis but that we go to a movie sometime with our wives.

11. Bio-data. Apparently has limited income. Ho has no servant, no TV, no tolophono.

12. Leonova. Val seemed somewhat cool about the Leonovs. Naturally ho knows them, but doesn't seem to consider them friends.

13. Personality. Does not smoke.

14. U.S. Trip. Val is going to Moscow in July. Ho wants to spend 2 to 3 days in New York. Ho said he had read much about New York but wanted to see it for himself.

April 23, 1967. P.M.

1. Contact. Upon leaving the club, we saw and greeted Val at poolside watching his son swim. He reminded me about our Wednesday date.

April 26, 1967. 1600 hours

1. Contact. Our tennis date.

2. Information.

A. My access? Val asked if I had occasion to go to the U.S. embassy and if I know anyone in the embassy. I answered no to both.

B. FBI. Val was still concerned about my innocence and lack of fear in being seen with a Soviet. I joked about not seeing any FBI in the area. Ho blushed and said he really knew that there were very many FBI agents here.

C. Embassy telephone. Val requested that I not use his embassy phone number on his calling card. He explained that he is all over the embassy and that it is difficult to locate him.

D. American girls. Val asked me if I knew any American girls here. He suggested I bring two for our tennis date. He wants to meet U.S. girls to practice his English. He said that in one year here he has failed

No specific information has been received concerning the travel of the individuals mentioned in referenced letter.

Reliable sources, including, Vice Consul Richard Booth, American Consulate, Veracruz, have advised that Mexican authorities are exercising strict control over visiesto Soviet vessels and trips ashore by members of the crews. Loginov recently met Booth at Lopez Hermanos, shipping agents, and asked Booth if he could do something about the refusal of Mexican officials to permit crew members to come-ashore.

Kodak to give English lessons. It was agreed they'd discuss the matter further when Subject (not to be left out of a good thing) visited TROCONIS at Kodak to take advantage of that 30-40% discount. Subject even wanted to get me some film at these fabulous prices, but I said I didn't need any at the moment. I did say, however, that any relationship that developed between TROCONIS and the Soviets would naturally be of interest to us and I'd like to have Subject remain alert to anything he heard from either the Soviets or TROCONIS. Subject said he would. LOGINOV As previously reported, Subject has seen LOGINOV on numerous occasions on the Embassy grounds and in the first office off the Reception Room. They usually exchange greetings in English. On 30 March, LOGINOV came up to Subject in the Reception Room and said that he'd like to speak to Subject about English lessons for his 8-year-old son. Subject said fine, and it was agreed Subject would drop into LOGINOV's office (i.e., off the Reception Room) when he was through with his classes that afternoon. When Subject returned about 1830, however, LOGINOV was just getting ready to leave and it was agreed they'd try to get together another time. They finally did so on 11 April. Subject went to LOGINOV's office about 1830 and stayed 15 or 20 minutes. LOGINOV in a very relaxed and casual manner, explained that he had an 8 year old son whom he wanted to learn English. He said the boy knew no English and very little Spanish. He stated that they were going to Moscow on vacation in July and would be back in August, and he consequently didn't want to begin the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 40

lessons until they returned, but he wanted to tentatively
explore the matter with Subject now. He stated--in English--
that he would like Subject "to go to teach" the boy, the
implication being, according to Subject, that the lessons
were to be given at LOGINOV's home. If Subject couldn't
give the boy lessons when it came time, LOGINOV said he hoped
Subject would be able to recommend someone else. Subject said
he'd be happy to teach the boy if he had time, but that it was
of course too early to know whether he would be able to fit
him into his schedule in August. LOGINOV said he understood
and they could talk in specifics in August. LOGINOV added
only that he planned to pick up a special text (or set of
texts) for teaching children English when he was in Moscow.

5. Subject said that LOGINOV had a pile of perhaps 30-35
   passports on his desk on 11 April. Subject commented on
   LOGINOV's apparently heavy work load, and LOCINOV rerlied
   casually: "Well, you know there are a lot of people who want
   to visit the Soviet Union." He continued that most of the
   passports on his desk were Mexican, but "several" were American.
   He then began shuffling through the pile until he came to one
   belonging to an American girl. He opened the passport to
   her picture and showed it to Subject as an illustration.
   Subject said he couldn't make out the name, but the picture
   was of a good-looking, blondish girl who appeared to be 23
   or 24 years old. This was the only passport LOGINOV showed
   Subject, and the conversas topic was thereupon dropped. At
   the end of the conversation, LOGINOV stated that he certainly
   would appreciate it if Subject could teach his son and he'd


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 41

get together again with Subject in August.

6. I asked Subject if he thought he would have time to teach the boy. Subject said it was impossible to tell, but he could probably make time if we considered it important enough. I told Subject there was a good chance we would and in any case not to give LOGINOV a negative answer before consulting me. I explained that LOGINOV was KGB and one of the most able mer in the Embassy, and warned Subject to be on his toes in his relations with him.

7. Subject conducted 11 classes at the Soviet Embassy during the reporting period.

28 March

1545-1700 -- BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, ROMANCHENKO

1700-1815 -- KAZANTSEV. BAZAROV and his wife were supposed to have their first class from 1700-1830, but KAZANTSEV said the Ambassador was too busy. No mention was made of his wife. (The BAZAROVS' classes are scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays from 1700-1830. Classes for KAZANTSEV, BEDRIN, GONCHARENKO, and ROMANCHENKO are scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays.)

1700-1800 KAZANTSEV. KAZANTSEV said that BAZAROV expected to be tied up with the Soviet Petroleum Congress delegation and probably would not be able to make his 1700-1830 class on Friday, the 31st. If not, KAZANTSEV said, GONCHARENKO would use the time, since he was somewhat behind BFDR IN and ROMANCHENKO.

SUBJECT: Ernst GOEBEL

DATE OF MEETING: 10 April 1967

1. I met Subject at his office from 1845 to 1915 on 10 April 1967. My purpose was to see if he knew Herbert Adolf PELKA (P). Subject said that he didn't know either PELKA or the two German witnesses to his marriage. However he does have a friend, a secretary at Telefunken, where PELKA works. He will check this girl and elicit information on PELKA.

2. Subject reported that he had noticed that Ralph WIEGANDT has become quite friendly at the French Club as a tennis partner of LOGINOV. (COMMENT: Per LIENVOY WIEGANDT and wife invited LOGINOV to dinner in March 1967). WIEGANDT is a German who came to Mexico after WW II. He formerly worked for Rieboldt Chemical in Germany. His wife is from a well-known German-Mexican family from Guadalajara, nee BAHNSEN. His father is a Dr. of chemistry from Stuttgart who recently came to Mexico. WIEGANDT owns or has a controlling interest in Barnices Aislantes, S.A., located at Avenida Tolteca 176. This company manufactures plastic foam insulating materials. He lives in Coyoacan in a house which he recently had built, Europa 26. Subject dislikes WIEGANDT whom he describes as a pushy, ambitious businessman. The implication is that he is unscrupulous and would do anything for a buck. Subject doesn't know anything about his politics. Subject will obtain more background information on him.

DATE OF MEETING: 23 March 1967 (La Pergola Restaurant, 1400-1615)

1. Subject works at Mundos Tours, where she is in charge of travel to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In this job, sha deals with LOGINOV on visa matters. However, as far back as June 1966, LIENVOY indicated the existence of something more than simply a business relationship between them. Then in January 1967, Paul Dillon elicited from LICOZY-5 the information that Subject definitely had a social relationship with LOGINOV, as well as some basic biographic data: she was about 25 or 25 years old, a Mexican citizen with a Mexican father and "Jewish" mother, intelligent, definitely not pro-Soviet, and had gone to college for two years in the United States. The problem in arranging a meeting with her was to do so in such a way that she would be either disinclined or unable to say anything to LICOZY-5 or anyone else about the meeting before it took place. It was hoped that at the meeting she could be persuaded to keep the contact to herself.

2. Learning on 23 March that Mundos. Tours was closed that day and that LICOZY-5 was out of town, I called Subject at her apartment that morning about 1115. I identified myself as an officer at the American Embassy, stated there was a matter on which I thought she might be able to be of some help to the Embassy, and asked if she by any chance were free to have lunch with me that day, or, if not, *************

if we could arrange something else. Subject professed dismay that the American Eribassy even knew she existed, let alone that she could possibly be of any help to the Embassy. She then became very defensive and only reluctantly agreed to meet me for lunch at the Pergola Restaurant at 1400. The Pergola is just a few blocks from her apartment.

3. Subject was waiting for me in front of the restaurant when I arrived a couple of minutes before the hour. I found a trim, stylishly dressed young woman with glasses and long, dark hair pulled straight back from her forehead. The glasses, exposed forehead, and hair style gave her a sophisticated look which turned out to perfectly express her personality. She did not at first strike me as particularly attractive, but this was probably because she was tensed up to the point that she was pale and expressionless and actually trembled slightly when we first spoke. I later found her, especially when she took off her glasses, to be quite attractive, and it is reasonable to assume that LOGINOV is attracted by more than her personality.

4. The first 15 minutes were tough going. Subject was defensive to the point of hostility and totally unresponsive to efforts to break through to her on a personal level. Fortunately, she agreed to a drink before asking flatly what it was I wanted I replied directly but in a friendly manner that through routine investigation, it had come to our attention that she had a social relationship with Valentin LOGINOV.. I continued that while her personal life normally wouldn't be of any concern to the American Embassy, the fact was that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City was a major base for espionage and subversion against both


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 47

# COPIES MADE

Mexico and the United States and that LOGINOV was one of the Soviets' most able and active intelligence officers. One of the areas where he was most active, I continued, was in establishing relationships with young women like herself. For this purpose, I said, he used various lines, alternatively telling girls he was unmarried, divorced, or that his wife was in the Soviet Union. (This brought the first expression of any kind from Subject, who smiled faintly when I mentioned his using the line that his wife was in the USSR. According to LICOZY-5, this is what LOGINOV had told Subject.) Encouraged by the fact that Subject was at least listening, I went further into the seriousness of the Soviet presence in Mexico, hitting hard the fact that the Soviets treatened the security of both the U.S. and Mexico, individually and collectively. When I finished, I told Subject that I was telling her all this both so that she would know whom she was dealing with in LOGINOV and because I frankly hoped that understanding the situation, she would be willing to discuss LOGINOV with me.

5. To my disappointment, Subject replied with undiminished defensiveness that all right, she had gone out with LOGINOV a few times. Because of her job as head of East Füuropean travel at Mundos Tours, she had met and had to deal with: LOGINOV on visa matters. One day he had casually asked if she were free that night and had invited her out. He had always been helpful to her and she felt it was good business to accept the invitation. In all, she had gone out with him "three or four times"--usually to dinner, the movies, a coffee nightcap, and then "always


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 48

straight home." She admittedly enjoyed his company. She considered herself "an intelligent person," and wouldn't go out with just anybody. He too nad to be intelligent and had to be an enjoyable companion. LOGINOV fit this bill. He was "extremely intelligent," very considerate, an interesting conversationalist, completely unlike the usual ill-mannered, boorish Soviet. But that's all there was to their relationship. That's absolutely all there was to it. They never discussed politics, and even if LOGINOV wanted to do so, she'd refuse, because she had absolutely no interest in politics. She had her own life to lead, and what one side said made no more dent in her than what the other side said. Reflecting for a moment on the above, Subject then added almost disgustedly that when she began seeing LOGINOV she had more or lessed expected that her name would wind up in the American Embassy's files.

6. Subject said all of the above as though she were on the stand and showed no intention of volunteering any more. I consequently felt there was not much more I could do with her and that I had foreclosed any possibilities there might have been with the wrong approach, whatever the right one may have been. Moreover, at this moment, a well-dressed Mexican who looked to be in his early 30's came up to the table, greeted Subject, and invited himself to sit down. Subject, apparently as surprised as I, introduced him as Alejandro ALVAREZ (no Station traces) of ALVAREZ AUTOMOTRIZ, a local firm which makes springs for Volkswagens. Subject told me later that his father owns the business. Alejandro, according to Subject, had once been her professor in an accounting course at business school


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 49

49. 
# COPIES MADE

here in Mexico City. Subject also said that Alejandro and his
firm were good customers of Mundos Tours, and that Alejandro
had in fact just recently returned from a three week trip to
Germany. He spoke some English.

7. The appearance of ALVAREZ, who by now was ordering his
   first of two martinis, seemed to end any remaining chances of
   getting anywhere with the girl. As it worked out, however,
   his appearance had just the opposite effect, because it provided
   more than an hour of conversation on an increasingly friendly
   and personal level. By her second drink, Subject was even
   managing a few laughs. Eventually we got onto the subject.of
   Israel, which, thanks to the information supplied by LICOZY-5,
   I knew she had visited and had become romantically involved
   with, she herself being half Jewish. I expressed considerable
   interest in her trip and Israel in general, and she seemed
   delighted to tell me about both. It then turned out that her
   mother--who Subject said is a U.S. citizen--had lived in Moldavia,
   had told her daughter vivid stories of pogroms carried out by
   the Russians against the Jews, and had fled Rumania before the
   invading Russians (evidently during World War II.) The fact
   that I had been in Rumania and Moldavia was good for another
   ten minutes of conversation and seemed to impress Subject far
   beyond its worth. In any event, by the time ALVAREZ left,
   Subject and I were on a first name basis and she was telling me
   how glad she was she had met me--all of which I attribute to
   luck (ALVAREZ, who even quietly paid the check when leaving) and
   dubonnet cocktails.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

COPIES MADE

8. During the above conversation, we also discussed the United States, including President Kennedy, whom both Subject and ALVAREZ claimed greatly to have admired, and Subject's experience in the U.S., where she attended Kont State University in Ohio. She stated at this time that she regarded the U.S. as a second home. She also expressed love for Mexico and together with ALVAREZ, took pride in pointing to Mexico's progress.

9. Following ALVAREZ's departure, Subject looked at me as though I were a bad dog or something and asked in a scolding tone how I could have ever suspected her of cooperating with LOGINOV. No, she just couldn't understand it. I replied that I hadn't suspected her and reminded her that I hadn't said I did. I then said more seriously that there was one thing tha t bothered me, however. On the one hand, she told me she loved Mexico and regarded the U.S. as her second country; yet on the other, she claimed to be totally apolitical. The Soviets in Mexico, I repeated, were working to undermine both countries, and proceeded to go over again much of what I had said earlier. I stated that it was incredible to me that Soviet activities in. Mexico didn't make any difference to her. I had contacted her, I said, not because I had any suspicion of her, but because from the little I knew of her I had hoped she'd cooperate in helping us learn more about LOGINOV and his activities in Mexico. Subject thereupon protested that there was nothing more she could tell me. She had told me everything worth telling about their association. Moreover, she hadn't seen him since, Christmas time. LOGINOV was smart, never talked about anything sensitive, and could probably never be induced to do so. The only thing


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 51

COPIES MADE

he had ever asked her of an even remotely suspicious or Interesting nature was whether she had any friends at the American Embassy. She said she had replied tartly that she had friends everywhere, and that LOGINOV hadn't bothered her with such questions since. In short, she didn't see how she could be of any help. I replied that since it was I who need the help, this was for me to decide, that whether she liked it or not she was in contact with an important Soviet intelligence officer who was of great interest to the United States, and that now that I knew her better, I was confident she had the intelligence and judgment to help us. I did not want to interfere in any way in her personal life. Nor did I really want her to do anything in the sense that she would have to go out of her way. All I wanted was that she be as observant as possible during her normal contacts and dates with LOGINOV, to try to see into the man, what made him tick, what his problems were, whether he was satisfied with his work, how he liked to relax, what did he enjoy, what did he want, etc. Then after each substantial contact, most probably a date, I'd like to have the opportunity to sit down with over lunch or wherever it be and discuss her observations. This was all I was asking. All right, if that's all I wanted, she'd do it.

10. There was, I said, one thing I wanted to impress on her: if we were to obtain any worthwhile results, one thing was essential... Subject nodded at this point and interrupted: "I know...keep quiet." I emphasized that this meant with everyone, indluding her family, her friends, her boss and her co-workers. Subject assured me that she could be relied upon.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

52. 
COPIES MADE

11. Contact Arrangements. Subject-agreed to call me to
    set up a luncheon date after her next date with LOGINOV. We
    will meet at the entrance to the Pergola at the time and date
    specified. I gave her the 870 extension and asked that she use
    the name "Mary" when calling.

12. There are clearly two essentials if Subject is to
    develop into a worthwhile asset. First she is going to have to
    come up with more interesting observations than simply that
    LOGINOV is smart. She may be able to do this by becoming a
    more diligent and careful observer--which I think she is
    capable of--or it may require an effort on her part to develop
    a closer relationship with LOGINOV. One possibility in the
    latter direction is to prevail upon her to become more intimate
    with LOGINOV than she now appears to be. On the basis of
    LICOZY-5's opinion that she probably sleeps around, this might
    be possible, although it is much too early to say. Second,
    Subject must prove cooperative. She strikes me as a very independent
    and strong-willed person, and there is no guarantee she won't
    change herain her mind or do only what she feels like doing.

It is also possible that in a moment of reconsideration, she
might confide in LICOZY-5, in which case her credibility would
become tangled with his.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: BESABER

DATE OF MEETING: 7 March 1967

1. Operational: Met BESABER at his hotel room in Del Paseo for breakfast. Meet lasted from 0800-0920. Next meet will be after Easter.

2. Substance

a. BEWEEP: BEWERP phoned BESABER on Friday, 3 March 1967 to invite himself, his wife and the RZADZINSKI couple down for the day on 5 March. They arrived on 5 March at about1100, atayed until 1700.

b. BESABER reported that Mrs. RZADZINSKA is three months pregnant (by her admission) and that he, BESABER, thinks that BEWEEP is the father. He cited the following as evidence :

(1) The RZADZINSKIS admitted they they had been married for over five years, yet this is her first pregnancy.

(2) Mr. RZADZINSKI was totally unattentive to Mrs. R. ERSABER and his wife assume that after so many years of waiting for a child, Mr. R. should have shown more concern for and interest in his wife.

(3) Likewise, Mr. R. was totally disinterested in the fact that he is about to become a father.

(4) BEWEEP, on the other hand, showed concern for Mrs. R. when she went to sleep in the sun. Twice he suggested that Mr. R. wake her up so she would not get burned. He didn't.

(5) Mrs. R. appeared interested in BEWEEP. When họ vent swimming Mrs. R followed, proceeded to jump on him and frolic in the water. Mrs. R. paid no attention at all.

(6) Mrs. R. sat next to BEWEEP at lunch (on purpose), kept looking at BEWEEP lovingly.

(7) BEWEEP, possibly embarrassed by all the attention Mrs. R. vas showing him, mado some very complimentary remarks about his wife. Mrs. BEWEEP, who apparently was completely oblivious to what BESABER and his wife thought was so obvious in the BEWEEP/Mrs. R. relationship, was obviously very pleased

but surprised, to hear her husband speaking about her in such a complimentary way. She asked incredulously whether he really meant what he said and when BEWEEP reiterated with some embarrassment that he thought she was the best wife in the world, Mrs. BEWEKP covered with confusion but happy said that this was the first time he had ever said such kind things about hter, the first time she had been aware that he really did think she was a good wife.

(8) BEWEEP seemed relaxed enough, but different. On several occasions when political matters came up, usually raised by Mr. R., he changed the subject, once asked Mr. R. admost rudely, "Don't you have anything better than politics to talk about."

(9) Mrs. BKWEEP said that the two comples had been in the habit of going off on weekends together, BESABER supposed that BEWEEP may have done the deed during one of their outings.

c. In private conversation with BESABER, Mrs. BEWEEP asked if BESABERhad heard from BESETON. Whon BESABIR said he had not, Mrs. BEWEEP said that her husband had told her BESETON VAS in Colombia (SLINKARD had told BEWEEP this). She then went on to say that BESETON was the nicest man in the world. "I don't know what he is, but he's the nicest man in the world." "He introduced us to another American (obviously SLINKARD) whom we see often, but it's not the samo."

d. Mrs. BEWEEP, still alone with BESABER, was very complimentary towards the U. S. She said the U. S. was made for women, the merchandise, the packaging, the stores, etc. Moreover, the people are all nice.

e. Joined by BEWEEP, Mrs. BEWEEP got off on the Russians. She explained that it was difficult to understand the Russians since she, as a Pole, belonging to the Western Cultural traditions, held so many different views about life in general. She was apparently particularly thinking of the sense of distrust in the Russian mentality. She said that the Russians here in the Embassy simply could not believe that the two daughters of the former Polish Ambassador, Jerzy GRUDZINSKI, had been permitted to stay on in Mexico after their XXXNXNX father's recall last year.

f. Mrs. BEWEEP told Mrs. BESABER that she was not teaching geography at the Embassy to the children of the officials.

g. BEWEEP told BESABER that he thought he would remain in Mexico until the first few months of 1969, but certainly until after the Olympics of the fall of 1968.

h. Tenon RZADZINSKI and wife - In addition to the information above noted regarding R. and his wife, the BESABERS picked up the following:

(1) RZADZINSKI was previously stationed in Vietnam as a member of the ICC (interpreter). He speaks good English and his Spanish, although not as good, is understandable.

(2) R. doesn't understand why the Americans are carrying out the war they way they are. Without in any way criticizing the American position, he did say that he found it unbelievable that they did not destroy the port of Haiphong.

(3) R. had contact with Amercans in Vietnam. XM He spent one month at the Danang air base, apparently enjoyed it.

(4) R. did not get off on politics, possibly because BEWEEP apparently did not want to talk about such subjects.

3. Comments

We have no information to substantiate the BESABERS supposition that BEWEEP is the father of Mrs. R's expected child. I told BESABER this. It may be true, but to have any operational significance, we would almost have to prove it.

4. Plans

a. I asked BESABER to arrange a lunch with BEWEEP in the near future to try to see if there was anything more to the above supposition. (Lunch now set up for 4 April).

b. Tentatively, BESABER will invite LOGINOV to Cuernavaca for 8 or 9 April to look at houses (for Sov Embassy retreat) and play tennis at Colonel Higgins (whom I will brief as soon as I can get hold of him).

Loguinov in town in connection with the visiting Russian ships, called the Consulate on February 27, wanting to talk to the Consul, who was out of town, but showed no interest in talking to the Vice Consul. On February 28, a local shipping agent introduced Loguinov to the Vice Consul. Loguinov complained of the lack of hospitality shown to the Soviet scientific ship by Mexican authorities, comparing this with the magnificent reception the ship had received in San Francisco; he even asked if the American Consulate didn't have some relationship with Mexican immigration authorities, implying that we might be able to help them. Loguinov, who was very cordial, said he had been in Mexico City a year and half and lived there with his family. He seemed about six feet tall, with short, reddish-blond hair, and spoke fluent Spanish with Russian accent.

No Communist ships are known to have entered Coatzacoalcos harbor since those mentioned in pgh. 3 of the referenced airgram. Further information is not yet available on those ships.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact with BESABER

DATE OF MEETINGS: 23 and 28 February 1967

A. Operational

1. As arranged by phone CO met BESABER in latter's room at the Hotel Del Paseo, dates 23 and 28 February. Mrs. BESABER was present at the second meet. BESABER plans to be in Mexico City on 9 March and will call to arrange meet.

B. Finances

1. CO picked up BESABER's accounting for revolving fund. I'll reimburse him at next meet.

C. Substance

1. Soviets - At about 1000 on 18 February Vladimir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH (P-8167) phoned BESABER from Cuernavaca. BESABER had never met him before. S explained he friend of Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (P-11712), that L unable to make it because some people had arrived in town. S showed interest in buying some of BESABER's products, therefore BESARER asked him to come to factory. S arrived with wife and young girl who works in the Embassy (18-19 years old, tall, good figure, dark brown hair, spoke Spanish, she wore kerchief) - this probably Tatyana MARKINA (P-12945).

2. 3 brought almost 2000 pesos worth of stuff including two large screens. BESABER opines that this was not personal purchase, but rather either for the Embassy or operational expense deal. 8 also insisted that purchases be delivered to Embassy, not his house.

3. 8 invited BESABER and wife to Army Day reception at the Soviet Embassy (28 Feb 1967), saying that he had forgotten to bring written invitation but that it would be at the gate of the Embassy (BESABER was reluctant to go and I thought it better for him to not appear overly eager so he did not go.)

4. Before leaving (they stayed about 45 minutes) 8 told MESABER that is would probably come to Cuernavaca the following day, Sunday about noon. (he didn't.)

5. After S, wife and M had left BESABER picked up a girl and drove to the Arosena (phonetic) hotel in downtown Cuernavaca. Sitting in the garden of the hotel at about 1300 he spotted S(with his shirt off) sitting at another table conversing with a man who looked Russian, apparent age 25, thin, wavy dark brown hair. S's wife also present, but M not. BESABER left after about 15 minutes without talking to S although S must have seen him.

6. Per CO instructions BESABER phoned L on 24 February to apologize for not making it to the reception. During this conversation (LIENVOY intercepted) L said he would come to BESABER's house for lunch on Saturday, 25 February with about five other people. He showed up at about 1545, stayed until 1830 with:

Aleksandr Mikhaylovich BROVKIN (P-829) and wife
Boris Aleksandrovich MALAKHOVICH (P-9772) and wife
Mrs. Pavel YATSKOV (P-885)
Mrs. LOGINOV (P-11712).
8 assorted children of above.

7. They arrived in two cars, BROVKIN driving a 2-year old light blue Ford Falcon, LOGINOV a blue-gray Chevrolet, license plates 19-DA. (BEBABER may be color blind - our records show both cars as being green.)

8. The conversation was characterized by a lot of propaganda on BROVKIN's and LOGINOV's part. Although Vietnam was not mentioned, L boasted several times that the Soviets would get to the moon first, complained about the Kennedy murder scandal, and generally spoke in an anti-American vein. BESABER and his wife tried to laugh them out of this theme, but with little success.

9. At one point BESABER mentioned an article he had recently read in Business Week about the Soviet car industry. When he told LOGINOV that the article purported to be based on CIA information, L would not leave him alone until he found the article and gave it to him.

10. LOGINOV was obviously the superior of the three men. Neither MALAKHOVICH nor his wife said a word. BROVKIN, after a few drinks (but not drunk) started moaning about the problems of life, mentioned that the only thing that kept him going was his good wife and children. At this point LOGINOV walked up behind BROVKIN' chair, practically lifted BROVKIN, chair and all, and said, "We must go."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 64

11. As far as the BESABERS could make out the only purpose of the visit (other than to get a free meal) was to invite the BESABERS to come to the Embassy to see Soviet films. Not knowing how he should react BESABER was non-committal, although he couldn't resist asking BROVKIN if they had any Westerns in color. (I told BESABER he should not go to movies and if the subject came up again to tell the Sovs that while he liked them as people, he didn't want to hear their propaganda either orally or from the sound track of some lousy movie).

12. BESABER is less impressed by LOGINOV's intelligence than heretofore. Between L's and B's heavy-handed propagandizing (especially in the capitalistic "ambiente" of the BESABERS) BESABER was less than impressed with their tact.

13. Mrs. BESARER reported that of the three women Mrs. YATSKOV was by the far the most presentable. She learned that the YATSKOVS were on their second tour in Mexico, that they liked Mexico (Mrs. BESABER is Mexican). Mrs. BROVKIN related that they had one daughter (age 14) in Moscow besides the two children with them in Mexico.

14. Plans for future get-togethers include only LOGINOV. Mrs. BESABER will look for some housing for the Sovs in Cuernavaca; when she has found something, they'll invite LOGINOV down to have a look at them. There is also the possibility of tennis, although both BESABERS are loathe to tako any Sovs to Mrs. BESABER's tennis club, practically all the members of which are Americans. I agree.

15. The BESABERS proposed and I second the motion that I contact Laurence Higgins, a long-time Station contact and personal friendof the BESABERS and tell them that the BESABERS are cultivating Sovs in our behalf, ask him to let BESABERS bring LOGINOV, and possibly others to Higgin's court in Cuernavaca.

16. Attached are signatures of the Sovs who visited BESARER.

17. Raul Morales Montoya - At 23 Feb meet BESABER handed over the attached postcard from RMM, dated 14 Feb from Colima. At the 28 Feb meet BESABER reported that had phoned him from Colima on 24 Fed, reporting among other things that he would be in Colima for another month or so. He said he was working in the office of Secretaria Particular of the Governor of Colima (tel: 2-04-11) and staying at the Motel Costeno (tel: 2-00-35).

On Saturday 28 I went to a party at the house of the Greek
Consul General Leander Vourvoulias, and I saw there Vladimir
Loguinov engaged in a heated discussion with an american
consul whose name is Sherry. Sherry was arguing that there were
A lot of Chinean in North Viet Nam, and Loguinov was saying
that it was a pity that such a big nation as the US should be
fighting an small and poor nation like Viet Nam.

I had a talk with Loguinov, who I think now is in charge
of consular affairs and he told me that he thought that nego-
ciations for the cultural agreement with Mexico were still
going on, but that those who had been awarded the fellowships boys
had already gone. But according to what he said there were
quite a few more than ten.

Loguinov was with his wife and talking about the Bolshoi
ballet he told me that I should have rang him up and he would
have taken us, me and my wife, to see the ballet and to see
the dancers behind the stage. He said that the ballet was
coming to Canada for the fair and probably would come again to
México.

The Russians will give a party for the consule, film, and
drinks, sometime during February..

Loguinov asked me if I thought that some consuls would not
show up at the Russian embassy as they did when they were invi-
ted by the Cubans. I told him that the position was entirely
different because most countries had diplomatic and consular
relations with the URRS.

LIROBBIN-2 Contact Report, 28 Feb 1967 Orig filed: P-11665

recently rejoined RAY'S firm after previously leaving it and working for another firm in Mexico City. (The man is undoubtedly John G.PAGE, who is listed in the 1966-67 Anglo-American Directory as Sales Manager for Tele-Revista, S.A. The 1961-62 Anglo lists a John G. PAGE as being with Richard K. TONFKINS y Assoc.--i.e., clearly the predecessor of "TONFEINS, RAY, HARTEL.") According to Subject, Hrs. .FAGE's mother is Dr. Anita BRENNER, an American and the editor of "Mexico This Month." Mr. FAGE looks to be 35-40 years old and his wife about 30. FAGE is half Jewish and one of his parents was born in Russia. PAGE consequently speaks some Russian and spoke a little with KUCHTROV. LIROBBIN-1 saw RAY a few days after the film showing, and RAY mentioned that PAGE had told him that. KUCHEROV had made a definite effort to make friends with him (PAGE), but that he (PAGE) had no interest in making friends with Communists.

4. As it turned out, Gulliver's Travels wasn't shown after all, as the film turned out to be in very poor condition and kept breaking when run on the projector. In its place, the Soviets showed a Soviet film about a poor young woman in 19th or early 20th century Russia who marries a wealthy old man and is corrupted by her new found riches. The kids and everyone else were disappointed, but Subject found some consolation in the fact that the flick at least was clean.

5. 15 February. On this date Subject and LIROBBIN-1 attended an evening reception at the Indian Erbassy at the invitation of the'r friend K.D. FARASHAR, the Indian Consul. LOGINOV and SOKOLOV were also there, both without wives. Subfeet at first

and unfortunately really didn't know of any. LOGINOV said that he probably really ought to take English lessons from a Britisher. He added that he had once taken a few lessons from a "girl from Texas," but he had had to stop because of her "Texas accent." LOGINOV finally said that well, look, he was having "a little party" the next evening and would like Subject and her husband (whom he eventually met in the course of the evening) to attend, as he would like to have her become acquainted with the Soviet Embassy, too (i.e., in addition to the Indian Embassy). LOGINOV added that perhaps she could even put something in THE NEWS about the affair. Subject accepted the invitation, although without LIROBBIN-1, who was about to leave for the States, and said she'd see if she could get a photographer to the Embassy.

6. 16 February. On this date Subject attended the Consular Corps gathering at the Soviet Embassy. She went with the PARASHARS. LOGINOV was the first Soviet to greet her, but within a few moments PRIKHODKO and KUCHEROV came hustling up. Subject said that LOGINOV seemed genuinely surprised that his colleagues already knew her, but he did not ask for an explanation of how. On their parts, PRIKHODKO and KUCHEROV seemed equally surprised, but also avoided asking any questions. In the course of the evening, Subject talked with PRIKHODKO, KUCHEROV, DOLGOV, Mrs. PRIKHODKO, and Mrs. SOKOLOV. LOGINOV made no effort to search her out, and she did not talk with him again until leaving, at which time she thanked him for the invitation and apologized that the NEWS photographer she had asked to come to the Embassy had not shown up. However, she said she'd try to put something in "Around the Town."

she gone and spend and/or make some time with her. She said she actually felt sorry for KUCHTROV, because he just wasn't cut out for the role and she thought he probably dreaded it.

8. **23 February.** On this date Subject attended the Soviet Army Day reception at the Soviet Embassy. She went with Pearl GONZALEZ and an American named Bill SOLEINE, whom Pearl brought along as her escort. (KUCH! ROV left an Invitation for Pearl with Subject on 17 February.) According to Subject, SOLEMINE is about 35 and is in "publicity" work here. (According to the A-A Directory, William A. *SOLEINE is an executive in the International Department of Walter Thompson de Mexico.) Subject did not notice any other Americans at the reception.

She talked with PRIKHODKO, Mrs. PRICHODKO, KUCIFROV, DOLGOV, and, briefly, LOGINOV. DOLGOV said he had been with PRAVDA for six years. Subject had put a blurb about the 16 February Consular function in THE NEWS on 19 February and brough along a clipping for LOGINOV. LOGINOV said he hadn't seen it, seemed pleased, and thanked her. He then asked if she were going on the Consular Corps tour of the Mexican Home Show on 3 March. Well, no, Subject replied, why would she be, she wasn't a consul or married to one, and consequently hadn't been invited. LOGINOV replied that he thought she should go and therefore he was making her an honorary Soviet consul. Subject said that was fine with her and she'd see him at the Home Show. (I told Subject on 28 February to be careful with LOGINOV, because he was an experienced KGB officer and one of the most able men in the Soviet Embassy. This seemed to delight as much as concern Subject.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

9. 3 March. Subject did not at first see LOGINOV on the Home Show tour, but mid-way through the tour she felt a tap on her shoulder, turned and saw LOGINOV. They then walked along together for the last 25 minutes of or so of the tour. Subject said that nothing of interest was said and they parted without any specific mention of getting together again. Subject said LOGINOV spent most of the time criticizing the U.S. on everything from its foreign policy to its treatment of the American Indian.

10. Pearl GONZALEZ. Subject told me on 8 March that Pearl had just received permission from the Cuban Government to visit Cuba as a journalist. Subject said U.S. foreign correspondents in Mexico had applied for permission to visit Cuba many times in the past, but had all been turned down. Pearl and Harold JON'S of the Copley News Service, according to Subject, were the two most recent American applicants. JONES, according to Subject, was turned down. Subject said she thought Pearl was probably given permission because the Cubans believe they can lead her a round by the hand and get some useful publicity out of her. Subject noted that Pearl believes Castro has done a lot of good for Cuba and that he has been unfairly treated by the U.S. press. Moreover, Subject observed, Pearl is by no means a full-fledged or experienced newspaper woman, as her only experience consists of writing society articles in THE NEWS for the last year. Subject said Pearl planned to visit the American Embassy on 8 March in order to get permission from the State Department to make the trip.

11. Antonio HALIK. I asked Subject if she knew HALIK, who according to the Foreign Correspondents' Assoc. handbook, is a

SUBJECT: LICOZY-5

DATE OF MEETING: 22 February 1967.

1. I had breakfast with Subject at the Hotel Del Paseo from 0900 to 1000 on 22 February 1967. Next meeting is at the same place at 0900 on 8 March 1967.

2. Subject reported that he had had lunch with LOGINOV as planned. LOGINOV brought up the following topics:

a. LOGINOV brought up the Ramparts-article about CIA. Subject hadn't read or heard of.it. LOGINOV then said this proved that CIA was very active and said they were active in Mexico. He again asked Subject if he had any friends at the American Embassy. Subject for the nth time told LOGINOV that he hadn't been in the American Embassy and that an office boy takes care of visas, etc. at the Embassyу.

b. LOGINOV then said that he was going to explain to Subject the line of the CC of the CPUSSR on China. Then followed an harangue against the Chinese which Subject stated contained nothing that hasn't been in the newspapers.

c. LOGINOV said that he has a Mexican girl whom he didn't identify and asked if Subject would give her a job or find her a job. Subject asked about her qualifications, English, typing, etc, LOGINOV answered that he didn't know. Subject said to send her around and he would see. To date she has not appeared. (COMMENT: Subject said he has no intention of hiring her, if she comes, but thought we would be interested in her identify. I told him to find out as much about her as possible. However since LOGINOV didn't say what kind of a job she wanted or what she could do, I will be surprised if she comes.)

d. LOGINOV went into some detail explaining to Subject about the party he was giving at the Soviet Embassy on 16 February. for the Consular Corps. He then invited Subject.

0. LOGINOV said that Aeroflot service would be inaugurated between New York and Moscow in May. Once it is instituted local Soviets will fly to New York and catch Aeroflot there. Subject asked about U.S. visas which the Soviets have always complained about in the past. LOGINOV said that the Soviets will be travelling from Mexico to New York on Air France and Air France has agreed to handle the matter of transit visas with the U.S. Embassy. LOGINOV added that the local Soviets are looking forward to the stop off in New York which is much more interesting than Montreal. (COMMENT: If this works out we will have good advance notice of Soviet travel from Mexico and excellent passport photos).

3. Subject wont to the party on 16 February 1967 with his secretary and his friend, Sinai Rome, First Secretary and Consul at the Israeli Embassy. He saw PRIKHODKO briefly and PRIKHODKO's wife attached herself to him and took care of him for the evening. He noted that YATSKOV wasn't at the party.

4. Rome introduced Subject to Jan JAKOWIEC. The minute JAKOWIEC heard Subject's name, he asked if he were from Mundus Tours. They then conversed in Polish. JAKOWIEC told Subject that the Polish delegation to the Olympics will come on the Batory and that the Poles are building a ship twice the size of the Batory which will be put on the Poland-New York City run next year. JAKOWIEC suggested that they get together for lunch and Subject agreed. JAKOWIEC said he would call Subject in about a week. Subject remarked that he is a sharp guy and speaks very good Russian. I told Subject that JAKOWIEC is the UB resident and instructed him not to go beyond a social relationship in any manner. Subject agreed.

5. Subject still has not heard anything on the ZABLUDOWSKIY-ECHEVARRIA dinner.

6. Subject is travelling to Los Angeles on business for two days on 24 February. On 27 April he will go to Israel for 10 days to conduct a group of Mexicans who are going to the opening of the Mexican Pavillion at a university which was paid for by Mexican Jews.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: LICOZY-5

DATE OF MEETING: 15 February 1967.

1. I met and had breakfast with Subject at the Hotel Del Paseo from 0900 to 0950 on 15 February 1967. The next meeting is at the Del Paseo on 22 February at 0830.

2. Subject reported that after a hiatus of no contact with any Soviet since the end of December, LOGINOV called him on 13 February and asked him for lunch on the 14th. Subject was busy on the 14th but agreed to meet him on the 15th at the Cafe Escla, near Subject's place of work. Subject chose a cafe rather than a restaurant in order to keep the meeting brief. He assured me that, other than being pleasant, he wouldn't accept any assignments or requests for information:

3. Subject said that the private dinner for influential Jews to talk to ECHEVARRIA at Jacobo ZABLUDOWSKI's house had not taken place. Subject will check with ZABLUDOWSKI. He said he also intends to make a courtesy call on ECHEVARRIA soon since he is a very influential man, may become President and it wouldn't harm Subject to keep his oar in.

4. Subject heard from Pedro Ferriz, a partner of ZABLUDOWSKI on TV, that USIA in Mexico had payed for the TV transmission time of the recent KOSYGIN interview from London. Asked why, Ferriz answered that USIA wanted the Mexican public to know the Soviet position on Vietnam and China.

5. Subject reported that the Air France inaugural flight to Red China had been cancelled due to the situation in China. I told Subject that Headquarters had expressed no interest in any case.

6. I asked Subject for the details on being representative for LUEXINSHE, the Red Chinese equivalent of Intourist. He said that in 1960 he attended the American Society of Travel Agents convention in Honolulu. On the way back he took a tour of the FE and NE with a group of travel agents. In Hong Kong the Hong Kong Tourist Board had a cocktail party for them. A representative of LUEXINSIHE was at the party and invited the group for lunch. Ar this lunch he offered to make them agents for his company. Everybody signed up since there was no contract involved; they were just appointed. Since then he has been on

their mailing list. He never has processed a traveller to China. He thinks that Cooks is also an agent but is not sure.

7. Subject said he is processing several people as tourists to the USSR in the spring and summer. No visas have been issued yet. He promised me thermofax copies of all visas.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Cocktail Party with Official Bloc Representatives

1. At a party given by the local head of the Consular Corpy Association on 28 June, the undersigned met and again chatted with Valentin S. LOGINOV of the Soviet Embassy. He also met for the first time Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy who was introduced to undersigned by LOGINOV.

2. As usual LOGINOV spent most of the time conversing with undersigned provocating him on a number of issues. The undersigned answered, making a few similar comments about the Chinese Civil War. When LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undersigned felt it would be nice if the Soviets helped the U. S. to bring peace to that area so they could concentrate more-on the Chinese Communist danger. At one point in the conversation undersigned jokingly asked LOGINOV if there were Soviét nationals in North Vietnam. The latter said, "sure, we have many advisors there." The undersidnged said, "no, what he meant was behind guns or in the seats of airplanes." LOGINOV said absolutely not. It also seems that LOGINOV has been keeping track of the people he sees undersigned talking with at cocktail parties. For example, LOGINOV was curious to know if undersigned has seen "his Haitian friends." Undersigned asked which one - the black one or the white one. LOGINOV said the white one, referring to the Haitian Vice Consul whom undersigned occasionally talks to. Undersigned said he had seen the Haitian at the Haitian National Day about a month ago but noted that the only Soviet present at that party was ANDREYEV, not LOGINOV. The latter, incidentally, corners the Haitians anytime he has a chance to, although he officially poo poos the Haitian regime. LOGINOV once more asked under- signed when he would come play tennis with him (this is about the fourth or fifth time). Undersigned told him he would do so after he gets invited by LOGINOV as the latter has often promised to do. One of the topics that LOGINOV mentioned was the Protection Section of the Embassy. "Protection against whom," he asked. The undersigned gave him the usual lowdown: on the number of tourists to Mexico and their problems. LOGINOV must have been interested in the section as he mentioned that a U. S. Vice-Consul working in that section whom he had met recently will be transferring to another post.

3. JAKOWIEC appears to be a man who likes to talk. His Spanish is quasi bi-lingual and JAKOWIEC says, by the way, that he learned it in Brazil. His wife is a plump, very Polish-looking woman. Her initial conversation was to laugh at some of the exchanges between LOGINOV and the undersigned. Both Mr. and Mrs. JAKOWIEC appear to speak fluent Russian. At one point in the conversation undersigned mentioned there is hardly a Pole in Poland who does not have a relative in the United States; JAKOWIEC agreed and commented that while the Poles are close to Americans in many things they are not so pleased at other things that the U. S. does. Undersigned deferred this discussion at this point for another meeting. As many of the Consular Corps members know that undersigned served many years in Vietnam, the latter felt that he should not hide this fact to the official bloc representatives as they would find out about it anyway. This came out for the first time on the occasion of this cocktail party when JAKOWIEC somehow mentioned Vietnam and the efforts of the Polish members of the Armistice Commission there. The undersigned, who has known a number of these people quite well, told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish as they were sons of Polish emigrants to France who returned to Poland after Gomulka took power. When JAKOWIEC started to imply that this indicated how wonderful things were in Poland, undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees, many of whom worked under very difficult conditions in France in the coal mines, preferred the hard work to the chance of working in Communist Poland.

4. The next cocktail party held by the Consular Assn. will probably be held at the Soviet Embassy. The President of the Association told undersigned that LOGINOV had asked him for his agreement to hold the next party at his Embassy. A large attendance of official bloc representatives can therefore be expected at the next get-together.

SUBJECT: Progress Report/LICO-5 (1 November 1966 - 15 January 1967)

REFERENCES: 11420, 1 December 1966

P-2712 January 1967

1. The last Progress Report (see Reference) reported developments in
   Station through 31 October 1966; but not included were Subject's activities at
   Conference in London to which Subject traveled on 22 October 1966. This will be reported later.

2. Contacts

A. Subject and Case Officers

Apart from Subject's frequent visits in Moscow during October 1966 and to former KGB case officer in Mexico, Oleg Nechiporenko, Subject since his return to Mexico from London and Israel trip in mid-November has spent only 9 times on four occasions with a total time of less than an hour.

In Moscow, where Subject was attending the IRIST Conference, Subject was visiting briefly every day in his room at the Hotel National by Nechiporenko, from 24 October through 28 October.

First contact by the Soviets on Subject's return to Mexico was effected by KGB case officer Aleksandr Vladimirovich Irikhodko (201-202379) on 3 December in Subject's office for a few minutes. On 8 December, Valentin Sergeyevich Loginov (201-120231), Subject's regular KGB case officer, called Subject down to the street outside Subject's office to present him with Bolshoi Ballet tickets. On 18 December, Loginov visited Subject's office and spent no more than half an hour there. And on 30 or 31 December, Subject was paid a brief visit by former KGB officer (possible candidate for resident) (201-120123) at Subject's office.

B. Subject and Mexico City Station Case Officer

In the two months since Subject's return from Europe in mid-November, the C/O, in addition to routine, has seen Subject six times for an approximate total of nine hours.

The C/O met Subject at his office on 22 November for two hours.

In December, the C/O met Subject three times, on 8 December at his office for almost two hours, on 13 December at the Hotel Refoma for a half-hour, and on 22 December at Subject's office for an hour.

On 7 January, the C/O and his wife took Subject to dinner at the Belvedere Room of the Hotel Continental Hilton, to repay Subject for a former invitation to Subject's home. On 12 January, the C/O met Subject at the latter's office for one hour.

Valentin (lo (Loginov) in Lexico about it. Also, Nechipererko telt surfcct that they
hadn't forgotten chout the "branch office" and thes Subject shakin't feel bad
about the delay in betting it up. Subject ridiculed that idea, saying that it tha
the Soviets who should feel bad; as for him, he couldn't be bothered in the future
with the tripa and tira involved. Nechiporenko, still not chastened, coked if
Subject would provide information on all changes in visa regulations for trevel in
Central South America. Subject az said he had given this informition to the
Socists in the sl. Nechiporenko then asked subject to continue to gire such
information to Valentin.

Subject clicited from Nechiporenko that he uns forting in the Latin roricon...
Section of the Foreign Linistry, and that he uns allowed to come and go cs he
pleased to visit Subject. In the context of telling subject that he saw that
Subject was not getting along with his Soviet friends, Nechiporenko said that he
would be coming back to Lerico naxt year.

One day while Nechiporanko wus in the hotel room, the phone rang and Sud.ject
picked up the phone. A female voice asked for "Givy." Subject Banteringly replied
in bussian that "Givy" wasn't around, but wouldn't ha do. In the ensuing converse-
tion Subject found out that the caller was a 25 year old stuntant, her address and
teleshone number, and mide a date to meet her the following day at the Lanin Station
e. it of the Petro. Lechiporanko was all in favor of Subject making the date, and
as a matter of fact came the next day to tuke Subject's son to the circus so that
Subject would be free. /Comment: Subject said that he never did go to meet the axit
girl, but told Nechiporenko that he had gone and the girl hed not shoun up. Sudject
w.s of the opinion this was not a provocation by the Soviats, but he shied aray
because he did not want to de involved in anything indiscreet./

Then Aleksandr Irikhodko dropped in unexpectedly at Subject's office on 3
Dacamder, while subject's wife and son were present, the. Soriet asked when he could
have lunch with subject, and the latter put him off telling Frikhodko tó 11 next
week. /Commit: Irikhodko did not call/..

On 3 December, Valentin Loginov, who had called Subject's office bu Bone c
hara :,fect come down to the street, saw Subject for just a minute to sont in
with two tickets to the Bolshoi Ballet for 9 December. /Comment: Subjec atended./


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 92

3. 
On 13 December, Loginov came unannounced to Subject's office and prevailed on him to have coffee with him nearby. The Soviet presented Subject with four bottles of Cuban rum for Christmas, and began to ask Subject a series of personal questions:
Did Subject left Poland for Paris after WWII – had his documentation been legal or illegal? Subject answered that it was legal.
2) How was he able to enter Paris – did he have a valid French visa? Subject said he did. How long did he stay in Paris? Subject said a few months.
Were there any recruiters to his release? Subject said no. Was he supposed to be contacted by the Polish? Subject said yes, and related the story of how he was contacted in Paris (in March 1964) by a Polish diplomatic courier who brought a letter from Subject's old comrade in the UB, and how subject answered that letter. Is Subject's attitude to the Polish team positive or negative? Subject said neutral.
Loginov told him "Subject replied that he believed that eighty percent of the Poles were anti-Soviet. You were right."

Loginov asked how Subject was getting along with the American airlines as he deals with. Subject said la fine, and asked why. Loginov said that maybe, if Subject has patience, he can learn the name of "the director of the CIA in Mexico." Subject told Loginov he is crazy to think Subject could get that information. Loginov insisted in knowing whether Subject would tell the Soviets if he did get that information, and Subject dismissed the topic with a coy "maybe."
Loginov went on to show Loginov the documents that backed up his answers to Loginov's questions.

On either 30 or 31 December, Iosel Yatskov dropped by Subject's office carrying some gifts he had brought back from Moscow. /Comment: Subject had one of his drivers ensure the Yatskov's train to Moscow by arranging for Subject's transportation in Paris to contact Vetokhov./. Yatskov expressed gratefulness to Subject for presenting him with a bottle of Caucasian wine, some vodka, a decorative pencil from an Italian company. Yulakov (who no longer holds the post of Soviet Consul in Buenos Aires, a negligible contact for KGB resident) told Subject that he is also preparing propaganda for "them", and he is sure that Subject will not be alone in the realization of their common ideals. And Yatskov further stated that he and Zabludovsky are very much in common, and that they should meet. It was left to Subject how to contact Zabludovsky.

F. Subject/Mexico City Station

The C/O met at his office on 22 November 1966 to debrief him on the results of his trip to Moscow (see paragraph 3 A. above). In addition to providing information on his contacts with Nechiporenko, Subject gave incidental information concerning a female Soviet Jew he met, and the anti-American attitude of a friend apart from Childa.

On 8 December, in Subject's office, Subject reported to the US contact's wife on contacts he had with Irikhodio and Loginov on 3 and 8 December in response to US contact's wife's request, re-opened with Subject the topic of the community support that Secretary of Gobernación Echeverría is offering him in his candidacy for next president of Mexico. Subject related that Jacobo Zabludovsky had come to mention the matter to Subject, and that Subject was being proposed as one of the five influential members of the Devisa community for Echeverría's approval (Zabludovsky did not mention the fact to Subject).
The CIA requested that Subject check further with Zabludovsky when he has the opportunity.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 93

4. 
Subject returned to the C/O about Leginov's permanent mentions on 19 November of same day (as paragraph A. above). The C/O re if he had intentions of Leginov why the latter was cooking such situations. Subject said that although he was completely puzzled by this tack on the part of the Soviets, that Subject said he felt perfectly at ease in telling the truth to the Soviets, and had no hesitation in showing them his documentation.

The C/O crossed by Subject's office on 22 December, after having delivered a Christmas gift of liquor to Subject's home the previous day. Subject reported 2) on Soviet travel for Georgi Visko, and said he had met Viskov's related Victor M. Ivanov.

2) that he had received a holiday-season letter from the Department official now in Chile. /Comments re: Soviets in Mexico through Subject. Nothing occurred of it.

3) Subject reported that he had received a firm invitation from the Air France to go on the inaugural flight of Air France to Algiers.

Subject reported in November 1967, to which Subject had replied that he "would look into it," and expressed himself as neutral about his going, but offered to assist the C/O if the C/O had any interest in his taking the trip. The C/O replied that this would be examined.

The C/O then discussed seriously with Subject the question of how to handle his break-off from the Soviets really was, inasmuch as there was some scepticism about Subject that the scepticism came from the Soviets and not shared by the C/O. The C/O asked Subject to honor his previous request to report the names of his personal documentation.

Subject readily offered to inform his previous contacts in Mexico: he was convinced that the control would deny the Soviets any access to the Soviets' case (the Station's approval was required); even though he might jokingly still inform his friendly new Soviets with his personality. He explained his willingness to pass his documentation to the Soviets, because he wasn't afraid of them. Subject added that he'd show those "bastards" his documentation to see if he could get the go-ahead on passing the documentation to the Soviets concerning it.

On 15 January 1967, the C/O (having received the Station's expression of interest in having Subject follow up the invitation from Air France) asked Subject for more details concerning the invitation from Air France, and gave him his approval to pursue the matter.

4. The current C/O, Frantice R. Varheine, will turn Subject over to Frank Coigne before Subject's departure from Mexico the end of January 1967.

Languages: LOGINOVA has been studying Spanish with Carmen ROURE Canosa, a local employee of the Soviets, since at least June 1966 through May 1967 (1), but her Spanish is still said to be very limited (6,25). She is said to speak a little English (25), and claimed she had studied English in Moscow (1). She is also said to speak some French (25).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 96

(wife, cont.)

Miscellaneous: LOGINOVA has sald that she has known her husband since age six as neighbors in Moscow (6). She claims to be a chemical engineer (6). During Subject's tour in Havana, 1960-63, LOGINOVA worked In the Soviet Consulate (28). She arrived in Mexico on 10 Oct 1965, two months after her husband (4). Since Feb 1966 she had been reported as chairman of the *zhenkom* (Soviet women's organization), and as such has had to persuade the Soviet women to do various administrative chores, as well as being involved with running the *dacha* that the Soviets have had in Cuernavaca in the summers of 1966 and 1967 (1).

Daughter: Irina, born ca. 1952 (28).

Dmitrly was with his parents in Havana, 1960-63 (28), and arrived in Mexico City with his mother on 10 Oct 1965 (4).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 97

8. LANGUAGES:

Spanish: Subject speaks fluent Spanish with very little accent (11, 24).

In April 1967 he said that he had been paying a girl (American) for lessons in English, but that she did not have enough background in grammar (25). (Comment: Subject was probably more Interested in meeting American girls than in studying English in this case.) Subject's English is believed to be fair at present.

9. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND PHOTOS:

One source described Subject as tall, blond and blue-eyed (11). Another source said that he was six feet tall and had short, reddish-blond hair (24).

Photographs are attached.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

# 10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, HABITS:

All sources agree in describing Subject as smooth and completely elf-controlled. He is an aggressive conversationalist. One source described him as vulgar, crude, ill-mannered, short-tempered and a tyrant, who thinks he is a big shot (8).

Subject seems to have made a play for every girl he has met. In at least one Instance he has claimed to be unmarried when inviting a girl out (27). When his wife was staying at the dacha in Cuernavaca he reportedly made dates with other women (8). On 13 Sep 1966 he was seen in a cafe with a Mexican-looking woman (18).

Subject is interested-in sports and is good at them. In Sep 1966 It was reported that he did not play tennis (15), and by Apr 1967 he was sald to be a good tennis player, claimed that he had been playing for less than a year and never played more than once a week (25). He is sald to have the build of a trained athlete, the brutish look of a boxer or wrestler, and the grace of a natural athlete (25). He has said that he boxed when he was younger, and that he plays basketball and volleyball (25), also that his favorite sports are skiing and speed skating (21). He also plays chess but is not an addict (25). He has belonged to the French Club in Mexico City since ca. November 1965 (1) and has been seen there frequently on weekends, sometimes with his wife and child (15). One Sunday (20 Mar 1966) Subject and Yevgeniy Nikolayevich GORLITSYN were seen playing badminton with their wives at the French Club (15).

One source reported that Subject smoked "Fiesta" cigarettes (8), and another source reported in Apr 1967 that Subject did not smoke (25). One source has reported that Subject downs several beers after playing tennis (25), but another source reported that on a social occasion Subject did not even finish one Scotch and water (19). On Subject and Vladislav Sergeyevich KOR MUSHKIN reported drove Into the Soviet Embassy at 0300 hours roaring drunk (8), which may or may not be accurate reporting.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 99

Subject has apparently been taking English lessons since early 1966 at the inr Instituto de Interpretes y Traductores, which is located at Tiber 113 very near the U.S. Embassy. He seems to have made friends with a number of people through these classes. (1). (Cf. under Contacts.)

In February 1966 It was reported that Subject's wife had bought a tape recorder (1). In June 1967 Subject himself as ordered a Grundig tape recorder (1).

Subject was reported having an operation on 1 Feb 1966 (17); no further detalls are available.

11. CURRICULUM VITAE:

Subject claims that he has served in the Red Army (8).

(Subject's name was reportedly listed in Feb 1960 as about to be assigned to Buenos Aires as Sovlet Military Attache; it would appear that either this was another person with the same name, or that Subject was being considered for assignment there as diplomatic attache.)

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES:

(Cf. also information under Contacts, below, Subject has undoubtedly been developing contacts, particularly with American girls, with a view toward Intelligence possibilities.)

In December 1961 while travelling with the Dynamo soccer team, Subject met a Bolivian security/official in La Paz, Bolivia and reportedly tried to persuade him to study in Cuba. The source, however, is believed to be a fabricator. (28).

After Subject saw the soccer team off, he continued to Panama, where he met with a Mexican citizen, Edmundo Fausto ZORRILLA Martinez (P-2818) on 16 Dec 1961, and On 17 Dec 1961 Subject and ZORRILLA travelled to Mexico City on the same plane. Subject had ca. (US) $ 2,000 with him in Panama. (29).

On 14 Feb 1966 KGB officer Aleksandr Vladimirovich PRIKHODKO (201-202379) turned an agent over to Subject. (The agent had previously been handled by Subject's predecessor, Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO.).

On 14 Apr 1966 the agent attempted to break his intelligence relationship with the Soviets, although he has remained in business and social contact with them, Subject, occasionally joined by PRIKHODKO, has continued to give intelligence requirements to the agent, and questioned him particularly about his access to the U.S. Embassy and tried to persuade him to continue cooperating with the KGB. On 24 Jun 1966 Subject asked the agent for Information on Eduardo WEBELMAN and his son Mauricio. On 13 Dec 1966 Subject asked the agent to try to find out who the WOFACT chief in Mexico was. (6). (Comment:

O Personality Assessment Questionnaire on Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412)

1.  Forwarded herewith is a Personality Assessment Questionnaire on LOGINOV prepared by LIREALM-1 in February 1969.

2.  By virtue of membership in the same club in which they are both active participants in the same activity, LIREALM-1 has known LOGINOV for a little over two years. In this club they have several mutual contacts. As a result LIREALM-1 has met LOGINOV several times at social activities in the homes of these contacts. Although LOGINOV has never been a formal target for LIREALM-1, the relationship has been close enough and of sufficient duration for LIREALM-1 to fill out a meaningful Personality Assessment Questionnaire.

# PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1.  This is a new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ III) which has been in use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.

2.  For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been developing a system for indirect assessment of target personalities. The system employs in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such observations are used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The goal of the assessment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.

3.  Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact, it is a rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking. Mark such items with a "G," instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, an observer with very limited contact can be expected to enter more "G's" than "X's."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

4. Before completing the enclosed PAQ form, please provide the following information about yourself:

Age 39 Sex M Nationality US

Social-cultural background:

What is the nature of your contact? (direct acquaintance, embassy receptions/parties, informants, debriefing of others, etc.)

5. Can you supply a specimen of the target individual's handwriting?
   Yes No X

9.02.19 Is there anything about his eating habits or manners that requires

______

9.03 Overall impression of eating and smoking behavior. (Check the
most appropriate description.)

9.03.01 A hearty eater with well-defined preferences. He eats and smokes
with considerable gusto but tends to be a little on the coarse and
boorish side. It is rather easy to imagine him eating huge sand-
wiches and drinking beer with the boys at the neighborhood bar. ______

9.03.02 A heavy eater with limited preferences. He eats and smokes
with gusto but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish.
It is rather easy to imagine him becoming quite sharp with a
waiter who serves him unfamiliar food or a dish prepared in
an unfamiliar way. ______

9.03.03 A sensual eater who knows all the restaurants and their native
specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he
has discovered. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors his
smokes, and though rarely gauche, he is more aware of his
food than his manners. It is easy to imagine him cooking and
serving special dishes to his friends. ______


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 160

9.03.04 A sensual eater who tends to eat by himself when possible. He seems to eat all types of food and has something of the air of a glutton about him. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors his smokes and afterwards will linger alone at a table with self-satisfaction. It is easy to imagine him hovering alone over the buffet at a cocktail party savoring the tidbits.

9.03.05 A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd. He probably has food allergies that prevent him from eating certain foods. He gives the impression, of enjoying smoking more than eating but his table manners are adapted to whatever situation he is in. It is easy to imagine him taking an indigestion pi'l in the privacy of his room.

9.03.06 A conventional eater who always goes along with the crowd. He eats with little relish and rarely mentions anything about his likes or dislikes. He smokes at every opportunity, but more mechanically than with pleasure. He usually tries to adapt his manners to the situation but may be a little awkward and obvious in doing so. It is easy to imagine him grabbing a bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.

9.03.07 A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated food tastes. Dining is quite a ritual with him, and atmosphere and service are almost as important as the food. He is graceful and cultured at table and smokes in the same manner. It is easy to imagine him dressing for dinner, enjoying fine wines and food by candlelight.

9.03.08 An unconventional eater, a man who "eats like a bird." He eats in a preoccupied way, obviously indifferent to his food and surroundings. It would not be surprising to learn he was a food faddist (vegetarian, health foods, etc.).

9.03.09 None of these descriptions really fit. I would describe him as:

Does not look hung over in spite of what he says

9.04.20 Is there anything special about his drinking habits that requires mention? If so, please describe:

9.05 Overall impression of drinking behavior: (Check the most appropriate)

9.05.01 A hearty, heavy drinker who holds his liquor well. He is always rather boisterous, and when he drinks, there is little change in behavior.

9.05.02 A heavy drinker who often gives the impression he can drink others under the table: When he drinks, there is little change in behavior, but there is a hint that he could get quite mean if provoked.

9.05.03 A steady drinker who obviously enjoys being "tight." In a way he can be somewhat charming when drunk and can get away with a bit of the "life of the party" routine.

9.05.04 A steady drinker who becomes somewhat more maudlin when drunk or tight. Tends to tell people how much he likes them and sometimes asks others whether they like him. Gives an impression that he could become quite disgusting if he got very drunk.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 164

9.05.05 A steady drinker who holds his liquor very well. He al-
ways remains quite dignified and usually maintains his poise:
even though others are becoming quite drunk or tight. He
still remains part of the crowd, however that is, he gives:
few signs of being disgusted or bored.

9.05.06 A light drinker who paces his drinks. He seems to drink only
because it is socially necessary. As a party progresses he
tends to become aloof and distant. Is likely to continue to
talk about his work even when it is inappropriate.

9.05.07 A light drinker who tapers off as the evening progresses.
Usually manages to keep a sophisticated aloofness from
others. Often singles out and associates with someone
rather like himself. As the party progresses, he shows
obvious distaste for anything he considers crude or bois-
terous. Often becomes quite sarcastic about others'
behavior.

9.05.08 A very light drinker who either drinks only because he
has to or refuses to drink at all. Is usually not really
a part of the party and is obviously annoyed when others
bring him in against his wishes. Tends to be solitary
and sometimes will leave unobtrusively when the oppor-
tunity presents.

pears to have sound knowledge of automobiles, and drives in c
relaxed efficient manner.

toward others. His stride is fast and intent. He appears to
have a practical mind, is quite possessive and protective and

things" in a matter-of-fact way, appears to have good know
ledge of automobiles, and drives in a determined (sometimes
even hostile) but efficient manner.

appears most of the time to be in good humor. Seldom tries

mobiles but drives in a relaxed, efficient manner.

1.  10.03.04-

practical, he seldom will do anything by "feel." He must
read up and prepare himself when required to "fix things."

automobiles but drives in a somewhat mechanical or highly
controlled manner.

10.03.06 A well-controlled individual who is often somewhat preoccu-
pied even in his walk. When he takes time to "fix things" he

read about automobiles and cares for his car or sees that it is
cared for meticulously. However, when involved in conver-

10.03.07. A well-controlled individual who has a glide (or grace) in his walk. He has little or no interest in "fixing things" but usually knows the best places to get things done and is inclined to be quite particular in how things are done for him. He appears to have relatively little knowledge of the mechanics of an automobile, but appreciates and takes good care of a good automobile. He drives with confidence, but usually at a fast pace with not too much awareness of others.

10.03.08 A rather nervous and temperamental person who walks rapidly and rather awkwardly. He has little or no interest in "fixing things" and is inclined to ignore or throw away things that do not work.

Has a quick temper but holds it well
Has a normal temper X
Has an even temper and is rarely ruffled
Has an unusual amount of tolerance and
would almost never lose his temper

11.01.05 Have you ever seen him lose his temper?
If Yes, give a short description of the incident, including how he reacted.

No
Yes


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

## 11.02 Humor:

### 11.02.01 Is he a person whom you.

Cannot imagine ever teasing anyone
Consider his tendency to tease like that of most people X

### 11.02.06 Is he more inclined to tell a story

Only when encouraged

## 11.03 Overall impression of temperament and sense of humor:
(Check the most appropriate description.)

### 11.03.01 He is a hearty, hale fellow who laughs with gusto arid pleasure. His humor is forthright, not subtle, and although he is sometimes loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the time, his good humor is contagious.

### 11.03.02 He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with considerable gusto. However, he is frequently dour and sometimes intolerant and somewhat humorless. His humor is direct, even crude, and at times, inappropriate. He tends to be the kind of person who laughs more at people than with people. X


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

11.03.03. He is a good-humored fellow who sometimes can be considered jolly and carefree. His humor is clever and well timed. He is quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often can do a good job appropriately livening up a party. Although something of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.

11.03.04 He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person who, at times, can be surprisingly gay and carefree. However, when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and causes some strain for those around him. His humor is often clever but he can be quite sarcastic and even biting on occasion.

11.03.05 He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appropriate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless person, but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes difficult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.

11.03.06 He is a dour and humorless person, always serious and intense. It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not responsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.

11.03.07 He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow with a subtle wit. He can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting. However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his sense of humor and he can be quite condescending towards people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor.

11.03.08 He is an arty, somewhat cynical person who can be quite flippant at times. His humor tends to be a bit far out. He seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates. It is sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing or subtly hostile.

11.03.09 None of these fit. I would describe him as:

12.01.11 Have you ever heard him described in any way by a woman? Yes X
If Yes, what did she say?
No

athletic, virile, manly.

12.02 Overall impression: Which of the following best describes him?

12.02.01 He is an earthy, lusty man who shows little embarrassment about
sex. He treats women appropriately, but makes little effort to
conceal his admiration and attraction. He appears virile and
self-confident with women, and most women seem to like it. X

12.02.02 He is an earthy, lusty man who on occasion can be crude or
even vulgar. He treats women rather harshly, und can become
quite pushy when attracted to a woman. He seems to be very
proud of his virility,. Many women would be offended or re-
buffed by his aggressiveness, but this does not seem to bother
him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 179

12.02.03 He is a somewhat sensual, rather soft man who is very considerate of women. He is prone to hold a woman's hand overly long when talking to her and frequently puts his arms around women he admires. He often uses flattery and-compliments but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his attentiveness..

12.02.04 He is a sensual person, but is embarrassed and insecure about it. He is a rather soft man who tries hard to be inoffensive. However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his eyes when he thinks no one is looking. He is also prone to brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets a chance.

12.02.05 He is a self-confident, rather polished person who is proper and conventional with either men or women. He is always considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be. In a group, he always behaves according to protocol and usually can be quite efficient in doing so.

12.02.06 He is a self-confident and precise person who has something of the air of a professional man about him. He is polite, almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to light a woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in his relations with women. Sometimes his formality is out of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners or procedures to fit the situation.

12.02.07 He is a charming, urbane person and both friendly and sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness. He is neat, even dapper, and can be quite fastidious."
Most of his relations with women appear to be quite platonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several very close friends who are women.

12.02.08 He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom some people consider odd or unusual. He shows little or no interest in women in public. In general, he is a preoccupied.person who only seeks out people with similar interests. There is an ascetic, asexual air about him most of the time.

12.02.09 None of these fit. I would describe him as:

1. On 29 January 1969, Samuel J. KARTASUK met with Subject to deliver the recruitment pitch as advised by Refs. Subject initially refused to cooperate on the grounds that he does not want to get involved in this type of business and that he had given the same answer to "the other side." He readily admitted that he has been under intensive development by Valentin LOGINOV (201-285412) to spot Mexican students who eventually may go to WOLADY; he denied, however, that he has ever accepted the money LOGINOV continually offers him. Subject volunteered that Yuriy CHERNYSH (201-825743) is currently developing one of Subject's students (which we knew), and that Subject would like to foil CHERNYSH's attempt.

2. In spite of Subject's expressions of reluctance to be recruit he answered a number of questions put to him by KARTASUK and he agreed to a follow-up meeting on 7 February. At that meeting, he submitted to more intensive questioning about his background, family, and his association with the FJSTEAL community. There were no sttempts at evasion and many of his answers were corroborated by information that was already known from other sources. Subject agreed to continue meeting clandestinely with KARTASUK and to provide additional information on his contacts with LOGINOV and other members of the KGB.

3. Subject's activities immediately following the pitch were monitored closely by LIEMBRACE and by LIFEAT for the week between the two meetings. The second meeting was counter-surveilled with negative results. Although the recruitment is still tenuous, we believe that it can be firmly cemented and that Subject is committed whether or not he is ready to admit it to himself at this point.

He was introduced to me by Boris Kazantsev who invited me for lunch for the ocasion. Then we go to the Soviet embassy both he and Tchnykhov are always very attentive.

I know several other people from the Soviet embassy but really I could not place them together with their names.

## Summary

1. As reported by Ref A, Samuel J. KARTASUK succeeded in meeting with Subject in Acapulco and in spending nearly a full week with him for the purpose of establishing rapport and assessing him for possible recruitment per Ref B. Assessment by both KARTASUK and LIOVAL-1 indicates that Subject is essentially apolitical with attitudes as pro-Vest as pro-Soviet. KARTASUK believes, however, that he could be recruited to work against FJ8TKAL intelligence if he were made to believe that he is not working against the FJSTEAL people.

2. Recent LIFEAT reveals that Subject is having marital problems and that he consented to see a psychiatrist after his wife made good her threats to leave. According to Subject, he was diagnosed as "paychopathic" with problems stemning from his mother's possessive attitude. The character assessment by KARTASUK agrees with that of LIOVAL-1 but neither has called Subject "psychopathic."

3. While we recognize possible problems, we feel that a recruitment attempt should be made by KARTASUK. Following the recruitment we plan to have KARTASUK sever further relationship with Subject and to handle the case from inside where it can be monitored more closely.

DISPATCH SYMBOL AND NUMBER

HΜΜΑ-36060:

## Meeting

4. As reported previously, KARTASUK went to Acapulco in early November and succeeded in meeting Subject, whose plans for a vacation there with his family were confirmed by LIFEAT. The "chance meeting" came about naturally in the hotel lobby when Subject's precocious four year old daughter approached KARTASUK on the morning of 5 November.

5. KARTASUK used an alias and played the role of a successful public relations man from WOLADY who was recently widowed. He had come to Mexico as a long-term tourist to help piece together his shattered world. There was instant rapport between KARTASUK and both Subject and his wife which permitted him to spend almost the entire week alone with them. As a result, KARTASUK got to know them intimately and to probe naturally into Subject's character, politics, and family rolationship.

## Assessment

6. To both KARTASUK and LIOVAL-1, Subject appears to be essentially spolitical or, at least, politically naive. He expresses simultaneously admiration for both FJSTEAL, where he lived for 17 years, and for WOLADY, where he would like to live. He believes that the political system in each is right for each and that noither system would work for the other. He feels that both the FJSTEAL and BOLADY citizens want peace and are basically good but that both are victims of their political systems. Although Subject wanted at one time to return to FJSTEAL, he knows that he has a better life in Mexico.

7. Subject is an easy-going, extremely pleasant extrovert with a wide circle of friends whom he seen frequently. He has few scruples in regard to marital fidelity and, while his wife isnot happy with his affairs, they have apparently arrived at some sort of working agreement on the subject.

8. Subject has told both KARTASUK and LIOVAL-l that he earns about $4000 (MH) per month and is, therefore, forced to live on a modest scale. While he would like to live better, he is not ambitious and does not let work interfere with pleasure. LIOVAL-l feels that Subject would find easy money a great temptation, that Subject could be influenced fairly easily, and that principles would not stand in his way.

9. With KARTASUK, Subject spoke of his mother on several occasions. He accuses her of possessiveness and claims that it is for this reason that he rebels against anyone's possessing him, including his wife. This problem is apparently genuiné as confirmed by LIFEAT in recent take. Subject consented to psychiatric treatment when his wife made good her threat to leave him (though she returned after several days). Per LIFEAT, Subject said that he has been diagnosed as psychopathic and that the psychiatrist lays the blame at his mother's feet.

## Conclusions

10. LIOVAL-1 has assessed Subject since early March 1968 and KARTASUK assessed him during a week of uninterrupted close association. Both assessments are virtually identical in all major respects. There is little doubt that Subject does, indeed, have some personality adjustment problems and that, if he is recruited, he will require fira handling. Neither KARTASUK nor LIOVAL-1, however, describes Subject as "psychopathic."

11. KARTASUK believes there is a reasonably good possibility that Subject would consent to recruitment, if the approach vore made in such a way as to make him believe that he is working against FJSTEAL intelligence meddling and not against the PJSTEAL people and system. Additionally, we believe it may be possible to introduce stability into Subject's life, to give him fira direction and goals, and to turn some of his liabilities into assets.

12. Following successful recruitment by KARTASUK, the case will be handled by an inside case officer so that developments can be monitored more closely through other assets and the risk reduced.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES:

1. Transmitted herewith is a report prepared by Keith R. LEVENDERIS which details how LOGINOV used Erast. G. GAZIYEV (201-795374) to spot and set up a meeting for assessment purposes with Jorge ARIAS Buerba, a teacher at the Mexican North American Cultural Institute in Mexico City. The Soviets have long had an interest in the Institute and its personnel because most of newly arrived Americans study Spanish there. GAZIYEV has attended the Institute since his arrival in Mexico, first studying Spanish and then English.

2. We are forwarding this report because it is a typical illustration of LOGINOV's modus operandi and because it clearly shows that GAZIYEV at least has the status of a KGB cooptee.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Jorge ARIAS Buerba

1.  Subject is a 26 year old Mexican citizen (although he looks to be in his 30's). He is a Spanish teacher at the Mexican-North American Institute and since the fall of 1967 has held a second job as the director of the Community Services Program at the American School. In April 1967 he married an American citizen from the Chicago area named Donna WEINTHALLER (phonetic). They live at Juanacatlan 15, which is just around the corner from the Soviet Embassy. Home phone is 15-28-49.

2.  Subject was recommended as a Spanish tutor in August 1966 by Enrique GUTIERREZ Martinez (P-12667), who was then C/SB's Spanish tutor. GUTIERREZ was subsequently recruited by C/SB as a utility agent but has since been dropped because he is related to other Station assets. On GUTIERREZ's recommendation, I began taking private Spanish lessons from Subject in August 1966. I found Subject an excellent teacher and continued taking lessons from him until December 1966. In March 1967, my wife and I had Subject as a teacher in Spanish courses we took at the Mexican-North American Institute. I have maintained intermittent social contact with Subject since March 1967, and my wife has become friendly with Subject's wife, having visited her at her apartment two or three times and having had her to our home during the day an equal number of times. I have also

Files: PII/2671


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

kept informed to some extent about Subject through his younger brother, Javier ARIAS Buerba, from whom I have been taking Spanish lessons since July 1967.

3. Subject was a casual contact of Station officer Olivia C. RAGNITY in 1965 and 1966. Other than a file card noting this contact, no Station traces on either Jorge or Javier ARIAS Buerga.

4. Subject and I from the beginning have had a very friendly and informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with a friendly, open personality and a good sense of humor. Politically, he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths and positive qualities and tends to minimize or overlook negative factors in our society. Subject knows I am with the Political Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Union. We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and Communism several times, and he has always come out a strong anti-Communist. He has one brother and two sisters living in the United States. The brother is married to an American and lives in Virginia, where he is in the construction business. One of the sisters is also married to an American and lives in California (I believe San Francisco). The second sister is married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago. The sister in California is a naturalised American citizen. The brother and the sister in Chicago are not.

5. On 24 April 1967, LIENVOY reported the following call from GAZIYEV to LOGINOV:

GAZ: "I saw him, he arrived yesterday."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 203

LOG: "Excellent. Then I'd like to see you to discuss certain things."

GAZ: "Then I can come there tomorrow?"

LOG: "No, better Wednesday."

GAZ: "All right. He usually comes there at 6 o'clock. He got married and came here with his wife. Now they look for an apartment. I'll go there on the 10th, because I want to attend courses in English. This week I'll be busy."

LOG: "OK, until the next then."

6. From this conversation, it appeared that CAZIYEV was probably talking about Subject, since:

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted with GAZIYEV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although Subject told me he had not gone).

(b) Subject had gotten married that month.

(c) Subject had just returned to Mexico with his bride.

(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.

(e) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800 to teach evening Spanish classes.

7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had considered using Subject as an access agent against GAZIYEV, but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was developing into something more than occasional chats between classes. I did not see much potential in approaching Subject before this with theide the idea of having him deliberately cultivate a friendship with GAZIYEV, as I felt Subject was living


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 204

204

such a busy and hectic life that I would get very little out of him. Prior to his marriage, he was kooping such a hectic schedule botween his Institute and private classes that he wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the job with the American School (although he gave up most of his private classes).

8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's relations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I attempted to find out what I could about them from Subject. For a number of reasons, however--including my my going to the States in June--we were not able to get together until 11 July. On that date I took Subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a little Spanish restaurant downtown.

9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading. I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had developed any further. When I casually brought the conversation around to GAZİYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy, as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that they never talked politics. In reply to an offhand question about whether he had met any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

said that he had not. My inclination was to believe Subject, and I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been talking about someone else over the phone or that they had never gone boyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.

10. On 1 November 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother Javior in Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee. As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and would like my advice. He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience, he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was in El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security department" about his predicament. What did I think he should do?

11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice other than to tell him that it was entirely his own business whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a "black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew" the U.S. Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Embassy refused to give him any advice, at least it would make a record of his visit and anyone who was ever interested would his heart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said. After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the States to study sometime, and they might even want to go to the States to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very serious, I became more serious myself and told him that just so he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the proper Embassy department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy reception, but wished the U.S. Embassy to know he was doing it solely out of curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union. Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.

12. Seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given Subject the invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYEV was now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his own initiative, that he had also been to GAZIYEV's apartment twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he (Subject) got married (Subject was married about mid-April 1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'. Subject finished eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further, but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone another


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 207

time.

13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our home on 27 November, but the evening was not meant to and did not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further. Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the 7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he felt it was simply safer to stay away from the Soviet Embassy altogether. At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for lunch sometime in the near future.

14. For various reasons, including the poor state of Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, I played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested in anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details. Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered my questions to the best of his ability. It seemed to me, and still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject had not told me on 11 July what he subsequently told me on 1 November (1.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and on one occasion had met another Soviet there).. This was that he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too hard (which I didn't on 11 July), he felt more comfortable ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

Embassy over attending the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and felt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning the visits to GAZIYEV's home and meeting the other Soviet there.

15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went to Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV introduced the third person as Valentin "something." When I asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject immediately reacted and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV. GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and described LOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening started off very casually, with LOGI NOV expressing interest in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute. LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject if he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to start with, etc. Subject replied that he'd be happy to, although it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon. LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

209

with "no doubt" that he (LOGINOV) was trying to feel Subject out on his political views. Subject said that he couldn't remember most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory remarks about the extent of American influence in Mexico. Subject said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was "100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely no sympathy with Communism. (While this sounds awfully blunt and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good in my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to be *** a bit blunt at times, and khowing his ideological leanings, I would not put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject said that LOGINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject commented that he had a pretty good idea of what the Soviets were up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subject related the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone knew the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda."

16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

Subject said that LOGINOV seemed somewhat irritated with him, but on the whole kept his composure very well and treated Subject politely for the two hours or less Subject remained. As Subject was leaving, LOGINOV again said ho'd come by the Institute to ame Subject in the near future, but he nover did. "One day in late 1967 Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by name. However, they did not converse with each other.

17. Subject said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject returned to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his wife over to dinner (this would place the second dinner in about mid-May). This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only others present, and the evening passed without any reference to politics. Subject shated that he still occasionally goes across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV betweem evening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been to GAZIYEV's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his home.

18. Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose in meeting him was to assess his exploitability, he did not seem to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV'was an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I also explained that it was very possible GAZIYEV was using the Institute to spot other candidates for interviews with Soviet


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 211

intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV'S activities and contacts at the Institute. However, Subject said that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself at the Institute and did not have any particudar friends there whom Subject knew about. Subject said he would keep his eyes open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would let me know if he came onto anything interesting. Subject also offered to "play up to" GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance if I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions of appreciation.

19. The question that remins unanswered after all this is, of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject over the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while LOGI NOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took place about mid-May. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV told GAZİYEV on 24 April he wished to discuss with GAZIYEV concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on 24 April, it would appear that it was finally decided that GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase the memory of the first dinner.

Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

LYSUITCAGE/LIREAL-1

1. Headquarters has carefully considered the case of LIREAL-1 from the standpoint of ramifications of the compromise of January 1968 and of his operational utilization by the Station. With regard to the compromise, Headquarters tends to believe that the damage done by that occurrence is somewhat greater than the Station estimates. It is obvious, however, that no one now or probably even in the future can arrive at a hard estimate of the degree to which LIREAL-1 was blown. We can all agree and must assume that he has been compromised to some degree. The minimum degree of compromise would presumably be a listing of LIREAL-1's name in local Soviet files, and presumably also in the Moscow headquarters central registry, as "possible A. I. S." While such a label is unfortunate, could affect future assignments, and will limit his sphere of activity in Mexico, there remains a wide area of operations in which he can be employed. The Mexican authorities are, to the best of our knowledge, unaware of LIREAL-1's activities and sponsorship. Given the improved operational security patterns and overall professional handling which must accompany LIREAL-1's future use in the light of the unfortunate flap, we feel that he can continue to be of service at his present post. In spite of the obvious special need for a more careful weighing of operational risk versus gain factors (even more important here than in the case of the usual presumably "clean" non-official agent), we feel that neither the flap nor his LEOLODE status should inhibit the Station in the energetic use of his not inconsiderable talents. Headquarters can appreciate the necessarily slow pace of the developmental activity to which he has been assigned, as well as the required alterations of his targets both of which factors have been largely beyond Station control.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

2. In a written report on his visit to Mexico in December 1967, the visiting LIGLOSS case officer recapitulated the Station's Operational Flan for LIREAL-1 which included the following points:

a. "Penetration, nonitoring, analysis and study of the PRI are to be LIRSAL-1's first objective".....

b. (FRADYER) "urged LIRSALN to spot and assess potential legal travellers to Cuba."

c. "A strong tertiary target is the (HEFAIRY) Embassy."

d. "Indonesians, Egyptians and Soviets have been discarded as targets."

When talking to members of the Branch, Lewis W. BEAUCHAMP confirmed the above and said that the Station was considering giving LIRCALI-1 a going Cuban operation to handle. Has he yet been assigned any contacts which dear on the Cuban target? LIREALM-1 was quoted as saying that he feels he can handle a heavier operational load, and so we are hoping that you have or will soon be ablo to turn over to him one or more established operations from which he can see tangible return, thus broadening his experience and increasing his self-confidence. Since LIRELIC-1 has been terminated we assume Subject is exploring new areas against the LIOGLE/LIRELIC target and we would appreciate advice on this.

3. We recognize that very often one-time tasks, spotting, and research are performed by agents in the field without Headquarters' specific knowledge. Increased reporting on this kind of activity, which is valuable and necessary even though much of it may lead to dead ends, would give us a better under- standing than we now have of the contribution which LIREALU-1 is making to the Station. Headquarters appreciates the opera- tional reporting which the Station has been providing on LIREALM-1 and urges that it be continued on the same frequent basis.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

Action Required: FYI

1. During the April 1968 debriefing of AMSLOUCH/1 in the JMWAVE area, ANSLOUCH/1 provided the following information on Soviet officials with whom he is, or has been, acquainted:

a. Valentin LOGINOV (201-285412): Assigned to the Soviet Embassy in Havana several years ago. He pursued AMSLOUCH/3 (daughter of AMSLOUCHes 1 and 2) when stationed in Havana, and later in Moscow. AMSLOUCH/1 described LOGINOV as a rough peasant type. AMSLOUCH/1 when in Mexico about a year ago was looking at the Mexico Diplomatic List and noticed that a LOGINOV was assigned to Mexico. AMSLOUCH/1 asked a girl working at a foreign consulate in Mexico (identity) if this was the same LOGINOV who had been stationed in Cuba. The girl replied in the affirmative, and stated the LOGINOV worked in the Soviet Consulate handling business dealings between her consulate and the Soviet Consulate. The girl described LOGINOV as "a very nice fellow."

b. Colonel Fedor V. DREMOV: Military Attache, Soviet Embassy, Havana. ANSLOUCH/1 reported that he has conversed with DREMOV on several occasions, the last one being when Cosmonaut GUGARIN was killed. AMSLOUCH/1 described DREMOV as alert, smart, speaks good Spanish, charming and very proud that he is the son of a Cossak. DREMOV told AMSLOUCH/1 during one of their conversations that he had been a member

1. As reported in reference A, LIREALM-1 joined the PBRUMEN Section of this Station on 20 October 1967. It was decided that LIREALM-1 should drop further efforts against the Soviet, U.A.R., and Indonesian targets. The decision to discontinue efforts to develop contacts among Mexicans, also made at that timo, was later amended and LIREALM-1 was entrusted with the handling of LIRELIC-1 along the lines of the recommendation made in reference B. Thus, by November 1967 LIREALM-1 had two main responsibilities: a) the French target, against which he already had devoted considorable time and effort, and b) the handling of L'IRELIC-1.

2. LIREALM-1's effortis against the local Fronch target
   have produced some notable results. First, through detailed
   analysis of personality and other data provided by LIREALM-1,
   the Station selected an access agent to the official French
   community who_was later successfully contacted and was offered
   a contract (see reference C). The Station is already at work
   on what appears to be a good lead provided by the access
   agent spotted and developed by LIREALM-1. It should be
   emphasized that LIREALM-1 was in no way connected with the
   approach made to the French access agent. The second item
   on which IREALM-1 has made progress has been the development
   of a Mexican employee of the French Embassy who is used as a
   general courier inside the Embassy. This development, for
   security reasons, has been slow. LIREALM-1's "line" has been
   that a person with "the ability" of the courier can and
   should expect a better paying job than the one he currently
   holds. The courier ended up. taking that line as his own to
   "protect".him (as he probably would have some trouble if the
   Embassy discovered he was looking for another job). LIREALM-1.
   started-meeting the Mexican courier outside the Fronch Embassy.
   This gave LIREALM-1 the opportunity to talk to his prospect.
   at some length without attracting the attention of the members
   of the Embassy. This is as far as the Station will allow
   LIREALM-1 to go in this case, which is currently boing reviewed.
   to decide who will continue the development of the Embassy
   courier and how. LIREALM-1 will not, in any case, have any
   connection with the person selected for this task. He will
   continue to maintain contact with the courier but will start
   to see him less often and will admit, in the end, that finding
   a job for him turned out to be more difficult than expected.

3. LIREALM-1 meanwhile is continuing to cultivate a
   number of selected members of the French Embassy and reports
   on their activities as a matter of routine. He has also
   maintained contact for some months with a wealthy Mexican
   businessman who is a good friend of DEVOSJOLY, the ex-French
   intelligence officer who provided the material for Leon URIS'
   best seller Topaz. LIREALM-1, in fact, had established
   DEVOSJOLY's identity as coauthor of the book long before this
   became known publicly. He was shown by DEVOSJOLY's friend a
   safe at the latter's house in Mexico City full of documents
   probably belonging to DEVOSJOLY. This information was reported
   to. Headquarters via "special" channels.

4. LIREALM-1's handling of LIRELIC-1 encompasses two
   targets. By far the more important one is LIOGLE. The goal
   here is hopefully to turn LIRELIC-1 into a penetration of
   LIOGLE using several good contacts he has in this organization
   as a stepping stone. Some steps have been taken in this
   direction. LIRELIC-1 has addressed personal requests for
   -assistance to current key LIOGLE personalities. He has also
   submitted his curriculum vitae in the hope of landing a job
   in LIOGLE. This has so far failed to produce any concrete
   LIOGLE job offer. LIRELIC-1 realizes, of course, that he is
   of no value to LNHARP unless he obtains a job giving him access
   to hard information on LIOGLE plans and activities. The
   promise of a regular salary, as a matter of fact, is completely
   dependent on LIRELIC-l's ability to penetrate LIOGLE. In an
   effort to maintain interim contact, however, and help LIRELIC-1
   liquidate some personal debts, the Station, via LIREALM-1,
   made him a loan of 3,000 pesos. Further details on the LIOGLE
   aspects of the LIRELIC-1 operation will be covered in the
   forthcoming LIOGLE/LIRELIC progress report. In addition to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 225

SECRET/DESENSITIZED. HMMA - 34668

the above, the Station made an effort to explore the possibility
of using a contact which LIRELIC-1 had with a PBRUMEN citizen
in Acapulco to gain another window into LIRING. This PBRUMEN
citizen owns a small hotel in the Mexican resort occasionally
visited by LIRING personnel. Although LIRELIC-1 himself once
delivered a package sent by his Acapulco friend and managed to
have one or two meetings with representatives of the LIRING
Commercial Section (to discuss the possibility of "trading"
with PBRUMEN), it was decided in the end that LIRELIC-1's
access to LIRING was too superficial to be of any great benefit..
This decision was bolstered by the departure for PBRUMEN in
April 1968 of LIRELIC-1's PBRUMEN friend, who left for what
appears to be an extended visit to try to solve complicated
personal problems. Thus, with the "shelving" of possible
oporational activities against LIRING, LIOGLE became LIRELIC-1's
only target in April of this year',

5. Unlike his contacts with the French, LIREALM-1's
   dealings with LIRELIC-1 have been completely clandestine.
   LIREALM-1 meets LIRELIC-1 under alias in out of the way
   rostaurants and other public places. A drop constituted by a
   P. O, box rented by LIRELIC-1 under alias (to which both he
   and LIREALM-1. have keys) was set up for LIREALM-1 to receive
   operational messages,

6. References D and. E reviewed an incident which occurred
   on 16 January and had a direct bearing on LIREALN-1's security.
   It is the opinion of this Station that the person who saw
   LIREALM-1 talk with Raymond A. FRADYER and Wallace B. ROWTON
   did not positively identify either of them. References stated
   that this person could not have been Valentin Sergeyevich
   LOGINOV, who claimed to have observed the meeting. Reference E
   pointed out that before joining the PBRUMEN Section in October
   1967 LIREALM-1 had for some time interested himself in the
   activities of the Soviets at "Station request. He first made
   contact with LOGINOV, for example, in April 1967 and met with
   him on the average of once a week until October 1967.
   Reference E also pointed out that LIREALM-1 only had four
   meetings with the Soviet from October 1967 to January 1968..
   The Station wants to emphasize once more that these were all
   at LOGINOV's initiative. LIREALM-1 had discontinued his efforts
   to maintain contact with the Soviet at Station's directive.
   As pointed out above, one of the main targets now handled by
   LIREALM-1 is the French. One of the best places to meet
   Frenchmen is the French Club. Station would be very reluctant
   to have LIREALM-1, a long-time member of that club, terminate
   his membership. Neither does the Station want him to be too0.
   obvious in giving the cold shoulder to the Soviet. The Station
- does not believe, knowing what it knows of LOGINOV, that
  serious and permanent damage has been done to LIREALM-1's
  security and believes that he can continue to provide valuable
  services to this Station.

1. The purpose of this dispatch is to provide Headquarters with additional information requested in reference B in the hope that it will assist the interested components in formulating a clearer picture of the reference A incident. The Station has consulted at length with Wallace B. ROWTON on the details that are provided below as well as, of course, with LIREALM-1 himself.

2. First, with regard to paragraph 2b of reference B, a fuller account of the FRADYER/ROWTON/LIREALM-1 meeting at Sanborns will, it is felt, shed more light on the impressions that Headquarters had formed of the probable identification of ROWTON as LIREALM-1's "boss." The following chronological account has been prepared by ROWTON from his reports and memory in consultation with LIREALM-1 (the numbers in the left margin refer to the time at which the events mentioned below took place):

1610 (January 16) LIREALM-1 met with ROWTON at the latter's home as planned. ROWTON informed LIREALM-1, much to the latter's disappointment, that unfortunately he had not as yet received the reimbursement for operational expenses ($2,357.35 MN) requested by LIREALM-1 on 10 January 1968, nor had he received from the

Station any contract or other document that LIREALM-1 might present to LIRELIC-1 as he had proposed. ROWTON explained to LIKEALM-1 that he had hoped to be able to see Raymond A. FRADYER before his meeting with LIREALN-1, but that this had been impossible.

1620 ROWTON then telephoned FRADYER's office (in alias, open code, and double talk) and this time managed to reach FRADYER himself. FRADYER told ROWTON that he had the money and could pass it to ROWTON that same afternoon if he felt it necessary. RONTON replied that he preferred to pick it up as soon as convenient for FRADYER and made a date for 1630 in the corridor outside the Koala Restaurant, about three or four minutes by foot from Sanborns. ROWTON then asked LIREALN-1 to wait for him in the downstairs bar of Sanborns, where he would join him, with the money. LIREALM-1 left ROWTON's home alone, and ROWTON followed about five minutes later and proceeded (by taxi) to the Koala Restaurant. ROWTON distinctly recalls waiting for FRADYER for some 15 minutes.

1645 ROWTON spoke with FRADYER for about two minutes in the corridor after receiving the envelope containing the money. In reply to FRADYER's queries, ROWTON stated that LIREALM-1 was somewhat disappointed that he could not provide him with some sort of written contract for LIRELIC-1 and also because of the delay in reimbursing him for operational expenses (some of which had been disallowed). ROWTON then revealed to FRADYER that LIREALM-1 was waiting for him at the Sanborns bar so that he could pass him the money without further delay. FRADYER then regretted that he had been unable to see LIREALM-1 personally to explain the disallowance of some of the expenses. ROWTON suggested that FRADYER might take this opportunity to say a few words to LIREALM-1, especially since the latter knew that ROWTON and FRADYER were meeting at that moment somewhere nearby. FRADYER agreed but said that he preferred the gift section of Sanborns to the bar.

1655 ROWTON then proceeded alone to the downstairs bar of Sanborns and found LIREALM-1 waiting. ROWTON explained that he was late because of a last-minute arrangement with FRADYER for a brief meeting in the gift shop. LIREALM-1 then paid the bill and accompanied ROWTON up the stairs in the rear to the gift section, where they found FRADYER looking over the silver display in the shop.

1700 An apparently casual conversation then took place, with FRADYER and LIREALM-1 doing most of the talking and with ROWTON occasionally examining the silverware on display.

1720 When the conversation ended, ROWTON and LIREALM-1 moved to the men's room, where LIREALM-1 was able to check the amount of money for him and sign the enclosed receipt.

3. It will be noted from the above that the ROWTON/ LIREALM-1 meeting with FRADYER was not planned in advance. (as pointed out in reference A), but was a hasty recommendation made to FRADYER by ROWTON and an equally hasty decision taken by FRADYER on the spot. ROWTON and LIREALM-1 had met previously only in ROWTON's home, except on two occasions when ROWTON picked up LIREALM-1 in his car in the Ciudad Deportes (near the main Mexico City bull ring) between regular meetings to pass him funds. ROWTON had never met with LIREALM-1 at Sanborns or in any other public place prior to this meeting.

4. LIREALM-1 also amplified his written report sub- sequently in one significant detail. In reference to the remark of LOGINOV to the offect that he had seen him with his boss at Sanborns two Wednesdays previously when "you had a drink in the bar and then talked to your boss," LIREALM-1 told ROWTON on reflection that LOGINOV had also stated that "you were having a drink at the bar and a man came up to you and brought you to your boss." This indicates that FRADYER was meant as the person described as LIREALM-l's boss.

5. With regard to where and how often ROWTON and LIREALM-1 have had operational mootings in the past, as requested in paragraph 3 of reference B, Station files show that between 20 October 1967 and 16 January 1968 ROWTON met with LIREALM-1 at his home ten times. Besides these meetings with LIREALM-1 at his home, ROWTON recalls only two other moetings with LIREALM-1, when he picked up LIREALM-1 in his car for brief meetings to pass him funds. Since the LOGINOV/LIREALM-1 episode, ROWTON has met with LIREALM-1 at obscure bars to avoid possible positive identification of ROWTON in the event LIREALM-1 was under surveillance. LIREALM-1 has passed his reports to ROWTON between their weekly meetings via a P.O. letter drop taken out previously by LIREALM-1 under alias. The only telephone contact that has existed between them has been brief calls to ROWTON's home by LIREALM-1 alerting ROWTON, in double talk, that he has left an envelope at the drop.

6. With regard to the frequency of LÍREALM-1's meetings with LOGINOV, mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference B, LIREALM-1's contact reports list only four meetings during the same period, all of which occurred at the French Club, and one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at which very few words were exchanged. It is significant to notę, however, that at the 12 November 1967 meeting, while LIREALM-1 and LOGINOV were chatting in the showers after the match, the latter "joked that (LIREALM-1) should bring some of his friends from the Embassy" to join them in playing tennis. LOGINOV added, also apparently with a slight grin, "all of them are WOFIRM." FRADYER, to whom this remark was promptly reported, did not consider it to have any special meaning since he knew from personal and direct experience tha: LOGINOV is a born provocateur who cannot resist needling people (Mexicans and foreigners) with whom he comes into contact. WOFIRM often comes up in LOGINOV conversations, not only with FRADYER, but with persons of other nationalities. It was decided, however, to again warn LIREALM-1 at his next meeting with ROWTON on 16 November, when LIREALM-1 submitted his report, not to involve himself with LOGINOV. LIREALM-1 assured ROWTON that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 229

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH
SECRET
DESENSITIZED
HNMA - 31570

his continuing contacts with LOGINOV were at the latter's initiative and that LIREALM-1 would not make any attempt to follow up or show any unusual interest. LIREALM-1 did not report seeing LOGINOV again until 13 January 1968 (two months later) this time, as usual, on the tennis court.

7. Headquarters will recall that the LIREALM-1 relation- ship with the Soviets dates back many months prior to the date ROWTON took over his handling. The file reveals that LIREALM-1 first met LOGINOV on 22 April 1967, and that at that timo LOGINOV proposed to LIREALM-1 that they meet regularly, every Wednesday, for tennis and occasionally take in a movie with their wives. This leaves no doubt that the pace was set by LOGINOV himself since he undoubtedly saw in LIREALM-1 a potential target. The situation was further complicated by the character and modus operandi of LOGINOV, as well as the limitations of LIREALM-1's cover situation at the time.

8. A principal dilemma facing the Case Officer with regard to LIREALM-1's exposure to the Soviets has been his regular attendance at the French Club. Since the French target has been one of the main ones left to LIREALM-1 after the elimination of the Soviet, Indonesian, and UAR operations, it was considered necessary for LIREALM-1 to continue his normal contacts with the French. He could have dropped his membership in the club to avoid further involvement with the Soviets, but this would have broken a long-established pattern and deprived him of his principal access at that time. It was therefore ruled out as counterproductive.

9. Subsequent developments appear to confirm the Station's view that LOGINOV based his provocative remark on a hunch or, at most, on a strong suspicion concerning LIREALM-1. As mentioned in paragraph 1 of reference B, such prolonged social contact between an American and a Soviet "is almost inevitably construed on both sides to have intel- ligence connotations." The Station wishes to emphasize, however, that whatever suspicions were aroused in the mind of LOGINOV concerning LIREALM-1 were already generated months before he joined the PBRUMEN Section in late October 1967.

10. In conclusion, the Station feels that nothing has been noted in the subsequent operational activity of FRADYER or ROWTON to indicate that either of them has been identified as an intelligence operative. ROWTON has had no contact of any kind with Soviets in this area, nor has he detected any surveillance, either physical or technical, of his person or home. Both he and FRADYER, however, will continue to maintain maximum security to avoid any further exposure to such persons as LOGINOV. LIREALM-1, on his part, has been able to improve his cover by opening an office and making his overt activity as plausibly commercial as possible.

REVERENCE: ICNA-34303, 3 April 1963

1. Reference caused deep concern in Headquarters -- concern which we know you share. To hold any agent meetings in that particular Sanborn Cafeteria is unorthodox enough, but to meet there with someone in the category of LIRE/1, whose cover is of special importance, suggests an unawareness or disdain of basic operational security which merits reprimand.

2. We appreciate your candid account of the LIREALI/1-LOCINOV episode, and have several comments to make:

a. Why LOGINOV would have said, "I saw you talking with your boss the other day" we do not know, but the fact that he made such a banal remark with a slight grin certainly implies that he did not have ordinary commercial business in mind.

b. In the context of the dispatch it sounds rather as though LOONOV was referring to a meeting between LIRE/1 and one other man, not two, in which case it was probably ROWTON and not FRADYER when he identified as the boss. (We assume that ROWTON and LINEAL/1 had been together in the downstairs cafeteria before the brush meeting with FRADYER took place, but this may be incorrect.)

3. In order to shed some additional light on the matter, we would like to know even more about this particular Wednesday meeting and the pattern of meetings which have preceded and followed it. Were ROWTON and LIREALI/L meeting together in the bar or cafeteria? What was the appearance of the later three-way, fifteen-minute conversation upstairs in the silver shop (i.e.; casual, serious, intense, sotto-voce, conspiratorial? Was any pretense made of "shopping"?) Our feeling is that ROWTON is as much compromised as

LIREALM/1, but in ROWTON's case the less is less because of accepted risks in his style of operating and since we have always assumed that his cover was thin . What is important to know in this case is where and how often ROWTON and LIREALM/1 have had operational meetings in the past. Considering this we had assumed the ROWTON-LIREALM/1 meetings were truly clandestine.

4. Another point to be resolved is the frequency of LIREALM/1's meetings with LOGINOV -- from the Reference we infer that the tennis games were a frequent occurrence, although LIREALM/1 had been told almost a year ago to break contact. Even if these meetings could not have been avoided as the Station claims, why were they not reported? The issue takes on even added significance as we understood the Station and Headquarters had been in agreement for some time that LIREALM/1 was to avoid any continuing contact with Soviets. Hindsight in this case certainly proves the correctness of the earlier judgment. (Experience shows that prolonged social contact between an American and a Soviet is almost inevitably construed on both sides, and with reason, to have an intelligence connotation.)

5. The fact that LOGINOV did not mention the Sanborn's meeting to FRADYER can hardly be read to mean that LIREALM/1 is clean in LOGINOV's eyes, although FRADYER would naturally have been anxious to see what, if anything, would happen when he next saw LOGINOV face to face. It is true that we have no evidence that LIREALM/1 has been "definitely branded as a VOFIRM operator" but if he is even highly suspect there is still cause for deep concern.

6. Various levels and components at Headquarters are trying to evaluate and debate this episode, and we would like to have your recommendations as an aid to our decision. From the few facts that we have we believe we must proceed under the assumption that LIREALM/1 is suspect or possibly compromised in the eyes of the Soviets. Accepting this, do you consider LIREALM/1 has further utility in Mexico? If so, we would like your views as to his proposed targets and handling procedures. After receiving further details as requested in paragraph 3 and your recommendations, Headquarters will advise you its decision.

7. We recognize the Station is as disturbed about this breach of basic operational judgment as Headquarters and do not wish to belabor the point. We trust however that this experience will be a lesson well learned and that in the future the Station's clandestine operational procedures will be truly clandestine and professional in style for all of the Station activities, not just LIREALM/1.

1. Since joining the staff of the PBRUMEN Section of this Station in October 1967, LIREALM-1 has been handled by Wallace B. ROWTON under the over-all supervision of the undersigned. His three main activities have been 1) to handle LIRELIC-1, an asset who we hope will turn into a penetration of the Mexican PRI, 2) to continue to develop rapport with and report on the local official French community, and 3) to determine the degree to which LIRELIC-1 can develop access to LIRING and its personnel. LIREALM-1 has continued to see a number of contacts he had developed before joining the PBRUMEN Section, either at Station directive or by social encounter. One of these contacts has long been Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, Second Secretary of the Soviot Embassy and known KGB officer whom LIREALM-1 first ran into while playing tennis at the French Club, where both LIREALM-1 and LOGINOV are members. Station several times asked LIREALM-1 to break contact with LOGINOV, but this has not been possible since LIREALM-1's continued membership at the French Club is desired for operational reasons and LOGINOV, who probably joined the club for similar reasons, has continued to be one of its active members.

2. In January 1968 LIREALM-1 presented an accounting for reimbursement by the Station to which the Station took exception. Some of the entertainment of marginal assets involved totals which the Station found to be excessive. The result of this was that after some deliberation LIREALM-1 had to pay for part of these expenses out of his pocket. On 17 January 1968 ROWTON called the undersigned to ask about reimbursement of those expenses allowed by the Station... A brush contact was arranged for this purpose in the passage-way leading to the Koala Restaurant, as ROWTON indicated that LIREALN-1 needed the money as soon as possible. At the agreed time the undersigned passed an envelope to ROWTON, who informed the undersigned that LIREALN-1 was waiting in the downstairs cafeteria of the Sanborns building. The undersigned, who had not seen LIREALM-1 at Christmas time and genuinely regretted the fact that the latter had to pay for operational expenses out of his pocket, agreed to see LIREALM-1 for a few minutes. When the undersigned refused to go to the downstairs Sanborns cafeteria, ROWTON suggested that he fetch LIREALM-1 and bring him to the silver shop upstairs in the same building. A 15-minute meeting (longer than expected) onsued between ROWTON, LIREALM-1, and the undersigned in a corner of the Sanborns silver shop. The meeting started a few minutes before 1700 hours.

3. On 28 January LIREALM-1 saw LOGINOV at the French Club. The following is a verbatim extract of the report written by LIREALM-1 on this meeting.

I had joined Val and my wife on her side of the court for small talk with Val. He apologized for interrupting our game and suggested we go back to playing and he would watch us. We had made. a. date for tennis Wednesday. He would call me if his leg still bothered him or for any other reason he was unable to play. Now he said he wanted to study my game so that he could beat me Wednesday. Val walked with me as far as the net where he stopped me and the following conversation took place.

"I saw you talking with your boss the other day," Val said with a slight grin.

"My boss?" I asked. I suspected nothing and seriously considered the question. I began to search back in my mind if my cover boss had ever met Val. I recalled that I had once pointed Val out to him. The conversation proceeded too rapidly, for me to answer my own question. The fact is that Val has never met my cover boss.

"Yes. At Sanborns two Wednesdays ago. You had a drink in the bar and then talked to your boss."

"Two Wednesdays ago... At Sanborns? No. You're mistaken. My boss left about six weeks ago--almost two months ago. No. I don't think I was at Sanborns." I answered Val honestly confused. I began to wonder who I had been with. I've often met people in the various Sanborns. I was trying to think who Val was confusing with my boss.

"Yes. Your boss. You and your boss were talking together at the Sanborns next to your embassy."

"No Val. My boss left at least two months ago. I can't recall the particular meeting at Sanborns that you are referring to, but I'll drink with anyone, anywhere, anytime." Val and I laughed. Until this moment I was answering him honestly and sincerely and might have been very convincing.

As it began to dawn on me what Val was driving
at I turned my back and started for the baseline.
It was then that I felt weak and my face would have
betrayed me if I had still been facing Val. By
the time I reached the baseline I was composed.
We spoke no further except to comment on good shots
by mo or my wife during the next five or ten minutes
that ho stood watching us.

4. The undersigned reported the above to his superiors
   as soon as ho received LIREALM-1's report. A check of the
   LIEMPTY log for 17 January showed that LOGINOV had left the
   Soviet Embassy at 1404 and had returned at 1708 hours. This
   mado his presence at Sanborns at the time of the meeting
   between LIREALM-1, ROWTON, and the undersigned impossible,
   as it would have given him about 10 minutes to leave the site
   of the mooting, get into his car, and drive to the Soviet
   Embassy, an impossible feat even in light traffic. It is
   clear thon that LOGINOV was not present at the time of the
   meeting but was told that LIREALM-1 met with two Americans.-Y
   It was and still is the undersigned's conviction that whoever
   saw LIREALM-1 was unable to positively identify ROWTON or
   thoundorsigned. The undersigned reasons that had LOGINOV
   known that ho, the undersigned, had talked to LIREALM-1,
   LOGINOV would have montioned his name after failing to
   obtain any reaction from LIREALM-1 from mentioning the
   latter's "boss" The undersigned believes that LOGINOV, whó
   is not completely stupid, would have either said nothing or
   would have gone all the way in his statements to LIREALM-1
   had he known the undersigned's name. By the same token it
   appears that LOGINOV failed to identify ROWTON. The
   undersigned had only met with one other Soviet besides
   LOGINOV at the time of the meeting, and that only once; and
   that Soviet was no longer in Mexico City when the meeting
   with LIREALM-1 took place. ROWTON has never had any contact,
   social or otherwise, with any of the Soviets.

5. The undersigned is the first to recognize that meeting
   with LIREALM-1 at the Sanborns silver shop was a thoroughly
   unwise move. He wishes to emphasize that this was the only
   meeting at the time that he had held with LIREALM-1 outside
   of a safehouse. All meetings between the undersigned and
   LIREALM-1 have since been held under the most secure con-
   ditions on the edge of the Federal District and, in one case,
   beyond. While this does not make this decision any wiser, he
   also wants to emphasize the fact that it was made on the spur
   of the moment, to quote the old cliche, because the undersigned
   "felt sorry" for LIREALM-1 because of the latter's financial
   difficulties with the Station over his last accounting. The
   undersigned unwisely put LIREALM-1's morale for a brief moment
   over basic security considerations. He is not in the habit
   of doing this as a matter of course.. The day before his next
   scheduled tennis meeting with LIREALM-l the following Wednesday,
   LOGINOV called LIREALM-1 and asked to be excused as his leg
   had worsoned. The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his
   regular tennis game with LIREALM-1 but made no mention of
   his previous conversation with him two weeks before. The
   undersigned waited to complete a review of this case until
   he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association
   functions. Because of the visits of Soviet athletes and
   artists which kept LOGINOV busy, however, this meeting did not
   materialize until 28 March. Although the undersigned and
   LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for more than two hours
   on this occasion during a visit to the local Home Fair, LOGINOV
   never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting. He has
   never brought LIREALM-1's name to the attention of the
   undersigned.

6. During a recent visit to the Station, a representative of the LPGLOBE staff at Headquarters was given the complete details of the above incident by LIREALM-1. He also reviewed the same incident with the undersigned and the Deputy Chief of Station. The LPGLOBE representative mentioned on this occasion that in his opinion the above incident should have been reported by cable. The undersigned stated then and wants to repeat now that this was not done because 1) it would have served no purpose to alert Headquarters without giving all the facts, which were not known at the time, and 2) the Station wanted to review all elements of this case to report the incident objectively, fairly, and completely. The undersigned told the LPGLOBE representative that he would consider documentation of this case complete after having the opportunity of meeting LOGINOV face to face again. As pointed out above, this did not occur until 28 March. Nothing in the operations conducted by the undersigned, LIREALM-1, or ROWTON has indicated that the Soviets positively identified either the undersigned or ROWTON so as to definitely brand LIREALM-1 as a NOFIRM operator.

FROM Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT REDTOP LCIMPROVE - Identification of KGB Officers Who Participated In Counter-Surveillance of 201-827966

REFERENCE: (A) HMMW-16090, 15 January 1968
(B) MEXICO CITY 4777, 9 March 1968
(C) EMMA-34264, 11 March 1968

1.  On 8 March 1968 after 201-827966 failed to show for two scheduled meetings (on the previous evening he had agreed to submit to a debriefing), the area of his hotel was checked by the undersigned. On a main street near the hotel the undersigned almost bumped into Valentin S. LOGINOV (201-138139). A few minutes later Ivan K BARANOV (201-277838) was observed photographing the area (including the undersigned) with an 8mm movie camera. LOG INOV was standing near BARANOV observing the undersigned. LILYRIC reports that LOGINOV and BARANOV were absent together from the Soviet Embassy during the period in question.

2.  Another meet with 201-827966 was arranged by telephone for 12:30 on 9 March. From 12:28 to 12:48 the entrance to the hotel where the meeting took place was staked out by BARANOV and Vladimir A. DOLGOV (201-763035). BARANOV was carrying a 35mm camera with a larger telephoto lens. Visual identification of DOLGOV was tenative. However in view of LILYRIC reports that DOLGOV was absent from the Soviet Embassy for the period in question and that all other possible candidates were accounted for, the identification has been confirmed. In addition we have photos of DOLGOV wearing sunglasses identical to the ones he wore during the counter-surveillance.

3.  Although we have had previous indications that DOLGOV is probably a KGB officer the Station feels that his participation in this counter-surveillance is sufficient to list him as known KGB.

4.  We can also add photographer to BARANOV's technical duties.

10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, HABITS:

a. All sources agree in describing Subject as smooth and completely self-controlled. He is an aggressive conversationalist. One source described him as vulgar, crude, ill-mannered, short-tempered and a tyrant, who thinks he is a big shot. (8)

b. Subject seems to have made a play for every girl he has met. In at least one instance he has claimed to be unmarried when inviting a girl out. (27) When his wife was staying in the dacha in Cuernavaca he reportedly made dates with other women. (8) On 13 September 1966 he was seen in a cafe with a Méxican-looking woman. (18)

11. CURRICULUM VITAE:

Subject claims that he has served in the Red Army. (8)

(Subject's name was reportedly listed in February 1960 as about to be assigned to buenos Aires as Soviet Military Attache; it would appear that either this was another person with the same name, or that Subject was being considered for assignment there as D diplomatic attache.)

12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION: Known KGB, based on his having taken over an agent previously handled by known KGB officers Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPOREΝΚΟ (201-305870) and Aleksandr Vladimirovich PRIKHODKO (201-202379), as well as his other intelligence activities given below.

13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES:

(Cf. also information under Contacts, below. Subject has undoubtedly been developing contacts, particularly with American girls, with a view toward intelligence possibilities.)

a.  In December 1961 while travelling with the Dynamo soccer team, Subject met a Bolivian security service official in La Paz, Bolivia and reportedly tried to persuade him to study in Cuba. The source, however, is believed to be a fabricator. (28)

b.  After Subject saw the soccer team off, he continued to Panama, where he met with a Mexican citizen, Edmundo Fausto ZORRILLA Martinez (P-2818) on 16 December 1961. On 17 December 1961 Subject and ZORRILLA travelled to Mexico City on the same plane. Subject had ca. (US) $2000 with him in Panama. (29)

c.  On 14 February 1966 KGB officer Aleksandr Vladimirovich FRIKHODO (201-202379) turned an agent over to Subject. (The agent had previously been handled by Subject's predecessor, Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPCRENKO.) On 14 April 1966 the agent attempted to break his intelligence relationship with the Soviets, although he has remained in business and socal contact with them. Subject, occasionally joined by PRIKHODKO, has continued to give intelligence requirements to the agent, who has questioned him particularly about his access to the U.S. Embassy and tried to persuade him to continue cooperating with the KGE. On 24 June 1966 Subject asked the agent for information on Eduardo WEBELMAN and his son Mauricio. On 13 December 1966- Subject asked the agent to try to find out who the WOFIRM chief in Mexico was. (6). (COMMENT: Mauricio WEBELMAN was subsequently reported to be a friend of suspect AGB officer Yevgeniy Nikolayevich GCRLITSYN'S, 201-773422).

Subject's first assignment to the policeman was to locate Venezuelan citizens Nicolas Juan BOSTROEM and wife. (16) (COMMENT: Nothing further has been learned about this case. ECSTROEM Is a native Russian employed by Stephens- Adamson de Mexico, his wife teaches Russian at the Ibero- American University.)

## 15. CONTACTS:

### a. Soviet:

1) Subject has been seen coming and going at the Soviet Embassy most frequently with Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV (201-120123, known KGB), whom Subject replaced as Consul. Since Subject's departure for home leave on 16 July 1967, YATSKOV has been regularly using Subject's car. Subject has also been observed leaving the Soviet Embassy fairly often with Ivan Konstantinovich BARANOV (201-277838, known KGB sweeper) and Boris Aleksandrovich MALAKHOVICH (201-767974, suspect KCB technician). Subject has also borrowed the cars of YATSKOV and known KGB chauffeur Vasiliy Stepanovich MIROSHNIKOV (201-273046). (7)

2) In May 1966 Subject reportedly gave the wife of Aleksandr Aleksandrovich NIKITIN (201-784917, known KGb) a hard time when she wanted to send her son to the USSR with another Soviet wife. NIKITIN then complained to Aleksandr Vladimirovich PRIKHODRO (201-202379, known KGB), who reportedly ordered Subject to get a ticket for the NIKITIN child. (1) Cf. also above, where PRIKHODKO seems to be the senior case officer for an agent currently being handled by Subject.

3) In May 1967 LOGINOVA mentioned that she had known Boris Aleksandrovich CHMYKOV (201-268115, known GRU) for years. (1) (COMMENT: CHMYKHOV was statoned in Havana 1960-62, at the same time that Subject was there.) Cf. below for report of Subject's having taken CHNYKHOV with him to Cuernavaca to meet ZAREDSKI.

Subject has also been reported in contact with the following Soviets not stationed in Mexico:

4) Vitaliy Konstantinovich BOYAROV (201-355606, known KGB), visited Mexico 27 May - 9 June 1966. On 1 June 1966 Subject and P.A. VATSKOV were absent from the Soviet Embassy for four hours with BOYAROV. (7)

(1)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 245

# 15. CONTACTS: Continued

## a. Soviet:

6) Boris Semenovich IVANOV (201-078078, known KGB), visited Mexico 8-22 February 1967. Subject made reservations for IVANOV in Mexico City and probably saw him off at the airport. (1).

7) Yuriy Vladimirovich LEBEDEV (201-213261), Minister Counselor at the Soviet Embassy in Havana. On 7 February 1966 Subject was reported sending something to LEBEDEV with a Soviet professor who was travelling back to Moscow via Havana. (1)

## b. Non-Soviet:

1) Alonso AGUILAR Monteverede (P-2152, 201-334259), active Marxist intellectural.

On 28 June 1967 AGUILAR reminded Subject that they and their wives were invited for Saturday evening to the home of Alberto PENICHE. (1). (Alberto PENICHE Blanco, P-12294, manager of centrist newspaper El Heraldo de Mexico and reported as minor contributor to the PCM in 1964.)

2) (Mrs.) Gloria *ALFARO, no other traces.

On 5 February 1966 Mrs, fnu ALFARO (Possibly Gloria) wanted to talk to Subject to congratulate him on a Soviet moon probe. (1) On 22 June 1966 Gloria ALFARO reminded Subject that they had met at the house of Mrs. SOTO (possibly Graciala, q.v.) on Christmas Eve 1965 and invited Subject to a party. Subject was unable to go but said he would call Gloria for coffee. Gloria gave her telephone as 35-71-30 (listed in 1964 to Yolanda ALFARO Vda de CACERES, Buitrago, Chiapas 130-A, current telephone 25-10-24). (1) Also on 22 June 1966 Gloria ALFARO told Subject she would like to talk with some of the Soviets, and Subject suggested getting together on Friday "after English class". (17)
(COMMENT: ALFARO may have been studying English with Subject at the Instituto de Interpretes y Traductores.)
On 3 August 1966 Gloria and Subject tried to agree on a date to get together, and she said she would like for him to meet a friend (female) of hers who was visiting Mexico from Central America. (1)

3) Ofelia ALFARO Lopez (P-11339), professor of economics at UNAM, good friend of the wife of Antonio SARMIENTO (q.v), social contact with several Soviets.

4) (Dr.) Juan Luis ALVAREZ Gayou, teacher at UNAM and Deputy Director of Instituto de Interpretes y Traductores.

Subject presumably met ALVAREZ at the Instituto, where Subject is believe to have studied English. The first reported contact was on 11 April 1966, when they spoke to each other, using the familiar form of address, about having missed each other in Cuernavaca. Subject was invited to ALVAREZ' birthday party. Subject said he would see ALVAREZ the following day when he was going to have class with a new teacher. On 13 June 1966 Frofessor fnu ALVAREZ, Juan Luis" father, asked Subject if he would bring the projector to the Instituto de Interpretes y Traductores, and Subject said he would. Cn 12 July 1966 ALVAREZ, who had been out of town, asked Subject if he wanted to continue taking lessons, and Subject said yes, he would go there the following day.

REDCOAT/Termination of Contact with Subject of Reference

REFERENCE: HMMW-15980, 7 December 1967

1. A draft dispatch on Subject of Reference was prepared in August, but through an oversight, was never typed and sent out. As stated in that draft, Mexico City Station no longer has any operational interest in Subject and does not plan to seek an Operational Approval for her. We regret this delay in reporting. The text of the draft dispatch follows.

2. Subject advised on 2 August 1967 that she planned to leave for the United States within the next two weeks to marry an American citizen and would thereafter settle in New York City. She identified her fiance as:

Marty HARRIS
Age 35.
152 E. 35th St.
New York, N.Y.
Tel. 686-0544

She said he is a textile engineer, but that she did not know the name of the firm he worked for. HARRIS, according to Subject, is Jewish. She said they will be married in early September in a

synagogue ia Philadelphia, which is HARRIS's parents' boze. They vill thereafter take up residence at HARRIS's current New York addrese.

3. Subject said that she had originally met HARRIS vaile be vas vacationing in Mexico and had maintained a correspondence with him. In July of this year, be called her from New York and asked her to meet him in Cozumel the rock of 24 July. During a veek together in Cozumel, they decided to get married. Subject said she thought that one day she would like to return to Mexico with her husband to live, but that their present plans were to remain in New York indefinitely.

4. In view of Subject's plans to leave Mexico indefinitely, we no longer have any operational interest in her and do not plan to seek an Operational Approval for ber.

5. Subject stated she had had no social contact with Valentin Sergoyevich LOGINOV (201-355412) since December 1966, although she had seen him several times on business since thon. She reported on 11 May that her only noteworthy encounter with his siace December took place in April in connection connection with efforts on her part to secure a Soviet visa for a leftist client of hers. LOGINOV balked at granting the visa because of alleged personal dislike. of the applicant, but finally gave in as a "personal favor" to Subject. He stated bluntly, however, that Subject should realise "a favor must be repaid by a favor and renewed in much more direct ters a prior request that Subject introduce him to someone anong ber friends who was or was inclined to be syapathetic toward the Soviet Union. Subject replied somewhat flippantly that she'd keep the request in mind in case she not or thought of anyone in this category. (Subject had earlier reported that LOGINOV had eace specifically asked her if she had any friends in LAPURE, but that she had dodged the question and he had not pursued it.)

6. LICOZY-5 told Francis J. COIGNE in June 1967 that on 5 June LOGINOV had pressed him for information on the local Jovish reaction to the Arab-Israeli war. LICOZY-5 also stated that on 6 June Subject, who was very excited about the war and had even gone to the Israeli Babaasy to volunteer to serve in Israel, had told aim that when she returned home frea work on the evening of 5 June, LOGINOV was waiting for her on the street and tried to pump her for information on local Jewish reactions to the var. LICORY-5 stated that Subject told him abe gave LOGINOP bell for the Soviets' support of the Arabs.

7. LICOZY-5 stated that Subject told him that in March she had been called to LAPURE and had been asked about her contact with LOGINOV. She added, according to LICOZY-S, that she had seen the sane LNPURE officer (no name given, according to LICOZY-5) a couple wecks earlier. LICOZY-5 said that she also told him that LOGINOV had asked her to introduce him to "one of her progressive friends". or "someone in LAPURS.

8. The above represented a capsule account of Subject's relationship with her case officer, Keith B. LEVENDERIS. COIGNS played innocent until he got the whole story, but finally adaitted that we had talked to the girl. COIGNE told LICUAY-S that Subject had no idea that he was in contact with us and had in fact worried that her activities in our behalf aight create trouble for ata. Asked by COTONE what advice he had given Subject, LICUZY-5 said that he had told her to be truthful with the LAPURA officer and to be careful with LOGINOV.

9. On 2 August, during a very friendly "farewell" lunch, LEVENDERIS asked Subject both about her most recent contacts vith LOGINOV and whether anyone know of her contact with IMPURE. (She had previously given the strongest assurances that she could be counted ou to keep this contact confidential.) Fith respect to

the first question, ads stated that LOGIROV had come to her office a couple of times on visa and Soviet travel business, but that she otherwise had not seen him. Although given anple opportunity, she said nothing about LOGINOV having waited for her in front of ber-apartment or about his questioning her about local reaction to the Israeli-Arab var. As for the second question, she assured LEVENDERIS that she had told no one of ber contact with him or LOURE.

10. We are inclined to believe that Subject lied about not telling anyone of her contact with us because it would have been extremely embarrassing for her to admit that she bad failed both to follow instructions and to keep her promise. romise. While it is un- certain exactly why she did tell LICOZY-5, the apparent timing (the second day of the Israeli-Arab var) suggests it was the result of her agitated state of mind, her anger at the Soviets for their support of the Arabs, her possible imminent departure for Israel and the uncertainty of her fate, and her varm regard and respect for LICOZY-5 as a fellow pro-Zionist. (Subject, whose Bother is Jewish and who becase romantically involved with Israel and Zionisa after visiting Israel a couple of years ago, told LEVENDERIS on 2 August that she had indeed gone to the Israeli Embassy to volunteer to serve in Israel and had been insediately accepted because she had had training in nursing. She said she had been told to stand by for transportation to Israel and bad expected to be called literally at any minute. She said that the brevity of the war had unde her services unnecessary, however.)

11. While it is clear Subject lied about not having revealed. her contact with LAPURE to anyone, we are inclined to believe that LICOZY-5 sade up the story of LOGINOV waiting for Subject in front of her apartment and questioning her about local reaction to the war. Knowing LICOZY-5, it seema very possible that he invented the story in order to explain why Subject confided in him. 1.., sho was already emotionally upset about the war and when LOGINOV contacted her she understandably told Subject, which led to her rovealing the whole story. In any event, we consider the case clozed and do not intend to pursue the question of who is telling the truth with LICOZY-5.

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT : Elizabeth Duncan WILDE

DATE OF MEETING : 12 December 1967

1. A Headquarters officer made arrangements by telephone for me to interview Subject on 12 December. She was told that I would arrive at Toledo at 10:30 and call her. However, my plane developed mechanical trouble and I called her from Pittsburg to advise that I would be 3 hours late. I arrived at Toledo at 13:30 and called her. We agreed that I would come to her mother's apartment at 14:30. The interview lasted from 14:30 to 18:30. During the last hour we were joined by her mother but, since she is senile and hard of hearing, we were able to continue talking without interruption.

2. I introduced myself as Peter Clark from the Embassy in Mexico. Subject accepted me without question and immediately began telling her story which was about the same as we had received from the political officer. The telling took only 10 minutes. I had considerable difficulty in taking her through a chronological account and holding her to one subject. It became obvious that she is a very self-centered person who is not interested in others unless they make a strong impression on her which LOGINOV obviously did. She is impossible on names, dates or times, asking me at least three times during the interview to repeat my name. On the other hand she was completely cooperative and did not appear to be withholding or distorting information.

3. The following account of her contacts are pieced together from her chaotic account and, thus, is by no means perfect:

a. She was in Mexico about 10 days on her most recent trip and met LOGINOV about a week before she left (ca 10 November). She met him at a party given by a Spanish couple (names forgotten) at their home in the southern part of the city to which her host, Dr. Frederico MARIN (see below) had been invited. It was a large party which included Mexicans, foreigners and diplomats. She met LOGINOV through a German man whom she had just met (van Henrichs or Kendrichs, no meaningful traces.) She talked to LOGINOV on and off for an hour. After an exchange of amenities she remarked that he spoke good English. He said it needed improvement and asked if she would be willing to give him lessons. She would like to but must leave in a week. He asked if she had any American friends who could teach him. She explained that she had friends when she lived in Mexico from 1954 to

1956 but they are all gone now. However she offered to make inquiries and suggested that he go to the American Embassy to find a teacher. He answered that both the American Ambassy and his own would frown on the idea and would not think well of it. Later she asked what he would do with his English onco he had learned it. He answered that he would like to go to the United States. What would your government think of that? He answered, "hell we all have to better ourselves". During this discussion he got the story of her life including the fact that she has written a book which is still in manuscript (see below). Ho expressed interest and asked to read it. She said she had a copy and he asked hor to drop it off at his embassy. He also said that he doesn't like Mexicans but pre- fers the company of Americans who are more like Russians. Upon parting it was agreed that she would drop by his embassy to give him the manuscript.

b. Two days later she dropped by his embassy and he talked to her in the outside reception area. She left him the manuscript and told him that he could keep it until she returned to Mexico. He gave her his card. Ho told her that she shouldn't call him because his phone was always tapped (she assumed he meant it was tapped by his own people). He added that he supposed the same thing happened at the American Abassy and asked, if she went there often. She answered that she had only been there twice in her life. He again inquired about her American friends in Mexico and she answered that she had no current ones. He again said he would like to meet Americans and asked her again to look for an American who could teach him English. On parting he said he would call her before she left (he knew that she was leaving in a few days to take care of her sick mother).

c. He called a day or so later and came over at ca 10:00 to Dr. MARIN's house where she was staying (not on LIENVOY). Họ asked when she would be back and how could he contact her in the United States. She gave him her mailing address and promised to answer if he wrote. He again asked her to find him an English teacher. She asked him, if he ever thought of going to the United States. Smiling, he answered, "Yes, who doesn't dream of going." He added that he can't go anywhere until he learns the language. She asked, if he would like to make a change. He answered that he has to be careful because he has a mother and family in the USSR. (From this Subject inferred that he would like to change and is only afraid of penalizing his family). He left on the note that she would try to find him a teacher and would contact him upon her return to Mexico.

d. Subject and Dr. MARIN agreed that LOGINOV was a fine person and thes should holp him get a teacher. Dr. MARIN suggested that Subject go to the American Embassy since they give English classes.

(Comment: Mexicans still commonly believe that the Mexican - North American Cultural Institute is part of the Embassy). Therefore Subject went to the Embassy on the morning of 16 December and was referred to a Mexican girl on the second floor (USIS). Subject told this girl her story and received the names of several teachors at the Institute. As she was leaving she thought that the Embassy would be interested in her story and thus fell into the hands of the political officer. She then went back to the Soviet Embassy but LOGINOV was not in so she left the list of teachers with the guard for him. She left Mexico the next day, 17 December.

4. LILYRIC photo coverage shows that Subject was at the Soviet Embassy from 13:35 to 13:42 on 16 November (after leaving the American Embassy). She arrived and departed in a taxi. LILYRIC also reports that LOGINOV was out from 13:14 to 13:52 on that date which confiras Subject's statement that he was not there. LILYRIC photo coverage also shows that Subject visited the Soviet Embassy from 11:20 to 11:54 on 10 November 1967, arriving and departing by taxi, (her first visit to the Embassy). Again, LILYRIC has LOGINOV in the Embassy from 09:07 to 13:45 on that date, thus confirming that Subject actually did see him. Thus her first meeting with LOGINOV at the party was probably on 6 or 8 November 1967. On 7 November LOGINOV was at the reception in the Embassy. LIENVOY has no information on a social engagement for LOGINOV at this time.

5. From her account it was obvious that she was extremely impressed with LOGINOV both physically ("he is such a handsome man") and as a person. From her conversations she concluded that he liked Americans and was interested in mesting them, that he is really interested in learning English so that he can go to the United States and that, somehow, he didn't want his own people to know about these interests and intentions. In fact, LOGINOV, did a fine job in de- briefing her and in keeping the contact open. This type of activity has become standard for him in Mexico.

6. Although the subject of his marital status never came up, Subject assumes that LOGINOV is single. "He acts like a single man". He loves parties and dancing and sports. (Again, standard behavior for him.)

7. BIOGRAPHIC DATA:

Elizabeth Duncan WILDE was born Elizabeth DUNCAN on 28 December 1918 in Tallahasse, Florida. Her parents were prosperous farmers outside Tallahassee who lost everything in the depression. They then moved to Toledo where her father and brothers gradually built up a successful construction business. Her father died about 10 years ago. Her mother is 81 and is expected to live two or three months. In 1942 she married Elliot H. JACKSON in Dallas, Texas.

They were divorced 4 years later. In 1946 she married William P.
STORY III in California. They divorced in 1948. In 1954 she came
to Mexico and opened the Scientific Institute for the Correction of
Obesity located at Reforma 376. At this time she met and became
friends of Dr. MARIN and his wife. On 11 December 1950 she married
Russel H. WILDE in Norwalk, Conn. They have been separated for seven
years. WILDE who is 15 years hor senior was for 37 years a member of
the New York law firm, Paul, Woiss, Rifkin, Wharton and Garrison.
He left this firm 4 years ago and now is associated with the firm
Shelleck, at 485 Madison Ave. He lives at the Yale Club in NYC. In
1957 she sold her institute to her employers. She has been in and
Hout of Mexico ever since, always staying with Dr. MARIN. She also-
travels regularly to Europe. Hor current address is 2024 Now Bedford
Rd., Spring Lake, N.J. Telephone 449-4230 (unlisted). She is cur-
rently living with and caring for her mother at 2829 North Kendale
Dr., Apt. 101, Toledo, Ohio. Telephono 419-474-0348. She has no
children. She has a generous allowance from her current husband.

## 8. ASSESSMENT:

Subject was obviously a very handsome woman who appears to
have spent her better years running through a series of wealthy
husbands and lovers. As noted above, she is extremely self-centered
and is uninterested in other people as people. Thus she is a poor
observer and reporter. She has a "bug" on Jews and Negrees. She
went into great detail on how American "ZIONISTS" control all the
information media in the United States and even influence government
policy. This is a "conspiracy" which is currently engaged in sup-
porting the Negro movement, especially moving into white housing..
This is the subject of her book, noted above. She has also had 4
accidents in the last four years (two fires in her home and two
automobilo accidents) which she considers a plot against her. She
suspects an old, vindictive lover from whom she broke when she dis-
covered that he was a Jew. Although Subject is not nearly as bad as
the above distillation would suggest, she is slightly unstable. Sho
is very much interested in helping us against LOGINOV and stated
several times that she would cooperate, completely. She is clearly not
suitable for a long-term or complicated relationship with LOGINOV but
could be used on a short term basis to introduce another person or
to be an instrument in a provocation.

## 9.

At the conclusion of the interview, Subject was told that,
although she had every reason to interpret events as she did, LOGINOV
specializes in contacting and developing Americans as he did her.
From her story, there was no reason to believe that he was displaying
vulnerabilities. Therefore we have no reason for her to attempt to
prolong the relationship or cultivate him. On the other hand she has
to contact him in order to get back her manuscript. She is not to
suggest further contact but is to report to us any further contact

initiated by LOGINOV. Onviously disappointed, Subject agreed to obey instructions. After she has reobtained the manuscript she is to call the Station (x870, Eetty calling for Bill Smith) and set a time for the meeting "at the house" (Dr. MARIN's) or at "the Cafe" (Cafe M sissippi). Subject expects to return to Mexicó sometime in the spring of 1968.

10. Dr. Frederico MARIN is Subject's host in Mexico. He is a pediatrician who owns a hospital or sanitorium (name and location unknown) in Mexico City. He served as a medical officer with the U.S. Army in World War II. Subject first met him and his wife in 1954 when she opened her institute. Thoy have been close friends over since. His wife died a year ago. She gave his address as Rio Duero 54, telephone 11-63-60 (no Station traces but checks out in the telephone book). She made me promise that I would not contact him because, as a Mexican, he wouldn't want to get involved between Soviete and Americans. However, when Subject returns we intend to meet him through her to investigate his possible usefulness and as a means of further assessment of subject.

11. PLANS:

Debrief Subject after her next contact with LOGINOV and meet and assess Dr. MARIN for possible use.

PROGRESS REPORT

1. This report covers the activities of LIROCKET-1 in the period 1 August to 8 December 1957. During this period, with the exception of a summer lreul., LIROCKET-1 maintained his role as a teacher at the Soviet Intaury. In an effort to susaarize the more salient occurrences during this period, wo have endeavored to present it, as far as possible, in s chronological manuer under the name of the individual to whom the material is related.

2. Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSKV (201-038975). Cn1 August, KAZANTSEV verbally admonished Vladimir Hasimovich GONCHARENKO (201-760865) for arriving at this class some 15 minutes late and for having neglected to pay LILCCKET-l on this date. KAZANTSEV, quipped to LIROCKET-1 that "these young men are becoming more irresponsible." Pavel Fedorovich KOVALA told LIROCKET-1 that he was preparing Invitations for the departure of one of LIROCKNT-l's previous students and that he would put one aside for LIROCKET-1. KAZANTSEV interrupted and stated, "I's inviting the teacher and I will give him the invitation." KOVALI made no further comment on the subject. Later, when alone, KAZANTSLV told LIROCKET-l that he was the "number two man lo the Soviet Esbarty" even though he holds the number three position. He referred to timself as the Charge d'Affaires. This was the first time that KAZANTSEV had ever spoken of his rank or positión to LIROCKET-1.

3. On 17 August KAZANTSEV studied for one hour with LIROCKET 1. LIROCKET-1 commented that BAZANTSEV's level of fluency exceeded all of his other students. According to KAZANTSKY, upon his return home in June, he was required to take his English language examination and scored a final mark of 4.5 out of a possible 5. KAZANTSEV lost the 1/2 point only because he had not read any English language books during the previous months.

4. On 24 August, KAZANTSEV stated that his wife had been having stomach trouble of a undisclosed origin. She had just returned from the hospital where she underwent tests to determine the nature of her illness.

5. During the class of 29 August, KAZANTSEV read an article in the English language newspaper, *The Nova*, portsining to the diminuition of the male sex drive among heavy smokere. This triggered a long monologue by KAZANTSEV on the evils of pornographic literature. KAZANTSEV found this aspect of watern society distasteful and serving no useful purpose.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 272

6. On 31 August, KAZANTSAV told LIFOCKAT-1 that Semen
   Tarasovich BAZAROV (201-049257) was again interested in taking
   English lessons from LIROCKET-1. LIROCKET-1 commented that he
   might be able to accomodate BAZAROV only from mid-September to the
   end of November. KAZANTSIV left the room and contacted BAZAROV.
   Upon returning KAZANTSEV stated that BAZAROV would have pressing
   obligations in connection with the forthcoming anniversary and
   Olympics and could not begin classes until sometime thereafter.

7. On September, KAZANTSEV commented that he would like to
   continue studying English because be expected to return PCS to his
   country at the end of 1967 or early 1968. KAZANTSSV acknowledged
   that he might be asked to stay on during the Olympics. However, he
   indicated that this was unlikely to prevent hia froa returning.
   KAZANTSAV reiterated his desire to depart Mexico in the near future.

8. On 10 October, KAZANTSEV received several pocket books in
   English which he had requested LIROCKET-1 to pick out for him.
   LIROCKET-1 selected then from his own library. KAKANTSEV stated that
   he did not care what subjects were chosen; he wanted them only to
   improve his reading ability. He did mention, however, that he prefer-
   red not to read books which had either violence or pornography as
   their central theme. LIROCKET-1 brought a book on science fiction
   which did not particularly interest KAZANTSEV, a book on ballet, and
   a book on the FBI in which KAZANTSEV Booned very interested. KAZANTSEV
   stated that he would have to discontinue all of his classes from 10
   October to 16 November as he was scheduled for vacation during this
   period.

9. On 16 November, KAGANTSEV interrupted a class containing
   Vladimir Maksimovich GONCLAJENKO (201-760865) and Yevgeniy Ivanovich
   BEDRIN (201-760220) to announce that he would not study that day.
   Imediately, BEDRIN wheeled around and told KAZANTSEV very explicitly
   that he should remain and study. To this KAZANTSKY replied in English,
   "See the pressure my chief puts on me". It was quite apparent to
   LIROCKET-1 that BEDRIN was in charge of the language lessons and that
   KAZANTSEV was seemingly very hositant to defy BEDRIN's challenge.
   KAZANTSEV stated that he hid wanted to take a weeks leave, but in
   deference to BEDRIN's wisica, KAZANTSEV remained during the rest of
   the class, although his presence was somewhat of a disruptive factor.
   Later during the class, LILOCKET-1 bad KAZANTSEV and BEDRIN ask each
   other questions in English - an exercise which KAZANTSEV enjoyed in
   that his English is superior to BEDRIN's. However, BEDRIN rose to the
   occasion, comported himseli in a fine manner, and there ensued a
   lively exchange of questions and answers on non-controversial topics.

10. GONCHARENKO was absent from class from 10 August to 19
    September. During this period he was on home leave.

11. On 19 September GONCHARENKO returned to class and LIROCKET-1
    complimented his on his laproved Naglish facility. CONCHARENΚΟ
    stated that he had worked diligently on hid English during this summer
    vacation. During the period 19 September to 7 December, GONCHARENKO
    did not attend classes regularly.

12. CEDRIN was absent from class from 10 August to 19 September. During this period he was on home leave.

13. On 19 September, BADRIN returned to class and commented that he had not looked at his Diglish lessons since August. BEDRIN related that he had spent most of his vacation in the Leningrad area which is his home as well as his wife's.

14. On 21 September the subject of conversation turned to alcoholic beverages. BEDRIN stated that he couldn't drink vodka like he used to as it gives him too much of a hangover the following day. BEDRIN stated that he preferred whisky (Canadian Club and Seagrams) to any other drink.

15. During the classroom discussion of books on 10 October, LIROCKET-1 noted that BEDRIN has somewhat of an obsession with books ofa pornographic nature. BEDRIN had previously remarked to LIROCKET-1 that he enjoys a good spicy story and that during a 1966 layover in Brussels, he sought out and enjoyed viewing a number of sex movies.

16. On 12 October, LIROCKET-1 commented that he wight visit the States during the last of October. BEDRIN, privately, asked LIROCKET-1 to purchase for him two 7 inch reel recording tapes and two 8 inch reel tapes. BEDRIN said that "another friend" had brought him some tapes in the past. This was the first time BADR IN had ever requested LIROCKET-1 to perform any personal favor. On 31 October BKDRIN canceled the order relating that he did not need the requested tapes inasmuch as a "friend" had purchased sons Grundig tapes for him while in the US.

17. On 16 November, HEDRIN strongly advired KAZANTSEY to remain for his class rather than skipping it. (See KAZANTSEV, 16 November incident).

18. Valentin Mikhaylovich KORNYUKHIN (201-274727) began classes on 21 November, in the company of KAZANTJEV. KORN YUKHIN possesses good, fluent English although his grammar is somewhat unpolished. He speaks with a decidedly British accont. KORNYUKHIN stated that he had been in Mexico for approximately five months and had served previously in Burma from approximately 1962-65. After his assignment in Burna, KORNYUKHIN had worked in Moscow (1965-67). KORNYUKHIN appears to be between 35 and 40 years of age, blonde hair, trim, athletic appearing approximately & feet tall and weighing between 165-170 pounds.

19. On 23 November, KAZANTSEV and KORNYUKEIN studied together. During the lesson a slight difference of opinion arose between the two over what their goverinent's position was during the 1964 Cyprus crisis. The exchange reflected the obdurate, somewhat dogmatic character of KORNYUKHIN. IROCKET-1 characterized KORNYUKHIN as

FORET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 274

# SECRET

possessing very strong and Sixed ideas. KORNYUKHIN did not appear to be awed by KAZANTSEV's official position and spoke openly and forcefully to him.

20. On 29 November, during the course of a discussion, KAZANTSEV and KORNYUKHIN again became embroiled in an animated debate. KORNYUKHIN debated KAZANTUEV in an effective and energetic manner. seemingly unafraid of correcting or disputing KAZANTSEV. The argument was not personal nor was there any apparent evidence of rancor between the two.

21. On 7 December, KORUYUKLIN studied along with LIROCKET-1. LIROCKAT-1 soon discovered that KORNYUKHIN was somewhat of a chameleon in his personality in that he was completely difference without the presence of KAZANTSEV. KORUYUKHIN manifested a friendly, affable, and responsive manner, gratefully accepting any criticism from LIROCKET-1 regarding his use of the language and giving up all pretensions of being a hard-nosed personality. LIROCKET-1 garnered the impression that KORNYUKIHIN wants to be liked and that his character ambivalence may be a front in order to impress KAZANTSEV. During their conversation; KORN YUKHIN commented that he was having some difficulty in adjusting to Mexico and its weather. In discussing India, KORN YUKH IN. stated that India was better off than China, but that the Indians vere unmanageable, unorganised, and uncontrollable. KORNYUKHIN stated that he was more impressed with Burma then either India or Mexico.

## MISCELLANEOUS

22. During the 28 September class, LIBOCKAT-1 was sought out by Yevgeniy Nikolayevich GORLITSYN (201-773422) who began taling to LIROCKET-1 in fairly adequate English, capable of making a conversation. GORLITSYN commsented that he preferred to study his English Blong rather than in a clase with a tutor. GORLITSYN also stated that he would be required to take his Anglish exam in the near future and that he would hermetically seal himself off for one week while he prepared for it. GORLITSYN stated that he wanted "to maintain his 20% bonus" by passing the glich exam. LIROCKLT-1 views GORLITSYN as somewhat of a bumpkin; not particularly intelligent, but a plodder. He appears to be a loner in his relationships with others of the same nationality.

23. During this same class, Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412) spoke briefly with LIBUCKET-1. LOGINOY asked LIROCKET-1 11 he would have time to teach English to his eight year old son. LIROCKAT-1 stated that the hours requested by LOGINOV for lessona would be impossible to accommodate. LOGINCY then began talking of his love for sports and his background as a former Judge in Olympic skiing as well as refering to various other sports including tennis. LOGINOV's English is good, although not as fluent as KAZANTSEV's. LOGINOV's problem seems to be & lack of practice. LIROCKET-1 characterized LOGINOV as a highly perceptive individual with a keen sense of intelligence.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 275

FUTURE PLANNING

24. Future planning: LIROCKET-1 will continue to teach at the Soviet Sabassy, Mexico two days per week for a total of five bours. His work appears to be quite satisiactory and he is apparently well regarded as a teacher by the Soviet Ambassy.. LIROCKET-1 assesses KORNYUICHIN as the most interesting pupil with whom he is in contact and, accordingly, intends to concentrate his efforts toward establishing a social rapport with NORNYUKHIN which will lead to an exchange of visits. LIROCKET-1 has been given several Personality Assessment Questionnaires for use in recording observable behavioral patterus in his students.

Nikolay Daitriyevich CHERNYSHKY, Repatriate from Venezuela

1.  According to LIENVOY on 4 September 1967, Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412), Consul of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City placed a call to Havana, Cuba stating that he had in Mexico a family of 5 persons that had to be sent from Cuba to Odessa by boat. LOGINOV said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had ordered that their passage be paid to the border of the USSR. The family name was given as CHERKYSHEV. According to LOGINOV the family had been given permission to live in Groznyy in the USSR by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

2.  On 7 September 1967, LICOZY-5 reported that LOGINOV had booked passage to Cuba for a Russian emigre, Nikolay CHERNYSHEV and his family. CHERNYSEV's wife was born in Italy and his three children Igor, Nataliya and Sergey were all born in Venezuela. LOGINOV also stated to LICUZY-5 that the CHERNYSHEVs sere repatriates from Venezuela.

3.  Plans to send the CHERNYSHEV family to the USSR via Cuba were apparently changed because LIFIRE reported their departure for the USSR via Montreal via Canadian Pacific Airlines Flight 582 on 28 September 1967. The following information on the CHERRYSHEV family was available from the LIFIRE report:

THE CONSULAR SECTION OF THE USSR EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY

The consular section consists of three persons:

Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV - consul (third secretary) 261-285412

Vladislav Sergeyovich KORMUSHKIN - vice consul (Attache:261-744341)

Vladimir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH - vice consul (third secretary)

with such a seeming-scarcity of work for the Congulate,
it would be sufficient to have only one man forit. But the
Soviet Embassy has to have three men handling consular duties.
The Consulate is open to visitors twice a week and only two
hours a day. Even that is too much for an occasional person
who desires a visa for visiting the USSR. However, in addi-
tion to their regular duties, the consuls have to arrange
various matters relating to visiting Soviet cargo vessels,
artistic and cultural groups, etc. On several occasions,
they had to do and errands outside of their overt field of
activity. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why, in many
instances, they cannot be reached on the telephone. All
three of them speak fluent Spanish and have no difficulty in
getting around and acquiring Mexican friends. Given below
are their respective character sketches.

Consul LOGINOV is a rather recent arrival (two years in
Mexico) and not very experienced in his job. However, he is
learning the ropes quite rapidly and carries a lot of weight
among the Embassy staff. LOGINOV is the one who orders cars

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 289

to be sent for any visiting dignitary or a porformor. He, apparently, scrutinizes and approves the names of doctors and dontists patronized by the Embassy-personnol. Recently a Man on Duty said over the phors that LOGINOV had forbidden to be givon out the address of a German dontist, whom the Soviets visited quite frequently beforo.

LOGINOV is also in charge of making up a duty rostor for appointing a Man on Duty who would bo rosponsible for anything that took place at the Embassy on that particular day. so one, oxcept the ambassador, seems to bo exempt from that duty. On a few occasions LOGINOV encountered hostility το hic arbitrary manner of making up the duty roster. Thus, when a Kan on Duty called Nikolay Scrgoyovich LECHOV, Press Attache and a (former?) Cultural Officer, and told him that LOGINOV put his name down as the pesponsible Man on Duty for the Embassy for that day, LEONOV said that họ was very busy and lot LOGINOV do it himself.

Obviously LOGINOV had made a number of secret enemies with his dictutorial manners and his disdainful, monotonous,. and slow way of talking. His medium- to high-pitched voice sounds as if he is extremely bored with the world and aoes his inter locutor a favor just be talking το him.

Fis physical appearance seems to confirm that impression A fou newspaper photos show him as a youngish ana rathor good-looking indiviqual with curly light-brom hair and with


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 290

a contmptuous smile on his lips. Unquestionably, his type
of charm appeals to slderly ladies and LOGIROV is quite aware
that he is attractive to the other sex. Without a doubt, he
trios to capitalize on it and with his fluent Spanish probe
ably tries to ensnare Mexican remales. Thereis no indica-
tion that LOOTNOV has tried anything of the sort with the
Soviot wives. One of the reasons may be that he would not
liko his wire, Aleksanara mitriyeva, a very formidable woman
Indeed, to get wind of it. On the other hand, the Mexican
women may seem to be more exotic and attractive to LOGINOV
than his own countrywomen, in ospecial his wife, who is a
large unattractive Female.

Nevertheless, LOGINOVA seems to be quite pleasant, with
a nice cultured voice, and gets along with her husband well
thanks to her good humeur and social activity. She has
been quite prominent in Nestkom work and in the children's.
summer camp. Eft Shortly after their arrival, LOGINOV bought
a tape-recorder for his wife for 115 collars. Whether it
was to be used for music, or other purposes, has not been
determined.

Once in a while, LOGIKOV goes on drunken sprees. Thus,
on 12 February 1966, he and KORMUSHKIN drove us to
the Imbassy gate at three a..., pounded on the gate, blow
their horn and had altercations with Stanislav sergeyevich
SILATROV, who was en duty at that time.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 291

Another very prominent trait of LOGINOV'S character is his extreme chauvinism, bordering on jingoism. In reference to other nationalities, LOGINOV use's such deprecatorý epixxx thets as: "Amerikashki", "Zhidovka", "Namehura", etc.

It is doubtrul if LOGINOV has any true friends. His sneering attitude is probably the reason for it. Although he made jovoral errors in judgement in his work and cocial behaviour, LOGINOV by no means is a fool and should be kept in mind for any possible developments.

Vladislav Sergeyovich KORMUSHKIN, vice consul (Attaché), is a young man about thirty-three years of age, whten rather stocky, with blond wavy hair over a high forehead. A pair of heavy-rimmed glassos gives him the appearance of a very intellectual porson. On the whole, KORMUSHKIN has the air- of an eayy-going fellow, who can make friends almost over- night. KORMUSHKIN and his wife are exceptionally close friends with Anatoliy Vladimirovich KARABACE, employee of the Comercial Office, and his wife. Both families visit cach other quite frequently.

Besides occasional drinking bouts, KORMUSHKIN has not been known to practice any skirt-chasing, since his wife, Inca Nikolayevna, is not a bad-looking women herself, and both seem to be getting along smoothly. KORMUSKINA is a practicing physician at the Embassy and is quite in demand

whenever any of the Soviets or his family is ill. KORNUS-
EXIN is also quite active in consular affairs and does most
of the leg work for LOGINOV. He is also very activo in
Kestkon functions, where he is in charge of the Childron's
section. KORFUSEXIN is quite an armatim energetic and
pushy individual and can be quite rude and nasty at timos.
Undoubtedly, he is looking forward to boing a full-fledged
consul in time to come. The impression of KORMUSEKIN'S am-
bition and pushy treit in his character is intensified by tho
sound of his rapid and energetic but pleasant baritone voico.

A curious fact should be cited here. Shortly after his
arrival, KORKUSHKIN purchased a tape-recorder for 185 dollars.
or 70 dollars more than the one bought by his "boss" LOGINOV.
my?

It seems that in the future, NORMUSHKIN may slow down
somewhat, but his inner drive and energy will nevertheloss
make him a more adroit and skillful individual. His further
progress should be watched with interest and caution.

Vladimir Ivanovich SHPAKOVIC, vice-consul (third secre-
tary) seems to be able to handle any job that cores along.
Previously he was mentioned as an assistant Cultural Attache,
then substituted for the Press Attechs, while that position
remained vacant, and quite recently, while the two consuls
are on leave, he has started calling himself "consul".

SHPAKEVICH is of very ordinary appearance, of slight build and dark complexion and is unmarked by any outstanding features, with the exception of a noticeably receding hairline. He wears glasses sometimes. His voice is even plainer than his looks. It has the unusual chamelconic peculiarity of sounding like someone else's. Even SHPAKEVICH'S closest friends cannot recognize his voice at times and he delights in taking advantage of it. Occasionally SHPAKEVICH would call a friend on the phone and start talking in rapid Spanish. When the friend is duly confused and does not know what to say, SHPAKEVICH breaks into an explosive guffaw that somehow lacks true merriment. Since SHPAKEVICH repeats this crude joke time after time it is obvious that his sense of humour is quite rudimentary.

Ordinarily SHPAKEVICH is a cautious individual who dislikes making decisions of importance. He said that he was getting clobbered whenever a decision was wrong. However, SHPAKEVICH can be quite importunate at the wrong moment and with the wrong person. Thus, when attached to the dancer, PLISETSKAYA'S group as an interpreter in Puebla, SHPAKEVICH called the Embassy about some trivial matter and wanted to talk to ambassador BAZAROV. A Man on Duty told him that BAZAROV was taking his mid-afternoon rest and was not to be bothered. But SHPAKEVICH persisted in his desire to talk to BAZAROV. Finally BAZAROV took the phone and when he


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 294

-7-

found out what SHPAKEVICH wanted to tell him, BAZAROV gave
him a verbal lashing that actually sizzled. Nevertheless,
later SHPAKEVICH called again and asked for the ambassador.
The Man on Duty, Ivan Fedorovich SOLOMATIN, told SHPAKEVICH,
"Ah, he roasted you and me before for *** disturbing his
rest and now you want some more of it?" But SHPAKEVICH was
not to be put off and SOLOMATIK with a sigh buzzed BAZAROV
again. At first BAZAROV was angry but later calmed-down and
discussed with SHPAKEVICH the well-being of PLISETSKAYA and
her group. The above incidnet may chabacterize SHPAKEVICH
in American vernacular as a "pest" and a "jerk". Both ex-
pressions describe his true nature quite well.

It is doubtful if this one-time assistant of the cul-
tural attache had any extensive schooling. Such inadmissible
expressions as, for instande, "Ya khochu dolozhitsya" is a
clear indication of his low educational level.

But with all his shortcomings, SHPAKEVICH is probably
well liked by the majority of the Soviets. He is easy to
get along with, especially with his friends. His closest
friends are the families of the Soviet correspondents, the
KUDRIAKOVS and the DOLGOVS, and he is also very intimate with
Leonia Vasilyevich (Losnka) NIKIFOROV, Intourist representa-
tive. On a few occasions both of them get together with
the aim of draining a bottle of cognac. However, there was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 295

-8-

No indication that SHPAKEVICH was ever riotous or dead drunk. He is neither a skirt-chaser, although with his fluent Spanish and a human tank for a wife, SHPAKEVICH would be justified in investigating gresnor pastures among the Mexican women. But he is decidedly devoid of any imagination.

Despite her great bulk, SHPAKEVICH'S wife, Tatyana Ivanovna, seems to be a very amiable person and all the Soviet wives agree that she is very "nice". Tatyana is two years SHPAKEVICH'S junior, but she acts like a protective mother-hen towards him. She has high blood pressure and that was probably why she left for Moscow over a month ago. Consequently SHPAKEVICH is here all by himself for the present and some of his friends, who refer to him simply as "SHPAK", invite him occasionally for dinner or lunch.

Yet SHAPKEVICH can also hurt some people's feelings with his callous indifference. Once, when Nina Atanasyevna NIKITINA, wife of the films representative, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, begged SHPAKEVICH to drive her home from the Embassy, since she was dead tired after running errands for the Nestkon, SHPAKEVICH told her in an indifferent manner that he had no desire to do so and walked away. NIKITINA was so hurt by SHPAKEVICH'S attitude that she cried in the street on her way home. Acts of this nature cannot endear him to some people and by all indications, SHPAKEVICH does not seem


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 296

to be a vory bright individual. Thuc, he is doing used for
any conceivable job that prosents itself, but only in tho cap-
acity of a tomporary stop-gap, as an interpreter, or even as
an errand-boy.

LIROEBIN-1 and -2 Progress Report, November 1966 - July 1967

1. The Station continued to maintain contact with the LIROBBINS during the reporting period for the dual purpose of monitoring their relations with the Soviets and using them as sources of information on their heterogeneous social circle. Dwindling contact between the Soviets and the LIROBBINS since March suggests, however, that the Soviets may have lost their earlier interest in the couple.

2. LIROBBIN-1 and -2 had the following contact with the Soviets during the reporting period:

7 November: LIROBBIN-1 and 2 attended the 7 November Soviet Embassy celebration at the invitation of Aleksandr V. PRIKHODKO (201-202739).

20 November: LIROBBIN-1 and 2 attended a Soviet film showing at the Foreign Press Club put on by PRIKIODKO and Vladimir A. DOLGOV (201-763035).

24 November: LIROBBIN-1 and 2 and PRIKHODKO were among the guests at a Thanksgiving dinner given by Pearl GONZALEZ.

1 December: LIROBBIN-1 bumped into PRIKHODKO in a coffee shop in the vicinity of several boys' schools. PRIKHODKO appeared to be deeply engaged in conversation with an unidentified Mexican boy who appeared to be about 20 years old and a student. PRIRHODKO greeted LIROBBIN-1, but neither introduced the boy nor asked LIROBBIN-1 to join them. PRIKHODKO vas still talking with the boy when LIROBBIN-1 left.

Early December: At the invitation of PRIKHODKO and Valentin I. KUCHKOV (201-758017),
LIBOBBIN-1 and -2 attended a reception in honor of the Bolshoi Ballet at the Soviet Embassy.

3 February: LIROBBIN-1 and -3 and their daughter attended a dinner and film shoving at the Soviet films office along with another American couple the LIROBBING bad intro duced to PRIKHODKO. PRIEHODKO and BUCHEROV were the hosts.

15 February: LIROBBIN-1 and -2 set Valentin 8. LOGINOV (201-285412), for the first time, at an Indian Embassy reception.

16 February: At LOGINOV's invitation, LIROBBIN-2 at- tended a Consular Corps gathering at the Soviet Dabassy. LIBOBBIN-1 had left for the United States that morning. PRIKHODKO and KUCHEROV both appeared genuinely sur prised at seeing LIROBBIN-2 and learning that she knew LOGOV. LOGINOV, for his part, also seemed surprised that PRIKHODKO and KUCHAROV knew LIROBBIN-2.

17 February: KUCHAROV came over to LIROHSIN-2's apart- meut during the afternoon with an invi- tation to the Soviet Army Day reception which he had promised on lu February to deliver personally. AS KUCHAROV know, LIROBAIN-1 had left for the U.S. KUCHEROV invited hizself in Zor several drinks and stayed for two hours talking about nothing. At one point he noticed a scratch on LIROBBIN-2's knee and used the opportunity to administer a sympathetic caress which wound up going down the length of ber leg. He did not attempt to follow up this amorous gambit, however, and finally left with nothing more than a good-by bear hug.

23 February: LIROBBIN-2 attended the Soviet Army Day Reception at the Soviet Embassy, where she talked primarily with PRIKECOKO, RUCHEROV, and DOLGOV. She also spoke briefly with LOGINOV, who invited her to go along on a Consular Corps tour of the Mexican Home Show.

3 Harch:
LIROBDIN-2 went on the tour of the Hoar Show, during which she talked with LOGINOV for about 35 ainutes.

31 March:

LIROBBIN-2 telephoned PRIKHODKO about a week in advance and invited him to dinner on this date. He accepted, but failed to show up and never called to apologize.

12 July:

LIROBBIN-3 met LOGINOV at an Indian Embassy reception. During a brief conversation with him he told her he was about to leave for the USSR on vacation and that PRIKHODKO would be doing the same later in the month:

3. As can be seen from the above run down, none of the LIROBBINS' Soviet contacts have made any effort to see them since early March, and PRIKHODKO even missed a dinner party without so much as calling to apologize. It therefore appears that the LIROBBINS have at least temporarily been put on the shelf by the Soviets, if not dropped altogether. We expect to get a more definite reading in the fall, when the large number of Soviets now on vacation, including PRIKHODKO and LOGINOV, have returned and the Soviets have resumed their normal routines.

4. In the course of the reporting period, the LIROBBINS also provided information on 14 non-Soviet acquaintances of interest to the Station.

REDTOP/AETARGET/LIROCKET-1 -Gatehouse and Outside Reception Roon and offices at Soviet Embassy/Control of Routine Visitors to the Embassy during Business Hours

REFERENCE: HMMA-30795, 8 December 1966

1. Transmitted herewith are copies of (a) a sketch of the interior of the gatehouse just inside the front gate of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City and (b) a sketch of the interior of the Reception Room and offices adjoining the gatehouse. Both sketches were prepared by LIROCKET-1 and are current as of May 1967. LIROCKE-1 has been in the Reception Room approximately 55 times, the gatehouse about 15 times, and the first office twice.

2. Control of Routine Visitors to the Embassy during Business Hours. According to LIROCKET-1, traffic through the front foot gate is essentially controlled by a single guard whe operates the gate latch electronically by means of a release button inside the gatehouse. In the course of approximately 125 visits to the Soviet Embassy from January 1966 to the present, LIROCKET-1 on occasion has seen as many as three guards in the gatehouse at one time, but there has usually been only one guard present when he has entered and exited the gate (usually about 0915 and 1145, respectively, on Mondays and Fridays prior to mid-January 1967, and about 1530 and 1800 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from mid-January to mid-May 1957). Even when more than one guard has been present, it has appeared that only one of the guards has actually been on duty and that the others have simply been lounging in the gatehouse for want of anything better to do. LIROCIT-i has never seen any of the guards carry arms and has never seen weapons of any kind in the gatehouse. He has seen the following live persons on guard

duty (identified from mug shots): Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN (201-782164), Valentina Georgiyevna MUKHINA, wife of Anatoliy Aleksandrovich MUKHIN (201-293944), Stanislav Sergeyevich SILNIKOV (201-271103), Ivan Fedorovich SOLOMATIN (201-307933), and Nikolay Ivanovich ZAKHAROV (201-779288).

3. To gain entry through the foot gate, the would-be visitor presses the white doorbell button to the left of the foot gate. This button rings a buzzer inside the gatehouse. The guard on duty promptly looks through the observation window which directly faces the footgate. If, presumably, the guard is satisfied that the caller or callers do not look dangerous or suspicious, he disengages the gate latch electronically by pressing one of the two release buttons inside the gatehouse. After the gate latch disengages, it is up to the caller to push (or, when the caller is leaving, pull) the gate open and then close it behind him. The gate locks automatically when closed. According to LIROCKET-1, there is a keyhole on the inside of the gate, but there definitely is no keyhole on the outside. LIROCKET-1 has never seen anyone open the gate with a key.

4. LIROCKET-1 has been present in only about five instances when non-Soviets in vehicles have sought admittance through the vehicle gate, which is adjacent to the foot gate. In each of the five instances, the callers have been delivery men whose trucks have apparently been recognized by the guard. In each instance, the truck has pulled up with its nose to the vehicle gate and. the guard has walked to the gate and opened it manually. The vehicle gate consists of two doors which open inward. It is secured by one dead bolt from one door to the other. LIROCKET-1 has never noticed a padlock on the gate. After being admitted to the Embassy grounds, the trucks in each case have driven unaccompanied to and parked under the portecochere on the north side of the main Embassy building. After closing the gate, the guard has returned to the gatehouse, where although LIROCKET-1 has never actually observed a guard doing so he has evidently telephoned someone inside the main building to give notification of the truck's arrival.

5. LIROCKET-1 has been present përhaps 25 times when pedestrian callers (delivery men, students, persons on visa business) have rung the foot gate buzzer, and in each instance the guard has routinely let them in without going to the gate to question them or observe them more closely. On one occasion, as many as four young Mexican males who appeared to be university students rang the buzzer while LIROCKET-1 was inside the gatehouse, and the guard let them in in the routine manner.

6. Once inside the gate, the pedestrian caller is expected to present himself at the gatehouse door, which is usually left open, and state his business. The guard then either goes next door to summon an Embassy official from one of the two offices oft the Reception Room, or, as in Subject's case, uses the interphone to call someone inside the main building. (In LIROCKET-1's case, the guard calls one of his Soviet students.) If instructed to have the caller wait, the guard shows him into the Reception Room. LIROCKET-1 himself has been asked to wait in the Reception Room about 55 times. On approximately 15 occasions, he has been invited into the gatehouse by the guard on duty to chat. On the latter occasions, he has either remained in the gatehouse until one of his Soviet students has appeared to escort him into the main building or has left the gatehouse after a few minutes and gone to the Reception Room to continue waiting for one of his students to arrive. On approximately 60 of LIROCKET-1's visits to the Embassy.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 310

the guard has been instructed by the person on the others of the interphone to show LIROCKET-1 to the classroom, (Except for two occasions, the Soviets have always used the first room, on the left, just inside the main entrance to the main building for Subject's classes.) When the guard does show LIROCKET-1 into the classroom, he leaves the gatehouse for between 1 and 3 minutes (depending on whether he opens the classroom windows). The guard has been alone in the gatehouse about half of the 60 times he has shown Subject into the classroom, and has consequently left the gatehouse unattended for 1-3 minutes on approximately 30 occasions.

7. Offices Off the Reception Room. There are two offices off the Reception Room. The first office is known from other sources to be used for visa interviews. The second office is presumably used for the same purpose. The first office opens directly into the Reception Room. The second office is at the back of the first office and is entered either through the first office or through an outside door. (LIROCKET-1 has never seen the outside door used, however.) One or both of the offices were occupied by Soviets about 20 of the roughly 40 times LIROCKET-1 was in the Reception Room prior to mid-January 1967 (usually on Monday and Friday mornings between 0915 and 0930). The Soviets frequently left the door to the first office, and somewhat less frequently to the second office, open when they were present. The first door or both doors were sometimes also left open when no Soviet was present. When the door to the first office or the doors to both offices were open and LIROCKET-1 sat opposite the door to the first office, he could see about a quarter of the interior of the first office and a small part of the interior of the second office. Although official Soviet visa hours are only on Tuesdays and Fridays (from 1100-1300), LIROCKET-1 saw Soviets in both offices with about equal frequency on Monday and Friday mornings. From what LIROCKET-1 could see, the Soviets rarely seemed to be busy with desk work, but confined themselves to looking over newspapers, opening mail, chatting with each other, etc. Frequently Soviets went into one of the offices for just a moment and then left. Since LIROCKET-1 has begun going to the Embassy about 1530 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, however, he has always found the door to the first office shut and both offices evidently empty. (COMMENT: This is probably explained by the fact that the Embassy lunch break is from 1400-1600).

8. LIROCKET-1 recently had occasion to visit Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412), the Soviet Consul, in the first office from approximately 1830-1900 on a Thursday. At this time he found LOGINOV doing paper work and a stack of 30-35 passports on his desk. LIROCKET-1 also recently stepped into the first office to see LOGINOV at 1830 on a Tuesday, but LOGINOV was just leaving and LIROCKET-1 did not stay. LIROCKET-1 has never been inside the second office. His sketch of the second office is based on what he has been able to see from the Reception Room and the first office In order not to seem curious, he purposely did not look around the first office when he was in it and consequently does not know what kind of furnishings, if any, are on the far side of the first office!

9. From January 1966 to January 1967, LIROCKET-1 was in the Reception Room on 8-10 occasions when other non-Soviet visitors came in. The Soviet interviewer ushered the visitors into one of the offices and closed the door to the first office on about four of these occasions. On two occasions, the Soviet interviewer ushered the visitor into the first office and did not bother to close the door. On four or five occasions, the Soviet interviewer came out into the Reception Room to talk with me visitor in LIROCKET-1's presence. In each of the six or seven cases in which Subject was able to hear the conversation, the Soviet and the visitor were discussing visa matters.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 311

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

10. LIROCKET-1 estimated that while he was present in the Reception Room between January 1966 and January 1967, he observed Soviets in the first office about four times as often as in the second office. From mug shots, he identified the following Soviets as having been the primary users of the two offices during the times he was present:

(a) LOGINOV, one of the two Soviet Vice-Consuls until he became Consul in September 1966. LOGINOV is known KGB, LIROCKET-I frequently saw him in the first office and saw him receive several visitors.

(b) Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV (201-120123), Second Secretary and the Consul until September 1966. YATSKOV is known KGB. LIROCKET-I saw YATSKOV with about half the frequency of LOGINOV. YATSKOV used both offices. LIROCKET-1 also saw YATSKOV receive visitors.

(c) Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN (201-744341), Vice-Consul and probably KGB. LIROCKET-1 saw him walk in and out of the first office several times, but never saw him receive visitors.

(d) Ruslan Aleksandrovich TUCHNIN (201-205304), the Radio and TV correspondent and suspect GRU. LIROCKET-1 saw him in the second office two or three times, but never saw him receive a visitor.

SUBJECT: REDCOAT/ICIMPROVE/LICANNY-1 -- Status Report on LICANNY-1

REFERENCE: A. HMMA-30292, 11 October 1966

B. HMMW-14988, 4 November 1966

1. Subject was recruited in May 1963 to accept Soviet recruitment if approached during a visit to the USSR in May-June 1963. Following his return to Mexico, he reported that no offort had been made to recruit or, to his knowledge, cultivate or compromise him. The Station maintained sporadic contact with Subjoct between June 1963 and August 1964, during which time he furnished limited information on Soviet travelers to and from Mexico and on Soviet interest in increasing tourist traffic between Mexico and the USSR.

2. The Station was notified in August 1964 that Subject's POA had been cancelled. There was then no further contact with him until January 1966, although, during the latter part of 1965, Subject on his own initiative gave the LNPURE officer with whom he regularly dealt on visa matters information on Soviet visitors to Mexico, as well as on the visit of the Moscow Symphony to Mexico. The LNPURE officer passed this information on to the Station. In January 1966, Subject advised the LAPURE officer that he was in contact with Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV (201-120123) and Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412), both of whom had asked him for information on sea and rail travel between Mexico, New York, and Europe. At this time, the LNPURE officer turned Subject over to a new Station case officer who debriefed Subject and obtained his agreement to supply personality information on LOGINOV. Subject stipulated at this time, however, that he did not want to become involved in clandestine meetings or take money, and expressed the desire to meet the case officer in the INPURE officer's office following the conclusion of Subject's visa business.

The LNPURE officer also informed the case officer that Subject had previously mentioned that he had once been "approached" to supply information on Soviet travelers on a regular basis and had refused to do so. Subject evidently did not specifically say that he had been approached by WOFACT, but this was clearly the implication. Subject told the LNPURE officer that he was willing to supply informa- tion he considered unusual or especially interesting, but was not willing to supply information on a routine basis.

3. The Station had no contact with Subject between 6 January and 28 September 1966. On 20 September, the Station learned from LICOZY-5 that Subject had been invited along with several other Mexican travel agents to attend an Intourist conference in Moscow from 24-29 October. A meeting was consequently arranged with Subject for 28 September through the LNPURE officer.

4. Subject told the Station officer who met him that he had been meaning to contact the Station about his forthcoming trip, which, he said, he assumed was what the case officer wanted to talk about. He gave the case officer a copy of his invitation to the Intourist conference and on his own initiative offered to provide the Station with a full report of the conference when he returned. However, he stated that he was not interested in working for the Station on a permanent, "agent" basis, in meeting under clandestine circumstances, or taking money. He was willing to help to the extent he was, he explained, because he believed basically what we did about current world problems and, after all, had lived in WOLADY for many years and regarded it as his "second home". On the basis of this interview and a review of Subject's file, Subject, impressed the case officer as a somewhat disingenuous egoist who, despite a genuine sympathy for WOLADY, regarded his cooperation with the Station, primarily as a means of insuring his business contacts with INPURE and as something which had to be kept to a minimum lest it limit his independence or detract him in any way from his business and personal interests. This impression served as the basis for the evaluation of Subject contained in Reference A.

5. The case officer's impression of Subject changed considerably with the next meeting, which was held on 18 October. At this meeting, the case officer gave Subjecta defensive briefing for his trip and went over general reporting requirements. Subject surprised the case officer with his friendliness and cooperativeness, and went to great pains to explain that he was more than willing to cooperate with the Station as long as he did not become so deeply involved in intelligence work that his business or personal life was adversely affected. The case officer was impressed by Subject's apparent sincerity and got the definite impression that ever since receiving the Intourist invita- tion, Subject had been fearful he was again going to be asked to accept a double agent role which, if it materialized, would require him to become far more deeply involved in intelligence work than he wished. Sensing both Subject's relief at not being asked to under- take a more demanding assignment and his concern to make it clear that his heart was nevertheless in the right place, the case officer used the opportunity to again pose the question of whether Subject would be willing to report on a routine basis on persons who booked travel through his agency to the USSR. The case officer told Subject that this information could be forwarded to the Station through the LNPURE officer and assured him that his cooperation in supplying such infor- mation would not involve him in a series of escalating intelligence assignments. Evidently satisfied that his role would remain a limited one, Subject agreed to report the desired information on a regular basis. Moreover, he volunteered to check with other travel agencies in order to fulfill specific requirements for information on travelers to the Soviet Union who did not book their travel through his agency.

6. Subject was thoroughly debriefed upon his return from the USSR in early November 1966, at which time he continued to exhibit the same friendliness and cooperativeness noted in paragraph five. Fe reported that he was aware of no effort to assess, cultivate, or compromise him in the USSR. He provided information both on the formal proceedings of the conference and on individual Soviet and foreign participants, as well as on a Spanish businessman he met in Moscow. This information resulted in three Field Information Reports (HMM-10,870, 30 November 1966, HMM-10,871, 30 November 1966, HMM-10,875, 30 November 1966), one dispatch to Madrid (HMMA-30725, 1 December 1966), and a second to Santiago (IMMA-30749, 2 December 1966). Since furnishing information on his trip to the USSR, Subject has provided information on the travel of the Bolshoi Ballet in Mexico, on a Mexican traveler to the USSR, and on a Soviet student group which was slated to visit Mexico, but which for unknown reasons failed to arrive at the last minute.

7. The only Soviet Subject has recently been in contact with is LOGINOV, whom he occasionally sees on visa matters. According to Subject, their relationship during the past year has been strictly of a business nature and LOGINOV has shown no interest in extending it beyond this. Subject consequently appears to have little to offer in the way of an access agent to the Soviets in the foreseeable future. However, as the manager of one of five Mexican travel agencies representing Intourist and because of his apparently excellent contacts with key personnel of the other four travel agencies, he promises to be a useful referent on persons who book travel in Mexico to the Soviet Union and other Communist countries...

8. Despite the regularization of our relationship with Subject and his increased cooperativeness, we do not feel we are currently in a position to ask him to undergo an SGSWIRL interview. The relationship between the case officer and Subject at this time is essentially one of equals in which Subject is voluntarily assisting INFORT out of ideological motivation. It is true that his strong business interest in maintaining friendly relations with INFORT and INPURE provides us with a degree of control, but we feel that at present it is better left as a form of tacit control than brandished even subtly. It is our opinion that Subject would regard an SGSWIRL interview as an effort both to increase our control over him and to draw him deeper into the intelligence business. Such a reaction would in all probability undo much of our recent progress with Subject. Consequently, we would prefer to postpone an SGSWIRL interview until ofther we further solidify our relationship with Subject or we wish to use him in more sensitive work.

SUBJECT

REDTOP BESABER contact with Soviet Official

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:
A. HMAU-15222 1 February 1967

REFERENCES:
R. MEXICO CITY 0117 (in 87362)

1. In accordance with Reference A, Russell K. MUCHARIE
   (alias Ted KELLY) joined Willard B. ARSALON for a meeting with
   BESABER on 23 January (see Reference A) and met the latter
   alone for 45 minutes on 2 February.

2. After determining that BESABER has had social contact
   with Subject of 201-285412 (Iden A), Subject of 201-116900
   (Iden B), and AFTONGLE, the discussions with respect to Soviet
   officials in Mexico were limited to these three officials. In
   the course of the conversations, we told him that Iden A is
   a known KGB officer and unknown officer, but that
   we have no hard evidence to establish AEJUNGLE as an intelligence
   officer. He was told that our principal objective in his
   contact with Soviet officials is to obtain personality data
   and operational information or use against such Soviets, to
   effect their defection in place or outright. Since BESABER has
   been working with us extensively on the Polish target for over
   two years, none of the above was new to him.

3. Subject had the following to say about each of the
   Soviets mentioned above:

a. Iden A - This Soviet is just learning to handle
himself well. In the social situations demanded by his
position in the Embassy, BESABER believes he can be
induced to act his own "drum." Given a situation
brought in via a social relationship, could be
sufficiently persuasive, he would be an easy target
for a reasonably pretty, and well-dressed Polish female.
During the now social situation at the Polish Embassy,
at which BESABER had an opportunity to observe this
Soviet should defer more to AEJUNGLE rather because
of the latter's social race and high diplomatic
standing, or because of possible intelligence affinity
between the two could not be determined.

SUBJECT: Progress Report/LEGUET-2 (1 November 196-15 January 1967)

REFERENCE: HIMA-30722, 1 December 1966

The last Progress Report (see Reference) reported developments in the period through 31 October 1966; but not included were Subject's activities at the INTURIST Conference in Moscow to which Subject traveled on 22 October 1966. These activities will be reported below.

2. Contacts

## A. Subject and  KGB Case Officer

(201-355670)

Apart from Subject's frequent visits in Moscow during October 1966 from a former KGB case officer in Mexico, Oleg Nechiporenko, Subject since his return to Mexico from his European and Israel trip in mid-November has seen KGB officers on four occasions for a total time of less than an hour.

In Moscow, where Subject was attending the INTURIST Conference, Subject was visited briefly every day in his room at the Hotel National by Nechiporenko, from 24 October through 23 October.

First contact by the Soviets on Subject's return to Mexico was effected by FO case officer Alexander Vladimirovich Prikhodko (201-202579) on 3 December in Subject's office for a few minutes. On 8 December, Valentin Sergeyevich Loginov (201-280412), Subject's regular KGB case officer, called Subject down to the street outside Subject's office to present him with Bolshoi Ballet tickets. On 13 December, Loginov visited Subject's office and spent no more than half an hour there. And on 30 or 31 December, Subject was paid a brief visit by Yarel Yatskov, KGB officer (and possible candidate for resident) (20-120129) at Subject's office.

## B. Subject and Mexico City Station Case Officer

In the two months since Subject's return from Europe in mid-November 1966, the C/O, Prentice R. Larieine, has seen Subject six times for an approximate total of nine hours.

The C/O met Subject at his office on 22 November for two hours.

In December, the C/O met Subject three times, on 6 December at his office for almost two hours, on 13 December at the Hotel Reforma for a half-hour, and on 22 December at Subject's office for one hour.

On 7 January 1967, the C/O and his wife took Subject and his wife out for dinner at the Belvedere Room of Hotel Continental Hilton, to reciprocate for a former invitation to Subject's room. On 12 January, the C/O met Subject at the latter's office for one hour.

3. Operational Developments

## A. Subject/KGB

Subject arrived in Moscow on 20 October 1966 to attend the INTURIST Conference.

to which travel agents on a world-wide basis had been invited. On Subject's second
day in Loncow, Gle/ Nechiporanko, Subject's former Stolet C/O in Mexico, came to
visit him at the Hotel Nastoral. Subject deliberately kept his son aby his side
so that Nechiporenko would find it difficult to have private words with him.
However, Nechiporenko came to visit Subject every day thereafter until Subject's
departure, bringing gifts of records, caviar, etc. then Nechiporenko found the
opportunity the first thing he told Subject was that he heard Subject had been a
"rabel" and had been difficult in Mexico. Subject, in his half-serious manner,
poohpohed the idea that ho was a rebel and told Nechiporenko earnestly that he
didn't have the time, effort or inclination to indulge in the cooperation that was
expected of him. It gave Nechiporenko the old line about friends "hasta in muerte"
but that he couldn't and wouldn't put out the old effort. Nechiporanko said that
urs too hard, because he and wanted to present Subject to his chief and now there
was no point to it. Subject shrugged this off. Nechiporenko asked Subject if he
would be willing to use his office as a letter-drop. Subject said, reprovingly
that that was not a very smart idea-since agents writing to his firm and to him
would then know of Subject's conduction with the Soviets and he would thus be
exposed. Nevertheless, Nechiporenko told Subject to think it over and talk to
Valentin (Loginov) in Mexico about it. Also, Nechiporenko told Subject that they
hadn't forgotten about the "branch office" and that Subject shouldn't feel bad
about the delay in setting it up. Subject ridiculed that idea, saying that it was
the Soviets who should feel bad; as for him, he couldn't be bothered in the future
with the trips and time involved. Nechiporenko, still not chastened, asked if
Subject would provide information on all changes in visa regulations for travel in
Central or South America. Subject he said ho had given this information to the
Soviets in the past. Nechiporanko than asked Subject to continue to give such
information to Valentin.

Subject elicited from Nechiporenko that he was working in the Latin American
Section of the For.gn. Ministry, and that he was allowed to come and go as he
pleased to visit Subject. In the context of telling Subject that he saw then
Subject was not getting along with his Soviet friends, Nechiporenko said that he
would be coming back to Mexico next year.

One day while Nechiporenko was in the hotel room, the phone rang and Subject
picked up the phone. A female voice asked for "Givy." Subject banteringly replied
in Russian that "Givy" wasn't around, but wouldn't he do. In the ensuing conversa-
tion Subject found out that the caller was a 25 year old student, her address and
telephone number, and made a date to meet her the following day at the Latin Station
exit of the metro. Nechiporanko was all in favor of Subject making the date, and
as a matter of fact: came the next day to take Subject's son to the circus so that
Subject would be free. /Comment: Subject said that he never did go to meet the rate
girl, but told Nechiporenko that he hau. gone and the girl had not shown. Subject
is of the opinion this was not a provocation by the Soviets, but he shied away
because he did not want to be involved in anything indiscreet./

When Alexander Trikhonko dropped in unexpectedly at Subject's office on 3
December, while Subject's wife and son were present, the Soviet asked what hi could
have lunch with Subject, and the latter put him off telling Trikhonko to call next
week. /Comment: Trikhonko did not call./

On 8 December, Valentin Loginov, two called Subject's office by phone to
come come down to the street, saw Subject for just a minute to present him
with two tickets to the Bolshoi Ballet for 9 December. /Comment: Subject attended./


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 334

On 23 December, Loginov came unannounced to Subject's office and prevailed on him to have coffee with him nearby. The Soviet presented Subject with four bottles of vodka for Christmas, and began to ask Subject a series of personal questions:

1.  ) How had Subject left Poland for Paris after WWII – had his documentation been legal or illegal? Subject answered that it was legal.
2.  ) How was he able to enter Paris – did he have a valid French visa? Subject said he did. How long did he stay in Paris? Subject said a few months.
3.  ) Was he released from service with the Polish UB? Subject said yes. Were there any conditions to this release? Subject said no. Was he supposed to be contacted by the Poles? Subject said yes, and related the story of how he was contacted in Mexico (in March 1965) by a Polish diplomatic courier who brought a letter from Subject's old boss in the US, and how Subject answered that letter. Had Subject's response to the Poles been positive or negative? Subject said neutral. Asked why, Subject replied that he believed that eighty percent of the Poles were anti-Soviet. Loginov said "you are right."

WOFACT

Loginov asked to Subject ease getting along with the American airlines schedule with. Subject said ta fine, and asked why. Loginov said that maybe, if Subject has the chance he can l'earn the name of "the director o---" in Parisco." Subject told Loginov he was crazy to think Subject could get that information. When Loginov persisted in knowing whether Subject would tell the Soviets if he did get that information, Subject dismissed the topic with a coy "maybe."

Subject promised to show Loginov the documents that backed up his answers to Loginov's questions.

On either 30 or 31 December, Pavel Yatskov dropped by Subject's office to give him some gifts he had brought back from Moscow. /Comment: Subject had done Yatskov a favor during the Soviet's travels in Mexico by arranging for Subject's travel agent in Paris to assist Yatskov./. Yatskov expressed gratefulness to Subject and presented him with a bottle of Caucasian wine, some vodka, a decorative box and 150 grams of caviar. Yatskov (was no longer toits the post of Soviet Consul in Mexico, and is a possible candidate for KGB training) told Subject that he is also grateful for what Subject has done for "them", and he is sure that Subject will not leave them alone in the realization of their German ideals. And Yatskov further stated that he and Subject have very much in common, and that they should meet. He then left that Yatskov would call Subject.

B. Subject/Mexico City Station

The C/O met Subject at his office on 22 November 1966 to debrief him on the results of his trip to Moscow (see paragraph 3 A. above). In addition to providing information on his contacts with Naniporenko, Subject gave incidental information concerning a former Soviet Jew he met, and the anti-American attitude of a travel agent from Chile.

On 8 December, in Subject's office, Subject reported to the C/O about the brief contacts he now had with Frikhodko and Loginov on 3 and 8 December. The C.O, in response to a station request, re-opened with Subject the topic of the Jewish community support that Secretary of Gobernación Echeverría is alleged to have sought in his candidacy for next president of Mexico. Subject related again the story of how Jacobo Zabludovsky had come to mention the matter to Subject, including the fact that Subject was being proposed as one of five influential members of the Jewish community for Echeverria (Zabludovsky did not mention the others).

The C/O requested that Subject check further with Zabludovsky when he had the opportunity.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 335

On 13. eecervor Subject, reported to the C/O about Loginov's personal questions asked of Subject that same day (see paragraph 3 A. above). The C/O asked Subject if he had inquired of Loginov why the latter was asking such questions. Subject replied that he had not, and thought he was completely puzzled by this tack on the part of the Soviets. But Subject said he felt perfectly at ease in telling the truth to the Soviets, and had no hesitation in showing them his documentation.

The C/O dropped by Subject’s office on 22 December, after having delivered a Christmas gift of liquor to Subject’s home the previous day. Subject reported on Soviet travel for Georgi Visko, and said he had met Visko's replacement-Victor M. Ivanov.

Subject mentioned that he had received a holiday season letter from Sidney Weintraub, U.S. State Department official now in Chile/Comment: Weintraub hoped to get Subject of the Soviets in Mexico through Subject. Nothing ever came of it.

Subject remarked that he had received a firm invitation from the manager of Air France in Mexico to go or the inaugural flight of Air France to Red China (Shanghai) possibly in April 1967, to which Subject had replied that he "would love to go."

To the C/O Subject expressed himself as neutral about his going, but asked the C/O if he had any interest in his taking the trip. The C/O replied that Subject would be advised.

The C/O then discussed seriously with Subject the question of how complete his break-off from the Soviets really is, inasmuch as there was some skepticism about his conduct (the C/O told Subject that the skepticism came from 'higher up', which incidentally the C/O did not share). The C/O asked Subject to explain his willingness to report the name of the chief in Mexico, and his willingness to turn his personal documentation over to the Soviets. Subject’s reply boiled down to this: he was convinced that his break-off was more than adequate because he had reached the conviction to deny the Soviets anything and everything (the Station's objective), even though he might jokingly stall them. Being primarily was consistent with his personality. He explained his willingness, even more his desire, to show those "bastards" he couldn’t be bought off them. Subject asked the C/O to check with his bosses to see if he could be go-ahead on passing the documentation if the Soviets came after it.

On 12 January 1967, the C/O received the Station's expression of interest in having Subject follow up the invitation from Air France) asked Subject for more details concerning the invitation from Air France, and gave him the go-ahead to pursue the matter.

The current C/O, Prentice R. Lurleine, will turn Subject over to Francis J. Coigne before Lurleine's departure from Mexico the end of January 1967.

INFO: Chie, WH Division

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: REDTOP/Operational BESABER contact with Valentin S. LOGINOV (201-285412)

REFERENCE: MEXICO CITY-9930

1. BESABER first met LOGINOV casually on 14 December 1965 at a Polish Embassy reception for a visiting Parliamentary delegation. No plans were inde for recontact, although cards were exchanged and BESABER reported that LOGINOV was quite friendly.

2. It was not until 4 October 1966, almost a year later, that BESABER again ran into LOGINOV at another Polish Embassy reception, this one in honor of the departing Polish Ambassador. On that occasion LOGINOV expressed an interest in buying some of the mosales that BESABER produces. When LOGINOV found out that Mrs. BESABER was an avid tennis player, he let it be known that he was too, and would enjoy getting together for a game. (Parenthetically, be mentioned that he played regularly at the French Club, but that he did not enjoy the atmosphere there because there were too many Germans.) Finally, when BESABER mentioned that he very much liked Russian vodka, LOGINOV said he would sell him some at Embassy discount prices.

3. On 13 October 1966 LOGINOV tried unsuccessfully to contact BESABER by phone to purchase some mosaics for the Russian athletes who were were in town in connection with the "Little Olympics." BESABER unfortunately never got the message that LOGINOV left (although we picked it up on LIENVOY).

4. The Station decided at this point to have BESABER wait for LOGINOV to make the next move, but when by 15 December

there had not been any signs of action, BESABER was instructed to try to get in touch with LOGINOV regarding the purchase of vodka (for Christmas). When Christmas passed without any luck in contacting LOGINOV (BESABER was extremely busy during this period) we decided to change tactics a bit.

5. Per Station instructions BESABER phoned LOGINOV on 12 January 1967 and made arrangements to drop by the Embassy the following morning to show LOGINOV the catalogs of his mosaic-vare. BESABER was instructed to take advantage of this meet to try to establish some kind of reason for continuing the relationship (tennis and vodka buying were suggested.). As it turned out LOGINOV gave BESABER the necessary opening. After a cursory, but polite look at BESABER's catalogs he LOGINOV dismissed this subject by saying that he was not in the immediate market for any of BESABER's merchandise, but might be in the future. He then changed the subject, mentioned that he was in charge of looking for a house in Cuernavaca to be üsed by Embassy personnel (LIENVOY confirms that LOGINOV has the responsibility for renting a house in Cuernavaca as a summer retreat for wives and children.) LOGINOV told BESABER that he was prepared to pay 5,000 MX ($400.00 U.S.) per month for June, July and August 1967. He warts a four-bedroom (or more) house with a heated swimming pool and garden. LOGINOV mentioned that in 1966 the Embassy had rented a house on Calle Humboldt, that they had liked it, but that he was not sure they could get a lease again this year. He several times asked BESABER, who lives in Cuernavaca, to help him in locating a suitable house. BESABER of course said he would be delighted to assist LOGINOV and promised to phone him as soon as he found something. On this note the meeting ended.

6. BESABER will be out of town for two weeks (on vacation in Acapulco and in the U. S., as set forth in reference.) In the meantime, he will get one of his employees to look for housing for LOGINOV in Cuernavaca. Shortly after his return to Mexico (about 6 February) he will contact LOGINOV with a suggestion that he come down to look at whatever housing leads have been developed and/or to play tennis and enjoy a day in Cuernavaca.

7. The purpose of this exercise is to establish a familiar social relationship between BESABER and LOGINOV, one that will permit the Station to further assess LOGINOV. To date BESABER's first impressions were not particularly en- lightening other than his feeling that LOGINOV is susceptible. to further social development. The Station will encourage this activity with BESABER and it will be helpful if Headquarters personnel, if they see BESABER during reference trip, also encourage him.

8. One further matter for the record; BESABER was first introduced to LOGINOV by BERKEP. They again were together at the Polish Embassy on 4 October 1966. Although BESABER has, not told BEWEEP of his meet with LOGINOV on 13 January it is only because BESABER has not seen BEWEEP since before Christmas. BESABER has been instructed to be perfectly open with BEWERP about having seen LOGINOV and in fact it may turn out that LOGINOV and BEWEEP will visit BEÉSABER together. (LOGINOV referred to the possibility in his 13 January meet with BESABER).

9. The Station seen no reason why BESABER cannot handle the development of RETKEP and LOGINOV at the same time. Where possible we will try to have BESASER arrange to cultivate them Deparately, but since the two targets are personal friends and see each other quite frequently, we plan to have BESABER be quite candid fitting is relationship with one to the other.

10. Finally, we are well aware that since BESABER BAY well be compromised to the poles, his relationship with LOGINOV will have to be considered in this light. On the other hand there seems little to be lost, and possibly a great deal to be gained by having BESABER continue to try to develop a close relationship with this Soviet target.

1 The Chairman. The hearing will please come to order.

2 Mr. Bundy, would you please stand and take the oath.

3 Do you swear that the testimony you will give in this

4 hearing will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but

5 the truth, so help you God?

6 Mr. Bundy. I do.

7 The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz.

8 TESTIMONY OF MCGEORGE BUNDY

9 Mr. Schwarz. Would you state your full name and address

10 for the record, please?

11 Mr. Bundy. My name is McGeorge Bundy. I live in New

12 York. My home address is 1040 Fifth Avenue.

13 Mr. Schwarz. And you are currently the Chairman or the

14 President of the Ford Foundation?

15 Mr. Bundy. The President of the Ford Foundation.

16 Mr. Schwarz. In the Kennedy Administration what position

17 did you hold?

18 Mr. Bundy. I was Special Assistant for National Secur-

19 ity Affairs.

20 Mr. Schwarz. And you held that all the way through the

21 Kennedy Administration and for how many years in the Johnson

22 Administration?

23 Mr. Bundy. I held that office from the beginning of the

24 Kennedy Administration to the end of February 1966.

25 Mr. Schwarz. Prior to commencing work with the Kennedy

TOP SECRET

1 Administration, had you had anything to do with the Central
2 Intelligence Agency?

3 Mr. Bundy. I had a brother who worked for many years in
4 the Central Intelligence Agency. I occasionally talked with
5 members of the Agency during the forties and the fifties, both
6 about substantive questions of what one thought about the
7 conditions in the Soviet Union, and occasionally also about
8 efforts that they were then making to recruit talented
9 graduates of colleges.

10 Mr. Schwarz. You mentioned your brother. To put some-
11 thing of a different kind in the record than we have gotten
12 recently, would you recount the position taken by Allan Dulles
13 in connection with the problem that your brother had in the
14 1950's.

15 Mr. Bundy. Well, my brother came under attack from
16 Senator Joseph McCarthy. And the ground was, as I recall
17 it, in general that he had been a friend and supporter of
18 Alger lliss and was therefore not to be trusted in a place
19 as sensitive as the Central Intelligence Agency.

20 Allan Dulles -- and my impression is that this was
21 quite characteristic of him -- took an extremely firm stand
22 on this matter, and stood by his estimate that my brother was
23 in fact in no sense a security risk, rather, to the con-
24 trary. And the defense was successful, and my brother
25 continued in the Central Intelligence Agency until the Kennedy

1 Administration came in, at which time he moved over to the
2 Defense Department.

3 Mr. Schwarz. We have indicated to you that we are going
4 to discuss the countries of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and
5 Vietnam, although not much on Vietnam. And the majority and
6 minority staff have shown you some documents of that period,
7 some 15 years ago. Before I get to those three countries,
8 I would like to ask you some questions about a subject
9 called Executive Action. Have you ever heard of the subject
10 called Executive Action?

11 Mr. Bundy. Yes, I have.

12 Mr. Schwarz. When did you first hear of it?

13 Mr. Bundy. Well, as I have told your staff, that is a real
14 difficulty for me, because I cannot pinpoint the time at
15 which I heard of it. My impression was that it was some time
16 in the early months of 1961.

17 Mr. Schwarz. And do you have a recollection as to the
18 context in which you heard about it, the person from whom you
19 heard about it, and will you provide to the Committee your
20 full recolection of the subject of Executive Action in the
21 early 1961?

22 Mr. Bundy. Would it help if I try to describe in a
23 general way what I now understand of this matter, the
24 part which is recollection and the part which is clarified
25 by discussions with the staff and what I now think about it?

1 Mr. Schwarz. Would you distinguish, though, the part

2 that is recollection and the part that is based upon other

3 matters?

4 Mr. Bundy. That is exactly what I would like to do.

5 The part that is recollection is very vague. And I

6 would say that I have no recollection of more than one conver-

7 sation on this subject. And the impression that sticks in

8 my mind is that I was told about it in a general way. And

9 it was described to me as an effort to study through the

10 possibilities by which one might act against an individual

11 in a context other than that of espionage and counter-espionage,

12 a context more political.

13 Mr. Schwarz. When you say "act against an individual",

14 act in what fashion?

15 Mr. Bundy. Act in a variety of fashions, as I recollect

16 it, but up to and including killing the individual.

17 The two things that I think are clear in my recollection

18 about that -- three -- one, that it was a concept presented

19 or described to me -- I was in effect being briefed on it.

20 Two, that it was entirely an untargetted -- that it

21 was in no sense a plan to do anything to anyone.

22 And third, and I think quite important, that it was

23 not anoperation which had any specific target.

24 Mr. Schwarz. You said you were in effect briefed on it.

25 By whom?

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Bundy. That is what I don't know. I cannot

2 recollect who it was. And I think it inapproprate to guess

3 when I have no recollection.

4 Mr. Schwarz. What time? I don't mean what time of day,

5 but what time?

6 Mr. Bundy. As I say, sometime I think in the early

7 months of 1961. And searching memory is an uncertain busi-

8 ness, but it sticks in my mind that I heard about it in the

9 rooms of the Executive Office Building. And that

10 would place it in time, because I moved from the Executive

11 Office Building to the West Basement of the White House sometime

12 after the Bay of Pigs, perhaps in May.

13 Mr. Schwarz. So based on that fact you place it in

14 time sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs and sometime after--

15 Mr. Bundy. After my arrival in Washington.

16 Mr. Schwarz. And when did you arrive in Washington?

17 Mr. Bundy. About the 10th of January. I would place

18 it more closely, because I think it was after I was in the

19 Office of the Special Assistant, which, of course, was occupied

20 until the 20th of January by others.

21 Mr. Schwarz. So you place it after the 20th of January,

22 but before the Bay of Pigs, which was April 14 or 17?

23 Mr. Bundy. That is right.

24 Mr. Schwarz. Did it come up in a context where you

25 urged that such a capacity be created?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

# TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Bundy. No.

2 Mr. Schwarz. What context did it come up in?

3 Mr. Bundy. It came up in a context in which it was being described to me by someone else. And that is really about as far as I can take it with precision.

5 Mr. Schwarz. WAs it described to you by someone else as a capacity in being?

8 Mr. Bundy. As a capacity -- and this is not something I want to be too certain about, Mr. Schwarz, but my recollection would be that it was a capacity coming into being.

11 Mr. Schwarz. Now, receiving that information, did you take any steps to discourage or dissuade the person, whoever it was, who was describing to you the capacity coming into being?

15 Mr. Bundy. What I recollect is that I was satisfied with the description I received on two points.

17 First, that this was not an operational activity, and would not become such without two conditions: first, that there be a desire or a request or a guidance that there should be planning against some specific individual; and second, that there should be a decision to move against an individual.

23 Being satisfied that these two things were not happen-ing -- and I am now giving you a reconstruction rather than a precise recollection -- I am confident that what I did was

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

TOP SECRET

1 to place this notion in the category of hypotheticals, of
2 things with no current urgency to them, and in that sense
3 not a question that cried for attention in the sense that
4 so many others did. If I may make a straightforward compari-
5 son, we were, I think, even before the inauguration, but
6 certainly very quickly thereafter, very heavily engaged in
7 a real question of choice, which was the question of choices
8 around what would you do with the Cuban brigade which led
9 eventually to the Bay of Pigs. And that occupied a very
10 large amount of time and attention, as did the crisis in Berlin
11 and the crisis in Laos.

12 In the same period there were briefings on contingency
13 plans for the uses of nuclear weapons, other weapons, and a
14 whole swarm of, sort of, and here were reports that came
15 naturally to the Special Assistant's office, which was also
16 being reorganized.

17 So, I think that what I did was simply to put this one
18 aside. I cannot claim to have thought about it seriously,
19 because it was in the flow of business that would come to the
20 Special Assistant's office.

21 Mr. Schwarz. I want to see if we can be more precise
22 on dates to check on what other evidence we have. We have
23 other evidence that discussions of this matter were going
24 on in the Central Intelligence Agency on the 25th and 26th
25 of January 1961.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

TOP SECRET

1 Now, are you able to testify with respect to the likeli-
2 hood of the conversation you have recounted taking place
3 prior to the 25th or the 26th of January 1961.

4 Mr. Bundy. I would rate it very, very unlikely.
5 This is a matter I have thought about since you did mention
6 those dates to me. And I would say that the chance that
7 within the first four days after being sworn in I would have
8 been drawn to consider this question is, from my side, as
9 near zero as I can put it. I had been teaching international
10 relations over a period of ten years. I was deeply interested
11 in many of the immediate problems, most notably the problem of
12 the crisis in Berlin and the concomitant question of relations
13 with the Soviet Union. And I was preoccupied with all of
14 the things that happened when you moved to Washington from
15 helping the Secretary to buy a house, and working out a
16 staff, and I was under instruction from the President to
17 reorganize the White House National Security staff. This
18 subject was far out of my mind, and I would not have brought
19 it up. I doubt that anyone wouldhave brought it to
20 me in those early days.

21 The Chairman. May I interrupt for a moment.
22 As I understand your testimony, Mr. Bundy, you were
23 briefed on the concept of Executive capability sometime early
24 in 1961, and you can't remember now who it was who briefed you.

25 Do you recall whether or not you instructed anyone at

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

# TOP SECRET

1 the CIA to develop such a capability?

2 Mr. Bundy. I am sure I gave no instruction. But it is
3 only fair to add that I do not recall that I offered any
4 impediment after I was briefed.

5 The Chairman. But your best recollection is that some-
6 body toldyou that such a capability was being developed?

7 Mr. Bundy. I don't want to be too firm on that, but that
8 would be my best recollection.

9 The Chairman. We received testimony from Mr. Bissell.

10 Are you acquainted with Mr. Bissell?

11 Mr. Bundy. Yes, sir. I have known him a long time, and
12 he has been a great friend of mine.

13 The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz, since you are very familiar
14 with the record, are you going to take Mr. Bundy through the
15 record of Mr. Bissell's testimony?

16 Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bissell testified --

17 The Chairman. And we have the transcript. If it would
18 be helpful for Mr. Bundy to look directly at the transcript.

19 I think he should have it.

20 Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bissell's testimony was, first, that
21 in the first instance he said he did not recall any specific
22 conversation. Then, however, he said, after having reviewed
23 certain notes by Mr. Harvey, he concluded that if Mr. Harvey's
24 note indicated, as they did, that he, Bissell, told Harvey
25 in 1961 that he had been twice urged by the White House to set

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

11

1 up an Executive Action capability, then he had no reason to
2 doubt that testimony. And then he went on through a series
3 of comments to end up saying that he would have been given
4 that urging by either Rostow or Bundy, more likely Rostow.
5 First, let's focus on Rostow. Was Rostow involved in
6 the briefing?

7 Mr. Bundy. No -- now, that I can't tell you out of my
8 recollection, but only out of my knowledge of the way the
9 office was organized. The first things we did, Walt Rostow
10 and I, was to work out an informal but nevertheless reasonably
11 clear-cut division of labor. And the whole business of
12 what I thought of as special group business, namely, matters
13 that related to covert action, and would, if they came for
14 division, come through the special group, fell on my side
15 of that division. I don't recall that Mr. Rostow was ever
16 involved in any matter of this sort.

17 The Chairman. It is fair to say that this was Mr. Rostow's
18 testimony.

19 Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bissel is, as you say, a friend of
20 yours of long standing, and still is a friend of yours?

21 Mr. Bundy. Yes, he is.

22 Mr. Schwarz. Wehave his testimony which, while it did
23 have gradations within it, ended up saying that
24 he believed either you or Mr. Rostow urged him to set up the
25 Executive Action capability. And you have testified that the

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

TOP SECRET

12

1 fact is that you were given a briefing, and you didn't urge it,

2 but on the other hand you didn't say it should stop.

3 How can you explain, if you can, the testimony of your

4 friend Mr. Bissell, and the contrast between that and

5 your testimony?

6 Mr. Bundy. Well, as I understand Mr. Bissell's testi-

7 mony -- and I should add, so that there will be no misunder-

8 standing, that I have not only the advantage of discussions with

9 you, but I have talked with him about it -- as I understand

10 that testimony from that conversation, he was trying to ex-

11 plain a situation in which he had no reason to question an Agency

12 history to the effect that he first gave instructions on this

13 matter in February 1961. And in that context -- and he had

14 no reason to question the report that he had received

15 White House encouragement -- it is in that context that his

16 speculations about Mr. Rostow and about me seem to fall.

17 I would be surprised, if his memory were refreshed

18 with respect to the dates of January which you have des-

19 cribed to me, if he were to believe that any initiative in

20 this enterprise would come in the first instance from the

21 Kennedy Administration.

22 The Chairman. Mr. Bundy, our transcript of the

23 Bissell testimony makes it clear that Mr. Bissell himself

24 does not dispute the documented record. He said in effect,

25 if Harvey says that I told him that I had been twice instructed

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 16

TOP SECRET

1 by the White House to develop an Executive capability, I
have no basis on which to dispute that record.

Then when we asked him, very well, who in the White
House told you, and when were you told, he replied, it
must have been early in 1960, and I don't recall who told me,
but it must have been either Rostow or Bundy.

He then recounts that he had numerous conversations
with both of you during the period, and concludes that the
instruction must have come either from you or from Mr. Rostow.

Now, Mr. Rostow tells us he never gave such an instruc-
tion, and in fact has no memory of every having discussed
such an instruction.

Mr. Bundy. He would have in fact have had no authority
to give such an instruction.

The Chairman. That is right.

And he pointed that out.

Mr. Bundy. And in fact I wouldn't have the authority
to give any such instruction, and I would have been only
the channel to give such instruction.

Senator Baker. Who would have had the authority?

Mr. Bundy. If the authority were required outside the
AGency it would have to have been the President himself.

The Chairman. What I would like to ask you --

Mr. Bundy. Could I continue with Senator Baker's
question for one second.

TOP SECRET

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

TOP SECRET

14

My own impression as to this matter -- and I have already testified to the fact that I am relying on a recollection of a meeting of which there is no record -- is that had I been briefed on this essentially hypothetical internal, undirected character, it did not appear to me to be a matter that required further authority outside the CIA. That may or may not have been right, but that is the quick judgment I appear to have reached. Because I certainly did not raise the question with others.

Senator Baker. Do you recall that, Mr. Bundy, or is that your surmise?

Mr. Bundy. That is my reconstruction more than my --

I know I did not raise it, I did not press the question, and I did not feel, therefore, that it was a question that needed further analysis, and it did not, so far as I know, get further consideration inthe White House. My own recollection is that I didn'thear the words again in any serious con- text that I can recall until this year.

The Chairman. And you cannot recall who it was who briefed you?

Mr. Bundy. I really cannot.

Mr. Schwarz. Can you narrow the field?

Mr. Bundy. I can narrow the field. It would have to have been a senior officer at the Agency, or someone with previous understanding in the White House. I have no reason to suppose

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

15

Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

1 that it was the latter, but I cannot exclude that.

2 The Chairman. Might it have been Bissell himself?

3 Mr. Bundy. It surely might have been.

4 The Chairman. Based upon your best recollection of that

5 briefing, you have already testified that you interpose no

6 objection?

7 Mr. Bundy. I am pretty sure I satisfied myself as to

8 the character of the enterprise. But I did not interpose an

9 objection.

10 The Chairman. Do you recall, then, having reported the

11 briefing to the President?

12 Mr. Bundy. No, I don't.

13 The Chairman. Did it strike you -- before I ask that

14 question, based upon your best recollection of the briefing,

15 were you told that this was a new capability that was being

16 developed, or were you told simply that the Agency possessed

17 such a capability?

18 Mr. Bundy. I would put it that the Agency was working on

19 such a capability, but without any great sense of precision.

20 The Chairman. Were you given the impression at

21 that briefing that the Agency was seeking your authority or

22 the authority of the White House?

23 Mr. Bundy. I think they were testing my reaction, as

24 I now look back on it. But I do not recall that they were

25 seeking authority. If it had come to me as a matter of White

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

TOP SECRET

1 House authority, I know from the context -- my own concept
2 of my job what I would have done.

3 The Chairman. What would you have done?
4 Mr. Bundy. I would have had to take the matter to the
5 President, because I had no independent authority.

6 The Chairman. And you have testified that you did not
7 take the matter to the President?

8 Mr. Bundy. As far as I can recall, Mr. Chairman.
9 The Chairman. Well, this is a subject dealing, as it
10 does, with the development of a capability to kill that would
11 have been of the character that if you had been asked for
12 authority you would have discussed with the President?

13 Mr. Bundy. That is right.

14 The Chairman. And furthermore, is it not a subject of
15 a character that you would be very likely to recall?

16 Mr. Bundy. If I had been asked for authority I would
17 recall it. If I were the initiating or deciding agent, I
18 would recall that I had had that role.

19 You speak of the seriousness of it. It deals with a
20 capability to kill. One of the sobering facts about coming
21 into the government from outside into a sensitive position
22 like that one is the number of things on which you are briefed
23 which deal with the capability to kill. Contingency plans
24 for protecting West Berlin, contingency plans for the use of
25 nuclear weapons -- shelf plans, a shade more remote, perhaps,

1 for the use of different kinds of gases -- an operational plan

2 for the invasion of Cuba -- these were uncertainties as to

3 whether there would have to be military landings in Laos. In

4 the context of 1961 -- and I am not in any sense trying to un-

5 derstate the seriousness of the context of 1975-- this was a

6 hypothetical kind of a thing with two strong locks between

7 it and any decision. And I simply didn't pay it the attention

8 then that we are paying to it now. We are right to pay

9 that attention now.

10 The Chairman. I understand that very well. And this

11 Committee is endeavoring in every way it can to place this

12 whole issue within the context of the time. Nevertheless, we

13 are faced with a very real dilemma. We know that at the very

14 time you were being briefed the Agency was not only interested

15 in developing a capability, but was in fact engaged in a

16 series of attempts to assassinate Castro, and had been in-

17 volved in other murder plots and murder attempts against the

18 leaders of certain foreign governments.

19 The question we are endeavoring to answer is whether

20 the Agency had been authorized by the policy makers of the

21 government to engage in this activity, or whether it was

22 operating fast and loose on a wild gambit of its own in an

23 area of extreme sensitivity that could have the most serious

24 repercussions upon the government of the U.S. and its

25 reputation in the world.

TOP SECRET

1 We are told by Mr. Bissell, who apparently was not only
2 a very good friend of yours, but also a very good friend of Mr.
3 Rostow's --
4 Mr. Bundy. That is right.
5 The Chairman. -- a man whose credibility as a witness
6 would seem to have to be respected -- that he was at least
7 engaged in developing such a capability on direct instructions
8 from the White House.

9 But when we pressed him for specifics, his testimony
10 becomes very vague. He can't remember just who it was who
11 told him, he can't dispute the record, which says that in effect,
12 he so advised Mr. Harvey when he engaged Mr. Harvey to develop
13 the capability. And everyone else of high authority in
14 the Administration that we have questioned so far testifies
15 that it was not the policy of the Administration to engage in
16 assassination, and no such attempts were ever authorized,
17 and indeed, with the exception of one occasion in the Special
18 Group, the subject never even surfaced for discussion.

19 And when it did, if it did, it was quickly shot down.
20 Nevertheless, the CIA was in fact embarked upon such
21 attempts during the period under review.

22 Now, we are led to conclude either that we are not
23 being told the truth concerning the policy of the Administration,
24 which is very hard for me to accept, given the reputation of
25 the witnesses that have come before us, for integrity and

1 truthfulness, or that the CIA was running wild, and acting on
2 its own initiative, engaging in murder plots, murder attempts,
3 and not informing, let alone securing the authority from,
4 those in government who held the responsibility, which in a way
5 is even more frightening.

6 Now, you tell us that you remember being briefed. You
7 don't remember advising the President. It didn't seem too
8 important at the time. Did you ever follow up on whether such
9 a capability had in fact been perfected by the agency?

10 Mr. Bundy. I don't recall pursuing the matter at all,
11 Mr. Chairman, any more than I would have pursued any other
12 shelf capability on which no question was being pushed to me,
13 either from below or above.

14 If I may go back and comment on one aspect of your,
15 I think, important and impressive description of
16 the difficulty the Committee faces, I am sure that if in the
17 early months of 1961 I had known what I now know, in part from
18 the newspapers and in part from discussions with your staff,
19 about what was really in train, I would have had a very
20 different approach.

21 Senator Mondale. Mr. Chairman.
22 The Chairman. Senator Mondale.
23 Senator Mondale. Yesterday Secretary Rusk testified be-
24 fore us. And some of the minutes or notes made following one
25 of themeetings of the Special Group Augmented at least suggest

1 that the question of assassination occurred. And, Mr. Rusk
2 said, did you think anyone would bring that up at a town
3 meeting? And by that I gather he meant that these meetings
4 had large attendance from all different groups and prinicples
5 and staff assistants and so on, and as a result, if there
6 were matters of exceeding delicacy, that was not the forum
7 at which such matters would be discussed.

8 Would you comment on that?
9 Mr. Bundy. Yes. My impression would be that the
10 Secretary was probably referring to the much discussed meeting
11 of August 10, 1962.

12 Senator Mondale. Right.
13 Mr. Bundy. That was a large meeting, 16 or 18 people.
14 And the comment seems to be pertinent to that meeting. The
15 Special Group as such, the one which I would have had in
16 mind, for example, in early 1961, was set up under a national
17 security regulation of some sort whose number was 54/12.
18 Senator Mondale. That was the Special Group.

19 Mr. Bundy. That was the Special Group. And the Special
Group in and of itself was quite a small group.

21 Senator Mondale. But people would volunteer to attend

22 Mr. Bundy. No.

23 Senator Mondale. They would not?

24 Mr. Bundy. No. The meeting of August 10 is a very
25 special meeting in a variety of respects. That included --

1 The Chairman. You were present at that meeting?

2 Mr. Bundy. I was present. My memory is entirely

3 a refreshed memory on this, I had no recollection of the

4 meeting until recent months. But I have found a scratch

5 pad that I apparently doodled on on that date, and it

6 shows who was there, and not much else.

7 Mr. Schwarz. There were some beautiful drawings.

8 Mr. Bundy. There were.

9 They were not very beautiful drawings.

10 The Special Group Augmented met in August -- and this

11 does coincide with my general recollection of the matter --

12 in response to concerns wihch were first, I think, and most

13 energetically pressed by Mr. McCone with respect to, what the

14 hell are the Russians doing in Cuba. And that was the center

15 of that meeting, and the center of later meetings, and the cen-

16 ter of a national security action memorandum of considerable

17 complexity which was put out toward the end of August, most

18 of which dealt with this question, how do we know what they

19 are going to do, what do we do if they do it, and so forth,

20 with respect to missiles in Cuba.

21 It was therefore in a sense much more than an ordinary

22 MONGOOSE meeting, let alone a Special Group meeting. And

23 while I quite agree with the Secretary that that meeting as

24 a planning session for anything as horrendous as assassina-

25 tion is implausible in the extreme. Quite serious covert

1 actions were discussed in the Special Group. And as your
2 Committee pursues its studies of covert action it will find
3 that that group is the anodal point for policy decisions, good
4 or bad, well or badly handled. And that was quite a small
5 group.

6 Senator Mondale. The reason I ask that is that it seems
7 to me that the Chairman's question pursues the two alternatives,
8 either what we now know to have occurred was ordered at the
9 highest level, or at a very high level, such as the Special
10 Group Augmented, or they operated on their own, in which case
11 they were out of control and irresponsible, or there was some
12 extra communications system that went around the formal struc-
13 ture that we have been examining, and would account for the sense
14 of authority that these operators testified to when they
15 were with us.

16 Now, their testimony was not very specific. They said,
17 we thought we had authority, and we think we heard from
18 somebody, and so on.

19 What are the changes, based upon your experience, that
20 there was such extra official communications and order passin

21 Senator Baker. Before Mr. Bundy answers, I might say
22 to Senator Mondale that I am struck by the first paragraph
23 of the Inspector General's report, which we don't have here
24 now, I don't believe, but as I remember it, it says, it is
25 difficult to reconstruct history of assassination plots, because

TOP SECRET

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

23

of the high sensitivity of the subject matter, no written records were kept, and it was not discussed at open meetings. That is generally what was said. And it seems to me that is implying, then, that as a matter of policy there was no formalization of this sort of communication.

I am sorry to interrupt.

Senator Mondale. Yes.

And in that August 10 meeting two or three principals testified that it did come up. And in fact it is not reflected in the notes.

Mr. Bundy. Perhaps the best way for me to begin at least with an answer to your question is to describe my own sense -- my own understanding of the way in which covert operations of all types were brought forward. And this was perhaps the most important and the most constantly reiterated fact of the process that I was exposed to when I began to consider this whole range of subjects on coming to Washington. And whether it was with Mr. Gordon Gray, my predecessor, or with Allen Dulles, or with incoming and outgoing friends in the Department of State, or with Mr. Bissell, or with anyone else concerned with these matters, what I learned then and what I applied throughout my time there to the best of my ability was that all covert operations, whether intelligence operations, clandestine political activity, and clandestine propaganda activity, and clandestine subversion, or sabotage,

1 which did occur in the case of Cuba, all of them took their
2 authority from and came for their authority to the 54/12
3 group.

4 And when there was a question in such a meeting as to
5 whether the matter required further judgment, it was the
6 responsibility of the Chairman of that group to make sure that
7 that was checked out.

8 The papers will usually say, higher authority, et cetera,
9 et cetera, and the President's name will often not appear --
10 any more than the precise character of the operation is likely
11 to appear in the minutes for the reasons that Senator Baker
12 has spoken of.

13 But I never knew of any operation of this kind of any
14 sort, with one exception, which is quite different, which did
15 not have that channel. The exception is the Bay of Pigs,
16 which was so big, so complicated, and overflowed in so many
17 directions, and in which the President himself was involved in
18 so many ways, as he fully recognized and explained at the time,
19 that it did not go through this Committee process, it went
20 through a quite Presidential process, and everybody involved
21 knew that..

22 But with that one exception, I would have told you up
23 until the beginning of this current public discussion, that
24 was the way it went, and that nothing went outside it, and
25 that the Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agencies, with

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

# TOP SECRET

1 their more sensitive" intelligence operations, were meticulous

2 in that respect.

3 Now, I clearly am wrong. But that is what I would have

4 told you.

5 Senator Mondale. Well, are you wrong?

6 In other words, what you testified to --

7 Mr. Bundy. Excuse me, I misstate myself. I beg your

8 pardon for interrupting.

9 I am wrong in that things happened that didn't go through

10 that group.

11 Senator Mondale. Yes.

12 In other words, that is the big question, either they wer

13 acting on authority, which apparently flowed around channels --

14 The Chairman. Covertly --

15 Senator Mondale. Covertly -- or they were acting on their

16 own, and our attempts to find direct authority in these official

17 meetings led us nowhere.

18 And your testimony is that you find it very unlikely

19 that there was this covert way of communicating authority.

20 Mr. Bundy. My testimony was that I wouldn't

21 have believed it existed. I have to consider the same al-

22 ternative that the Chairman has so clearly pointed out. I

23 don't find it agreeable to conclude that the Agency was a

24 rogue elephant at a time when I strongly believe it was not.

25 Senator Mondale. We asked General Taylor that question,

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 29

# TOP SECRET

26

1 and he said he found it incredible to believe that they
2 would have gone around the Special Group Augmented with such.
3 Mr. Bundy. General Taylor, of course -- and this is an
4 important point -- was a-pointed to this responsibility after
5 the Bay of Pigs, after a review of the failures that led to
6 the Bay of Pigs, and after a conclusion had been reached that
7 it would strengthen the White House to have a man with a parti-
8 cular responsibility for the oversight of intelligence opera-
9 tions. He was called military representative to the President,
10 but in the announcement of his appointment -- I happened to
11 look it up the other day -- President Kennedy made it clear that
12 he would be his representative for intelligence matters.
13 And he did in fact take over the chairmanship during the time
14 that he was military representative of all of the Special
15 Groups, 54/12, the Special Group Counterinsurgency, and the
16 Special Group Augmented, MONGOOSE. And when he said --
17 if he has testified that his expectation would have been
18 that nothing was going to go around him, he is saying exactly
19 what I thought through the same period.
20 Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, in that respect --
21 The Chairman. Before I forget the question, let
22 me ask, since you were at the August 10 meeting, and since
23 we have received testimony buttressed by certain documentary
24 evidence that the subject of assassination of Castro did
25 come up at that meeting, do you have any recollection of

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

TOP SECRET

1 subject coming up or being discussed?

2 Mr. Bundy. I don't recollect the meeting. And I don't recollect the subject ever coming up in a meeting of that size, or indeed in any -- I don't have any recollection of it coming up, although I do have a general recollection of there being times at which this possibility was heard of. I wouldn't want to testify that I never heard anyone say, there is somebody thinking about this, because that would be different from my vague recollection.

10 But I have no recollection of that meeting, and therefore none of any specific statement made by anyone in it.

12 The Chairman. Senator Baker?

13 Senator Baker. In that connection, before I go to the question I had in mind, is it fair to say, Mr. Bundy, that all, or virtually all, of your testimony this morning, about MONGOOSE, about the August 10 meeting, and about the general situation, is from reconstructed memory rather than first impression memory?

19 Mr. Bundy. I didn't want to go that far, Senator Baker. My knowledge, my sense of what 54/12 and Special Group Augmented were, and where they stood in the line of authority, is very clear, and is not reconstructed. I spent five years -- except for the time when General Taylor was there, I was the chairman of these things.

25 Senator Baker. Let's take a piece at a time, then.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

TOP SECRET

1 On the question of the Executive Action capability, I
2 believe referred to as the ZRRIFLE project --

3 Mr. Bundy. Imust say that if I had known that was its
4 name I would have looked harder, Senator Baker.

5 Senator Baker. It is a fairly picturesque name -- as
6 to Executive Action Capability, or ZRRIFLE, do you have a
7 separate recollection?

8 Mr. Bundy. I have a recollection of what I think of
9 is one, I don't want to say there wasn't more, but of
10 one discussion of the matter. And I know I was informed of
11 it in some fashion at the time.

12 Senator Baker. Do you remember by whom?

13 Mr. Bundy. That is my difficulty, as I said earlier,

14 I don't know.

15 Senator Baker. The reason I ask is, from the other
16 documentation I have, which consists primarily of the
17 Inspector General of the CIA's report, and maybe other
18 material that I can't think of at the moment, it is clear
19 and unmistakeable that they think of RZRIFLE or Executive Ac-
20 tion Capability as a White House initiative, or a White House
21 request of considerable insistence from the White House that
22 they get on with the job.

23 Mr. Bundy. That is totally inconsistent with my un-
24 reconstructed recollection.

25 Senator Baker. Let me track that carefully.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

TOP SECRET

1 Do you recall that there was not?

2 Mr. Bundy. I Can only speak for myself here, and for

3 my colleague Rostow, and my knowledge of his assignments.

4 I recall that his assignments would have made it wildly out

5 of place, and totally out of character, for him to initiate a

6 matter of this kind. And I recall that I did not. And I

7 recall that quite independently of any reconstruction of

8 recent months.

9 Senator Baker. I would like to limit this, then,

10 just to yourassignment.

11 Was it your general assignment to take care of so-

12 called covert operations?

13 Mr. Bundy. It was my assignment -- may I take a minute

14 on this?

15 Senator Baker. Yes, sir.

16 Mr. Bundy. There were two ways in which I could become

17 involved in covert -- three ways. I might have thought up

18 an idea myself. I will have to say that I have no recollec-

19 tion that I ever did. It was not a subject in which I had

20 an independent personal motivating interest. So,there were

21 two ways in which I could get involved in it. One was by

22 a proposal upward from the Agency or the Defense Intelligence

23 Services, which would come to the Special Group.

24 And the other was when the President had an interest--

25 and I did have an interest -- from time to time in these

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

TOP SECRET

30

1 matters. He had a great interest at different points in 1961, 1962, in doing more about Cuba. And part of the more he wanted to do was covert. And he would say so to me. And I would say so to somebody else.

Senator Baker. Can you give us examples of that?

Mr. Bundy. No, I can't. I can only say that the kind of things he was talking about was, why do all these raids not get us anywhere? They say they can do something about the oil refineries, why don't they? These are purely hypothetical, Senator Baker, but they would be in a category, subversion and sabotage.

Senator Baker. WAs it Harvey that was spoken of as our 007?

Mr. Schwarz. Once yesterday.

Senator Baker. Do you remember when Mr. Harvey was brought to see the President at the Oval Office?

Mr. Bundy. I have been told about that, but I am afraid that is non-refreshed recollection. I don't know anything about it.

Senator Baker. Would that have been the character of the things that the President was interested in, 007?

Mr. Bundy. I am not going to try to repair the record at this late stage and say that the President never read Ian Fleming.

Senator Baker. Or ever seen Ian Fleming?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Bundy. I don't think the President ever acted Ian

2 Fleming.

3 Senator Baker. I think that is right. But I think it...

4 is important for us, Mr. Bundy, to try to establish, as the

5 Chairman said, the range of available information or evi-

6 dence that sheds some light on the three alternative possi-

7 bilities, and the type of things that the President interested

8 himself in is terribly important in that respect.

9 I believe that you said you had no information or no

10 recollection of what particular situation, or what other

11 deals that were made he was interested in.

12 Mr. Bundy. I will put it more concretely than that.

13 The President said, can't we do something more about Cuba?

14 Why don't you get ahold of these people who are dealing with

15 this and see if they can't do better, and pass the word

16 that I am interested, that kind of thing.

17 Senator Baker. Do I understand that to mean that he never

18 spoke of a particular practice?

19 Mr. Bundy. I can't tell you that, because I know, the

20 record indeed reminds me, that particular actions that are

21 related to Cuba that came up through the group of ten

22 went to him, and some were approved and some were not.

23 So, he clearly looked at them.

24 I would have to have the documents there in order to

25 be precise, and I don't have them with me.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

# TOP SECRET

1 Senator Baker. Which documents?

2 Mr. Bundy. Documents which the Committee staff

7 or Tab 4 about the November 30, 1961, which authorizes

8 MONGOOSE?

9 Mr. Kelley. Tab 4.

10 Mr. Schwarz. May 5, '62, Lansdale Tab 21.

11 Senator Baker. Let's stop there, if I may.

12 Do you have a copy of this memorandum, Mr. Bundy?

13 Mr. Kelley. He will have it in a moment.

14 Mr. Bundy. One place these documents did not go is

15 into the memorabilia of former members.

16 Mr. Kelley. We are talking about Tab 4.

17 Senator Baker. Mine says, see Lansdale Tab 4.

18 Mr. Kelley. Yes. November 30, 1961.

19 Senator Baker. I would really prefer if someone gave

20 Mr. Bundy a copy of the same material I am working on.

21 Mr. Kelley. All right, that is the chronology.

22 Mr. Bundy. November 30, 1961?

23 Senator Baker. Yes, sir. It is on page 3, the third

24 item.

25 Mr. Bundy. I have it.

TOP SECRET

1 Senator Baker. President Kennedy's decision to begin

2 MONGOOSE. Is it clear, Mr. Bundy, that President Kennedy made

3 the decision to initiate the MONGOOSE program?

4 Mr. Bundy. No question.

5 Senator Baker. I notice in the staff interpretation

6 under the column "Issues and Questions" that they alleged

7 that you recall probably writing this memorandum.

8 Mr. Bundy. That is really a logical inference. The

9 President would not himself have written a long memorandum of

10 instructions of this kind. It is possible that General

11 Taylor wrote it. But I think it is more likely that I did.

12 But in any event, whichever of us did so was doing it as a

13 staff officer for the Prsident's convenience in recording

14 his decision.

15 Senator Baker. So at least to this extent there is

16 no question about the chain of command, or the chance to

17 control it, the President authorized it?

18 Mr. Bundy. Just to underline that point, as I recall

19 the paper which was shown to me, it is one from Mrs. Lincoln

20 to General Taylor saying, the President wants you to have

21 this as a description of the decisions.

22 Senator Baker. Would you repeat that?

23 Mr. Bundy. I think the covering memorandum on that

24 document is from Mrs. Lincoln to General Taylor, and it says,

25 the President wants you to have this as a record of his

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

1 decisions.

2 Senator Baker. Thank you, sir..

3 Do you have an independent recollection of the meeting

4 or the encounter with President Kennedy in connection with

5 MONGOOSE?

6 Mr. Bundy. Not a specific meeting, but of the process

7 which led to this decision, yes.

8 Senator Baker. Describe for me, if you will, what

9 MONGOOSE was intended to be?

10 Mr. Bundy. Well, MONGOOSE in a general way was the

11 whole set of things to be concerned with mostly, but not only,

12 covert activities against the Communist regime in Cuba.

13 Senator Baker. The chronology also quotes the memo as

14 saying, one, we will use our available assets to go ahead

15 with the discussed project in order to help Cuba overthrow

16 the Communist regime.

17 Can you elaborate on that?

18 Mr. Bundy. Not without documentary assistance beyond

19 what I have just said. It was to be a fairly wide ranging

20 program. I believe that what that really sort of implies

21 to me is that all departments are to cooperate, that the

22 Committee is to review possibilities, proposals, to seek

23 them out, and that the thing is to be coordinated by the

24 Committee, whose chairman will be -- this summary doesn't

25 say so, but my recollection is that the chairman was to be

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

# TOP SECRET

1 General Taylor, and it does say that General Lansdale
2 was to be the Chief of Operations.

3 The Chairman. I have some questions at this point, please.
4 Item 4 of this memorandum reads: "The NSC 54/12 Group
5 will be kept closely informed of activities, and will be
6 available for advice and recommendation".

7 Does this suggest to you that the regular channel was
8 supposed to operate with respect to MONGOOSE, that is to say,
9 a central role was to be played by the Special Group in
10 connection with its activities?

11 Mr. Bundy. It is a puzzling sentence to me as I read
12 it now. And I can't give you a precise answer on that. I
13 think the general answer has to be that the 54/12 Group continus:
14 through this period. General Taylor was the chairman of
15 both. The overlapping of membership was extensive. And
16 I think you would get a more precise answer as to the exact
17 relation from General Taylor than I am in a position to give
18 you.

19 The Chairman. I have a very clear memory of General
20 Taylor's testimony. And his testimony was that the Special
21 Group Augmented was the group that had charge of operation
22 MONGOOSE. It was further his testimony that all plans, all
23 operations, were to be brought to the Special Group Aug-
24 mented for its approval. And the approval of that Group
25 was necessary before any such plans were actually implemented.

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Bundy. I would certainly be clear on that, Mr.
2 Chairman. I thought you were asking whether there was a
3 further requirement that it go from the Special Group
4 Augmented to the Special Group. And I have no precise view
5 on that.

6 The Chairman. I see.

7 Now, when you refer to the NSC 54/12 Group --
8 Mr. Bundy. That is what I think of as the Special Group.
9 The Chairman. That is what you think of as the Special
10 Group.

11 I asked the question because the language is a little
12 fuzzy.

13 Mr. Bundy. It is.
14 The Chairman. This language might suggest that there is
15 an independent line of authority, and that the Special Group
16 Augmented or the Special Group was simply to be kept informed,
17 and its advice and recommendations would be taken under advise-
18 ment.

19 Mr. Bundy. I think myself, Mr. Chairman, that
20 we don't have a very serious problem here, because I would
21 agree with General Taylor's recollection that the Special
22 Group Augmented was the Cuba group.

23 Now, the Special Group is simply the same people less
24 two or three. And the only real operational value of this
25 paragraph is that perhaps the staff officer who serviced the

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 40

TOP SECRET

1 54/12 would be available in a decision to the staff officer
2 servicing the Special Group Augmented. But the decision-making
3 persons are simply a smaller number of the very people
4 that both General Taylor and I recollect as having the main
5 responsibility.

6 The Chairman. So according to your best remembrance,
7 you would agree with the testimony we have received from
8 General Taylor?

9 Mr. Bundy. Yes, I would.

10 The Chairman. Mr. Smothers?

11 Mr. Smothers. Mr. Bundy, perhaps we could get some help
12 in how the recollections come together here. I might pursue
13 for just a moment some of the background regarding other
14 sources of information you may have had regarding the subject
15 matter of his testimony.

16 You indicated earlier that you had talked with Mr.
17 Bissell about his testimony.

18 Did you talk with persons other than Mr. Bissell?

19 Mr. Bundy. Oh, yes.

20 Mr. Smothers. Did you talk with Mr. McNamara?

21 Mr. Bundy. Yes, indeed.

22 Mr. Smothers. Regarding these events?

23 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

24 Mr. Smothers. Have you spoken with Mr. Gilpatric?

25 Mr. Bundy. NO, I don't think I have.

5 Mr. Smothers. Are there others?

6 Mr. Bundy. I am sure there are. Mr. Rostow. Mr.

7 Goodwin. There may well be others, Mr. Schlesinger and Mr.

8 Dungam -- who has very little to do with it, but I talked

9 to them because of my own absence of recollection about the

10 Dominican Republic.

11 Mr. Smothers. Let me just raise a few questions regard-

12 ing those discussions, and perhaps it will be somewhat helpful

13 to us in trying to piece this together.

14 Has any documentary evidence passed between you and

15 the persons previously mentioned regarding the subject

16 matter of these hearings?

17 Mr. Bundy. Not that I know of.

18 Mr. Smothers. Did Mr. McCone provide you any documentary

19 evidence?

20 Mr. Bundy. No.

21 Mr. Smother. Did you receive any documentary evidence

22 from any source other than the staff?

23 Mr. Bundy. No -- I beg your pardon. When I testified

24 before the Rockefeller Commission I asked through that

25 Commission whether I could look at NCS files particularly in

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

2 And I was allowed to look at the NSAM files. And my memory was refreshed by NSAM-1, which I believe the committee has.

3 Mr. Smothers. Have you made a similar request to

4 persons now within the Agency for on the White House staff?

5 Mr. Bundy. No.

6 Mr. Smothers. Could we go back into your conversation

7 with Mr. Bissell? Could you describe for the Committee, please,

8 your reaction when Mr. Bissell indicated to you that he had in

9 testimony before this Committee told the Committee that

10 either you or Mr. Rostow had asked him to establish an Execu-

11 tive Action Capability?

12 Mr. Bundy. He didn't report it that way to me. He

13 reported it to me that the testimony that had been given by

14 others placed this event in February 1961. Testimony by

15 others indicated that he had said to them that he had been

16 encouraged to do this by the White House, and that in casting

17 around as to who might have encouraged, he had given the

18 names of Rostow and Bundy. I think this is roughly what

19 he said to me.

20 The Chairman. That was the character of his testimony?

21 Mr. Bundy. I told him that I thought he must

22 be wrong about Rostow, because that wasn't the way it worked,

23 and that my own recollection was not that we had encouraged

24 him, but that I had at some stage been informed about it.

1 We then went on to a discussion of what it was. And
2 we agreed that whatever else it was, it was not an operation
3 plan, and it was not targeted against anyone.

4 Mr. Smothers. What was his reaction to your comment
5 that he had been informed as opposed to initiating?

6 Mr. Bundy. I don't recall that we had a very extended
7 discussion on it. I don't recall his reaction, and I don't
8 recall exactly how I put the point.

9 The Chairman. Let me just ask at that point, the way you
10 have characterized Bissell's testimony correspnds with my
11 memory of it. It is hard for me, however, to understand
12 how Mr. Bissell -- why Mr. Bissell would have directed Mr.
13 Harvey to develop such a capability, and apparently represented,
14 if the documents are to be believed, to Mr. Harvey that he had
15 been twice instructed to do this by the White House, if he
16 had not in fact received such authority.

17 Do you think that Mr. Bissell would have undertaken
18 on his own initiative to develop such a capability and
19 simply represented to his subordinate that he was doing so on
20 instructions from the White House?

21 Mr. Bundy. I think there is a prior question, Mr.
22 Chairman, which is the credibility of the witness from whom he
23 is taking this recollection.

24 The Chairman. That is fair.

25 Though Mr. Bissell himself did not seem disposed --

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

TOP SECRET

Mr. Bundy. Mr. Bissell may not recollect that I did not give him this instruction, but I do, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Did Mr. Bissell at any time during the period under question, or at any later time, ever inform you of CIA activities or involvement in assassination attempts against any foreign leader?

Mr. Bundy. No.

The Chairman. Doesn't it strike you as strange, since Mr. Bissell was aware of such attempts, that he would not have told him?

Mr. Bundy. Well, I don't want, for reasons that I have already explained, to speculate as to why he did or did not. I was operating, working on the assumption that I would know that kind of thing if it existed.

The Chairman.Senator Mathias?

Senator Mathias. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to leave the record, or Mr. Bundy's mind, or in the alternative, my mind, in a state of confusion as to what exactly Mr. Bissell's recollection was.

Now, he was depending somewhat on Mr. Harvey's recollection and notes in the first instance. But as I recall, he was very clear as a matter of independent recollection that he had been horsed along a couple of times by the White House on proceeding with the development of the Executive Action Capability. And that was a matter of independent recollection,

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 45

TOP SECRET

1 it didn't' depend on anybody else's notes or anybody else's
2 refreshing his recollection.

3 Mr. Bundy. That he didn't say to me, and I have no way
4 of commenting on it.

5 The Chairman. I think we must carefully review the
6 record on that score.

7 Senator Baker. It may be necessary to ask him to come
8 back for that purpose.

9 May I ask a question there?

10 Mr. Bundy, do you have any recollection of any specific
11 covert plans that would involve poisons, hypdermic syringes,
12 or other potentially lethal devices in conjunction with acti-
13 vities against Cuba?

14 Mr. Bundy. I have no recollection of any specific plan.

15 I do have a very vague, essentially refreshed recollection
16 that I heard the word poison at some point in connection with
17 a possibility of action in Cuba. But that is as far as I
18 have been able to take it in my own memory.

19 Senator Baker. Can you remember who may have men-
20 tioned it to you and what the purposes of the poison may have
21 been?

22 Mr. Bundy. Nothing at all about it in detail.

23 Senator Baker. A poison pen?

24 Mr. Bundy. No, some kind of poison about which -- one
25 thing that does stick in my mind is that it seems totally

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

TOP SECRET

1 impractical because it was going to kill a large group of
2 people in a headquarters mess, or something of that sort.

3 Senator Baker. Do you remember whether the plan was
4 declared non-feasible or infeasible by the Department of
5 Defense?

6 Mr. Bundy. No, I have no such recollection.

7 Senator Baker. Do you remember anything about a hypodermic
8 syringe to carry poisons in a ballpoint pen?

9 Mr. Bundy. That is the sort of thing that I was asked
10 the other day, and I said I remember it, and then it seems to
11 me about ten seconds later was that what I was remembering was
12 murder mysteries and nothing related to Cuba. I have no
13 recollection of connecting anything like that to Cuba.

14 Senator Baker. I have another question, but I will
15 wait, if you have something else.

16 The Chairman. Go ahead, sir.

17 Senator Baker. Do you feel that you have a good insight
18 into the relationship between the President and his brother
19 Robert Kennedy in this respect, that is, having to do with
20 Cuba operations, and Robert Kennedy and Richard Helms?

21 Mr. Bundy. I have a pretty good picture of the relation-
22 ship between President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy on Cuba,
23 and on many other things. It is a recollection which grows
24 stronger as the administration goes on, because I got to
25 know them better, and, of course, they got to know me better,

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 47

TOP SECRET

1 and the relationship tends to become closer, my relation with
2 both of them. I had known the President for many, many
3 years, and the Attorney General much more briefly.
4 I do not -have any clear picture of the relationship
5 between the Attorney General and Mr. Helms. My curbstone
6 judgment would have been that it was not close.

7 Senator Baker. Based on your insight, did the Presi-
8 dent delegate to Robert Kennedy substantial aspects of Cuba
9 policy during the period we are speaking of?

10 Mr. Bundy. I wouldn't put it that way, Senator

11 Baker. He certainly counted on the Attorney General to be
12 a kind of gingerman on a great many subjects, of which Cuba
13 and counterinsurgency were the two that came more closely with-
14 in my area of interest.

15 Senator Baker. Counterinsurgency meaning what?

16 Mr. Bundy. Counterinsurgency meaning all those efforts
17 like the Green Berets and organizing to be able to assist
18 countries threatened by Communist subversion internally.

19 Senator Baker. Are you speaking of counterinsurgency
20 as it led to Cuba, or as a general capability?

21 Mr. Bundy. There was a separate committee, the Special
22 Committee on CI, counterinsurgency. And the Attorney General
23 was an active member of that. And I used to see him playing
24 this very important role of poking and prodding, and why can't
25 you do more, and why can't you do better, and why aren't we

2 Senator Baker. Who was on that committee?

3 Mr. Bundy. I am sorry, I can't decide from recollection.

4 General Taylor was again the Chairman, but the membership was

5 different.

6 Senator Baker. Do you have minutes or records of that

7 group?

8 Mr. Schwarz. No.

9 Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request

10 that with Mr. Bundy's assistance after this hearing that we iden-

11 tify as much as we can what that group is, and make a fomral

12 request for documentation.

13 Mr. Aaron. We have reviewed some of that material at

14 the John F. Kennedy Library. It is essentially in fact the

15 group that reviewed paramilitary operations and potential

16 insurgency situations.in a number of countries. There was an

17 insurgency list. It did not seem to relate to the subject

18 we are speaking of here. So we did not request the documents.

19 But we could have gotten them.

20 Senator Baker. Will you do that, please?

21 Is that agreeable, Mr. Chairman?

22 The Chairman. What is your request?

23 Senator Baker. I would like documentation or any records

24 relating to the counterinsurgency group during the period in

25 question.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 49

TOP SECRET

1 The Chairman. Let me suggest that we designate a mem-
2 ber of the committee staff to undertake that review, and
3 report back to the committee.

4 Would that be satisfactory?

5 Senator Baker. That is fine. I just want to know if
6 there is any worthwhile documentation.

7 The Chairman. Yes. Because it may be entirely ancillary
8 to this issue.

9 Senator Baker. Let me ask Mr. Bundy this. Would that
10 group have been important toward American policy during this
11 period?

12 Mr. Bundy. The CI Group?

13 Senator Baker. Yes.

14 Mr. Bundy. I would think only most marginally,

15 Senator Baker, simply because the existence of other groups,
16 the Special Group Augmented or the MONGOOSE Group, was so
17 clearly dominant and was the Central Committee for that sub-
18 ject.

19 Senator Baker. The gingerbread man concept?

20 Mr. Bundy. The gingerman concept.

21 Senator Baker. The gingerman concept. There is a
22 difference.

23 Do I directly infer from that description that the
24 President would authorize Robert Kennedy to urge and expedite
25 action to move from assignment to assignment and to push people

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

TOP SECRET

1 along to produce a result?

2 Mr. Bundy. In a general way that is right. But the

3 form it took in the areas in which I was concerned was in one

4 sense quite informal. I know of no instance where the Attorney

5 General tried to replace the normal channel -- let's stay away

6 for the moment from the covert question and the Cuban ques-

7 tion, which I know you will want to talk about more precisely --

8 but if he felt, as he often did, that American policy in

9 Africa, for example, was insufficiently sensitive to the aspir-

10 ations of black people in Africa, he wouldn't fire off a kick, he

11 would come in and say, why can't you people do something about

12 the State Department on news and stuff.

13 Senator Baker. There is some evidence -- we had direct

14 testimony that Mr. Helms, who was DDP at the time in ques-

15 tion, rather than DCI, clearly thought that the authority of

16 the Agency was to overthrow the Castro regime by any means, in-
cluding assassination.

18 And when pressed on the source of that authority he de-

19 signed to say that anyone specifically told him that, but

20 that he talked to Robert Kennedy frequently about it. Would

21 this be in the gingerman concept you are speaking of?

22 Mr. Bundy. Now we are right at the specific point I

23 would like to make. But everything I knew about Bobby Kennedy

24 when he was goading and spurring people on is that he never

25 took away from the existing channel of authority its authority

1 or responsibility.

2 Senator Baker. Would what I describe be consistent

3 with whatyou describe?

4 Mr. Bundy. Not if it is interpreted as meaning that he

5 was providing a separate channel of authority.

6 Senator Baker. What I meant was just what it was, and

7 that is, Helms described for us meeting with Kennedy apparently

8 to stimulate the Agency's activities to produce the overthrow

9 of the Castro regime, and that he met regularly with Kennedy

10 in this respect.

11 Mr. Bundy. I don't know how often they met or what was

12 said, I know nothing about that. I would have said, just in

13 passing, that the Attorney General's relationship to the Direc-

14 tor of Central Intelligence was much closer and more impor-

15 tant than his relationship to Mr. Helms.

16 Senator Baker. I am correct, am I, that Helms at the

17 time was DDP and not DCI?

18 Mr. Schwarz. That is right.

19 Senator Baker. Do you have any idea why he would have

20 met regularly with the DDP rather than the DCI?

21 Mr. Bundy. I have no idea that he did. I know that he

22 met often and intimately and easily with the Director of

23 Central Intelligence, who was a close personal friend of his.

24 Senator Baker. You are speaking of Mr. McCone?

25 Mr. Bundy. Mr. McCone.

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

TOP SECRET

1 The Chairman. I think that since the point is impor-
2 tant, that when the Committee Staff complete its review of the
3 evidence it ought to be reminded to look closely at that Helms
4 testimony and identify exactly what words Helms might have
5 used to describe his relationship with Robert Kennedy.
6 Senator Baker. And the time involved and what position
7 Helms occupied at the time.

8 The Chairman. I have another question.

9 Mr. Bundy, we also have it from Mr. Bissell that at one
10 time he called in an officer, a subordinate, O'Donnell, --
11 that at one time Mr. Bissell called in a subordinate whose
12 name was Mr. O'Donnell, and asked Mr. O'Donnell if he would
13 be willing to undertake the assassination of Mr. Lumumba.

14 Mr. O'Connell testifies that he said he would not be
15 willing to undertake the assassination of Mr. Lumumba, because
16 he had moral compunctions against killing.

17 Mr. O'Donnell further testifies that he was then or
18 thereafter dispatched to the Congo, where he was informed that
19 some poison had been made available -- had come to the CIA
20 headquarters in the Congo.

21 Mr. Bundy. I am sorry, I missed that last.

22 The Chairman. He was informed that some poison had
23 arrived at the CIA headquarters in the Congo.

24 When we asked Mr. Bissell on what authority he had asked
25 O'Connell as to his willingness to undertake the assassination

1 of Lumumba, he could not provide us with that authority,

2 except to say that he may have done it on his own initiative.

3 Do you have any reaction to that?

4 Mr. Bundy. Where is it in time?

5 Senator Church. It was in the fall of 1960. It was

6 not during the Kennedy Administration, it preceded the Kennedy

7 Administration. But I asked you the question, because it

8 strikes me as being a very disturbing piece of testimony, that

9 any man so positioned, in the CIA could not identify higher

10 authority for such an action, and would under oath say that it

11 might have been on his own initiative.

12 Mr. Bundy. I can't add to your comment on that, Mr.

13 Chairman.

14 The Chairman. Very well.

15 Senator Morgan. Let me ask him a question or two, Mr.

16 Chairman.

17 The Chairman. Senator Morgan?

18 Senator Morgan. Mr. Bundy, you recall very vividly

19 talking with the President on many occasions about Cuba,

20 is that right?

21 Mr. Bundy. I recall vividly that I talked to him on many

22 occasions, I am not very good on remembering specific dis-

23 cussions.

24 Senator Morgan. You told us a few minutes ago that he was

25 constantly prodding, and why don't you do this, and why doesn't

1 so and so work?

2 Mr. Bundy. If I may correct that, I said he prodded me

3 from time to time, not all the time.

4 Senator Morgan. Quite frequently?

5 Mr. Bundy. I wouldn't put it that often. It might have

6 been three or four times.

7 Senator Morgan. Mr. Bundy, you were head of the Security

8 Council, you were his assistant?

9 Mr. Bundy. I am trying to give an accurate picture of

10 the number of times, Senator.

11 Senator Morgan. You are trying to give such an accurate

12 picture that you are not giving much of a picture at all.

13 Are you telling this committee that throughout the time

14 you assumed your duties, throughout the Cuban crisis, and all

15 the MONGOOSE operations, that you might have talked to him two

16 or three times about it?

17 Mr. Bundy. No.

18 Could I separate and try and clarify my answer?

19 Senator Morgan. Yes.

20 Mr. Bundy. I talked to the President, I suppose, many,

21 many times in the context of the events that led up to and

22 followed the Bay of Pigs. I talked to him dozens of times,

23 maybe even hundreds of times, in the context of the events that

24 led up to and followed the Cuban missile crisis. Those are the

25 two great moments of Presidential concern over Cuba during the

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

52

1 time I was in Washington. I talked to him much less -- I can't

2 give you a number-- on these intervening matters. And that is

3 the distinction I am trying to make.

4 Senator Morgan. You were something between himself and

5 the National Security Council, were you not?

6 Mr. Bundy. That isn't exactly the way it works.

7 Senator Morgan. Just tell me what did you do.

8 Mr. Bundy. I am trying to.

9 Senator Morgan. I have been listening all morning, Mr.

10 Bundy, and I just don't get it.

11 Let me go to one other question. Was it true a while

12 ago when you said that Robert Kennedy was constantly prodding

13 people? Why can't we do more?

14 Mr. Bundy. Yes, that is certainly true.

15 Senator Morgan. I have no other questions.

16 Senator Mondale. Could I ask one, Mr. Chairman?

17 The Chairman. Senator Mondale.

18 Senator Mondale. I don't like to ask this question,

19 but I think it is important.

20 Have you talked to others involved during this period

21 when you may have been testifying before us and before the

22 Rockefeller Commission, say, in the last five months about

23 this testimony?

24 Mr. Bundy. I answered that question. Yes, I have.

25 Senator Mondale. Would you repeat it briefly for us?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Smothers. I was about to pursue that line,

2 Senator Mondale.

3 Senator Mondale. Go ahead.

4 Mr. Smothers. I believe you indicated previously, Mr.

5 Bundy, that you talked to Mr. Bissell, Mr. McNamara, Mr. McCone,

6 Mr. Rostow, Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Schleinger, and others that may

7 not be on that list. And you indicated that you had spoken to

8 Mr. Bissell after his testimony regarding executive action.

9 Mr. Bundy. That is right.

10 Mr. Smothers. Had you spoken with him also before that

11 testimony?

12 Mr. Bundy. No.

13 Mr. Smothers. Did he call you or did you call him?

14 Mr. Bundy. I don't honestly recall. I think I said the
other day that he had called me, but I think actually what

16 happened that he called me, and my first words were, I needed

17 to call you.

18 Mr. Smothers. Can we go to your conversations with Mr.

19 McNamara. When did you first talk with him about these matters

20 being testified to?

21 Mr. Bundy. I think pretty much as soon as it hit the papers.

22 Mr. Smothers. Can you give the Committee the sense of

23 your conversations with Mr. McNamara?

24 Mr. Bundy. There have been a number of them. Mr.

25 McNamara and I not only have been close friends, but are very

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

1 closely associated now. So, I see him and talk with him fre-
quently, both about substance of matters of international
development, and about the business of the Ford Foundation.

So, I have talked to him a number of times both on the
telephone and face to face. The essence of the conversation
is the exploration of questions raised or doubts raised babout
the conviction we both share, which is that no one in the Kennedy
Administration, in the White House, or in the Capitol, ever
gave any authorization, approval, or instruction of any kind
for any effort to assassinate anyone by the CIA.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Smothers. Did you discuss with him, or did he raise

2 with you specifically, the fact that he had received from

3 Mr. McCone a memorandum from Mr. McCone in 19677

4 Mr. Bundy. Yes, he told me that.

5 Mr. Smothers. Did you discuss the substance of that

6 memorandum?

7 Mr. Bundy. I discussed it initially with Mr. McCone.

8 Mr. Smothers. Did you discuss it with Mr. McNamara?

9 Mr. Bundy. He mentioned it to me. I don't recall much

10 about it.

11 Mr. Smothers. Did you discuss the meeting of August 10

12 in Secretary Rusk's office?

13 Mr. Bundy. That was the first discussed because the

14 newspapers said that there had been a meeting of three, four

15 or five of us, and the question was whether there had been

16 such a meeting limited to three, four, or five. And we were able

17 to satisfy ourselves that that was wrong.

18 Mr. Smothers. That was wrong. What do you recall to

19 have been Mr. McNamara's reaction of the August 10 meeting?

20 Mr. Bundy. He didn't seem to have any that I can recall,

21 at least I don't recall that he told me of any reaction of

22 it.

23 Mr. Smothers. Do you recall the substance of his

24 comment regarding the 1967 McCone report?

25 Mr. Bundy. No. I don't think he commented on it. He

1 told me what it said.

2 Mr. Smothers. With regard to your conversation with

3 Mr. McCone, when did this occur, approximately?

4 Mr. Bundy. That occurred earlieron.

5 Mr. Smothers. Before the Rockefeller Commission inquiry?

6 Mr. Bundy. I don't know exactly when it was. But it

7 was within the context of the Rockefeller Commission

8 inquiry and not this inquiry.

9 Mr. Smothers. Are you talking about more than one

10 conversation?

11 Mr. Bundy. No, I think I talked to him on the phone

12 and then I had a meeting with him.

13 Mr. Smothers. In either the phone conversation or the

14 meeting did you discuss Mr. McCone's 1967 report?

15 Mr. Bundy. He told me that he had heard of it. I don't

16 think he had then seen it.

17 Mr. Smothers. You don't think he had then seen it?

18 Mr. Bundy. He had then seen it as of 1975. He obviously

19 saw it in 1967.

20 Mr. Smothers. Can you give us a feeling for the approx-

21 imate time when this conversation occurred?

22 Mr. Bundy. I could probably work it out from my own

23 calendar, but I don't have it in my head.

24 Mr. Smothers. But at this time he had not seen the

25 report?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Bundy. He had not seen the report in 1975. But
2 since it is a report that as I understand it, it is a
3 report that he made in 1967, and he had seen it then.

4 Mr. Smothers. Did he indicate to you that he was.
5 makinggan effort to get that report?

6 Mr. Bundy. I think he told me that he had been in touch
7 with the Agency and would be seeing the report, but I don't
8 really recall.

9 Mr. Smothers. To go into your conversation with Mr.
10 Rostow, would you indicate to the Committee, please, the
11 substance of that conversation?

12 Mr. Bundy. Yes. I called him after my conversation
13 with Mr. Bissell, because it seemed to me that he ought to
14 be informed, and the two of them ought to talke with each
15 other about that testimony.

16 Mr. Smothers. At the time you called him it was your
17 impression that Mr. Bissell had not talked with Mr. Rostow?

18 Mr. Bundy. But was planning to.

19 Mr. Smothers. And this was after Mr. Bissell's testi-
20 mony?

21 Mr. Bundy. That if right.

22 Mr. Smothers. Did you and Mr. Rostow discuss the fact
23 that both you and Mr. Rostow had been named as potential
24 sources for the Exective Action authorization?

25 Mr. Bundy. My emphasis in talking about Mr. Rostow was

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 61

TOP SECRET

1 the fact that he had been mentioned, because it seemed to me
2 that in my recollection that must be wrong, and he would be
3 interested in getting it straightened out.

4 Mr. Smothers. Can we go to your conversation with Mr.
5 Goodwin. Did you call him or did he call you?

6 Mr. Bundy. I called him.

7 Mr. Smothers. And the nature of that conversation?

8 Mr. Bundy. That conversation was about the Dominican
9 Republic, because of my complete failure of recollection as
10 to who or what the White House line of action, responsibility
11 and concern was with respect to the Dominican Republic in
12 1961. And I called him, and I called Dungan, and I called
13 Schlesinger, because they were the the who had been very
14 much involved in things like the Alliance for Progress, and
15 new appointments to embassies in Latin America, and Latin
16 American Policy generally, except for the Bay of Pigs. And
17 I wanted to see if they had recollections about events in.
18 that spring that were more extensive than mine. I didn't learn
19 very much, but that was the purpose of the call.

20 Mr. Smothers. And it it your testimony that your first
21 exposure to the documentary evidence beyond these recollections
22 was when either the Rockefeller Commission staff or this
23 staff showed you documents pertaining to this inquiry.

24 Mr. Bundy. I want to be precise about the Rockefeller
25 Commission staff. They did not show me the documents, the

2 Mr. Smothers. The White House Staff showed you the

6 Staff provide these documents to you? Was it at your request,

7 or their request?

8 Mr. Bundy. My request.

9 Mr. Smothers. When did it occur?

10 Mr. Bundy. At the time of the Rockefeller hearings.

11 Mr. Smothers. At the time of the Rockefeller hearings?

12 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

13 Mr. Smothers. And prior to your testimony?

14 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

15 Mr. Smothers. Who provided these documents to you?

16 Mr. Bundy. I never have testified on -- this is not a

17 serious matter, because there is no secret about it. But I

18 have always taken the position that White House decisions

19 are for the White House to discuss, and I perfer to hold to

20 that position now.

21 Mr. Smothers. Are you saying that you do not feel at

22 liberty --

23 Mr. Bundy. No, I am not saying, I am saying that I would

24 request the committee to address that question with the White

25 House.

2 Mr. Smothers. The question is who in the White House provided Mr. Bundy with documents relevant to this investigation. And I believe his position is that he would prefer not to disclose that matter, or that that is a matter for the Committee's determination.

7 Mr. Bundy. Let me explain, Mr. Chairman, because you were out of the room, that I have always taken the position that decisions of the White House are for the White House to discuss. I always asked permission to see documentation and permission was given. I looked at the document, but I would rather not discuss it, because I think it is for the White House to discuss it.

13 The Chairman. What is the document?

15 Mr. Bundy. I just described it, it is National Security Action Memorandum No. 1, we showed us the National Security Action file, which I believe your staff has.

18 Mr. Schwarz. We have it here.

19 Mr. Smothers. My question was, who had the request been made to, and showed him the document?

21 Mr. Bundy. My point is that I have tried historically not to discuss this kind of question when it is something that concerns the White House, but to leave it to the White House to discuss it, and I would prefer to hold to that position.

(Off the record.)

Mr. Smothers. This quite frankly, Mr. Bundy, this related to an ancillary matter that is of concern to the Committee.

You mentioned conversations with Mr. Schlesinger. Again, were those initiated by you?

Mr. Bundy. The most recent one, he called me. And I think there were earlier ones, but I don't know. I can't be precise. I must say I don't know that I understand the line of questioning. These are very important matters, and people closely involved in them should be trying to get a clear sense of what each other remembers after this many years, it seems to me this would be entirely natural.

Mr. Smothers. I don't question the fact that it is natural, Mr. Bundy. I think one of the difficult things for this Committee to do is to separate out, if you will, the independent recollections from the documentary evidence we have shown you, and from conversations with others --

Mr. Bundy. You are quite right. And I have tried quite carefully to teil you my recollection.

Mr. Smothers. We are merely trying now to establish those relationships so that when we get the point in the record there is some question regarding the nature of the recollection that might be of some assistance to us. That is not an attack on your veracity, it is not an attempt to

1 see if there has been any effort at collusion or whatever,
2 but merely to give us some guidelines in looking at the
3 record.

4 Do you recall, Mr. Bundy, from these conversations that
5 we have just mentioned, any matters which have been raised
6 by the participants that may be inconsistent with the
7 documentary record as you have seen it? We know, of course,
8 that Mr. McNamara's recollection appears to be inconsistent
9 with the documentary evidence regarding the August 10
10 meeting.

11 Mr. Bundy. Well, so was mine. And I have no such
12 recollection.

13 Mr. Smothers. I am speaking. now of the recollection of
14 others, if you will.

15 Mr. Bundy. I can't really recite on that, because I
16 haven't made the kind of comparison document by document
17 and conversation by conversation that would allow me to make
18 a clearcut and comprehensive answer. But I don't have any
19 recollection of sharp divergency of that sort.

20 The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz.

21 Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bundy, I want to pick up on one
thing that you testified to that was left hanging and then
22 come back through your involvement with Cuba and starting
23 from the beginning. You testified that to your knowledge
24 no authorization for an assassination was given. I want to

1 come at the subject from another direction. Were you ever

2 told at any time by anybody that assassination efforts were

3 actually under way with respect to Mr. Castro?

4 Mr. Bundy. Absolutely not.

5 Mr. Schwarz. Were you ever told by anybody that the

6 Central Intelligence Agency had hired the Mafia to assassinate

7 Castro?

8 Mr. Bundy. No.

9 Mr. Schwarz. Were you ever told by anybody that during

10 the MONGOOSE program Mr. Harvey was engaged in assassination

11 efforts upon Fidel Castro?

12 Mr. Bundy. No.

13 Mr. Schwarz. Were you ever told by anybody that in the

14 fall of 1963 the Central Intelligence Agency was passing

15 assassination devices to a Cuban military officer?

16 Mr. Bundy. No.

17 Mr. Schwarz. Were you ever told by anybody that in the

18 fall of 1963 the Central Intelligence Agency was engaged in

19 an assassination effort with respect to Fidel Castro?

20 Mr. Bundy. No.

21 Mr. Schwarz. Now, after the Bay of Pigs, was there a

22 reevaluation or reconsideration of what the policy toward Cuba

23 should be? And would you turn in that connection to Tab B,

3 inaccurate, because I don't think we have anything that
4 indicates that we contacted the syndicate as such, and I think
5 if we use, "individuals likely associated with the Mafia,"
6 or something like that -- it is a little technical.

7 Mr. Schwarz. Let me restate the question to make sure
8 that there is not a problem with the scope of my question.
9 And Senator Tower is correct.

10 Were you ever told that the Agency had contacted a man
11 called John Roselli?

TOP SECRET

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bundy, based upon your having had an opportunity prior to the testimony, and now again if you seek to do so, to refresh your recollection, will you recount for the Committee what happened in the summer of 1964 in connection with this matter?

Mr. Bundy. Well, it is a relatively small matter in the context of what you are discussing, but what happened in the summer of 1964 was that it came to our attention that there were relations between Cuban refugees in Cuba and people apparently associated with the Mafia. And this did not seem to be a good idea. And this was in a period in which sentiment had been steadily growing for some time against activities by Cuban refugees that were wholly outside the control and not really in the interest of the U.S., and that they should be associated with a criminal group.

And so when the matter came to the Special Group, the decision was made to refer it to the Department of Justice as a matter of internal American law enforcement. That was done.

And the Department said that it was going after the matter, which it then did, and reported back.

The reports don't give any conclusive picture of what really was going on, but they do show that the Bureau went to a number of people asking around about these matters, and as far as I know, it then faded away.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

1 Mr. Schwarz. In the context of that discussion did
2 anybody from the Central Intelligence Agency or anybody
3 else inform you that in earlier years there had been
4 a relationship with -- to use Senator Tower's caution --
5 with persons alledgedly involved with the criminal syndicate
6 in order to accomplish the assassination of Fidel Castor?

7 Mr. Bundy. No.

8 Mr. Schwarz. Now, going back to the post-Bay of Pigs
9 period, would you put before the witness and mark as Exhibit
10 2 the National Security minutes of a meeting held May 5, 1961.
11 It is at Tab B of the Senator's Book 1 of 2. This reflects,
12 am I correct, Mr. Bundy, a discussion of Cuba, held with the
13 President and high officials of the government who are all
14 listed on the front page?

15 Mr. Bundy. Correct.

16 Mr. Schwarz. And Cuba was discussed, and it was
17 agreed, following the discussion that U.S. policy toward Cuba
18 should aim at the downfall of Castro, and that since the
19 measures agreed below are not likely to achieve this end,
20 the matter should be reviewed at intervals with a view to
21 further action?

22 Mr. Bundy. Right.

23 Mr. Schwarz. Now, can you describe the measures agreed
24 to at that point?

25 Mr. Bundy. My only way of doing that with any accuracy

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

TOP SECRET

1 is to in effect to quote from or summarize this document,

2 Mr. Schwarz.

3 Mr. Schwarz. The document speaks for itself, then. And

4 you can add nothing to it?

5 Mr. Bundy. No.

6 Mr. Schwarz. But can you say that the measures did or

7 did not include assassination?

8 Mr. Bundy. There is nothing in my recollection and
9 nothing in the document that seems to me to imply assassin-

10 ation.

11 Mr. Schwarz. Now, following this instruction, was

12 Cuban policy reviewed again in the fall of 1961?

13 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

14 Mr. Schwarz. And ultimately out of the fall review

15 in 1961 came the so-called MONGOOSE program; is that correct?

16 Mr. Bundy. That is right.

17 Mr. Schwarz. Now, prior to discussing upon the MONGOOSE

18 program, did you consider a lot of other options?

19 Mr. Bundy. I think we were -- and this is a hard

20 question, but I think what we were doing was working toward

21 an organization that would be able to take charge of the

22 complicated, varied inter-departmental kinds of things involved

23 in Cuba. We have been concentrating this morning on covert

24 actions, but there were also propaganda problems, economic

25 problems, and Cuban refugee problems in Miami, and a number

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 76

1 of others that did not all fall within one jurisdiction.

2 Anytime you get that kind of problem you have an organization

3 problem. And the solution of 1961, which took sometime to

4 work out, as the passage of time suggests, was the creation

5 of a Special Committee under the Chairmanship of General

6 Taylor and with General Lansdale as its operating officer.

7 Mr. Schwarz. Now, in the course of the review that did

8 take place prior to the establishment of that Special Committee

9 which then got called the MONGOOSE program, was one of the

10 matters which was considered the assassination of Mr. Castro?

11 Mr. Bundy. As I have already said, I can not tell you

12 that this question never came up. But I recall no sustained

13 discussion of that matter in that period.

14 Mr. Schwarz. Whether you recall a sustained discussion

15 or not --

16 Mr. Bundy. I don't recall a discussion that I can pin-

17 point anywhere, but over the period of 1961 to 1963 the

18 subject was mentioned from time to time by different individ-

19 uals, never to me that I can recall by the President. But

20 it did come up'.

21 Mr. Schwarz. And it may have come up in this period in

22 the fall of 1961 as something to consider, is that correct?

23 Mr. Bundy. As something to talk about rather than to

24 consider, would be my answer.

25 Mr. Schwarz. Would you put before the witness as Bundy

1 Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bundy, to summarize -- before I ask
2 you the question -- in NSAM No. 100 you sent to the Secretary
3 of State the following note: "In conformation of oral
4 instructions conveyed to Assistant Secretary of State
5 Woodward, a plan is desired to the indicated contingency in
6 Cuba". Do you have an independent recollection of what that
7 indicated contingency was?

8 Mr. Bundy. Before seeing this document?

9 Mr. Schwarz. Before seeing the documents.

10 Mr. Bundy. No.

11 Mr. Schwarz. Having looked at not only Exhibit 3, but
12 Exhibit 3A and 3B, do you agree that the contingency referred
13 to in 3A and the contingency referred to in 3B are related
14 to NSAM No. 100?

15 Mr. Bundy. Yes, I do.

16 Mr. Schwarz. Now, the contingency referred to in 3B,
17 which is the earlier of the two following documents, is
18 said by Mr. Parrott to be a plan against the contingency that
19 Castro would in some way or other be removed from the Cuban
20 scent. And I am going to come to some of the other parts
21 of that document with respect to the President's interest or
22 not.

23 And the contingency in 3A, which is the minutes of the
24 Special Group, as characterized as follows: "Mr. Parrott also
25 told the Group that two other exercises are in progress in

1   connection with Cuba, the preparation of a contingency plan
2   in connection with the possible removal of Castro from the
3   Cuban scene, and an updating of the overall plan for
4   covert operations".

5   Now, after having reviewed those documents, and in the
6   light of your testimony that it is possible that the
7   consideration of the possibility of assassination which you
8   say did occur at some point, occurred in the fall of 1961,
9   do you agree that at that time the contingency under consider-
10  ation here was the possibility of the assassination of Castro?

11  Mr. Bundy. No, I would put it another way. The contin-
12  gency here is, what would we do if Castro were no longer
13  there. So that the question of how Castro ceased to be
14  there is left out of this set of papers. Clearly one of
15  the possibilities would be assassination, but only one of
16  them. What we are talking about here, as I read the docu-
17  ments, is a plan against the contingency that I am not reading
18  from the Parrott memorandum, against the contingency that
19  Castro would in some way or other be removed from the Cuban
20  scene. NSAM 100, whose language is indirect, nonetheless
21  indicates, to me at least, rereading it, that the President
22  wanted to know what was likely to happen if Castro were no
23  longer there. He was, in other words, trying to get a picture
24  of whether that would really change things, and if so, in
25  what way.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 81

TOP SECRET

78

1 Mr. Schwarz. Just one detail that Mr. Smothers suggested

2 to me. Is NSAM 100 what the White House showed you, or is

3 it another document?

4 Mr. Bundy. No, 181. But let me be precise. I asked

5 to see the documents relating to -- from the National Security

6 files relating to August 1962. And they gave me the NSAM

7 file identified as the significant memorandum, NSAM 181.

8 Mr. Schwarz. Now, the contingency to be examined,

9 therefore, was what would happen -- would it help the U.S.,

10 that is the question, if Castro were to disappear?

11 Mr. Bundy. What would it be like if Castro were to

12 disappear? The question is open ended.

13 Mr. Schwarz. What was the conclusion?

14 Mr. Bundy. I don't remember. My unaided sense of the

15 matter is that intelligent political analysis would have

16 suggested in 1961 or at any time later that the removal of a

17 single individual in a revolution complex and general as this

18 would have quite unpredictable and not necessarily helpful

19 effects.

20 Mr. Schwarz. You said that while you were clear the

21 assassination was not in fact authorized, you believe that

22 at some point it was examined, is that a fair characterization.

23 Mr. Bundy. That isn't the word I used. Talk about.

24 Mr. Schwarz. Talk about. And this exercise constitutes

25 an analysis of what Cuba/the U.S. would be like if Castro were

TOP SECRET

79

1 removed.

2 Mr. Bundy. It constitutes a request for such an analysis.

3 Mr. Schwarz. Was the analysis made?

4 Mr. Bundy. I don't have any recollection.

5 Mr. Schwarz. If one were exploring the possibility of

6 assassination, I take it this kind of analysis is the sort

7 of analysis one would wish to make if one was not simply

8 ruling assassination out as a matter of principle in the first

9 instance.

10 Mr. Bundy. Let me put it another way. If people were

11 suggesting this to you, and you were curious about whether

12 it was worth exploring, one way of getting more light on it

13 without going any further with that notion itself would be

14 to ask political people, not intelligence people, what they

15 thought would happen if Castro were not there any longer.

16 You will notice that this National Security Action

17 Memorandum is not addressed to the Central Intelligence

18 Agency, less still to the covert part of the Agency, but

19 rather to the Secretary of State. And specifically clearly

20 the action of certain is Assistant Secretary Woodward.

21 Mr. Schwarz. Now, document 3B indicates -- and you

22 have had an opportunity to review this one before, I think --

23 Mr. Bundy. Which one are we now talking about?

24 Mr. Schwarz. 3B, Mr. Parrott's memo.

1 yesterday, for which I am grateful.

2 Mr. Schwarz. It indicates that there was a Presidential

3 interest in the matter. And then General Taylor told Mr.

4 Parrott that he prefered that the State Department, or Mr.

5 Woodward in the State Department, not be told about the

6 Presidential interest in the matter. First, was there a

7 Presidential interest in the matter? You have no reason to

8 doubt that there was, I take it.

9 Mr. Bundy. I am sorry, I was reading a note, and I

10 didn't hear the last part of the question.

11 Mr. Schwarz. I asked really two questions, the first

12 of which is a direct question, was there a Presidential

13 interest in the matter?

14 Mr. Bundy. There was a Presidential -- there was no

15 doubt in my mind that when I write in a National Security

16 Action Memorandum a plan as desired, that the desire is not

17 mine.

18 Mr. Schwarz. And the desire is in fact the Presidents?

19 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

20 Mr. Schwarz. Now, have you any other recollection of

21 calling your attention to the fall of 1969?

22 Mr. Bundy. Could I go back and comment on your earlier

23 question.

24 You correctly pointed out that there was concern to

25 keep the President's name out of this process of request,

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 84

TOP SECRET

1 although you correctly point out that the President was the
2 one who wanted to know.. My impression here is that whatever
3 concern we have, General Taylor or I, in the frame of this
4 language, it was precisely to insulate the President from
5 any false inference that what he was asking about was
6 assassination. It is easy to confuse the question. What
7 are things going to be like after Castro, with the other
8 question, and we were trying to focus attention on the
9 information he obviously wanted, which is, what would happen
10 if we did do this sort of thing, and not get one into the
11 frame of mind of thinking that he was considering doing it.
12 That is the distinction, I think.

13 Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any further recollection of
14 discussion of this matter in this fall of 1961? And by this
15 matter I mean either the broader inquiry into what it would
16 be like if Castro disappeared, or a scenario arising of the
17 specific subject of assassination.

18 Mr. Bundy. No, I don't.

19 Mr. Schwarz. Had you ever heard before I asked you
20 about the last night about a conversation, an alledged conver-
21 sation, between the President and the Journalist Theodore
22 Schwartz, and or Mr. Goodwin in this timeframe?

23 Mr. Bundy? I saw that in the newspapers.

24 Mr. Schwarz. Or in Esquire magazine?

25 Mr. Bundy. Wherever I saw it, I saw it in print.

1 Mr. Schwarz. But you have no independent recollection
of that or of the fact that Mr. Schultz met with the President?

2 Mr. Bundy. No. But I will say this -- and it is a random

3 observation -- if I were planning an action of great sensitivity

4 I wouldn't discuss it with any journalist, I don't think.

5 Mr. Schwarz. The record from Mr. Schwartz is that the

6 President said he was opposed to assassination, but that he

7 brought it up in a conversation with Mr. Schwartz, saying

8 that he was being encouraged to order assassination.

9 Now, you have said that you do recall that the subject

10 was talked about, your words, at some point, and that it

11 might have been in the fall of 1961.

12 Mr. Bundy. I wouldn't want to say that it was only in

13 any given period.

14 Mr. Schwarz. But that one of the points in which it

15 might have been discussed was the fall of 1961.

16 Mr. Bundy. Certainly.

17 Mr. Schwarz. We are going to come to another period

18 which relates to you.

19 Mr. Bundy. May I interrupt one second.

20 Could we go off the record for a moment?

Mr. Bundy. Going back to your earlier, question, I have a message through the courtesy of the Committee from the White House that there is no objection to answering the question as to how the White House came to show me the NSC file. When I learned of some of the interests of the Rockefeller Commission, it seemed to me that it would be useful if I could refresh my recollection. I telephoned Dr. Kissinger, who it seemed to me would be the right person both in his capacity as Special Assistant and the capacity as Secretary of State, and he called me back to say that General Scocroft would show me the documents I needed, and he did not.

Mr. Smothers. Just one question.

This file contained what, now, other than the NSAM?

Mr. Bundy. The only file that I had time to go through that I can recollect was the NSAM file, which is a relatively short one.

Mr. Smothers. For which time period?

Mr. Bundy. For the period surrounding August 1962.

Mr. Smothers. It was given to us as an existing file, or matters that had been pulled, or organized

Mr. Bundy. No, they gave me the whole file, they were all documents that I have been involved with, it was nothing new to me. But the ones I was looking for were the ones relating to this subject.

Mr. Smothers. Were these only your documents?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 87

Mr. Bundy. As far as I recollect.

Mr. Smothers. And by your documents, I mean documents signed by you?

Mr. Bundy. They wouldn't be all signed by me, not every NSMA was signed by me. But they would all be documents for which I had responsibility.

Mr. Smothers. And the timeframe was --

Mr. Bundy. Sufficiently before and after to give me a picture of the political context of August 1962 in relation to Cuba.

Mr. Smothers. And do you recall when you saw this file?

Mr. Bundy. Well, as I say, it was in the context of my appearance before the Rockeferrer Commission. And that would be early this year. I don't have the dates, and I don't want to make a mistake on it.

Mr. Smothers. I am not trying to pin the date down. It would be helpful if you remember. But we can ask.

Mr. Schwarz.

Mr. Schwarz. I want to make sure that we have what we have done so for accurately summarized, and that you agree with it.

Can I use discussion of an assassination, will you accept that?

Mr. Bundy. It implies more seriousness and more sustained argument than I recollect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 88

TOP SECRET

Mr. Schwarz. So your records are, with respect to
persons asking about---

Mr. Bundy. Or talking about.

Mr. Schwarz. -- or talking about assassination, that
did occur, that it probably occurred on more than one occasion?

Mr. Bundy. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And that one of the occasions may have
been in the fall of 1961?

Mr. Bundy. What I recollect about the fall of 1961 is
this question, what would happen if he is not there?

Mr. Schwarz. Which would be a relevant question to ask
if one was talking about assassination.

Mr. Bundy. Yes. But I have no independent recollection
of talks about assassination, Mr. Schwarz, and I musn't lead
you by saying that I did.

Mr. Schwarz. In any event, passing from talking about or
discussions or contingencies, to authorizations for action,
and specifically focusing on this concrete period, was
assassination authorized in the fall of 1961?

Mr. Bundy. Absolutely not.

Mr. Schwarz. In fact what was authorized in the fall of
1961?

Mr. Bundy. Well, we have a long document on that, I
think.

Mr. Schwarz. And that is the MONGOOSE program?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 89

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Bundy. And that is the MONGOOSE programs. 86
2 Mr. Schwarz. In connection with the MONGOOSE program,
3 you had some dialogue about the Attorney General which was
4 quite extensive. Let me ask you one additional question on
5 that subject. What was the relationship personally and pro-
6 fessionally between the Attorney General and General Maxwell
7 Taylor?

8 Mr. Bundy. It was very close. I think that they first
9 met in a hardworking sense when they were -- I think they
10 were both members of the committee to look into what happened
11 after the Bay of Pigs, or if the Attorney General was not
12 a member he was certainly closely interested.

13 Mr. Schwarz. He was a member.

14 Mr. Bundy. And I am sure the Attorney General was
15 one of the people strongly favoring the appointment of General
16 Taylor as the President's military advisor. They were both
17 active and ardent tennis players, they liked each other, and
18 they visited back and forth. One of the Kennedy children
19 is named for General Taylor, I think. There was a relation of
20 real trust and confidence between them. And the measure of
21 its strength is that I think it easily survived later very
22 shart differences over Vietnam.

23 Mr. Schwarz. Now recognizing that, what I am asking for
24 you is a matter of opinion and not a fact, given your under-
25 standing of that relationship, will you give us your opinion

1 the likelihood that Robert Kennedy, in the face of Maxwell
2 Taylor's Chairmanship of the Special Group Augmented -- was
3 Maxwell Taylor understood to be the Chairman of the Special
4 Group Augmented?
5 Mr. Bundy. It certainly is my understanding.
6 Mr. Schwarz. Would Robert Kennedy in your opinion,
7 in the fact of Maxwell Taylor's Chairmanship of the Special
8 Group Augmented, have developed a bach-channel relationship
9 with someone else for the purpose of assassinating Fidel
10 Castro?
11 Mr. Bundy. No.
12 Mr. Schwarz. Now, in connection with MONGOOSE, you were
13 a member of the Special Group Augmented, were you?
14 Mr. Bundy. I was. I wasn't its most faithful attender,
15 but I was a member.
16 Mr. Schwarz. To the extent that you didattend, would
17 you describe the nature of the meetings, what kind of items
18 were brought before you, what was the process for decision
19 making?
20 Mr. Bundy. It is very difficult to do that without
21 documentary reconstruction. But in the broadest sense, I
22 think I can do it. The kinds of things would be Cuban exiles,
23 training them, how united are they, whose the leader, and
24 what kind of operations against the island are we able to
25 mount, specific proposals, just because I have seen it in

1 the last two or three days -- I saw a sabotage program which
2 involved, I think, oil facilities, transportation facilities,
3 and a couple of other categories -- exfiltration was a
4 frequent problem. I don't recall that we worried so much
5 about getting the agents in, but there seems always to be
6 a great problem about getting them out. And that sort of
7 thing that I mentioned, propaganda, there was the one island
8 enterprise -- was Florida doing much good, and how much
9 does it cost and things of that sort.

10 Mr. Schwarz. At any MONGOOSE meeting did Mr. Harvey
11 state that he had taken steps to assassinate Fidel Castro?

12 Mr. Bundy. I never heard anything from Mr. Harvey in
13 any context in any meeting at any time on that subject.

14 Mr. Schwarz. And it was clear that the President was
15 the person basically in control, perhaps not of the details,
16 but of the general program; is that right?

17 Mr. Bundy. The President had worked it. The day to
18 day operations where in the hands of different departments
19 for different categories of programs. The coordinator was
20 General Lansdale, and the Chairman of the Committee was General
21 Taylor.

22 Mr. Schwarz. Would you turn to Lansdale Tab 38, please?
23 Where is the August 8 document that transmits the new
24 guidelines for MONGOOSE?

25 Mr. Kelley. That is Lansdale Tab 20.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 92

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Schwarz. The new guidelines, I mean the August

2 guidelines.

3 Mr. Kelley. 38.

4 Mr. Schwarz. 38A.

5 Was there a change in or about August between what was

6 characterized as Phase I of Operation MONGOOSE and a step-up

7 activities under the MONGOOSE?

8 Mr. Bundy. It appeared to be so from the documents I have

9 been reviewing. I couldn't give you an independent recollection

10 on that point.

11 Mr. Schwarz. You have got no reason to doubt that there

12 was some step-up commencing in August?

13 Mr. Bundy. I think that sounds reasonable. I just

14 don't have any expertise other than as a reader many years

15 later.

16 Mr. Schwarz. Now, with respect to the August 10 meeting,

17 you have previously testified - I am not sure you have --

18 do you recall the subject of assassinations being brought up?

19 Mr. Bundy. In the August 10 meeting? No.

20 Mr. Schwarz. Specifically, do you recall Mr. McNamara

21 ever bringing the subject of assassinations up?

22 Mr. Bundy. No.

23 Mr. Schwarz. We have shown you notes of Mr. Harvey on

24 August 14, and General Lansdale's memorandum of August 13

25 that refers to the liquidation of leaders and certain things

2 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

3 Mr. Schwarz. Do they refresh your recollection?

4 Mr. Bundy. No. They give me no -- they do not persuade me. I simply don't from that suddenly have any flash, so and

5 so said that, not at all.

6 Mr. Schwarz. But you don't have any reason to question

7 them, you just don't have a recollection, is that fair?

8 Mr. Bundy. I simply tell you that I was in a large meeting in which a great many subjects were discussed, and

9 I have no recollection of that.

10 Mr. Schwarz. I will pass around Mr. Bundy's notes from the meeting. If someone thinks they should be marked we can

11 do that.

12 Mr. Bundy. If the Committee is feeling charitable I hope they may not go into them.

13 Mr. Schwarz. I don't think they will, but I thought we would pass them around in case they were.

14 The Chairman. Let the Senators see them.

15 Mr. Schwarz. We will make one observation, though. Both

16 Mr. Rusk's calendar and Mr. Bundy's notes do not indicate

17 Mr. Lansdale's being present at the meeting, although the minutes of the meeting do. And I take it you have no

18 independent. recollection of whether or not he was not there.

19 Mr. Bundy. I have no objection to entering anything in

2 relevant. It simply illustrates what the hand will do

3 while the mind is elsewhere.

4 The Chairman. Can you identify what you meant by the

5 words, "Worms who were opposing".

6 Mr. Bundy. "Worms" was a Cuban word, gusanos, and it

7 was their own word for themselves, Cubans in opposition to

8 Castor.

10 Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bundy, would you mark with a B your

The Chairman. Going back to the doodle sheet, the
last item in your handwritten underlined -- do you have this?

Mr. Bundy. The Lansdale concept?

The Chairman. Is that concept?

Mr. Bundy. Concept. I don't wonder you ask.

The Chairman. Do you recall what you meant by that?

Mr. Bundy. My guess -- and this is a reconstruction
really -- is that that has to do with the Lansdale plan which
we were referring to a minute ago, his long memorandum of
August 8, outlining all the things that might now be done
under the MONGOOSE.

Mr. Smothers. Would that have been planned plus?

Mr. Bundy. We argue about plans -- this is again
reconstruction -- and I think I saw it in some discussion --
we argued about plans A and B and C, and settled on so-called
B Plus, which I hope you have for the record, because that
would show what the decision was.

Mr. Schwarz. We do have it.

The Chairman. This was the 10th day of August 1962. And
that was about the time that some concern was given to be
expressed as to the possibility that the Russians were moving
into Cuba -- moving missiles into Cuba. You have on the
memorandum, I think, "USSR will put missiles". Do you recall
what you meant by that?

Mr. Bundy. I think what that is, a hand following

1 Mr. Schwarz. Do you have that in front of you, Mr.

2 Bundy?

3 Mr. Bundy. Yes, I have.

4 Mr. Schwarz. This reflects a number of options or

5 study that the President called for in the light of the

6 evidence of new block activities in Cuba. Was that evidence

7 connected with the missiles?

8 Mr. Bundy. Well, there was quite a buildup reported

9 in the press and in the intelligence initially of Soviet

10 military personnel, of Soviet surface-to-air missiles. And

11 the crucial question was, what for and what is coming. And

12 the Director of Central Intelligence -- who was proved in

13 the end to be right - was almost alone in his belief that

14 this was going to lead to a nuclear capability in Cuba that

15 could hit the U.S. And he raised these questions in the

16 month of August in a number of different ways. And the

17 National Security meeting from which this memorandum emerged

18 reviewed those problems, and as the memorandum itself shows,

19 the heavy emphasis of the President's concern and of the

20 Group's concern on the likelihood that developed and what

21 should be done about it, or in preparation for it, in August.

22 Mr. Schwarz. The memorandum has quite a range of matters

23 to be considered. And they range from, if I can use the

24 characterization, on the soft side, Item 1, which was consider-

25 ation of the U.S. pulling its missiles near the Soviet Union out

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

# TOP SECRET

of Turkey, two, on the hard side, Items 7 and 8 , which
are military possibilities of invasion or some other military
possibilities in connection with Cuba. Now, is that a
typical exercise that that White House, the President and
yourself would go through to look at a number of options...
ranging from the soft to the very tough?

Mr. Bundy. Yes.

Let me say in passing that there was nothing soft about
the problem of getting the Jupiter missiles out of Cuba.

Mr. Schwarz. Conciliatory, would that be the word?

Mr. Bundy. It problem of actually getting them out
which we came to in the following year was one which
demanded great diplomatic energy and finesse on the part of
the State and Defense Departments. But you are right. A
wide range of issues charactically would be discussed. And
the President had a habit of trying to look at problems from
many angles.

Mr. Schwarz. Were you fully in touch with the President
in connection with what became the missile crisis.

Mr. Bundy. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Was there any discussion of assassinating
Fidel Castro during that period?

Mr. Bundy. None.

Mr. Schwarz. Was there agreement reached that as part
of the solution to the missile crisis that related to U.S.

1 action vis-a-vis Cuba. There was a so-called no invasion
2 pledge. There was an undertaking on our side that if the
3 offensive capabilities -- and there was an argument on what
4 those were -- were removed, we on our side would undertake --
5 I don't want to present this language as if it is deeply
6 mathmatically precise -- but there was an undertaking on our
7 side that there would not be an assassination of Cuba.

8 The Chairman. Was that ever published?
9 Mr. Bundy. Yes. If my language is inconsistent with
10 what was published, then what was published should take
11 precedence, because I am only trying to report that.

12 Mr. Schwarz. Did this agreement exclude the sabotage
13 of Cuban facilities?
14 Mr. Bundy. Not in my view or in anyones' view in the
15 U.S. Government. Just to give you an example of things it
16 did not exclude, it did not exclude continued surveillance,
17 which is not perfectly normal in relations between friendly
18 states, that you overfly and check out what they are doing.
19 But surveillance was an explicit and public part of the
20 necessary concern for U.S. satisfaction with the resolution
21 of the Cuban missile crisis.

22 Mr. Schwarz. Recognizing again that this is calling for
23 an opinion, during the course of the missile crisis did
24 anything happen with respect to the attitudes and actions of
25 either the President or the Attorney General that in your

1 Mr. Bundy. Well, yes. There are a great many things that
2 enter into my judgment about whether the President or the
3 Attorney General would ever have done that, and I would like
4 to say, Mr. Chairman, that the most important point I want to
5 make, just from where I stand personally is that I find the
6 notion that they separately, privately encouraged, ordered,
7 arranged efforts at assassination totally inconsistent with
8 what I knew of both of them. And as an example, I would cite --
9 and only one among very many -- the role played by the Attorney
10 General in the Missile Crisis, because it was he who, most
11 emphatically, argued against a so-called surgical air strike
12 or any other action that would bring death upon many, in favor
13 of the more careful approach which was eventually adopted by
14 the President in the form of a quarrantine or a blockade.
15 The Chairman. Well, Mr. Bundy, let me put what may be
16 the same question a little different way.
17 You came to know both the President and the Attorney
18 General rather intimately in the period of your long associa-
19 tion with them, did you not?
20 Mr. Bundy. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
21 The Chairman. Based upon that acquaintanceship, do you
22 believe, under any of the circumstances that occurred during
23 that whole period, either one of them would have authorized
24 the assassination of Fidel Castro?
25 Mr. Bundy. I most emphatically do not.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 102

TOP SECRET

99

1 Let me make a more general point that comes at it from another way.

If you have heard testimony that there was pressure to do something about Cuba, there was. There was an effort, both from the President in his style and from the Attorney General in his style to keep the government active in looking for ways to weaken the Cuban regime. There was. But if you, as I understand it, and not even those who pressed the matter most closely as having essentially been inspired by the White House can tell you that anyone ever said to them, go and kill anyone.

Let me say one other thing about these two men, and that is that there was something that they really wanted done, they did not leave people in doubt, so that on the one hand, I would say about their character, their purposes and their nature and the way they confronted international affairs that I find it incredible that they would have ordered or authorized explicitly or implicitly an assassination of Castro. I also feel that if, contrary to everything that I know about their character, they had had such a decision and such a purpose, people would not have been in any doubt about it.

The Chairman. Then have you any way to explain to the Committee, or any explanation to give to the Committee, as to why Mr. Helms would testify that he was under, or that he had no doubts, that the Agency was fully authorized to proceed to not only develop schemes, but to engage in active attempts to

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 103

# TOP SECRET

1 assassinate Castro?

2 Mr. Bundy. I have no explanation of that. 100

3 Senator Mondale. Part of our attempt to solve this riddle

4 of what would appear to be a record at the highest level, which

5 is at least not directly an order of an assassination plot or

6 attempt, and square it with the fact that attempts were made, is

7 to seek to understand the personalities and motivations and

8 methods of operation of people further down the chain of

9 command.

10 We have heard quite a few evaluations of Mr. Harvey as

11 a free-wheeling, James Bond kind of operator, and it has been

12 suggested through some disquiet and apprehension at higher

13 levels about the nature of his conduct. And I would -- I don't

14 know. I am beginning to have doubts about Mr. Helms whom I

15 have always admired. There is, for example, a memorandum that

16 is in the record to Mr. Rusk in response to a memo which the

17 Secretary wrote Mr. Helms following an article appearing in

18 some Cuban newspaper charging that the Mafia had been hired and

19 used by the CIA to assassinate Castro, in which Helms specifi-

20 cally and categorically denies flat out that any such relation-

21 ship existed when in fact it did and when in fact Mr. Helms was

22 part of it.

23 Now, how do we sort this out? Is Mr. Helms someone who

24 might have, on his own, gone beyond the authority conferred

25 upon him by persons higher up?

# TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

TOP SECRET

101

1 Mr. Bundy. Well, if you had asked me that question a

2 year ago, Senator, I would have said in my experience with him

3 he was not such an officer, but I have no way of dealing with

4 the kind of thing you have just described.

5 Senator Mondale. It shatters me because I have always

6 respected him. Because we know that these assassination attempts

7 occurred. We know that Mr. Helms was a part of it. We have

8 testimony that Mr. Helms and Mr. Harvey met and agreed not to

9 tell Mr. McCone what they were doing. And then we have a

10 document here -- well, that was Cubella -- and then we have a

11 memo from Helms to Rusk which, in Minnesota language looks

12 like a lie. Now, I just don't know. Maybe there are other

13 explanations.

14 The Chairman. The memo to Rusk had to do with Cubella

15 rather than the Mafia.

16 Senator Mondale. Is that it? It was not the Mafia?

17 Mr. Schwarz. It was Cubella, except if you just substitute

18 Cubella for the word Mafia.

19 The Chairman. What you said otherwise is correct.

20 Senator Mondale. But he was involved personally with

21 Cubella, wasn't he? And he knew that, and this memo said no.

22 Is there a plausible explanation?

23 Mr. Madigan. Helms has one.

24 Senator Baker. Helms' position is that he did not lie,

25 that he did not have anything to do with the Cubella incident,

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

TOP SECRET

1 is that right?

2 Mr. Madigan. I think Helms claimed that Cubella is in

3 the strict context of the memos, operating on his own.

4 The Chairman. Well, I believe rather than speculate, we

5 had better look back carefully, and that ought to be another

6 subject for Mr. Helms when he returns.

7 Senator Mondale. Well, then I will stand corrected.

8 Senator Hart of Michigan. Would you yield?

9 I want to make the same record note that I suspend the

10 comment I made about that document yesterday. I thought it was

11 a flat-out lie.

12 Senator Mondale. I did too. I withdraw that, and I think

13 it would be good if the staff would write us a little memo.

14 Senator Baker. Fritz might like to know that yesterday I

15 asked Counsel if they, as a combined staff operation, would

16 prepare for us, and I believe they agreed to do this, prepare

17 for us two briefs, one citing the testimony and the exhibit

18 evidence, that would support an inference that the authority

19 was Presidential; and another brief, citing the record and the

20 exhibit evidence citing the inference that it was not. There is an abundance of both, to be frank with you. So that we

22 can lay them down side by side and make our own separate

23 judgment.

24 Do I understand the staff is going to do it?

25 The Chairman. That is right.

6  anteroom, that will give us a chance to take care of this

1 The Chairman. We seem to have a developing problem for
2 reasons unexplained with the Justice Department. I have
3 already mentioned one aspect of that problem, in connection with
4 the failure of the Department to supply most of the material
5 that we have requested, though that request was put to the
6 Department two months ago, and it has been decided already by
7 the Committee that Mr. Levy and Mr. Kelley should be brought
8 before the Committee in the hopes that these delays can be
9 overcome.

10 The first question before the Committee is when that can
11 be done. It is suggested that the Attorney General has Tuesday
12 morning available. If it is all right with the Committee, I
13 would like to schedule his appearance, together with that of
14 Mr. Kelley, for Tuesday morning.

15 Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, I don't mean to intrude my
16 personal convenience into this consideration unduly, but if
17 the Attorney General could do it at Tuesday noon, say, it would
18 help me. I have a commitment in Tennessee Monday night. If
19 I catch the Tuesday morning plane I can't get here until 11:50.
20 If that's not possible, I will cancel Monday.

21 The Chairman. This is procedural in character, so it is
22 not altogether important that every member be present. I think
23 that from the standpoint of this Committee schedule, Tuesday
24 morning, the Attorney General and Mr. Kelley would be good,
25 would it not?

2 Senator Baker. Well, why don't you leave it Tuesday

4 The Chairman. We are only informed that he has Tuesday

6 Mr. Gitenstein.. I spoke to Doug Marvin, one of his

7 Executive Assistants, and he said Tuesday was a possibility,

8 Wednesday is a problem because he has a Cabinet meeting and

9 he wasn't sure about Tuesday and he was going to get back to

10 us in the next hour or two.

11 The Chairman. Well, let's see if we can't set it up

12 Tuesday.

13 Senator Baker. If you can set it up Tuesday afternoon and

14 nobody objects, that would be better for me.

15 The Chairman. Well, if we can, we'll set it up Tuesday

16 afternoon.

17 Senator Mathias. What is that for?

18 The Chairman. That is for Levy and Kelley to appear for

19 the purpose of telling us why they can't, or why it has taken

20 two months and we still are waiting for the documents, most

21 of the documents we requested.

22 Senator Mathias. Well, I won't be here, but that's no

23 reason.

24 Senator Baker. Are you going to be here Tuesday

25 morning?

1 Senator Mathias. Don't worry about it.

2 The Chairman. All right.

3 The second thing I would like to bring up in this connec-

4 tion is that I was informed yesterday by the staff that the

5 FBI has undoubtedly received instructions that none of its

6 agents are to be interrogated or interviewed by the staff of

7 this Committee. I would like someone who knows the details and

8 can be very specific to tell the Committee the exact status of

10 that information as being authoritative.

11 Mr. Elliff. Yesterday morning at 9:00 o'clock or shortly

12 thereafter, I received a phone call from the FBI's liaison with

13 this Committee with respect to a series of interviews that had

14 been arranged with the Bureau some relating to the Huston Plan,

15 some relating to Martin Luther King matters. I was informed that

16 I had to address this request to the Justice Department in order
to secure approval for these staff interviews.

18 I then called our liaison in the Justice Department,

19 Special Counsel William O'Conner, and he told me I might as

20 well submit these requests in writing, because the Justice

21 Department would take at least ten days to give us an answer

22 on these requests and he didn't know what the answer was going

23 to be.

24 I then explored with him what some of the reasons might be

25 for this delay and what the problems seemed to be, and the '

1 explanation that he gave me verbally was that the fact that
2 the Committee had notified the Department in its letter of
3 June 27th that certain cases that we were investigating were
4 abuse cases meant that any interviews that would be conducted
5 in connection with those matters would be considered by the
6 Department to be demand interviews, and therefore this brought
7 into play the provisions of the Federal Regulations which
8 require the Attorney General's approval.

9 Then the question as to whether the Attorney General would
10 approve or not involved two issues. First was that since we
11 had indicated the likelihood of an abuse in a particular area
12 that the Department itself would have to consider whether it
13 should institute a criminal investigation of that matter, and
14 then, if so, whether our interview would interfere with that
15 ongoing criminal investigation.

16 And second, that the Department considered that any inter-
17 views undertaken by the Committee in such cases might inadver-
18 tently immunize the subject of the interview, and he referred
19 generally to some cases and we have attempted to do legal
20 research on those cases and find this to be a very shaky position:
21 but they have good lawyers over there and if they want to come
22 up with a sophisticated argument, we expect that they could be
23 able to do that.

23 The Chairman. Lawyers can make an argument over anything.

24 Mr. Elliff. That's so. And so the final conclusion is

1 that he did anticipate that subpoenas would be required

2 in every instance and this position is very difficult for us to

.3 accept because interviews, the low-key interview in the non-

4 pressure situation is an opportunity to elicit information that

5 is not matched by the formal subpoena situation, and to be

6 able to proceed initially by interview and then confirm, under

7 oath, via subpoena, is just absolutely essential for an effective

8 investitation. So this is where we stand on this issue.

9 We later received a letter pertaining to an earlier

10 request for interviews relating to FBI COINTELPRO disruptive

11 activities where we had asked for certain interviews, and this

12 letter did not go into specifics, but merely stated that there

13 were problems that would have to be resolved, that the charac-

14 terization of an area of the Committee inquiry as abuse might

15 significantly alter arrangements of access to witnesses who

16 are present employees of the Department.

17 The Chairman. In other words, the thrust of all of this

18 is that the more serious the nature of the inquiry, the more

19 difficult it will be to obtain the information, that if we are

20 concerned about a possible illegality or abuse, then the

21 Department will make it as difficult as possible for us to

22 secure the information.

23 Mr. Elliff.. I might add that it seems to be in the nature

24 of the documents also, the more serious the allegation, the more

25 resistance there is to providing us --

2 have not given us the documents on the controversial matters.

3 They've given us plenty of documentation on less controversial

4 matters.

5 The Chairman. I think it is ironic that the resistance we

6 get from the Justice Department is so much more substantial than

7 the resistance we have gotten from the CIA.

8 Senator Baker. That's not necessarily so. I agree with

9 you the resistance is unfortunate and inappropriate, but I

10 can think of a request for documentation from the CIA that is

11 now more than a month old and they haven't had the good grace

12 to tell us no. They have told us nothing.

13 The Chairman. But on the whole we've gotten a greater

14 measure of cooperation from the CIA.

15 Senator Schweiker. I wonder, does either counsel know,

16 Mr. Chairman, whether the Attorney General or the FBI Director

17 initially confirmed whether they made any commitments to

18 Congress about supplying documents or materials to the

19 Committee?

20 Mr. Miller. Senator Mathias can tell you, and Senator

21 Hart.

22 Senator Schweiker. Might there be a statement in their

23 testimony in confirmation, in agreeing to furnish Congress with

24 materials of this nature?

1 me say, since my opinion has been asked, that I had a most
2 discouraging talk with the Attorney General a couple of weeks
3 ago. I went down to talk to him about privacy legislation and
4 the Department of Justice at the moment is taking about as hard
5 a line as any kind that I know of in the last fifteen years.
6 Its whole kind of attitude --
7 Senator Tower. I just wonder if we shouldn't take this up
8 with them.

9 The Chairman. I think we should, but I think we should
10 also, in advance of that, in view of the kinds of signals we
11 are now getting from the Justice Department, indicate that we
12 believe that these objections that they are raising, or questions
13 that they are raising, are a serious impediment procedurally
14 to our Committee and that we have every intention of interviewing
15 such agents as may be necessary, and that if necessary, we will
16 subpoena them.

17 Mr. Elliff. Our feeling is it is preferable not to
18 proceed by subpoena, but we do have a subpoena for one FBI
19 agent which we brought with us today which we would like to
20 proceed with.

21 The Chairman. Can you give us the facts of that case?

22 Mr. Epstein. This is an agent who is presently in Atlanta,
23 Georgia, and the information we've received from other witnesses
24 was that in 1964, I believe, he visited a newspaper editor in
25 Atlanta, closed the door, put his hat on the desk, and said he

1 noted from reading The Constitution that we were picturing

2 Dr. King as a moral leader and something of a hero and then this

3 agent went on to talk in great detail about Dr. King's personal

4 life which he claimed he had learned from a confidential source,

5 and our interest in interviewing this agent obviously relates

6 to the circumstances surrounding that visit to a newspaperman,

7 who directed him to do that, what the purpose of that visit

8 was, whether there was any documentation --

9 Senator Baker. Who was the newspaper man?

10 Mr. Epstein. His name was Eugene Patterson and he was

11 with the Atlanta Constitution at that time. He's now with a

12 newspaper in Florida.

13 The Chairman. Do you believe the subpoena now to be

14 necessary because of what you have been told by the Justice

15 Department?

16 Mr. Elliff. We have other agents which we would like to

17 proceed with at the interview level, so we would like to proceed

18 at both levels to get their reaction to both types of requests.

19 What is their reaction to a subpoena going to be, what is

20 their reaction to a renewed request to interview going to be?

21 So we crystallize each issue.

22 Senator Tower. I still think it might be good for us to

23 hold that up until we talk about it, since they are coming in

24 Tuesday morning or Tuesday sometime, it's not going to push

25 things too far.

4 outrage and that it won't do, and we will see you Tuesday?

5 Don't wait till Tuesday.

6 The Chairman. I think something should be said, actually.

7 Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, it prejudges the hell out

8 of it, but unless we get an extension to 1980 for this Committee

9 The Chairman. I think you're right. Something needs to be

10 said publicly that the Committee is determined that we feel

11 that not only has time -- we've already said, we've already

12 made public the letter we have sent. I think a follow-up needs

13 to be that we are concerned that impediments that are now being

14 suggested which would interfere with the Committee's right to

15 interrogate witnesses, we do not intend to allow the Committee's

16 work to be obstructed and if necessary we will be prepared to

17 subpoena witnesses though we would hope that that would not

18 have to be the case.

25 Senator Mondale. Just one point.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 116

TOP SECRET

113

There is this troublesome dictum in U.S. vs. Nixon about what might be nondiscoverable, all of which seems to bear on sort of foreign policy matters.

Am I correct -- I think we're going to hear a lot about that -- but am I correct in reading that decision that it really almost standsl wholly that they have the duty to produce all of the documentation and that case holds for that proposition, so that in our CIA matters, while they might raise some of this dictum, the FBI has no such defense, unless we're really trodding on those same grounds.

Mr. Epstein. Of course, there is another issue in the Bureau materials, because we're on the issue of investigative files, which has never been really litigated, and that is the propriety of Executive Privilege when it comes to that.

I might add that the importance of the issue of going to subpoena on these really raises that, because if we go to subpoena on documents, then that is going to be worthless unless we know in advance that we are going to win in court in a short period of time, including whether we have jurisdiction to be there.

Senator Mondale. In other words, you are saying they are going to raise the Executive Privilege defense, but that was the Nixon defense.

Mr. Epstein. I think that they would love for us to be in the position of having to issue a subpoena for documents,

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

17 because then it would be a year.

1 Mr. Schwarz. The problem is the Ervin Committee was found

2 not to have jurisdiction to issue the subpoena.

3 The Chairman. Well, we know we're going to do the next

4 step on that.

5 Now, may I raise one other point --

6 Senator Baker. That's not quite true. The Ervin Committee

7 wasn't found to have no jurisdiction or standing to seek the

8 documents or to issue subpoenas, but they failed to carry the

9 burden of proving that it was required under the mandate of

10 their inquiry.

11 Now, I have another matter, Frank.

12 The Chairman. We have two or three matters. Can I

13 recognize Senator Mondale first, because he had asked it.

14 Senator Mondale. A few days ago, when the White House

15 people were here, they showed us a document which we have in

16 our files which disclosed that President Nixon in 1970 had

17 ordered the delivery of three machine guns to some people in

18 Chile and had done so with instructions that that order should

19 go directly to some subordinate officials in CIA and should be

20 done without advising the official channels. And it is thought

21 that they were directed against a General Schneider, who was

22 a top official in the Chilean government opposed to a coup.

23 He was a Constitutionalist.

24 Schneider was killed, and there was a machine gun in the

1 possession of those who did so.

2 Now what I would like is, while we finish this cycle on
3 assassinations, that we include among our studies of alleged
4 assassinations this matter and we request the documentation, of
5 all appropriate documents, under the category of assassination.

6 Mr. Schwarz. Senator, when that document came to our
7 attention, we questioned a person who expands upon the allega-
8 tions contained in the documents. I wrote a letter to the
9 White House and the CIA. We wanted forthwith to receive
10 copies of all such documents relating to the passage of weapons.

11 We have had no response from the CIA.

12 Mr. Hills, we met with in the White House a week ago
13 Tuesday or Wednesday, and I said we must have the documents and
14 'he said you cannot have them until you have the briefing on
15 Chile, because we refuse to accept this as an assassination
16 plan.

17 The Chairman. May I make this suggestion, Senator

18 Mondale?

19 First of all, I believe that it is absolutely imperative
20 that the Committee complete its investigation on the issue of
21 the assassination of foreign government leaders before the
22 recess and issue its report. That puts us under great pressure,
23 but if we don't do it, I am going to ask the Committee to stay
24 on the job. I would like very much to go to China, that is my
25 first opportunity in forty years to go to China, and I have

1 such a trip laid on, but I am going to set it aside and ask
2 the Committee to continue its work right into the recess until
3 this is done. Otherwise, we are in a hopeless situation.
4 Senator Schweiker. I think, Mr. Chairman, if we don't
5 finish it by then, we never will.
6 The Chairman. We never willl
7 I think we should look into this assassination, it is an
8 assassination. I think it's part of our responsibility to
9 look into it. But it is not an assassination, whatever the
10 CIA input may have been, it is not an assassination of a head
11 of state, and so therefore I don't want it to further delay
12 the completion of this phase of our inquiry.
13 Now with that in mind, I am in full accord with what
14 Senator Mondale says.
15 Senator Schweiker. Could we put it to another phase and
16 not in this phase?
17 The Chairman. Yes, we are going to have a phase on Chile,
18 anyway. It would fit into the Chilean case.
19 Senator Mondale. It is significant because if we accept
20 their interpretation that it is not assassination, then we
21 avoid an understanding that we had that these documents, all
22 supposed to be available , then we get into a discovery problem.
23 In other words, I know what we're getting at, and I would
24 guess that we should proceed as rapidly as possible, but we
25 shouldn't hold up the cycle of --

1 Senator Schweiker. Well Fritz, there is another question

2 along the same lines, and that is why I don't want to see it

3 cloud this issue, and that is the Glomar Explorer, stopped by

4 the NLRB proceeding was shown to have stopped in Chile just

5 about a week or so before Allende was killed, just by coincidence

6 for mechanical repairs. I would like to find out that one,

7 too.

8 But this is a whole new thing. This puts us into the

9 Chile thing. Because I'm just as interested as you are. I

10 don't see that it hurts anything to put it in a Phase II

11 proposition with Chile.

12 The Chairman. And Fritz, we can say that the Committee

13 regards it in the category of assassination, but we can differ-

14 entiate it from the initial report, which does deal with

15 foreign leaders.

16 Senator Hart of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, before you go to

17 a new subject -- and I am uneasy raising this -- but your

18 reply reminds me, you say that we are going to conclude assassina-

19 tions and issue our report before we go on recess. I think that

20 disposes too readily of the problem that is going to confront

21 us in a very few weeks, and that is having heard all of this,

22 now what do we do? I don't think we have decided yet how we

23 are going to present, once we open the doors, we've got to know

24 how we are going to handle it. I don't think we ought to lock

25 ourselves in at the moment to a written report, as we leave town.

1 the first of August.

2 Senator Baker. I agree with you 100 percent.

3 The Chairman. This Committee has got to get its business done and I know the purpose of the delay downtown is to make it as difficult as possible for us to cope with our work. We will be engulfed completely if we cannot deal with this phase of our work in the time that we have given it and put it over until the fall. What I'm suggesting is not just simply the report of the Committee. We are going to complete our witnesses, we have time to issue such a report.

11 I am also suggesting the recommendations the Committee will make with respect to this issue. We have to put this behind us. It is just folly not to do it, because we must get on with the other phases of the report and there is no reason we cannot do it. If we can't do it by the end of this month, then we're not going to be any more advantaged or any better advantaged to then go out on our recess and come back and take it up anew in the fall. It is a very clear-cut issue.

19 Senator Hart of Michigan. But what is not clear-cut to me is how we report to our peers.

21 The Chairman. We will take that up.

22 Senator Schweiker. We discussed that at one meeting. We had a little informal meeting. Maybe you missed that, Phil.

3 why we can't address ourselves to this question.

4 Senator Hart of Michigan. The only reason that I raise

5 that is that I am as anxious to conclude this chapter, but this

6 Committee, as a Committee, then must decide the ultimate

7 question: do you have open hearings? Do you go to a closed Senate?

8

9 The Chairman. That will be a top item of consideration for the Committee.

10 I have only deferred this discussion thinking

11 that we had best get all of the evidence first. That is all.

12 Then we will take it up at an appropriate time and discuss it.

13 Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, do I understand the situation

14 to be then it is your hope that we will finish our Executive

15 Session testimony before the August recess, but not a report

16 to the Senate?

17 The Chairman. No, that is not my position. My position is

18 that we should complete the testimony and make our report and

19 recommendation on this issue.

20 Senator Baker. But without prejudice to a future determina-

21 tion of whether we have public hearings?

22 The Chairman. Oh, yes, that's always open to us. But I --

23 let me make it -- let's not have any misunderstanding there.

24 It is always open to this Committee to decide whether

25 public hearings on this or any other issue should be arranged in

1 23 the fall. Obviously, we cannot have them until fall.
2 My personal position is against public hearings on the
3 issue of assassination. But what I am proposing is that the
4 Committee make its report, and I think that is a question the
5 Committee will have to take up and decide, and I think the
6 appropriate way to disclose these facts, and I personally believe
7 they must be disclosed, is through a report of the Committee
8 that is made public, and I think that report should be made
9 before the recess.

10 Senator Baker. I don't think we can do that.
11 Senator Tower. Mr. Chairman, physically we have got three
12 weeks. Whether we can hear all of these witnesses and sit down
13 and prepare the report and have the Committee agree on the
14 report, report it to the Senate and have the Senate act on it
15 in three weeks is questionable in my mind. I, like you, want
16 to do it, but I wonder if we can do a workmanlike job and do
17 it in that time.

18 The Chairman. Well, let me say this, that the very request
19 that Senator Baker has made, and I hope we don't get into a too
20 prolonged liscussion on this issue because we cannot decide
21 it right now, but the very report that Senator Baker has asked
22 for is now in the process of preparation. That report gives,
23 by necessity, as much of the meat, the briefs that Senator
24 Baker has asked for, as much of the report, laying out the
25 factual, the evidence that the Committee has seen. And I think

2 it, but I know that our position will be much worse in every

3 way if we fail to do it.

4 Now without trying to decide that now, let us proceed.

5 Senator Schweiker. May I make one comment on that, Mr.

6 Chairman?

7 I have had vacillating feelings on public hearings, and I

8 think what I have come down on is this. I think we should go

9 ahead and issue a preliminary report without public hearings.

10 I think we should put the matter of public hearings in abeyance

11 until we get into the Chile thing and some of the other areas

12 of so-called assassinations that may not be Presidential

13 assassinations per se and leave the Committee option that we

14 may well want to elect to go into what happened in Chile

15 publicly and bring up that assassination if that is what we

16 determined.

17 I have trouble determining at this point in time whether

18 we should have public hearings, and I think we ought to keep

19 that option open as we go along.

20 The Chairman. I have no argument with the Senator on that

21 score.

22 Senator Schweiker. I know. As I say, it reconciles with

23 your views and it protects the rights of those who say they

24 want public hearings.

1 Senator Baker has another matter.

2 Senator Baker. It won't take but a brief moment.

3 I think I owe the Committee a report on the statement that I made to the Press a few moments ago. I did not intend

4 to make a statement, but that it becomes impossible to avoid

5 when you step outside in these circumstances.

6 The Chairman. It is a good thing for you that Senator

7 Morgan is not present.

8 Senator Baker. As some of you may know, the news last

9 night and again this morning carried a story to the effect that

10 a Colonel, a retired Colonel in the Air Force by the name of

11 Fletcher Prowdy, has alleged by Alexander Butterfield was an

12 associate or an employee or a plant of something of the sort of

13 the CIA when he was at the White House.

14 I was asked if I had any comment on that. I was asked if

15 I was surprised by that, and my reply was I had heard that

16 story before. I had never commented on it because I had no

17 proof of it. And it's really so. As you know, in this town

18 if you don't have confirmation of it you get into deep

19 trouble.

20 Second, that I think it is worthy of looking into, and I

21 said I thought the Prowdy statement added a new dimension to

22 the rumors and I thought that it did warrant further investiga-

23 tion, that I would recommend that to this Committee at the

24 appropriate time.

The Chairman. That is fine, and I have also said that I would ask the Committee for an investigation of this charge, and Bill Miller tells me we have already received from the Agency a preliminary report that is not satisfactory. We are pursuing it and getting further information.

Senator Schweiker?

Senator Schweiker. I have a brief matter I would like to seek the Committee's advice on.

Could we go off the record a minute?

The Chairman. Yes.

(Discussion off the record.)

Senator Hart of Colorado. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I have an item of business also.

When I was in Europe last week and pursuant to the direction of the Chairman and staff I tried to contact our friend QJWIN to try to wrap up that lihnk of the chain with, I must say, the complete cooperation of the CIA and Mr. Colby, who in fact sent a person over there to help uncover this individual. We know who he is and where he is.

The CIA American contact talked to him, largely for the reason that he feels extreme loyalty still to the Agency and to one or two particular people that he worked with and through. He opted not to meet with me or anybody else. The feeling is, both on my part and Mr. Colby's, that if we got his contact in that chain to get in touch with him directly that he would talk

1 to us, and I leave it to the Committee whether this is
2 important enough for us to pursue and it would probably involve
3 a couple of people going back over.

4 Senator Baker. What is your recommendation?
5 Senator Hart of Colorado. My own feeling, based almost
6 purely on the principle that no stone should be left unturned
7 is that we should do it.

8 There are some unanswered questions. He was here in the
9 states in '63, he was not confined to one operation and we
10 don't know what he was doing.

11 Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, I would recommend that we
12 commission Senator Hart to do that for us.
13 Senator Hart of Colorado. It would take the cooperation
14 of one of the witnesses we've had here before to do it.

15 The Chairman. What is your recommendation, Senator
16 Hart, I'm sorry?
17 Senator Hart of Colorado. That we should do it, that we
18 should get the cooperation of Mr. O'Donnell.

19 The Chairman. That we should do what?
20 Senator Baker. Interview QJWIN in Europe.
21 Senator Mathias. Which means somebody has to do it and
22 take O'Donnell with him.

3 Senator Hart of Colorado. What his orders were, what his
4 scope of authority was, what he was doing over and above -- well,
5 what he was doing in the Congo, what he was doing over and
6 above his Congo operations, why he was in Florida in 1963.

7 The Chairman. Well, Gary, when you told me this, you
8 told me that this man had said to the CIA go between who was
9 trying to arrange this interview that first of all he preferred
10 not to be questioned, and secondly, if he were questioned, he
11 would lie.

12 Senator Hart of Colorado. That was on the basis of the
13 appointment we were trying to arrange then, and that was purely
14 because of his loyalties to the Agency. The case was not
15 presented well to him. What I am saying is if we took back his
16 contact for whom he feels loyalty and the fellow should talk,
17 I think the feeling of the person who had made the original
18 contact is that he would talk.

19 It was not presented to him in the way that the Agency
20 wanted him to do it.

21 The Chairman. How valuable do you think this information
22 is to the Committee? I'll tell you my concern. My concern is
23 the one thing I have feared more than anything else, in this
24 investigation is that we take some action that allows them to
25 say that we have blown the cover of some valuable agent abroad,

1 and this is what they feared all along, and the whole intelli-
2 gence apparatus would be gravely weakened and the man in the
3 field would be jeopardized by investigation of this kind.
4 We take that chance with this kind of and what do we
5 learn from it? Is it worth that chance?
6 Senator Hart of Colorado. Well, that question could be
7 asked of any witness that we have in here. Number two, the CIA,
8 Mr. Colby and the Chief of Station in Amsterdam, have no doubts
9 that this can be carried out without any security breach what-
10 soever. Now that's the CIA. He has not worked for them in
11 ten years.
12 The Chairman. And the CIA would be the first to jump
13 upon the breach and say, we told you so.
14 Senator Hart of Colorado. Well, I leave it to the
1.  5 Committee. I can't tell you what we're going to find out, it
    16 may be zero.
    17 Senator Mathias. The Station Chief does not raise that as
    18 one of the dangers.
    19 Senator Baker. Yes, they did.
    20 Senator Hart of Colorado. Nor does Colby.
    21 Mr. Wides. Mr. Chairman, excuse me. The paper that
    22 suggests the possibility that Mr. Win might have been in the
    23 United States in 1963 is a paper involving the activity records
    24 of William Harvey who will be here this afternoon and that may
    25 be that you can get more testimony under oath from him that will

1 shed some light as to whether he was just using QJWIN as a cover
2 which is what he told me, the designation for billing, or
3 whether he's willing to give out some more testimony.

4 The Chairman. Well, let us get that additional informa-
5 tion --

6 Senator Baker. One further point, Mr. Chairman, that might
7 be of interest if my memory is correct, and I believe it is
8 correct, is that the major commercial cover for the Agency in
9 Amsterdam was run by the Mullin Company
10 Senator Hart of Colorado. Frank, he's not worked for the
11 Agency in ten years. He's not an active agent.

12 The Chairman. Suppose that he were to tell us something
13 that is of importance, then how do we cross-examine him? Then
14 we have to bring him here for cross-examination, then we have
15 blown his cover.

16 Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, may I say one other thing?
17 I meant to say it, and I frankly forgot, just so my colleagues
18 know what I'm about and not that I'm doing it behind their
19 back.

20 I got a call last night from one of the editors of Harper's
21 magazine in Europe relaying to me that Bernard Barker wanted to
22 talk to me, and he thinks about the Butterfield situation, and
23 I intended to call him, but I wanted you to know that.

24 The Chairman. That's fine.

2 hearing room.)

3 The Chairman. All right.

4 You understand that the oath still applies to this part
5 of the testimony?

6 Mr. Schwarz will renew the questioning.

7 Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bundy, I want to call your attention now
8 to 1963, the Missile Crisis is over. Was there another reassess-
9 ment of Cuban policy in the winter and spring of '63?

10 Mr. Bundy. Yes, there was.

11 Mr. Schwarz. Again, did that reassessment of Cuban policy
12 involve a lot of reassessment of a lot of options?

13 Mr. Bundy. That is my refreshed recollection.

14 Mr. Schwarz. All right.

15 We've shown you a lot of documents, mostly by you in that
16 period, but some to you as well, and was one of the options the
17 consideration of the possibility that Mr. Castro might defect
18 or might be communicated to in a way that would bring him around
19 more closely to the United States?

20 Mr. Bundy. The question of opening communications with
21 Fidel Castro arises in 1963, I think at more than one time,
22 and without having my attention drawn to specific documents, I
23 wouldn't be able to spell that out very much.

24 Mr. Schwarz. But you agree that it is in there, and it
25 is in there?

1 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

2 Mr. Schwarz. Now did you also consider, in the spring of

3 1963, as you had in the fall of 1961, what would happen if

4 Castro died or were killed?

5 Mr. Bundy. What we did, we certainly posed the question,

6 the precise form is not clear to me, but what I now know from the

7 documents you have shown me, is we posed to the Director of the

8 Office of National Estimates, a Dr. Sherman Kent --

9 Mr. Schwarz. And what did Dr. Sherman Kent say in response

10 to that inquiry?

11 Mr. Bundy. Well, I would have to look at his response.

12 Mr. Schwarz. All right.

13 I would like to then mark a string of documents so you

14 can have that in front of you.

15 All right, would you mark as item 6, Bundy item 6, the

1  Mr. Schwarz. Now, have you had a chance to read them
2  again, Mr. Bundy?
3  Mr. Bundy. Yes.
4  Mr. Schwarz. In summary, Mr. Bundy, is it a fair characterization of these papers that you were, iand the Standing..
5
6  Group was, examining the question of what the situation would
7  be if Castro were to die?
8  Mr. Bundy. That is one of the things we were examining, certainly.
9
10 Mr. Schwarz. That was a gamut of matters I tried to
11 pose at the beginning of this line of questioning?
12 Mr. Bundy. Yes.
13 Mr. Schwarz. That was one of the things you were consider-
14 ing?
15 Mr. Bundy. Right.
16 Mr. Schwarz. This was a period of time, as the fall of
17 1961 may also have been, when people asked about or talked
18 about assassinations as a means of causing Mr. Castro's death.
19 Mr. Bundy. I am not aware of much conversation on that
20 subject in the spring of '63, so I would have to take your
21 word on that.
22 Mr. Schwarz. I am asking you, I have no word on that.
23 Mr. Bundy. No, I don't think there was much discussion in
24 the spring of '63 on that subject.
25 Mr. Schwarz. Well, let's see if we can agree on some

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 144

44

TOP SECRET

1 things first.

2 Can we further agree that the ultimate conclusion was that

3 Castro's death would not be desirable for the United States?

4 Mr. Bundy. The recommendation, or the assessment, which

5 comes back from the Office of National Estimates, makes it

6 clear that the odds would be that, upon Castro's death, his

7 brother Raul or some other figure in the regime would, with

8 Soviet backing and help take over control.

9 Then it goes on to say that there might be divisions and

10 splits, but that it was unlikely that anti-Communist forces

11 would be able to take over without extensive U.S. help and

12 probably U.S. military intervention.

13 Mr. Schwarz. All right.

14 Now, I would like to avoid having to go through every

15 single document.

16 Mr. Bundy. So would I.

17 Mr. Schwarz. And see if I could get you to agree with

18 this statement. You do agree that you were looking at a

19 situation that would exist as if Castro were killed?

20 Mr. Bundy. That is one of the things we were looking at.

21 Mr. Schwarz. And in connection with that, was his being

22 killed by assassination one of the ways which you understood

23 he might be killed?

24 Mr. Bundy. I don't have any recollection of that point,

25 of it being on our minds.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 145

TOP SECRET

45

142

Mr. Schwarz. All right.

Then why were you looking at the question of his being

killed? Was there something known?

Mr. Bundy. I really don't have any independent of it.

My sense of events in 1963 is that the internal pressure from
within the Administration to "do something about Cuba" was
very much lower. There was, however, external pressure. There
was political pressure in the United States, critics of the
Administration were making speeches about how not enough was
being done and we must get rid of the Castro regime, and as I
think I may have said earlier, and I would like to say now,

I think that one reason for getting an estimate of this kind
was to get it on record from the point of view of those who
did not think we should be fussing with questions of assassina-
tion or anything like it, that it was not a sound policy,
leaving aside its moral meaning and wider political meaning
from the point of view of the narrow objectives we had in Cuba.

Mr. Schwarz. Who was taking the position that assassina-
tion could be --

Mr. Bundy. I have no recollection on that.

Mr. Schwarz. But someone was?

Mr. Bundy. I have no recollection on that.

Mr. Schwarz. You have no recollection of any position
being taken pro or con?

Mr. Bundy. I have no recollection of any specific

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

46
1 conversation or position that triggered this particular
2 inquiry.

3 The Chairman. Well, isn't it perfectly plausible that
4 this inquiry sought to examine what the situation would be in
5 the event of Castro's death by whatever means it might occur?
6 Does it necessarily follow that because the Administration
7 was making such a plausible inquiry against such a contingency
8 that might arise at any time that therefore it was within the
9 mind of the Administration to kill Castro? I don't see the
10 connection.

11 Mr. Bundy. Well, you make my point, Mr. Chairman. That's
12 just my point.

13 Mr. Schwarz. Now in connection with that, would you look
14 at your own Agenda for the April 19th meeting, 6-G?
15 Under item 1 -- you distinguish between item 1 and item
16 2. Item 1 is the possible use of contingencies for the
17 achievement of wider political objectives; and item 2 is programs
18 that might be initiated by the United States government.

19 I call your attention to the fact that the reference to
20 the possible death of Castro is one of the items under item
21 1 and not under item 2.

22 Mr. Bundy. That is correct.

23 Mr. Schwarz. And do you regard that as relevant to the
24 exchange you had with the Chairman just now?

25 Mr. Bundy. It seems to me it bears out the Chairman's

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

TOP SECRET

145

47. 
1 point, that you have a number of possible things that might
2 happen, that you would then have something to do something
3 about, or to act in the light of. The other are the things
4 that you might do without waiting for some contingency to
5 arise.

6 Mr. Schwarz. Now the only remaining question I have on
7 this group of documents is, how was it that the subject of the
8 death of Castro -- do you investigate the possibilities of the
9 death of foreign leaders as a regular matter?

10 Mr. Bundy. Well, the question ,"After: Stalin, What?" was
11 the staple of discussions in the 1940's, everywhere, academies
12 and I would assume inside the United States government; the
13 question after DeGaulle was a question about Western European
14 policy for a great many years. And one could pick smaller
15 figures, more and less controversial, and have the same kind of
16 question coming up, in a situation in which a particular
17 individual is as dominant a figure in a set of events which
18 it had the two, quite contrasting but heavy consequences of the
19 Bay of Pigs and the Missile Crisis, it doesn't seem to me to
20 be an irrational question to ask, without any relation as to
21 whether the United States itself would have any active advisory
22 role or any role whatever in having that event come to pass.

23 Mr. Schwarz. All right.

24 Would you mark as Exhibit 7 the September 20 document
25 which is the page -- which states the assassination of Castro

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Kelley, would you take over the ques-
tioning of Mr. Bundy, with the permission of the Chairman, on
that particular series of documents, which is at the heading,
September 20th '63 on the chronology.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Let me show Mr. Bundy the documents.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, first, will you tell us where the
documents are, because I couldn't find them under the heading
you gave us.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

In Bundy Book 2, there is at Tab A the memorandum dated
July 25th, 1963 from Mr. George Denney to Mr. Crimmins,
entitled "Cuba, Possible Courses of Action.

At Tab B of Bundy Book 2 is a memorandum dated September
20th, 1963, from Gordon Chase to Mr. Bundy, and this memorandum
summarizes the Denney memorandum of July 25th.

Mr. Bundy, did you review these documents with members of
the staff earlier this week?

Mr. Bundy. Yes, I did.

Mr. Kelley. Do you have any independent recollection of
these documents?

Mr. Bundy. Well, as I read a document of this kind, which
comes to me from a member of my own staff, I am very often
reminded and I am in this case, that this is a document which
I did review and that it reflects his arguments as I then heard

1 them.

2 Mr. Kelley. Who was Mr. Gordon Chase?

3 Mr. Bundy. Well, he was an assistant of mine at the time with special responsibilities for Cuban affairs, and perhaps

4 more widely in Latin America. He was at that time a foreign

5 service officer secunded to the White House.

6 Mr. Kelley. Did he have any responsibility for covert

7 actions?

8 Mr. Bundy. No.

9 Mr. Kelley. Did he provide staff assistance to you with

10 respect to the Special Group or the Special Group (Augmented)?

11 Mr. Bundy. Well, he may have done in some exceptional

12 case when I needed his opinion on a matter, but in ordinary

13 cases he would not have been party to Special Group work.

14 Mr. Kelley. What kind of things did he do with the

15 special responsibility for Cuba? What did that involve?

16 Mr. Bundy. He would be keeping in touch with the Cuban

17 Task Force, which by this time was in the Department of State,

18 the MONGOOSE operation having been disbanded. He would have

19 been responsible for keeping me alert to matters that were

20 proceeding in that Task Force that might have an implication for

21 the White House.

22 Mr. Kellay. Who was the head of the Cuban Task Force?

23 Mr. Bundy. Well I don't want to get this wrong, but I

24 think by this time it was Mr. Crimmins.

25 TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

51

1 Mr. Kelley. Mr. Crimmins was in the State Department and

2 he was a foreign service officer?

3 Mr. Bundy. That is right.

4 Mr. Kelley. The Cuban Task Force, what was that?

5 Mr. Bundy. Well, it was the successor to the MONGOOSE

6 group, but much less oriented toward secret operations than

7 MONGOOSE, and the review of secret operations then came back

8 under the complete control of the Special Group, by now, I

9 think, called the 303 Committee, which was a lineal successor

10 of 5412.

11 Mr. Kelley. I call your attention now to Mr. Denney's

12 mémorandum, which is at Tab A in Book 2, and it is true, is

13 it not that the memorandum is to Mr. Crimmins?

14 Mr. Bundy. Right.

15 Senator Tower. Do you have any independent recollection

16 of this memorandum?

17 Mr. Bundy. I have no knowledge that I ever saw it, and I

18 did not find it familiar when I looked at it the other day.

19 Mr. Kelley. It is true, is it not, that Mr. Chase's memo

20 to you summarizes this much longer memorandum by Mr. Denney?

21 Mr. Bundy. Is that what it is?

22 Mr. Schwarz. Does it do that, Mr. Kelley, because Chase

23 memorandum starts by saying, here is a summary of Paul Sakwa's

24 Mr. Kelley. I think that is an error in Mr. Chase's memo,

25 because it is clear that what is being summarized here is Mr.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

TOP SECRET

1 Denney's memorandum.

2 Mr. Bundy. Let me suggest that you focus on Mr. Chase's
memorandum with respect to my recollection and responsibility,
that is clearly the operative document.

5 Mr. Kelley. With respect to Mr. Chase's memorandum, in
his summary of the rationale of proposals, he states, as second,
"the present importance of Castro as a nationalist symbol makes
him the obvious operational target; assassination is excluded
to avoid Castro's martyrdom."

10 Do you have any recollection of why he would exclude
assassination? Does that imply to you, or do you recollect,
whether Castro's assassination was being considered and here
is a staff paper excluding it, because someone asked them to
consider it?

15 Mr. Bundy. No, I think it's a simple statement of what
I would regard as a rationale assessment of the situation by
whoever the original author was, and certainly by the staff
man with respect to a subject that emerges directly from the
notion that he is an operational target, whatever that means
and goes on to say, but we don't mean assassination, because
it would make him a martyr, what other reasons against: that
there may be. It doesn't seem to me that you can read the
statement that assassination is excluded as an inference that
somebody else is including it.

25 Mr. Kelley. That's all.

1 Mr. Schwarz. In any event, Mr. Bundy, the document says

2 it is excluded.

3 Mr. Kelley. That's right.

4 Mr. Schwarz. Now at that period of time in the fall of

5 1963, were you aware that through the offices of Ambassador

6 Atwood, or Mr. Atwood, as he may have then been called, and

7 through the offices of a French journalist called Jean Daniel,

8 another effort was being made to establish contact with Mr.

9 Castro?

10 Mr. Bundy. I remember the Atwood effort, as I recollect

11 that he came to see me about it. I don't recollect specifically

12 Jean Daniel, although it strikes a chord as you mention it.

13 Mr. Schwarz. What the purpose, very briefly, of Mr.

14 Atwood's effort?

15 Mr. Bundy. Well, as I understood it, he had been approached

16 by someone he knew from Cuba and had been given to understand

17 that there was interest in, Castro had an interest in, opening

18 communication, and he was exploring with us whether he could be

19 encouraged to undertake such an explanation.

20 Mr. Schwarz. And did you encourage him?

21 Mr. Bundy. The exact form of our message to him, or our

22 if you want to call it, the instruction to him, the President's

23 decision, I can no longer recollect, but my impression is that

24 we were interested, and that we did want him to explore it without

25 engaging the President any more than he could help.

1 Mr. Schwarz. But was the President in fact informed and 151

2 in fact approved the actions taken?

3 Mr. Bundy. That is my understanding.

4 Mr. Schwarz. Is it your understanding or your recollection?

5 Mr. Bundy. It is my recollection, but it is a recollection

6 that is refreshed by what I have learned and hearing more about

7 it in the last few days.

8 Mr. Schwarz. Now, were you told, in the fall of 1963,

9 that assassination devices had been requested by a Cuban for

10 the purpose of assassinating Mr. Castro, and that assassination

11 devices were offered to the Cuban in the fall of 1963?

12 Mr. Bundy. No.

13 Mr. Schwarz. Now again, here, calling for a matter of

14 opinion, as a matter of opinion, do you believe that at the

15 same time, at a possible rapprochement with Mr. Castro was being

16 pursued, the President would have authorized or permitted the

17 passage of assassination devices intended for their use on

18 Mr. Castro?

19 Mr. Bundy. Absolutely not.

20 Mr. Schwarz. I have nothing further on Castro.

21 The Chairman. Is there more?

22 Mr. Schwarz. Well, on Trujillo and Diem, with respect to

23 Diem --

24 Mr. Smothers. Well, if you're going on to something else,

25 there are a couple of things.

1 Mr. Smothers. Mr. Bundy, I am going to read through this

2 memorandum and ask you a couple of questions about that. It's

3 a memorandum from Helms for the record on MONGOOSE.

4 Reading from this memorandum, Mr. Bundy, reading from

5 Paragraph 2: "The Attorney General" -- well, let me read the

6 entire paragraph.

7 "The Attorney General opened the meeting" we're talking

8 about a MONGOOSE meeting-- by expressing the general dissatis-

9 faction of the President," --"'dissatisfaction of the President'"

10 in quotes -- "with Operation MONGOOSE."

11 Mr. Bundy. What date are we at? The date?

12 Mr. Smothers. The date of the memorandum is 16 October

13 1962.

14 "He pointed out that the Operation had been underway for a

15 year, that the results were discouraging, that there had been

16 no acts of sabotage, and that even the one which had been

17 attempted had failed twice. He indicated that there had been

18 noticeable improvement during the year in the collection of

19 intelligence, but that other actions had failed to influence

20 significantly the course of events in Cuba. He spoke of the

21 weekly meetings of top officials on this problem, and again

22 noted the small accomplishments, despite the fact that Secre-

23 taries Rusk and McNamara, General Taylor, McGeorge Bundy and he

24 personally had all been charged by the President with finding

25 a solution. He traced the history of General Lansdale's personal

1 appointment by the President a year ago.

2 "The Attorney General then stated that in view of this

3 lack of progress, he was going to give Operation MONGOOSE more

4 personal attention. In order to do this, he would hold a meeting

5 every morning at 0930 with the MONGOOSE operational representa-

6 tives from the various agencies (Lansdale, Harvey, Hurwich,

7 Ryan and General Johnson)."

8 Now, the best of our information, Mr. Bundy, is that these

9 meetings were in fact held on a daily basis as indicated, and

10 that they did involve Lansdale and these members of the working

11 group noted.

12 Were you aware of such meetings?

13 Mr. Bundy. I have no independent recollection of them, but

14 that does not sound implausible to me at all.

15 Mr. Smothers. It doesn't sound implausible to me that the

16 Attorney General Lansdale and members of the working group to

17 develop MONGOOSE activities with him?

18 Mr. Bundy. To report to him how they were getting on, and

19 to see if he couldn't, by listening to those reports and keeping

20 a lively -- keeping his lively concern in their consciousness
move the thing more rapidly.

21 Mr. Smothers. This is your interpretation of giving more

22 personal attention to it?

23 Mr. Bundy. Exactly.

24 Mr. Smothers. You say you had no knowledge of these in

1 1962?

2 Mr. Bundy. I didn't say that. I said I had no independent

3 recollection of them.

4 Mr. Smothers. They did not come to your attention at that

5 point?

6 Mr. Bundy. I didn't say say that. I don't know that they

7 did, but I don't know that they didn't.

8 Mr. Smothers. But your recollection at this point is that

9 they did not come to your attention?

10 Mr. Bundy. That is not my recollection. I don't recall

11 that one way or the other.

12 Mr. Smothers. Okay.

13 Let me ask you then about your knowledge of the Lansdale

14 situation.

15 Do you know General Lansdale?

16 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

17 Mr. Smothers. Do you know his reputation for truth and

18 honesty?

19 Mr. Bundy. I don't think I have any -- his reputation for

20 truth and honesty, if you ask me the question as one asks it

21 about, you know, all kinds of people, I have no reason to

22 question it. I have doubts about some of the things I have

23 seen attributed to him in recent weeks.

24 Mr. Smothers. Well, let me put it this way. Would you

25 believe General Lansdale under oath?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 159

TOP SECRET

156

1 Mr. Bundy. It would depend on what he said.

2 Mr. Smothers. It would depend upon what he said.

3 Is your experience that General Lansdale is trustworthy

4 only on a selective basis?

5 Mr. Bundy. You are asking me questions about matters

6 essentially in which his testimony, as I have seen it reported.

7 Mr. Smothers. No, I am not asking you about his testimony.

8 I am asking you if you would believe him under oath, based on

9 your knowledge.

10 Mr. Bundy. It would depend upon what he said, and if it

11 was a matter on which I had my own knowledge.

12 Mr. Smothers. Without regard to matters that General

13 Lansdale has testified to before this Committee, based on your

14 knowledge of him, your working relationship with him, your

15 knowledge of what other people know of General Lansdale, his

16 reputation in the community, if you will, would you believe him

17 under oath?

18 Mr. Bundy. I would currently have to say that I could not

19 give you a definite affirmative answer to that question.

20 Mr. Smothers. That's fine.

21 Now, let's go back to the period of General Lansdale's

22 appointment.

23 General Lansdale was appointed as the coordinator of the

24 Special Group, the Chief of Operations.

25 After General Taylor's efforts had been under effort for

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 160

TOP SECRET

40

1 some time, six months, seven months, General Taylor comes in,

2 I believe, in July after he completes his Bay of Pigs examina-

3 tion, General Lansdale is appointed by the President at the end

4 of November.

5 Do you have any present recollection of the circumstances

6 surrounding that appointment?

7 Mr. Bundy. None that goes beyond what I discussed earlier.

8 Mr. Smothers. To the best of your knowledge or recollection,

9 did the appointment of this Chief of Staff or Chief of Operations

10 reflect any lack of confidence in General Taylor on the part of

11 either the Attorney General or the President?

12 Mr. Bundy. No, the opposite. General Taylor had heavy

13 responsibilities in his general responsibility as military

14 representative of the President. He was made Chairman of the

15 Committee to keep oversight on this. It was inappropriate

16 entirely in terms of his rank and his other duties that he

17 should be the day to day action officer.

18 Mr. Smothers. Are you familiar with the degree of General

19 Taylor's involvement with the development of the Special

20 Group (Augmented) agendas? Was this done by General Taylor?

21 Was it really General Lansdale's responsibility?

22 Mr. Bundy. I don't have any knowledge of the details of

23 the operations of the staff. It was clear to me, and I think

24 to everyone else, that the man in charge of that operation, of

25 that Committee, was General Taylor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 161

41

158

1 Mr. Smothers. Okay.

2 Just one final series of questions.

3 If we might, Mr. Bundy, go back to our conversations

4 regarding your request to see documents prior to your testimony

5 before the Rockefeller Commission, when you talked to Mr.

6 Kissinger, precisely what did you request of him?

7 Mr. Bundy. I said to him -- and again I cannot be precise --

8 and I thought that there were going to be questions with respect

9 to which it would be much easier for me to give helpful and more

10 accurate answers if I could have access to appropriate documents

11 since I have taken no documents of that character, no official

12 documents of that character, from the White House. And he said

13 he entirely agreed and he made the appropriate arrangements.

14 Mr. Smothers. Did you ask for a timeframe for these

15 documents?

16 Mr. Bundy. I don't recall that I did, but when I came to

17 look more closely at what I needed to see, as I told you

18 earlier, it related specifically to the period around August

19 1962.

20 Mr. Smothers. Did the White House make the selection of

21 documents for you?

22 Mr. Bundy. No. The White House handed me a file of

23 documents which covered the period.

24 Mr. Smothers. They handed you a file of documents covering

25 roughly the August 1962 period?

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 162

TOP SECRET

1 Mr. Bundy. That's right.

2 Mr. Smothers. Had you made a request for documents

3 covering this August '62 timeframe?

4 Mr. Bundy. I must have told him the rough period with
5 which I am concerned. Again, I don't understand the drift of

6 your question.

7 Mr. Smothers. Well, the drift of my question is, if indeed
8 you selected the August 1962 documents, why did you select

9 that?

10 Mr. Bundy. Because Counsel to the Rockefeller Commission

11 had directed my attention to the period.

12 Mr. Smothers. To August 1962?

13 Mr. Bundy. Yes.

14 Mr. Smothers. In the file that centered roughly on this

15 point in this timeframe, included NSA memo 181, was the file

16 put together by the White House pursuant to this guidance?

17 Mr. Bundy. The file that came into my hands, whether

18 they put it together or whether it was a file drawn off the

19 shelf, I can't tell you. You'll have to ask them.

20 Mr. Smothers. Did it appear to you to be an off-the-shelf

21 file?

22 Mr. Bundy. I don't know what it was.

23 The Chairman. What is the object of this series of

24 questions, Curtis?

25 Mr. Smothers. Well, I am trying to determine, Mr. Chairman',

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 163

43

160

1 what Mr. Kissinger was requested to do and what actually
2 happened.

3 The Chairman. Don't we have that now in the record?

4 It just seems to me like we're going over the same series of
5 questions.

6 Mr. Smothers. Well, since we don't know what was in the
7 file --

8 Mr. Bundy. Well, I thought I said the file was a file of
9 National Security Action memoranda, a file which you already
10 have here.

11 Mr. Smothers. Relating to August, 1962?

12 Mr. Bundy. Uh-huh.

13 Mr. Smothers. That's all I have, Mr. Chairman.

14 Mr. Schwarz. On the Trujillo matter --

15 Mr. Bundy. Sure.

16 Mr. Schwarz. You know Mr. Trujillo was killed. Did you
17 know or do you know that the persons who killed him had
18 obtained some weapons from the United States?

19 Mr. Bundy. I did not know, and do not now know, of my
20 own knowledge that that was the case.

21 I did know, or at least I believe I must have been on
22 notice because of documents again that you have shown me, that
23 weapons by a decision of the Special Group in early January
24 had been or were being passed to Dominican dissidents.

25 Mr. Schwarz. Were you involved in the sending of a telegram

1 to the Domincan Republic, either two or three days prior to the
2 actual assassination of Mr. Trujillo?

3 Mr. Bundy. I have no recollection of it, and when I saw
4 those telegrams in discussions with your staff, they stirred no
5 recollection on my part.
6 Mr. Schwarz. Is it fair to state that Mr. Richard Goodwin
7 is the best witness on those subjects from the White House for
8 that period of time?
9 Mr. Bundy. It appears that way to me, although that
10 appears more from the fact that important. documents seem to
11 have been addressed to him than because of my own recollection
12 that he was interested in the matters and because of my phone
13 conversation with him, he showed a considerable familiarity
14 with events in the Domincan Republic, political events during
15 that spring.

16 Mr. Schwarz. Well, you got a memo from Mr. Bissell in
17 February, 17th February '61. It is Tab R of the Trujillo
18 Book 1 of 2, in which you were informed that the dissidents
19 had been told by the United States that it was prepared to
20 provide them with a limited supply of arms and equipment.

21 When you got such information, did it trigger in your mind
22 anything to the effect of, let's be concerned about how they're.
24 going to use those weapons, or did you just accept the informa-
24 tion and do nothing about it?

25 Mr. Bundy. It is clear that the information was sent to

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 165

TOP SECRET

45 162

1 me and it was clear, in that sense, that I had become responsi-
2 ble for knowing what was in the document, but I have to say that
3 as I reread it I have no recollection that I ever, in fact, did
4 read it at the time. Whether that was because of the flow, the
5 very heavy flow of other documents or because I passed it to
6 someone else or because I just simply didn't get to it, I cannot
7 tell you, but I have no recollection' that I saw it.

8 Mr. Schwarz. You did make a request for a briefing paper?
9 Mr. Bundy. It must have been done, and it was either done
10 in my name or I did it.

11 Mr. Schwarz. So you're not capable -- you don't remember
12 it. Are you capable of making a comment on my question, which
13 was having received information that arms had been supplied --
14 Mr. Bundy. Having that information on my desk, anyway.
15 Mr. Schwarz. Okay.

16 In the light of hindsight, should persons in your position
17 when they receive such information inquire into the purpose for
18 which the arms are to be used?

19 Mr. Bundy. Yes, I would -- and my own guess on this, and
20 it's not much better than that, is that the decision which had
21 been taken only a week before the new Administration came in,
22 in the Special Group, was partly reviewed in some fashion, with
23 the Special Group as reconstituted after the change in
24 Administration. So I would have to say that I suppose I knew
25 that weapons were being introduced into the Dominican Republic

46

1 and I would have to add that I did not, or I have no recollection

2 and I think I would recollect it, if I had engaged in a careful

3 inquiry to find out just what, who, when where and so on did

4 not do that, and I think -- you ask in hindsight, I think it

5 would clearly be important to have that kind of understanding,

6 because as I understand the evidence that has now been developed,

7 there was a level of communication and connection with the

8 plotters in the Dominican Republic which exceeded what political

9 authority appears to have expected or believed was going on.

10 Mr. Schwarz. Would you agree with one further point,

11 that it is very difficult for the United States to control

12 events once it has made a decision to cooperate with dissident

13 elements, and in particular once it's made a decision to

14 cooperate with dissident elements by providing them with arms?

15 Mr. Bundy. I think that -- one thing, I don't want to

16 generalize here, but I think -- I would agree with the generali-

17 zation, let me put it that way, if I could add that in the case

18 of the Dominican Republic, I think one has also to recognize

19 retrospectively that there was no way to have any communication

20 with dissidents that would not involve recognition that, if you

21 propose to be an effective dissident in that country under that

22 ruler, you would probably be contemplating fairly violent

23 action.

24 Mr. Schwarz. I have nothing further on Trujillo.

25 One question of Vietnam.

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

TOP SECRET

1 You were involved in the question of the possible coup in Vietnam that actually took place?

2 Mr. Bundyrz.Yes.

3 Mr. Schwarz. And you were substantially involved in that as a matter of personal

4 Mr. Bundy. I was working closely with the President and was probably the draftsman under his instruction of some of the cables that went out.

5 Mr. Schwarz. Now, Diem was killed. It does not appear to me from the record that the United States wanted him killed.

6 Is that fair?

7 Mr. Bundy. That is correct.

8 Mr. Schwarz. But the United States did want him deposed if a coup could be successful? Is that correct?

9 Mr. Bundy. The United States, really had two views. Right up to the end, the United States hoped, hoped against hope, as it became more and more difficult to communicate with Diem, that he would see the, or come to share the kinds of argument, that were made to him, primarily by Ambassador Lodge, and that a change in his government and alslower, much lower, role for his brother and sister-in-law would assist him in recapturing public confidence. That was always the preferred solution.

10 As prospects for that became more and more dim, the United States did come to take the view that there might be no alternative to a coup, and it certainly had the view that if there

TOP SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

TOP SECRET

48
1 was going to be a coup, I believe the language somewhere in
2 one of the cables is that it was in the interests of the United
States 3 that it should succeed.
4 Mr. Schwarz. Now, on the day of the coup, Ambassador
5 Lodge told Mr.Diem that he would provide help to get him out
6 of the country and do so by airplane, but he couldn't have the
7 plane for twenty-four hours. Adid you know of the twenty-four
8 hour point?

9 Mr. Bundy. I don't remember that we did.

10 Mr. Schwarz. B, don't you find it incomprehensible that
11 the United States was not able to supply an airplane for
12 twenty-four hours?

13 Mr. Bundy. I don't really know because it depends on
14 where the plane was going to go, what kind of plane. I don't
15 think I'm competent to answer that question.

16 What occurs to me is, there were lots of other ways of
17 offering asylum for a twenty-four hour period, and I don't
18 think I really find that a very significant point.

19 The Chairman. Any further questions?

20 If there are no further questions, I want to thank you
21 for your testimony, it has been long, a very long morning, and
22 it has been very helpful testimony. We appreciate it very
23 much.

24 Mr. Bundy. And I am thankful to you, Mr. Chairman

25 Mr. Chairman, if it is not inappropriate and there is no

2 the Press which will simply re-emphasize to them what I think

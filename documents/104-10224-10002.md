A
favored by the KAMP career
Washington during October that
he is quite strong. I have disc.
and while he has accepted it with
his usual unfailing and commendable well-disciplined decency, he cannot.
of course, feel a certain disappointment and this action cannot
help but raise grave doubts in his mind exactly what.
KUBARK can look forward to. Although he has not bowed
any request or comment that might raise serious comment in pro
motion, I would like to submit for your consideration the following
comments concerning him. He is in fact an excellent and valuable
officer. While it is quite true that he is in all probability still new
be earning the very small percentage of outstandingly competent officers
in KUBARK, I consider him well above the average and certainly a more
valuable officer in many ways than the average GO-13. His judgment, is based not on
traits which are exceptional but on his consistent day-to-day contribution
to the operations and administration of the Base and with the full reali
zation of the fact that quite properly KUBARK promotions are often
being granted on much stricter standards than in the past, I still
will never be completely at his best in the direct handling of agent cases
of agent cases, he has shown far more competence at this time than many
officers and there are numerous responsible positions that I.

is a mature, experienced individual who has handled many.

He was recently (17 September 1966) commended by
not only of performance in connection with the operation but as a

reflection of his consistent performance since he was rehabilitated in
August 1966. The recommended promotion of
was firmly advocated
on 31 January 1968 and was warmly concurred in by CCG. Further, while
I do not believe that Stan in grade should only rise by a min
imium time service with KUBARK and that fact that he has spent
present grade for almost 11 years substantially increase the equities
in favor of his promotion at this time. Considering the above factors
and as a supervisor who deals with efficiency and tact, I am

I would hope that the action of the Career Service Board in this case be reconsidered at this time.

3. If you agree and if you consider it appropriate I would appreciate your resubmitting this case immediately to the Career Service Board with a strong request that their approval action be reverted. If you do not concur or if you feel that this is not a sound move for tactical or other reasons, I would appreciate your advice as to acceptable timing on resubmitting this promotion. As a matter of interest, I would appreciate some matter of the reasoning of the W.C. Career Service Board in disapproving the promotion.

# Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: 050 Promotion Board Attn: Mr.

DATE: 10 May 1949

FROM: Acting Chief, FDZ

SUBJECT: Promotion of Mr. David E. Murphy

Attachment: 1. Dispatch, Tokyo to Chief, FDZ, Subject: Promotion of David S. Murphy, ZJTA-463, dated 21 April 1949

1. Attachment 1. forwards a recommendation for promotion of Mr. David Murphy, intelligence officer, CAF-12, Military Liaison Unit, Tokyo.

2. The Branch fully endorses the estimate of Mr. Murphy's qualifications and accomplishments set forth in Attachment 1. He is one of our most industrious and accomplished case officers. With respect to his promotion at this time the following considerations are pointed out:

a. He has been in the grade of CAF-12 since 5 April 1948. This is five months short of the minimum time in grade necessary to be considered for promotion.

b. While reorganization of our Field T/O's in the Far East will come about in the next several months, there is at present no CAF-13 slot in the Tokyo Liaison Unit.

c. To consider Mr. Murphy for promotion as a general intelligence officer of this grade he would have to be considered capable of taking over a branch or division and as a rule proven as a chief of a fairly large field establishment. While the subject may potentially have qualifications for these his experience within the organization has not yet included such assignments.

3. It is recommended that subject not be considered for promotion at this time.

CONFIDENTIAL!

1.  As Mr. David E. Murphy, CS-18, retires on 31 July 1975, he will have completed some 33 years of Federal service, 27 of which have been with the Agency. His record has been an outstanding one in all respects. His accomplishments and the level and range of responsibilities he has exercised fully warrant the award of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal in recognition thereof.

2.  Mr. Murphy brought to the Agency from his previous military and civilian experience and study, a knowledge of the Russian language and of the Soviet system. It was in the field of Soviet operations that he rapidly made his mark, first in Japan and then in Germany. His incisive mind, vitality, enthusiasm, imagination, managerial talent and keen analytical ability led to early recognition on the part of his superiors that Mr. Murphy was an outstanding officer with very high potential. By 1954, he had risen to the position of DCOB, Berlin and in 1959 became Chief of that large and important base. He distinguished himself there. In recognition of his abilities and accomplishments he then rose successively to the position of DC/EE Division, C/FE Division, C/SR Division and C/SE Division. Each assignment was one of increasing responsibility and challenge in the direction of efforts of the Clandestine Service and the Agency against our hardest targets. The laudatory fitness reports he received from top Agency management in these assignments clearly reflect the high professional regard in which he was held and convey the judgments of the major significance of the contributions he made to the Agency mission in support of U.S. policy and national security.

3.  After revitalizing and redirecting our Soviet program as C/SR and of the enlarged SB Division, Mr. Murphy. was appointed COS, Paris in 1968 and served in that position until 1974. His aix years in Paris were marked by steady progress in all areas of the missions and objectives assigned to that large and complex station and by the handling of delicate political and internal criuis situations in France effectively and to the benefit of the Agency and the United States. His analyses of the situation in France at times of tension and crisis were particularly remarked upon for their clarity, incisiveness and value to U.S. policy makers. For his leadership of the Paris Station, Mr. Murphy's performance was characterized as "Outstanding" in each of the years of his service there.

CONFIDENTIAL'

4. Mr. Murphy returned from France in 1974 and was assigned as a National Intelligence Officer with responsibility to the DCI in the area of Special Activities. He has served in this assignment of high trust and responsibility until his retirement.

5. Mr. Murphy's long, distinguished career has been exceptional in contributing to the mission of the Agency both operationally and substantively. His dedication, drive and intelligence led to high achievement in all of his assignments and to his being entrusted with ever- increasing responsibilities. It is strongly recommended that he be awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal in recognition of his outstanding service in the CIA.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Under Mr. Murphy's leadership the Paris Station became very operationally oriented, concentrating on high priority targets, and much exceptionally fine intelligence and counterintelligence production resulted. I have some doubt that these operational successes - as outstanding as they were - really required the total number of personnel of all categories who were committed to them. Nevertheless, Mr. Murphy made Paris a shining example for all other large stations.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: David E. Murphy

Employee No.: 056700; Grade: GS-18; DOB:
23 June 1921; Chief of Station, Paris;
Months under my Supervision: 14; Feriod
under Review: 1 April 1973-1 June 1974.

OVERALL RATING: OUTSTANDING

1. At the end of May 1974, Mr. Murphy will leave Paris after a most successful six-year assignment as Chief of Station. He distinguished himself by having molded this Station into a cohesive, well-disciplined, and highly productive unit. I reiterate my evaluation of Mr. Murphy as, overall, the most effective chief of a major station in the European Division. His earlier fitness reports and his excellent record in Paris attest to this.

2. In the past year under Mr. Murphy's direction, the Paris Station has continued to make significant progress on all major fronts. As examples, I can cite two direct Soviet recruitment attempts, an imaginative effort to get closer to several other primary Soviet targets, a perceptible improvement in our French liaison relationships, a marked increase in both quality and quantity of priority economic intelligence reporting, the acquisition of new sources to cover the French internal scene, and a revitalization of several existing assets into producers of valuable intelligence. Although normally most of the credit for such achievements rests with the individual operations officers concerned, in Mr. Murphy's case he personally becomes involved in each


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 139

Murphy, David E.

operation and therefore the cited progress is a direct reflection of Mr. Murphy's talent and skill as a dynamic operational manager. Paris is a sprawling metropolitan area where operating obstacles, particularly those relating to access to majer targets, are further exacerbated by sporadic French scrutiny of our activities. It is therefore all the more noteworthy that the progress made by the Station has been accomplished without any embarrassing flaps through Mr. Murphy's insistence that the highest standards of tradecraft be practiced by Station personnel and by visiting case officers.

3. Mr. Murphy can take considerable personal pride in his record in Paris. His personal concern with all areas of Station activity and his common sense approach to both operational and administrative matters are indicative of this officer's competence as one of this Agency's most gifted and thoroughly professional senior officers. His wide range of interests, his wealth of operational engagement, his ability to make well-reasoned and prompt decisions, his aggressiveness, and his persuasiveness are all hallmarks of Mr. Murphy's superb performance. Although Mr. Murphy shows a lively impatience with bureaucratic roadblocks and cogently articulates his views on all issues, his correspondence with Headquarters is invariably presented factually and in a dignified and unemotional tone; this I have appreciated and would like to add that Mr. Murphy promptly implements Headquarters guidelines and decisions.

4. Mr. Murphy's performance clearly merits the rating of OUSTANDING.

Career; Chief of Station, Paris; Service
Designation: D; Period under Review: 10 Jan 1972
to 31 March 1973; Months under my Supervision: 15

OVERALL RATING: OUTSTANDING

1. Given the size of the Paris Station and the complexity of its diverse activities, on overall performance Mr. Murphy is rated as the most effective Station Chief in the European Division area. In the period under review, substantial progress has been made against all operational targets. Under Mr. Murphy's tutelage particularly noteworthy accomplishments are noted in the Soviet field against human targets and on a superbly executed technical penetration; in the area of liaison where Mr. Murphy has almost single-handedly developed productive relationships at senior levels and as testament to his efforts, successfully enlisted outstanding liaison support to a delicate CI investigation of primary interest to this Organization; and more recently, Mr. Murphy has effectively harnessed Station resources and assets to collect timely intelligence on economic topics, to move forward in the effort to thwart terrorism, and to furnish valuable reporting on the critical French elections of March 1973. Under his direction, the Station has acquired a number of productive and responsive assets in the past year, while other operational programs have improved upon their high quality/intelligence production record.

2. Mr. Murphy is a thoroughly professional senior intelligence officer who plays a very active role in practically all of the Station's operational activities. His incisiveness and keen analytical talent enable him to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

# SECRET

Murphy, David E.

make sound and well-reasoned judgments. It is to Mr. Murphy's credit that all Paris-based operations are run with the highest degree of professionalism and adherence to strict tradecraft procedures. Mr. Murphy has also asssired a wealth of knowledge and background on the local political scene; this is considered a valuable requisite for target-ting purposes, for briefings and for maintaining his excellent relations with senior Embassy officers, including the Ambassador.

3. Given his long service in the European area and his grasp of European problems confronting the Division, exchanges with Mr. Murphy both personal and through correspondence have been extremely helpful in formulating Division operational policy.

4. Mr. Murphy clearly merits an overall rating of OUTSTANDING.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 1 April 1971 to 9 January 1972

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 41 months

OVERALL RATING : Outstanding

My feeling that Dave Murphy has done an outstanding job as Chief of Station, Paris is so amply documented in the preceding Fitness Reports that this final report before I leave the Division need not be lengthily repetitive. It is useful to record, however, that during the last half of this year his Station has been deeply involved in the reporting and analysis of some highly sensitive developments on the French political scene. Much of the analysis of this situation has been handled by Dave himself, and has proven of real significance to our highest level customers. We have briefed a number of ranking officials in Washington on Dave's findings, and they have been uniformly appreciative. Dave therefore deserves credit for alerting Washington to a difficult situation concerning which the U.S. Government has had little or no information except from this Agency's sources.

Mr. Murphy's performance continues to be Outstanding.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)

I first met Mr. Murphy following the assumption of my present duties at the end of March 1973. Therefore, I am in a position to comment on his performance only during the last seven months covered by this report. During that time, Mr. Murphy's performance has been thoroughly outstanding in every respect. During his years in France, ho has developed a real expertise on this country, both in terms of how it functions and with regard to the manner in which Franco looks at the world.

Mr. Murphy has effectively directed and coordinated a large staff, and I have been particularly gratified at the extent to which his staff coordinates its reporting with other interested elements of the Mission. I am told by my DCM that, based on his experience, the coordination between Mr. Murphy's office and the substantive sections of the Embassy is better at this post than at any post he has known or heard of. This is in large part a direct tribute to Mr. Murphy's leadership.

I find I am calling increasingly on Mr. Murphy's advice in the preparation of Embassy assessments on a broad range of policy issues, His contributions have been perceptive and, by and large, accurate.

I consider Mr. Murphy one of a handful of my closest advisors in the Mission and hold him in the highest regard.

In my opinion, David Murphy has done an outstanding job during the period covered by this report.

I arrived to take up my duties as DCM in this Embassy in December 1971. However, since that time I have served as Chargé on a number of occasions and while, when the Ambassador was present, the Ambassador preferred to deal directly with Mr. Murphy and, as a result I had only collateral dealings with him, I feel I had more than ample opportunity to observe his performance and evaluate it. I can say without hesitation whatsoever that he performed in a superb manner during a particularly difficult period. He deserves top marks not only for his own performance but for the manner in which he directed those operations here in France for which he has had the responsibility.

III. Mr. Murphy is an outstading officer in every sense. His advice and counsel have been of the utmost value to me and my executive staff throughout this rating period. He has excellent judgement, a quick mind and a thorough knowledge of France and French politics. And he has common sense, as well as a good sense of humor. His personal conduct is impeccable; his behavior, gentlemanly.

Mr. Murphy is widely known and respected in the French official and diplomatic community. His contacts are numerous and useful. He and his wife make an excellent representational team. He speaks excellent French.

Mr. Murphy's relations with other senior officers at the Embassy are cordial and harmonious. He is a good administrator and is well-liked by his subordinates, as well as his collegues.

In sum, I am delighted to have Mr. Murphy on my staff and consider him an officer of the highest calibre.

1. During the reporting period, Mr. Murphy has continued his usual virtuoso performance. The Station has been very heavily occupied in one degree or another against most of the hardest targets, and Mr. Murphy has been fully on top of everything that has gone on.

2. Particularly worthy of note is the manner in which Mr. Murphy has raised the level of our liaison in France, taking advantage among other factors of a change for the better in the leadership of the external service. Although this situation has certainly been favorable. it could not have been exploited so fully had it not been for Mr. Murphy's rare combination of charm, persuasiveness, and a superb professional background.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 1 April 1969 to 31 March 1970

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 20 months

OVER-ALL RATING : Outstanding

1. Mr. Murphy has been Chief of Station, Paris, for approximately twenty months. During his tenure, this, perhaps the most difficult of all stations, has become a rationally deployed, well-articulated and generally successful organization for perhaps the first time in its history. Intensive efforts are being mounted against virtually all assigned targets with satisfying success, in some cases producing unique results. Liaison relationships, which began to thaw before de Gaulle's departure from Government, are now reasonably cordial and, above all, useful. Most of the credit for the splendid progress that has been made is directly due to Mr. Murphy himself.

2. Dave Murphy is completely oriented toward operational achievement. He has an incisive mind, enormous vitality, and enthusiasm. He is positive, impatient, forceful and articulate. He can absorb and integrate detail, and bring focus on difficult problems. He inspires both colleagues and subordinates to give their best efforts. He is fully responsive to guidance and indeed will often seize the initiative when new courses of action are indicated.

3. It would be difficult to describe the minor miracle that Mr. Murphy has wrought as anything short of outstanding.

23 June 1921; Chief of Station;
Career; Service Designation: D.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 1 April 1968 - 31 March 1969

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 12

OVERALL RATING : Outstanding

1. Long before Mr. Murphy departed for Paris in June 1968, he began preparing himself for this assignment as Chief of Station by reading files, interviewing personnel, and discussing cases. As a result, on arrival in Paris he was already well oriented concerning the Station's problems and had formulated plans for revitalizing it.

2. The entire year in Paris has of course been over- shadowed by the Vietnam Peace Conference and a large proportion of the Station's effort has perforce been devoted to supporting the U.S. delegation. The Station has responded exceptionally well to this demand though it has forced a slow-down in normal Station activities.

3. A number of other events have also taken place in France or concerning France which have forced the Station during the past nine months to perform firemen's duty -- the May-June riots which extended into August, the dissolution of the Assembly and re-election of deputies, the Czech crisis beginning 21 August, the December monetary crisis, the Near East crisis, continued student unrest, the President's trip and currently the problems precipitated by DeGaulle's resignation. All of these developments have been covered amazingly well.

4. While the exceptional events enumerated above have forced the Station to concentrate its efforts on the immediate issues, Mr. Murphy nonetheless proceeded with the longer range goals of the Station. He has worked at improving re- lations with the French Services, personally becoming deeply


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 156

- 2 -

involved even in routine liaison activity. Consequently, our relations during the past nine months with the French have improved considerably. This improvement can partially be attributed to a reawakening on the part of the French Government to the Communist and *New Left* threat (which was brought into focus by the May-June riots) but it was also in large measure due to Mr. Murphy's concerted efforts to cultivate selected officials, initiate substantive discussions and increase our own level of exchange with the Services.

5. Operations against the Communist Party have been re-activated with emphasis on the international aspects of the Party, particularly support of subversion abroad. Operations against the large Soviet and Chinese targets are beginning to move ahead. Production-wise, the take from both unilateral sources and liaison increased significantly during 1968. We expect further increase in 1969.

6. There are still many weak spots in the Paris Station and many refinements and adjustments to be made. But Mr. Murphy has made an exceptional beginning; the Station is moving in the right direction and during this coming fiscal year we should begin to see the worth of the programs which are being so energetically pursued by him. Without question, his performance has been *Outstanding*.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES, CONTENT AND METHODS

The COS Seminar is aimed to prepare prospective Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of Station and Chiefs of Base for field assignments. Emphasis was upon the difficulties confronting Chiefs of small or medium-sized installations, since they must handle a peculiarly wide range of problems. Included were case studies serving to remind outgoing chiefs of various operational approaches and techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordination, management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of the Chief of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large, at home and abroad.

The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services discussed. A few key items of suggested reading are included, and bibliographies of suggested reading tailored to the individual's assignment are offered for those who want them.

**SECTION B**

SUBJECT: Mr. David E. Murphy

1.  This report covers the performance of Mr. Murphy as Chief of the SR Division for the past year.

2.  The past year has seen a measurable increase in the work load of the SR Division, with no let up in the energetic efforts of the Division to accomplish its mission. A number of new audio operations have come into being and the support rendered the Division by the other area divisions has been a reflection of the success of Mr. Murphy's program to enlist the interest and the energies of the other area divisions in attacking one of our principal targets.

3.  Mr. Murphy has now assumed new responsibilities as chief of a substantially enlarged division including the satellites as well as the Soviet Union. This is a tribute to his own *outstanding* management of his division as well as a recognition of the close operational interrelationship between Soviet and satellite activities.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT
(For the period ending 31 March 1965)

SUBJECT: Mr. David E. Murphy

1. This report is the first full year report of Mr. Murphy's performance as Chief of the SR Division.

2. Perhaps his greatest contribution during this past year has been the energizing of the Division's several components with a consequent very noticeable increase in the efforts of the Clandestine Services as a whole against our Soviet targets. Mr. Murphy's enthusiasm and imagination have been contagious, and we are as a result profiting from his sound approach to the role and mission of his Division. He has fully understood the fact that the SR Division cannot alone discharge the responsibilities of the Clandestine Services for intelligence and counter-intelligence activity against our Soviet requirements, but must harness the interest and the energies of all the area divisions. In this respect, Mr. Murphy is achieving nothing short of remarkable success. His arrangements with DODS are also improving the quality of that Division's work in the SR field, while his general administration of his Division from a managerial point of view has continued to be excellent.

3. The overall evaluation of Mr. Murphy's performance during this past year, including his regard for cost and manpower factors, is outstanding. It is because of the quality of this performance that favorable consideration has been given in principle to the gradual investraent of an increasing portion of the inanpower assets of the Clandestine Services to his Division. His plans and his accomplish- ments to date justify confidence that these increases are being well invested and will provide a maximum return,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT
(For the period ending 31 March 1964)

SUBJECT: Mr. David E. Murphy

1.  Mr. Murphy relinquished his duties as Chief, Eastern Europe Division in September 1963 and took over his present responsibilities as Chief of the SR Division at that time. This report coverg the period from 1 April 1963 to the present and thus includes comments on his performance as Chief, EE Division and Chief, SR Division.

2.  Mr. Murphy combines an extraordinary talent for this work with a considerable and varied experience in it. His previous report indicated that he was turning in an outstanding performance in dealing with the affairs of the EE Division, and he continued this level of his performance in the first six months covered by this report. A general reorganization of senior officers in the Clandestine Services offered the opportunity to put Mr. Murphy in charge of the division which he had long aspired to direct and for which position he was eminently qualified, both linguistically and by field experience. He is showing excellent results in refurbishing the Division and giving it new life and impetus. His considerable energies enable him to give an outstanding performance in managing and directing his Division's affairs while at the same time engaging personally and most actively in a number of very important Divisional cases. His competence includes awareness of the need for keeping his costs down and getting the maximum from his manpower. He is showing imagination and initiative and is probably the best qualified and best prepared officer ever to head the Division.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Fitness Report - Mr. David E. Murphy

1.  This memorandum is in lieu of the Fitness Report Form on Mr. Murphy and covers the period from 1 April 1962 through 31 March 1963, during which Mr. Murphy has served as Chief of the Eastern Europe Division.

2.  After a long series of assignments dating from April 1948 and involving duty at Tokyo, Yokosuka, Karlsruhe and Berlin where he served as Chief of Base of that important installation, Mr. Murphy returned to Headquarters in August 1961 as Deputy Chief of the EE Division and became Chief of that Division in June 1962. I should like to quote from the fitness report on Mr. Murphy written at the time he was assuming his new responsibilities as Chief of EE Division: "There is every reason to believe that Mr. Murphy will manage the EE Division in the same outstanding manner with which he won the ungrudging respect of the Berlin community as the leader of American intelligence in that area." A previous fitness report covering his first year as Chief of Base, Berlin is equally laudatory.

3.  In his responsibility for streamlining and improving the effectiveness of his Division in both its headquarters and overseas postures, Mr. Murphy has been energetic and imaginative. He is an authority on the situation in West Germany but particularly in Berlin and has played a highly useful role in government councils on these problems. He has excellent working knowledge of Russian, French and German, and his operational experience as a result


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

of his field assignments is truly extensive.

4. In conducting the affairs of his Division during this past year, Mr. Murphy has without question borne out the prediction that he would turn in an outstanding performance. He has done this and continues to do it.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: David E. Murphy

1. Murphy's performance since he became COB Berlin last sumer must be almost as well known to Headquarters as it is to me. His projected assignment as Deputy Chief EE, then the realization that his continuation in Berlin is essential, and later still his detail to the Paris senterence as the KUBARK referent on Berlin all recognise different aspects of his remarkably high qualifications.

2. As COB Beriin he is a worthy successor to William K. Harvey; he 15 fully en top of the job. This was expected, but in addition he has shown an astonishing virtuosity in the field of coordination, in antch his pioneering work has set a fine example for the rest of KUBANK overseas. In a few months he learned more about the totality of American Intelligence in Berlin than anyone would have supposed possible; then he used his knowledge with great diplomatic skill to bring about one improvement alter another. The successful reform of the Marienfelde situation fallosed his suggestions, sith the whole community willingly cooperating once he had demonstrated the advantages to be gained. He knows more of both the big pleture and the small details of Army operations than the Army's own local commander (to say nothing of ali nigher echelons) and with this anosledge has already Improved the Army's product, for examplo in providing detalled brief's which the Army system is not geared to supply. His grasa e tme whole subject, his ability either to generalize usefully or to go into deep detail as appropriate, nis speed and thoraganess in attacking the many problems are all demonstrated in the series of brilliant memorania anten have come from him tor many months. In addition I have several tie witnessed his tapressive skill in negotiation, in bilateral aiscussion wi one or other colleague In Sariin, in meetings of the ICCD, in pipsentations before the lidhi, ant In particularly delicate dealings with Maj. General Van Natta. It is quite sicar that ne has to the ungrudging respect of the whole committy as the lealer of American fatelligence in Berlin.

performance was outstanding and he directed the operations of DOB
in a fully effective, well organized and thoroughly competent manner.
I have nothing further to add concerning great abilities

There is little to add to the comments in last Fitness Report, except to record his performance for the six month period since the submission of this report, during which period he has served as full-time Deputy Chief of Base and Chief of Operations and for appreciable periods as Acting Chief of Base. outstanding performance has continued during this period. He is a fully mature, capable, experienced, senior officer and one of the finest operations and intelligence officers I know in He possesses great drive and a complete grasp of the professional aspects of his assignment.

EXPLAIN FULLY:
While I do not consider that Subject is better suited for any other type of position than the one he now holds and the one that has been recommended for his next assignment, it should be pointed out that he is an unusually versatile officer capable of performing with distinction any one of a wide range of assignments; both in the field and at headquarters.

Directs as Branch Chief a large (7 officers and clerical employees) operational branch engaged in all phases of Soviet operations including handling some of the most complex and valuable such operations has.

Serves as Chief of Operations, Deputy Base Chief, and frequently Acting Chief of Base, BOB.

Duty No. 6:

Trains and develops younger officers on a supervisory and tutorial basis.

## Section C, Paragraph 3 (Narrative Description):

Subject is without question one of the most outstanding operations officers in CIA. He is distinguished by his drive, the incisiveness of his approach to operational and other problems, the depth of his operational understanding, the soundness of his operational judgment, and his broad, almost unique, knowledge of Soviet matters, particularly in the counter-espionage field. He is a brilliant CE officer, an outstanding agent handler, and an excellent executive, and has fully demonstrated his capabilities in all of these fields during the almost four

years he has been assigned to FOB. These abilities, plus his unusual language capabilities and his broad and detailed area knowledge, make Subject, in my opinion, one of the most valuable, versatile and effective officers in CIA. The only weaknesses I have noted in Subject during the almost four years that I have been completely and Intimately familiar with his work on a daily basis, are a tendency at times to be too impatient with other officers particularly those who do not begin to measure up to his very high standards of performance, and an occasional tendency to be somewhat undiplomatic in his handling of personnel. It should be clearly pointed out, however, that neither of these factors are of sufficient importance or weight to, in any material way, decrease the effectiveness of Subject's consistently fine performance and are, in my opinion, merely the Inevitable corollary of Subject's great drive and intense dedication to his profession. It also should be pointed out that while Subject is an exacting supervisor, he is never unreasonable nor in any sense dictatorial, and he has demonstrated the capacity of quickly developing, and retaining the full loyalty, cooperation and respect of the officers with whom he works. It is, I think, significant also that the respect which other officers hold for Subject increases in direct proportion to the level of professional competence and experience which these officers attain.

In assessing Subject's performance and capabilities, it should be pointed out that he has been officially recommended for promotion from grade GS-15 to grade G3-16 and that he has been officially recommended to succeed the present incumbent as Chief of Base, BOB. Further comments concerning Subject in this connection are contained in EGBT-1003 dated 28 September 1958, the covering dispatch to this Fitness Report, which should be read in conjunction therewith.

Section E. Paragraph 13:

This report In addition to being an Annual efficiency report should be read as a recapitulation and full analysis of Jubject's performance since his assigament to BOB in December 1954 and of his present capabilities and future potential in support of the official recommendation that he be promoted from grade GS-15 to grade 65-16 and that he be made Chief of Base, BOB, upon the departure of the present Incumbent.

Section G. Paragraph 4:

Subject has clearly demonstrated the potential for becoming a most senior executive. He is fully capable now of directing with full effectiveness a large, complex field Base or Station and, with the minimum of familiarization, capable of performing any one of a number of senior executive positions at Headquarters. I consider Subject to be one of that very small handful of most capable officers who should uitizately occupy the key executive positions in DDP

Section H, Paragraph 1:

Subject does not need additional training. It has been recommended that he be made Chier of Base, Berlin, for his next assignment. Upon the completion of that assignment he should, in my opinion, return to Headquarters and. If possible, assigned as Deputy Chief of a foreign area division with the view to his becoming Chief of such division at the appropriate time, or occupying another suitable post-tion of similar stature wir After a reasonable Headquarters' assignment within this framework ty, ghould, however, be reassigned to the field as Chief of a major station where his great abilities in the planning, development, and implementation of espionage and counter-espionage can be brought to bear with maximum impact. In any event, whatever assignment Subject may be given in the future, either at Headquarters or in the field, should involve direct operational and/or operational/supervisory responatoliities. Given the very small number of officers who have attained, or are likely to attain, Subject's level of competener. and given Sublet's intense personal preoccupation with the operational atde of work, I do not believe that can affent to use Subject on any non-operational or non-operational/supervisory asal algnment for any length of time.

In the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that address to some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. Placing an "X" in each category to allow you to make finer distinctions to tell us that the statement applies to the person.

Then assess the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person.

Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

# STATUS AND EFFICIENCY REPORT COVERING EACH CIVILIAN EMPLOYEE ON THE STAFF,

THE EFFICIENCY RATING AND TOWARD:

THE REPORTING OFFICER IS DEFINED AS THE EMPLOYEE'S IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR, IN OTHER WORDS THE PERSON WHO IS
PRIMARILY BEST ACQUAINTED WITH THE EMPLOYEE'S WORKING EFFICIENCY, HOWEVER, DEPENDING UPON CIRCUM
STANCES, THE CHIEF OF STATION MAY NOT WISH TO INTRUST THE IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR WITH THIS RESPONSIBILI
TY IN ANY CASE. THE CHIEF OF STATION WILL CHANGE OR MODIFY THE RATING OF THE REPORTING OFFICER WHEN
SUCH CHANGES UR MODIFICATIONS ARE CALLED FOR. THE CHIEF OF STATION IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
ACCURACY OF FACTS AND STATEMENTS WHICH APPEAR ON THE STATUS AND EFFICIENCY REPORT. IN MANY CASES, ES
PECIALLY IN A SMALL UNIT, THE CHIEF OF STATION MAY WISH TO FILL OUT ALL THE REPORTS HIMSELF.

IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL REPORT, THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL REPORTS, UTILIZING THE SAME FORM, WILL DE RENDER

1. 
A. UPON COMPLETION OF FIRST NINETY (90) DAYS OF SERVICE AT A STATION.

B. UPON RELIEF OR REASSIGNMENT OF REPORTING SENIOR.

C. UPON DETERMINATION OR RECOMMENDATION THAT AN EMPLOYEE IN A FIELD STATION SHOULD BE REASSIGNED TO AN
OTHER STATION OR RETURNES TO U.S. FOR REASSIGNMENT, OR OTHER DISPOSITION. SUCH REPORT WILL BE FORWARDED
SO AS TO REACH THE WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE AFTER SUCH REASSIGNMENT DETER
MINATION IS MADE. IF POSSIBLE, THE REPORT SHOULD BE SENT IN AT LEAST, THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO PROPOSED RE
ASSIGNMENT IN ORDER THAT ALL TIME POSSIBLE MAY BE DEVOTED TO APPRAISAL AND EVALUATION. IF CONSIDERATION
OF REASSIGNMENT IS BEING GIVEN WITHOUT EMPLOYEE'S KNOWLEDGE, ITEMS 1 TO 8 WILL BE FILLED IN AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE BY THE RATING OFFICER WITHOUT DEFERRAL TO EMPLOYEE.

2. IN FAIRNESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL BEING RATED AND IN THE INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE IMPORTANCE OF CAREFUL
   LY PREPARED AND ACCURATE EFFICIENCY REPORTS CANNOT BE OVERSTRESSED. THE FOLLOWING BASIC PRINCIPLES OF RATING SHOULD
   ALWAYS BE KEPT IN MIND:

A. ALWAYS BASE YOUR JUDGMENT ON:

(1) WHAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED THE INDIVIDUAL DO OR FAIL TO DO.

(2) TYPICAL PERFORMANCE. NOT ON AN ISOLATED STRIKING INCIDENT.

(3) EXAMPLES RELEVANT TO THE CHARACTERISTIC UNDER CONSIDERATION.

(A) THE EFFICIENCY REPORT IS TO BE USED TO RATE ALL CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES. BUT REPORTING OFFICERS
SHOULD BEAR IN MIND THAT DIFFERENT STANDARDS PREVAIL 19 DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS WHEREAS IT IS
NECESSARY, FOR EXAMPLE. THAT AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER POSSESS INITIATIVE. THIS SAME TRAIT IS
NOT ALWAYS DESIRABLE. EXCEPT IN A MINOR WAY, FOR A TYPIST. THE RATINGS AND EVALUATIONS
SHOULD BE IN REFERENCE TO THE JOB THE ACTUAL WORK ASSIGNMENT FOR WHICH THE PARTICULAR EM
PLOYEE IS BEING PAID. EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ARRIVE AT A JUST ESTIMATE OF THE QUAL
ITIES OF THE PERSON REPORTED ON FOR THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT. AVOID EXAGGERATIONS
AND SUPERLATIVES, THEY DETRACT FROM THE VALUE OF A REPORT AND ARE UNFAIR TO OTHERS

B. BIASED OPINIONS BASED OR PERSONAL LIKES AND DISLIKES MUST BE SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDED. IT
SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE PREPARATION OF EFFICIENCY REPORTS IS AN IMPORTANT FUNC
TION OF ALL SUPERVISORS OF EMPLOYEES, AND THE ACCURATE AND TRUE EVALUATIONS EXPRESSED
THEREIN ARE A DIRECT REFLECTION UPON HIS OWN ABILITY AND QUALIFICATION FOR THE POSITION
HE HOLDS.

C. NO REPORTS WILL BE RENDERED COVERING PERIODS OF LESS THAN 46 DAYS OBSERVED SERVICE.

4. REPORTS WILL NORMALLY BF CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL; HOWEVER, THE CLASSIFICATION MAY BE RAISED IF DEEMED AD
   VISABLE BY RATING OFFICER.

5. REPORTS WILL NEVER BE SHOWE TO THE EMPLOYEE REPORTED ON.

DISPOSITION OF REPORTS

1. REPORTS WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE APPROPRIATE BRANCH CHIEF IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS WITHIN TEN (10)
   DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE REPORTING PERIOD.

2. IF THE REPORTING OFFICER IS THE CHIEF OF STATION, REPORTS WILL BE FORWARDED BY HIM TO THE APPROPRIATE
   BRANCH CHIEF IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS.

3. IF THE REPORTING OFFICER IS NOT THE CHIEF OF STATION, THE REPORT WILL BE REFERRED TO THE NEXT IN COM
   MAND FOR REVIEW AND FINALLY TO THE CHIEF OF STATION FOR FORWARDING TO WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS.

4. UPON RECEIPT OF REPORT IN WASHINGTON HEADQUARTERS, THEY WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE BRANCH CHIEFS PROMPT
   LY AND THEN REFERRED TO THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE FOR PERSONNEL FOR RETENSION IN THE PERSONNEL FILE OF THE EMPLOY
   EE.

A. IF A CHANGE OF PERSONAL STATUS IS REPORTED UNDER SECTION 8. ONE COPY OF SUCH REPORT WILL BE DE
TACHED AND SENT TO THE SECURITY OFFICE

It was therefore necessary to rate him as only good under 9a. This Reporting Officer feels that this is no particular down-grading in this case because time usually heals any difficulties in this regard. Respect for the individual's abilities tends to override the personality weaknesses particularly with his close associates. This Reporting Officer considers this employee as outstanding in our field because, first, his intense interest, second, his innate ability and knack for the work, his training and background, and his great devotion.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. David E. Murphy

SUBJECT : Service in the Clandestine Services
Records Committee

1. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you
   for your service as a member of the CS Records Committee.
   The contributions which you have made to our deliberations
   have been of considerable assistance to me and to the CS
   records program.

2. I believe that effective records and information
   systems are vital to the success of an intelligence organi-
   zation and that the Records Committee plays an extremely
   important role in ensuring that these systems are consonant
   with more pressing and dramatic operational and policy
   requirements. The advice, assistance and participation
   of yourself and other senior officials have enabled us
   to meet our obligations and make steady improvement in
   this area. I hope I may continue to count on your sugges-
   tions, initiative and advice in this area in the future.

Supplement to Staff Employee Personnel

Action for Integration of DAVID E. MURPHY

Effective 20 March 1963

The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth existing policies of concern to you while integrated and to reiterate certain rights and obligations which derive from your true status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:

1. As an employee of this organization, at the present grade and salary of $27,055. per annum, you will accept cover employment with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred to as "your cover facility") effective as of 20 March 1963. You will, insofar as consistent with your basic responsibility to this organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies of your cover facility, in order to appear as a conventional member of that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being effected as a FSR-1 at a salary of $24,244 per annum. You are prohibited, except as specifically authorized herein, from retaining emoluments paid by your cover facility.

2. It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour consists of a period of 2 years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of its expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent with your cover designation, will normally be at the direction of your cover facility. Such travel will be accomplished in conformance with applicable

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

SECRET

regulations of your cover facility except when you are directed for op-
erational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations
of this organization.

4. Salary and allowances paid by your cover facility shall be re-
   tained by you to the extent that they do not exceed the salary and allow-
   ance payment due you on the basis of your grade level when this organiza-
   tion. If such cover payments are less than the amount due you, the dif-
   ference will be paid to you by this organization. If such cover payments
   exceed the amount due you, the excess amounts will be remitted to this
   organization at intervals to be designated by the Office of Finance.
   Computations hereunder will be based on the aggregate gross amounts due
   and received. That portion of retirement contributions withheld by your
   cover facility which exceeds the retirement contributions applicable to
   your organization salary will be deducted from the gross amount of the
   overpayment. Upon integration, the payroll office of this organization
   will establish the date on which you would normally receive a regular step
   increase from your cover facility. Failure to report a grade promotion
   received from a cover facility does cause errors in processing regular step
   increases. Regular step increases, incorrectly processed in such manner,
   should be reported immediately to this organization. To eliminate this
   problem, any grade promotion received from a cover facility will be re-
   ported immediately by you to this organization's payroll office through
   channels showing both the old and the new rate and the effective date.
   All salary difference payments and adjustments will be reflected on earn-
   ings statements.

5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in
   full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility
   and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments
   of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however,
   to preserve the security of your cover position.

a. Upon integrating into your cover facility you will continue
to be covered by the particular retirement system in which you are a par-
ticipant as an employee of this organization. Salary received from your
cover facility and any salary differences payable by this organization will
be subject to appropriate retirement contributions.

b. Appropriate Federal Income tax withholdings shall be made from
taxable income received from both your cover facility and this organization.
Additionally, while serving in the United States, withholdings shall also be
made for District of Columbia or State income tax, when applicable. You may
claim reimbursement for excess income taxes paid on over tax returns by rea-
son of taxable income from your cover facility exceeding the taxable income
due you as an employee of this organization.

c. All annual and sick leave which is accrued to your credit at the time of integration will be transferred to your cover facility. Whtie integrated you will be permitted sormal leave, sick leave, leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organization. Upon termination of your integration, your hused annual leave, sick leave, and home leave will be transferred to your credit with this organization and your leave record will reconstructed as of t beginning of the leave year in which you reborn to this organization, as explained in the Handbook on Leave for Special Situations. Bring In an integrated capacity does not per the curryover from one leave year to another of an annual leave balance which exceeds the ceilinga authorized by regulations of this organization and the Federal leave law. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave, upon your "resignation" you will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization, including any income taxes withheld by your cover facility in order to receive credit for such annual leave.

6. You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all information which you may obtain by reason herece, unless you are releazed in writing by this organization from this obligation. Viclation of suchs secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the espionage lava, an amended, and other applicable laws and regulations. 3.

1.  I would like to take this opportunity, upon the eve of my departure from Berlin, to thank you for the assistance you have given to me.

2.  Your constant cooperation with members of my staff and with the other urdte in this Command has been particularly appreciated. Your advice, which i kara was based on intimate knowledge of the intricate problems pecnifer to Perlin as well as on your thorough professional competence, was most valuable in developing plans and polities for this headquarters. In addition, the valuable and timely information provided by you has contributed to an important degree to the security of this city. I am certain that any successor will continue to benefit greatly from your assistance,

3.  I wish you continued success in your assignment and sincerely hope that someday we will cace again have the pleasure of working together.

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation

TO:
Mr. William Harvey
7971 USARSG
APO 742, US Forces

1. As the Commanding Officer of this unit, it gives me particular
   pleasure to extend my appreciation to Mr. David Murphy and Mr.
   Liebenau for the able and extremely valuable assistance which they
   rendered to an operation of this unit on 24 May 1959.

2. Mr. Murphy, when informed on Sunday 24 May that some
   assistance was needed by this unit, despite the short notice, whole-
   heartedly and unstintingly rendered advice and logistical support.
   Because of unforeseen circumstances, certain support was lacking
   for a particular operation, and Mr. Murphy immediately proferred
   the necessary aid. In discussing the various phases of the operation,
   Mr. Murphy was good enough to share his rich experience with repre-
   sentatives of this unit and thus facilitate implementation of the project.

3. Mr. Liebenau's consideration, tact and concern over the
   security and success of the operation merit praise. Despite the short
   time allocated to Mr. Liebenau's phase in the operation, he consistently
   deferred to the wishes of the members of this unit, recognizing that
   security of the operation was paramount.

4. Such cooperation and spirit of friendliness as exhibited both
   by Mr. Murphy and Mr. Liebenau are a very welcome new page in the
   relationship between this unit and your organization. It is a significant
   step toward the type of coordination and cooperation which will in the
   last analysis benefit the intelligence communty to the detriment of the
   opposition.

TO: Chief, ES

FROM: Chief, Communications Security Division

SUBJECT: Notification of Cryptographic Clearance - David E. Murphy

1. Subject employee has been granted a cryptographic clearance effective this data (or 8 February 1955)

2. Subject has been informed of the granting of clearance and has been briefed concerning cryptographic and related communications security matters.

3. A cryptographic clearance is not a permanent clearance. It will be revoked immediately should the employee fail to maintain the security standards prescribed in CIA Regulation 90-500. It may also be revoked because of lack of need or for appropriate administrative or technical communications security reasons.

4. An individual holding a CIA cryptographic clearance is authorized to have custody, access to, or knowledge of staff cryptographic material or information only to the extent necessary for the performance of his official duties. A cryptographic clearance alone does not constitute authorization to perform cryptographic duties without the prior approval of the Assistant Director for Communications.

5. When Subject employee no longer requires the clearance because of a change in assignment or duties (e.g., return from overseas assignment, replacement or acting communicator) it is requested that the Communications Security Division (2411 H Building, ext. 3021) be notified so that the clearance may be revoked.

## Security Requirements For Government Employment

WHEREAS the interests of the national security require that all persons privileged to be employed in the departments and agencies of the Government, shall be reliable. trust- worthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States; and

WHEREAS the American tradition that all persons should receive fair, impartial, and equitable treatment at the bands of the Govern- ment requires that ai persons seeking the privilege of employment or privileged to be employed in the departments and agencies of the.

SEC. 4. The head of each department and agency shall review, or cause to be reviewed, the cases of all civilian officers and employees with respect to whom there has been conducted a full field investigation under Executive Order No. 9835 of March 21, 1917, and, after such further investigation as may be appropriate, shall readjudicate, or cause to be readjudicated, in accordance with the said act of August 26, 1950, such of those cases as have not been adjudicated under a security standard commensurate with that established under this order.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. HOOVER
DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

This will refer to your memorandum of November 22 with reference to the Marais Childs column appearing in The Washington Post on November 18, 1947 and to your letters of November 21, the one addressed to Mr. Childs and the other addressed to Mr. Paul A. Walker, Acting Chairman, Federal Communications Commission.

It is my view that the Bureau's practice of passing along to the various Government departments and agencies information which comes to its attention in connection with the conduct of investigations normally and regularly within the Bureau's jurisdiction is entirely appropriate and correct. Indeed, it would appear that the Bureau would be remiss in its duty if it failed to pass along information coming to it which might prove to be in the interest of the general welfare. It is not the Bureau's responsibility to determine whether the information is or is not of importance to the particular agency in the carrying out of its current activities and responsibilities and whether or not any action is taken by the department or agency is not, of course, a principal concern of the Bureau.

I believe, therefore, that the Bureau should continue its practice of passing along information which it is believed. might be of interest to the various departments and agencies. At the same time I believe that it would be appropriate either (a) to prepare a circular to the various departments and agencies explaining the Bureau's purpose in furnishing information from time to time, or (b) to make a particular effort for a time when transmitting individual items of information to explain in the transmittal memorandum the Bureau's purpose in. making such transmittal.

Mr. Paul A. Walker
Acting Chairman
Federal Communications Commission
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Walker:

Under date of November 18, 1947, there appeared in the column of Mr. Marquis Childs in the Washington Post the following statement attributed to Mr. Clifford J. Durr of the Federal Communications Commission: "Already the FBI is furmishing to the commission unsolicited reports on individuals connected with radio, and I can assure you that if you should be told the kind of things contained in many of these reports you would dismiss the information as baseless gossip,"

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has referred to the Federal Communications Commission from time to time information which it has received in the course of its regular investigations which appeared pertinent or material to matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission. It is the policy and practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid any attempts to evaluate the significance of information relating to matters without its jurisdiction or the effect of such information upon the contemporary policies and programs of other agencies. As a result, the Bureau furnishes to the various Government departments such information as it receives which appears pertinent to the operations of those Government departments. In so far as is practicable, the Bureau attempts to evaluate the reliability of the source of this information without attempting to make any suggestions as to the use which should or should not be made of the information itself.

Mr. Childs, in his column quoting Mr. Durr's statement, adds the following observation upon Mr. Durr's statement: "Note the word 'unsolicited'. It indicates that the FBI initiated investigations and sought to influence FCC decisions by sending reports on certain individuals to the commission. If this is happening, it is something Congress should know about."

I desire to advise you that this Bureau has not at any time attempted in any manner or degree to influence FCC decisions. The material which has been transmitted to the Commission was sent solely for the purpose of affording the Commission information which came to the Bureau from various sources; which information, it was believed, might be of interest to the official activities of the Commission.

NW 88326 Docld:32989603 Page 11


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

In the light of the statements made by Mr. Durr and since these statements have not been repudiated by any other members of the Federal Communications Commsssion, I must assume that the material which the Bureau has been fuwnishing to the Commission is not desired by the Commission. I am consequently discontinuing the transmittal of such data to the Commission upon the assumption that the material is of no interest to the Commission.

Very truly yours,

# DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

April 7, 1948

TO THE HEADS OF ALL DEPARTMENTS AND
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

In memorandum of October 7, 1947, I called attention to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has primary investigative jurisdiction of Section 3-A (61-1, Title 18, USC) of the Hatch Act. It is also pointed out that under the provisions of a presidential interpretation dated 30 October 1947 the Federal Bureau of Investigation has the responsibility of investigating all charges of disloyalty on the part of federal employees within the executive branch of the Government.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has sufficient investigative personnel under its direct supervision to carry out its responsibility in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Vir-in Islands. However, it does not have personnel stationed in other areas of the world. Therefore, it has been necessary, in order that the Bureau may be enabled to carry out its responsibility, to arrange by agreement with the Departments and Agencies principally concerned for the delegation of the actual investigative work to certain other departments of the Executive Branch in those areas where it has no investigative personnel.

It is recognized that there are two major classes of loyalty investigation. The first is the routine loyalty check of applicants for classified positions or of incumbents of such positions initiated in accord with Executive Order 9835. The second type is that in which doubt of loyalty of incumbents arises independently of the routine check. Procedures in regard to these two types must necessarily vary.

1. Routine loyalty checks of employees stationed overseas.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation will direct specific requests for the assistance of other agencies in handling the actual investigative work in accordance with the following principles:

A. The Department of the Army, Navy, or Air Force shall be requested to utilize its own facilities for the necessary investigation of any of its own civilian personnel stationed outside the continental limits of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation will continue to have the sole responsibility of conducting such investigation as is necessary within the continental limits of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

involving civilian personnel of the Army, Navy or Air Force. The Federal Bureau of Investigation will refer to the appropriate agency all available material and will request investigation, and upon completion thereof, the reports should be furnished to the Federal Bureau of Investigation as provided hereafter.

B. With respect to the necessary investigation of any of the personnel of other Departments and Agencies stationed outside the continental limits of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands--

1. Requests for such investigation of Federal civilian employees stationed in occupied areas or areas under military investigative jurisdiction shall be directed to the Department of the Army, Navy, or Air Force for transmission to the Theater Commander or Area Commanding Officer, who will utilize for this purpose any appropriate investigative facility of the United States available in his area of command.

2. Requests for such investigation of any Federal civilian employees stationed in unoccupied areas shall be directed to the State Department for transmittal to its appropriate foreign office, which will utilize for this purpose any investigative authority of the United States available in that country, or, in case no competent investigative facilities are available in that country, the principal diplomatic officer shall refer the matter for investigation to the principal diplomatic officer stationed in a nearby country where investigative facilities are available.

The reports of completed investigations shall be returned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in response to its original request for assistance through the same channels utilized in transmitting the request for investigation, for consolidation with such material as the Bureau may have available in its files, or may have developed by investigation, and for further processing in line with the procedures which have been developed for carrying out the Loyalty Program.

II. "Complaint Type" loyalty checks of employees stationed overseas.

Such inquiries normally originate in the field and must be handled with the utmost possible dispatch. The agency in which the case originates will notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation as soon as a preliminary inquiry in the field has established grounds for a full investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation will immediately check its files and inform the field agency


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

of any dorogatory information which it may have on file. The Federal Bureau of Investigation will at once open a full field Investigation within the continental limits of the United States, etc., when such investigation is required by the availability of information within those areas. Completion of such investigation will be reported to the originating agency through hormal channels.

A. The Departments of Army, Navy, and Air Force will utilise their own facilities for the necessary investiga tion of any of their own civilian personol stationsd outside the continental limits of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

B. With respect to the necessary investigation under Class II of any of the personnel of other Eepartments and Agencies stationed outside the continental limits of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Fuerto Rico and the Virgin Islandai

1. In occupied areas the Theater Commander will have full responsibility to utilise any appropriate investigative facility of the United States available in his area of command.

2. In unoccupied areas the principal diplomatio officer will be responsible for utilizing any investigative facility of the United States which is available in the country of his jurisdiction, or, if there is no such investigative facility available within the country of his jurisdiction, he shall refer the matter to the principal diplomatio officer stationed in a nearby country in which investigative facilities are available.

The reports of completed investigation shall be forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investination through normal channels.

It is understood that the declaration of emergency, or the establishment of martial law within areas of the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Tuerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands will have the effect fof making those areas "occupied territory," with the consequent application of procedures described in sections IA and BI and IIA above,

The agrcexent which this memorandua serves to record has to do only with the establishing of a method of handling actual investigations in areas where the federal bureau of Investigation has no investigative fa.. cilities. Furthermore, the prodecures heroin crescribed do not rurport to limit in any way, or dolay the excrcise of, the authority possessed by

Honorable Philip Young
Chairman
Civil service Commission
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Mr. Young:

As you know, subsection (d) of section 5 of Executive Order No. 10450 requires that there be returns promptly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigations conducted by all agencies under the order which develop information of the type described in the subsection. The subsection further requires the FBI to make a full field investigation in cases so reported by it. However, except as indicated below, the FBI is not requesting to duplicate investigative efforts contemplated in the limitation on low investigative facilities, an agreement was worked out in coordination with administration of Executive Order No. 10450 with respect to determinations in certain areas. It is suggested that the procedure be continued in connection with investigations to be carried out by the FBI under Executive Order No. 10450. These are as follows:

(1) The FBI will contact all necessary investi-gations in the continental, United States, Alaska, Territory, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

(2) The departments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force will each use its own facilities to conduct investigations in connection with its own civilian personnel outside the areas listed in (1) above.

(3) With respect to the investigation of civilian personnel, other than personnel of departments named in (2), above:

(a) the leading commander or High Commis-sioner will utilize any appropriate investigative

NW 88326 DocId:32989603 Page 17


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

- 2 -

facilition of the United States available to him in an occupied area or in areas under military investigative jurisdiction;

(b) In other areas the Department of State will utilize any investigative authority of the United States available in the country, concerned. If no complete investigative facilities are available in that country, the investigative facilities of the United States in a nearby country will be utilized by the Department of State.

To repeat, the foregoing represents the arrangement between agencies with respect to investigations abroad carried out in the administration of Executive Order No. 9635, and accordingly the procedures utilized will merely involve continuing present procedures. In the absence of any indication of disagreement with the procedures outlined above, this Department will conduct itself on the theory that they remain in effect.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM P. ROGERS

# EXECUTIVE ORDER PROVIDING SECURITY
## REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT

April 14, 1953

Pursuant to your requests, memoranda dated February 4, 1953, February 26, 1953, April 6, 1953, and April 10, 1953, have been submitted to you containing observations regarding proposed drafts of the above Executive Order. Pursuant to the request of Mr. Eduard S. Lazowska of the Department, who delivered a copy of a new draft of this proposed Order on the evening of April 13, 1953, the following observations are set forth for your information and consideration:

In connection with the provision in paragraph 3 (a) which allows the Civil Service Commission, in certain cases, to authorize less than the minimum amount of investigation stated in this paragraph but which meets the requirements of the national security, it is felt the Civil Service Commission must exercise extreme care to insure that any investigation authorized, particularly with respect to individuals who may have access to confidential information, goes, in effect, meet the requirements of the national security.

In connection with Section 4 of the craft, your attention is invited to my previous observation that this Bureau feels it should conduct the additional investigation that may be appropriate only in those cases in which the purpose of the additional investigation is to develop information of a loyalty or subversive nature. In this connection it is observed that the provisions or sections 8 (b) and 8 (d) may be intended to accomplish this purpose. However, it is suggested that you may desire to have the order state more clearly regarding what agencies have the responsibilities to conduct the additional investigation requested in section 4.

In connection with Section 5 of the craft, the thought occurs that its provisions as to what agency is required to conduct "such investigation as may be appropriate" may not be entirely clear. It is believed that the intent of this section is to provide that upon receipt by an agency of information necessitating investigation

NW 88326 Docld:32989603 Page 19


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

by the Civil Service Commission or the employing agency, such informa-
tion should be forwarded to the Civil Service Commission or the employ-
ing agency; that upon the receipt of information necessitating investi-gation by this Bureau, such information should be forwarded to this
Bureau for a full field investigation. You may wish to give considera-tion to possible further clarification of this section.

Regarding the phrase "following such investigation and review
as he deems necessary" set forth in Section 6, it is believed that
"as he deems necessary" refers to the word "review." If, however,
it might also refer to the word "investigation," the thought occurs
that it might be in conflict with other provisions in the draft which
prescribe that in certain instances full field investigations must be
conducted.

In connection with Section 8 (5) it is noted that this section
does not specifically provide for sympathetic association with individu-
members of the organizations referred to in this section. In this con-nection, you will recall that the attachment to my memorandum of April 14
1955, set forth observations of the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference regarding the draft, one of which concerned a suggestion
along this line.

It is observed that Section 14 (a) authorizes the National
Security Council to designate representatives of other Departments and
agencies to furnish advice and to collaborate with the Civil service
Commission in connection with the Commission's study of the manner in
which the Order is implemented. We would appreciate any information
regarding the extent representatives of this Bureau might be expected
to render advice and collaborate with the Civil Service Commission.

It would be appreciated if you could furnish the advice
requested in my memorandum of February 26, 1953, regarding your desires
as to this Bureau following the policy of channeling its investigative
reports through the Civil service Commission to the departments and
agencies concerned.

It is noted that my previous memoranda raised the point as
to what effect the abolishing of the Loyalty Review Board might have
on Executive Order 10422. For your information, funds have been

NW 88326 DocId:32989603 Page 20


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 21

appropriated for the implementation of Executive Order 10422 and this Bureau is proceeding with investigations under this Order and submitting reports to the Civil Service Commission for appropriate adjudication.

Regarding what agencies will have investigative responsibilities abroad under this Order, as mentioned in my previous memoranda, you may wish to give consideration to, if possible, continuing the arrangements which have been perfected under Executive Order 9835.

My memorandum of April 6, 1953, commented regarding paragraph, 8 (b) (4) of the draft received April 2, 1953. t was stated that it was felt investigations regarding individuals who might be subjected to coercion, influence or pressure because of the presence of a close relative in a nation whose interests may be inimical to the interests of the United States which develop a subversive aspect should be done by this Bureau rather than the Civil Service Commission or the employing agency. It is observed that Section 8 (d) of the draft received April 13, 1953, requires this Bureau to conduct all investigations which develop information indicating that an individual may have been subjected to coercion, influence, or pressure to act contrary to the interests of the national security. It is suggested you might desire to clarify this provision further to specifically provide that investigations under this category will be conducted by this Bureau only where there is information indicating a question of loyalty or subversive activity.

As previously mentioned, it will be necessary that the rules and regulations to be issued in connection with the implementation of this order, such as those governing the establishing and operation of hearing boards, be as complete as possible in order to maintain uniformity.

It will, of course, be necessary for this Bureau to receive sufficient funds in order to discharge its responsibilities under this Order.

# EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450
# SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT

In connection with the implementation of Executive Order 10450, the following suggestions, which were previously furnished to you in connection with the drafts of the Order, are being set forth for your consideration for inclusion in the Security Regulations drawn up in connection with this Order:

1. There should be no abuse of the privilege granted to fill sensitive positions in emergency cases prior to the completion of full field pre-appointment investigations.

2. In order that there be no misunderstanding, it might be well to specify in the regulations that the Order covers only the Executive Branch of the Government.

3. It is the understanding of this Bureau that the Civil Service Commission maintains a register of persons eligible for Government employment. In connection with this register, under Executive order 5 these names have been processed in a manner similar to those of employees, and the adjudication made by the Civil Service Commission. Section 11 of the Order states that cases being heard by regional loyalty boards on the effective date of this order in which no specific Department or agency is involves will be dismissed without prejudice to use applicant, this section, unless clarified in the regulations, may affect the Civil Service Commission's Register of eligibles.

Information should be included advising what agencies have investigative responsibility across in connection with this Order. You may desire to continue the arrangements perfected under Executive order 5335 regarding this matter.

There may be some question as to what agencies have investigative responsibilities in connection with the additional investigation that may be necessary in the readjudication of

NW 88326 DocId:32989603 Page 22


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

full field investigations under Executive Order 9835,as
called for in Section 4 of the Order. As you were previously
advised, this Bureau feels it should conduct such investigations,
only when the purpose is to develop information of a nature
described in Section 8(d) of the Order. Unless specific
information to this effect is included in the regulations, it
can be anticipated that this Bureau will receive a large number
of requests for investigations solely for the purpose of bringing
the investigation up to date, or to develop some information of
a nonsubversive nature.

Under Executive Order 9835, this Burecu, through
agreement with the Civil Service Commission, followed the
policy of sending all its reports to the Civil Service
Commission for dissemination to the appropriate departments
and agencies. As you know, the current Order requires thet
the Civil Service Commission maintain a security-investigations
index, which is to include the index maintained by the Civil
Service Commission in conjunction with Executive Order 9885,
This Bureau believes the policy previously followed of sending
these reports to the Civil Service Commission should be
continued.

It will be necessary that a standard form containing
sufficient identifying data be utilized in checking individuols'
names through this Pureau's files and in connection with in
vestigations conducted under this. Order..........

Regarding Section 5 of the Order, this Dureau, on
receipt of information of a nature necessitating investigation
by it, contemplates following the policy of inmediately
initiating the investigation rather than cuaiting a request
for sich an investigation by the deurtnent or agency concerned.
The agency head, however, will be notified that information of
a nature requiring investigation by this Purecu Purecu, has been receive

he will be furnished with the basis for the investigation......
If it is felt that such a policy is in conflict with the pro
visions
sing of the order it would be appreciated if consideration

NW 88326 Docld:32989603 Page 23


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

could be given to clarifying this in the regulations.

Apart from the above suggestions regarding the security regulations, it is noted that the abolition of the Civil Service Commission's regional loyalty boards and the Loyalty Review Board will affect the adjudication procedure required by Executive Order 10422. This is being called to your attention so that the necessary action may be taken to insure that there is no undue delay in connection with the adjudication of cases being investigated under Executive Order 10422.

Your attention is called to Section 9(k) of the Sample Security Regulations dated April 33, 1953. As you will observe, this section concerns the determinations made by hearing boards, and in part states: "One copy of the decision of the board, together with the complete record of the case, including investigative reports, shall be sent to the (head of department or agency) and one copy shall be sent to the employee." This Bureau is strongly opposed to making copies of its reports, in whole or in part, available to individuals investigated under this Order, and considers it absolutely necessary that its reports be maintained in confidence. Of course, this Bureau does not object to the employee's being advised, insofar as security considerations permit, of that information in the reports which is considered necessary in connection with the charges against the employee.

As you will observe, under Section 9(k) the employee could be furnished a copy of the complete record of the case. Such record might include confidential information in the possession of the board which security considerations do not permit making available to the employee. In this connection, it is noted that section 5(n)(3) of the regulations states: "The decision of the hearing board shall be in writing and shall be signed by all members of the board. One copy of the decision shall be sent to the (head of department or agency) and one copy shall be sent to the suspended employee."

In addition, it is noted that the above provisions of Section 9(k) are contradictory to the provisions of section 9(c) of the Order proper, which states that reports and other


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

investigative meterial and information are to be maintained in confidence and no access given thereto, except, with the consent of the investigative agency concerned, to other departments and agencies conducting security programs under the authority of the act of August 26, 1950.

It is strongly urged that you amend the provisions in Section 9(k) of the Sample Security Regulations, because, unless such is done, some departments und agencies may furnish to the employee a copy of the complete record of the case, which would include this Bureau's investigative reports.

Your attention is called to Section 4(b) of the regulations setting forth provisions covering the scope of the investigation to be conducted. The provisions, as set forth, do not include o check of the fingerprint files of this Bureau. As Section 3(a) of the Order, itself, calls for a check of such files, it is suggested you may wish to include this also in the regulations.

# EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT

Reference is made to this Bureau's memoranda dated February 6 and 26, 1953; April 6, 10, and 14, 1953, and May 1, 1953, regarding the captioned Executive Order.

Your immediate advice as to what agencies have the responsibility of conducting investigations abroad under this Order will be appreciated. It can be anticipated that this problem will immediately present itself upon the effective date of the Order. For example, this Bureau may receive a request to conduct a full field investigation regarding an employee who in the past has spent considerable time in foreign countries. Upon the receipt of such a request, it will be necessary to know to what agency a request to conduct the investigation abroad should be directed. As previously suggested, you may wish to continue the arrangements perfected for dealing this problem under Executive Order 9835. For your information, these arrangements are set forth in a memorandum dated April 7, 1948, from the Attorney General to the heads of all departments and independent agencies of the Executive Branch of the Government. The thought occurs that you may desire to issue similar advice to all departments and agencies in connection with Executive Order 10450. (66-6200-121-290 & Part I, Section 2, Serial 87 of the Loyalty Policy File)

Another matter that may cause some difficulty after Executive Order 10450 becomes effective is the question of what agencies have investigative responsibility with respect to the conduct of the further investigation that may be considered appropriate in connection with the re-evaluation of cases of those employees concerning whom a full field investigation was conducted under Executive Order 9835; however, their cases have not heretofore been adjudicated under a security standard commensurate with that established under Executive Order 10450. As previously stated, this Bureau feels it should conduct such investigations only when the purpose is to develop information of a nature described in Section 8 (a) of the Order. It would be appreciated if you would advise whether you are in agreement.

NW 88326 DocId:32989603 Page 26


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

with this. Should you agree with this policy, you may wish to so
advise the heads of all departments and agencies as unless such is
done, this Bureau may receive a large number of requests for
investigations solely for the purpose of bringing the previous
investigations up to date or to develop some allegation of a
nonsubversive nature.

Your attention is invited to my memorandum of May 1, 1953,
wherein I urged that the provisions in Section 9 (k) of the "Sample
Security regulations" be amended to preclude the possibility of any
department or agency furnishing a copy of this Bureau's reports to
the individuals investigated under the Order. It is believed this
should be done prior to the effective date of Executive order 10450,
and I would appreciate being advised of what action is contemplated
in this regard. It is observed that in connection with Executive
Order 9835 the Attorney General under date of December 11, 1947,
directed a confidential memorandum to all department and agency
heads of the Executive Branch of the Government wherein he included
information regarding the use of this Bureau's reports under
Executive Order 9835. The Attorney General's memorandum stated,
"The information appearing in Federal Bureau of Investigation
reports is available for the consideration of the employing agency
in preparing charges against the employee and for appropriate use
by the hearing boards. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is
opposed to making copies of its reports, in whole or in part,
available to individuals as such, and particularly to persons
investigated under the Program." Part III, Section 1, Serial 31 of
Loyalty-Policy file)

It was noted in previous memoranda to you that this Bureau
under Executive Order 9835, through an agreement with the Civil Service
Commission, followed the policy of sending all its reports to the
Civil Service Commission for dissemination to the appropriate
departments and agencies. It was expected that as Executive Order
10450 requires the Civil Service Commission to maintain a security
investigations in re regarding persons investigated under the Order,
the policy of this Bureau sending all its reports to the Civil
Service Commission be continued. Unless advice to the contrary is
received from you, this Bureau contemplates following this policy.

NW 88326 DocId:32989603 Page 27

The "Sample Security Regulations" prepared by the Dopertment contains infomation ro regarding the manner in which hearings are to be conducted by the Eccurity scaring Soares under Executive Creer 10450. Thoso resulations, however, do not state whether these hearings aro to be opened or closed το του public. For your information, the Loyalty Revicu Coard in connection with the matter of nearings held under Executive order 9035, issued a cirective to all departments and spencies advicing teat such hearings should be in private and attendance limited to representatives of the agency who are alrectly connected with the adjudication of the case, representatives of the Loyalty review Lourd, and tue employee or applicant concerned, his counsel or representative, and the witness who is testifying. You may wish to issue appropriato advice to all departments ana agencies reguraing who swall.bo permitted to be present during hearings held under Lxecutive cruer 1050.

It is also noted that the "Sample Security Regulations" state that the employee shall be permitted to cross-examine any witness offered in support of the merges against aia.

This Bureau will continue the above policy under Executive Order 10450; however, should you determine that Security Hearing Boards may hear witnesses only in the presence of the employeo and his counsel, it will be appreciated if you will immediately advise this Bureau so that all individuals interviewed who may later be requested to testify before a Security Wearing Board will clearly understand that such testimony must be in the presence of the employee and his counsel and they may be cross-examined by the employee or his counsel.

It can be anticipated that, in connection with some hearings held under xecutive Order 10450, the hearing board may request agents of this Pureau to appear and testify. In this connection, this Duronu would acciate it if the policy followed in this respoet under sent-- Order 9535 could be continued. This policy was set forth in a confidontics mmorandum from the Attorney General dated December 11, 1947, to all department and arency heads of the Executive Brench of the Government, which stated that Special Aconts of this Curcan will testify before hearing boards where they are in a position to furnish cometent evidance.

In this commotion, the question mer arise as to whether the Ceneral Accounting Office, the Goverment Printing Office, and the Library of Congress might be per- mitted to participate in the procedures offected under Executive Order 10450. You may recell that they have verticipated in the proceduros of Exccutive Ordor 9035. You may chorofore desire to ascertain from the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress whether they wish to particinate in the procedures prescribed by Executive Order 10150, and if they do desire to participato, determine whether the provisions of Executive Order 1050 authorize such particination.

# Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Mr. J. Edgar Hoover
Director, FBI

FROM: William P. Rogers
Deputy Attorney General

DATE: June 25, 1953

SUBJECT: Executive Order 10450
Security Requirements for Government Employment.

This is with reference to your memoranda of May I and May 14, 1953, relating to the administration of Executive Order 10450.

1. Your opinion that there should be no abuse of the privilege granted by section 3(b) of the order in filling sensitive positions in emergency cases prior to the completion of full field pre-appointment investigations is well taken. So, also, is your suggestion that the Civil Service Commission, in respect to section 3(a), should utilizė extreme care in permitting less than the minimum investigation with respect to per diem, intermittent, temporary, or seasonable employees and aliens employed outside the United States.

2. I agree with your assumption that the coverage of the order is limited to the Executive Branch of the Government. However, I do not believe it will be necessary to make specific provision in the regulations to that effect. Inasmuch as they are to be issued separately by and in the name of each executive branch, department or agency, it will be made clear that they relate only to the administration of the particular department or agency concerned.

You also make reference to the fact that certain of the non-executive branch agencies, such as the General Accounting Office and the Government Printing Office, participated in the procedures prescribed by Executive Order 9835. I understand this resulted, not because that order was necessarily applicable to those agencies, but because they voluntarily adopted procedures similar to those prescribed by the order. Executive Order 10450 does not prevent them from adopting a similar policy in relation to it. The main question is whether the appropriations of the FBI are sufficient to pay for the investigations required by such agencies. I understand that the appropriations are sufficient with respect to some of the agencies whose employees are part of the classified civil service, such as the General Accounting Office, but not for others, such as the Library of Congress. In the past a system of reimbursement was worked out with respect to investigations for agencies not covered by existing appropriations. I would suggest that the Bureau


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

work out similar procedures with the Civil Service Commission and other interested agencies with respect to Executive Order 10450.

3. In reference to the problem of the responsibility of conducting investigations abroad, the Departments of State and Army were requested by letter dated June 5, 1953, to continue the same arrangement under Executive Order No. 10450 for investigations abroad as existed under Executive Order No. 9835. The letter stated that in the absence of any indication of disagreement with this plan, it would be assumed that the existing arrangement would remain in effect. To date no expressions of disagreement have come from either Department.

4. In respect to the re-adjudication question arising under section 4, I agree that the Bureau should conduct additional investigations only when their purpose is to develop information of the type described in section 8(d). However, I believe the Civil Service Commission, rather than this Department, should issue direct instructions to all departments and agencies as to proper procedures in connection with requests for investigation. I would accordingly recommend that you work out a plan with the Civil Service Commission to so advise the interested departments and agencies.

5. As you point out, the last sentence of section 9(k) of the sample security regulations is subject to possible interpre- tation requiring the employee to be given a copy of the investigative reports in connection with his case. In order to preclude this possibility, an appropriate amendment has been transmitted to all departments and agencies. Many of them have also been informally advised of the matter. In addition, since they are supposed to submit their regulations to this Department before issuance, proper precautions will be taken at that time.

6. I agree that your existing policy of sending all Bureau reports to the Commission for dissemination to the appropriate depart- ments and agencies should be continued.

7. You note that the sample security regulations do not state whether the hearings are to be open or closed and that under Executive Order 9835 the Loyalty Review Board issued a directive to all departments and agencies requiring hearings under that order to be private. In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to that effect. has been transmitted to all executive departments and agencies.

8. You point out that the sample security regulations provide in section 9(c) (4) that each employee shall have the right "to cross-examine any witness offered in support of the charges"; whereas under Executive Order 9835 the Loyalty Review Board issued.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

a directive permitting Loyalty Hearing Boards to hear witnesses in the absence of the employee and his counsel, if the witness so requested.

I understand the provision of section 9(6)(4) to be a deliberate policy judgment that witnesses, other than confidential informants, shall be subject to cross-examination. Accordingly, persons giving testimony will not have the choices set forth in your memorandum. I therefore suggest that you advise prospective witnesses that their testimony will have to be in the presence of the employee and his counsel and will be subject to cross-examination.

9. I consider the Bureau's policy of permitting Special Agents to testify at the hearings only "where they are in a position to furnish competent evidence," to be sound and suggest that you undertake through the Civil Service Commission to advise the agencies concerned that this policy will be continued.

10. Serious consideration has been given to your suggestion that dismissals without prejudice to applicants in cases before the Regional Loyalty Boards may effect the Civil Service Commission's register of eligibles. The Commission has already advised that it believes that, under the basic Civil Service Act, it can establish criteria with respect to the register of eligibles similar to those set out in the order. The Department has advised the Commission that the order does not preclude it from so acting under the authority of the Civil Service Act if it is satsified as to the existence of such authority.

11. I also go along with your view that it will be necessary that agencies use, a standard form containing sufficient identifying data in checking individuals! names through the Bureau's files and in connection with investigations conducted under the Executive Crder, and suggest that you work out a procedure for establishing such a form with the Civil Service Commission.

12. With relation to section 5 of the order you state that the Bureau, on receipt of information of a nature necessitating investigation by it, intends to follow the policy of immediately initiating the investigation rather than awaiting a request from the department or agency concerned, but notifying the head of the department or agency that information of a nature requiring investigation by the Dureau has been received and an investigation is being conducted. You also mention that upon request the interested.agency will be furnished with the basis for the investigation. I do not believe this policy to be in conflict with any provision of the order and see no reason why you should not follow the policy you suggest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

13. You point out that section 3(a) of the order requires
    "a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
    gation", but that section 4(b) of the sample security regulations
    dealing with the same subject matter omits the quoted language.
    In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to the regula-
    tions along the lines you suggest has been transmitted to all executive
    departments and agencies.

14. You note that the abolition of Regional Loyalty
    Boards and the Loyalty Review Board will affect procedures pursuant
    to Executive Order 10422 relating to United States citizens who
    are United Nations employees. As you suggested, amendments to
    cover this situation have been promulgated to all executive depart-
    ments and agencies.

Subject: EXECUTIVE ORTER 10450
SECURITY RECUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT

With the inception of the cantioned Executive Order it became evident to this Bureau that certain problems would arise which have been encountered in the past in this Cureau's operations under the provisions of "recutive Order 98335. Several of these have been posed to the Department of Justice and the latter has now furnished tris ureau its advice regarding them.

One consideration is just what agencies in the Federal Government are to be included in the operations of Trecutive Order 10350. As your files will reflects by letter dated August 21, 1947, the Honorable arthur. Flerining, then the Acting President of the Commission, furnished this Jureou a list of cil such agencice to be included within the provisions of Ezecutive Order 99956 ambered aroon these were the General Accounting Office and the Government printing Office, neither neithe of which were agencies of the recutive Pranch. The thought occurred ce to whether these agencies are to be included Hader the noo program and is as hether your cotinetes of cases to be handled for these evencies in the current and succeeding fiscal years which you have furnished this Aureau include the ceneral Accountin Office and the Government Printing Office.

It is understood that the Commission considers playeខន of these agencies within the provisions of rzecutive Or since they are competitive employees as are the bulk on

NW 88326 Docld:32989603 Page 36


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

employees of several executive agencies. It would be appreciated if you would furnish this Bureau a list of the agencies to be included within the provisions of Frecutive Order 10450 at your earliest convenience. In addition, would you advise whether the General Accounting Office and the Government Printing Office and their employees will be considered as subject to the provisions of the captioned order. If such is the case we would appreciate your advice as to whether your estimate of the volume of work to be handled for these agencies was included in the budgetary estimates furnished this Bureau.

As you are aware, employees of the Library of Congress have been processed under Executive Order 9835 through agreement with officials of the Library and the results of name checks and investigations handled for the Library were compensated for on a reimbursable basis. Would you advise whether the agreement had with the Library of Congress for processing its employees under the old Loyalty Order has been renewed for Executive Order 10450. If such is the case is the Library of Congress agreeable to continue the procedure of reimbursement for each matter handled?

With regard to the question as to what agencies have investigative responsibilities in connection with the additional investigation that may be necessary in the readjudication of full field investigations conducted under Executive Order 9335 as called for in Sed Section 4 of the cuptioned order, this Bureau feels it should conduct such investigations only when the purpose is to develop information of a nature described in "ection 8(d) of this order. The Department of Justice advised that it concurs in this opinion and stated that it feels the Civil Service Commission should isque direct instructions to all departments and agencies as to the proper procedures to be followed in connection with requests for further investigation. It is felt that if such instructions are issued it will preclude the receipt of a large number of requests by the FBI for investigation solely to bring the previous investigation up to date or to develop some allecations of a nonsubversive nature. For your further information, the Department of Justice has advised that it agrees this Bureau should continue the procedure established under the Loyalty Order of channeling its investigative reports through the Civil Service Commission for dissemination to the appropriate departments or agencies.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

Your attention is invited to the letter from Mr. Peter Campbell Brown, then the Acting Assistant to the Attorney General, to the Honorable Seth W. Richardson, then the Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board, dated Day 5, 1949, Therein Hr. Brown requested Hr. Richardson to clarify Review Board instructions to the various departments and agencies to the effect that "Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation will testify before Hearing Boards where they are in a position to furnish competent evidence. They will not, however, participate otherwise in the proceedings or will they be made available merely to interpret information appearing in their investigative reports." This policy will continue to be the policy of this Bureau under Executive Order 10450 and it has been concurred in by the Department of Justice, The Department has further suggested that the Commission so advise the various departments and agencies that this policy will be continued.

These points are being called to your attention in order that you may furnish this Bureau the information requested above, as well.as give consideration to the necessity for furnishing instructions as outlined above to the varicus agencies for their information and guidance in the operations of Executive Order 10450.

"CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION"
IN YOUR REPLY REFER TO
FILE
AND DATE OF THIS LETTER

July 21, 1955

Honorable J. Edgar Hoover.
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

You will recall that several agencies of the Legislative Branch of the Government participated in the loyalty program prescribed in Executive Order 9835. These same agencies have made requests of the Cormission that they be permitted to participate in a similar manner under the program prescribed in Executive Order 10450. By letter dated June 29, 1953, the Deputy Attorney General advised the Comission that if these agencies are of the view that they can adopt procedures which would make it possible for them to participate in the program by virtue of authority conferred under the acts under which they operate, it would be entirely appropriate for them to participate in the program on a voluntary basis. It was suggested in this letter that the Commission work out with your Bureau the question relating to reimbursement by the agencies involved.

Because of the above opinion I have attached for your consideration proposed undated drafts of letters to the Librarian of Congress, The Public Printer, and the Director of Personnel of the General Accounting Office advising that sübject to their meeting the above conditions they may participate in this program. The budget estimates of the Commission for some time have inclučed work items which would result from making national agency checks and inquiries and limited personal investigations, when necessary, for the Government Printing Office and the General Accounting Office. It is our understanding that this is true with respect tο the budget estimates of your Bureau insofar as they pertain to searching fingerprint records and Standard Forms 67 for employees of these agencies and making full field investigations when necessary under Section 8(d) of Executive Order 10450. For this reason, no feature of reimbursement has been mentioned in our proposed letters to these agencies.

The Commission is willing to conduct for the Library of Congress cn a reimbursable basis activities which it would perform for an agency ia the Executive Branch under Executive O Order 10450. I have taken the liberty of including in the draft to the Librarian of Congress the basis for re- imbursing your Bureau for its part in this program. This was done for.

# UNITED STATES CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20415

December 2, 1965

Honorable Nicholas deB. Katzenbach
Attorney General
Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

The President has directed the Civil Service Commission, after consulting with the major users of personnel investigations, to formulate and issue minimum standards of acceptable investigative coverage for Federal civilian employment.

I should appreciate your comments and suggestions relative to the following proposed minimum standards for acceptable full field coverage:

## Scope of Full Field Investigations

Full field investigations on Federal employees and applicants are personally conducted investigations which cover the life of the individual with special emphasis on the person's background and activities during the most recent fifteen years, or since his eighteenth birthday, whichever is the shorter period. In addition, a thorough personal investigation is made of any materially derogatory matters developed, requiring investigation before the fifteen-year period.

The basic elements of investigation are:

*   a national agency check, as described on page 736-3 of the Federal Personnel Manual.

*   personal interviews with present and former employers, supervisors, fellow workers, references, neighbors, school authorities; and other associates.

*   checks of police, credit, field office and other pertinent records as appropriate, such as Immigration and Naturalization, Passport Division of the State Department - 1935, vital statistics, military service, and the like.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 45

Personal interviews are scheduled with employers, supervisors, and work associates to verify and obtain pertinent details for all employments in the investigativo period. Particular caro is taken also to verify the fact of unemployment or self-cmployment claimed by the subject of investigation.

The last period of education at a college level is always verified by a check of the school records. Stacndary cducation is investigated whon tho subject is young and has had no subsequent schooling. Porcoral interviews are conducted with witnesses such as professors and former students who werè associated with the subject during recent schooling.

Neighborhood investigation is regularly conducted to cover residenco during the most recent three years. Testimony of neighbors before that period ray be sought to verify periods of unemployment or self-employment, or to resolve questionable matters which have been raised from other sourcos.

The number of witnesses interviewed cannot be reduced to a formula but in each caso depends upon the diversity of the subject's experience and places of residence, as well as upon the depth of knowledge showm by witnesses concerning the subject's character, habits, and background. The objective of the investigation is to obtain a comprehensive and well-rounded picture of the individual's background and activities.

## Matters Covered

### Field Investigations

Basically, full field investigations are designed to develop sufficient information to enable agency accutricials to determine the fitness of persons entering critical- v positions. Fitness includes both security and suitability el...........

Character, habits, morals, on are investigated generally. Loyalty is particularly stressed and if a question is raised concerning. the subject's loyalty the case is referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with Section 8 (d) of Executivo Order. 10450. Particular attention is directed to cuch miters as immorality, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, lack of integrity, dismissals from employ- mont, arrests, financial responsibility, and health.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

The affirmativo qualities and qualifications of the subject are fully roported.

Over and above the minimum standards, the full field investigation may be tailored to obtain infomation in depth concerning special attributes and qualifications required for propor performance in the particular kind of position involved.

To facilitate early completion of this study, I should like to receive your comments by December 31, 1965. Mr. Kimbell Johnson, Director, Bureau of Personnel Investigations, is available to discuss any aspect of the proposed standards with members of your staff. He may be reached on Code 183, Extension 7205.

Sincerely yours,

## SCOPE OF FULL FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

December 15, 1965

Reference is made to your letter of December 9, 1965, forwarding a copy of Chairman Macy's letter of December 2, 1965, concerning minimum standards for acceptable full field coverage.

As you are aware, this Bureau conducts our own personnel investigations. The scope of these and other full field investigations conducted by this Bureau under various programs, such as the Federal Employee Security Program and the United Nations Loyalty Program, exceeds the minimum standards set forth in Chairman Macy's letter. The letter of December 2, 1965, does not change the investigative responsibilities of this Bureau.

In view of the above, this Bureau has no comments to make concerning the proposed minimum standards of acceptable investigative coverage for Federal civilian employment. This Bureau took a similar position in connection with this matter in a letter to Mr. Kimball Johnson dated April 23, 1950.

EXECUTIVE ORDERS 9835, 10450, AND 11605

Executive Order 9335, Part III, paregraph 3, provided that the Attorney General "after appropriate investigation and determination" would furnish to the Loyalty Heview Board the name of each foreign or domestic organization which the Attorney General had designated "as totalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive, or as having adopted a policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution of the United States, or as seeking to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means."

Executive Order 10450, Section 12, revoked Exccutive Order 9835, as anwended; however, it provided that the Departo:ent of Justice "shall continue to furnish the information described in paragraph 3 of Part III" of Executive Order 3835, "but directly to the head of each department or agency."

Executive Order 11605, paragraph 2, amended Ecction 12 of Executive Order 10450 by, among other provisions, providing that "the head of each department and agency shall bo furnished by the Attorney General with the more of each organization which shall be or has been heretofore destinted under this order r" and that nothing.. herein shall... affect previous designations made pursuant to Exocutive Order 10460, as amended." (Subparagraph (b)) Executive Order 11605 further provided that "the Subversive Activities Control Eoard shall, upon potition of the Attorney General, conduct appropriate hearings to determine whether any organization is totalitarian, fascist, communist, subversive, or whether it has adopted a policy of unlawfully advocating the commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution or lawg of the United States or of any tote, on which seeks to overthrow the government of the United Staten or any State or subdivision thereof by unlawful means," (Subparagraph (c))

The Attorney Gene al

To date, Congress has refused to appropriate funds for the operation of the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB).

During a current study of FEI jurisdiction by this Bureau, the questions have arisen: has the authority to designate organizations been taken from the Attorney General and given to the SACB by Executive Order 11605, or is this authority concurrent; and at this time, what are the responsibilities and authority of the FEI under Executive Order 10450, as amended, and Executive Order 11605?

Would you please provide me with a statement of the Department's current position on these questions.

DATE: April 3, 19:3

SUBJECT: Executive Orders 9835, 10450, and 11605

This is in reference to your memorandum dated March 20, 1973 in which you requested to be advised regarding the Department's position relating to the above executive orders.

In the event the Subversive Activities Control Board ceases to function after July 1, 1973, the designation program as authorized by E. 0. 10450, as amended, will continue to remain in effect. The Board's demise will, however, eliminate it as the body which at this time has the exclusive authority to conduct, upon petition of the Attorney General, the evidentiary hearings and make the determinations as to whether an organization should be designated within the criteria and standards specified by E. O. 10450, as amended by E. Ο. 11605.

The question of revising E. O. 10450 to overcome any deficiency which arises as a result of the demise of the Board is currently under study in the Department. There is also legislation pending to afford Congressional approval to E. 0. 11605. Until such time as these matters are resolved, it is requested that the Bureau continue to conduct the investigations which it has carried out under E. Ο. 10450 which is, of course, still in effect.

## EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450

Executive Order (EO) 10450 is currently being amended by the Department and representatives of this Bureau have participated in a task force headed by Mr. Oran Waterman, Director, Department Security Staff, which is recommending certain changes be made in EQ 10450.

During the course of discussions within the task force, it was pointed out to Mr. Waterman the Bureau's authority to conduct investigations in the domestic subversion field has come under considerable scrutiny. The. Bureau is now conducting investigations of domestic cubversion on the basis of existing Federal statutes. This investigative policy may not adequately meet the needs of an effective security of Covernment employees program under EO 10450..

The Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, previously solicited our views on abolition of the Attorney (encral's List.. In our response captioned "Abolition of the Attorney General's Dist," dated April 11, 1974, cur comments included advice that under our current statutory basis for domestic subversion investigations may not adequately meet the needs of LO 10450 and the observation the FBI has never received speciile instructions from the Attorney General to conduct intelligence-type investigations to identify and determine the activities of organizations described in Section 8 (a) (5) of EC 10150. We also requested to be advised as to the instructions of the Attorney Ceneral relating to the FBI conducting intelligence-type investigations uncer EOI0450, as well as the scope and parameters within which such Investigations should be conducted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Criminal Division

Our current practice of conducting subversive-type Investigations based on Federal statutes may tend to restrict our intelligence gathering concerning organizations, associations, movements, groups and combinations of persons as defined in Section 8 (a) (5) of EO 10450. In responding to our above-referred-to memorandum of April 11, 1974, it is recommended the Attorney General consider issuance of some form of Departmental instructions or order establishing firm guidelines for intelligence-type investigations which would define our authority in this regard. It is believed this would put the FBI on a firm foundation to conduct intelligence-type investigations involving groups defined in Section 8 (a) (5) to adequately support EO 10450. We have previously recommended that the Department seek a comprehensive Executive Order, and furnished suggested language, which would provide a firm basis for FBI intelligence-type investigations in the security field. This recommendation is still under study by the Department.

We would be glad to meet with representatives of the Department to discuss this matter in more detail.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEE SECURITY PROGRAM
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450

August 19, 1974

Since the issuance of Executive Order 11785 on June 4, 1974, abolishing the Attorney General's list of designated organizations, one of the standards used by the FBI in initiating investigations of individuals pursuant to Executive Order 10450 has been eliminated. This is true with regard to investigations under captioned matter of individuals which may be initiated by the FBI based on information contained in our files as well as in evaluating requests for investigations of individuals received from other agencies and departments pursuant to Section 8(d) of Executive Order 10450.

In this connection it is noted that the Criminal Division of the Department in its letter of July 11, 1974, advised that continued investigation by the FBI of the Nation of Islam is warranted because, among other things, "its reported activities appear to come within the criteria of Executive Order 10450."

In view of the issuance of Executive Order 11785, it will be appreciated if you will furnish guidelines to be used by the FBI in initiating investigations of individuals under captioned matter pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically criteria to be utilized in determining whether available information is sufficient basis for an investigation.

August 14, 1974

This will confirm the request on August 6, 1974, of Mr. Oran H. Waterman, Director, Department Security Staff, advising he was acting on a request from your office, that copies of reports containing the results of investigations of individuals conducted under captioned matter pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order 10450 bo furnished, where pertinent, to his office directly rather than through your office. This procedure was instituted on August 6, 1974. After review by the Dopartment Security Staff it is understood that the reports are forwarded to the Crininal Division.

As in the past, these reports are furnished to the Department in order that consideration may be given as to whether any Federal laws have been violated and for information concerning possibic subversive infiltration into, the Executivo Branch of the Government.

With regard to a determination as to whether any Federal laws have been violated, it is noted the violations generally involve Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1001, and a response is received from the Criminal Division.

Information concerning subversive infiltration into the Executive Branch of the Government is furnished for the Department's assistance in discharging its responsibilities under Section 13 of Executive Order 10450 which reads: "The Attorney General is requested to render to the heads of departments and agencies such advice as may be requisite to enable them to establish and maintain an appropriate employee security program."

This is in response to your memoranda, entitled as above, dated May 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy Attorney General, Criminal Division, and referring to problems which have arisen as a result of the promulgation of Executive Order 11785 which amends Executive Order 10450. In view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I will undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the Criminal Division.

As you know this matter has been under continuing review both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this office, of working level representatives of various agencies in the security field and is now under study to a lesser degree in Project #10 of the "Domestic Council on Privacy".

You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instructions to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations to identify and determine the activities of organizations now described in the amended Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order 10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in initiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to be utilized in determining whether available information is a sufficient basis for investigation.

Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order 10450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those which unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their rights under the constitution or laws of the United States or


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

any State, (2) or which seek to overthrow the Government of the United States, or any State or subdivision thereof, by unlawful means. (Emphasis added).

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate that the investigation should be initially based on a possible violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful act of force or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to detect organizations with a potential of the above nature, it is important that the investigation proceed on the basis of information indicating that the organization may be of the nature mentioned. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the investigation is initiated, but only that a reasonable evaluation of the available information suggests that the activities of the organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The most recent example of the type of organization, that you have advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Organizations of this nature would clearly fall within the Order and should be investigated as soon as information is available indicating their potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the investigations of such organizations if their programs call for acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the commission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these programs.

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investigation suggests a determination that the organization is engaged in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should continue.

It follows in answer to your second question that individuals' who are active either as members of or as affiliates of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

organizations described above should be investigated when information is received indicating their involvement. The same yardstick indicated above for organizations in determining whether the investigation should continue, should apply concerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably be made that the individuals activities, either within the organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in violation of any law, then the investigation should cease.

FEDERAL EMPLOYEE SECURITY PROGRAM
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450

Reference is made to your memorandum dated
November 1, 1974, in answer to our previous inquiries
requesting advice concerning the effect of Executive
Order (50) 11735 on our investigations of organizations
and individuals engaged in subversive activities.

While refcrenced memorandum advises we should
use the same yardstick for investigation of subversive
organizations and subversive individuals, the comments
following that advice, concerning individuals, are
believed subject to intergrotation as being more
restrictive in scone. Specifically, concerning organ-
izations, you essentially advised that when investigation
dotermines the activitics are loral in nature, than
the investigation should cesso, out if the activities
are illegal or potentially illemal, the investigation
should continue. Concerning individuals, the
memorandum advises essentially that the same yardstick
be used but adds when the activities do not appear to
be in violation of any law, then the investigation should
cease.

Further, the tenor of your memorandum,
particularly comments contained in page two, paragraph
one, follow the concept of investigative scope consistent
with the advice as to investication of subversive
organizations but does appear to conflict with the
latter comments concerning investigation of individuals
where the phrase "not in violation of any law" is used.
We would appreciate clarification concerning this matter.

Assistant Attorney General
for Administration

Your memorandum of November 1, 1974, in part,
responded to this Bureau's memorandum of August 19, 1974,
which asked for guidelines to be used by the FBI in
initiating investigations of applicants and employees in
the Executive Branch of the Government pursuant to Section
8(d) of EO 10450. This Section specifically instructs
other agencies to promptly refer to the FBI for investi-
gation those cases which develop information indicating
that an individual may have been subjected to coercion,
influence or pressure to act contrary to the interests of
the national security, or information relating to any of
the other matters described therein.

Since the guidelines furnished by you are
concerned primarily with possible violation of law, a
decision to be made by the Department, it will be
appreciated if you will furnish additional guidelines
to cover "sympathetic association" and other standards
mentioned in Section 8(a) (2) through (8) when the
investigation concerns an applicant or employee in the
Executive Branch of the Government.

In considering the foregoing, it should be noted
the FBI has another responsibility under EO 10450 which is
'set forth in Section 5. This Section provides that
whenever there is developed or received by any department
or agency information indicating that the retention in
employment of any officer or employee of the Government
may not be clearly consistent with the interests of the
national security, such information shall be forwarded to
the head of the employing department or agency or his
representative.

Your attention is also invited to Chapter 736. of
the Federal Personnel Manual, which instructs agencies to
promptly refer to the FBI for investigation cases 'which
develop information indicating that a person may have been
subject to coercion, influence or pressure to act contrary
to the interests of the national security, or information on
possible disloyalty to the United States."

# Assistant Attorney General for Administration

Chapter 732 of the Federal Personnel Manual instructs that before an agency issues a letter of charges under 10 10450, the Department of Justice shall be consulted to assure that the rights of the employees are fully considered. Section 13 of 10 10450 requests the Attorney General to render to the heads of departments and agencies such advice as may be requisite to enable them to establish and maintain an appropriate employee security program.

Available information indicates that difficulties of proof imposed by the courts in loyalty and security cases have proved almost insurmountable and as a resuit no removals or other adverse actions have been taken on these grounds for several years and the adjudicative basis has apparently shifted from loyalty and security to suitability.

An early response in this matter will be appreciated.

NOTE:

We have corresponded with the Department concerning amendments to EO 10450 by EO 11785 and requested guidelines as to our investigations of subversive matters defined in EO 10450 as amended by EO 11785 as none have been previously furnished by the Department. This is necessary because the Federal Employee Security Program depends on subversive information originating with our subversive investigations. The foregoing requests clarification in conflicting language in the Department 's response as to subversive investigations and response to questions concerning the FBI's investigative role in the above Program.

Although our original inquiry was directed to Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the Department memorandum notes Assistant Attorney General, Administrative Division, answered with concurrence of the Criminal Division. We are, therefore, directing our request for clarification to Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 2/6/01 BY SPALMIRP

Reference is made to SSC letter dated February 9, 1976, requesting appropriate FBI materials describing the policy and procedures of the Bureau for investigations carried out pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 10450, (enclosed), as amended, including, but not limited to, the standards for checking the names for Federal employees or prospective employees in FBI files (a National Agency Check) the standards for determining whether or not there is "derogatory information" in the FBI files, the policies for dissemination of such infor- mation, and the circumstances under which the FBI will conduct its own investigation of a prospective Federal employee. Set forth below is this Bureau's response to the requests mentioned in referenced letter. Also enclosed are materials responsive to the requests mentioned in referenced letter.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE FBI FOR
INVESTIGATIONS PURSUANT TO EO 10450, AS AMENDED

Executive Order (EO) 10450, as amended, came into existence on April 27, 1953, and serves as the basic authority under which most personnel investigations are conducted at the present time involving applicants and employees in the Executive Branch.

EO 10450, in its preamble, states that the interests of the national security require all persons privileged to be employed by the Government shall be reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States.

Section 2 requires the agency head to maintain an effective program to insure that the employment or retention of applicants and employees is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC).

Section 8 lists the conditions for developing information which is of investigative and, by inference, adjudicative interest.

Section 13 states: "The Attorney General is requested to render to the heads of departments and agencies such advice as may be requisite to enable them to establish and maintain an appropriate employee security program."

Chapter 732 of the Federal Personnel Manual instructs that before an agency issues a letter of charges under EO 10450, the Department of Justice shall be consulted to assure that the rights of the employees are fully considered.

The Government Printing Office, General Accounting Office, and Library of Congress, all in the Legislative Branch, voluntarily participated in the loyalty program prescribed by EO 9835. The same agencies desired to participate in the program set up by EO 10450. These agencies again, with the approval of the Department of Justice, worked out with the Department and with the Civil Service Commission procedures for their participation in EO 10450. The results of FBI investigations under EO 10450 concerning applicants and employees of these agencies in the Legislative Branch are furnished to the Civil Service Commission, which in turn furnishes the results to the designated officials in the specific agency.

Available information indicates that difficulties of proof imposed by the courts in loyalty and security cases are considered almost insurmountable and as a result no removal or other adverse actions have been taken on these grounds for several years and the adjudicative basis has shifted from loyalty and security to suitability. Thus, favorable determinations are said to be based on EO 10450 while unfavorable decisions almost always rely on the suitability provisions of Civil Service Regulations.

It is noted that you have previously reviewed Section 19, "Applicant and Employee Investigations Conducted for Other Government Agencies," FBI Manual of Instructions,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 64

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Volume II, which contains instructions to be followed for investigations carried out pursuant to EO 10450, as amended. This should be referred to for an understanding of the FBI's policy and procedures.

Section 8(d) reads as follows:

There shall be referred promptly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation all investigations being conducted by any other agencies which develop information indicating that an individual may have been subjected to coercion, influence, or pressure to act contrary to the interests of the national security, or information relating to any of the matters described in subdivisions (2) through (8) of subsection (a) of this section. In cases so referred to it, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall make a full field investigation.

Chapter 736 of the Federal Personnel Manual instructs agencies to promptly refer to the FBI for investigation cases "which develop information indicating that a person may have been subject to coercion, influence, or pressure to act contrary to the interests of the national security, or information on possible disloyalty to the United States." This Chapter also requires that "information as to subversive activity on the part of employees in the Executive Branch....is referred by the employing agency.... to the Federal Bureau of Investigation" so that necessary investigation is conducted by the FBI.

In a memorandum dated August 19, 1974, (enclosed), to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, with a copy for the Director, Department Security Staff, Department of Justice, reference was made to EO 11785 dated June 4, 1974, (enclosed), which abolished the Attorney General's list of designated organizations, one of the standards used by the FBI in initiating investigations of individuals pursuant to EO 10450. It was pointed out this standard was eliminated with regard to investigations of applicants and employees in the Executive Branch which may be initiated by the FBI based on information in our files


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 65

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

as well as in evaluating requests for investigations of individuals received from other agencies and departments pursuant to Section 8(d) of EO 10450. Guidelines were requested for the use of the FBI in initiating investigations of individuals pursuant to EO 10450 and specifically criteria to be utilized in determining whether available information is sufficient basis for investigation under EO 10450.

A response to these inquiries was made by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration on November 1, 1974, (enclosed), advising that the FBI should continue to conduct investigations to identify organizations coming within the purview of Section 8(a) (5) of EO 10450, i.e., organizations which: (1) unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State; or (2) which seek to overthrow the Government of the United States or any State or subdivision thereof by unlawful means. The Department advised that if the investigation of an organization "suggests a determination that the organization is engaged in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities, it should continue."

Regarding the investigation of individuals, the Department advised that members or affiliates of organizations described above should be investigated and the same yardstick should be utilized as was indicated for organizations in determining whether the investigation should continue. The Department added, however, that "when a determination can reasonably be made that the individual's activities, either within the organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in violation of any law, then the investigation should cease."

In a memorandum dated December 11, 1974, (enclosed), to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration, clarification was requested of the guidelines for investigations by the FBI of applicants and employees in the Executive Branch under EO 10450 since the Department's statement that the same yardstick should be utilized in the case of organizations and individuals appears to be at variance with that used concerning organizations.

## STANDARDS FOR CHECKING FBI FILES
## FOR A NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK

Section 3(a) provides that the appointment of each civilian employee shall be made subject to investigation but in no event shall the investigation include less than a national agency check including a check of the fingerprint files of the FBI.

Although the scope of a national agency check is not defined in EO 10450, Chapter 736 of the Federal Personnel Manual defines a national agency check as including a check of the fingerprint files, Identification Division, FBI, and of the investigative files of the FBI.

## STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT
## THERE IS "DEROGATORY INFORMATION" IN THE FBI FILES

The standards for determining what is derogatory information is such information that shall relate, but shall not be limited to, those facts described in subdivisions (1-8) of Section 8(a).

## POLICIES FOR DISSEMINATION OF SUCH DEROGATORY INFORMATION

Section 5 of EO 10450 provides:

Whenever there is developed by any department or agency information indicating that the retention in employment of any officer or employee of the Government may not be clearly consistent with the interests of the national security, such information shall be forwarded to the head of the employing department or agency or his representatives....

If the FBI receives information coming within the provisions of this section, the FBI has the responsibility to disseminate it whether it be of a suitability or loyalty nature. Chapter 735 of the Federal Personnel Manual contains language similar to that in Section 5. The conditions for the types of derogatory information involved are set forth in Section 8 (a) of the Order.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Supplement Number 4 (revised) of Departmental
Order 3464, signed by the Attorney General on January 13,
1953, provides that all files, documents, records and reports
in the Department of Justice shall be regarded as of a
confidential nature.

The Attorney General by memorandum dated December 5,
1947, advised the Bureau that the practice in passing along
to the various government departments and agencies information
which comes to its attention in connection with the conducting
of investigations, normally and regularly within the Bureau's
jurisdiction, is entirely appropriate and correct. The Attorney
General added that it would appear that the Bureau would be
remiss in its duty if it failed to pass along information
coming to it which might prove in the interest of the general
welfare. He added that it is not the Bureau's responsibility
to determine whether the information is or is not of importance
to the particular agency in the carrying out of its current
activities and responsibility, and whether or not any action
is taken by the department or agency is not, of course, a
principal concern of the Bureau. The Attorney General advised,
therefore, that in his opinion the Bureau should continue to
pass along information, which it is believed might be of
interest to the various departments and agencies.

It should be noted that our FBI reports distributed
to outside agencies are stamped as the property of the FBI with
this additional notation," This document contains neither
recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI and is leaned to your
agency: it and its contents are not to be distributed outside
your agency."

FBI memorandum dated August 14, 1974, (enclosed), to
the Assistant Attorney General for Administration, copies for
the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and
for the Director, Department Security Staff, confirmed the
results of investigations of individuals pursuant to EO 10450
be furnished, where pertinent, to the Director, Department
Security Staff.

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

The memorandum pointed out that, as in the past,
these reports are furnished to the Department in order that
consideration may be given as to whether any Federal laws
have been violated and for information concerning possible
subversive infiltration into the Executive Branch of the
Government.

With regard to a determination as to whether any
Federal laws have been violated, it was noted the violations
generally involve Title 18, U.S. Code 1001, and a response is
received from the Criminal Division.

Information concerning subversive infiltration
into the Executive Branch is furnished for the Department's
assistance in discharging its responsibilities under
Section 13 of EO 10450.

The Assistant Attorney General for Administration,
by memorandum dated August 26, 1974, (enclosed), advised that
the practice as outlined in the memorandum of August 14, 1974,
satisfies the needs of the Department.

As the result of reorganization in the Department,
these reports are now sent to the Director, Security and
Administrative Services Staff.

## CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE FBI WILL CONDUCT ITS
## OWN INVESTIGATION OF A PROSPECTIVE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE

With regard to Sections 5 and 8(d), supra, the FBI
sent a memorandum dated May 1, 1953, (enclosed), to the
Deputy Attorney General pointing out that the FBI contemplated
following the policy in existence under EO 9835 (Federal
Employee Loyalty Program) of initiating an investigation based
on available information rather than awaiting a request for
such an investigation under EO 10450 from the interested
department or agency. It was stated that if this practice
was in conflict with the provisions of EO 10450, consideration
could be given to clarification in subsequent regulations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

In reply the Deputy Attorney General on June 25, 1953, (enclosed), advised he did not believe the policy outlined in the memorandum dated May 1, 1953, to be in conflict with any provision of EO 10450 and saw no reason why the FBI should not continue this policy.

The FBI has continued the practice approved in the Department's memorandum of June 25, 1953, and by memorandum dated January 23, 1976, to the Deputy Attorney General, the Department was advised that this policy still continues under the provisions of EO 10450.

Dear Concerned Citizen:

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me regarding the work of the Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. I am sorry to learn that you are unable to endorse the Committee's investigation and the efforts which have been undertaken to strengthen the Nation's intelligence agencies through closer definitions of their legal authority and areas of legitimate operation.

One of the possible abuses under investigation is the violation of the First and Fourth Amendment rights of Americans under the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The American system of government is unique in that it not only permits, but encourages, its citizens to voice their views on important issues. One of the rights we are trying to protect is your right to express your thoughts to me, either over the telephone or through the mails, without having your message intercepted or recorded by unauthorized persons. Highly sophisticated equipment now makes it possible to turn our surveillance techniques, which were originally designed to intercept foreign transmissions, inward against ourselves. It is important that provision be made for the lawful use of this capability, and that protection be assured our own citizens who could become the unwitting victims of this unconstitutional but nevertheless powerful surveillance technology.

I want to take this opportunity to assure you that the Committee's purpose is not, as some have suggested, to destroy, degrade, or even disrupt the legitimate functions of the intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies of the United States. On the contrary, its purpose is to fortify these valid and vital areas of operation. However, we do intend to identify abuses or patterns of abuses which are clearly unlawful and take action to prevent their recurrence, whether they involve individuals or nations. We as individuals must live within the law; so must our Government and its agencies.

I appreciate your taking the time to write to me, and trust that the ultimate outcome of this investigation will strengthen the faith of our people in the integrity of their Government.

With all kind wishes.

Sincerely,

![signature of Frank Church]

RE: FALL OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM
NOVEMBER 12-16, 1969
INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (NMC) is coordinating efforts for a massive antiwar manifestation to take place in Washington, D. C., November 12-16, 1969. This group maintains a Washington, D. C., office at 1029 Vermont Avenue, Northwest, where the planning takes place.

This demonstration could possibly attract the largest number of demonstrators ever to assemble in Washington, D. C. The large number is cause for major concern should violence of any type break out. It is necessary for this Bureau to keep abreast of events as they occur, and we feel that in this instance advance knowledge of plans and possible areas of confrontation would be most advantageous to our coverage and to the safety of individuals and property. Accordingly, we are requesting authorization to install a telephone surveillance on the Washington office of the NMC.

Interception will be made without trespass and maximum security will be guaranteed. Because of extensive contacts of the organization involved, it cannot be anticipated whether individuals who are or may be placed under an active investigation for possible criminal violations will be overheard by this coverage.

Respectfully,

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

RE: FALL OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM
NOVEMBER 12-16, 1969
INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (NMC) is sponsoring a massive antiwar manifestation to take place in Washington, D. C., on November 12-16, 1969. The Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (SMC) and the Vietnam Moratorium Committee (VMC) are closely coordinating their efforts with NMC in organizing the demonstration. NMC, SMC and VMC occupy adjoining office space at 1029 Vermont Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C.

SMC is completely dominated and controlled by the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and its youth affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). The VMC has recently endorsed fully the activities of NMC concerning the upcoming antiwar demonstration.

This demonstration could possibly attract the largest number of demonstrators ever to assemble in Washington, D. C., which is cause for major concern should violence of any type break out. It is necessary for this Bureau to keep abreast of events as they occur, and we feel advance knowledge of plans and possible areas of confrontation during the demonstration would be most advantageous to our coverage and to the safety of individuals and property.

We have separately requested authorization to install a telephone surveillance on the office of NMC. To further implement our coverage, we are requesting authorization to install telephone surveillances on the offices of SMC and VMC.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemination outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel without the express approval of the FBI.

Interception will be made without trespass and maximum security will be guaranteed.

# Hon. Frank Church
U.S. Senate
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sen. Church:

By way of background, I served honorably with both the Federal Bureau of Inve- igation and the Central Intelligence Agency for a combined total of over 33 years. I am proud of my service with each agency and I feel that my activities were quite worthwhile and in the national interest. I am a graduate of George Washington University Law School and a member of the bar. I am now retired.

As an interested and intellectually curious citizen, I have been reading accounts in the public press concerning the activities of the committee which you happen to chair and of the House Committee which Rep. Otis Pike happens to chair, both dealing with the U.S. investigative and intelligence programs. Briefly stated, I am totally nauseated by the irresponsible way in which both of you demand highly sensitive and classified data which seems to be publicized soon after you get it. It is my opinion and that of many friends that your committees are effectively destroying the credibility of these agencies and making impossible their effective performance in the future.

Before going further, let me state that I do not condone irregularities, improprieties or illegalities by either agency in their normal, routine activities but I do see the justification, in serious security or Mafia like criminal activities, for certain "extracurricular" activities to achieve needed ends and I think that the Congress should quietly recognize such, with reasonable controls. You should be proud and complimentary, for instance in my opinion,about the highly publicized and often misrepresented mail intercept program when you stop to realize that it was confined to mail to and from Russia and, insofar as I read, the results were given appropriate safeguards.

I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to having appropriate administrative action taken against offending employees and officials, if their rights are protected. What I do strongly object to is the pathetically inept and horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inquiries on sensitive matters are regularly reported, sometimes incompletely and for apparent political reasons. It just seems to me that someone connected with your committees is afflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels them to babble without regard to common sense or the welfare of our intelligence programs and, as I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.

I am sure that the intelligence organizations of all major nations make some mistakes. But have you ever seen the British, the French, the Russians, the Germans, the Israeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring circus" on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discredit? I am sure also that we are the laughing stock of all the above enumerated nations. What foreign official will entrust sensitive and confidential data to U.S. intelligence agents in the foreseeable future when he knows that he may soon see his data publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? I very sincerely feel that strong administrative and/or criminal action should be taken in any cases where either or both of your committees and/or their personnel have been the vehicle for embarrassing or damaging the U.S. by actions which resulted in confidential data being reported.

In order that there be no misunderstanding, this letter represents nothing more than my very sincere conviction of great personal contempt and disgust with the way in which you and your committees have done a great disservice to the United States by sadly mishandling your responsibilities to these agencies and to our nation.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: REQUEST FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OF
"KISSINGER-17"

Reference is made to SSC letter dated July 9, 1975, page three, paragraph two, subsection A, requesting materials in Bureau files relating to electronic surveillance of the so-called "Kissinger-17," and Department letter to the SSC dated July 15, 1975, captioned "Access/Delivery of Documents Requested in Senate Select Committee Letter of July 9, 1975," which letter sets forth arrangements that had been agreed upon on July 11, 1975, by representatives of the Department of Justice and the SSC concerning the manner in which the Bureau will respond to the above.

In accordance with the above agreement, SSC Staff Member James Dick on February 18, 1976, appeared at FBI Headquarters and prepared a longhand summary based on his review of material relating to the so-called "Kissinger-17." Mr. Dick requested that his summary be approved by appropriate officials and forwarded to the SSC on an expedite basis.

Attached is the original of the above summary prepared by Mr. Dick in his handwriting. In accordance with prior request of the SSC, excisions from the summary, for reasons of privacy, have not been made by this Bureau, but are being considered the responsibility of the SSC.

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: REQUEST FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE OF "KISSINGER-17"

NOTE:

The above agreement referred to in referenced Department letter states that material in FBI files relating to the "Kissinger-17" surveillance would be made available for review to SSC personnel at FBIHQ. These personnel may take such notes as deemed appropriate which notes were to be left in secure location at FBIHQ during the time the SSC study was in progress. When the study was completed, the SSC was to prepare a summary of the information considered appropriate for Committee use. The summary would be checked to ensure the protection of national security matters, protection of confidential sources of information and observation of privacy considerations. Thereafter, the approved summary would be furnished to the Committee and Staff notes destroyed. Mr. Dick on July 16 and 17, 1975, reviewed the material relating to the "Kissinger-17" and left his notes in possession of Bureau personnel. On 2/17/76, Mr. Dick requested permission to return to FBIHQ to review the above notes and prepare his summary which he did on 2/18/76. The summary prepared by Mr. Dick can be placed into two categories: (a) Political or personal information obtained from the tesurs which was disseminated to individuals at the White House and (b) a list of the targets and the dates the coverage was in operation for each target comprising the "Kissinger-17." Review of this summary indicates that no confidential sources of this Bureau are jeopardized, and there appears to be no jeopardy to national security matters. Regarding the latter, however, it is felt that the White House would be in the best position to pass final judgement in this matter.

It is to be noted that the matter of tesur coverage of some members of the "Kissinger-17" is currently in litigation.

The following notes were taken by James Dick, Senate Select Committee Staff, on February 18, 1976, based on a review of the file on the seventeen wiretaps which occurred between May 1969 and February 1971. These notes contain two types of summaries: (a) essentially political or personal information which was obtained from the wiretaps and disseminated to Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman, and/or President Nixon, and (b) a list of the targets and the dates the coverage was in operation for each.

questions be provided in both classified and
nonclassified forms. Pursuant to this request the FBI
has prepared nonclassified answers to all questions.
There was no need to prepare answers in a classified
form.

It is to be noted that on June 13, 1975, and
November 21, 1975, the SSC was furnished with documents
relating to various questions proposed by the SSC
concerning the disappearance of Thomas Riha. With the
submission on November 21, 1975, the enclosures
represented the entire information available at FBI
Headquarters (FBIHQ), including the Identification
Division, with reference to this matter. Any document
now being furnished to you was obtained from the Denver
Office of the FBI and was not previously available at
FBIHQ.

ACTIVITIES (SSC)

1. Question: Does the FBI know the whereabouts of Riha--whether he is alive or dead? Where?

Answer: The FBI does not know the whereabouts of Riha or whether he is alive or dead.

2. Question: Was Riha known to the Agency? If so, when first known and why?

Answer: All information relating to the FBI's knowledge of Riha has been previously furnished to the SSC. The first communication pertaining to Riha was a memorandum from CIA dated October 27, 1958. This memorandum was furnished the SSC on June 13, 1975.

3. Question: Was Riha employed by FBI? If so, in what capacity? Dates of employment?

Answer: Riha was not employed by the FBI.

4. Question: In March or April 1969 or thereafter, did Mrs. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum of Denver and Boulder, Colorado, contact the FBI in Colorado or Washington to assure the FBI that missing University of Colorado Professor Thomas Riha was alive and well and had left his home for personal reasons on March 15, 1969? If so, who in the FBI received this information and to whom was this information passed on in the FBI and the CIA? When was this done?

Answer: Mrs. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum did not contact the FBI in March or April, 1969, for any reason. On May 14, 1969, she was contacted by Special Agents of the FBI at her residence in Denver, Colorado, in connection with an investigation involving charges that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 148

# U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC)

she had impersonated an officer of the U. S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service. There is no record that
Riha was discussed during this contact. A letter from
the Denver Office of the FBI dated February 12, 1970,
reported that on January 28, 1970, she was interviewed
by Special Agents of the FBI at Boulder City Jail, Boulder,
Colorado, at which time sho offered the opinion that Riha
had decided to leave Doulder duo to marital difficultics
and personal clashes with other members of the faculty at
the University of Colorado. She listed a number of
telephonic and personal contacts she had had with him
subsequent to March, 1969.

The communication reporting the May 14, 1969,
contact does not list the names of the Special Agents who
contacted hor, however, the communication was prepared by
Special Agent Merrill R. Smith. At that time Special Agent
Smith and Special Agent J. Hale McMenamin were the only
Agents assigned at Boulder, Colorado. As the SSC was
previously advised on November 21, 1975, the January 22,
1970, communication from Denver FBI to FBIHQ could not be
located and therefore it cannot be determined who at FBIIN
received it or if the information was passed to CIA.

The letter from the Denver Office to FBIIR on
February 12, 1970, was initialed by a case supervisor in
the General Investigative Division and a case supervisor
in the Intelligence Division. Other than the information
following in response to question number 5, there is no
indication that the information was passed to CIA.

5. Question: Was this or other information passed
   on by the FBI to the CIA or to other agencies and the
   Denver and Boulder police? What was the information
   conveyed? When was this done?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Answer: The report of the interview of Tannenbaum on January 28, 1970, was included in a memorandum which was furnished to FBIHQ by communication from Denver dated February 12, 1970, captioned "Galya Tannenbaum, aka, Impersonation." The memorandum was disseminated at FBINQ to CIA, Secret Service, State Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and Defense Intelligence Agency. The memorandum was furnished to the U. S. Attorney, Denver, Colorado, by the Denver FBI Office. There is no indication that the information was passed to the Denver or Boulder police.

6. Question: Why did FBI say in 1969 and 1970--
   and continues to say now--that it conducted no investigation of Riha's disappearance when it is known that FBI agents talked in 1969 and 1970 with friends of Riha about his disappearance?

Answer: The FBI said in 1969 and 1970 and continues to say now that it conducted no investigation of Riha's disappearance because from the outset of his disappearance to now, the FBI has never conducted any investigation into the disappearance of Thomas Riha. Reference is made to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of Denver FBI letter to the Director dated February 12, 1970, supra, previously furnished to the SSC on November 21, 1975, which read as follows: "All persons interviewed in this investigation were specifically advised by interviewing Agents that the purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether Galya Tannenbaum had in any way violated Federal statutes concerning impersonation. Interviewees were specifically advised


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 150

STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPIRATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC)

investigation was not in any way connected with the
dissapearance of Thomas Riha, a currently missing
Assistant Professor of History at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, Colorado.

"This statement was made to interviewees
because the Denver Office has received inquiries by
news media concerning Riha's disappearance and they
have been specifically advised there is no evidence
relating to his disappearance showing any violation of
Federal law over which this Bureau has jurisdiction.
The circumstances of his disappearance suggest a missing
person situation and that investigation is being handled
by the Boulder Police Department."

"Because of the close personal relationship
between Tannenbaum and Riha, it would be possible,
without the above statement by interviewing Agents, that
interviewees could gain the impression the FBI is
investigating the disappearance instead of the
impersonation of a Federal officer by Tanncabaum."

"Pursuant to current Bureau instructions, this
office is not and has not conducted any investigation
concerning Riha."

7. Question: Why, in January or February 1970,
   did an FBI agent at the Denver office refuse to accompany
   CIA Agent Michael Todorovich from Boulder to see then
   Denver District Attorney Mike McKevitt? Was it made known
   by the CIA agent that the purpose of the visit was to caso
   the pressure on issuance of a subpoena to Dr. Joseph Smiley,
   former president of the University of Colorado? (Under
   such a subpoena, Smiley might have been required to reveal
   the agency that had given him the April 1900 report that
   Riha was alive and well at that time.)

Answer: The only information with reference to the contact betweon former Special Agent in Chargo Scott J. Werner and CIA agent Mike Todorovich is con- tained in Denver FBI letter to Director dated February 12, 1970, captioned "Thomas Riha," previously furnished to the SSC on June 13, 1975.

8. Question: In December 1969, when Riba's dying mother, Dr. kuth Ann Cook of Taunus, West Germany, contacted the FBI in Washington about her missing son, she was very anxious to "do anything" to determine where he was and what had happened to him. Yet the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) said in December 1960, that Mrs. Cook declined the FBI's offer to place a missing persons notice on Riha in the FBI bulletin. What information did the FBI furnish Mrs. Cook to lead her to make this unlikely decision not to pursuo all possible ways to find out what happened to her son?

Answer: All reports of communications between Dr. Ruth Ann Cook, mother of Thomas Riha, and the FBI, were furnished to the SSC on November 21, 1975.

9. Question: Was Dr. Cook connected with the FBI in any way at any time? In what capacity? When?

Answer: Dr. Cook was not connected with the FBI in any way at any time.

10. Question: Was Mrs. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum ever employed by the FBI? For what purpose or purposes? Was she hired to check on Leonard Carlin, Chicago attorney who was active in defending antiwar activists in the 1960s?

FBI from Chicago to the Boulder-Denver, Colorado, area
in 1968 for any reason.

12. Question: What knowledge does the FBI have
    on Riha's translations of Czechoslovakian tapes for
    Mrs. Tannenbaum in March 1969, before he disappeared?

    hospital?

**Answer:** The only knowledge the FBI has con-
cerning Tannenbaum's reported suicide at the Colorado
State Hospital in March, 1971, was obtained from
newspaper clippings previously furnished to the SSC on
November 21, 1975. The FBI is not acquainted directly
or indirectly with Henry Madrid, a technician at the
hospital, other than through his mention in the above

NOTE:

Zdenek Cerveny and Francesca Stein were
interviewed at Lyons, Colorado, 1/21/70, by Special
Agents Merrill R. Smith and J. Hale McMenamin.
Joyce Lebra was interviewed by the same Agents on
1/21/70 at Boulder, Colorado.

Professor Donald Fanger is the subject of
Security Matter - C, Bureau file 100-408465, opened
in January, 1954, when there was indication he supported
Communist Party policies and closed 1964 when investigation
indicated he did not qualify under Bureau's criteria for
inclusion on the Security Index and his activities did not
appear to warrant investigation. The only known connection
between Fanger and Riha is that they were both included in
a group of American graduate students selected to attend
Moscow or Lenigrad University in 1952-1959 in exchange for
twenty Soviet graduate students.

Professor Oldrich Leska is the subject of
Internal Security - Czechoslovakia, Bureau file 105-19779.
Leska, born 6/16/27 Czechoslovakia, was in the U. S. from
7/17/68 to 9/5/68 and again from 10/15/68 until 6/8/70
when he returned to Czechoslovakia. He was in the U. S.
under the East-West Exchange Program. During the earlier
visit and from October, 1963, until the Summer of 1969, he
was at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, and
from the Summer of 1969 until June, 1970, he was at the
University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. The file was
opened on the basis of an unusual telephone call received
by a third party from Ljubo Majhanovich. Apparently
Majhanovich, then living in Toronto, Canada, had attended
the University of Colorado from 1966-69 where he had become
friendly with Leska. Majhanovich was born in Yugoslavia,

ZDENEK CERVENY, care of Black Bear Inn, Lyons, Colorado, was interviewed at this establishment and advised he was born December 5, 1938, in Jihlava, Czechoslovakia, and holds a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Czechoslovakia Technical University, Prague, Czechoslovakia. He stated he is the nephew of THOMAS RIHA, a Professor of Russian History at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. He is currently employed as a plant engineer with the Martin-Marietta Cement Company in Lyons, Colorado.

According to CERVENY, he came to the United States on November 9, 1968, from Vienna, Austria, destined for the residence of his uncle in Boulder, Colorado. He stated that upon arrival in New York City, he spent several days at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. R. V. GROSSMAN in Brooklyn, New York, who are the aunt and uncle of HANA RIHA, the former wife of THOMAS RIHA.

CERVENY continued that he arrived in Denver, Colorado, via Greyhound Bus on November 16, 1968, and immediately called THOMAS RIFA at his residence in Boulder. He was advised by RIHA that he would be unable to come to Denver to drive him back to Boulder, but that he would have a friend meet him at the bus station. lie stated that approximately one hour later a woman who introduced herself as CALYA TANNENBAUM approached him at the bus station and thereafter úrove him to the residence or THOMAS RIHA at 1655 - 8th Street, Boulder, Colorado. He advised that after TANNENBAUK departed the RIHA residence, his uncle told him that she was a very important persen, and the one who had been influential in getting him into the United States.

CERVENY stated he resided with RIHA from November 16, 1968, until January 8, 1969, when he moved to 918 South Logan Street, Denver, Colorado, in order to be closer to the Samsonite Company where he had secured employment in the Research and Development Laboratory. During the period he resided with his uncle, TANNENBAUM visited this residence on several occasions, and on almost every instance reminded him that she was an officer in Military Intelligence; very influential with authorities of the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service; and that if he did not behave himself in the United States, she would have him sent back to Czechoslovakia. CERVENY stated he never was certain

what, if anything, TANNENBAUM actually did in connection with his being admitted to the United States, as the matter, to his knowledge, was handled by a Czechoslovakian Refugee Committee in New York City.

CERVENY went on to state that after he moved to Denver he did not see TANNENBAUM again until March 13, 1969, when she called him on the telephone and suggested he come to her residence at 248 Logan Street, where his uncle was also visiting her. He stated when he arrived at her house, his uncle seemed depressed and upset over the fact that he was having marital difficulties with HANA, and that the marriage would probably terminate in divorce. He stated the purpose of his being invited to TANNENBAUM's residence appeared to emanate from a desire of his uncle to see him, but that nothing of importance occurred during the visit.

Following the disappearance of his uncle on March 15, 1969, he stated TANNENBAUM commenced asking him over to her house on the pretense of checking up on his immigrant status; however, it became immediately apparent that the principal purpose of these invitations was an attempt on the part of TANNENBAUM to have sexual relations with him. He pointed out there were times when he entered her residence when she would be partially unclothed, would attempt to sit on his lap, sit close to him while watching television, or would openly suggest that they go to her bedroom for the purpose of having sexual intercourse. CERVENY stated TANNENBAUM was physically repulsive to him, and that he would find an immediate excuse to leave when she commenced making sexual advances to him.

During the period when he was visiting the TANNENBAUM residence, CERVENY advised she suggested that she adopt him, and actually started adoption proceedings through an attorney in Denver, STEPHEN L. R. MC NICHOLS, JR.; however, he stated he had no desire whatsoever to go through with this, and told TANNENBAUM so. He stated it was about this time that he began to suspect that TANNENBAUM had no connection with Military Intelligence or had any influence over his immigration status.

He stated that in May, 1969, he desired to go to Toronto, Canada, to attent a wedding of some Czechoslovakian friends, and he inquired of TANNENBAUM if such would be legal for him to do. He stated she told him there was nothing for him to worry about; however, she suggested he consult with Immigration authorities in Denver regarding this trip. According to CERVENY, TANNENBAUM acccním him to the Federal vilar: Comer, but refused to them to 31 excuse that she has case.

the United States for Canada, he would not be able to return. When he informed TANNENBAUM of this, she told him that she had more authority than the Immigration officials, and advised him to go to Canada regardless, as she outranked the officials in Denver. CERVENY then made the trip to Canada without incident, and learned later that he was actually just fortunate that he was not required to produce citizenship papers at any time.

In addition, CERVENY stated that in May, 1969, he met a Czechoslovakian girl in Colorado Springs by the name of MICHEL BDLIKOVA, who was working at the Broadmoor Hotel, and whom he eventually introduced to TANNENBAUM. He stated that TANNENBAUM immediately told the girl of her Military Intelligence and Immigration connections, and advised her that she could arrange to get her a passport to visit relatives in Czechoslovakia. He stated that in October, 1969, BDLIKOVA told him that TANNENBAUM had recently approached her with a letter written in English purportedly from THOMAS RIHA to CERVENY. He stated BDLIKOVA was asked by TANNENBAUM to rewrite the letter in Czechoslovakian, and that he eventually received this letter postmarked from somewhere in Canada. He felt at the time he received the letter that it had not been written by his uncle, and when he was advised by BDLIKOVA that the letter was a hoax, he began to feel that TANNENBAUM was a fraud and that his uncle's disappearance could have been for reasons other than marital discord. He stated that immeidately after being told of the letter by BDLIKOVA in October, 1969, he filed a missing persons notice with the Boulder, Colorado Police Department the following day. He stated the last time he saw TANNENBAUM was just before or after he made this report to the Boulder Police Department.

With regard to CERVENY's association with GALYA TANNENBAUM, he recalled that on several occasions she told him that she would like to recruit him into Military Intelligence, as his engineering background and language ability would be "extremely useful to us." She also told him that if he were in the United States "working for the other side," she would shoot him. TANNEN-BAUM also told CERVENY that she had originally met THOMAS RIHA in Chicago, and that after she came to Colorado, he followed her for the purpose of marrying her; however, the marriage did not take place as RIHA was unable to get along with her children. He stated that upon reflection, he feels that his uncle actually believed that TANNENBAUM was connected in some official capacity with the United States Government, and that there was something in their relationship which he feels gave TANNENBAUM some type of influence over the actions of his uncle; however, in conversation with berh his uncle and TAMENPAUN, ne can recall nothing of a concrete nature, and that feeling is protasly a result or antuition more than

CERVENY also recalled that in December, 1968, his father visited him, and during the visit, showed him a diamond bracelet which he had smuggled into the United States for the purpose of selling for a relative in Czechoslovakia. He stated his father had previously corresponded with another individual by the name of RIHA in San Antonio, Texas, who was no relation to his uncle, but whom his father had known in Czechoslovakia. According to CERVENY, his father made a trip to San Antonio to leave this bracelet with the RIHA in San Antonio for him to attempt to sell; however, the bracelet was eventually returned to CERVENY from the RIHA in San Antonio, who advised him he could locate no buyer. Thereafter, he showed the bracelet to TANNEN-BAUM, who indicated a desire to buy it. Both went to a jeweler in the Denver Hilton Hotel, who appriased the bracelet at $350. TANNENBAUM, however, offered him $500 for the bracelet, and actually paid him $400 in cash with a promise to pay him an additional $100 later, which he never received.

CERVENY recalled another incident which furthered his suspicions of TANNENBAUM in regard to a will which he witnessed at her insistence. By way of background, he explained that in the spring of 1969, TANNENBAUM introduced him to an elderly man by the name of GUSTAV FREDERICH INGWERSEN, a plastics engineer and a native of Germany, who owned some type of plastics plant in Denver, Colorado. He stated he had formerly done some work in plastics, and TANNENBAUM suggested that INGWERSEN might help him get established in this field. As a result of this meeting, CERVENY became friendly with INGWERSEN, and in the company of TANNENBAUM and her two children, made two vacation trips to New Mexico with him. He stated these trips were in either April or May, 1969, and in June, 1969, TANNENBAUM advised him that INGWERSEN had died. Then on July 5, 1969, TANNENBAUM had him visit her residence where she told him that INGWERSEN had drawn up a will and signed it prior to his death, but had neglected to have two witnesses sign it in accordance with Colorado law. She said that INGWERSEN liked CERVENY and had intended to ask him to witness the will, but had died before this could be accomplished. She then coaxed him for over an hour to witness this document, and still believing she was a bona fide official in some Governmental capacity, he affixed his signature to the will.

CERVENY concluded by stating that TANNENBAUM had never obtained anything of value from him as a result of her represen-
taibons as an officer in litery Entelligense, and the longer

5. 
he remained in the United States and became acquainted with life in this country, the more suspicious he became that TANNENBAUM was in some way attempting to eventually try to capitalize in some way on his immigrant status. He again pointed out, however that to his knowledge, TANNENBAUM was never able to materially obtain anything of value from him.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
Date January 27, 1970

Mrs. FRANCESCA STEIN, nee Friedel, owner of the Black
Bear Inn, Lyons, Colorado, advised she is a citizen of Czechoslo-
vakia, and has been in the United States for approximately four
years. She stated that in about October, 1967, a Mr. STABEN, a
visiting Professor from France at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, Colorado, and a frequent customer at the Black Bear inn,
introduced her to a Professor of History at the University of
Colorado by the name of THOMAS RIHA, also a native of Czechoslo-
vakia, and that thereafter she and her husband became friendly
with RIHA.

Mrs. STEIN advised that in April, 1968, RIHA visited
the restaurant in the company of a Czechoslovakian citizen by the
name of JIRI CERVENY, who advised her that he had a son, ZDENEK
CERVENY, who had recently escaped from Czechoslovakia into Vienna,
Austria. She stated JIRI CERVENY was from Prague and that ZDENEK
CERVENY is a nephew of RIHA. They inquired if Mrs. STEIN would be
able to assist his son in coming to the United States, particularly.
with regard to obtaining employment for him. Mrs. STEIN advised
both RIHA and CERVENY that she would attempt to assist in this
endeavor through her attorney, PAUL MORRIS, in Boulder, Colorado.

Mrs. STEIN recalled that in September 1968, MORRIS
and RIHA visited her residence in Lyons concerr.ng ZDENEK CERVENY,
at which time MORRIS told her that he knew a woman from Denver,
Colorado, by the name of GALYA TANNENBAUM who had a great deal of
influence in the Government, and who was referred to by RIHA as
"Colonel." She stated that MORRIS and RIHA advised her that
TANNENBAUM would be able to assist them in getting ZDENEK CERVENY
into the United States.

According to Mrs. STEIN, shortly after this meeting with
MORRIS and RIHA, TANNENBAUM visited the restaurant in Lyons to
discuss the bringing of ZDENEK CERVENY to the United States. She
told Mrs. STEIN it would be necessary to first check out Mrs. STEIN
and RIHA for security purposes before bringing CERVENY into this
country. She told her that she was a "Colonel in the Immigration,"
and showed her a small hand gun which she had in her purse. During
this conversation, TANNENBAUM told Mrs. STEIN that she belonged to
an extermination group which killed people after the second World
War. Mrs. STEIN stated she considered TANNENBAUM to be a "nut" and
did not pursue the matter any further with her, pointing out that

as far as she was concerned, the immigration matter concerning CERVENY would be handled by her attorney, PAUL MORRIS.

Mrs. STEIN continued that in October, 1968, RIHA married a young Czechoslovakian girl by the name of HANA HRUSKOVA, and that subsequent to the marriage, a reception was held at the Black Bear Inn. She stated that while the reception was in progress, TANNENBAUM appeared, uninvited, and immediately sought out RIHA, took him to the bar section of the restaurant, and commenced a long, serious conversation with him which lasted for approximately one hour. She stated that RIHA's bride became extremely upset over this, as TANNENBAUM would not allow anyone to interrupt their conversation. Mrs. STEIN advised that on one occasion she went into the bar to tell RIHA that his bride was becoming very upset, and was answered in an angry manner by TANNENBAUM to "leave them alone." Following this conversation, the content of which is unknown to Mrs. STEIN, she stated RIHA appeared to be extremely upset, and although TANNENBAUM left immediately, RIHA seemed to have lost all interest in the reception.

Following the incident during the wedding reception, Mrs. STEIN advised that TANNENBAUM again visited her at the Black Bear Inn concerning the immigration case of ZDENEK CERVENY, during which she mentioned to TANNENBAUM that she owned some property in Lyons on which she desired to build an apartment house. At this time TANNENBAUM told her that she was a Colonel in Military Intelligence, and was soon to be promoted to the rank of General. She told Mrs. STEIN that she could utilize some influence in securing an FHA loan for her; that she had the authority to deport her at any time; and intimated to Mrs. STEIN that for a percentage of the loan obtained, she would obtain same; and if Mrs. STEIN did not agree to this arangement, she would have her deported. Mrs. STEIN again pointed out that she considered TANNENBAUM a "nut," and told her that all of immigration and business dealings were handled through her attorney.

Mrs. STEIN stated that to the best of her recollection, the above was the last time she saw TANNENBAUM, and in February, 1969, she made a trip to Columbia, South America, where she had resided for approximately ten years before coming to the United States, and did not again return to Lyons until March 18, 1969, following the disappearance of RIHA from Boulder, Colorado, on March 15, 1969.

Mrs STEIN stated she did not believe the representations made by TANNENBAUM that she was connected with the United States Immigration Service, or with Military Intelligence, and that she obtained nothing of value from her.

Mrs. STEIN advised that ZDENEK CERVENY eventually came to the United States in November, 1968, and to the best of her knowledge, TANNENBAUM had nothing to do with his entry into this country.

Miss JOYCE LEBRA, Associate Professor of History,
University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, 1590 Hillside Drive,
Boulder, advised she is a colleague of THOMAS RIHA in the
Department of History and considers herself a close personal
friend.

At the outset of the interview, it was explained to
LEBRA that the purpose of the interview was to ascertain any
available information from her concerning Mrs. GALYA TANNENBAUM
on whom this Bureau is conducting an investigation under the
Federal. Impersonation Statute.

Miss LEBRA advised that to the best of her recollection
RIHA never did mention anyone to her by the name of TANNENBAUM or
any individual connected with Military Intelligence or the United
States Immigration and Naturalization Service. She stated that
if TANNENBAUM had been a close friend of RIHA's, this fact would
probably have been known to her, as she and RIHA generally asso-
ciated with the same circle of friends in the University community.

# FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date: January 28, 1970.

STEPHEN FISCHER-GALATI, Professor, Department of History, University of Colorado, advised that he had just returned from a European trip. He recalled first meeting Professor THOMAS RIHA sometime in 1966 at a meeting of the American Historical Society in San Francisco. He advised he also had heard of RIHA prior to their meeting. He advised that after RIHA came to the University of Colorado he knew him as a fellow faculty member of the Department of History and had dinner with him on two or three occasions. He advised their relationship was casual and could not have been considered a profound relationship.

FISCHER-GALATI advised he first met GALYA TANNENBAUM sometime in May, 1969, after the disappearance of professor RIHA. He advised his object in meeting TANNENBAUM was to determine if she were a "colonel" as described in hearsay. He advised he was convinced she was not connected with any kind of intelligence work and knew nothing of Eastern European history. He recalled that TANNENBAUM stated she had known RIHA for many years and indicated she had helped RIHA come to the United States but gave no further explanation. He also recalled that TANNENBAUM displayed a "Power of Attorney" document which was contained in a letter allegedly signed by TOM RIHA. He advised the most significant part of the document to him was the date of same, which he easily recalled as January 5, 1968. FISCHER-GALATI pointed out that January 5, 1968, is the date of the overthrow of the Czechoslovakian Government, at which time NOVOTONY was replaced by DUBCEK, and at this same time the official who was in control of passports disappeared and subsequently showed up in Montreal, Canada. He recalled that TANNENBAUM indicated she carried a gun in her purse and that her car had some special equipment, but TANNENBAUM did not elaborate further. He advised that TANNENBAUM was extremely careful in her conversations with him and made no allegations.

FISCHER-GALATI advised his second meeting with TANNENBAUM occured on October 1, 1969, at 2:15 p.m., same obtained from his notebook. He recalled that TANNENBAUM called him on the telephone and arranged to meet him in front of the Colorado Book Store in Boulder. He recalled that her car was parked legally at the aforementioned location. He recalled that she was anxious to determine why a check had "bounced" in RIHA's bank account. He recalled she wanted to know if the University was continuing to deposit RIHA's salary to his bank account, as all University faculty

are paid, and she also wanted to see the receipt for the deposit of his salary per University records, He advised he had determined a discrepancy existed between what the University claimed to put into the account and what they actually put into RIHA's account. He advised at this meeting TANNENBAUM did not discuss RIHA'S whereabouts.

He recalled his third meeting with TANNENBAUM occured about five days later at the same location, although this time TANNENBAUM was accompanied by a small female child about three years of age. He advised her of the amount the University had deposited to RIHA's account. At this time TANNENBAUM told him her real name was not GALY TANNENBAUM, but something else which she did not disclose, and added that she was about ready to leave town. He advised of no contact with TANNENBAUM since their last meeting.

STEPHEN FISCHER-GALATI advised that the date of the document mentioned above of January 5, 1968, and its historical significance disturbs him. He stated if RIHA was not "bumped off" by TANNENBAUM, then he assumes that RIHA's disappearance may have been connected with an unknown intelligence matter, which is pure conjecture on his part. FISCHER-GALATI also recalled that in September, 1968, Professor RIHA requested that an advertisement for a travel bureau be run in the "Eastern European Quarterly," which GALATI described as an international journal to promote cultural contact with Eastern European Countries. He advised RIHA did not indicate if the advertisement was run for a friend or if RIHA had any financial interest in the travel agency named Treasure Tours, 1010 St. Catherine Way, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. FISCHER-GALATI advised that because of the reasons mentioned, he sometimes believes that RIHA could be in Canada.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI advised that in April, 1969, he contacted a Mr. FRITZ of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Denver, Colorado, regarding the sudden leaving of Professor THOMAS RIHA of the University of Colorado. Mr. FRITZ advised him that he had no knowledge of the matter but would check into same. Professor FISCHER-GALATI stated he was later recontacted by FRITZ, who stated the disappearance had nothing to do with the CIA and that RIHA's leaving was a personal matter connected with personal problems.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI explained that in the absence of a complete denial by Mr. FRITZ that the CIA had any dealings with RIHA at any time, he, therefore, concluded and was convinced the information furnished by Mr. FRITZ did not represent a personal opinion but must have come from within the CIA. He added that inasmuch as it then appeared to him that RIHA had left voluntarily, he also concluded he had no reason to fear for the safety of RIHA. Professor FISCHER-GALATI said that if he had been subsequently quoted in the "Colorado Daily" or any other newspaper as saying that RIHA had left voluntarily and was safe, such quotation would have been correct.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI continued that he did not feel, however, that the explanation about RIHA was adequate and for that reason subsequently directed a letter to the Chief of the Foreign Agents Registration section within the Justice Department, whom he knew well. He thereafter received a reply that the Chief to whom he directed the letter was deceased.

He stated he thereafter directed a second letter to the same section mentioned above within the Justice Department in mid-December, 1969, again inquiring about RIHA, but as yet has received no reply.

He stated he did not know of anything of value ever received by TANNENBAUM as a result of any representation.

Counsel Division, FBI, dated February 20, 1976, enclosing
SSC letter dated February 18, 1976.

Referenced letter requests interviews with FBI
Agents of the Chicago Office who prepared memoranda con-
cerning the Black Panther Party.

In view of current civil litigation involving
members of the Black Panther Party, and Agents of the FBI,
it is felt that it would not be proper to make these Agents
available for interview by the SSC at this time.

The FBI is in agreement with the Department's view
that a proper response would be to allow the SSC to review
transcripts of the Agents' testimony at the trial, concerning
these memoranda.

SUBJECT: SSC Letter Dated February 18, 1976

Attached is a letter from the Senate Select
Committee dated February 18, 1976, which requests
interviews with FBI agents who wrote various mem-
oranda concerning the Black Panther Party in Chicago.
Because such interviews might impair the Department's
ability to conduct a defense in the Hampton trial, in
Chicago, I have asked the Department attorneys hand-
ling that case to give us their views on an appropriate
response to Senator Church's letter. One possible re-
sponse would be to provide the SSC with the transcripts
of the FBI agents testimony at the trial concerning
these memoranda, instead of allowing the SSC to inter-
view these agents. We would appreciate it if the FBI
would also consider what response would be appropriate
.to this letter.

In our investigation into the FBI's counterintelligence activities
against the Black Panther Party in Chicago certain Bureau mémoranda

these memoranda and we would appreciate your forwarding to us the names
of other FBI personnel responsible for their preparation. We would
also like you to make the necessary arrangements for Select Committee
staff to be able to interview these persons.

Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Yours-very truly,.

On March 4, 1976, Mr. James Johnson of the FBI re- viewed the Select Committee's draft titled "CIA and FBI Mail Opening." James Dick and Thomas Dawson of the Committee staff revised the draft to meet all security problems previously raised by Mr. James Lee of the Bureau, and discussed the revisions with Mr. Johnson to make cer- tain that their concerns were met.

This letter is to confirm the fact that, unless I receive word to the contrary from you, the Department of Justice has no objection to the publication of this report.

Thanks again for your help throughout the inquiry into this subject.

Sincerely,

Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams DATE: 3/4/76

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

It was brought to the attention of the Legal Counsel Division that in the Senate Select Committee report concerning COINTELPRO the identities of Agents were contained which are below the level of Section Chief. The prior procedure and policy of the Senate Select Committee was not to include anybody below a policymaking position which it equated with Section Chief or above.

F. A. O. Schwartz, Counsel to captioned Committee, was contacted concerning this matter and Schwartz stated that he wanted to assure the Bureau that there would be no names of Agent personnel included in the report under the title of Section Chief. He indicated that their procedures and policies concerning utilization of the identity of Agent personnel will be consistent with the policies established by their Bureau mail opening report. This report was written by James Dick of the Committee and contains the identity of only one Section Chief and that is William A. Branigan. No one below the rank of Section Chief was identified. In fact, Dick did not identify SACs involved in this operation.

It was necessary to review this proposed draft in the offices of the SSC since they do not contemplate permitting proposed drafts to leave their premises. The approval for the use of information from the 2 classified documents has been coordinated with the IS-2 Section of the Intelligence Division and with the Budget and Accounting Section of the Administrative Division. The handling of the budget figure as set forth has been approved by Asst. Director E.W. Walsh.

STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
1- Mr. Newman

On February 19, 1976, at the invitation of
Staff Member Robert Kelley of the SSC, Supervisors
Edward P. Grigalus and Homer A. Newman, Jr., reviewed
the proposed draft of the Committee's report as it
pertains to informants in the domestic security field.
This review was conducted for the purpose of deter-
mining if the report contained any information which
would expose our informants or jeopardize any ongoing
investigations or investigative techniques in the
domestic internal security field as it pertains to
informants. This review did not detect any such
instances.

Two instances were noted, however, where
information was set forth taken from classified docu-
ments.

(1) In connection with internal security -
intelligence program supports, through the use of
informants, a figure of $7,401,000 was used in the
Committee's draft. This figure was taken from material
captioned "Federal Bureau of Investigation Overall
Intelligence Program, FY 77 Budget Compared to FY 76
(Dollars in Thousands)," classified "Secret," which
was made available to the SSC by the Department.
Although the document described above cannot be declassi-
fied, the FBI interposes no objection to the use of the
above figure in the SSC report providing the report
so reflects that this figure not only includes payments
made to domestic internal security informants for ser-
vices and expenses but also includes the cost of our

(2) The Committee's draft under "Case No. 5"
sets forth information regarding "Fublic Meeting Oppoς-

information was taken from a classified document cap-
tioned "Universities Committee on Problems of War and
Peace" dated March 2, 1966.

The FBI cannot declassify this document since
it contains information warranting its continued class-
ification; however, the information as set forth in the
Committee's draft would be unclassifiable as it appears.
Therefore, the FBI does not interpose any objection to
the use of this material.

Case No. 5--Public Meeting Opposing U.S. Involvement in Vietnam War
(1965)

Informers were used extensively in FBI investigations of possible Communist links to the antiwar movement. An example is the FBI's coverage of various antiwar teach-ins and conferences sponsored by the Universities Committee on Problems of War and Peace. A forty-one page report from the Philadelphia office--based on coverage by thirteen informants and confidential sources--described in complete detail a "public hearing on Vietnam." A Communist Party official had "urged all CP members" in the area to attend, and one of the organizers was alleged to have been a Communist in the early 1950's. Upon receipt from an informant of a list of the speakers, the FBI culled its files for data on their backgrounds. One was described by a source as a Young Socialist Alliance "sympathizer."

![background image]

NW 88326 DocId:32989603 Page 208


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

Another was a conscientious objector to military service. A third
had contributed $5.000 to the National Committee to Abolish the
House Committee on Un-American Activities. A speaker representing
the W.E.B. DuBois Club was identified as a Communist. The FBI
covered the meeting with an informant who reported practically
verbatim the remarks of all the speakers, including the following:

*   The Chairman of the Philadelphia Ethical Society
*   A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union
*   A representative of the United Electrical Workers
*   A spokesman for the Young Americans for Freedom
*   A member of the staff of the "Catholic Worker"
*   A minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church
*   A minister of the Episcopal Church
*   A representative of the Philadelphia Area Committee to
    End the War in Vietnam
*   A Professor of Industrial Economics at Columbia University
*   A répresentative of the Inter-University Committee for
    Debate on Foreign Policy
*   A member of Women's Strike for Peace who had traveled to
    North Vietnam
*   A member of Women's International League for Peace and
    Freedom who had visited South Vietnam
*   A chaplin from Rutgers University
*   A professor of political science from Villanova University
*   Another member of Young Americans: for Freedom
*   The former Charge d'Affaires in the South Vietnamese Embassy

This informant's report was so extensive as to be the equivalent of
a tape rècording, although the FBI report does not indicate that the
informant was "wired." Another informant reported the remarks of
additional participants.

*   An official of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy
*   A minister of the church of the Brethren
*   A Unitarian minister
*   A representative of United World Federalists
*   A member of Students for a Democratic Society
*   A member of the Socialist Workers Party
*   A spokesman for the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs

The report was prepared as a Letterhead Memorandum with fourteen
copies for possible dissemination by the FBI to other Executive
Branch agencies. Copies were disseminated to military intelligence

This informative memorandum to advise of status of Departmental review of FBI files concerning Martin Luther King, Jr., and related matters.

You will recall that, commencing 12/6/75, personnel of the Civil Rights Division reviewed portions of our files concerning King and related matters. The last date such review was conducted in 1975 was on 12/19/75. On 2/9/76, Criminal Section Chief Robert A. Murphy resumed review of the King file. He worked on this for less than four hours on that day and was to return the morning of 2/10/76 but had not returned as of the dictation of this memorandum at 3:00 p.m., 2/10/76.

Murphy had been reviewing the King file to the exclusion of other files of interest. The King file is 94 sections in size and, as of 2/9/76, only about 25 sections had been reviewed. On that date, Murphy told Supervisor J. T. Aldhizer that, when he resumed the review the next day, he wanted to start with the portion of the file commencing 1/1/68. This would be Section 77, and thus Murphy would be skipping approximately 50 sections or a little over half of the file.

Murphy has given no indication, and neither has there been an indication from any other Departmental source, as to the true status of the Department's overall review

ON FEBRUARY 23, 1976, A SOURCE OF THE OAKLAND RESIDENT

HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH ED MONTGOMERY, A

FROM A THIRD PARTY ASKING HIM TO CALL LEWIS IN WASHINGTON AS
HE WANTED ADVERSE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE FBI. MONTGOMERY CALLED

MONTGOMERY MADE THE COMMENT THAT HE THOUGHT THIS WAS A TERRIBLE WAY TO ATTEMPT TO GET FACTS. SAC BATES SUGGESTED TO HIM IF HE FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT IT, HE SHOULD CONSIDER WRITING AN ARTICLE FOR THE EXAMINER AS TO THE APPROACH MADE TO HIM BY THE COMMITTEE. MONTGOMERY RETIRED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, BUT IS STILL CLOSE TO THE EXAMINER.

He is willingbetter to Vergara and instruct him to deriver the papers to a person who would be designated in his letter. He would make such a letter available to the FBI for delivery to Vergara.

Garcia advised that he has had no contact with Vergara since his departure from Cuba.

If feasible, it is requested that your Agency take the necessary steps, possibly through the Spanish Government or through the Swiss Embassy in Havana, to obtain Garcia's papers since they could conceivably contain intelligence and/or propaganda data of interest to the United States Government. If you desire, we would be glad to have Garcia write a personal letter to Vergara which would be made available to your Agency. If Garcia's papers are obtained, they will be reviewed by our Miami Office and pertinent data contained therein will be made available to interested agencies of the United States Government

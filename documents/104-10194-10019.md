SECRECY AGREEMENT

1. I. _RICHARDSON, JACQUES_
   _DALLAS L. LAUNTER_, understand that by virtue of my duties in
   the CIA I may be the recipient of information and
   intelligence which concerns the present and future security of the United States
   and which belongs to the United States. This information and intelligence,
   together with the methods of collecting and handling it, are classified
   according to standards set in the State, War, and Navy Departments. I have
   read and understand the provisions of the Act of Congress of June 15, 1917
   (Espionage Act), as amended, concerning the disclosure of information relating
   to the National Defense and I am familiar with the penalties provided for
   violation thereof.

2. I agree that I do not now, nor shall I ever possess any right, interest,
   title or claim in or to any of the information or intelligence or the methods of
   collecting or handling of it which has come or shall come to my attention by
   virtue of my connection with the CIA, but shall always
   recognize the property right of the United States of America in and to such
   matters.

3. I do solemnly swear that I will never divulge, publish nor reveal either
   by word, conduct, or by any other means such classified information, intelligence
   or knowledge, except in the performance of my official duties and in accordance
   with the laws of the United States, unless specifically authorized in writing in
   each case by the CIA.

4. I understand that no change in my assignment or employment will relieve
   me of my obligation under this oath and that the provisions of this oath will
   remain binding upon me even after the termination of my services with the United
   States.

5. I understand that my employment by the CIA is
   conditioned upon my understanding of and strict compliance with "Security
   Regulations," and the appendices thereto.

During the period under review, Subject managed to gain unlimited employment as a senior executive of an unnamed government publication as a time of economic slowdom when jobs were not easy to get. He did this without help from Headquarters or on the Station. Such an achievement is an attribute to subject's fluency in French, his ability to write, his general scientific know-how and his good business sense. Career hold of salary therefore is now paid by this company. In converting to part-time employment, a major adjustment, Subject's contribution to the sensitive operations in the MIRIKSH and Terrier fields against which he is targeted temporarily decreased somewhat. Subject continued thereafter, to maintain contact with three local scientists and initiated contact with three others. He also continues to search for new leads to personalities in the priority areas assigned to him. Subject has the ability to call on local scientists or technicians of just about any nationality with the possible exception of former citizens. He has used this now-unique potential well.

Subject has had occasional difficulty switching from "professional" or intellectual subjects in his endeavors, some of further personalities or access prospects to now Co-commissioned endeavors necessary -- don't.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

The station submitted comments on subject officer recently in crit- 16549 (8 April 1971), to which we can add that subject has, largely on his own merits, acquired a solid and potentially highly useful cover employment. However, this new employment will demand a very substantial amount of time and energy from subject, and the unanswer- able question at the moment relates to his availability for Organiza- tional tasks. We shall need additional time and careful working with this officer to determine the amount, since the fiscal outlay from the Organization to support his continued stay in Paris is still quite

as to the development of human material. His efforts in these areas were in the field of procuring and making operational contacts possible for him to more sharply-define Subject's operational standings at Subject’s requirements. Thus, his very real achievements are not by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to be copious. It could, however, further improve the reliability of the leads provided the station and make more of an effort to "digest" the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function, he has repeatedly requested much a responsibility. He is careful with operational expenses and has exercised good security.

During the period under review, additional efforts have been made to make full use of Subject’s potential and integrate him further in the work of the station components with which he works. He is a particularly valuable asset for the station programs directed against the local [

substantial. In a word, is it worth for ? We do not yet know, although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report form, this writer would have preferred an "A" rating for specific duty number only, Subject may ultimately deserve an "A", but it is hoped not misunderstood at the present time. However, I believe the overall rating would more properly have been in the higher range of the "B" category, rather than "C". But it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer, who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will reveal to what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on behalf of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely and will be commenting upon it subsequently as we gain experience and knowledge.

The comments of the rating offloor were limited to the period from October 1969 to March 1970. During this ported Subject uns integrated in a rou team assigned to the local sar and Commercial Starget. Subject's recent activity has bean very productive indeed. Subject weed the excellent petential given to him by his cover to skillfully spot and ascens necen agent candidates. As Subject's operational situation in Paris precludes making recrutement, the most promising of these candidates was placed in contact with a Station officer during sosial events. Subject organized. At the same time, Subject continued his efforts to develop personal and professional, relations with a major Minimum target enabled him to obtain instant. Subject also managed to establish contact with two other minimum representatives of interest. This, in one ense, required almost six months to accomplish yia a combina tion of patience, skill and determination. Subject is an experienced officer. He is cost conscious and practices good security. The Station has no other asses with the necessary scientific and editorial know-how, fluent French and Local knowledge to replace Subject. In view of this and the recent progress made by Subject in response to very specific requirements and his willingness to try to establish personal and, hopefully, secial relations with access prospects and minimum targets, the Station recently recommended that Subject's cover be reinforced by full-time employment with.

from the Organization. His continued presence at this Station definitely appears to be warranted for a further period to reach more definite conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat longer period than that reflected by this Report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to greater case officer direction and that his self-undertaken somewhat more aggressive efforts to expand his re[ ] is starting to find their way in immediate proximity to the primary Station targets. This officer is now bringing many talents to bear on his operational activity; he has thereby distant Branch, a solid and ample liable cover, and a vast web of assets in the local community. Nonetheless, it will require additional opportunity to analyze those contacts in depth, select those which appear to be reasonably viable, and pursue them actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimination from further development, for whatever reason.

In sum, in spite of the recognized and commendable improvement in this officer’s performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 3 would more properly have been a “P”, and that the overall rating, to this point, would more accurately be set at a level between “P” and “S”, probably closer to the former than the latter.

This reviewing comment had been seen by the officers who prepared the Fitness Report.

# SECTION C

NARRAIVE COMMENTS

The assignment of this employee to the field under non-official cover was designed to compensate for the loss of an employee in an official cover slot which was cut from the Section's CONOP allotment of personnel positions.

During the reporting period this employee has accomplished with success the convincing establishment of his cover in a complex milieu, and has been accepted as legitimate by his professional colleagues, the persons whom he meets under cover, and the French authorities. It should be noted that his ability to assume his cover has been largely the result of his own efforts over a period of years to acquire and maintain a familiarity with the general scientific field.

During the reporting period he has developed a wide circle of contacts in the scientific and journalistic milieu and applies a long background in a variety of assignments in support to the determination and assessment of operational potential among these contacts. At the same time his cover organization, in which only four persons are witting of his actual status, has shown itself to be more than satisfied with his performance of his cover duties.

This employee requires a minimum of detailed operational supervision; it is necessary in specific cases only to indicate the operational or informational objectives.

From the point of view of administrative support, his attention to detail and meticulousness reduces the problems of his support by the Station to a minimum.

This employee uses the French language continuously, and his facility is such as to permit him to handle himself fluently in a broad range of complex technical subjects. As he has in addition undertaken specialized French language training to develop this capability further. His operational reporting is excellent both with regard to clarity and pertinence.

In the immediate future he will be assigned case work, for the most part in fields where it will complement, and be complemented by, his independent operational activities and cover work.

# SECTION C

SECRET
(When Filled In)
NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, it applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the period under review, Subject managed to gain full-time employment as a senior executive of an HBSPRITE government subsidized scientific publication at a time of economic slowdown when jobs were not easy to get. He did this without help from Headquarters or the Station. Such an achievement is a tribute to Subject's fluency in French, his ability to write, his general scientific know-how and his good buisness sense. Over half of his salary therefore is now paid by this company. In converting to full-time employment, a major adjustment, Subject's contribution to the Station operations in the MHHARSH and TPFAST fields against which he is targetted temporarily decreased somewhat. Subject continued, however, to maintain contact with three local MHHARSH officials and initiated contact with three others. He also continued to search for new leads to personalities in the priority areas assigned to him. Subject has the capability to call on local scientists or technicians of just about any nationality with the possible exception of TPFAST citizens. Ho has used this near- unique potential well.

Subject has had occasional difficulty switching from "professional" or intellectual subjects in his development of MHHARSH personalities or access prospects to more down-to-earth interests necessary --con't

3. COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

The Station submitted comments on Subject officer recently in OFPT-16549 (8 April 1971), to which we should add that Subject has, largely on his own merits, acquired a solid and potentially highly useful cover employment. However, this new employment will demand a very substantial amount of time and energy from Subject, and the unanswerable question at the moment relates to his availability for Organizational tasks. We shall need additional time and careful working with this officer to determine the answer, since the fiscal outlay from the Organization to support his continued stay in Paris is still quite

to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore
more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts
than in that of more than short-range operational development.
Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to
attempt recruitments. Thus, his very real achievements are not
by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to
be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity
of the leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to
"digest" the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful
with operational expenses and has exercised good security.

During the period under review, additional efforts have been
made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him
further in the work of the station component with which he works.
He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs
directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

Section D (continued)

substantial. In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,
although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred
an "S" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately
deserve an "O", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the "P" category, rather than "S",
but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a
frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will reveal to
what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on be-
half of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely
and will be commenting upon it subsequently as we gain experience
and knowledge.

*   I planned, developed and exploited, and modified a non-official cover in order to mask our operational activity, and integrated these into the broader ranging overall activities of a major field Station.
*   I managed the non-official cover activity of viable professional/commercial cover organizations. The tasks included many business and production aspects as well as management of the firm's (unwitting/ personnel in the field and from the home office.
*   I assisted other Stations and Bases, upon their request, in spotting-assessment activities, in local search and surveillance of targets, and in recruitment.

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

The comments of the rating officer are limited to the period from October 1969 to March 1970 during which he worked with Subject. The previous rating officer has added his comments to allow coverage of the total indicated period from April 1969 to March 1970. During this period Subject was integrated in a new team assigned to the local SST and Commercial target. Subject's recent activity has been very productive indeed. Subject used the excellent potential given to him by his cover to skillfully spot and assess access agent candidates. As Subject's operational situation in Paris precludes making recruitment, the most promising of these candidates was placed in contact with a Station officer during social events Subject organized. At the same time, Subject continued his efforts to develop personal rela- tionship with several MARSHers. The beginning of personal, as opposed to purely professional, relations with a major MARSH target enabled him to obtain insight into the target's beliefs and personality which was the best the Station had to date. Subject also managed to establish contact with two other MHARSH representatives of interest. This, in one case, required almost six months to accomplish via a combina- tion of patience, skill and determination. Subject is an experienced officer, lie is cost conscious and practices good security. The Station has no other asset with the necessary scientific and editorial know-how, fluent French and local knowledge to replace Subject. In view of this and the recent progress made by Subject la response to very specific requirements and his willingness to try to establish per- sonal and, hopefully, social relations with access prospects and MHARSH targets, the Station recently recommended that he be extended in Paris, At the same tire, Station recommended that Subject's cover be reinforced by full-time employment with Subject's current HOLADY part-time employer.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As previous Station correspondence and fitness reports will reflect, this officer has been the subject of varying evaluations and projections in recent years. In fairness to him, however, it is equally true that an officer under non-official cover reflects, in the level and quality of his performance, the amount and type of guidance, direction and push he receives from the responsible inside case officer. Making allowances for these variables, this officer's past record has not been impressive; however, it is also correct to note that he has improved sub- stantially during the latter part of the period under review, and that is the Station can work out some fiscal arrangement which will reduce the heavy financial input

Section D3 continued

from the Organization, his continued presence at this Station definitely appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat longer period than that reflected by this report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity to the primary Station targets. This officer does bring many talents to bear on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent French, a solid and exploitable cover, and a vast range of contacts in the local community. Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue them actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina- tion from further development, for whatever reason.

In sum, in spite of the recognized and commendable improvement in this officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would more properly have been a "P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately be set at a level between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than the latter.

This reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared the Fitness Report.

During this reporting period subject had very steadily increased the tempo of his activities and contacts. Many agent prospects have been screened and contacts were established with people of interest to several elements of the Station. Subject is particularly thorough and outstanding on specific investigations where he utilized cover in a skillful and imaginative way. He has improved in terms of people development but in this respect he is still best with people in a professionally related context rather than a contrived social context. As mentioned in the previous report subject's cover assignment does not allow him to make recruitments. Subject has a high degree of cost consciousness and does not exercise any supervisory responsibilities.

Since the last reporting period subject's efforts were directed by the Station toward the spotting, developing and assessing WOLADY S&T agent candidates in tempo of recruitment and inclusion in the Station's S&T spotting network.

Subject has done thorough and at times imaginative spade work in this field despite the fact that the mission was not as successful as anticipated. Recent progress however would indicate that the next reporting period would be more productive.

Subject continues to respond to ad-hoc specific assignments in an exemplary manner.

Because of the nature of his cover assignment Subject is not authorized to make recruitments.

Subject has a high degree of cost consciousness. He does not exercise any supervisory responsibilities under his cover assignment.

ADDENDUM, Form 45 (Fitness Report), for period March 67-March 68.

Section D

As the individual being rated, I would like to add some remarks to those prepared by the rating officer.

The assignment I have includes managerial responsibilities which (a) are essential to the continued existence and security of the cover mechanism as a vehicle for operational exploitation, and (b) are not necessarily visible to those "on the inside."

In the case of (a), I must engage in a constant orchestration of the cover and the facilities it offers. This means maintaining a managerial equilibrium to insure that cover work will not become, of itself, so demanding that it negates the cover's utility to the CS. In effect, the top officers and middle managers of the cover corporation [who are not cleared and witting] have to be satisfied that their demands are met (or cannot be), or else manipulated in order to neutralize or reject their demands. After all, the cover position is to them a legitimate, normal, workaday post in their firm. What work is done at their bidding, it follows, must be accomplished according to the high standards of thoroughness and accuracy which they have set.

In the case of (b) -- which derives from (a) -- and can prove to be so demanding that the needs of the CS could no longer be served, the incumbent is required to manage a span of human contacts at several levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance its value to the CS. This means planning, directing and managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of technical correspondents, as well as meetings and negotiations to improve the [cover firm's) relations with similarly widespread individuals at the levels of editor-in-chief, publisher, corporate vice-president, president, and chairman of the board. These levels are scattered not only through industry, but have their analogs as well in government, higher education, and professional societies.

Having previously managed both a CS base and the principal denied-areas operating component of a major field Station, I can report quite honestly that my present managerial responsibilities exceed the former -- despite the apparent lack of "supervisory responsibilities" in my present position.

3. It is difficult to place in the proper perspective the contribution of this senior staff agent to Paris station operations. On the one hand, Subject has established superb cover in the scientific and technical field which should have afforded him virtually unlimited access to persons of interest to us, both Soviet and potential access agents. In evaluating the manner in which the employee set up and managed this cover, I would tend to agree with his comments to the fitness report on the managerial demands on him, although these comments are somewhat overdrawn. The principal difficulty has been the time it has taken to relate the cover potential to the specific operational requirements of the Station. We have not received from CAS as many leads and assessment reports to persons of operational interest in the S&T field as we think he could have produced. It may be that the earlier listing of the project (viewed as a regional undertaking) contributed to this.

Recently we have noted significant improvement in that we have received responses to requests we have made for assessment and development of potential access agents within a cover context. We hope, therefore, that this last year of CASIM’s stay will be the most productive ever. It is unfortunate that the cover must end because of the cover company’s decisions over which we had no control.

Subject continues to maintain a secure effective cover mechanism. In this reporting period the whole thrust and objectives of this cover facility have been changed from pursuit of targets designated by Headquarters at international conferences to pursuit of the local Soviet presence. This has caused a major readjustment and Subject is now beginning to produce the type of leads that help the Station achieve its local operational objectives.

Subject continues to show a well organised methodical approach to his cover and operational tasks.

Subject is cost conscience.

## COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I rarely see the written product of this employee's efforts and know little of his work except as I am informed of it by his supervisor in the Station. I have the impression, however, that the employee is responding to his supervisor's guidance and is not by any means simply drifting along paths indicated by his cover work, which can be a temptation when an employee has, as is true in this case, rather limited contact with his colleagues who work under official cover on the same target. I thus concur in the evaluation on the basis of limited knowledge.

if required to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Subject has done an outstanding job in creating a Jury mechanism which enables direct access to an important target group. This job was performed carefully, securely, intolligently and imaginatively. Subject is an experienced, highly capable senior professional officer in every sense of the term. He is a thoroughly organized self-disciplined person who can operate effectively outside a normal Station complex. He has the supply mind required to learn highly technical cover tasks and perform these in a skilled manner. He organizes the performance of these cover duties in such a manner as to extract the most operational mileage. Subject has spotted, assessed, developed, and in special cases recruited. He is extremely articulate, and an excellent writer. Despite his deep cover status, he submits timely finished operational and information reports. His management, administration, and record keeping of both his cover and operational duties is excellent.

Although Subject has had long experience in supervisory capacities, his present singleton cover status does not require supervisory duties.

SECTION C. NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section ; to provide basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties described, if applicable. During the reporting period this employee as a staff agent has continued the solidification of his cover and the expansion of his operational activity within his cover to a point where he represents as deeply buried a staff officer as can be found in anyone with his past organizational background. From the point of view of the host country authorities he appears to be completely legitimate. From the more important point of view of his targets, he also apparently has been accepted, and not through a lack of opportunity for scrutiny, for what he claims to be. He thus represents for KUBARK an asset who has not only solid status and access cover, but also the demonstrated capability for exploiting his cover for specifio and aggressive operational undertakings. As has been stated in past fitness reports, his present capability directly and openly to approach operational targets through the vehicle of his cover is the result of his own efforts, in which he has devoted a tremendous amount of work not only to establish and enhance the foundations of the cover, which requires a considerable amount of work for the cover company, but to devise and exploit ways and means by which the cover activity may be applied directly to operational tasks and programs. In addition to operational activity in his country of assignment, he has also been used in Hqs-directed activity in other countries, usually involving direct contact with target individuals, and in addition he has contributed greatly to the acquisition of operational information for the use of Hqs components in their overall approach to Soviet scientific and technical targets.

It would be difficult to fault this employee with respect to energy, professional skills, and mental capacity. He is a keen student of his operational environment and very skillful in analyzing the possibilities it offers for application toward operational objectives. He shows considerable resourcefulness in devising logical and credible (continued)

Since the Reviewing Officer in the field has not indicated his views on this Fitness Report, I would like to make a comment of my own. Without wishing to detract from anything the Supervisor has said about Subject's performance, I feel obliged to note that the ratings given him in this report are higher than those given, for example, to any Branch Chief in this Division, and, as such, are inconsistent with the grading pattern of the Division as a whole.

## SECTION C continued

approaches to operational problems and personalities, and expends considerable effort in maintaining a level of specialized knowledge sufficient to backstop his cover and to ensure the maximum exploitation of his contacts with target organizations and individuals. His command of spoken, written, and technical French is excellent.

From the point of view of supervision, this employee in his present position requires guidance only insofar as to identify specific targets and for him to protect himself in situations where he does not have, by virtue of his not having access to official files, specialized information. Otherwise, he requires no supervision other than the periodic provision of policy and operational directives.

This employee has always been conscious and punctillious in his preparation of operational and administrative reports, including financial accountings, and his reporting in general, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing the risks inherent in the lack of access to classified storage, leaves nothing to be desired.

Other than the funds for operational activities, this employee currently has no responsibility for the programming and use of personnel, space, equipment, and funds.

With respect to dedication to his job, this employee has practically speaking single-handedly built his present cover/operational position despite a number of negative factors inherent to his situation such as relative isolation, meager opportunity for contact with his professional group, and expensive area of assignment, and an exposed cover situation where the necessity for living cover is compounded by the necessity of avoiding mistakes which might jeopardize cover. His dedication to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge ofthis assignment, and his willingness to continue on in it, deserve particular mention, particularly since he would perhaps Justifiably feel that his present assignment may leave him outside the mainstream of competitive organization progression.

This employee's health and family situations leave nothing to be desired, as his proven mobility in the execution of operational assignments attests.

It should further be noted that with respect to the problem endemic to deep-cover assignments of allocation of time between cover work and operational activity, this employee comes very close to the happy norm of making cover work complement operational work, and making operational work contribute where possible to the enhancement of cover.

While this employee's assignment to date has essentially been a one-man show, it is recommended that serious consideration be given to expanding the operational complex which he has created in order to capitalize on his experience, the work he has put in to date, and his own management capabilities.

*(Section B) - No special recognition of Subject's "Outstanding" overall performance is being requested at this time.

This employee combines the relatively rare combination of a senior and broadly experienced intelligence officer under working cover providing both long-term status in his country of residence (and in Europe in general) and access for a variety of operational functions, including spotting, assessing, contact with Soviet bloc nationals, of specific interest, investigative measures, assessment in depth of ostensibly cover-company hired persons, and attendance at a broad range of national and international specialized meetings. Development of the capability operationally to exploit his cover has been the achievement of the employee himself. In so doing he has at the same time achieved genuine acceptance by his cover company associates (most of whom are unwitting) and his colleagues in his cover profession and related professions.

In undertaking operational tasks this employee has consistently shown initiative imagination, security consciousness, and application of both operational and substantive background to the problem at hand. He has put a conscious effort into improving his already excellent command of the French language, and his grasp of a variety of specialized scientific and technical fields has been achieved basically as a result of his own efforts.

His management of operational reporting, finances, and the administrative problems connected with his cover status has been exemplary.

It should be noted that during the reporting period, this employee has not had the benefit at all times of specific pinpointed operational direction. As of the end of the reporting period, Headquarters assumed control of his activities against specific Soviet targets on a Europe-wide basis.

SECTION C

SECRET
NARRATIVE COMMENTS

The assignment of this employee to the field under non-official cover was designed to compensate for the loss of an employee in an official cover slot which was cut from the Station's ODACID allotment of personnel positions.

During the reporting period this employee has accomplished with success the convincing establishment of his cover in a complex milieu, and has been accepted as legitimate by his professional colleagues, the persons whom he meets under cover, and the French authorities. It should be noted that his ability to assume his cover has been largely the result of his own efforts over a period of years to acquire and maintain a familiarity with the general scientific field.

During the reporting period he has developed a wide circle of contacts in the scientific and journalistic fields and applies a long background in a variety of assignments in KUDOVE to the determination and assessment of operational potential among these contacts. At the same time his cover organization, in which only four persons are witting of his actual status, has shown itself to be more than satisfied with his performance of his cover duties...

This employee requires a minimum of detailed operational supervision; it is necessary in specific cases only to indicate the operational or informational objectives.

From the point of view of administrative support, his attention to detail and meticulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station to a minimum.

This employee uses the French language continuously, and his facility is such as to permit him to handle himself excellently in a broad range of complex technical subjects. He has in addition undertaken specialized French language training to develop this capability further. His operational reporting is excellent both with regard to clarity and pertinence.

In the immediate future he will be assigned case work, for the most part in fields where it will complement, and be complemented by, his in-dependent operational activities and cover work.

Describe, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personel actions.

In most respects, this officer is one of the best I have known in this agency. He has a broad and deep knowledge of his target area, as well as of his "host" country; an excellent and proven degree of operational "know-how"; the ability to write and speak lucidly and effectively and with apparent ease; and a very high degree of motivation and devotion to duty. He can be expected to continue his dynamic and imaginative pursuit of a most difficult target. It is my opinion that this officer has great potential and is ready for increased responsibilities which would involve the promotion for which he has been recommended. As for training, a good managerial course might help to bring into even sharper focus his many talents.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Subject is an exceedingly well-equipped operations officer. He is mature, intelligent, has a thorough background in operations in his area and the ability to grow in his job. His operational planning and execution is usually impeccable. He has the loyalty of his subordinates and the respect of his equals and supervisors. He is particularly effective in dealing in the liaison field where his good sense and disinterest in "fighting the problem" produces a maximum of cooperation and good will. If he has any minor fault as a supervisor, it is not in impatience with his subordinates, as reflected in previous evaluations, but in an occasional unwillingness to say no to them.

SECTION D. SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

DIRECTIONS: Take into account here everything you know about the individual....productivity, conduct in the job, pertinent personal characteristics or habits, special defects or talents....and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Subject has excellent natural equipment for employment in this organization in terms of his intelligence and natural apptitudes. Additionally, he brings a great deal of area knowledge and language ability to his present assignment. During the period covered by this report he has displayed great industry and devotion to duty in a variety of circumstances and achieved notable results in production and in the creation of both short and long-term assets for his unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat too businesslike in many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless. This, however, is a quality which he does not permit to intrude upon the necessities of his operational work although it often shows in office relationships.

SECTION D. SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

DIRECTIONS: Take into account here everything you know about the individual...productivity, conduct in the job, pertinent personal characteristics or habits, special defects or talents....and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

1. DEFINITELY UNSUITABLE - HE SHOULD BE SEPARATED

2. OF DOUBTFUL SUITABILITY...WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED HIM IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW

3. A BARELY ACCEPTABLE EMPLOYEE...BELOW AVERAGE OUT WITH NO WEAKNESSES SUFFICIENTLY OUTSTANDING TO WARRANT HIS SEPARATION

4. OF THE SAME SUITABILITY AS MOST PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE ORGANIZATION

5. A FINE EMPLOYEE - HAS SOME OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS

6. AN UNUSUALLY STRONG PERSON IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION

7. EXCELLED BY ONLY A FEW IN SUITABILITY FOR WORK IN THE ORGANIZATION

The 'Applies To' category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating.

During this period Mr. Richardson: was promoted from Deputy Fraich Chief to Branch Chief, in recognition of his extremely good performance. Hot enough time has elapsed to be able to evaluate him fully on all aspects of his new position. However, his handling of the Branch has been unusually good from a management point of view and there is every reason to believe that in the planning and direction of operational activities the same high standard will prevail.

11. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THIS PERSON'S PERFORMANCE ON THE MAJOR DUTIES LISTED UNDER ITEM 7 ABOVE. As Deputy Branch Chief, Mr. Richardson has performed his duties, taken as a whole, in a superior manner. His timely and efficient preparation of intelligence annexes, logistic and fiscal requirements and reports has been particularly outstanding. During three to four months of the past year, Mr. Richardson has acted as Branch Chief. The review of Branch operations under Mr. Richardson's direction, during the writer's absence, indicated his complete competence in supervising Branch activities. His supervision of the planning and preparation for approval of basic plans and projects of the seven (7) desk chiefs has been superior. Mr. Richardson also participated in the planning and dispatch of a difficult operational mission, acting in the capacity of Senior Case Officer. On this mission his liaison with representatives of one of the Military Services was conducted in a manner which enhanced cooperation between that Service and this Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS/CSB

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-15 -
Jacques G. RICHARDSON

REFERENCE: Your memorandum dated 8 October 1958

1. The SR Division and the Chief of Station, Tokyo (FJTT-1950, attached) recommend the promotion of Jacques G. Richardson to GS-15.

2. Mr. Richardson was last promoted 16 January 1955. On 17 February 1955 he arrived in Tokyo to serve as the senior SR officer in the FE field area, his present assignment. In this position he has continued to display qualities of leadership, initiative, imagination and thoroughness which resulted in his rapid rise in the Agency.

3. The very facts of Mr. Richardson's youth in relation to his responsibilities and the fact that promotion to his present level has been rapid, caused the Division and the Chief of Station, Tokyo to hold until this time a recommendation for his promotion which was submitted in June 1957. Most careful consideration has convinced us that not only is Mr. Richardson deserving of the recommended promotion, but his elevation to the higher grade will be in the best interest of the Career Service and meet definite Division requirements for a senior officer at the GS-15 level.

The slot and job which he now occupies, Chief, Soviet Branch, is, of course, adequate to accommodate such a promotion.

2. operational performance has been outstanding and notably versatile during this period. He has engaged primarily in liaison and has been personally effective in terms of results achieved almost daily, in terms of reports, operational data, and joint enterprise; while, overall, he has established enduring professional relationships from which the organization as a whole should benefit for some time to come. In addition, owing in large part to unique personal talents, linguistic and otherwise, has handled a number of unilateral cases most effectively. In the office, too, as well as in face-to-face operational situations; has been outstanding. He has a flair for and a facility with the written word as evidenced by the amount of general and particular correspondence which he has initiated, and he knows the organizational "drill" intimately and from way back. Thus, I feel that he is qualified for the recommended promotion by ability and experience in both the internal and external aspects of the profession.

3. Relative to the more personal characteristics involved in the term managerial ability, judgments are necessarily more subjective but here, too, I consider to be qualified in maturity, in judgment, and in experience. He would most certainly be a supervisor who could perform all the chores or handle all the situations which he would be calling upon subordinates to take care of, in itself, the beginning of any good supervisory relationship. In actual fact, he has had considerable experience in this regard already and the principal shortcoming I have noticed is a tendency to "carry" others by an extension of his own industry. is not without his difficulties in the area of personal relationships.

Secretary, CS Career Service Board

1. After reviewing GS-14 employees assigned to the SR Division, I wish to again recommend the promotion of Jacques Richardson, Chief, Soviet Branch, Tokyo to GS-15. I concur also in the attached recommendation for the promotion of Paul Haines prepared by the Chief of Base, Berlin.

2. The Chief of Station, Tokyo and I recommended Mr. Richardson's promotion in December 1953. This earlier recommendation presented the personal qualities of Mr. Richardson. I wish simply to point out at this time that since early 1954, Mr. Richardson has more than fully discharged responsibilities at the GS-15 level. I believe that it is definitely time to elevate him to the level at which he has been performing more than satisfactorily for over 5 years.

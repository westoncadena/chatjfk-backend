OCCURRENCE: In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing the mission, Sam Gold suggested that they not resort to firearms, but that if he could be furnished with some type of potent pill that could be placed in Castro's food or drink. Sam indicated that he has a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official, who had been receiving back payments from the gambling interests who still had access to Castro, and was in a financial bind. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD was consulted and assigned Dr. Raymond Treichler to develop a pill that had the elements of rapid solubility, high lethal content, and little-or-no-traceability. Six of these items were produced and after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, Three pills were ultimately turned over to Sam for the mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn was briefed on the ultimate use of the pills.

OCCURRENCE:
The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to sponsor the religious activity of Father Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700 Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that the current thinking contemplated figures more on the order of 3,000." Mr. Barnes replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as 3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

CARD 1 of 2

DR. EDWARD GUNN, Chief, Operations Division, Office of Medical Services, has a notation that on 16 August 1960, he received a box of Cuban cigars to be treated with a lethal material. (21). He understood them to be CASTRO'S favorite brand. (21). GUNN's notes show that within the next month he contacted Ray Treichler, of TSD, (Sept. 6, 1960) and gave him the box of cigars (21). Treichler recalls "that he did contaminate a full box of 50 cigars with Botulinum Toxin, a virulent poison," (21) which would kill the intended victim upon merely putting it in the mouth. Treichler's notes showed delivery of the box on February 13, 1961, although they do not indicate to whom. (22).

The memorandum of April 25, 1967 which introduces the IG's Report on assassination plotting in relation to FIDEL CASTRO indicates that the only written records which served as a basis for the IG Report were: Notes of William Harvey; Records of Dr. Edward Gunn (Office of Medical Services; and, brief records of Ray Treichler (of TSD). Some operational files were also used.

For the most part, the Inspector General's office relied upon information given to us orally by people who's memories are fogged by time. (1)

"We interviewed everyone whom we could identify as likely to be knowledgeable, with the exceptions of MR. DULLES and GENERAL CABELL." (2)

A complete list of the interviewees is attached to the IG Report at Tab A. "If there are significant innaccuracies in the Report they are most likely to occur in faulty ordering of the sequence of events." (2).

Bissell stated at the meeting that he had recently "been chewed out in the cabinet room of the White House by both the President and the Attorney General for, as he put it, sitting on his ass and not doing anything about getting rid of Castro and the Castro regime. His orders to both and to me to plan an operation to accomplish that end. Halpern testified that no limitations were put on the term "get rid of". Nothing was forbidden (8). The meeting involved only general discussions and not tactics.

OCCURRENCE:

DESMOND FITZGERALD originated a scheme to assassinate CASTRO: "The idea was to taken an unusually spectacular sea shell that would be certain to catch CASTRO's eye, load it with an explosive trigger to blow when the shell was lifted, and submerge it in an area where CASTRO often went skin diving." (77)
FITZGERALD explored this idea at several sessions with SAM HALPERN and BRUCE CHEEVER, but it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. (77).
DISCOVERY LEADS: Note: There is no indication that FITZGERALD told anyone above him in the CIA hierarchy of this plan.

When HARVEY was asked if the multipurpose-use-included-assassination, he stated-that-i-f he had ever been directly ordered to perform an assassination, he would have considered the people spotted by Q.J.Win as possibilities. (50) He testified that before someone would have actually been approached to carry out that operation, there would have been a long period of assessment and cross checks. As far as he knew, the particular spotting mechanism never went that far. So far as HARVEY could recall K.J.Win was used only once in connection with an opera-Lion in the Congo, which was not an assassination operation. (51)

(57) Harvey clarified that the wording of the memo probably meant that consideration should be given to the question of how, whether and under what circumstances the DCI should be officially advised of his program, "I want to make it clear that this in no way means he should be advised. He should not be advised, he should never be advised, he should always be advised." (59).

Harvey testified that his notes didnot cite assassination or assassination capability as an objective of project Zrriffle. However, assassination was a contemplated purpose of the project. If an agent had been recruited for assassination he would have been recruited under the cover of obtaining code and cipher materials. (49)

In response to the increasing requirements for the operational procurement of foreign code and cipher materials, division D in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as a developmental activity. During the same period requirements from NSA became more refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the OOA category. (exhibit 1, page 1 - 2)

> TOP SECRET

The EXECUTIVE ACTION program authorized by BISSELL and run by WILLIAM HARVEY "came to be known as ZRRIFLE. Its principal asset was an agent, QJWIN, who had been recruited earlier by ARNOLD SILVER for use in a special operation in the Congo (the assassination of PATRICE LUMUMBA) to be run by JUSTIN O'DONNELL (O'DONNELL made a survey of the scene, decided he wanted no part in that assassination attempt, and asked to be released -- which BISSELL granted.)" (38)

NOTE: In the copy of the I.G. REPORT provided to the Committee, which was, according to EARMAN's cover memorandum the ribbon copy, which was the only text of the report in existence, phrase in the above paragraph "(the assassination of PATRICE LUMUMBA)" was crossed out. S. BRECKENRIDGE indicated to the Committee that this phrase was crossed out by RICHARD HELMS when he read the report. Why?

OCCURRENCE: It was agreed that Harvey was to work towards reaching a stage in the interrogation of *Pedro Roig*, the Cuban economic official who *defected to Mexico*, where he can be surfaced to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food. This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against the unarmed people of Cardenas. "The-Cuban-source to story-need not-await-your-determination of the true cause of the Cardenas demonstration."

According to Mrs. Virginia Leitao de Cunha, she contacted Ruz and obtained Ruz agreement to provide intelligence on the Cuban political leadership and to work against the Cuban Communist regime, "short of engaging in activity which might result in direct personal harm to her brothers Raul and Fidel."

Some operational files were also used.

For the most part, the Inspector General's office relied upon information given to us orally by people who's memories are fogged by time. [^1]

"We interviewed everyone whom we could identify as likely to be knowledgeable, with the exceptions of MR. DULLES and GENERAL CABELL." [^2]

A complete list of the interviewees is attached to the IG Report at Tab A. "If there are significant innaccuracies in the Report they are most likely to occur in faulty ordering of the sequence of events." [^2].

## CAPITOL HILL EXPERIENCE:

January - July, 1971--Glenn M. Anderson of California
Joined staff as secretary to the administrative assistant, Harry Anderson. Stayed here only six months because I did not find the work challenging and was losing my skills because I was not using them enough. Salary was approximately $6,800 to $7,400.

September, 1971 - September, 1975--Office of the Legislative Counsel
Was member of the secretarial pool taking a great deal of shorthand and typing from 25-30 attorneys. This job was extremely demanding but was also excellent experience. I left a bit reluctantly to go to school.

December, 1975 - November, 1976--Richard F. Vander Veen of Michigan
Became member of this staff on a part-time basis. My duties involved typing letters composed by entire staff except administrative assistant. Here again, as in the Counsel, I had responsibility for a great deal of typing, but less shorthand than before. I learned how to work two kinds of automatic typewriters and was responsible for using them for large-volume mailings. Left staff after this seat turned over after election. Salary approximately $6,500 for a twenty hour week.

## PRIOR TO HILL EXPERIENCE:

March, 1970 - January, 1971--Shering Pharmaceutical Company
Secretary for two product managers, John Moser and Toby Madison. Had many different responsibilities: filing, typing, shorthand, telephone calling and answering, making reservations for overseas trips and in-country trips, and greating business clients. Enjoyed this job greatly. Salary approximately $6,400.

Personal Information: Date of birth--October 26, 1950--Houston, Texas
Marital Status--Married, no children
Health--Excellent

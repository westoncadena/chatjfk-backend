# INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall determine to his own satisfaction that as appointment would be in conformance with the Civil Service Act, applicable civil-service rules, the War Service Regulations, and acts of Congress pertaining to appointment.

This form should be checked for hold up of active pension, purchase of office, suits in connection with any record of recent discharge or arrest, promises to observe provisions regarding personal integrity, and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of appointee with the applicant whose appointment was authorized. The appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application and/or other pertinent papers. The personal appearance may be checked against the medical record. The appointee may also be questioned on his personal history for agreement with his previous statements.

(2) Age. If discrepancy exists between the date of birth and that on application and if definite age limits have been established for the position, it should be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for appointment.

(3) Citizenship. The responsibility for observance of appropriation acts prohibiting or restricting the employment of aliens lies with the appointing officer. The Civil Service Commission indicates on applications showing foreign birth that citizenship has been verified. The appointing officer should verify citizenship at the list of eligibles or the letter of authority from the Commission makes the appointment subject to proof of citizenship, or if the application shows foreign birth but does not indicate on its face that citizenship has been proved. If the answer to question 5 of this form shows foreign birth and the application shows birth in the United States, the case should be referred to the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family. Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that whenever there are already two or more members of the family in the classified service, no other member of such family is eligible for appointment in that service. Minors do not establish a different family merely by living at an address different from that of the parents. Doubtful cases involving more than three members of a family, mail permanent evidence should be reported to the Civil Service Commission or its duly authorized representatives for decision. Under War Service Regulations the members provision does not apply to temporary appointments for one year or less.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ECONOMIC COOPERATION ADMINISTRATION
SPECIAL MISSION TO AUSTRIA

November 19, 1948

Mr. Averell Harriman,
U. S. Special Representative,
Economic Cooperation Administration,
Hotel Talleyrand,
Paris, France.

Dear Averell:

On the point of departure from Vienna, I want to record with you my appreciation of the services rendered me in this Mission over the last few weeks by Mr. Howard Hunt, Information Officer, temporarily assigned here from your staff.

Hunt has not only carried the duties and responsibilities of Information Officer, pending appointment of Mr. Wilson to that post, but he has, additionally, carried a large load for me in connection with the Ross murder incident. He has acted as a personal aide, to all intents and purposes, at a time when, understaffed as this Mission is, we were faced with a concentration of vitally important work in connection with our normal Mission operations.

I think Hunt has shown a broad-gauged grasp of what ERP is, what ECA is, and what Information work in behalf of both should be. Besides this, he is the right kind of person to have in this great ECA undertaking. I hope you will be able to keep him and to give him opportunities to express his abilities fully.

Sincerely,

Westmore Willcox
Westmore Willcox
Chief of Special Mission

TO: All C. I. A. Personnel

FROM: Personnel Director

SUBJECT: PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE

1.  The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate data on all personnel. The new system will aid in implementing Agency policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel with desired education and experience for vacancies which may occur. It is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics for planning and management purposes.

2.  The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those factors in which the Agency is interested. Although the information is, in a large measure, already reflected in previous forms submitted by you, it is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves to bring your education and qualifications record up to date.

3.  Your cooperation is requested in completing the questionnaire as thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative Officer within the time allotted.

7 March 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR: E. Howard Hunt, DDP/EUR/CA

SUBJECT: Service Computation Date

In your memo of 24 February 1969 to the Director of Personnel you requested a classification of your Service Computation Date, since various records had indicated three different dates. The date should be 7 September 1944.

This date reflects the following service:

Economic Cooperation Administration-

17 May 1948 - 08 June 1948 22 days

Foreign Service-

09 June 1948 - 19 February 1949 08 mo., 11 days

U.S. Naval Reserve-

19 August 1940 - 13 October 1942 02 yr., 1 mo., 25 days

U.S. Army-

06 October 1943 - 08 January 1946 02 yr., 3 mo., 3 days

Agency (Staff and Contract)-

08 November 1949 to Present

Total non-Agency time amounts to 5 years, 2 months and 1 day. When this time is subtracted from your Agency EOD date the result is 7 September 1944.

The confusion has resulted from conflicting dates arrived at in previous attempts at classification.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

This office is charged with arriving at SCD's for leave purposes. Prior to your retirement the Retirement Operations Branch vill obtain records from the Civil Service Commission verifying that service which is creditable for retirement purposes.

In this regard let me point out that the date which we have Just verified contains a period of service that is potentially creditable for retirement. Your ailitary records show an en- listment in the Army as 6 October 1943. However the form later states active duty from 22 November 1943 to 8 January 1946. If you have any questions regarding the computation please call me on 27165. Questions regarding creditable service for retireasnt purposes can be referred to Murray Benthall on X3257.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT : Howard E. Hunt, GS-15, Employco
Number 013842, DOB: October 1918;
EUR/CA; Career; Service Designa-
tion: D.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 22 June 1968 - 31 March 19689

MONTIIS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7

OVER-ALL RATING : Strong

1. Mr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA In July 1968. His performance in this position has been consistently Strong.

2. From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational concepts which has been underway in the Division since the termination over the past two years of many long established projects. He has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of European realities and evolutions. While concerned with the role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific action in the field. In both these areas he has shown a power of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views, and persistance and vigor in helping get action underway.

3. There are three primary areas in which Mr. Hunt has played an important role in the Division's business. The first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches and Stations in the conduct of on-going CA action, and the modification and relocation of certain activities of concern to the Senior Staff and other divisions. He has brought to this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equities, an excellent awareness of realities in the field and of the practical limits imposed by the field priorities, manpower, and the requirements of security.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 177

4. Secondly, Mr. Hunt has carried with him from SAS
   a continuing participation in the work of that staff in its
   two aspects: the countering of Soviet political action and
   a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party
   operations. He has contributed to the definition of these
   interests and worked closely with the Branches in identi-
   fying opportunities. Neither of these areas are of a nature
   that has made for prompt common understanding between Head-
   quarters and the field. Mr. Hunt's TDY's have been of
   major assistance in furthering this understanding.

5. Thirdly, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly im-
   portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,
   studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked
   to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra-
   tion in January. Intimately coupled with this is direct
   support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-
   ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses
   and studies which have derived from that participation.

6. In all these duties, Mr. Hunt's performance has
   reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination. He has had,
   to his credit, the advantage of excellent give and take
   with the Division's branches and a sound knowledge of branch
   people and capacities. He has drawn with equal effective-
   ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other
   divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of
   the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting
   business done at lHeadquarters.

7. In summary, Mr. Hunt's has been the performance of
   a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a
   period which has somewhat changed the nature of the CA
   officer's duties within the Division.

Dear Mr. Hunts:

It is the practice of the Organization to follow up with former employees six months after their retirement. We hope by such inquiry to obtain information on what our retirees are doing and where they are located, invite suggestions for improving the retirement program and to learn if the Organization might be of some assistance on any post-retirement matters.

We should like very much to hear from you on the above points and on any other topics you think would be useful to us.

For your convenience in replying, we have enclosed a sheet somewhat akin to a form on which we have listed those standard items of information we'd like to have on every retiree. The remainder of the sheet, including the reverse side, is for your comments and suggestions. We shall be most appreciative of your fullest response to this inquiry.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Carroll A. Duchay
Personnel Officer

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

Career Profile

From 1949 to the present I have been a career official of the Central Intelligency Agency. My foreign assignments have been in Europe, Latin America and the Far East where my duties involved the collection, evaluation, and reporting of high priority intelligence in the national interest. This intelligence information related to the economic, political, social and military aspects of nations and regions where I was located. During two crisis periods I was a senior member of special task forces organized to confront the crises, and took part in White House conferences. At other times I have served as a regional trouble-shooter.

Abroad I have dealt and negotiated with senior officials including Presidents of foreign nations and members of their Cabinets.

In Washington I have represented CIA at high levels of our government including the Psychological Strategy Board, Operations Coordinating Board and Interdepartmental Groups chaired by the Assistant Secretary of State. I have had extensive responsibilities for the development and review of large-scale budgets, and for their successful presentat.on.

I have also had broad experience in dealing with key non- governmental figures in the United States and abroad, including major corporate and industrial personalities at the highest level.

REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS:

Although I would not differ from the evaluative comment on this officer, I would be inclined to rate his over-all performance as highly PROFICIENT rather than Strong, in view of his broad.experience and grade. This officer has had a series of personal and taxing problems, beyond his control, which have tended to dull his cutting edge just enough to be noticeable.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of manager supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Subject has performed in a manner quite consistent with his long and broad experience in many aspects of the craft of intelligence. His senior grade, his special expertise in the field of propaganda and publication and his very high intellect have contributed to the division's operations in the public media field a sharp focus, an economical concentration of money and effort and a consequently heightened impact. In the WUHUSTLER project, Subject vindicated his faith in a moribund clandestine asset by demonstrating, after about a year and a half under his personal direction, that it is one of the most effective activities of its kind. Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from visionary and diffuse direction and from poor case officer-agent rapport. Subject's personal handling of this operation is marked by excellent rapport and the project prospers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himself enthusiastically welcomes.

Subject's supervisory responsibility has extended over two secretaries, from one to two professional staffers under official cover and three professional career employees under unofficial cover. The fairness and precision of his management has patently won their respect and inspired their performance.

Indicate significant strengths of weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping is precer perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position., Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Männer of performance of managerial or sugary duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Hunt continued to direct the propaganda activities of the DO Division in a superior professional manner until 12 October 1964, when he was incapacitated by illness. On his return from sick leave on 7 December, he was detailed to the Office of the DD/P and officially transferred to that office on 28 February 1965. DO Division can only view this transfer with considerable regret.

Mr. Hunt, by virtue of his personal background, has a unique flair and competence in the propaganda field. Over and above, but complementary to these special skills, his extensive experience in the CS, his sound judgment, high and creative intellect and other commendable personal qualities contributed significantly to the successful prosecution of DO's efforts in the media field. These same atributes, attest, in my judgment, to his suitability for employment as a Station Chief or in any other position requiring broad knowledge of and skill in the CS business. He is very cost conscious and an effective supervisor. He enjoys the respect of all personnel under his supervision, official and non-official, as well as that of all his co-workers in the Division and Station.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT : Howard E. Hunt, GS-15, Employee
Number 013842, DOB: October 1918;
EUR/CA; Career; Servico Designa-
tion: D.

PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 22 June 1968 - 31 March 19609

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7

OVER-ALL RATING : Strong

1. Mr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA in
   July 1968. His performance in this position has been con-
   sistently Strong.

2. From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's
   Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial
   contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational
   concepts which has been underway in the Division since the
   termination over the past two years of many long established
   projects. He has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of
   European realities and evolutions. While concerned with the
   role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially
   operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the
   recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific
   action in the field. In both these areas he has shown a power
   of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views,
   and persistance and vigor in helping get action underway.

3. There are three primary areas in which Mr. Hunt has
   played an important role in the Division's business, The
   first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches
   and Stations in the conduct of on-going CA action, and the
   modification and relocation of certain activities of concern
   to the Senior Staff and other divisions. He has brought to
   this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-
   ties, an excellent awareness of realities in the field and of
   the practical limits imposed by the field priorities, manpower,
   and the requirements of security.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

SECRET

4. Secondly, Mr. Hunt has carried with him from SAS a continuing participation in the work of that staff in its two aspects: the countering of Soviet political action and a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party operations. He has contributed to the definition of these interests and worked closely with the Branches in identifying opportunities. Neither of these areas are of a nature that has made for prompt common understanding between Headquarters and the field. Mr. Hunt's TDY's have been of major assistance in furthering this understanding.

5. Thirdly, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly important role in responding to requirements for memoranda, studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked to produce since the beginning of a new national Administration in January. Intimately coupled with this is direct support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's participation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses and studies which have derived from that participation.

6. In all these duties, Mr. Hunt's performance has reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination. He has had, to his credit, the advantage of excellent give and take with the Division's branches and a sound knowledge of branch people and capacities. He has drawn with equal effectiveness upon a broad range of personal associations in other divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting business done at Headquarters.

7. In summary, Mr. Hunt's has been the performance of a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a period which has somewhat changed the nature of the CA officer's duties within the Division.

REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS:

Although I would not differ from the evaluative comment on this officer, I would be inclined to rate his over-all performance as highly PROFICIENT rather than Strong, in view of his broad experience and grade. This officer has had a series of personal and taxing problems, beyond his control, which have tended to dull his cutting edge just enough to be noticeable.

Mr. Hunt is an officer with real ability, creative and managerial. During the period under review, he has done a great deal to tighten up the operation of his shop. The amorphous aspects of some projects he inherited have been eliminated or cut down to size. He has a pleasant and engaging personality and a broadly based background.

If there are any areas of weakness in his performance it is only because his potential is so considerable. For example, it is possible that the staff and planning aspects of his job could receive more attention although, admittedly, there is a large grey area between the responsibilities of the CA Staff and the responsibilities of DODS in this respect.

Mr. Howard Hunt
11:20 River Road
Potomac, Maryland 20854

Dear Howard:

I have taken so long in answering your letter of April 5th because of the careful consideration given to your request by all concerned, particularly as we have not had this problem before.

I am sorry to tell you that our answer is in the negative, although we have taken every approach we can think of to comply with your wishes. Very simply, the problem is as follows:

The statute states--

At the time of retirement, any married participant may elect to receive a reduced annuity and to provide for an annuity payable to his wife or her husband, commencing on the date following such participant's death... (emphasis added).

Our regulation on the subject repeats the language of the statute above and in addition states--

A participant may not change his election under this provision...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 221

We considered the possibly of a waiver of the regu-
tion but ran into another problem here. The act specifically
provides that the Director may proscribe rules and regulations
but continues with the language that, "such rules and regulations
here to become effective after approval by the chairman and
ranking minority members of the Armed Services Committees
of the House and Senate." The regulations as presently enacted
were specifically reviewed by those Committees and approved
in their present form.

Looking back into the legislative history of the act, we
believe it is clear that the Committees desired our act to con-
form as closely as possible to Civil Service retirement, which
definitely would not permit a change of election after retirement.
There does not appear to have been any administrative error or
misunderstanding at the time you retired and made your election,
therefore, we have been unable to find any basis for making the
change you request.

I think you know me well enough to agree that I like to
stay as flexible in the law as I possibly can, but this seems to
be one case where we are bound by specific provisions with no
leeway to meet the requests of individual employees.

Sincerely,

![signature]

11120 Rive-Road,
Potomac, Maryland 20854..
May 12, 1971.

The Honorable
Lawrence R Houston,
General Counsel,
The Central Intelligence Agency,
Washington, D. C. 20505.

Dear Larry:

I thoroughly appreciate the thought
and study you gave my problem, and while your find-
ings are disappointing to me, I must regard chos as
definitive.

Reflecting on the statute, however, I
find myself wondering whether such irrevocable limi-
tation on personal choice is, first, in the public
interest, and second in the interest of annuitants
whose porsonal circumstances and civil status are
subject to unanticipated change. This could be the
subject of an interesting class action challenge in
which, I imagine, more than a few annuitants would
be eager to join.

All that aside, I'm most grateful for
your efforts to help me once again.

Cordially,

Honsid

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Mr. E. Howard Hunt

1. On 21 June 1972 Mr. Robert Tegethoff, INR, Department of State, informed Mr. James Franklin, Chief, CCS/OCB, that the Department of State had received press inquiries in regard to Mr. E. Howard Hunt's service with the Department of State, INR had arranged for withholding any Department of State replies until CIA had been consulted. Mr. Hunt's cover record showed that he was in Integrated Department of State status in Mexico from 1950 urt11 1953 and in Montevideo from 1957 until 1960. He also had nominal domestic Department of State cover from 1966 until he retired in 1970. Upon retirement, Mr. Hunt was " opened up as a CIA employee back to EOD in November 1949.

2. In the absence of both Messrs. Osborn, Director of Security, and Geiss, Deputy Director, I discussed the State Department request with Mr. Leo Dunn, Acting Deputy Director of Security for Personnel Security. He concluded that everything considered, the Department should say that Mr. Hunt was assigned to the Department while in integrated status but, when pressed, not deny his basic CIA status. While trying to clear this line with the ADDP, Mr. Gelss called and at the end of our discussion, cautioned that any guidance to the Department of State in regard to Mr. Hunt should be cleared with the DCL

3. I then talked to Mr. Sam Halpern, EA/DDP, to determine the whereabouts of Mr. Meyer. He recommended that I taik to both Messrs. Meyer and Colby who were in the OPPB think tank.

OLUACI

4. As I was leaving my office, Mr. Tegerhoff called Mr. Franklin a second time to say that in the evening of 20 June 1972, Mr. John King, Department of State'a Press Office, and Mr. Joha Unumb of CLA had discussed press Inquiries in regard to Mr. Hurt which were made to the Department of State in the afternoon of 20 Jane 1972. These inquiries had particular reference to Mr. Hunt's Blography in WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA showing him as Department of State employee since 1968 and listing his office at the Department of State. Messrs. Unumb and King agreed the press should be laformed that he was not on the State Department's payroll during the period. Mr. Uaumb confirmed this arrangement when I called him and sald that he had added that Mr. Hurt retired in good standing from CIA in April 1970. I also cleared the proposed guidance with Mr. Ted Shackley, Chief, WH Division.

5. I then saw Messrs. Colby and Meyer, outlined the Department of State's request and our proposed reply that Mr. Hunt, during his Integrated service in Mexico and Montevideo, was assigned to the Department of State. This information would not be volunteered by the Department of State, and Mr. Hunt's basic status as a CIA employee would not be denied if raised by members of the press. Messrs. Colby axl Meyer agreed that this was the only feasible line to take. I then asked Mr. Colby whether additional clearance from the DCI was required. He replied that it was not, and that he would brief the DCI.

6. I informed Mr. Geiss of Messrs. Colby's and Meyer's decision and then called Mr. Tegerboff and provided him the agreed guidance.

Attachment to Fitness Report of Howard Hunt 31 March 63 - 31 March 64

## Section C (Continued)

Special mention should be made of Subject's objectivity and integrity in carrying out his responsibilities. These were best demonstrated when he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadcasting project, to establish which he and his subordinates had labored hard, immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable, practical obstacles precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential.

Subject'a professional background has attuned his constant attention to FI operational opportunities arising in the course of his current CA activities, a practice consistent with his habit of seeking maximum benefit for every dollar spent in time, effort or cash.

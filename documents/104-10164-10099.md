SUBJECT: POSSIBLE RELEASE OF CUBAN EXILE LEADER ORLANDO BOSCH

REFERENCE: WASHINGTON 173605

1. LEGALLY THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF CONVICTING BOSCH AND THE OTHERS BECAUSE THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED IN VENEZUELA AND THUS VENEZUELA HAS NO JURISDICTION IN THE CASE. SECONDLY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AGAINST BOSCH AND GROUP. THESE ARE THE OPINIONS OF A NUMBER OF STATION AGENTS AND CONTACTS INCLUDING VENEZUELAN LEGAL EXPERTS SUCH AS WKALIKE-1, WKDIET-6 AND WKSCARLET-Ù©.

2. WHILE HERNAN AND LUGO SUPPOSEDLY CONFESSED TO THE CRIME IN TRINIDAD, THEIR CONFESSIONS ARE NOT ADMISSABLE IN COURT AND THEY HAVE DECLINED TO REPEAT THEM FOR VENEZUELAN JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. THE EVIDENCE LINKING HERNAN AND LUGO TO POSADA COMES FROM TELEPHONE TAPS, WHICH ARE LIKEWISE INADMISSABLE, BOSCH'S CONNECTION WITH THE CASE COMES FROM. A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN LUGO AND POSADA IN WHICH THE NAME ORLANDO" IS MENTIONED. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS COULD MAKE A GOOD CASE THAT THE "ORLANDO WAS DISIP OFFICER ORLANDO GARCIA AND NOT ORLANDO BOSCH.

3. THE GOV COULD, OF COURSE, PUT PRESSURE ON THE COURT AND JUGGLE THE EVIDENCE TO GET A CONVICTION, BUT TO DO SO WOULD LEAVE IT OPEN FOR CRITICISM INTERNALLY AND REPRISALS FROM THE CUBAN EXILES, AND WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE DEFENO DANTS WOULD DIVULGE EMBARRASSING INFORMATION CONNECTING GOVERNMENT FIGURES TO BOSCH AND THE EXILES HE LED.

# EXCLUSIVE: Jailhouse Interview with Cuban terrorist Orlando Bosch

# AMERICA'S KILLER WATER

BY LAWRENCE WRIGHT

# "I am going to declare war"

It had been a long time since Dr. Orlando Bosch had talked to a reporter. He had been a fugitive for three years-ever since he boasted he was going "underground to direct the internationalization of the war" against his one-time comrade Fidel Castro. Sometimes, as he flew from one Latin American capital to another, he would forget what name he had decided to use and would begin fumbling among his four phony passports.

He had once been a practicing pediatrician, first in Cuba, then in Miami, but for more than 20 years now the tools of his real trade had been instruments of death-plastic explosives, rifles and bazookas. He led a group of Cuban exiles Implicated in some 150 bombings and some 50 murders in the last two years (New Times, October 29, 1976). His group had been linked to the car-bomb assassination of Chilean exile leader. Orlando Latelier in Washington, D.C., last September, and now he was under arrest In Caracas, Venezuela, charged with ordering the bombing of a Cuban commer. cial airliner last October 6, which killed 73 people. He is one of the most famous terrorists in the world.

A tall, heavy-set man with thick glasses, he was sitting in the sun in the Caracas prison when I walked up to him.

"Dr. Bosch?" I asked hesitantly.

"Yes?" he replied.

I introduced myself as a reporter from New York. Ho squinted as ho carefully looked me over.

"How did you get in here?" he asked susplulously.

I told him I had called his lawyer two weeks hefure and been told to vome down to Venestusta. Ily the time I arrived, his lawyer had gine on vacation and I couldn't reach him. I was in despair, I'd flown 3,000 miles for nothing.

By Blake Fleetwood

Orlando Bosch is in a Venezuelan jail, charged with ordering the bombing of a Cuban plane in which 73 people died. In an exclusive interview, he talks about his years as a terrorist, his secret alliances with Latin American governments and his plans to get even with the "traitors" who put him in jall

It seemed that it would be impossible to see Bosch. I knew that Joanne Omang of the Washington Post had spent weeks in Caracas trying to see Bosch and hadn't been successful. In desperation I had called another lawyer, who surprised me with a simple suggestion. "Tomorrow is visiting day," he said. "Be there at 8 a.m. and maybe you can get in."

At eight the next morning, I showed up at the prison gates and saw two lines of visitors waiting to enter the prison. On the left were about 300 women burdened down with baskets of fruit, pies, cakes and fresh linen for their imprisoned menfolk. To the right stood the four male visitors to the prison. In a tew minutes the line started to move and I followed along. I passed a table where someone asked me for my cÃ©dula. Although I understand some Spanish, this was not a word I knew. Everyone else! handed him what looked like an I.D. card, so I took out my passport. He took it and gave me a small plastic stub. One of the geards, who spoke a rough, courr try Spanish that was dificult to understand, told me to put down my briefcase and ushered me into email bathroom where I was frisked. Then my briefcase was quickly searched and headed back to me. I followed the other four men: through two barred gatea. And suddenly I realized I was in the prison-at liberty, to find Busch among the kalinging pilioners. I erxed one of the more respectabia looking prisoner's where I could finil Orlando Bosch.

"You're in the wrong place altogether. I'll take you to him." And he did-through endless corridors and ceil blocks, We ended up in a sundit courtyard in a coullon of the prison reserved: for special prisoners. He pointed to a man 20 fest away, as if he didn't want to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

get too close to the most famous killer in all of South America. "Over the at that table. That's him."

I told Bosch that not only hadn't they asked me whom I was going to see, but that they had somehow missed the compact tape recorder in my briefcase. Bosch, as it turned out, was anxious to talk to a foreign reporter, saying that the Venezuelan government had prevented other interviews. For six hours, over the din of homemade drums in a nearby courtyard, he poured out his story.

"Fidel Castro and I were born in Cuba the same month 50 years ago. We both came from fairly prosperous middle-class families. We both ended up at the University of Havana in the late 1940s. I was in medical school and president of the student council, and Castro was a delegate to the student council from the law school. Although we had our differences, we worked together often and were both elected to our positions from the same political party, which was very much in the center between the right and left. It's not like today when all Latin American universities are dominated by Marxists. We were both very anticommunist and anti-Batista and very nationalistic."

Bosch left Cuba in 1952 for two years of internship in pediatrics at Toledo Hospital in Ohio. "When I finished in 1954, I returned to my hometown of Santa Clara and set up a practice as a pediatrician. But the tyranny of the Batista dictatorship made me join up with Castro again."

"The Batista dictatorship was choking us. I became the leader of the July 26th Movement in my province and we won the fight. I was appointed to the government as a minister of communication. But even as the war was ending, we were having problems with the Communists. They were taking over everything. I complained, I fought against it, but there was nothing I could do. At the time, I still had faith in Castro and his revolution. But then it got too bad, and after a month I resigned from the government. That's when I started conspiring against Castro."

Bosch told me about the group of anti-Castro guerrillas he had led in the Escambray mountains in Cuba in 1960. Castro, Bosch says, sentenced him to death. After running out of supplies, he and his followers fled to Florida, where they found a benefactor in the CIA. At one point, the agency had up to 6.000 Cuban exiles on its payroll.

Bosch interrupted himself and took a to his cell, a small sixty-eight foot room lined with Spanish tile wallpaper. A small Sony television sat on a shelf in the corner, and there were fresh "designer" sheets on the bed. Bosch introduced his cellmate, Luis Posada, who is also being held in connection with the plane bombing. Posada pulled out a box of Havana cigars and offered me one: "America may have an embargo against Cuban cigars, but we don't."

Bosch and Posada had worked together during the heyday of CIA-sponsored anti-Castro activities in the early sixties, including bombing missions against Cuban sugar mills and gunboat attacks against Castro's fishing boats. But, in 1963, after the Cuban missile crisis and the subsequent reduction of anti-Castro activities by the Kennedy administration, Bosch realized that the CIA was no longer wholeheartedly committed to his cause. "I felt betrayed by the Kennedy administration and by the CLA. They held out a dream to us and then let us down."

### "The Dominican government let me stay in the country.and organize 'actions.'! wasn't going to church every day. We were conspiring there. Planning bombings and killings"

His own militancy had only increased. An exile group he led claimed credit for 11 bombing attacks against Cuban territory; six times Bosch was arrested for violating U.S. neutrality laws

Finally, on September 16, 1968, ho was caught in the act of firing a makeshift bazooka into the hull of a Polish ship docked in Miami.

Most of this testimony against Bosch at his subsequent trial came from Ricardo Morales Navarrete. Morales is a man of many hats-terrorist, informant, hit man, mercenary and cop. He had been an agent in Castro's secret police, a CIA operative, a paid informant for the FBI, an agent provocateur, an anti-Castro terrorist. Today he is a top Venezuelan secret-police official.

Bosch and Morales met in Miami in 1968. Morales, acting on instructions from the FBI, supplied Bosch with dynamite and C-4 explosives for blowing up ships. He also fixed and put in firing condition the bazooka Bosch used against the Polish ship. Morales testified that Bosch had said he was sorry that the bomb he planted in a ship called the Osaka Maru went off in Tampa Bay, because "the thing that he wanted was for that ship to blow up outside in the middle of the sea because he was anxious to see all the Japs swimming and screaming 'Wee, wee, wee!' while the ship was sinking."

Bosch was sentenced to ten years in federal prison, but was freed on parole on November 1, 1972.

During his imprisonment, Bosch's wife had left him. His voice broke as he told me about it. "This fight cost me my family and my five kids. They love me and are very proud of their daddy, but I was in jail for five years when they really needed me. They were 13, 11, 10, 8 and 5. They grew up without me. You know how society is there, all the drugs and crime. I wasn't a very good husband."

Bosch has always lived simply, wearing a succession of old baggy suits, often staying at the slum houses of his supporters. "If I had stayed in Miami and practiced medicine I would have made many millions by now. But I could not do that while my country was in agony. I have paid very much for the struggle, very expensively, but that's the only way I know. Sometimes a man has a higher duty than to his children. Sometimes a man has a duty to his homeland. That's the duty I feel."

Soon after his release from prison, Bosch's sense of duty took an ominous new turn. Detente between the United States and Communist countries was chilling to the militant Cuban exiles. A new exile group formed the National Front for the Liberation of Cuba, or FLNC, said to be modeled after the Palestinian terrorists. Soon an FLNC death list began to circulate around Little Havana, and then one exile leader on that list, Jose Elias de la Torriente, was assassinated. Ricardo Morales narrowly escaped death, when a bomb exploded under the front seat of his car. The Miami homicide squad wanted to talk to Bosch, but he had disappeared.

A few months later, in a clandestine interview with the Miami News, Bosch praised the Torriente assassination as "a good lesson to the exile community, so that no one else will now come forth with phony theories to fool and rob the people." Nevertheless, he disclaimed direct responsibility, and said he had gone underground because he had coincidentally violated his parole by traveling to New Jersey around the time

New York free-lance writer Blake Fleetwood last wrote for New Times on mercury poisoning in Canada.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

of the assassination. But, he added, "I went underground to direct the internationalization of the war. I thought that the action people (terrorists) should get out of the U.S. and operate from different bases throughout Central and South America." In the next 18 months, four of the ten people on the FLNC list were killed, and a fifth had his legs blown off.

During that period, Bosch was traveling widely in the Caribbean. (Did he ever slip back into the U.S.? Rosch laughed. "If I have to go to the United States, I go.") His main goal was to forge alliances with friendly governments in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Venezucia--all countries with powerful Cuban exile communities.

Bosch claims that he made his first pact with the Venezuelan government in 1974. He had entered Venezuela from the Dominican Republic in June of that year, using a false Dominican passport in the name of Pedro Penya. "We set off a bomb in front of the Panamanian embassy in Caracas. We chose the 10th of October because that is the date the liberation of Cuba was announced in 1898. We did it because the Torrijos dictator (Panama's president) announced that he was going to Havana, and he did, and he kissed Castro. As the beginning the authorities blamed some Panamanian general who was in exile here. About two weeks later a Communist Cuban official was invited to speak at the Venezuelan-Cuban friendship club. I infiltrated into the audience and before the guy could speak the whole thing blew up. We had to do it. We didn't want to hurt anyone, but we just didn't want the guy to talk."

"I continued conspiring all that fall, raising money and planning bombings and other actions. But about the middle of November I was arrested by the DISIF (the Venezuelan secret political police). They denied to the press that I was in the country or even under arrest. [The U.S. knew of Bosch's detention, but passed up the opportunity to extradite him.) Then I made my first formal agreement with the Venezuelan government. I dealt with Rivas Vasquez and Orlando Garcia (second and third in command of the DISIF].

"I promised that no more actions against Castro's friends would be taken In Caracas, and they promised me in the name of President Carlos Andres Porez that no high official of the Cuban regime would be allowed into Venezuela."

Rusch was then relented. He flew to Curavau, where he met with Cluillermo Novo and other Cuban caite leaders

from the U.S."From Curacao," he d. "Novo and I flew to Chile and mak of effort there." Bosch lived in Chile from December 1974 to Deveniber 1975, where he had another family with a Chilean woman. According to press reports, he lived as a guest of the government in a government apartment. "I passed several times from Chile to Argentina. We tried to shoot some Cuban dipkÄ±mats in the middle of 1975 and we set off a bomb at the Mexican embassy in Buenos Aires. We made good contacts there with members of the triple-A party (a right-wing extremist group). Because of the contacts we made down there, we set up the murder of two Cuban diplomats. That was part of the agreement I had with them. On August 9th last year, I had a call from our people down there. They said, 'You read the papers today?'" Bosch then made a slashing motion from

Carlos Rivero Collade, a former Juban exile leader who has returned to Cuba, has written that Bosch received special instruction in assassination and personal attacks during his year in Chile from the Chilean National Intelligence Department. "The purpose behind the training was to have Bosch assassinate Andres Pascal Allende, nephew of the slain Chilean president," he wrote.

According to former Costa Rican Foreign Minister Gonzalo Facio, Bosch arrived in his country with the Andres Pascal assassination assignment given to him by the Chilean junta. Using a Chilean passport, a Chilean driver's license and other Chilean documents in the name of Hector D'Avanzo Cintolessi, Bosch entered the country from Nicara- gua where, according to Facio, he had met with "close aides of President Anastasio Somoza." On the basis of intelligence reports Bosch was detained in 5 Costa Rica and, while being held, according to Facio, "he told interrogators he intended to kill Secretary of State Kissinger, who was due to arrive here soon thereafter." Bosch admitted to me that he had been in Costa Rica, but would not acknowledge any role in the alleged assassination plots.

"After leaving Costa Rica I went to live in Santa Domingo until August of 1976. I had a number of good friends there and we planned many actions.

"The Dominican government let me stay in the country and organize actions. I wasn't going to church every day. We were conspiring there. Planning bombings and killings... People were coming in and going out. I was plotting with them: Secretly, of course."

Bosca's plotting culminated in a secret meeting of the top terrorist laud ars of the hemisphere in the Dominican Republic. "The story of CORU (Coordination of the United Revolutionary -Organizations) is true," he told me, "Thara was a meeting in the Bonzo mountains of 20 men representing all different (Cuban exile) activist organizations. It was a meeting of all the military and poisteal directors with revolutionary Iniplica tlons. It was a great meeting. Everything was planned there.

The top men from Alpha 66 (Now.

"At last we had all the Cuban rev- olutionary fighters and leaders together, after 17 years. We decided to upscale the action after that. We wanted to beat the guy (Castro) or at least make his life impossible. I told them that we couldn't just keep bombing an embassy here and a police station there. We had to start taking more serious actions-hijacking." (According to a Cuban exile newspaper, one of the resolutions that came out of that meeting was a vow "to begin attacking Castro's planes in the air."â)

"I accepted the leadership of CORU because I wanted to set everything up on an organized basis. We were tired of being frustrated and not accomplishing everything that we wanted to do." Bosch brought the other leaders up-to-date on the kind of help they could expect in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Chile. Then the group dispersed. In the 11 months since that meeting, Bosch boasts, CORU has been responsible for over 50 bombings in Miami, New York, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico and Argentina. (Bosch refused to admit any personal involvement in bombings within the United States; police sources say the leaders had agreed not to take credit for actions within the U.S. because the FBI was putting too much heat on them.)

After the Bonao meeting the Dominican government called Bosch in and told him he was "too hot" and would have to leave the country.

"I told them how cowardly they were and how scared of Castro they had become, but to no avail. I went back to Costa Rica, and Oduber (the president), to make up for the damage they had done when they arrested me (for the alleged Kissinger assassination plot), gave me three passports. One from Peru and two others from Costa Rica. Then I went back to Nicaragua, where I began getting phone calls from Orlando Garcia (security adviser to Venezuelan President Perez and a top officer in the DISIP). Garcia told me that he had been jogging with the president-he exercises with the president every day-and that Perez had told him to invite me to Venezuela to make a deal. I didn't pay any attention, but after he called me three times and sent me a visa, I came.

"At the airport I was met by Garcia and Ricardo Morales (the man whose testimony had sent Bosch to jail, and who had by that time become a high official in the DISIP). They took me to a luxurious government apartment in the Anauco Hilton and we made a deal. I agreed that there would not be any actions in Venezuela, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. In exchange they would let me live in Venezuela under an assumed name and organize other terrorists' actions elsewhere. They wanted me to include Grenada and Guyana.

"I said emphatically, no, I agreed to include Costa Rica, but I didn't want to include Panama because it is a (leftist) dictatorship. And I didn't want to include Guyana. We had already attacked Guyana. The CORU already blew up the Guyana embassy in Trinidad.

"Finally they said, 'All right. We'll just include the three countries. You can do what you want in all the others.' They offered me use of weapons, but I refused, saying that we already had all that we could use. They offered me bodyguards from the DISIP (the secret police), but I didn't need those either. They gave me an identification card from the DISIP which I took-I think it was in the name of Sucre. I was always traveling around the countryside with a great many bodyguards and lots of weapons.

Bosch's secret pact with Venezuela "was going perfectly well. In fact, I was supposed to meet with President Perez on October 10, but then the plane blew up on the 6th and all the trouble started"

ons. If I got stopped, I would just show my secret-police card and I wouldn't have any problems."

boeage 2

Up till that point, Bosch told me, "the pact (with Venezuela) was going perfectly well. In fact, I was supposed to meet with President Perez on October 10, but then the plane blew up on the 6th and all the trouble started. I had a lot of conversations with Garcia. He lived in the Anauco Hilton also. I asked him what should I do and he said, "Nothing is going to happen, just stay quiet. Don't worry, everything is going to be nice."

"Then one day he calls me up and says, 'The president wants you to stay here (at the police headquarters). No problem. You'll be safe.' But I have been under 'protective custody' for seven months now, and the president has said on television that I was a member of the CIA and trying to destabilize his government.'"

Bosch claims that Orlando Garcia has told him to "sit tight, everything will be all right. We will let you go as soon as the publicity blows over." But Bosch is not sure he believes him, and is getting very impatient. He spoke to me with extreme bitterness about "the betrayal of the Cuban people" by the Venezuelans who had so recently befriended him. He is even willing to entertain charges that Venezuela set him up from the day he was invited to live there. Could his old archenemy Morales have cleverly gotten even in this way?

"Some of my friends said that they called me back deliberately to betray me. I don't know. It is possible."

In any case, Bosch has decided to resume the offensive. "When I was brought to the court the last time, reporters crowded around me, but I didn't say anything. They asked me if I had a DIS IP card. I denied it, but I can't keep quiet anymore.

So Bosch had found in Venezuela a seemingly secure base for his terrorist activities. Then, within a two-week period last fall, two terrorist incidents put the Cuban exiles on the front pages and landed Bosch in jail. The first was the September 21 assassination in Washington, D.C., of Chilean exile leader Orlando Letelier, whose car blew up as he drove past the Chilean embassy in Sheridan Circle. Cuban exiles were immediately suspected of carrying out the crime as hit men for the Chilean junta.

The second was the October 6 explosion in flight of a Cuban airline jet shortly after takeoff from Barbados. All 73 persons aboard were killed. The next day, two Cuban exiles, Hernan Ricardo and Freddy Lugo, were arrested in Trinidad. According to secret court documents obtained by *New Times*, they confessed to planting a bomb in the plane and implicated Orlando Bosch (see the wall by (President) Perez. We're going to accuse him of betraying us. A traitor to democracy, a traitor to the Cubans, and also a traitor to the American cause. I am going to declare war on the Venezuelan government in the name of the Cuban cause. I don't care that I am sitting in jail. Perez is a traitor. He was making a pact with Castro at the same time that he was making a pact with us.

"If they want to put me on trial, they will also have to accuse the minister of the Interior, the DISIP director and the president. These people conspired with me. They should be put in jail as well.

"Did you see the Viasa (Venezuelan Airline) office blown up in Puerto Rico yesterday? My Cubans blew it up, but somebody is going to take credit for it."

# "The bus has left with the dogs": How they blew up the Cuban plane

The following account of the bombing of the Cubana Airline jet is based on secret Venezuelan court documents. Most of the information comes from the confessions, since repudiated, of the men charged with the crime.

Herman Ricardo, 22, had been working at the private detective office of Luis Posada in Caracas for about a year when, on September 10, 1976, Posada introduced him to a "Mr. Panyagua." Posada assigned Ricardo to help. Mr. Panyagua" get around, as lie was a stranger in the country. After a few days of helping "Mr. Panyagua... Ricardo realized that he was really Orlando Bosch, the maximunt lender Fof the Cuban people.

The bomb made a big bulge in Ricardo's pocket and he was very nervous.

It took only a few minutes in the toilet, but then Ricardo found he couldn't get out. He panicked avad started banging on the door. The stewardess tried to open the door from. the outside, bute couldn't. She called one of the pilots from the cockpit who kicked at it three times with his foot. Finally the door opened and Ricardo stumbled out. By the time he got back to his seat he was drenched in sweat and appeared very nervous. For the rest of the flight Ricardo held a newspaper in front of his face.

They got off the plane in Barbados, collected their luggage, and made their way to the Hotel Village. At one point in the cab ride Ricardo told the driver to stop, jumped out and looked up at a passing, plane. He was very agitated and nervous.

here, no matter where."

They caught a plane to Trinidad, leaving their bags in the hotel room in Barbados. On the plane kicardo buried his head in his hands and said to Lugo, "Shit, Lugo! I'm desperate and I feel like crying. I have never killed anyone before."

At the Holiday Inn in Trinidad, Ricardo called Bosch, who told him, "Friend, we have to see each other in Caracas. You never should explode a bomb while a plane is in the air."

Meanwhile, the Barbados cab driver, struck by Ricardo's erratic behavior, had contacted the police. They tracked Ricardo and Lugo to Trinidad. In their hotel room the police? found two phone books containing many different aldresses, including those of Orlando Bosch, Luis Posada and Joseph Leo, an FBI legal attache in the United States embassy in Caracas.

The Trinidad police separated Lugo and Ricardo and during the questioning that followed over the next few days the police threatened to send them back to Cuba unless they talked they both confessed. Ricardo told Police Chief Denis Elliott Randwar that he had planted the bomb on the airplane. He also said, "I am a membe of a secret organization, the CORU or

organization is Orlando Bosch.

Ricardo added that he was a CIA agent of the grade B-1" and that he had been recruited in 1971. He said that he had received training in the manufacturing of bombs, the handling of firearms and photography by the CIA

On the night of October 5. Ricardo, Bosch and Freddy Lugo, 25, met at a Cuban exile meeting. At midnight that same day, Ricardo and Lugo flew to Trinidad aboard a Pan American flight. They stayed overnight and the next morning inquired about Cubana Airline flight 455, stopping in Barbados en route to Cuba. The clerk told thein that the Cuban plane had been delayed, but that there was another flight to Barbados leaving Immediately, Ricardo protestual, but had trouble getting his message across Since his English was not very good. Standing behind Ricardo in line were a fow members of Cuba's championship fencing team, who were returning home after an international tour. One of the fencers, also booked Con Cubana flight 455, translated for Ricardo. He says that he doesn't want to go on an earlier flight. He only wants to travel on Cubana 455 and he's willing to wait until it's ready to go."

Lugo and Ricardo each chocked 'e bag, sind Lugo carried with hlin a dark Allluntur shoulder bag with two onneras and a tube of Colgate toothpasto in it. With 16 Cuban fencurs, 6 inediual students from South America, 5 Koreans and 45 other, mustly Cuban, passengers and crow, Largo and Ricardo finally got on the plane. About half-way through the 20-minute Night, Ricardo got up to gu to the bathroom to plant the explosive.

Lugo described the scene ten minutes later as follows. The people in the streets were very agitated and pointing up to the sky, saying that asend a plane had fallen. Ricardo said that we were in big trouble because we had traveled on false passports. At the hotel Ricardo told me to take the bags up to the room while he registered in a false name. He said lie was calling, as necesitas Venezuela for advice."

He had difficulty getting through. One call that he did get through was to his girlfriend, Marines Vegas. She testified that he gave her a a number and told her to get the following message to Luis or Gustavo:

Tell them I am in a desperate situation and that they should send someone quick. That this is a question of life or death and that the bus has left with the dogs. Tell them that I threw away the phone numbers

Ricardo got a phone call back from Caracas during which Lugo quotes him as saying, "What's happening, Luis? I have a lot of problems. I don't know what to do. The bug has fallen into the water. "Tell this to Panyagua (Rosch)

Just as ho put down the phono Kleandu saw someone staring at him and ran up to the room in a pasla, Lugo says Ricardo told him, "Let's get out uf hore right away. The man who atared at me in the lobby is a 0-2 (agent 'of Castro's searst pollue)."

"We took a cab to the dooks," 1.ugo said, "and Ricardo threw something in the water, 'Then he said, We should get the first plans nit of

Before a number of Trinidad policemen he drew a picture of bomb and described the plastic explosive that had been used. He said he kept the "pencil detonator in the tube of Colgate toothpaste, Differenti colored chemical pencils could trigger an explosion in 8 minutes, 45 minutes, 2 hours, 8 hours or 24 hours, the bald, He said he had been paid $25,000 1,000 to plant the bomb

On October 20, after signing hia confessions, Ricardo tried to kill himself by slashing his wrist whin razor, but he was taken to the hospital and survived.

This is just a message. There will be a couple of messages more."

I asked him if there was going to be a kidnapping attempt against Venezuelan diplomats. (An FBI informant reported a plan to kidnap the Venezuelan ambassador to the United Nations in March. The ambassador was informed and surrounded with extra security.) Bosch replied: "There are going to be a lot of things after I declare war. This is going to be a tremendous risk for me because I'll still be in jail. After the war declaration there are going to be a lot of bombings, a lot of kidnappings, a lot of shootings. We have to attack everything except their plane in the air. Their offices on land, yes."

And what about the spectacular crimes that put the Cuban exiles in the spotlight?

Cuban government officials have told recent American visitors that Orlando Bosch was enlisted and paid by the Chilean junta to carry out the Letelier assassination. Bosch, they claim, par-

## Bosch concedes that the Cuban exiles discussed Orlando Letelier. "Chilean officials told me many times when I lived there that they wanted him dead"

celed out the money to other members of CORU who actually blew up Leteller. Bosch coursedes that the Cuban exiles "discussed Orlando Letelier at [the Bonao) meeting, and the fact that (Letelier's) campaign [to discredit the junta abroad) was bothering some of our friends in Chile. Chilean officials told me many times vihan I lived there that they wanted his dead." But Bosch denied knowing anything about the Leteller assassination. "Even if I did know," he added, "I wouldn's tall anyone. I'm not a stool pigeon or an informer."

According to a confidentist intelligence report obtained by *New Times*, however, Beach was not sui raticent about the Latelier case when questioned by Venezuelan cuthorities shortly after his arrest. The report states that Rosch told Rivas Vesques, second in command of DISIP, that, while he had nothing to do with the Latelier assassination, "the Novo brothers are directly involved."

Quillermo end Ignacio Nave are among the most militant and activist Cuban exile leaders in the United States. They were arrested in 1964 for firing a bazooka at the United Nations while Che Guevara was speaking there, but charges were dropped because they were not read their rights before they confessed.

Guillermo Novo (or Bill, as he is known at the Chevrolet dealership in Union City, New Jersey, where he is a new-car sales manager) was sentenced to five years in jail in 1971 for possession of explosives. He served six months, and was given probation for five years. Under the: terms of his parole he was not allowed to leave New Jersey. But Bosch told me of two foreign trips Bill Novo took the first to Curacao and Chile, the second to Bonao. Bill Novo could be sent back to jail for these trips in violation of parole-which he denies making.

Bosch's story to Vasquez about the Novos' involvement in the Letelier murder correlated with a story that had been told to authorities by an FBI informant in Washington. (Contrary to reports in most American papers, no U.S. official has been allowed by the Venezuelan government to see Bosch.) On the basis of these two leads Eugene Propper, the Assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the Letelier investigation, has called about ten Cuban exile leaders before a-Washington grand jury. Bill Novo was called before the Letelier grand jury twice, and twice took the Fifth Amendment. The government has now begun offering limited immunity to some of the other Cuban exiles, hoping to force them to talk. Recently a friend of Bill Novo's was jailed after refusing to testify before the grand jury about Novo's travels to Curacao.

As for Bosch, his future is unclear. Venezuelan legal experts say the likelihood of convicting him in the airplane explosion case is not great. Ricardo and Lugo, the chief potential witnesses against him, have repudiated their confessions after being deported to Venezuela from Trinidad. In any case, confessions made in Trinidad are not admissible in Venezuelan courtrooms: The government has tapes of Ricardo's telephone calls to Venezuela, but these, too, are inadmissible, since they were not obtained legally. It is thus entirely possible ihai Bosch will be released.

If that happens, he will surely slip again into the violent, murky, world where desperate men are alternately used and hetrayed by the secret agencies of governments. It is a far cry from the life of a prosperous pediatrician, a family man; e piller of his community. But "sonie of us," as he told me, "have other rules to play."

"ORLANDO" DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WILL RECEIVE PREVIOUS PHONE CALL
FROM LOPEZ. HE GATHERED THAT LOPEZ HIMSELF MAY BE ONE OF TWO MEN
WHO WILL CONTACT HIM.

C. OUR MADRID REPRESENTATIVE ASKED WHY ARMANDO LOPEZ HAS
TO SEND MEN FROM UNITED STATES TO UNDERTAKE TERRORIST MISSION IN SPAIN
WHEN MANY CUBAN EXILES LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY. "ORLANDO" SAID THAT
EITHER NO ONE FROM BRIGADE 2506 RESIDES IN SPAIN OR THERE IS NO
MEMBER OF THAT BRIGADE IN SPAIN WHOM LOPEZ TRUSTS. HE EXPLAINED THAT
THERE HAD BEEN CHANGES IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE BRIGADE IN LAST SIX
MONTHS. BORLANDO BOSCH MADE BID TO TAKE OVER BRIGADE LEADERSHIP
FROM VENEZUELA BUT THIS WAS REJECTED BY LOPEZ SO THAT BOSCH SET UP
HIS OWN ORGANIZATION AND WENT ON WITH THE RECENT DESTRUCTION IN
FLIGHT OF CUBAN PLANE WITHOUT ANY CONNECTION WITH BRIGADE 2506. OUR
REPRESENTATIVE GOT IMPRESSION THAT LOPEZ, WHO FORLANDO" SAID WAS
"DELIGHTED" WITH BOSCH'S "SUCCESS" IS NOW TRYING TO COMPETE IN CUBAN
TERRORIST BUSINESS AND IS PLANNING KILL ANY CUBAN FEIDELISTA OR EVEN
SPANISH COMMUNEST HE CAN GET ACCESS TO DURING TRIP TO SPAIN.

HERNAN RICARDO WHO IS ALSO IMPLICATED IN THE PLANE CRASH ADMITTED THAT HE WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THIS BOMBING AS WELL AS OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, HE SAID THAT THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY IN VENEZUELA

1. SOURCE OF PARAGRAPHS 2-61 A VENEZUELAN BUSINESSMAN WHOSE
   ACTIVITIES BRING HIM INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT
   OFFICIALS. HIS RELIABILITY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. HE RECEIVED
   THE INFORMATION FROM SOMEONE WHO SPOKE WITH ORLANDO BOSCH.

2. IN MID-NOVEMBER 1976 CUBAN EXILE LEADER ORLANDO BOSCH,
   WHO IS CURRENTLY UNDER DETENTION IN VENEZUELA IN CONNECTION WITH
   THE 6 OCTOBER BOMBING OF A CUBANA AIRLINER, SAID THAT THE BOMBING
   OF THE PLANE IN THE AIR HAD BEEN A MISTAKE. ACCORDING TO THE PLAN,
   THE PLANE WAS TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED WHILE ON THE GROUND IN TRINIDAD
   AND NOT IN THE AIR. BOSCH SAID. BOSCH ADDED THAT IT WAS NOT INTENDED
   THAT ANY ONE SHOULD BE KILLED AND AS IT TURNED OUT, THE INCIDENT HAS
   BEEN COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. BOSCH BLAMED THIS ON THE STUPIDITY OF
   HERNAN RICARDO AND FREDDY LUGO, WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNDER
   ARREST IN CONNECTION WITH THE INCIDENT. (SOURCE COMMENT: WHILE
   BOSCH DID NOT ACTUALLY ADMIT THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE CUBANA
   BOMBING, HIS STATEMENT CLEARLY INDICATES THAT HE HAD PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
   OF THE INCIDENT.)

CUBANA INCIDENT FROM VENEZUELA. THIS, BOSCH SAID, IS NOT TRUE. BOSCH FURTHER ASSERTED THAT HE HAS HONORED HIS AGREEMENT WITH PEREZ THAT HE WOULD NOT CARRY OUT ANTI-CUBAN ACTIVITIES IN VENEZUELA IF PEREZ LET HIM ENTER VENEZUELA WITHOUT DIFFICULTY, (SOURCE COMMENT: BOSCH IMPLIED THAT, WHILE HE DID PLAN THE OPERATION, SUCH PLANS WERE NOT CARRIED OUT IN VENEZUELA.)

4. BOSCH SAID THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE CUBANA CRASH, ORLANDO GARCIA, PRESIDENT PEREZ' INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY ADVISER, HAD PLANNED TO GET BOSCH OUT OF VENEZUELA. PRESIDENT PEREZ, BELIEVING BOSCH HAD GONE BACK ON HIS AGREEMENT, ORDERED GARCIA TO ARREST BOSCH. GARCIA DID, HOWEVER, WARN BOSCH OF HIS FORTHCOMING DETENTION AND GAVE HIM AN HOUR AND A HALF TO ARRANGE HIS AFFAIRS BEFORE GARCIA ARRESTED HIM. BOSCH SAID THAT AT THE TIME HE DID NOT REALLY TAKE GARCIA'S WARNING SERIOUSLY. (FIELD COMMENT! IN HVC-7514, TDFIRDB-315/10256-76, OF 15 OCTOBER, A USUALLY RELIABLE SOURCE REPORTED THAT GARCIA INTENDED TO ESCORT BOSCH TO THE COLOMBIAN BORDER.)

# Informe Noviembre 22 de 1976

H/ Attachment to
TM 180212, 16 Dec 76

Respecto a sus instrucciones de indogar sobre las actividades de Orlando Boch durante sus visitas a Guatemala, paso a informarle lo si- guiente.

El Embajador de Costa Rica en Honduras, Edwin GÃ³ngora, me dijo (21 de noviembre) que a principios de este aÃ±o recibiÃ³ de su Gobierno instrucciones de averiguar cuales eran sus contactos en Guatemala. Dijo que el propio ministro de relaciones exteriores de Costa Rica, Gonzalo Faccio, le habÃ­a mostrado un documento procedente de. la CIA (estas fue- ron sus palabras) en el cual se demostrabaja que Boch habÃ­a tenido rela- ciones en Guatemala con el hijo del ex-presidente Arana, Jorge Roberto Arena EspaÃ±a (Tito).

AgregÃ³ GÃ³ngora que era muy probable que el contacto entre Boch y Tito Arana se hubiera hecho por medio de los cubanos Gerardo Sampedro y Moreira, con quienes el segundo tiene negocios.

Recuerdo que, efectivamente, cuando GÃ³ngora me hablÃ³ de esta asun- to, a principios de este aÃ±o (mÃ¡s o menos en mayo) me mencionÃ³ la circune- tancia de que Faccio fuÃ© a Guatemala para comunicar al canciller guatemal- teco, Adolfo Molina Orantes, los temores del Gobierno costarricense por les actividades de Boch. GÃ³ngora recordÃ³ en nuestra. Gitime conversaciÃ³n que tal visite habÃ­a coincidido con el stantado de que fuÃ© victime Tito Arana y que, inclusive se mencionÃ³ que una cosa y le otre podrien ester selecionadest sus contactos con Boch y el atentado.

ComentÃ© GÃ³ngora tambien que Tate Arena hecis frecuentes viajes e Miemi, donde es posible -dijo que qubiera hecha amistad con otros cubancs anticastristes residentes allf.

AgregÃ³ GÃ³ngora que cuando se la comunico de parte de su gobierno este asunto, recuerda haber escuchado que el atro hijo del expresidente Arane (Carlitos) tambihen astaba relacionado con las actividades subversives contra Oduber. ComentÃ³ que Carlitos es aviedor y pudo haber ofrecido ayude. aeres, mediante sus amigos que tiene en les FAQ

Dise GÃ³ngore que faccio le manaland tambiÃ©n le posibilidad de que Boch hubiere tenido conecciÃ³n con el vicepresidente Quatemalteco, Mario Ben- dovel AlarcÃ³n, pero que se carecla de pruebes sobre elle. Me dijo ahora que al Presidente Laugerud le ofreciÃ³ a faccio poner freno a esse actividades y


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 66

2) 
que desde enconces no ha recibido ninguna otra instrucciÃ³n de su Gobierno, por lo que supone que Laugerud cumpliÃ³ su promesa. Cree GÃ³ngora que desde entonces (mayo de este aÃ±o) Boch no volviÃ³ a Guatemala.

# SPECIAL REPORT Cuban Extremists in U.S.
A GROWING TERROR THREAT

![map of mexico, cuba, dominican republic, haiti republic, jamaica, puerto rico, barbados, venezuela]

Out from Miami spreads a wave of violence. Terrorists' aim is to topple Castro, free Cuba. Nearly all Cuban refugees share this dream. But the acts of a few zealots create trouble for fellow exiles and for the U.S.

Reported from
MIAMI and WASHINGTON

Terrorism by radical Cuban refugees has become a thorny problem in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and, in the view of some authorities, a potential threat to the lives of American leaders.

The terrorists' goal is to wrest control of Cuba away from its Communist dictator, Fidel Castro.

In pursuit of that goal, they have blazed a trail of violence from Miami across the Caribbean Sea, not only to Cuba but also to Mexico, Barbados, Jamaica and Panama-even across the South Atlantic to Argentina.

They have engaged in a series of bombings in the U.S. and abroad. They have carried out military-style attacks on Communist ships. They are strongly suspected of several killings.

A federal grand jury in Miami is investigating their activities and their leaders.

Now, as a new Administration prepares to take over in Washington, it is feared that the Cuban terrorists will step up their attacks in an effort to thwart any turn toward reconciliation with Castro.

Officials familiar with their operations warn that none of the Cuban extremists will stop at nothing, not even at assassinating members of the Carter Administration.

"The Cuban terrorists are the most highly trained assassins in the world today," says one U.S. official.

Many of the terrorists were trained by the Central Intelligence Agency in the days when this country was trying to overthrow Castro, or kill him.

The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee recently held hearings on the Cuban-terrorist threat. It heard testimony from Lt. Thomas Lyons, head of a special antiterrorist squad of the Dade County public safety department in

![Dr. Orlando Bosch, an anti-Castro leader, is accused in plane bombing fatal to 73.]

Miami, where Cuban refugees are concentrated:

"The overwhelming majority of the Cubans in Miami are strongly anti-Castro. That's why they came to Miami in the first place. They are also law-abiding citizens who, with minor exceptions, manifest their opposition to Castro in legal ways."

"However, there are a small number of individuals whose hatred of Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro and Communism has led them to engage in extralegal actions and to violate the laws of the country which gave them sanctuary."

These individuals use Dade County as a base for international terrorism against governments allied with Cuba, Cuban shipping, Communists, purported Communists and individuals who take a stand against their terrorist-type attacks.

"Some Cuban groups purporting to be involved in terrorist-type attacks against the Cuban Government are no more or no less than outright criminals, feeding upon the Cuban population and diverting the collected funding for their own purposes."

Other investigators charge that the terrorists, to finance their crusade, have dealt in cocaine and prostitution and in extortion from wealthy fellow refugees.

The number of hard-core terrorists is small, officially estimated at fewer than 300. But their reach is wide. In this year alone they have either bragged about or been accused of such acts as:

*   Machine-gun attacks on the high seas against vessels from Cuba and other Communist nations.
*   Bombing a wide variety of targets in the United States, Latin America and Portugal.
*   Planting a bomb that caused the crash of a Cubana Airlines plane near Barbados on October 6, with the loss of 73 lives.
*   Possible involvement in the still-unsolved bomb death of

# EXILES vs.

CASTRO-
A Relentless
Pursuit

On Jan. 1, 1959, Fidel Castro took power and the first wave of refugees fled Cuba. A small number of the 600,000 exiles who settled in the U.S. have become extremists.

Highlights of events in those 18 years, some involving law-abiding exiles, others involving the extremistsâ

1961: A 1,300-man Cuban Brigade, armed and trained by the U.S. in Florida, Guatemala und Nicaragua, landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south shore. The invasion was a failure.

1962: Survivors of the Bay of Pigs were released by Castro after payment of a 53-million-dollar ransom in drugs, food, medical equipment and other supplies from "private contributions." President John F. Kennedy, in Miami, pledged to the Cuban exiles that the Brigade flag would one day fly over a liberated Cuba.

U.S. launched its secret "Operation Mongoose"âa plan to use Cuban exiles in paramilitary war against Castro while U.S. maintained an economic blockade to shake the island's economy. The attacks generally failed.

1964: Culkan extremists in New York City fired a mortar shell at United Nations as Cuba's ChÃ³ Guevara addressed the General Assembly.

1967: Cuban exile specialists and U.S.-trained Bolivian troops trapped and killed Guevara and some of his Communist guerrillas in Bolivia.

1968-72: Cuban-exile extremists bombed ships of nations considered to be friendly to Castro, terrorized other exiles to keep them in line.

1972: Cuban exiles trained by Contral Intelligence Agency took part in Watergate break-in, later testified that they thought it would help their anti-Castro campaign

1973: U.S. and Cuba signed agreement aimed at controlling hyackleg of aircraft and piracy of ships at sea.

1974-76: Cuban extremists exploded more than 100 bomba in Miami aren in two-year period, hitting offices of the l'ill, a State attorney and the Miami police department.

Exile terrorists attacked airline offices and consul. ates of governments that have diplomatic relations with Castro. Hombings took place in Jamaica, Mexico, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Panama, other countrion. Fishing boats used in Cuba anul Soviet cargo ships were attacked by high-speed motor launches manued by exilo oxtremists.

*   Kidnaping two Culun officials in Argentina.
*   Attempting to kidnap a Cuban consul in Mexico.

Who are these terrorists? What motivates them? How do they operate? And why are U.S. officials so concerned about what they may do in the future?

To answer such questions, Orr Kelly and Carl J. Migdail of the US News & World Report stall dug deeply into the records, interviewed Cuban refugees who share the hopes though not the methods of the terrorists, and talked to law-enforcement officials who are trying to stem the violence.

## BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISM

After Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and it became apparent that he intended to establish a Communist state. 800,000 Cubans "voted with their feet" and fled their homeland. Some 600,000) of them settled in the United States.. They and their children now total 750,000. Most of them live in the Miami area.

The majority of these immigrants are low abiding. But Miami's "Little Havana" provides a culture in which the virus of violence can grow.

"In Miami," explains one refugee leader, "the Cubans keep their national identity, their heritage, traditions. hatreds and their hopes of going back to their homeland. And they know they can't go back until Castro is gone. So they dream of topplina Castro. What is clearly unrealistic in other places in the United States sovins very possible in the atmosphere in Miami."

In the early tits, the overthrow of Castro seemed to the Cubans in exile to be not only possible but almost inevitable. It was U.S. policy to drive him from power. There was on attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 with an army of Cuban exiles recruited and trained in secret by the CIA. The invaders were not given the air cover necessary for a successful attack, and the operation was a disaster. Only 180 of about 1,300 invaders escaped death or capture. The Cubans felt betrayed.

Then came other American moves against Castro. There Was a secret "Operation Mongoose," which inchurled efforts to assassinate the Cuban leader. The United States backed an economie blockade of Cuba in an attempt to prevent Castro from obtaining sorely needed supplies and equipement from abroud. Later, Cuban refugees were used to carry out secret operations not only in the Caribbean but also in other parts of Latin America-and.even in Mrtea,

slogans and initials of yet another group. Among groups named in testimony before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee are: Accion Cubana, or Cuban Action: Alpha 66, a name adopted when victory in 1966 seemed possible: FLNC, standing for Frente de Liberacion Nacional de Cuba, which means Cuban National Liberation Front, and Pragma- tistas, which means what it sounds like-pragmatists..

A group calling itself Zero issued a "death list" of people marked for killing and, according to officials, several persons on the list soon died violent deaths.

Dade County's antiterrorist head, Lieutenant Lyons, says he has stopped trying to keep track of the groups and instead concentrates on trying to solve the crimes that they are suspected of having committed. He has no shortage of business. Here is a sample of the violence attributed to terrorists in the last two years:

*   Since February, 1975, there have been at least seven assassination attempts directed against refugee leaders who were viewed as opponents of the terrorists' tactics. Three men were shot to death. One was killed by a bomb. Three other attempted killings failed, but a prominent radio broad- caster lost both legs below the knees when a bomb ripped his car apart.
*   On Dec. 3-4, 1975, bombs blasted the Miami office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a Social Security office, a. State unemployment office, two post offices, a bank, a State attorney's office and the Miami police-departinent headquar ters. A man accused of those bombings, and also the bombing of the Miami International Airport two months earlier, was acquitted recently in a federal court. He is to be tried again in a State court.
*   A number of bombs have been exploded in New York. One blow out the window of the Venezuelan consulate on Fith Avenue, across the street from St. Patrick's sthedral.
*   On Feb. 12, 1976, a Soviet freighter, the Dzhordano Bruno, was sitting motionless 35 miles off Cuba's north coust while its tanks were being cleaned. Suddenly a small boat raced close to the freighter and raked it with heavy machine- gun fire. No one was injured..
*   On April 6, 1976, two Cuban fishing boats were attacked and a fisherman was killed.
*   On Sept. 21, 1976, in Washington, D.C., a bomb ex- plodem a car and killed Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean Ambasador to the U.S. under the Marxist regime of the late President Salvador Allende. Although the crime is officially unsolved, there have been persistent reports that the bonb was planted by Cuban terrorists as a "favor" to the secret police of the present anti-Communist Government in. Chile.

## NEW TERRORIST STRATEGY

Lenders of the terrorist bunds are hurd to identify. But one man has emerged as an apparent loader: Dr: Orlando Dosch, â¢ pediatrician, Ilo was caught firing a Imzooka at a Polish ship in Miami harbor in 1908 and was sentenced to 10 years In priann.

Dr. Bosch was released on parole after four yours, but he reportedly returned to the movement. ile is now under arrest in Venexuola, charged along with three other men in connection with the Culan airliner bombing. Dr. Bosch in described as the louder of the group calling laolf Acelon Cubana.

In June of this year, Dr. Bosch called a small group of his follow activists together in the Dominican Republic. They were sharply divided on policy and strategy.

Bome wanted to avoid the risks of further attacks in the United States and to concontrato their offorts against Castro outelde this country. Others hold out for continuing their activities hoth hore and abroud.

After a houted argument, a shaky agreement was reached

> [Figure] Automobile bombing that killed a Cuban refugee in Miami is one of many unsolved crimes attributed to anti-Castro terrorists.
> The picture shows a destroyed car, a result of the event.

to focus their efforts outside the U.S. To direct the activities, a new group was formed with the initials CORU, which stand for Coordinacion de Organizaciones Revolucionaires Unidas in Spanish or Co-ordinating Committee of United Revolu- tionary Organizations in English.

Anmerican law-enforcement oflicials say that members of CORU have the backing of powerful forces, perhaps even the governments themselves, in some countries of Latin America. The terrorists are described as "at home" in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Chile. They are well, armed for terroristic acts, as shown in the box on page 32.

Since the June meeting, a new wave of terrorism has swept across the Caribbean and beyond. Bombs have, damaged Cuban airline facilities in Barbados, Jamaica and Panamu, Two Cuban officials were kidnaped in Argentina.

On July 23, three men who had nown from Miami carrying three coffeo cans filled with plastic explosive attempted to kielmap Cuban Consul Daniel Ferrer Fernandez-in MÃ©rida. Mexico. He escrÃºpeed, but a Calui fisheries expert was killed.

The most serious act of terrorism came on October 6, when a Cubana Airlines DC-8 exploded in flight shortly after taking off from Barbados. The plane fell into the sea, killing 73 persons including members of the Cuban national fencing team.

In messages to nows media, both CORU and El Condor, a group unheard of previously, claimed responsibility for the crush of the phure,

Dr. Bosch, who has traveled freely on documents appar ently provided by officials of Governments friendly to the anti-Castro movement, was picked up in Veriezuela and on November 2 was charged with honleide in connection with the plane crash. Three other men are similarly charged.

The arrests of Dr.. Durch and his coltorts, instead of reducing terrorist viaknier, umy actually stimulate more violence. El Condor, in a message to the United. Prens International on November thated the fonte men held by the Venezuelans are limwont mul warowed that, if they are convleted, planer of the VenezÄ±ndan International Airways will be attacked: On the wane day, CORU went a message mying it wond join with the Honduran Anti-Communist Alliance in attacks on three airlines that plan excursion Nights to Havam.

Roberto Carballo, a militant leader of veterans of the Hay of lige invasion, ionomerd the threatened attacks. "li atcla Castro by making all Cuban exites look like mad bombers" Carballo said.

## ORACKDOWN BY LAW OFFICERS

[continued from preceding page]

includes representatives from Dade County and Miami police, the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force, its agents work closely with it.

With co-operation from Cuban refugees who are sick of the terrorist violence, law officers have arrested a number of suspects. Police also have learned enough about other suspects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence can be limited even though there is not enough evidence to prosecute them.

A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might have some knowledge of terror operations.

Efforts of law-enforce.nent officials to deal with the terrorist groups face formidable handicaps, however. The terrorists seem to know what police are doing. Lieutenant Lyons relates that one suspect "identified one of my officers who had never met him before, called him by name and told him what section he worked in and what his duties were."

Terrorists are protected by a web of old loyalties: Most of them worked at one time or another for the U.S. Government. Many have had several roles: members of the U.S. Army, CIA operatives and FBI informants. One refugee leader suggests that law-enforcement officials have not found the killers of Cubans "because they don't want to."

A further complication is the heavy infiltration of the terrorist movement by members of Castro's intelligence corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as agents provocateurs, instigating terrorist acts designed to discredit the refugees and influence American policy."

The Cuban Prime Minister has "surfaced" enough of such agents to reveal their pattern of operation. Farly this year, for example, Manuel de Armas, a Cuban refugee who was named in Senate committee testimony as having been involved in terrorist activities in Miami, showed up in Havana. In an April 22 broadcast by Radio Havana, De Armas said that he had supplied the explosives used in the killing of a man named Rolando Masferrer and that a CIA agent had provided him with the explosives.

In a speech on October 15, Castro boasted of a double agent who Castro claimed had passed on coded instructions from the CLA. Said Castro: "From the very moment when he was recruited by the CIA and over a period of 10 years, the supposed agent has kept the Cuban Coverament fully informed of all his contacts with [the CIA] and of the equipment and instructions he has received."

Castro blamed the CIA for the airliner bombing and other acts of violence. "Who else but the CIA can curry out these acts?" Castro asked.

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S. involvement in the airliner bombing. 1le said: "I can state categorically that no official of the United States Government, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in contact with the Ancrican Government has had anything to do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this totally reprehensible."

The CIA declines to discuss Cuban refugee terrorism..

Officials of other Government agencies say they seriously doubt that the CIA, after all the criticisin it has received for some of its earlier, activities, is still involved in operations against the Castro regime. However, the agency is described as providing very little help in combatting the terrorist groups. "We have absolutely no contact with the CIA," says Lieutenant Lyons. "I'd like to, but they don't talk to us." One reason for that attitude may be that laws bar the CIA from domestic law-enforcement activities.

Other laws, or the lack of them, also complicate the fight against the terrorists. U.S. agencies cannot become involved in investigations of terrorism outside the United States unless the crime involves violations of neutrality laws making it illegal to conspire in this country to commit crimes abroad or to export arins without a license.

Although shocked by the October 6 airliner hombing. U.S. officials reluctantly decided there was no authorization for the FBI to enter that ease.

With such handicaps as these, law enforcement officials say they can look forward to only limited success against the terrorists. Any real solution to the problem must come from within the Cuban refugee community-and investigators state that the co-operation they get there does not extend to cases of violence committed outside the U.S.

As officials size up the effects of the terrorist campaign The only tangible accomplishment has been to push Castro into renouncing the antihijacking treaty, thus discouraging efforts toward a diplomatte reconciliation between the United States and Cabu.

Despite all the terrorist plots and attacks, Cautre romalus-firinly swated as head of a Communist regime In Cba. And it appears to the refugos almost inevitable that the movement totward some kind of decommodation with Castro will be romumed by American policy makors. Throughout "Little Havana," sho foar is wikloepread that Jimmy Carter, when he becomes Frosidont, will give now impotus to this movement, and that their homeland will never be liberated from Communist rule.

To both officials and Cuban rougoo leaders, tavoine inevitalite that the terrorists will continue their attempts to koop the two countries apart by the only method they know-further acts of violence.

The Senate created a commission to investigate terrorist activities, conspiracies to disrupt order and disrespect for authorities.

The commission will also submit to the Senate a bill to regulate the activities of the exile organizations and persons not subject to the control of the state.

Senator Hermogenes Lopes stated that the commission should also investigate the "300 Cubans who form part of the Cuban Embassy in Venezuela."

Organisations of exiles from Cuba, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Spain and Portugal are currently operating in Cor8088.

CUBAN ANTI-CASTRO LEADER DENIES ACCUSATIONS

Madrid EFR in Spanish 1534 ÎÎÎ¤ 16 Nov 76 PA

[Text] Caracas, 16 Nov--The anti-Castro leader Orlando Bosch categorically denied he had planned the assassination of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, of Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Gonzalo Facio and of Pascal Allende and his girl friend.

Bosch's denial was conveyed by his lawyer Francisco Leandro More, who said that his defendant "never talked to Pacio and that when Pascal Allende arrived in Costa Rica, Bosch had been in this country for 40 days."

Bosch said: Even if they try to make me look like a professional hoodium, I ans gentleman who respects agreements." By this he meant that "he case to Venesuela sponsored by some influential personalities," Kors pointed out.

Hors also said: "As a politician, Bosch still does not understand what the plot is against him, in which Fidel's intelligence services show an interest in Kissinger's life and CIA agents are trying to destroy all those struggling against the Cuban regime,"

Leandro Kora added that Bosch claims that he personally does not know Rolando Otero, a Ouban, also hired to kill Kissinger, according to reports from Miami, but that "he knows who he is."

Bosch is being prosecuted by Venezuelan authorities, presumably as the brain behind the sabotage of the Cuban plans which on 6 October exploded near Barbados killing 73 persens, och claime be se innocent.

## PCO LEADER ACCUSES U.S. OF INTERVENTION IN L.A.

Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 0000 GMT 17 Nov 76

[Text] PCC Central Committee member Raul Valdes Vivo, who is participating as a guest in the opening conference of autumn courses of the School of Economy of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said in a lecture he gave today that the United States has intervened in Latin America with troops and capital.

This year's autumn courses of the Mexican university deal with the topic "World economy and social changes." In his speech, the chief of the PCC Central Committee Foreign Relations General Department pointed out that Mexico as a people and as a country has always defended the right of the Cuban people to choose its own path.

Valdes Vivo said that Cuba is building true socialism since it began to follow a process different from the one being followed to date by the other countries of the continent, a process which makes the right to self-determination a common cause for the rest of Latin America. Internationalism and its practice, Valdes Vivo said in his speech, has always been directed at--from the days of the Paris commune to the Spanish Civil War and to the Angulan conflict--giving support to peoples who struggle with their own strength for the continuation of their own history and against forces that have come from abroad sent by the enemies of those peoples.

Valdes Vivo affirmed that revolutions cannot be exported; nevertheless, the United States has intervened in Latin America with its troops and its dollars and has taken part of the territories of some countries, as in the case of Mexico.

## GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORT OF THE MASSES, SAYS OVALLE

Mexico City INFORMEX in Spanish to ANSA Buenos Aires 2131 GMT 16 Nov 76-PL

[Text] Mexico City, 16 Nov (ANSA--INFORMEX)--"The Mexican state does not control or manipulate the worker, peasant and popular sectors, on the contrary, it only has their support and that is why the government is not afraid of fascism," affirmed Ignacio Ovalle Pernandos, secretary of the presidency of the republic, who asked all Mexicans to stop listening to the rumors that are being spread throughout the country.

In statements made prior to the opening ceremony of the first international conference on the family, which is being held in this capital, Ovalle Fernandes warned that, in view of the consolidation of the popular base, any aggression of the minority classes will not have any possibility of success in Mexico.

## $1.33-MILLION TRADE DEFICIT REPORTED

Mexico City INFORMEX in Spanish to ANDA Buenos Aires 2118 GMT 15 Nov 76

[Text] Mexico City, 15 Nov (ANDA--INFORMEX)--Mexico's trade balance experienced a $1.33-billion deficit in the first 8 months of this year. This is contained in an Industry and Commerce Secretariat study which also discloses that growth in importations was similar to that during all of 1975.

As far as exports are concerned, the drop experienced in sugar exports should be pointed out, sugar sales during the first 8 months of 1975 amounted to 1.979 billion pesos, while the figure was only 1,656 billion pesos for the same period this year. The increase in importations is based primarily on the acquisition of nondurable consumer goods, including condensed and evaporated milk, cereals, pharmaceutical products and alcoholic beverages.

TO: Chief, Latin America Division

FROM: Chief of Station, Quito

SUBJECT: RYBAT KMSTONE VWNOCK/NOC Byron W. GUTRADT's Past Contacts with Orlando Bosch and WKSCARLET-3

WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES & METHODS. INVOLVED

1.  We understand from press accounts that Orlando Bosch, WKSCARLET-3 and several other Cuban exiles were recently arrested and charged with the sabotage of a Cubana Airlines airliner on 6 October. After having read these accounts NOC Byron W. GUTRADT reported, for the record, that he once knew Bosch and WKSCARLET-3 in the early 1960's. GUTRADT met WKSCARLET-3 in 1964 when both were enrolled in OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia. GUTRADT at that time had already terminated his relationship with BKHERALD. While at OCS GUTRADT was not particularly close to WKSCARLET-3 but WKSCARLET-3 was generally knowledgeable of GUTRADT's background and past BKHERALD activities. GUTRADT has not seen WKSCARLET-3 since 1964 after completion of the OCS course and doubts seriously that WKSCARLET-3 would remember him.

2.  GUTRADT met Bosch circa 1963 in Miami when GUTRADT was training Bosch in a BKHERALD-sponsored program.. Bosch only knew GUTRADT in alias. GUTRADT has not seen Bosch since completion of this training.

3.  Given the length of time that has elapsed plus the lack of closeness to either WKSCARLET-3 or Bosch, GUTRADT and the Station do not believe that their knowledge of his past BKHERALD activities presents any security problems today. GUTRADT, of course, was unwitting of their alleged current activities and was surprised to hear of the bombing of the Cubana airliner.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: Raymond A. Warren
Chief, Latin America Division

VIA: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Alleged Chilean Plot to Use Cuban Exiles to Kill Andres PASCAL Allende, Nephew of Former Chilean President. Salvador ALLENDE

1.  The Washington Post carried an article on 12 November 1976 claiming that a Venezuelan Secret Police Officer, Ricardo MORALES, had told FBI contacts that early last year Chile's Secret Police (DINA) sought to assassinato Andres PASCAL Allende and his companion Anne Marie Brussier. The information contained in the article for the most part coincides with information in our files.

2.  A source of the Caracas Station reported on 17 February 1976 that anti-Cuban government exiles were planning to kill PASCAL Allende who was in exile in Costa Rica at the time. This source also reported that the Cuban exiles claimed to be working under the sponsorship of the Chilean Government and that tho attempt against PASCAL Allende would be carried out by the Cubans in return for unspecified aid to be given cortain Cuban exile leaders, including Orlando BOSCII and Frank CASTRO. Those individuals reportedly would onginoor the assassination. This information was passed to the FBI and the Department of State.

3.  On 17 February the San Jose Station notified the local authoritios that BOSCII might be on his way to a Contral American country and that he might be using a Chilean passport. BOSCH had boon of Interest to those officials for some time because of his possible involvement with bombings In Costa Rica and also because of the thon exported visit of Secretary of State Honry Kissinger. On 18 February BOSCH was apprehended.

4.  On 20 February the San Jono Station raised with the local authorities the specific threat against PASCAL Allende. Thore authorities stated that they had already advised PASCAL Allende of the possible throat against his life. BOSCII was deported on 20 March 1970.

# FBI Told of Chilean Plot to Use Cubans to Kill Allende K

By Jue Crankshaw
The Niemi Hreald

MIANH--The Chilean secret police last bruary attempted to recruit two albered Cuban exile terrorists to asasinate the nephew of Chile's late Cepurest Marxist President Salvador Silende, a ranking South American Intelligence oficial told U.S. authori-

Ù¡:Ù¢Ù 

The Intelligence official, Reardo Morales of the Venezurlan secret police told FBI contacts that Chile's secret police (DINA) sought the assassination of both Andres Pascal Allende and his companion, Anne Marie Brussier, according to documents made Available to The Miami Herald.

Morales, himself a Cuban exile, said the DINA plot, which was never carried out, was reported to him by Ro-Lando Otero, who curtatly faces trial in Miami on 19 felony charges related tomme terroust bombings here.

Susparions of Chilean secret police incelement in plots against political exiles have been widely expressed in enute circles. This was the first re-pufted Instance of an allegation to the Fill by a high-ranking intelligence official suggesting complicity of the Chilean intelligence service in political assassination activities. Morales had himself been associated with the Central Intelligence Agency and FBI as an operative and informant after flecing Cuba following Castro's accession to power.]

At the time of Morales' report to the FBI, Otero was a fugitive from a Miami federal grand jury indictment related to the bombings. He was subsequently acquitted of that charge earlier this year at a federal trial in Jacksonville.

Morales quoted Otero as saying DINA had attempted to recruit both Otero and Orlando Bosch for the assassination. Bosch was charged in Venezuela last week with first-degree murder in the sabotage of a Cuban airliner that claimed 73 lives.

Morales quoted Otero as saying DINA offered arms and funds to Cuban exile groups.

Otero refused to do the "favor," left Chile and told the Latin American intelligence official on Feb. 15, then returned to Santiago. He was arrested two weeks later and held until he was handed over to the United States in May.

Bosch was arrested entering Costa Rica with a false passport on Feb. 19. He was charged with plotting to kill U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, Andres Pascal Allende and Anne Marie Brussier.

No trial was held and Boseli was later deported. He returned to Santiago and apparently remained there until going to the Caribbean area to organize CORU, a militant anti-Castro group which claimed credit for the Cuban airliner bombing last month.

Morales made the reports to the FBI in an exchange of intelligence with U.S. officials about exiled terrorists' plots.

An FSI spokesman in Washington said Monday the bureau would have no comment on the reported DINA plot. (FBI officials in Caracas had no comment on the case in response to Independent inquiries by The Washington Post.]

Information on alleged DINA Cuban exile conspiracy against the surviving Allende family and government members was suppressed during the federal bombing trial of Otero in Jacksonville in September, 1976.

When Otero started to testify about his activities in Chile. government prosecutors objected that the information was immaterial to the hombing charges.

Otero was fourd innocent of federal charges that be placed bombs at Miami International Airport in October, and at the Miami FBI office, Social Security Office, State Unemployment Office, two post offices, a bank; the Dade State Attorneys Office and the Miami Police Department Headquarters on Dec. 34

His trial on related state charges was to begin here Monday but was ordered postponed until after the bexin-ning of the year and transferred to Pensacola.

Otero remained in Florida until late December. 1975, when he was told by an FBI informant that the FBI was preparing to have him indicted on the bombing charges.

Otero then went to the Dominican Republic, where he was arrested, then paroled to the custody of Admiral Cesar de Windt, father-in-law of Frank Castro, an Otero friend.

When a Miami federal grand joy returned indictment against Otero in the bambings. Otero fies to Caracas

Otero had $50 in his pocket when he lazded ba Tenicia, according to forciation in FBI reports. He stayed with Morales, a furizer Cum politi then wurking with the Tenernelas sr cret police

Information contained in the reports alleges that Okere was told that if Venezian axixitis mesed bar rest him, he owned receive ar with the new Chicar: alabussardine

While in Caracas, Obero afirgedry told Morales that he that caccctted the borbings in Mar, erept for the Miami polire departoret explosiona

He said he knew who placed that bomb. Morales sent the reformation to the FBL

In early February. Otere fire to Santiago, according to the intePigence reports in the lands of investigators

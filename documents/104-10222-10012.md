2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

15 September 1977

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Services Staff

FROM : Charles A. Briggs
DDO Information Review Officer

SUBJECT : Appreciation

1.  As you know well, on September 19th, I turn over responsibility for release or denial of DDO documents under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The experience has been both frustrating and challenging, epitomizing the issues in transition from a totally classified past to a new intelligence environment yet to be defined. The tension in law between protection of sources and methods and more open government was apparent, dai-ly, to those involved; good case law was made as we sought to adhere to both principles and to regain, through this process, some credibility for the Agency.

2.  I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation for the truly magnificent support I got from what is now the Privacy and Information Action Group, through recommenda- tions for the Unit Citation subsequently awarded by the DCI, through QSI's. and promotions, and through personal comment. All have worked long hard hours and all, those now in PIAG and those who have left, deserve credit for their professional efforts in this arena; I want to express my thanks to you for the assistance your people gave to me as the DDO Information Review Officer.

3.  At the risk of being unfair to some who are more recent arrivals, I want to express particular and very personal thanks to Win Brown, Cis Cass, Lou Dube, Mary Felton, Doris LeBaron, Fred McCann, Karen Rice, Helen Stilson, Jon Wolfe and Mack Wood.

4.  My debt to Fred Randall and Andy Addona has been made a matter of record on several occasions. Let me just note here that any supervisor who has had the kind of qualitative backing that those two gentlemen gave me is fortunate indeed.

For OPF, Randall, Frederick

5. In addition to the PIAG crowd, Paul Haefner's people have had the endless and repetitive job of searching the CHAOS files and helping me deal with that most sensitive aspect of past history. Please express my thanks to them and, most particularly, to Paul himself.

6. Finally, let me make special note of the contributions from Joe Gigliotti and the retired officers handling the OSS records requests. Their particular expertise was a welcome addition to the staff support received.

7. I'm sure all will give Bob Owen, in his new role, the same high quality support that they gave to me. To state the obvious, although the win record is quite good, the race is still on.

12 February 1976

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDO Evaluation Board

THROUGH: C/CNG

SUBJECT: Promotion Recommendation - Frederick C. Randall to GS-15

1. This memorandum constitutes a formal recommendation that Fred Randall, GS-14/8, now Chief of the DDO Privacy Information (DDO/PIC) unit in Services Staff, be promoted to GS-15. The position calls for that grade.

2. Mr. Randall is 49 years of age; entered on duty in CIA in September 1951 as a GS-7 assigned to OSO/FDZ. He is married; has four children, served briefly in the Air Force (1945-46); has an AB in Government, an AM in Foreign Affairs, and was a PhD candidate in International Relations. His Agency service was in FE from 1953 to 1965, including overseas tours in Djakarta and Tokyo; in DOD/FRD from 1965 to March 1975, including 2 years in the DC field office; his current assignment dates from 16 March 75. His date of grade is June 1967.

3. The specifics of Mr. Randall's current assignment and all the superlatives about it I have just recounted in a fitness report which I prepared today, as well as in a QSI recommendation (approved) of October 1975 and an out-of-cycle promotion recommendation dated 8 August 1975. I rate his performance Outstanding and refer the reader(s) to the reports cited for details. I would note here that Mr. Randall changed his home base and functional category in November of 1975 and was rated number 1 of 4 Category C nominees from this Staff by all four members of the SS Panel. I would note further that when I submitted my August 75 out-of-cycle promotion recommendation, Mr. Randall's career designation was B/OG; given his personal circumstances the DDO suggested that Randall change his career designation to become more competitive "and have an excellent chance on the next go round." The QSI suggestion then resulted.

4. As the individual responsible for releasing or denying thousands of DDO documents in response to FOIA requests, and subsequently answering for DDO decisions in affidavits and court depositions, I know how well Fred does his work and how richly he deserves this promotion to GS-15.

SUBJECT: One-Time Reclama - Requested Randall Promotion

As you know, OB is not reticent about expressing his views, and in the informal career development world, Fred had had it in FRD. I've known OB fairly well and respect his candor and professionalism; we just worked very well together on the GS-16/17 Panel, with an interestingly identical philosophy. Fred's performance did not satisfy OB, and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact. It does not surprise me, since Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975, that his Fitness Reports for the past years would put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/OS officers. But that's yesterday.

Today, as I tried to say strongly in my 8 August memo, my view of his work is that it is Outstanding--and I don't so rate many officers. I would hope his present work could stand on its own merit, and project forward, expecting FOIA to be a way of life in the DDO with all the management challenge, and headache, that poses. His present and future peer competition should be with the A/C crowd, not the B/OS group--if that hurdle is determining.

At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case in what I consider the appropriate competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cycle suggestion doing mischief to the system. Any hope?

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recommendation:
Fred Randall

1. We've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency and DDO implications of the Freedom of Information Act and, now, the Privacy Act, including the increased number of appeals and litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of deponents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you and me. The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information to the outside world.

2. Fred is a CS-14/7. He had just come to me at the time of the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for promotion by FRD. I consider his performance over the past 6 months to have been Outstanding. He is head and shoulders above the other directorates' FIOs; I have considerable laudatory testimony from OGC, OLC, O/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded, protection of DDO sources and methods. This includes occasional arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OCC and OLC lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.

3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in turn, has mentioned it to Gordon. The return signals I got sounded positive.

4. I do, therefore, recommend that you, approve Fred's promotion to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can be cut.

16 MAR 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services
Career Service, Section A

SUBJECT: Frederick C. RANDALL, Recommendation for
Promotion to GS-14.

1. It is recommended that Frederick C. Randall be promoted from GS-13 to GS-14. Subject is 40 years old and began his Agency career in 1951. He has been a GS-13 since 1958. He entered on duty at the Washington Base (then Washington Station) in August 1965.

2. Subject is responsible for Washington Base operational activity directed against FE Division targets. He replaced one GS-14 officer and one GS-13 officer who shared this responsibility before Subject's arrival. Since Subject's EOD at the Base, the tempo and quality of operations against FE targets has increased greatly. During the period before Sukarno's overthrow in October 1966, positive intelligence reporting from two agents handled by Subject (WUSHARK and WUFLY) made significant contributions to WOFACT assessments of Indonesian events. Reporting in recent months continues to be useful to Djakarta and, in the case of WUSHARK, Subject has brought an agent to the point of being willing to request posting to Peking to cover FE targets there. Subject has an encyclopedic knowledge of Asian history and current events, and his handling of Asian agents has shown excellent sophistication, perception and maturity. He has been systematic in his exploitation of the total capabilities of his agents and contacts and has not been content to limit himself to procurement of positive or operational intelligence from their own embassies or countries. At the request of the local FBI office, Subject has guided one of his agents (WUFLY) into a close relationship with a Soviet Bloc intelligence officer and the FBI has expressed its appreciation for Subject's professional handling of this and other cases in which he has

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

SECRET

-2-

been involved on its behalf. Subject has an excellent CE mind and a healthy scepticism at all stages of any operational situation. His analysis and handling of the WUAPEX case is cited by way of demonstration of his willingness and ability to probe in painstaking fashion before committing the Agency; his careful debriefing and interrogation of WUAPEX were key factors in the ultimate decision not to plunge ahead on this controversial caso. His poise and tact in the development of the sensitive WUTHAL operation has resulted in Agency acquisition of a well-placed agent within the Burmese Embassy at a time when contacts with official Burmese are extremely difficult. Subject is officially registered in the American University Graduate School and makes excellent use of the academic cover thus acquired to supplement his official cover when such is deemed advisable (as in the WUTHAL case).

3.. An examination of Subject's file shows that he has been recommended for promotion to GS-14 a total of seven times (four by FE Division and, with this request,. three times by DO Division). Aside from the fact that he is definitely performing at the GS-14 level, we believe this to be an important factor to be considered in the present promotion request.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services
Career Service, Section A

SUBJECT : Frederick C. RANDALL, Recommendation
for Promotion to GS-14

1. It is recommended that Frederick C. Randall be promoted from GS-13 to GS-14. Subject is in Step 6 of his grade and has been a GS-13 since 1958. He entered on duty at the US Station in August 1965. A current Fitness Report is attached.

2. Subject's file indicates that he has been recommended for promotion five times: four times by his superiors in FE Division when he served in Japan, and once by the US Station in February 1966. While realizing that the 13 to 14 jump is traditionally difficult we feel that Subject's performance over the past year, when coupled with a consistently high calibre of work in previous years, deserves much-belated recognition in the form of a promotion. He continues to be responsible for the US Station's efforts to exploit the Far Eastern target, and his years of overseas experience against this target have been reflected in a realistic and imaginative approach to operations in the United States. His operational activity has required the handling of persons of varied nationality and stature, close contact with Headquarters representatives, liaison with the Washington Field Office of the FBI, and liaison with the US Air Force. His performance has been uniformly "Strong" and his handling of the HASHARK case has been outstanding. HASHARK, an Indonesian diplomat, has been a contact of the Agency for years, but it was not until his arrival in Washington and his handling by Subject that he began to produce solid intelligence on his own country. Subject's work on this case has received a well-deserved commendation from Headquarters.

Subject's excellent relations with colleagues in FE Division have been of considerable value in helping the US Station to adjust its operational activity in the FE field to current and changing requirements. He has clearly been performing at the GS-14 level for some time and we urge that this promotion request be favorably considered at the earliest possible meeting of your panel.

Section A.

SUBJECT : Frederick C. RANDALL - Recommendation for
Promotion to GS-14

1. It is recommended that Frederick C. Randall be promoted
   from GS-13 to G3-14. Subject is 39 years old and began his Agency
   career in 1951 as a GS-7. He has been a GS-13 since 1958. lie
   entered on duty at the US Station in August 1965. A current Fitness
   Report is attached.

2. As the attached Fitness Report indicates, Subject is a
   real plus for the US Station's efforts to exploit the Far Eastern
   target locally. flis years of experience in the handling of a
   variety of Oriental nationals abroad has alrewly resulted in a much
   more realistic approach to local FE targets than was the case before
   his arrival. In addition to the professional competence and arca
   knowledge which Subject brings to his present position, he has an
   imaginative approach to operational problems and a high enthusiasm
   for his work. llis excellent relations with colleagues within FE
   Division have been of conciderable value in helping the US Station
   adjust its operational activity in the FE field to current require-
   mente. One final--and strong--factor arguing for his promotion
   to G3-14 at this time: he has been in (rade eight years and has
   been recommended for promotion four times by previous supervisora
   when he was on PE Division rolls.

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion
of Mr. Frederick C. Randall
from GS-13 to GS-14

1. Since Mr. Frederick C. Randall joined the Agency in September 1951, he has served in Headquarters and the Field, where he worked primarily on Indonesian and Japanese affairs. He is currently assigned to Tokyo Station. Mr. Randall has been in grade as a GS-13 since September 1958. He has been recommended three times for promotion to GS 14 since September 1963 Mr. Randall is 33 years old.

2. Mr. Randall's primary duty at the Tokyo Station is Station PERAMPART responsibilities. These responsibilities are broad and highly important to all PSRAMPART relations throughout the Far East. Through Mr. Randall's intensive effort to strengthen and increase the Agency's role in the coordination of clandestine collection activities, he has been able to set a positive pattern of effective procedures for coordination of the military services' clandestine collection operations. These procedures are now emulated wherever possible throughout the Far East. Mr. Randall's tenacity and patience, based on solid operational Field and Headquarters' experience, have worked to a distinct advantage for the Agency in the PERAMPART field. Chief of Station, Tokyo, has stated that the vast improvement in the local coordination business has been in large part due to Mr. Randall's good work. Further, as a supervisor and a manager Mr. Randall has quite successfully handled from ten to fifteen subordinates in such diverse functions ad Central Registry for ad FE Establishment. Agency participation in a multi-agency CI Repository and Agency - run multi agency Central Carding facility.

3. During Mr. Randall's service at the Tokyo Station he has displayed his ability to carry on a variety of tasks.

responsibilities. In the most recent recommendation, Chief of Station, Tokyo emphasized that Mr. Randall a performance was characterized by exceptional proficiency in all respects of his assigned duties, and, therefore, endorsed his previous recommendation, and strongly recommended Mr. Randall's promotion to GS-14 at an early date.

4. In the most recent fitness report on Mr. Randall, he was rated over-all "Strong" and was given "Outstanding" for the Specific Duty Number One, "PBRAMPART Officer." In the narrative comment on Mr. Randall's performance the rating officer characterized Mr. Randall as capable, wasatile, and as having a fine career potential. Further, the rating officer stated that "because of his sound operational background, presence of mind, forceful reasoning, and the consideration the military therefore holde for him. Mr. Randall has been able to play a prime part in cur excellent PBRAMPART posture." The Chief of Station, in cominenting on the rating officer's fi ress repor: on Mr Randall, heartily concurred with the rating officer's description of Mr. Randall's performance and described Mr. Randall's contribution to the Station as being of the highest caliber.

5. In endorsing the recommendation of Chief of Station, Tokyo, I wish to add that, from my personal knowledge of Mr. Randa'ts performance, he te a thoroughly reliable ard compe.ent case cifiger. In watching the PBRAMPART activities during the past year, I strongly commend Tekyo Station and Mr. Randall for effecting certain improvements of what was already a rather efficient eccefination process. Mr. Randallis job is not always a happy one because he would rather be more active in elardestine operational activities; however, if Tokyo Station had a less experienced Pud less competent officer hand'ing the PBILAMPART coordination activities, this particularly important area of our responsibilities would certainly suffer. For this and the reasons set forth above, Mr. Randallis performance deservea recognition by a promotion to GS-14 at this time.

Promotion Recommendation - Hugh W. FILDERMAN

B. PSTS-1209, dated 15 January 1964

1. I wish to endorse my earlier recommendation that Hugh W. FILDERMAN be promoted from GS-12 to GS-14. Reference A discusses in detail FILDERMAN's responsibilities at the Tokyo Station and little more can be added to what has already been said.

2. FILDERMAN's Fitness Report for the reporting period ending 31 December 1963 which was forwarded with reference B, emphasizes that his performance is characterized by exceptional proficiency in all aspects of his assigned duties. I therefore strongly recommend his promotion to GS-14 at an early date.

His work with his military colleague in Tokyo is excellent and his unassuming patience based on solid experience continues to be a distinct advantage for the Agency in the PBRAMPART field in Japan. The vast improvement in the local coordination business has been in large part due to his good work. As a supervisor and manager he has quite successfully handled from ten to fifteen subordinates in such diverse functions as Station Central Registry, local TSD establishment, Agency participation in a multi agency CI repository, and an Agency run multi-agency central carding facility.

3. In his two years at the Tokyo Station, Mr. Randall has shown himself to be an adaptable officer and has carried out a variety of tasks in an exemplary manner. In his recommendation, Tokyo Chief of Station said Mr. Randall has demonstrated that he is ready to assume greater responsibility and that a commensurate increase in GS grade is in order.

4. In view of his performance in Tokyo and demonstrated maturity, motivation, and capacity to serve at the next grade level, I recommend that Mr. Randall be promoted to GS-14.

MEMORANDUM FOR: FE/Personnel

SUBJECT: Promotion of RANDALL, Frederick C.

1. Mr. Randall assumed his present duties as FI operations officer for Indonesia on 26 May 1954. Prior to that time he served as Chief, CE Unit, FE/S.

2. Mr. Randall has performed his duties as FI officer for Indonesia in an extremely satisfactory manner. The monthly letter of the Senior Representative to the Director has, without exception, stated that Headquarters support of the Djakarta Station has been efficient. Mr. Randall's performance is characterized by a high degree of industry and thoroughness. He has been described as one of those individuals to whom a supervisor can assign a task, and then turn to other matters with sure confidence that the job will be completed, to the last detail, and on time.

3. Mr. Randall has demonstrated clearly his growing ability to handle larger responsibilities. His transition from a CE Unit Chief's job to that of FI operations officer for the Indonesian Unit has been smooth. Once he learns a new technique or procedural method, Mr. Randall can put it into operation without further supervision.

4. Mr. Randall is strongly recommended for promotion to GS-12.

MEMORANTUM FOR: Frederick C. Randall

SUBJECT : Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category

REFERENCE : Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade

1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties, and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed (subject to your signature below) in the functional category W for Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are contained in the Evaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place- ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro- fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STUDY THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN CASE CAREFULLY.

2. In general, you should consider the following:

a. Categories are sharply defined. Competition is within categories, not between them. Thus, a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened by reclassifying it as B/OS.

b. A change in category after sustained performance in a different category may cause a temporary loss of momentum in your career advancement until you have demonstrated proficiency in your new assignment.

c. A category change should not be initiated for th period of a temporary, training or rotational assignment unless a permanent change of career track will follow.

3. If you believe that this is not the correct category for you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi- mates another category or because you have made a permanent change of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your home hase component, as appropriate, to a change of vour category. Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the Career Management Staff.

4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to your Personnel Officer.

I rate Mr. Randa "outstanding" for Duty Number 1 (his principal responsibility) for this period. He had done an exceptional job of supervising, motivating, training and guiding his group in a remorseless and pressure-laden atmosphere, requiring both close attention to detail and constant altertness to broad operational and policy implications. The workload is larger and more complicated than anything I know of handled by any line operational officer with equivalent grade and responsibility. The preceding two fitness reports describe well the nature of the job. It remains only to be noted that Mr. Randall is the perfect man for the job, combining a remarkable match of leadership, operational savvy, legal and policy awareness and, perhaps most important, negotiating ability with both the Agency lawyers and legislative counsels, and the operating divisions in a bizarre situation that completely transcends the DO's need-to-know practices (Top Secret and compartmented, bigotted information must be reviewed) and yet requires the protection of our sources and methods. Dedicated, discreet, smart, and honest, Mr. Randall is very likely one of very few DO officers of his grade who could have handled this job from scratch, done so with virtually flawless output, and created a body of judgments and advice that is trusted, proven and amounts to de facto 10 policy on how to protect our secrets. Mr. Randall also has major planning obligations within INS, serving as a voting member of the PMC and three times a week with Chief, IMS and other (continued)

I agree with the letter ratings and the parrative comments above, particularly those In paragraph 1 of the narrative.

Mr. Randall is a dedicated, forceful, purposeful, dependable, disciplined officer. Although his personal preference would have been to do something else, he effectively manages and leads the Freedom of Information and Privacy Group of IMS--demonstrating a self reliant style which has brought great credit to work in this area in the DO and to himself.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS - continued

Randall, Frederick

Group chiefs in a broad review of disparate IMS operations: computers, information management planning for the DO and its current services. He is articulate and effective in presenting views from the IMS/FPG vantage, but at this level, I want to see more concern about the people and activities of companion IMS elements, more brainstorming of common problems. He is the least active of the four group chiefs in this area, although he has the inquisitiveness and intellect to contribute importantly in cross-discipline problems. I find no weakness here, but Mr. Randall's contributions here do not measure up comparatively to his exceptional performance in all other areas.

In these other areas, covering duties 3 and 4, Mr. Randall and his group stimulated, staffed out and justified three remarkably successful policy changes: a Presidential statement that sources and methods information need not be classified to be protected; a DCI policy that DO records *ipso facto* are not releasable (despite an OGC opinion to the contrary), and a policy allowing employees access to their files without going through the FOIA or Privacy Act folderol. While not individual accomplishments by Mr. Randall, they bespeak Even the leadership and guidance he gave, and they are typical of the kind of case officer professionalism he has and we have needed to help protect agents, operations and officers from exposure. I do thìnk it is sad to have to divert good Do talent to disclosure law problems; but if we must, then Mr. Randall's experience and abilities have counted a great deal in such successes we have had in keeping our secrets.

Mr. Randall's fitness reporting is accurate and fair. Per HR 20-20, it is noted for the record that Mr. Randall displays appropriate concern in equal employment opportunity areas: women comprise more than half of his group. He has three minority officers. Levels of responsibility here are above Agency norm.

REVIEWING OFFICIAL'S COMMENTS - continued

for this experienced supervisor. He has demonstrated his versatility and commitment by doing a job for four years that probably few other bo ops officers/managers would or could do as well as he has. For the good of his morale. the interest of his further development and in the interest of the Directorate, ho has carned a change.

The merger of units which created the Information Services Staff brought Mr. Randall and his staff under my supervision for the first time. Prior to that we had been colleagues in Services Staff, whose chief wrote Mr. Randall's Fitness Report. No change in function accompanied the change in organization, however, and the praise contained in those earlier reports could be echoed here.

During 1977, Mr. Randall and his group have continued to render this Directorate outstanding service in an arena where there is little glory but the constant threat of disaster. In the preparation of materials for release under FOIA, the Privacy Act or E.0. 11652, the researcher treads a fine, barely visible line between protection of operational secrets and revelation of material properly releasable under the law. He is denied the easy choice of over-protection because each decision is subject to the scrutiny of the courts, and the Agency's credibility is on the line each time a judge challenges a deletion or the denial of a document. (That credibility is apparently quite high in the courts. We have yet to be reversed in appeals cases on information denied by PIAG on grounds of classification or sources/methods.) The research on which we rely is almost autonomous; reviews of finished cases are necessarily Limited and (cont'd

I think it is important first to echo the remarks in the last paragraph of the narrative above. Mr. Randall is an exceptionally proficient performer in a position that few other DO officers want to occupy. The DO is fortunate to have a person of his caliber handling FOIA and related matters.

As I see his performance, Mr. Randall has made a significant effort in advancing national intelligence objectives by doing everything possible to protect DO "sources and methods." He has represented us exceedingly well in this area and as a result, to his credit, little has gotten away through the FOIA channel. The way things are organized,

cursory, and from the beginning there has been a high premium on both technical accuracy and sound substantive judgment. As Mr. Randall himself noted in a report on his deputy, we have an enviable record as far as "flaps" are concerned; in a situation fraught with danger of inappropriate release of information we have had only five cases where release has led to embarrassment -- out of 7,000 "possibles." Mr. Randall, with typical modesty, uses the statistic in praise of others; I choose to use it to praise him. The Group's record to date is nothing short of astonishing, and Mr. Randall can take great pride in his team's accomplishments.

He has built an extremely able and dedicated team, and he is as quick as anyone I know to ascribe to individual members of that team credit for actions, ideas or progress. They respond to his fairness with loyalty and affection, and their morale in the face of constant harrassment and frustration is testimony to his leadership.

New responsibilities for support to the Office of General Counsel were added to PIAG's burdens this year. Mr. Randall opposed the move and argues (and lobbied) intelligently to preclude it, to no avail. It is to his credit that, having urged a different course of action, he set about to ensure that the 'unpopular new function received the same careful attention which has been the hallmark of PIAG's other work. As a consequence, our OGC-related efforts, which are very demanding and time-consuming, have the PIAG stamp of excellence on them.

Mr. Randall created the system he manages, and continues to seek ways to improve upon it. Our move to an automated index of reviewed and released documents was urged and supported by Mr. Randall, and he has been equally supportive of a new branch chief's efforts to restructure our Initial Review process. He is also quick to see and to comment on the way our efforts affect larger Agency and government equities, and vice versa.

During this year his responsibilities were broadened by the addition of our Declassification Review Branch to his Group, a reflection of our recognition of the inevitable relationship between scheduled declassification and selective declassification and release under FOIA/PA/E.O. 11652. This Branch will shortly be absorbed by the new Records Review Branch of the DDA, but PIAG will continue to be the focal point for policy formulation on declassification of DO records.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS - cont'd

Mr. Randall has expressed to me his concern about what may be viewed as a drop in his rating from my predecessor's "0" to my "S." I have assured him, and assure the reader, that this change signals no diminution in his performance or effectiveness, but rather a personal inclination to use "Outstanding" very rarely. The narrative comments above should clearly attest to that fact that I view Mr. Randall's performance as very strong, bordering on Outstanding. The Agency and the DO have been fortunate to have a man of this caliber in charge of PIAG.

## REVIEWING COMMENTS - cont'd

Mr. Randall is one of the key policy makers in this area. His policies have stood the test up to now as our excellent record in the courts attests.

Having said this, it should be noted that Mr. Randall's numerous accomplishments are partly because the job was there to be created. Within the DO he cut the path which is now followed when handling FOIA matters. He has corrected and improved upon that path several times over. Thus, the time is coming for him to be given a change in assignment; an opportunity to use his managerial and supervisory skills elsewhere. He will have been in his present assignment three years in March 1978. One grows stale reviewing, sanitizing and making judgment calls in the FOIA arena day after day. Mr.. Randall isn't stale yet but we should not wait until he reaches that stage to give him a new area in which to work.

My qualitative assessment and comments in Fred's February 1976 Fitness Report apply equally today; in fact, they fall short, in view of the quantitative and administrative changes of the past year.

The news headlines, the new oversight demands, an increasingly sophisticated FOIA requester group and judiciary, plus a highly organized hostile element, epitomized by the Center for National Security Studies, has made the PICG function all the more significant. Cases in litigation involving DDO materials now number 58 and the appeal pattern is now running 1:2 (i.e., one appeal for two initial requests, with subsequent litigation--anticipating deep analysis and Deputy Director-level review) compared to 1:3 last year. Appeal-level analysis is much more time-consuming, hence the backlog reduction process suffers; hence, overtime and fire-fighting remain the norm. Double-encumbered personnel detailing has raised the on-board PICG total from the 18 stated in last year's FR to 25. The managerial task of motivating workers in this continuously grinding and frustrating environment was harder this year, yet was met by Fred with the same qualities as those which led his people to write

me an unsolicited letter of appreciation for his efforts as their supervisor. We have all felt that one burns out in this kind of thing after about a year and a half; Fred and some of the first people to come aboard are a bit ground down, but, if anything, the quality has improved--witness the fact that we have yet to lose a case in court or to be forced to release a document we thought should be denied.

Adding to the complexity of Fred's life during this period, was increasing involvement in non-FOIA litigation support, (e.g., ITT/Chile, the Socialist Workers Party case, etc.) both to me and to SA/DDO/O. Additional administrative complexity results from my having changed staffs, while being asked to retain the DDO Information Review Officer function. Hence, split daily support to me as well as periodic support to SA/DDO/O, poses a potentially ticklish situation with Fred's organizational supervisor who is Chief, ISS. In fact, Fred walks this tightrope quite well.

Finally, Fred has persistently tried to convince others that there is a critical need for a centralized capability to assess the total Agency impact of decentralized information release, whether to FOIA, congressional, judicial, news media or other non-intelligence requesters. His efforts are about to bear fruit, since this will be an EAG agenda item next month.

Whether it's bringing his professional overseas background to bear on the analysis for release process; protecting sources and methods in the now "open sunshine" context; trying to save resources and ensure efficient procedures; deal effectively and impressively with senior officers in this Agency and others; or supervise a collection of dedicated and hardworking people, firmly but with good humor and understanding, Fred has done an Outstanding job. He will be very hard to replace, and yet, he should move on.

Mr. Randall supervises the unit responsible for developing the DDO answer to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act requests, both at the initial request level and, increasingly, at the appeal and litigation levels. His organization is still less than one year old but has gone through several growth surges as the public reacted to the past year's publicity about CIA, demanding great amounts of information. Last March, Randall and his secretary played the role, then the T/O went from 6 to 12 to its current level of 18. In this period, initial requests received by the Agency reached nearly 10,000; appeals number about 300, and there are currently 31 cases in litigation, the DPO being involved in 27. Much overtime is the norm, in a backlogged, firefighting environment.

This has been uncharted sailing. Years of conditioning in sources and methods pro- tection made analysis of DDO materials for release agonizing. The Watergate and Congressional investigation experience produced over-reaction tendencies in the Agency. As the individual responsible for releasing or denying DDO materials in the first instance, and subsequently defending DDO decisions in affidavits and adversarial oral depositions, I not only attest to the excellence of Mr. Randall's analysis and recommendations, but gratefully thank those who brought him to the job in the first instance. Frustrating and often demoralizing as his job is, he does it with real

professionalism and seems to have been made for it. As I said in a memo last October which resulted in a QSI for him, in spite of the ambiguity of the guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines, very large volume of work and cultural trauma generated by the Acts, his performance has been Outstanding.

Earlier fitness reports, in a different context, stated or implied some reservation about his energy or initiative or independent action. I can't imagine that we're talking about the same man. Close to 95% of the mass of Agency FOIA receipts have involved the DDO. I know all of the persons involved in other directorates and said, only 6 months into this year, that Fred was head and shoulders above the others, combining professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills, tough-mindedness and pragmatism in sources and methods protection. The suggested policy, strongly influenced implementation, and debated, usually successfully, with the lawyers, with DDO branch, division and staff chiefs, with other Agency contacts and others above his current grade level--all with a sustaining sense of humor.

As to management of his unit: he has consistently resisted empire- building opportunities, trying to keep his staff small. When growth was inevitable, he concentrated on quality in personnel selected for this atypical DDO work rather than accepting the short fix to the statistical backlog problem because routine or "passable" effort is not good enough in litigation. The best reflection of his managerial ability can be seen in an unsolicited testimony from his staff which I have attached to this report to make it a part of the official record; it is the first of its kind to come to my attention in my 23 plus years in the Agency. (If some jaded cynics in these days of non-credibility doubt the spontaneity and true feeling of Mr. Randall's staff in this action, and one or two of my staff have, I can only feel sad for them. This is a breath of fresh air to me.)

Randall has made a singularly impressive shift in direction, has changed career category and, in my judgment, has unqualifiedly demonstrated his command of the position he holds. I have recommended recognition of that fact.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Services Staff
SUBJECT: Fred Randall, C/DDO/PIC

1. This memorandum is intended to state what we, the staff of DDO/PIC, think of our Chief, Mr. Fred Randall. Mr. Randall is not aware of this memorandum.

2. We believe he is outstanding as a manager and fellow worker! His sensitive understanding of human relationships is balanced by a no-nonsense firmness to get the job done. Using extraordinary patience, brains, tact, and diplomacy, along with long hours and weekend time, he has set an example for his entire staff. Mr. Randall's deep knowledge of operations, his grasp of the implications of past operations on current activity, his determination to protect the Agency and the DDO from the devastating impact of unwarranted and unauthorized release of information, and his Judgement of the fine line between what should and should not be released under appropriate law and policy, have formed a major line of protection for the USG and the Agency.

3. He has not hesitated to make decisions, nor to disagree when he felt disagreement warranted. A strong aversion to pyramid building has underlined his cost- consciousness to get the most done with the least amount of expenditures. Yet, his determination and firmness are based upon an open, objective mind, willing to listen to different views, and to change his position if he is convinced of the need for change.

4. His strong desire to aid employees in career development is re-inforced by concrete actions, positive suggestions, defined tasks, and frequent checks to assess the quality and quantity of work product.

5. The nature of the task assigned to DDO/PIC includes the word by word review of thousands of pages of documents. The impact on the Agency, and the USG, of unauthorized disclosure of secrets, adds to the weight of constant decision making, and to the strain and tension of defending a crucial perimeter. And this perimeter is under an almost daily attack of erupting crises. Mr. Randall's dedication and superior ability in handling an onerous, difficult, and complex job, filled with frustrations that would dismay and discourage others, has been truly outstanding.

6. Mr. Randall has had his finger in the dike for an incredibly long time. He has been operating in a hazardous, high pressure environment, fraught with penalties if he does not make the right decisions, and little recognized when he does. Yet, his common sense decisions have been accepted, and have become policy-- policy that ordinarily is made by very senior super-grade officers of the Agency. An assignment in DDO/PIC can burn out rapidly many competent individuals. Fred Randall is still going strong, and continuing to do an outstanding job!

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Mr. Frederick C. Randall, GS-14/7

1. This report is submitted as part of a package suggesting that Mr. Randall be awarded a QSI for his performance since becoming the DDO Freedom of Information Officer in February of this year. In this context, it is not appropriate that he see and sign this memorandum, since I want this to be a surprise. Nor, it seems, is it necessary to have a Reviewing Official for this interim report; the DDO has suggested, in commenting on my out-of-cycle recommendation of 8 August. 75 for Mr. Randall's promotion, that a memorandum be submitted recommending a QSI at this time.

2. I consider Mr. Randall's performance as DDO/FIO (now DDO/PIC, for Privacy Act and FOIA Coordinator) to be Outstanding. As I have said elsewhere, he is, in my view, the most impressive of all the Agency F10's combining DDO professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills and an informed, tough-minded approach toward sources and methods protection. I have received considerable laudatory comment about his work from OGC, OLC, O/DDA and within the DO.

3. From a one-man operation with secretary, the FOIA activity expanded in four months to an approved 1/0 of 7, with a pending request for 5 more, and the possibility of further increases depending on public reaction to the Privacy Act and the amount of litigation that develops. Fred has done an excellent job of selecting his staff for what is an often frantic, frustrating and long-houred environment; he also manages them well, with humor and compassion and with high analysis and output standards. He is conscious of cost, particularly in human effort, in this exercise and of the need for balance in the application of secrecy criteria in today's environment. I am, obviously, impressed and pleased with his assistance, and feel comfortably supported by his group's efforts in avoiding or preparing for litigation actions in FOIA and Privacy Act cases.

(Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report - Frederick C. Randall)

during the rating period. Whereas I had indicated in his last fitness report a need for him to be more demanding in challenging faulty proposals or resolving problems which come to him at his Branch Chief level, he now exerts a good degree of initiative in independent action and offers good completed staff work to the Division Chief level for scrutiny. Mr. Randall's branch encompasses four (4) busy Bases (Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco). He keeps effectively abreast of the operational developments coming out of each Base and represents this Division very persuasively in obtaining good guidance messages going back out to the Bases. He has also kept himself well informed on the Management by Objectives targets assigned to each of his Bases where a total of about forty (40) personnel are assigned, and has been strong in supporting his Bases' efforts to achieve these objectives.

Mr. Randall has matured nicely as a manager these past months and is on top of the many administrativo, personnel and operational support problems which are of a frequently recurring nature in our type operational activity. He is also a good team player, has the best interests of this Division at heart, and gives thoroughly of himself in his job. He has worked hard in bringing himself up to his present level of performance which I appraise as an unqualified "Strong".

# REVIEWING OFFICIALS COMMENTS (Frederick C. Randall)

I concur generally with the comments of the rating officer. I believe Mr. Randall has shown improvement in his handling of his Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown greater initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however, I would still like to see a somewhat greater and quicker recognition on Mr. Randall's part of operational problem areas. Granted that this is a talent that is frequently hard to develop, it is nonetheless, essential for all Branch Chiefs in this Division to achieve a high degree of operational perspicacity. Mr. Randall has the ability and needs only additional experience to improve his focus on the operational targeting efforts of his respective Bases. He is a thoughtful and considerate supervisor, respected by his subordinates and he represents the Division very well indeed. Mr. Randall's career would be enhanced were he in a position to accept a field assignment which would get him into direct operational contact, i. e., recruiting and handling agents. Unfortunately, for family medical reasons he will apparently be confined to the Headquarters area for an indefinite period. On balance, I consider him to be a good Branch Chief who willingly works long hours and does his job well.

Mr. Randall has served under me for slightly more than three months and had just taken over his new position duties when I arrived for duty in this Division. During this brief period, however, he has displayed considerable dedication and interest in applying himself to his newly assigned tasks as Chief of one of our three operating branches. This branch which comprises Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Atlanta Bases, is shaping up nicely thus far under this supervision, and appears well organized to support the four bases in the months ahead. He could at times be a bit more demanding in challenging some aspects of proposals or problems at the Branch level instead of allowing them to pass on up to the Division Chief level for decision, but it is hoped that he will gradually develop his style in this direction as he becomes more accustomed to his expanded responsibilities as

Branch Chief. The thorough test of his managerial skills, however, will occur in this upcoming period when all the Bases in his Branch become operationally active on a broad front and will require a continuing high quality of super- vision, guidance and support from the Branch Chief's office. I would rate his performance to date as an overall "Strong".

3. Reviewing Official's Comments:

I concur generally with the above rating. I also observed in the early days of Mr. Randall's assignment as Branch Chief, that his per- formance could certainly have been stronger. It took him somewhat longer than I had anticipated to really take charge of his Branch. However, I feel that as he has continued in this assigninent he has made very definite progress. He is now generally well informed on the operational activities taking place in his area and has begun to exercise a greater degree of initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross his desk. Had I been the rating officer I probably would have given Mr. Randall a somewhat lower, more qualified "Strong" rating. If he continues to improve in the months ahead as he has in the past several, I believe he can earn an unqualified "Strong" rating for this performance.

In the less than six months since my preparation of the previous report on Mr. Randall, his overall performance, has continued strong. He has effectively continued to provide the day-to-day operational support for the FR Bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco and the two (soon to be three) singleton officers in the Northwest, Colorado and Arizona. The level and complexity of the operational support and guidance which he has provided with skill, sensitivity and humanness has continued uniformly high.

Mr. Randall has again effectively trained a new Intelligence Analyst with no loss of efficiency or responsiveness to the ever-increasing field requirements.

Mr. Randall has been under my supervision for 28 months as the San Francisco/ Los Angeles Desk officer and has continued successfully to meet the challenges of increased responsibility. It is now planned to appoint him as Branch Chief to be responsible for the Bases in Boston and Atlanta as well as Los Angeles and San Francisco. The increase in complexity of this new assignment for him will be heightened by the assignment of additional operational personnel in three of his four Bases, which will materially add to the demanding workload of his Branch. We are confident he will be able to meet the challenge of these added responsibilities

Mr. Randall continues to exercise the responsibility of providing the day-to-day operational support for the FR Bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The comments that were made in the previous fitness report bear repetition. In any other Division the backstopping of two Bases, which are Stations in all but name, would involve at least an entire branch and all the supervisory responsibility that such support entails rather than a single officer with an Intelligence Analyst. Mr. Randall does all of this and has continued to do it well. During the year both Bases have increased substantially in size and in degree and complexity of the operational activities there. He has supported both Bases exceptionally well.

In addition to carrying on the full-time responsibility for both Bases he has continued to demonstrate a willingness and a sensitivity to increase the effectiveness of his Intelligence Analyst, who has now gone on to a sensitive SB position with additional responsibility, by careful tutorial training and guidance. He has then been called upon to train a second Intelligence Analyst quickly and did so while maintaining a high degree of responsiveness to the continued demands of the two Bases.

Mr. Randall continued to turn in a "Strong" performance and is held in high

I fully concur in the overall "Strong" rating given to Mr. Randall. During this reporting period he has certainly performed in an extremely able manner. When Mr. Randall was first assigned to our Division Headquarters component, it was my distinct impression that he was very definitely lacking in energy. However, as time has progressed and he has become more experienced in our mode of opera- tions, I am pleased to note that he pursues his operational objectives with very commendable energy and vigor, Mr. Randall writes well and quickly. I think his operational judgment is good. I also believe that his strengths lie in the Headquarters or Staff end of the Clandestine Service rather than in direct agent recruiting and

Mr. Randall has the responsibility of providing the day to day operational support to FR Bases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Both bases have increased substantially in size during the past year to where there are presently six senior case officers and an intelligence assistant in Los Angeles and ten senior case officers and an intelligence analyst in San Francisco all generating significant operational activity requiring substantive guidance, management and organizational initiative of the highest order. In any other Division the back-stopping of an element of this size and complexity would involve an entire branch and all the supervisory responsibility that goes with it rather than a single officer and an intelligence analyst. In the FR Division the decision was made to keep the Headquarters complement small and to do a job with carefully selected experienced and skilled senior operations officers who, based on their own field and personal experience, are able to press the right buttons to evoke appropriate responses from the various area divisions and staffs and to provide practical guidance on their own.

In exercising this function, Mr. Randall has continued to demonstrate those critical qualities of energy, loyalty and dedication. He cares. He is concerned with end results as well as the means by which the end is reached. He is Continued

I think the narrative portion of the above rating is a thoughtful and accurate account of a conscientious officer's performance. However, I believe the letter grades are a little on the high side as I feel a precise letter description would be in the overall "S-" or "P+" category. Since I have great confidence in the rating officer, I am prepared to defer to his judgment as stated above, I think it might be noted that Mr. Randall has indeed come along very nicely in his present assignment. I believe he is eminently well qualified to perform his current job, I believe that his talents and experience are better utilized in his current assignment then they would be in a more direct operational, i.e., agent handling and

intellectually honest and has developed his organizational imagination to where he is able to identify the potential operational advantages and disadvantages on which he bases his recommendations for appropriate action.

Mr. Randall is a humanist, careful and considerate in his dealings with others, firm when necessary, scrupulously fair, with a down-to-earth approach and a sensitiveness to the nuances of the interrelations of major headquarters components all of which contribute to his Strong performance.

Mr. Randall unfailingly demonstrates a wide ranging intellectual awareness and curiosity, and is able to refine and use these in his approach to problem solving.

Mr. Randall writes well and succintly. He continues to turn in a Strong performance and is held in high regard by the Base officers with whom he regularly deals.

recruiting situation. On balance, I have been pleased with Mr. Randall's performance and feel that he is doing a good job.

As a final statement, it is my opinion that Mr. Randall does not have the requisite GS-14 convertibility from his present desk assignment to that of an active field case officer charged with the recruitment of agents, This is not stated in denigration of Mr. Randall for there is clearly a need and a place for the type of talents he possesses. I think we have found that place in the job that he is now performing.

Mr. Randall continues to view his responsibilities with enthusiasm and serious concern. Given the complexities of dealing with every area division and staff within DDP on cover matters, academic approvals, targetting against foreign nationals, recruitment of support assets, secure operational approaches, etc. --I would characterize his overall performance as evincing exceptional proficiency. This was accomplished in a period which saw both Bases increase their striking power numerically rather significantly. In the ultimate, the real test of performance is in recruitment of foreign nationals. While recruitment is not part of Mr. Randall's duties there is no doubt that his support of the two Bases contributed to the highest record of recruitment that these Bases had as compared to any other year. At the same time, he consciously maintained an excellent balance in the outgo of funds for operational purposes. He is held in high regard by both Base Chiefs. Since much of the routine desk work is done by his Intal Assistant, it is a tribute to his supervisory capability that this service maintains a high rate of efficiency despite the significant increase in work, and the fact that during this perod there were three different intel assistants. Since the supervisor began phasing out of his job for several months prior to 31 March, a-rather conscious decision was made to have Mr. Randall in fact assume some of the responsibility of the Branch Chief. Not only has he taken these added tasks willingly and with the confidence of DO's management, but he has performed superbly.

I concur, generally, with the narrative portion of this report, However, I feel that it is somewhat overstated. Specifically, I would not rate his performance of Duty No. 1 as "outstanding", rather I would rate it "strong". I consider Mr. Randall a capable officer, but feel his overall performance falls somewhere on the border of a "low strong" and a "high proficient". Let me hasten to add that I am fully satisfied with Mr. Randall's performance in his present assignment, and I have every confidence that he will continue to do a completely satisfactory job.

This is Mr. Randall's first fitness report for a Headquarters assignment following nearly 9 years in the field, of which over 4 years were at the Washington Base. Even with this field background of operational activity in the USA, Subject finds himself faced with a different kind of target situation than he had at the Washington Base. Since the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bases have little in terms of a large PCS diplomatic community (as compared with Washington), their targetting for the most part is aimed at those foreign nationals, designated as important targets by the area divisions, who are graduate students in US universities

The reporting period (of 3 1/2 months) is too short a time to give a fair evaluation of Subject's performance. This much can be said, Subject has undertaken his responsibilities with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. He has made mistakes but these were "par for the course" and none that were not retriyable and correctable. Given the way he has jumped into the fray, I would characterize his overall performance as evincing exceptional proficiency. He is conscious of and maintains a good balance in the outgo of funds for field operational purposes. He is a good supervisor. He has more to absorb and digest in terms of the : myriad problems facing an officer giving total support to two Bases. He has to date made an auspicious beginning. As a desk officer, agent recruitment is not part of his duties.

This case officer is intelligent and articulate, and is capable of dealing with equanimity with intellectuals, particularly academicians. He has had sufficient experience in field assignments to have developed an area of expertise. His operational and intelligence reporting is organized, coherent and thorough.

He was one of the few officers within the Base who made agent recruitments during the period. One of these was essentially routine, through no fault of the rated officer, but in another case the officer skillfully used an imaginative' cover, as he also did in a third recruitment case which had the additional complexity of WODISH involvement. In all these cases the officer illustrated his ability to plan, organize and carry through an operation to a successful conclusion.

If I were to fault this officer I would say that he is not essentially an activist, and that ho lacks the force to be a notable recruiter. Conversely he does possess the sense of caution which slows down recruitment but also saves mistakes.

Chief of Base

John G. Shaffer, Jr.

(Signed in Pseudo on Form 45a)

I am somewhat surprised that the rater gives an overall rating of "P" for Subject's performance when in the rater's own words "he was one of the few officers within the Base who made agent recruitments." In another recent fitness report on another officer who has since been transferred and whose activities for the year have been rather minimal, i. e., no recruitments and rather marginal agent handling, the rater gave him the overall rating of "S". Apparently the rater prefers a "social animal." The fact remains that Subject, while giving the outward impression of being low-key was indeed an active and thorough case officer and was given special assignments because of his dependability and capabilities. I would have given Subject a higher rating.

In addition, as is true of all officers at the Base, he is responsible for contacting and developing American and foreign nationals in the Washington area with the capability of producing intelligence and operational information of interest to WOFIRM. His forte continues to be the exploitation of existing assets rather than the recruitment of new agents, particularly among foreign nationals. However, the lack of a good access cover has hampered his recruitment activity against foreign nationals to some extent. He performs his supervisory functions well. He has asked for transfer to WCROMP and the rating officer endorses this request, feeling that Subject's high degree of expertise in the FE area would well qualify him for work of a substantive nature in the WOROMP. Subject is cost conscious and his accounting for official funds is prompt and accurate. No training is contemplated or recommended at this time.

Subject is the FE "referent" for the Washington Base and, as such, has the responsibility for coordinating all work against the FE targets as well as himself handling the bulk of operational activity in this category. In addition, as is true of all officers at the Base, he is responsible for contacting and developing American and foreign nationals in the Washington area with the capability of producing operational and intelligence information on other areas of priority interest to WOFIRM. His forte continues to be the exploitation of existing assets rather than the recruitment of new agents, particularly among foreign nationals. He writes well and is orderly and professional in his approach to operations. His work on the highly involved and sensitive WUWORTHY case is cited in this regard. Although he continues to feel a bit unsure of himself in operational areas other than FE (to a degree not warranted by his performance, as the WUWORTHY case shows) he is improving in this regard and is on his way to bringing his operational activity in other areas up to the level of his performance on Asian targets. He performs his supervisory functions well. He is very cost conscious and his accounting for official funds is prompt and accurate. No particular training is contemplated or recommended at this time.

State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify explain findings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

Subject has Washington Base responsibility for allegations directed against FE Division targets. He continues to do an excellent job of exploiting his foreign and domestic contacts for operational and intelligence purposes. His patience, skill and sophistication in the handling of sensitive oriental agents and agent candidates has meant a continual increase in the calibre of Base operations against these targets. He has developed a Burmese official (WUTHAL) to the point of giving useful information on his Embassy and his Government's intentions at a time when it is difficult to have any contact with Burmese at all. The intelligence reporting from his other agents--particularly WUFLY and WUSHARK--has been impressive and he has talked WUSHARK into attempting to get a posting to Peking.

He has, on his own, developed a solid academic cover and has used it to advantage on occasions when his official cover was not appropriate. He is very cost conscious and his handling of confidential funds is characterized by good judgement and prompt accountings. He has excellent working relations with his colleagues at the Base and in Headquarters.

Subject has US Station responsibility for Far Eastern operations. He continues to do an excellent job of exploiting his foreign and American contacts for operational and intelligence objectives. His handling of a difficult penetration agent in the Indonesian Embassy (HASHARK) has received high praise in formal traffic from Headquarters. A previously unproductive Station agent (WUALLOY/1) has improved his reporting and his access since Subject has taken him over, and was the Station's only agent at the Havana Tri-Continent Conference. Subject's handling of a potential penetration operation against the Indonesian Embassy showed balanced judgment and a good appreciation of the CE and FI factors involved. His knowledge of Far Eastern politics, geography and contemporary history is encyclopedic, and his handling of orientals in the USA confirms the high marks given him by FE supervisors in earlier reports. He has begun to use his cover in initiating new contacts within the diplomatic community, as well as continuing to assess several WUENVOY candidates within the academic community. His handling of confidential funds is characterised by good judgment and prompt accountings. He has excellent working relations with his colleagues at the Station and in Headquarters.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

NAME : Frederick Randall 012170

REPORTING PERIOD: 21 June 1965 - 31 December 1965

DATE OF BIRTH : 28 October 1926

SEX : Male

GRADE : GS-13

SD : D

OFFICIAL TITLE : Operations Officer

ASSIGNMENT : DDP/DOD/USS

CURRENT STATION : Washington, D. C.

APPOINTMENT : Career

TYPE OF REPORT : Annual

Subject returned to the U.S. in August 1955, but did not begin substantive work in the Non-Orbit Group at the Station until late September 1965. Much of the time since his arrival has been spent on becoming acquainted with the work of the Station and in casing the operational possibilities among the FE Division targets in Washington. We, accordingly, prefer to delay until April 1966 submission of a formal Fitness Report which, hopefully, will give a more precise and meaningful evaluation of his performance than is now possible.

Subject's predecessor left him with only one "agent" - and an unproductive one at that - plus one or two equally unproductive "contacts". Subject is thus starting essentially from scratch. He is making commendable inroads into the Indonesian student community and we hope that he will also soon get in some solid work on the Indonesian and Burmose diplomatic targets.

We note that Fitness Reports submitted on Subject just before his departure from Tokyo gave him high marks for his operational support work in Japan and regrettel tant the situation in Tokyo did not permit him to be given as much active operational work as he wished. He will certainly


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 181

RANDALL, Frederick C.
have the opportunity for aggressive agent operations in Washington, and
is aware that this activity will not be limited to targets of interest
to FE Division, but will give him the chance to participate actively in
the planning and execution of operations directed at the recruitment
and/or handling of other priority targets as well.

No training is recommended at this time beyond the Clandestine
Service Review Course which Subject will take in March 1966.

Subject exercises good judgement in his handling of official funds
and his accountings are prompt.

He gets along well with his colleagues at the Station and in
Headquarters.

Subject performs his principal duty -- handling Agreed Activities -- in outstanding fashion. In this field he represents not only this Station but other FE Stations and KUBARK to the U.S. military. Because of his sound operational background, presence of mind, forceful reasoning, and the consideration the military therefore holds for him, Subject has been able to play a prime part in our excellent Agreed Activities posture out here. As a result much valuable time -- and therefore money -- that would otherwise have had to be spent in negotiations with the U.S. military has been saved both by this Station and other KUBARK elements. For this reason the Station is recommending by separate correspondence that Subject be awarded a Quality Step Increase.

Subject also performs his other duties in strong fashion. He is capable, versatile, and continues to show fine career potential.

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

This officer has brought to bear on his current assignment his varied organization experiences in a manner which brings credit to himself as well as to the organization. His unstinting giving of himself is an outstanding attribute. The trials and tribulations of PERAMPART in an area traditionally hostile to the whole concept have made his assignment particularly challenging, always difficult, and infrequently satisfying; but he sticks to it with firm determination. His supervisory role of our Central Registry frequently catches him in the cross currents of opposing interests and priorities but he successfully calms such troubled waters. While a part of his PERAMPAKT activities this officer's supervision of the CCFJ, an intelligence community pooled activity for agent checks, has been excellent. Finally, his task under SD 4 is largely a handholding one but one which requires large amounts of tact, patience, and goodwill. There is no other Station officer performing comparable duties with whon this officer can be compared.

SECTION IV

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not to be unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. These categories are divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

Frederick P. Randall

Subject has performed his duties as listed in Section (7) in a very creditable manner.
The monthly letter of the Senior Representative to the Director has, without exception, stated that Headquarters support of the Djakarta Station has been more than adequate.
Since Subject is a relative newcomer to his present position and has had no field experience, he occasionally is hesitant to initiate action. However, he is clearly willing to assume responsibility when he is sure of his footing, and it will be only a question of time before he is willing and able to act in full capacity in all situation.

POOR:
A few of the major objectives have been achieved but the student's performance is so limited that he would have difficulty in performing satisfactory work in this area or successfully completing training at a more advanced level.

FAILURE:
The individual failed to meet either the primary or the secondary objectives and represents an extremely poor risk for performing work in this area of being advanced training.

SUBJECT: Letter of Commendation

I have been advised that in connection with the Westinghouse FOIA litigation case you were a member of a team of employees who worked the weekend of 21-22 April to meet a court-imposed deadline. Your devotion to duty as demonstrated by giving of your time to process material for this case is most praiseworthy.

Dear Frederick,

Please accept my appreciation for an assignment well done as a member of the FY 1979 GS-13 Personnel Evaluation Board.

Your full-time service with the Board represents a major contribution to the Directorate's program of personnel assessment and management. Your recommendations for promotion, career development, and other matters have been very helpful.

I believe you will find on return to your regular duties that this time spent with the Board has broadened and sharpened your own focus on the personnel aspects of Agency management. I think it will make you appreciate more than ever our needs for carefully and candidly written appraisals of employees.

Sincerely,

John N. McMahon
Deputy Director for Operations

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chiefs of DO Staffs and Divisions

FROM: William F. Donnelly
Chief, Information Services Staff

SUBJECT: Commendation

1. On 9 March 1978, the CIA Information Review Committee took note of the excellent work done by the Directorate of Operations in processing requests under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The Deputy Director for Operations was present, as were other Deputy Directors.

2. I would like to add my endorsement to that of the CIA/IRC and to commend all those who were/are involved in the processing of FOIA and PA requests. Although complex and time consuming, these tasks are obligatory by federal laws. In meeting the intent of the law, a difficult balance must be achieved. On the one hand, the rights of our citizens must be respected. On the other, the obligation of the Agency to protect its sources and methods must be honored. In meeting these rights and obligations, the Directorate of Operations has handled some 16,000 requests to date. In all instances where a requester has gone to the federal courts, the DO has never lost a case based upon our exemptions for sources and methods or classification.

3. This outstanding result stems directly from the Very high quality of professionalism, dedication, excellent judgements by those involved, and close cooperation within the DO. These characteristics have contributed substantially to establishing legal and administrative foundations of considerable value to the U.S. Intelligence Community. As such, I request that this commendation be placed in the official files of the individuals involved for a job well done!

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, EA/PENS
SUBJECT: Change of Home Base and Punctional Category
Frederick C. Randall

1.  The Services Staff recently forwarded to your office a personnel action requesting a change of home-base and functional category for Mr. Frederick C. Randall. This memorandum is intended to provide additional information regarding this change as requested by FA Personnel.

2.  Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff in February 1975 to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO. This assignment followed approximately ten years of service with FR Division. Mr. Randall's performance since reporting to this Staff has been outstanding. He is currently responsible for a staff of 12 employees and with the increasing responsibilities as a result of the enactment of the Privacy Act it is anticipated that additional personnel will be required in order to handle the workload.

3.  Mr. Randall has been responsive in the handling of FOI requests and is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, and analytic skills. He has done an excellent job of establishing realistic manpower requirements for the Privacy and Information Coordinator Staff, keeping up with a heavy workload while training new employees and making constant adjustments as further experience is gained in the administration of the FOI and Privacy Acts.

4.  It is my opinion, and also CG's, that Mr. Pandall's strengths are in a staff assignment such as his current one. Therefore, following discussions with Mr. Randall, it was agreed that his home-base and functional category should be changed from DMG to DAC.

5.  If there are any additional questions concerning this change, I will be glad to discuss it further.

Assignment - DO Division

1. The Personnel Management Committee of DO Division reviewed the assignment of Mr. Frederick Randall to DO Division in view of his request for a two year extension of his tour in DO and FE Division's request that DO Division consider changing his Home Base to DO.

2. The Acting Chief, DO Division has approved the committee's recommendation that (a) Mr. Randall remain in DO Division for an additional two years until July 1973, (b) Subject's Home Base not be changed to DO Division since DO does not normally Home Base personnel assigned to us on a rotational assignment, and in view of Mr. Randall's expressed desire for an overseas assignment following his two year extension in DO. Mr. Randall feels that his personal circumstances would permit him to accept an overseas assignment at that time.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

THROUGH: Chairman, DDO QSI and Honor and Merit Awards Panel

SUBJECT: Request for a Quality Step Increase for Mr. Frederick C. Randall, GS-14

1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. Frederick C. Randall.

2. Mr. Randall has been employed by the Agency since September 1951. He has spent his Agency career in the Operations Directorate serving with East Asia and Foreign Resources Divisions. He has had field assignments in Jakarta and Tokyo and spent four years at FR Base, Washington.

3. In early 1975, Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO. In spite of the ambiguity of evolving guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines, a very large volume of work and the cultural trauma the Act and its implementation generated, Mr. Randall's performance has been outstanding. He is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills, and realistic, while tough-minded, protection of DIO sources and methods. In addition to his FOI responsibilities, Mr. Randall was just designated the Privacy Act Coordinator for the DDO. It is still too early to predict the actual work requirements as a result of this Act, but it is anticipated that Mr. Randall will meet these added responsibilities in the same exceptional manner as he has fulfilled his FOI duties.

4. Consideration has been given to the granting of an Honor and Merit Award. However, it is felt that a Quality Step Increase will provide more appropriate recognition of Mr. Randall's outstanding performance during the past seven months in a very challenging and demanding assignment.

## 11. PREFERENCE FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT

### 11A. DESCRIBE BRIEFLY THE TYPE OF WORK YOU WOULD PREFER FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT IF DIFFERENT FROM THAT INDICATED IN ITEM NO. 9 ABOVE. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE PREFERENCE, INDICATE YOUR CHOICE.

After completing three years as a case officer in the Washington Base I feel that a change of assignment would be beneficial both to myself and WOFIRM. In past assignments I have served as a field case officer in several field stations and as a desk chief and staff officer at Headquarters. My personal/professional interests lie in the field of international relations in the Far East (I have taught international politics at the college level and currently am completing a Ph. D. degree as a part-time after-hour student). I would like to be assigned to a position in which I could utilize my past operational experience as well as my substantive interests. My first choice would be a tour with WOHORN, or if a position there is unavailable at this time, a similar position within WOMACE.

### 11B. INDICATE IF YOU DESIRE TO EXTEND YOUR CURRENT TOUR BY CHECKING IN APPROPRIATE BOX. ALSO INDICATE PREFERENCE FOR NEXT REGULAR ASSIGNMENT BY INSERTING 1, 2, 3 (for 1st, 2nd. and 3rd choice) IN REMAINING BOXES. COMPLETE ALL ALTERNATE CHOICES AND OPTIONS IN ALL CASES EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE REQUESTING AN EXTENSION OF YOUR TOUR.

*   EXTEND TOUR

MONTHS AT CURRENT STATION TO

*   BE ASSIGNED TO WOHORN FOR A TOUR OF DUTY; INDICATE YOUR CHOICE OF DIVISION, STAFF OR OFFICE.

2ND CHOICE see above 3RD CHOICE

*   BE ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER FIELD STATION; INDICATE CHOICE OF GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR SPECIALIZATION

IN TURN

1. (S) I wish to commend and make a matter of record the outstanding support rendered to this organization by Mr. Frederick Randall, Area Liaison Coordinating Detachment Tokyo, Japan, from the period of July 1963 to date. Mr. Randall served as the focal point for 6499th Support Group coordination of various collection operations in consonance with national and service directives. He was at all times most tactful and helpful, and all who came in contact with him left with the feeling that they had met a true professional.

2. (S) Mr. Randall contributed greatly to the overall morale and esprit de corps of those persons charged with the responsibility of planning for and initiating new operations to gather data of priority national aerospace interest. He handled potentially embarrassing situations with humor, dignity and aplomb. He gave freely of himself and spent many hours in assisting us in coordinating various operations, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of proposed approaches to collecting information, and in serving as a most effective go-between this headquarters and various station chiefs in other areas when operations under way were multi-national in area. We liked, trusted, and respected him.

3. (S) Mr. Randall's outstanding effectiveness as a co-ordinator of intelligence collections was exemplary in nature and reflected great credit upon him and his parent organization.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT: Notification of Approval of Quality Step Increase -
Frederick Randall

1.  I am pleased to send to you the attached official notification of the approval of the Quality Step Increase which you recommended for this employee.

2.  The salary increase accomplished by the award of a Quality Step Increase is important and tangible evidence of the esteem in which the employee so recognized is held. However, I believe the commendatory and incentive benefits of this award will be partially lost unless it is presented in an appropriate ceremony which will afford the individual recognition among co-workers and supervisory officials. Also, I believe such recognition serves to inspire other employees to aspire to earning such recognition.

3.  May I ask, therefore, that you arrange to have this Quality Step Increase presented at an appropriate ceremony.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

ATTENTION: DDP/OP

SUBJECT: Request for Quality Step Increase - Frederick C. Randall

1.  On the basis of the information presented below, it is recommended that a quality step increase be approved for Frederick C. Randall.

2.  Mr. Randall has been affiliated with this Agency since September 1951, and has been assigned to the Operational Support Staff at Tokyo since 1961. Mr. Randall's duties are: liaison with the military clandestine intelligence community; commanding officer of a principal Agency military cover unit; supervisor of the Central Registry; supervisor of the local TSD establishment; and Agency participation in a multi-agency CI Repository and an Agency-run multi-agency Central Carding facility. Mr. Randall's primary duty at the Tokyo Station is Station PBRAMPART responsibilities, These responsibilities are broad and highly important to all RAMPART relations throughout the Far East. Through Mr. Randall's intensive effort to strengthern and increase the Agency's role in the coordination of clandestina-collection activities, he has been able to set a positive pattern of effective procedures for coordination of the military serviceal clandestine collection operations. These procedures are now being emulated wherever possible throughout the Far East. Mr. Randall's tenacity and. patlence, based on solid operational field and Headquarters experience, have worked to a distinct advantage for the Agency in the RAMPART field. The Chief of Station, Tokyo has stated that the vast improvement in the local coordination business has been in large part due to Mr. Randall's exceptional ability to do a good job. Further, as a supervisor and a manager, he has quite successfully handled from 10 to 15 subordinates in the diversified functions listed above.

3.  During Mr. Randall's total service at the Tokyo Station, he has demonstrated his ability and capability to carry out a variety of taaks in un exemplary manner. Mr. Randall has been in grade as a CS-13 since September 1958. He has been recommended three times for promotion to CS-14 since 1963. Due to the limited number of promotions made in this grade category, he was not selected. The Chief of Station and Chief, Far Rast Division request that Mr. Randall be granted a quality step increase for a long tenure of strong performance and as recognition of an outstanding Job well done in his present assignment.

CONFIDENTIAL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 265

CONFIDENTIAL

4. As stated above, Mr. Randall has continued to perform in an except--
   ionally strong manner and is expected to continue for the remainder of his
   present and future assignments. We have considered the presentation of an
   Honor or Merit Award; but the Division feels that a quality step increase
   appears to be more appropriate in this particular case due to his extended
   period of time in grade without promotion. Mr. Randall is scheduled for
   reassigament in June 1965 and we feel the granting of a quality step
   increase at this time will indicate our appreciation and recognition of
   his excellent performance.

CC CPSU Representative in Buenos Aires

REFS: A. ED-7782, 19 February 1971
B. HABA 22379, 17 September 1971
C. HABA 21382, 18 May 1970

1. Headquarters can provide no additional guidance on CC CP5U Representatives abroad other than that forwarded in Reference A.

2. According to Reference B, the Station has tentatively identified one of the Soviet diplomats in Buenos Aires as the CC CPSU Representative. Since this individual was not named in Reference B, a Headquarters review of the files of Soviets most likely to hold this position has been made and from the information currently available to us, Viktor Grigoryevich CHEKMAZOV (201-128117) appears to be this individual.

3. Although CHEKMAZOV's present andpast duties do not fit all the criteria set forth in Reference A, there are certain indicators that he is the CC UPSU Reprosentative. Little is known of CHEKMAZOV's tour in Cuba, where he was assigned as Second Secretary and Chief of the Consular Section fron 1960 to 1963. Prior to that, however, CHEKMAZOV was a Consular Officer in Uruguay from 1954 to 1958. Among his repertoed daties there, the following could be considered as bacåground leading to his suspected current position:

a) handled emigre and repatriation nattern aad ves lavalved in activities requiring Spanish, which be and his wife speak reasonably sell.

b) believed to be active in the Colony's MESTKOM, (which in general is social rather than political, although the political element is ever-present. The MESTKON Secretary is totally a Pasty activist who is responsible for making cortain that ne possible coviation from the Party line crops up in any URETKON discussions or activities.)

c) reportedly became angry with a colleague who refused to prepare a speech commemorating GORKIY's birthday.

c) wife supervised production of the Soviet publication, URSS.

4. In his current position as Counselor of Embassy, CHEKMAZOV enjoys apparent freedom of movement and is sufficiently high-ranking to be the CC CPSU Representative. In addition, no firm identification has ever been made of his affiliation with either the KGB or the GRU. Although the Station reported in BUENOS AIRES - 18575, 29 June. 1971, that CHEKHAZOV was believed to be a "likely candidate for new KGB Resident", it would seem from information contained in headquarters files that he is more likely the SC CPU Representative. An excerpt from Reference C contains the following indicators:

During visits to the Soviet "Quinta" almost every week-end, CHAKMAZOV

a) lunched with the Ambassador,

b) spent long pariode reading, seated outdoors under the trees and remained generally aloof from other Soviets,

c) vas the culy Soviet who addressed other Soviets as "Comrade", and

d) his wife was said to treat vives of lever-ranking perwennel is a brusk and autheriterion manner.

While the indicators cited above are not conclusive in themselves in establishing that CHIKHAZOV is the CC CPSU Reprosentative, they de point up the possibility that he might be acting in that capacity.

5. We sinil be interested to learn the identity of the Station's tentativo CC CPEU Representative selectica. In addities, fres our review of the files mentioned in Paragraph 8, it seems that the neet likely candiente for KOB Resident in Doones Aires is Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV (201-836701), with of ther Stepenas Pavlovich PABACSIS (201-780353) er Doris Ivanovich Boxin (201-847289) as Deputy Kür Resident. We should also like to have the Station's thinking as to the Identition of the KGB Resident and his Deputy.

Surveillance of AEBOOR,

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

(Alteryer)

1. Since his move to the Residence/Club in mid-1970,
   AEBOOR has appeared to withdraw from almost all overt activity.
   Rarely does he appear on BILOCULAR and his daily routine is a
   complete mystery. In order to determine his present status,
   the BIBAFFLES were directed to run a surveillance on AEBOOR
   from Monday, 6 September through Tuesday, 14 September 1971,
   During this period his wife was away on home leave, thus
   giving him the opportunity to pursue a different life if he
   were so inclined. His overt subordinate in the cultural
   field, 201-820310, had left PCS without a replacement.
   Presumably his cover activities would be multiplied. Despite
   all this, AEBOOR maintained a spartan routine which left no
   clue about his present interests, activities, or responsibilities,

2. Most mornings (including Saturday and Sunday), he
   drove or walked to the Embassy, often buying a paper on the
   way. Once inside he stayed until about 1300 hours when he
   returned to the Residence/Club. His lunch break was rarely
   longer than a half hour. He returned to the Embassy and
   stayed at least until 2000 hours, sometimes until 2300 hours.
   Upon leaving, he walked or drove directly to the Residence/
   Club and never came out again during the night.

3. AKBOOR's only deviations from this schedule were an
   occasional trip to a neighbourhood shop to buy cold-cuts;
   one excursion to a leather-goods store to look at suitcases;

one attendance at a MEKNIGHT Embassy function; two trips to Ezeiza airport; and, surprisingly enough, a Sunday afternoon tour with 201-873887 and his wife to take pictures along the river front and drink beer in a Costanera cafe. (During this last excursion, the known KGB officer drove the GRU chauffeur and his wife.) The first trip to the airport was made in the company of several other high-ranking Embassy officials to greet an important transiting delegation. (See HABA-22399.) On the second trip AEBOOR was accompanied by 201-128117 (suspect KGB resident) and 201-790164 (chauffeur). On arrival, AEBOOR and his companions went up to the terrace to take photos of the Concorde as it landed for a two-day visit. They were joined by Mr. and Mrs. AELESION and 201-228494. Evidently, the KGB and the GRU groups went separately to photograph the same plane.

4. Twice during the period the BIBAFFLES felt that AEBOOR might have been checking for surveillance. Otherwise there were no incidents of note. Not once were the BIBAFFLES approached by local authorities with a request that they identify themselves.

5. In sum, we remain as much in the dark as before about AEBOOR. With every opportunity and reason in the world to lead a hectic pace, he spent the majority of his waking hours within the Embassy. During the days in question he received only one phone call even worth noting, one in connection with the Fischer-Petrosyan chess match scheduled for late September.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

1. Attachment F to Reference was translated and given to BIBAFFLE transcribers for their use some months ago. Transmitted herewith are copies of the resulting assessment questionnaires on six official Soviets and three local Soviet Cultural Representation Employees. A breakdown on the transcribers and their products is as follows:

BIBAFFLE-30: Assessments on Mikhail Konstantinovich VRAGOV (201-820310); Yelena Fedorovna VRAGOVA; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV (201-236701); Roza Aleksejevna ALFERYEVA; and local employees Constantino LOGVINIUK and Luis ORSETTI.

BIBAFFLE-33: Assessment of local employee Esteban SEMENIUK (201-860420).

BIBAFFLE-45: Assessment of VRAGOV and wife; of Sergey Iosifovich SOKOLOVSKIY (201-025485) and wife Aleksandra Vasilyevna; and of Constantin LOGVINIUK.

2. The material in the questionnaires simply reflects the transcribers' impressions and is not necessarily correct. BIBAFFLE-30 sees ALFERYEV as short and VRAGOV as greying; but ALFERYEV is tall and VRAGOV's hair is still completely sandy.

BIBAFFLES-30 and 15 seem to be talking of different people when they describe the VRAGOVS and Constantino 1OGVINIUK. One of BIBAFFLE-45's impressions that we are checking is her statement that the SOKOLOVSKIYs have occasional parties at home with singing and dancing. We have no evidence of such gay get-togethers.

3.  As Headquarters is aware, the BIBAFFLE transcribers only process material from special operations such as AEVARIETY, AELANYARD, etc. and cannot furnish assessment on all individuals in whom we have interest, However, we have requested BIOGENESIS to have the BILOCULAR transcribers work with the form.

3 muy cauta y tambien muy astuta.
A causa de sus celes parece ser despotica, pers es mas pose
siva. Reta muy a menudo a su maride. En asuntos domesticos:
dirige la batuta. Pers en casos en que se tema decisión de
caracter financiere-familiar y sobre todo en casos que con
ciernen al trabajo, es el maride quien manda. No es sumisa,
discute acaleradamente, pero si su marido decide algo, le
bastan 2-3 palabras en el tone tajante para pararla en seco
Entonces le shadece sin chistar siquiera. Rospeta on el fon-
do a su marido, aunque a veces muestra tods le contrarie.

7. SENTIDO DE HUMOR.

Es propensa a hacer bromas, es alegre, especialmente en s
ciedad. Sus bromas no son finas pero en ninguna manera
vulgares. En raras ocasiones manda a su marido a la p, que
le parie, pore es en ocasiones cuando sale a la calle vesti
de, al parecer de ella, inadecuadamente e cuando no cuida de
su salud. En querrellas entre las des (muy frecuentes) ra-
ras veces de escuchan obscenidades. Cuande se enoja llama
su maride "aborten menstruose" • "fascista".

8. HABITOS INTERESE HOBBYES

a) Parece no tener. Ve con regularidad TV. (especialmente las
transmisiones de la hora religiosa, esta ne la deja pasar)

b) Ya se hable de este. Ver Ivan.

c)Tiene inclinación especial hacia el sexo?

No se neta. Es celosa, es todo.

4) Tiene tes. A vecos persistento y largo tiempo.

From HABA-21382, 18 May 1970, Source: BIOGENESIS

ARKENEV IVAN (1°. Secretario - Sección Cultural - K.C.D.) Aparenta ser complaciente con el Embajador y a menudo conversa en el floor a las horas de los cocteles. Habla bastante bien el castellano. Fuma bastante, casi siempre cigarrillos americanos; bebe bastante aunque sin exceso. Es muy susceptible sobre su rango diplomatico. En una oportunidad discutió con el Embajador sobre el significado de la frase "Mizorlov - 1° Secretario-rio, pertenece a la Embajada de la URSS", argumentando que él solo da a entender que buscara bien el significado de las palabras. Es muy ambicioso. Se mantiene siempre muy alejado de su mujer. En una oportunidad le contaron chistes a la mesa al almor-
z; que todos los hicieron bromas por este hecho, lo que significi
ba que eso era popular, las consecuencias del patrimonio Alemán.

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY SHEET

MAY 1970

**A.** TARGET IDENTITY: (Name, DPOB, 201#, present job and location)

Ivan Gavrilovich ALEXEYEV (AEE500R), born 20 January 1928 in Tula, 201-236701
Second Secretary/Cultural Officer at Sovemb, Buenos Aires

**B.** TARGET BACKGROUND: (Brief resume of background, family members and where located, whether known of Suspect RIS, languages.)

Apparently from peasant background. Knows Russian, Speaks Spanish, English.
1958: TDI Argentina (possible. 1960: TDI Havana Wife: Rosa Alekseyevna (20 Sept. 34 in Moscow), sons Vadim (24 Sept. 55 in Moscow). Wife with him, son in BU
1960-1964: Mexico City, PRAVDA rep.
1968-: Buenos Aires, 2nd Sec./Cultural Officer at Sovemb.

**C.** OPERATIONAL SUMMARY: (Short statements on following where applicable: access agents, access informants, residence audio/taps, office audio/taps, physical surveillance, C/O contact, BAB assessment, past recruitment attempts, other. Cite significant documents, starting dates.)

Residence audios ALLANYARD run jointly with DIOGENESIS in August 1968, ALEXEYEV moved ot unexpectedly into compound for unknown reasons in October 1969. (HABA-20979, 4 Nov, 69)

Office security: BILCCULAR is joint liaison teletap.

C/O Direct contacts: Paul W. LEMONE, Nina T. MAGANDE (HABA-20210, 16 January 1969).

**D.** List of Susceptibilities/Vulnerabilities: (List of everything which possibly exploitable by us, and significant steps we have taken to clarify, confirm or refute it. Cite document/source.)

Intense arguments exist between ALEXEYEV and wife (ALLANYARD, BIBAF LE reports, HABA-20523). Their behaviour in Public is all sweetness and light; she appears almost like a different person. She appears to harbor resentment against him because of his behaviour towards her.

ALEXEYEV is very tail-conscious. (HABA-21000, 10 December 1969).

ALEXEYEV has on occasion remained out all night, and has claimed to his wife when he comes home late that he has been working. (HABA-21000, 10 December 1969). Surveillance on him at night allegedly proved he made clandestine contacts.

He was one of the founding members of the Movimiento de Unidad y Coordinación Sindical (MUCs) and reportedly a member of the Communist Party of Argentina. He was also formerly the Secretary General of the Argentine Union of Musiciane. Specific references include:

a. BAB-05124, 16 October 1961, which describes him as the owner of the building in which the ICA Buenos Aires Central Zone Committee had its Headquarters. (This document also identifies NORIEGA as alias Ken HAMILTON.)

b. BSA-12041, 27 October 1961, which reports MORIEGA's travel to Cuba at the invitation of the Confederación de Trabajadores de Cuba.

c. BUENOS AIRES-9189, March 1965, which states MORIEGA attended the Rio Congress for Solidarity for Cuba.

Nevertheless, we assured him he'd be invited the next timo. He was suffering: his usual case of halitosis, which effectively keeps one at a proper distance.

# SPECIAL REPORT

## 1.- SURJECT

Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERIEV was born in Moscow (U.S.S.R.), on the 20th of January 1928, diplomatic passport No. 091.477, married to Rosa Alekseevna ALFERIEVA, born on September 20th, 1934, in Moscow, diplomatic passport No. 019.468. Subject is assigned as 2nd Counsellor of the U.S.S.R. Embassy in Buenos Aires. He arrived in this country on the 27th of January 1968, taking up residence on Uruguay 1176, Sth Floor, apt. "A" in the Federal Capital, Tel. 41-5405, living at said address until de 7th of October 1969 when he moved to live at the Posadas Club (residence for the officers of the soviet representation).

ALFERIEV had been for a short t'we in Argentina during the month of September 1958; in Havana in September 1911; in Quito in January and February 1962 and in Tijuana in September 1963. He was representative of PRAVDA in Mexico during 1960 and 1964.

In view of the fact that subject lived separetely from the rest of the Embassy personnel, his mission based sa information was thus made easier.

It should be pointed out, that during his residence on Uruguay, he was kept under surveillance through a technical penetration carried out by this Section.

As a result of the exploitation of these lines, as well as the Case "ASADO" (summer home) and information trom the "LORO" case, certain details concerning his personality, private life and contacts have been ascertained.

Through thorough study of; above mentioned sources, it is apparent that the ALFERIEVS have certain differences, during which he is the object of vituperation from his wife Rosa, which Ivan thoroughly ignores to the great exasperation of his wife.

## 11.- PERSONALITY OF IVAN ALFERIEV

He is an introvert, clever, cautious and distrustful. He knows how to hide his feelinge and he has an excellent self-control, showing violent feelings on very rare occasions, (ses Section IV).

With relation to his cultural level, nothing much is known, as he has never been heard speaking on themes of general culture, When he speaks at social gatherings he is joking, using double meaning phrases (usually funny)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 79

or he tells jokes. It is as though he were afraid to show that he takes
things seriously, as though he were ashamed or frightened.

During the various opportunities when his wife is screaming ail
sort of impropieties at him he maintains absolute silence, seeming to be
concentrating on one fixed idea, and letting all that Rosa says just slide
off him.

He has been identified and known to belong to the K.G.B. (Soviet
Secret Police). According to a confidential source, he is considered a high
official in the embassy and of aboslute trustworthiness by Ambassador louro
VOLSKI; being respected and feared by the rest of the embassy staff. Не
speaks perfect spanish.

He is present at all receptions with louri VOLSKI and Ivan DIAKOV
(ambassador and Chief of the Commercial Representation, respectively), not
only in his official position, but also in his private life, having a warm
friendship between the three which is quite rare in the embassy circle. During
his stay at the summer home, ALFERIEV and his wife occupy the quarters reserved
for the ambassador.

### PERSONALITY OF ROSA ALIERIEVA

A certain duality of personality is apparent in her behavior. In
her married life she shows herself to be intolerant andimpetuous, arriving
at absolutellack of control on various occasions, bringing forth continual
marital quarrels.

On the contrary, in her social life, she showa herself as a very
decile, cheerful woman, being the center of attraction in almost all the
gatherings for her "lovely disposition" and gayety, not only among the men
but also their wives. (See section I).

Rosa Alekseevne ALFERIEVA is a woman brought up in the typical
soviet atmosphere, subjected sice childhood to a rigid political indoctrination
Su some juvenile organisation and in school. She is not sufficiently intelligent
to rid herself, even partially, of what she has been taught. She does not sepa-
rate her affective life from the obligations that she, presumes, every 88munist
ofeisens should have, it seems that she does not realise the importance of
her husbands mission. She is not a woman who is attuned to her companion.
She is not on the same wave length, she does not understand him. She harbere
a concentrated and continuous resentiment against him. Maybe this is due to.
his tronic, and keen and wounding sense of humour.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 80

With regard to her surroundings, this woman has shown, on various opportunities, to feel antipathy and scorn for Argentina and its people, dueugh probably to its leanings toward democracy, and therefore, contrary to her way of thinking. As she has shown not to possess much imagination, she takes as wonderful that which she has been taught. However, the reason for her poor matrimonial relations remains a mystery. Maybe one of the reason, as stated above is her lack of understanding of her husband, so that one quarrel on top of the other has built a wall which cannot be breached.

In the company of her friends, Rosa has always shown herself to be pleasant, gay and uncomplicated. She has not always masked her marital problems, so that they are not a secret to the rest of the members of the embassy, who nevertheless make believe they know nothig about it, through consideration or whatever other motives they may have. On some occasions VOLSKI has taken the initiative to improve relations berween the ALFERIEVS, to no avail.

## IV.- MODUS OPERANDI WHICH HAS SHOWN UP FROM SURVEILLANCE

During the shadowing of Ivan ALFERIEV, he has shown himself to be an expert in this matter. He is observant and his movements in the street are carried out carefully and abity- on many opportunities he has shaken off his shadows. He is an excellent driver, and he uses all sorts of ruses to trow off the agents on the jed. This is proved below:

Shadowing on 23-5-691

He drove his car down Cordoba Av., turned on 9 July going towards Cerrito, which was closed off for repairs. In the middle of the street were two signs which read: "DETOUR, VISK CENTER LANES". Subject disregarded the signs and continued straight ahead towards Viamonte, where transit was completely out off, and he had to take July again and comes to the Obelisco.

With this trick, ALFERIEV wanted to learn whether he was being followed.

SHADOWING on 20-5-691

He went into the Bank of Napoli, approaches the counter, carries on a conversation with an employee, and vantahes without being observed inspite of close vigilance .

- Before going into a building of store, he locke in buth directions and searches carefully.
- When he goes in his car, he drives slowly, but every so often, he steps on the gas, and then abruptly reduces speed, doing this various times.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 81

- 4 -

--During all the shadowings carried out, subject always managed to go ahead on the yellow light, leaving his shados generally facing the red light.

- On various occasions he went up one way streets,

## V.- CONTACTS

It was ascertained that ALFERIEV arrived home very late at night and even at dawn, which is quite out of the ordinary with the rest of the diplomatic personnel. (See Annex 2).

This led to the supposition that subject was either leading a licentious life or carrying out clandestine activities. Therefore, a permanent suverveillance was carried out during 24 hours for 20 days on his home, proving that he dead in reality come home between 6 and 7 at times.

Fifteen days before his return to the U.S.S.R. for his leave, a surveillance and shadowing service was set up during all 24 hours, proving that subject did make clandestine contacts.

It was under these circumstances that on the 21/5/69, at 1200 hours, a contact was spotted. This occurred once again on the 23/5/69, at which time the "contact" was suspicious of being followed end he pulled quickly out of the area.

On the 18th of August of the present year, when a security agent who was carrying out his duties on the ALFERIEV address (improvement of the P.T.), spotted the above mentioned contact patrolling the sone; with the aid of a Policeman he was detained in order to be identified, his documents are the following:

Names. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Alberte Do KYO

O.I.No. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,432,687 Pol. Fod.

Profession. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Nevepaperman

After investigation was carried out it was established that subjec did not live at said address and that his I.D, was not his.

Continuing the investigation it was learned that at Moldes 1872, 7th floor, a certain Alberto DC EYO did live there, and that he worked at Editorial "ESTAMPA", address Calle Salta 980, Federal Capital, Tel. 23-4052/8958/6166 and also in the firm "PETERSEN THIELE CRUZ and CIA", Rivarola 175, Federal Capital, Tel, 45-8811, 46-1334/1666 and 40-1785, which wat in the construction and sale of apartments.

When Editorial "ESTAMPA" was visited, it was learned that this firm had gone out of business for some time.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 82

Following investigation, it-was-learned at the administrative offices of the tirm "PETERSEN THILLE CRUZ y Cia", Talcahuano 178, 1st Floor, Federal Capital, the agent in charge of the investigation was waited by subject, who turned out to be:

Names .......................... Alberto DO EYO

Antecedents:

It should be pointed out that in order to establish his activities and connections with ALFERIEV, starting 22-10-69 a surveillance and shadowing vas carried out on subject.

On the other hand, and as a result of the use of the clandestined microphones, it was learned that Ivan ALFERIEV, maintained conversations with a person by the name of MOGUILEVSKY, who was a member of the directive Council of the Metropolitan Federation of Chess and the Argentine Federation.

Investigation carried out on subject determined the following:

Names .......................... Marcelino MOGUILEVSKY

address on Viamonte 1360, 6th Floor, Federal Capital.

Beginning October 22nd of this year a surveillance and shadowing service was established to determine his activities and possible contacts with ALFERIEV.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

With reference to the 2nd Councellor of the U.S.8.R., Ivan ALFERIEV, the following conclusions have been reached!

a) He is a diplomatic officer who carries out his professional work efficiently, showing at all times great sagacity when carrying out public contacts and relations, avoiding on various opportunities with ingenuity and ability the shadowing detail assigned to him.

b) With reference to his relations and activities within theinbassy, it is observed that he carries a lot of weight over the rest of the personnel, as he is given deferential attention and respect not only at official but private functions within the circle.

c) He is a person who is always busy, on the go all day and on into the late hours of the night.

4) His married life is not harmonious, due to the character of his wife who is temperamental and impetuous and not tolerant toward subject. It is estimated that these misunderstandings are linked to his activities outsidde of normal working hours, which take him away from home, as well as, the indifference and silence with which her recriminations are received.

e) with reference to his contacts, mentioned in this report, the corresponding investigations are being carried out to determine how t'er they reach and their importance.

1.  We have kept you up to date on AELOOR's sudden move and the subsequent termination of AELANYARD. At the present time, we still do not know whether or not the story of a sudden transfer to Mexico City was in reality the basis for the move or if a compromise of the operation was the actual cause. As wo pointed out in our criginal cable, our immediate thought was that perhaps the AVDOLMAN flap had caused all AEKICK types to "pull in" and that perhaps AEBOOR was simply following orders. Subsequent investigation, however, tended to discredit this thought.

2.  The AELANYARD transcripts reveal that AEBOOR did indeed contemplate the move several days before we actually had wind of it. His wife did not like the idee and complained to him about the move. AEBOOR also told his landlord in advance of his move. There is also evidence that AEBOOR was in somewhat regular contact with the Mexican Embassy and although we were not certain, it appeared that he was anxious to learn if his visa had been granted. In any case, on 28 September 1969, AEBOOR and wife checked out of their apartment.

3.  Shortly thereafter, we made a physical check of the interior of the apartment. Everything seemed to bo in order. There was no evidence whatsoever that the technical end of the operation had been tampered with. As we said before, it functioned up until and after AEBOOR vacated.

4.  We have not been able as yet to establish direct social contact with AEBOOR. Both Nina T. MARGANDE and Paul W. LEVERONE (who have legitimate reason to seek him out) have tried, but to date, to no avail. Our hope has been to have AEBOOR actually tell us of his plans - will he indeed be transferred to Mexico? Our original thought was that the Mexico Station could readily determine if he had indeed applied for a visa to that country. As you know, we struck out here also.

5. The fact is that as of this writing, we do not know whether AEBOOR's move was routine and innocent or if indeed there was sowothing sinister involved. If AEBOOR does indend pick up and move to Mexico, we shall, of course, be somewhat relieved. However, this will not answer categorically the major question - was the operation compromised? It would appear that regardless of what happens to AEBOOR, we shall never know the actual reason for nis move. However, for what it is worth, the evidence here does not point toward a compromise.

Transmitted herewith for SB Division are copies of the passports of Soviet couriers Viktor Sergeyevich MININ and Petr Leontyevich SAMOYLOV (Diplomatic 12303 and 12133 respectively.) These documents were obtained by BIOGENESIS Travel Controls. MURIN and SAMOYLOV first transited Buenos Aires on 8 Septerber on reference Alitalia flight from Montevideo to Santiago. They did not deplane but delivered four packages to local Soviet Embassy officials who boarded. (BIOGENESIS did not identify the officials.) They retransited Argentina on 15 September via KLM 792 from Santiago to Montevideo and again remained on the plane. Yuriy Yuryevich BORKHED (201-824296) and Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV (201-236701) boarded to deliver four packages. (This is perhaps the first time that ALFERYEV, known KGB, has met a courier flight. The explanation for his having done so may rest in the fact that Consul Antanas Ionovich YURAMENAS (201-779979), the suspect KGB officer who usually has this job, suffered a serious heart attack on 19 July and has been confined to his apartment since.)

B. LABW-11445, dated 21 April 1969

1. Forwarded under separate cover are two AZLANYARD
   tapes covering 26, 27 and 28 July 1969. The recording for
   the 28th runs through the last half of the first tape and
   all of the second; it involves a conversation between
   AEBCOK and 201-268170 regarding the former's experiences
   during his recent home leave. We should very much
   appreciate having Headquarters' monitors review this
   conversation of 28 July and forward to Buenos Aires as
   complete a transcription as possible. Once the transcription
   is finished the tapes may be destroyed.

2. In reference B Headquarters suggested that samplings
   of AZLANYARD be forwarded tri-annually. Since we have begun
   forwarding the most interesting AZLANYARD tapes for transcrip-
   tion at Headquarters, we assume there is no longer any need
   to transmit routine samplings of the initial BIOGENESIS
   product.

SUBJECT: REDTOP/AEKICK/AEBOOR Operational Possibilities Against FJSTEAL Priority Targets

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES:
Action Required: See Paragraph 5.
Reference: HABW-11473, dated 5 June 1969

1. The detailed analysis of the Station's operational efforts against some of the priority FJSTEAL targets and the suggestion that perhaps AEBOOR offered the best immediate operational promise and warranted special attention was reviewed and discussed by the interested officers; it should come as no surprise to Headquarters that there is really little divergence of opinion, not only as to the priority target, but also insofar as operational approach and conduct is concerned. We would like to correct the apparent Headquarters impression that the Station was negligent in the follow-up of operational opportunities and was waiting for the FJSTEALEès to take the initiative insofar as future contacts were concerned. We believe Station efforts have been as aggressive as possible in the existing operational climate, and if we were remiss, it was in failing to report in detail the various negative results of what we consider normal operational efforts.

2. AEBOOR was selected as one of the priority Station targets for the simple reason that three officers had direct access to him through Identity; once he accepted the invitation to Paul W. LEVERONI's home he was moved up to the top of the priority list since it was hoped that continued and rather frequent contest could be maintained for assessment and operational purposes. Every reasonable effort was made to follow

up the first social contact (experience has shown that the FJSTEALers here will not take the initiative and must be actively pursued) but a number of conversations (both face to face and by phone) ended up in the vague promise on the part of Subject that "we must get together soon". In the interim the Station tightened the coverage of AEBOOR by putting AELANTARD on a 24-hour-a-day basis for a little over two weeks and by conducting full coverage surveillance for about one week. Our reasoning behind this acting was as follows: such intensive coverage would possibly permit us to spot a likely place where we could inject an access agent; it would give us a better "feel" of his daily activity; it might uncover one or more of his clandestine contacts. The results of the effort, while far from solving our problems, did give us a wealth of information which should help us in our operational planning-once AEBOOR returns to his station.

3.  The distaff side of the target was not ignored, and Nina T. MARGANDE managed to spend some time in conversation with AF300R's wife during a get-together of Identity on 21 May 1969. As a resuls of this meeting the groundwork has been laid for a follow-up by MARGANDE; despite the fact that the wife was at first cool and then lukewarm to the idea of getting together for a shopping excursion, we will do everything sible to bring such a meeting about and try have MARGANDE become the wife's "confidante', if this is possible. (In order to permit MARGANDE to pursue this contact in the most natural manner and to give her a chance to meet and assess other FJSTEALer wives, she has also become a member of Identity.)

4.  Until his leparture for home leave AEBOOR was the primary FJSTEAL target and will continue in this position after his return until we can reach a decision regarding future action. There is one thing that should be kept in mind, however; and that is the fact that all of the FJSTEALers are reserved in their dealings with members of LNPURE. It seems that it is possible to get some of the FJSTEALers to accept an invitation, even to a private home, but to try to develop such a contact into a continuing social relationship is a much harder proposition. Leland 0. KROULD's experience with 201-313506 followed this pattern, and despite KROULD's efforts to continue ard follow up what seemed to be the beginning of a good relationship, nothing came of the attempt, Stephen M. CARSIDE twice tried to utilize a natural opportunity to get together with 201-820310, only to be put off, as he was in an approach to 201-625485; Paul W. LEVERONE tried on several occasions to arrange a dinner with 201-183943, only to be put off (and this despite the fact that 201-183943 maintains extensive social contacts with non-WOLADY types). 801-025485 has expressed an interest in social contact, and since he is a senior type who should not have to check out and obtain approval for his social activity, we hope that he will not conform as closely to the pattern. This is not the time or place to examine the possible reasons for the FJSTFALer attitude; it is merely mentioned to demonstrate that we are fighting an uphill (although not a hopeless) battle, a battle that we intend to win by fair means or foul.

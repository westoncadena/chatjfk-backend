FRANK - Frank was the hardest working student of the group. He consistently arded himself to all phases of the aining with equal and great diligence. However, his practical work, which took him a great deal of time to perform, was always a little sloppy. When Frank crimped detonators or threw improvised grenades, he was very shaky. However, he did not seem at all nervous about working with other hazardous material. He asked many pertinent questions which contributed to the group's training and always answered test questions correctly and in detail. He was cooperative and reacted well to correction. Some supervision was required since the staff instructors were concerned about his nervousness with detonators. His overall performance was rated as proficient.

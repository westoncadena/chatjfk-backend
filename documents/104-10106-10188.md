# 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SUBJECT: Sam Jaffe

DO NOT REPRODUCE
RETURN TO CIA

1.  Sam Jaffe's relationship with the Agency predates his assignment to Moscow as an ABC correspondent. During the period 1958-60 while in New York Jaffe was a confidential informant of the FBI on his Soviet contacts in New York. In addition, he had several meetings with the New York office of CIA's Domestic Contact Division. While in Moscow with ABC Jaffe felt he was the subject of a recruitment attempt by the KGB in 1962. He recounted his story to the Regional Security Officer at the American Embassy in Moscow, copies of which went to both CIA and FBI. Jaffe covered the Gary Powers' trial for ABC and flew on the same plane from New York to Moscow with the Barbara Powers' party. Prior to that trip he was briefed by a CIA psychologist on ways to observe Powers's behavior and demeanor. Jaffe was never "ordered" to cover the Powers' trial, but simply acted as an enterprising newspaperman befriending Barbara Powers while her party was enroute and in the Soviet Union.

2.  During the latter part of his time in Moscow Jaffe was in contact with a KGB officer, Kuvkov, and this relationship is a matter of record with the FBI. There is some evidence that Jaffe was given preferential treatment by the Soviet authorities. Some western pressmen felt that Jaffe, as an aggressive newspaperman, was giving a little to get a story. Jaffe has given his version of his dealings with the KGB in a lengthy 1969 interview with the FBI.

3.  The defector Nosenko provided information on Jaffe's relationship to the KGB in 1964. However as time went on, further debriefings of Nosenko indicated that Nosenko was not as sure about Jaffe's relationship as he had been originally. By 1968 Nosenko was positive only that Kuvkov had been in touch with Jaffe, but Nosenko was not certain that Jaffe was a paid and witting agent of the KGB.

4.  During Jaffe's tour in Hong Kong, and subsequently in Washington, he was in touch with CIA officers. He provided good information on a Chinese news official and he was helpful to the Agency in reporting on a Canadian organization, The Committee of New China Policy All official contact with Jaffe ended in 1971.

5.  Central to Jaffe's charges about CIA, which he has made public many times, is Jaffe's belief that the CIA passed derogatory information about him to his employers. Attached is a 24 November 1975 letter from Mr. Colby to Jaffe which states categorically that no information in the CIA files had ever been passed outside of official channels. In addition to this letter Jaffe has been reassured on this point verbally on at least four other occasions.. The CIA is positive that Jaffe's recall from Hong Kong in 1968

and subsequent dismissal by ABC, are not related to any action taken by the CIA..

6. In discussions with Jaffe he frequently recounts a conversation he had with Mr. Ted Cowen, a British intelligence official in Hong Kong. 06/08
   According to Jaffe, Cowen told him that he had a "security problem" but o this problem would clear up in due course. A close check of our files can not ellucidate what Cowen was talking about. It is possible, of course, 06 that Cowen was alluding to the Nosenko allegations as the British were 06 ) given much of the Nosenko debriefings. The record is unclear on this point. However, based on information available to this Agency, we feel we have tried to pacify Jaffe with the statement contained in the Colby letter that we have no evidence he has ever been an agent of any foreign intelligence service.

7. Jaffe has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to CIA which has resulted in the release of a large number of documents to him. Jaffe can, of course, appeal our withholding of certain documents through appropriate administrative and judicial procedures under the FOIA.

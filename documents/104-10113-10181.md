A review of the subjects' files reflects that they do not meet with the requirements set forth in recent instructions from the Assistant Director for Special Operations.

It request that this office be furnished with two copies of current Personal History Statements of each of the subjects at the earliest date possible in order that appropriate security checks may be initiated.

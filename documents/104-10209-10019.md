# DISPATCH

TO: Chief of Station, Austria C/ Paris, Austria

FROM: Chief of Base, Salzburg

SUBJECT: REDWOOD/LCMTOTE/AE/CM-1

ACTION REQUIRED: Vienna, please make appropriate number of prints from attached negative.

REFERENCES:

a.  EE-10664, 23 May 1961
b.  LATA-20253, 19 July 1961 (not to Germany or Paris)
c.  PACA-1185, 7 August 1961
d.  PAVA-23594, 4 October 1961

1.  References b., c. and d. contain Forma's instructions to Salzburg regarding identifying Subject; our initial reply stating: there was no information in UCF files; and Vienna's permission to run unilateral police traces through GRETIGI-1, respectively.

2.  GRETIGI-1's initial report (received on 31 October 1961) states that

Semen POHORILIJ - born 2 February 1910 in Cherkassy/Kiev, married, teacher, Ukrainian citizen, resided at the refugee camp in Siezenheim, Salzburg, from 13 July 1950 to 23 August 1950. Prior to 15 July 1950 he lived at the Hellbrunn refugee camp in Salzburg. According to police records Subject left Salzburg for the United States on 23 August 1950.

3.  Additional information in the form of a photographic copy of the official police registration card and a negative of an identification photograph of Subject, both dated 7 November 1947 reveals that:

Semen POHORILIJ - born 2 February 1910 in Przemysl, is a Polish citizen, married, teacher, 176 cm tall, grey eyes, blond hair, oval face, no prominent or identifying features.

The date on the registration card presumably indicates the date on which Subject was first officially registered by the Salzburg police.

4.  We are returning to Vienna the photograph sent us under reference b. for their retention. We have also attached the identification negative noted in the preceding paragraph. Would Vienna please make prints for SR and Paris and attach them to their copies of this dispatch.

Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich

FROM: Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBJECT: Semen Spiridon POHORILYJ also known as Semen POHORILIW
Internal Security - R

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence from this office regarding the subject and to your file number 105-93295.

2. An official French liaison source reported in early September 1961 that Antin HYCZPCRUE received a letter with the return address: (fru) DIALNAWSKY, 63/N. 7 SA. (sic) Philadelphia 23, Pa. The address was also received from an official U.S. source as 13/H 7 SA. but this is believed to be a typographical error. It has not been possible to verify the address as the envelope was not photographed but was passed routinely from the post office to HYCZFORUK. The letter was not tested for secret writing.

3. The files of this Agency contain no identifiable information on DIALNAWSKY. It is possible the address should be 631 North Seventh Street, Philadelphia, which is the one used by POHORILIW. According to information from your Bureau, this is the home of Dymto WASILASZUK, Secretary of the Ukrainian Workingmen Association and the residence may be used for meetings of that organization.

4. We would appreciate any information in your files on DIALNAWSKY..

He passed on your request concerning Subject to the local chief of OSFP. He checked his files and found no traces. He suggested that the old IRO files might have something. Checks of these files are normally done by a local investigator of USB. We request permission to bury Subject's name in a short list of names which the local investigator would than be asked to check in the old IRO files. Also, please indicate whether we should try to check this out through GRUMPIC(-1, who presumably would check with the Salzburg police.

The principal object of this exercise is to determine whether the person shown in the attached photograph is identical with Subject. As a minimum please ascertain the addresses at which Subject lived in Salzburg from 1945 to 1950. Depending on what you find, we can then devise some unilateral method of confirming the identity of the attached photo.

SUBJECT: Goran POBORILIN

1. Representatives of the FBI Laboratory have been previously briefed on the KEMPORE TEST which we believed had been used when working on the POBORILIN letter and which established the presence of Se on the letter.

2. We have now been advised by a field representative that a modified version of this process was actually used and it is possible that the Se is detectable by this version of the test, but not by the regular test of which your Bureau has the details.

3. It should be noted that our work on known systems revealed two cases exhibiting the same type of fleeting detection as was noted on the POBORILIN letter. This, of course, does not mean that the POBORILIN letter is written in one of these systems, but merely that fleeting detections can occasionally be expected with this variation of the KEMPORE TEST.

4. Agency headquarters laboratory has not completed a comparison of the original and modified KEMPORE procedures so as to confirm the finding of our field laboratory that the modified test is more sensitive. It is being provided to your Bureau at this time, however, since it is a technique which has been used successfully in a current case.

1.  Attached is a photograph of Saen POHORILIW, which we would like shown, without name, to appropriate unilateral sources for possible identification.

2.  FYI: POHORILIW's name appears as the sender of a letter containing secret writing to Altin SLZYPORUK in Paris, France. The letter was sent in care of Daytro (STP, souther Ukrainian resident of Faris. GYP, in November 1950, asked ANDOGA/1 to deliver the letter to NYCZYPORUK who was confined to a mental saniteriim near Feris. GYP told/I that he (CAYF) and HTCZYPORUK had been involved with Vasiliy YAKUSHENKO (Soviet assigned to UNESCO and the case officer of the arrested emigre Grigariy REBET), and therefore EYP feared coming to the attention of the Frensa police by delivering the letters to NYCZYZCAK. HAYOPAZ analysis revealed the presence of the s/w in the letter from POHORILIW, but failed in attempts to develop the s/w. CORVY and Faric Station are now investigating this cases therefore, in your reply please send an information copy to Paris.

3.  The following is diographic information on Senen POHORILIW.

FROM:
Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBJECT: Semen PCHORILIW
Internal Security - R

1.  Reference is made to your memorandum of 28 February 1961 on Subject.

2.  We plan to discuss with French liaison the receipt by Daytro GNYP and Antin NYCZYPORUK of the letter containing secret writing from Subject, who will be identified to the French only as a resident of the United States. We believe such a discussion is desirable in view of its pertinence to the current investigation of the intelligence activities of Vasiliy MYAKUSHKO (member of the Soviet delegation to UNESCO from April 1957 to August 1960). If such a discussion would adversely affect your interest in POHORILIW, please advise us as soon as possible.

TO:
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich

FROM: Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBJECT: Semen POHORILIW 201-289249
Internal Security - R

1. Reference is made to the following correspondence:

a. Bureau report of 14 February 1961, made at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Subject as above;

b. Memorandum from Deputy Director (Plans), Subject as above, dated 9 January 1961, and numbered CSCI - 3/763,211;

c. CIA Teletype, Subject as above, dated 16 November 1960;

d. CIA Teletype, Subject as above, dated 17 February 1961.

2. We would appreciate being informed whether or not you have had an opportunity to compare the hand writing of Semen POHORILIW and that of the letter bearing his name and address, which we sent to you with reference 1.b..

3. In a review of our files we note that the lack of elabor- ation in our earlier correspondence might cause your Bureau some difficulty. Our statement in reference 1.c. that the POHORILIW letter bore indications of secret writing was based on the findings of our technical staff. One of our technicians applied a test that permitted him to see writing which, although it was not legible, could be seen to be other than that of the overt text. This writing remained visible long enough for another technician

CS COPY 201-289249


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

to confirm its presence. There have been reports that our source
is considered by the Soviets to be American controlled. Thus it
was considered that, if this letter were a Soviet intelligence
communication, it was likely the Soviets would consider the oper-
ation compromised when our source's possession of the letter was
reported. For this reason, we decided it was best to forge a copy
of the PORCRILIW letter and make every attempt to develop any
secret writing it contained. Unfortunately, we were unable to
do so, and the original letter was destroyed in the process. As
we reported in reference l.d. on 8 or 9 January 1961 our source
delivered to Antin NYCZYPORUK the forged copy of the POHORILIW
Letter. To date there has been no report of any reaction to
HYCZYPORUK's receipt of the forgery.

Dmitrio "GNYP, born 13 October 1898 at WASNICZU, Hungary - child of Wassile and JAZWINSKA Paraska, Ukrainian refugee, has lived for about the past twenty years at 211 rue de Bercy, Paris 12eme.

He has been employed, since 1945, as night watchman for the "Societe de Transporte de Vehicules Automobiles", 60 rue St. Ferdinand, Paris 17eme.

His monthly salary is about 60,000 old francs.

From his first carriage, he had two sons, Baseli (36 years old) who lives in Pdand and Lvitomir (34 years old) who lives in the USA.

From his second marriage with Martha MASLY, born 9 September 1903 in LHOW Poland, he had a third son Jean, born 22 May 1940 in Paris (12th arrondiesment) who chose a French nationality.

During the German occupation, GNYP who has been in France since 1925 went to work in Germany as a volunteer for the organization TODT. Returning to Prance in 1943 he worked until the Liberation as a chauffeur for the "Legion SPEER " at Enghien Les Pains.

In 1944, with the liberation, he was arrested and interned at Fresnes for collaboration, but this detention was not followed by condemnation.

In the milieux of Ukrainian refugees he is considered as an opportunist.

Antin *YKYPORUK, born the first of January 1912 in Karkow (Ukraine),
bachelor, has most recently lived at 86 rue de Montreuil-arrived in France in
1950.

He first of all was a manual laborer, and then an electrician.

Bothered with mental troubles, he has been interned since 1954 in
various psychiatric hospitals.

His last stay was in 1959 at Viilejuif.

Since his departure, his activity and sources of income have not been
known because his unemployment payment has been refused by the "Bureau de la
Main d'Oeuvre".

His ordinary resident's card has lapsed since 15 August 1960 and he
is actually violating the law for Foreigners.

It is a question of a violent individual when he has his mental crises.

On several occasions the police have intervened to control him before
interament.

1. Reference is made to your memorandum of 22 November 1960 on this matter.
   Subject.

2. There have been no new developments in France on this matter.
   Our source has been given a facsimile of the PCHORILIW letter, but
   there has been no report on its delivery to Antin EXCZPORUK (see attach-
   ment).

3. We have received the following biographic information:

a. Dmytro GHYP was born on 13 October 1898 at Hasycsyna,
Rohatyn, Western Ukraine. He is married and the father of two
sons, one of whom repatriated to the Ukraine in 1948 and the
other of whom lives in France and is a member of the Ukrainian
nationalist organization - Spilka Ukrainskoji Molodi (The Union
of Ukrainian Youth in France). GHYP's education consists of
four years of elementary schooling in the Ukraine. In 1918 he
served as a non-commissioned officer in the Ukrainian Army in
a formation called the Sitechovi Strilci. GHYP emigrated to
France in 1925. He has been a member of two Ukrainian communist
organizations in France; in 1927 he joined the Soyuz Ukrainskych
Hromadian u Francji (Union of Ukrainian Citizens in France), and
from 1945 to 1947 he was a member of the Batkiwschyna (Homeland).
His address for the past two years has been 211 Rus de Bercy,
Paris XIeme.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 47

b. Antia NYCZYPORUK (according to GHYP his true name is NYKYPORETZ) was born about 1910. He is married and had a wife and two children in Noginsk. Prior to 1944 he was a professor of Ukrainian and West European Literature at a pedagogical institute in Kiev. NYCZYPORUK left the USSR in 1944; from 1945 to 1948 he was in an International Refugee Organization camp in Salzburg, Austria; he has resided in France since 1948.

4. The following details on GRYP's and NYCZYPORUK's involvement with Soviet intelligence were obtained by our source from GHYP and other Ukrainian enigres in France. During the period 1958 to 1960 GRYP and Vasiliy MYAKUSHO, Third Secretary of the Soviet Delegation to UNESCO, frequently visited with each other at the Soviet Embassy and at GHYP's apartment on 211 Rue de Bercy. At the end of 1959 GMTP introduced NYCZYPORUK to MYAKUSHKO. MYAKUSHKO asked NYCZYPOEUK to contribute literary articles to Soviet publications; it is not known whether FYCZYPORUK wrote any such articles. Early in 1960 #YCZYPCHUK developed a persecution complex and was confined to a sanitariun for a short period. GHIP, feering that NYCZYPORUK right expose the GAYP-NYAKUSIKO relationship, provided FYCZYPORUK with free board end lodging in his apartment and with spending money. MYAKUSHKO dropped NYCZYPORUK as soon as the latter's mental condition became obvious. In May 1960 the Soviet Embassy advised HYCZYPORUK to repatriate to the USER as soon as possible, and offered to help locate his family in the USSR. (As you already know, in October 1960 the Soviets sent HYCZYPORUK a letter reporting his family was not in Noginsk. See attachment.)

5. There is a rumor in the Ukrainian exigre colony in Paris that FYCZYPORUK has been a Soviet agent since about 1949. This is based on his close relationship with Josef (aka Osyp) KOZAK since 1949. KOZAK moved to France from Munich in 1946. Until his expulsion in 1950 be vas quite active in the Organization of Ukrainian Nationals/Bandera (OUR/B) in France. He was ousted from the CUR/B because of his excessive curicaity about CUN/B members and their relatives in the U33R. Subsequently it was learned that KOZAK vas in contact with the Soviet Embassy in France. KOZAK is presently residing at 26 rue Gaston Jaillon, Vesines Chalette, Loiret.

Jozef (aka Sayo) KOVAK

ACTION REQUIRED:
For Information

REFERENCES:

1.  KOVAK, a friend of Antin SHUKHEVYCH (see O/A-55524, 25 November 1960), is a West Ukranian of about 50 years of age. He arrived in Paris just after WWII and was engaged as the A CA/ATIA/S operative in France, since he had been involved in this activity in Ukrania until 1946. As an intelligent man, pression graduate, and student of political economy at the University of Nancy, KOVAK was able to learn all A/ATIA secrets.

2.  KOVAK came into contact with Autin HRIHORUK in 1949 and they became fast friends. Ivan HRYOHUK is convinced that KOVAK was already then a Soviet agent and made contact with KOVAK on KGB instructions. Then HRYOHUK and others noticed that KOVAK frequently made critical remarks about A/ATIA activity, displayed excessive curiosity about various A/ATIA members and their relations in the OUN. They became suspicious of him. He was removed from his job and strictly isolated from A/ATIA activity in 1950. Then the SRG dections were reinforced out when it was learned that KOVAK had contact with the Soviet Embassy. He has subsequently maintained his contact with HRYOHUK.

3.  KOZAK is now living at 26 rue Gaston Jaillon, Vesines Chalette, Loiret, where there is a rather large Ukranian colony.

Attachment to GTA-15927
dated 22 November 1960

SUBJECT: Report on Testing of Letters for SW

REFS: (1) OFPA-55220, 4 November 1960
(2) GTA-15921, 8 November 1960
(3) FRAN 7323

1.  The purpose of this report is summarize the laboratory work done on two letters transmitted to us originally as attachments to Reference #1. For identification purposes in this report we shall refer to the letter postmarked in Philadelphia as Letter #1 and the one postmarked in the USSR as Letter #2.

2.  In order to facilitate a better understanding of the results some interpretative data on the tests performed is included.

3.  Because of the requirement that the letters be left in good condition to permit their delivery to the addressee, the initial examination consisted of the customary visual and U.V. inspection (including long wave and short wave), and the so-called KEYNOTE test. This latter test has only recently been introduced and constitutes the most formidable test known to us against SW. It was by means of this test that the presence of SW in letter #1 became apparent. In the application of this test a portion of the SW is actually physically lifted from the item being tested and subsequently through a process involving both chemical and physical reactions, the SW is made visible. The degree of visibility varies from completely negative results to completely legible ones. According to the technician who performed this test the results obtained with Letter #1 were not quite legible, but definite enough to permit checking to establish that they were not due to the visible ink of the letter. The time interval during which this particular detection is observable lasts but a few minutes which the technician used to verify that he was detecting SW and not visible text. By the time he called in his two colleagues the reaction had progressed to the point that only one of these technicians was able to observe the SW. Thus the operator and one other technician saw the SW.

4.  At this point the letters were returned to Paris with Reference #2 which reported "definite traces of SW" in Letter #1.

5.  Before giving an account of the work done during the second phase of the investigation. (i.e., after the letters were returned to the laboratory for development) it should be pointed out that the KEYNOTE test, though an extremely effective test for the detection of SW, does not identify the system involved. Complete development of the secret message under these circumstances would have been almost impossible. The only alternative available to the chemist, and the one he followed in this particular case, is to proceed with a series of chemical tests applied directly to the document under investigation. These tests are applied in sequence, one after the other, each requiring for its execution that a portion of the page be sacrificed. It is therefore important that those tests affording the greatest probability of developing the SW be applied first; thus if and when, a test is found capable of developing the ink, the remainder of the page (i.e., the portion not affected by previous chemical applications) is treated with it.

6. In testing Letter #1, the chemist continues to apply those tests known to be effective in developing known PLS (Inks). (Those are, however, ELS inks for which we have no known developer). After such tests were exhausted without yielding any detection the sensitive process with the application of other tests. In all a total of 20 different chemical tests were applied. Additional ink was used over an area was left on the letter to apply ink.

7. None of these tests yielded even a trace of SW. These results appear to contradict the report submitted even sent vide Reference #3. We still believe that Before 71 should not be so interpreted. Because of the extreme fragility of SW, our failure to develop it notwithstanding.

8. As previously reported, Letter #2 was not treated, for reasons given in Reference #3. A facsimile of Letter #1 was made before unit taking its chemical treatment, the facsimile was check by a competent linguist and authentication specialist and found satisfactory.

9. FYI: Any information concerning the KEIFOLD test, including its existence, is considered extremely sensitive and should be so treated.

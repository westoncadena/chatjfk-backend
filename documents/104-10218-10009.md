MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, DO

SUBJECT : Operational Survey in Spain by Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

1. After considerable coordination, agreement was finally secured from EUR Division and COS/Madrid for Edward G. Tichborn (P) to undertake an operational survey in Spain. Chief and Deputy Chief EUR/IB plus the undersigned had a preliminary meeting with Tichborn on 20 June 1967. Background reading was provided him preparatory to a detailed briefing. The latter was effected by DC/IB and the undersigned on 21 June 1967.

2. Tichborn's mission is to identify operational targets, primarily in the business community but not excluding those in the military establishment, the Government, and the church, including Opus Dei. Identification is desired of elements, particularly in the business community, which have political influence now and which could be more important after Franco's death. After identifying such elements, Tichborn is to seek ways and means of access to them. He will, of course, pay particular attention to the local Spanish partners of ICAP Iberia in terms of their political activities and their contacts with key officials. He will assess ICAP Iberia as a cover mechanism, and in the event of a favorable assessment, explain in detail how it could be exploited. He will assess one of ICAP Iberia's local partners whose aunt was a famous RIS agent.

3. Tichborn is leaving New York on 24 June 1967 and will arrive in Madrid on the morning of 25 June 1967. He has been given the telephone number and address of DCCS/Madrid, Mr. Osborne Day, who will be his contact. Tichborn, upon arrival, will telephone Mr. Day. The latter has been alerted by WOFACT cable of Tichborn's arrival. WUBRIRY/1 will meet Tichborn in Madrid on 28 Jure and make appropriate introductions.

4. It is anticipated that Tichborn will spend about a month in Madrid or as long as it is commercially plausible and operationally necessary to fulfill his mission. Necessary commercial groundwork

has been laid. Tichborn recently met one of the Spanish partners in New York who was on a short visit to the U. S. They agreed that when Tichborn visited Spain, they would jointly work on a prospectus that could be used to increase business for ICAP Iberia.

5. It is estimated that Tichborn's trip will cost about $2,500.00. Approval is requested to obligate $2,500.00 of FY 67 00A or D&TO funds for this purpose.

## Description of Activity:

UOACE is a area-wide support project which provides funds to cover salary, travel and miscellaneous operational costs of MAM/LC, contract agent and political action costs. Tichborn has been used primarily as an advisor in CIM-connected election operatives throughout Latin America. From 1961 to August 1965 he served as Man- ies Party station in the development of a cultural magazine *Dialogue* and carried out spot assignments in other *Wilderness* areas. In August 1966, he was assigned TCU to New York City, and (as of October 1966) placed under cover as Latin American referent in the DO proprietaries, ICAP Corporation (WUBRINY Project). In the past year, he served briefly as advisor to a Santo Domingo Station asset (LANTHUM-4) and in an unsuccessful attempt to conduct an in-depth study of the PRI Party in Mexico. The present request coincides with LOD/assumption of Tichborn's support costs under Project WUBRINY as of 1 October 1967.

## Funding:

Since October 1956, UOACE funds have been passed to Tichborn un- der cover of the ICAP Corporation (Project WUBRINY).

## Interagency Coordination and approval:

U.S. Ambassadors in countries where Tichborn's services are uti- lized in special operations are briefed as appropriate and necessary re- garding his assignment. No State coordination or 303 Committee action.

EVALUATORY COMMENT:

1. Although Tichborn's services have not been fully utilized in the past, due primarily to the lack of continuing, regular requirements in the WH/I area. For his special capabilities, there continues to be a need to gain agent of his wide experience and talents in the political action field, particularly as ad hoc advisor and monitor in priority election operations.

2. The transfer of Tichborn from an exclusive WH/IID status under UOACE to a wider-ranging assignment under WUDRINY makes him available for DDP-wide use. Because of language and background experience, he will continue to be used primarily in Spanish language (primarily WH/I areas, but his ICAP employment status should also enable him to gradually expand his usefulness to other areas as well.

3. Recommend approval.

# REQUEST FOR FY 1968 PROJECT EXTENSION AND TERMINATION -- COACE

1. Total Funds Requested. $5,500

2. Account in which Project was included in the Operational Program for FV 1968. $920,250

3. Current Objectives. To support Contract Agent Edward G. TICHBORN (2) who is used as a covert action advisor and political action agent by WIID. In addition TICHEORN is available for election campaign research, special political surveys on selected countries and armed research requirements which can utilize his political expertise and area knowledge.

4. Background. In 1959 TICHBORN, a bilingual Harvard-trained lawyer with political experience, was hired as a political action advisor for Agency-sponsored election operations throughout Latin America. He has participated in political operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, Argentina and the Dominican Republic. Based in Mexico City from 1961 until 1963, he was primarily a Headquarters asset but also assisted the Mexico City Station in its CA program. In August 1966 he was assigned PCs to New York City where he has been employed for cover purposes since October 1966 by the DO proprietary WUSALINE. In order to maximize the benefits of his availability, he was sent to Puerto Rico to conduct a political action briefing of a Station: Santo Domingo asset, MANTLE-4, which task he performed effectively.

5. Effectiveness. During the period 1 October 1966 - 30 June 1967, WED has had an opportunity to use TICHEORY in his primary role of political action advisor on only one occasion. In February TICHEORN was assigned the continuing task of monitoring the Dominican Republic press and analyzing media reactions towards Balaguer and opposition elements. Several detailed summaries were submitted to the Dominican desk. A major effort was made to develop an in-depth study of the PRI party in Mexico. After a number of meetings with Headquarters and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

-2-

ico Chy Station officers and early enthusiasm on the part of
TICTHBORN'S PRI contacts, these contacts became reluctant to del
into Selative PRI areas or to introduce TICABORN to other contacts
wch inside access. In May Headquarters, the Station, and TICHEORN
all agreed, that the effort should be dropped.

## Cover and Security

a. Cover. TICKBORN has done an excellent job of building
and
is cover win WUSALINE, liis area knowledge and language
aidity have proven of real help to the cover company,
h.s shown himself unusually well suited to the needs of inat
company. The cover company demands on his time, both on-the
job and for foreign and domestic travel, have no: interiored with
his opera tional a calization.

b. Socerity. While in Mexico, TICHEORN acted as an
mofficial legal závisor for the Center of Studies and Documnemation
which was motioned in the MFDOWEL fiap as being bein funded by a
CIA condit. However, there ere was no publicity in Mexic Lexico wnien
linked in with the Comer. Similarly there was appar arently no
public ic exposure of the funding of the imellectual magazine with
WILCH was connected ted, "Dialogos", by other CIA condeks. There
is no available evidence that his security has been compromised
by the MilDOWEL Rap.

## Termination and Extension

2. While TICHBORN has been available for assignments caling
   for his abilities as a political action advisor, the Division has not
   had the requirements for such activities wiich were anticipated.
   The cominuing use of TICHSORN for CIA tasks of lesser priority,
   together with the time and travel demands of his new cover business,
   Lave kept hira weil occupied during the period. However, in view
   of the future anticipated lack of demand for TICHEORN's services
   on a frequent basis, and the comparatively high cost in administra-
   tive, financial, and WH case officer time required, it is felt that
   the project should be terminated, effective 30 September 1967.

b. As indicated in the sec ion above on "Cover and Security",
TICHEORN has proven himse to be of real value to his cover
company WUSALINE and to DO. Becaus e of their interest in using


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 21

-3-

him as a full-time asset, DO has agreed to assume full administrative and operational responsibility for TICHDORN, effective 1 July 1967. Responsibility for the fulfillment of TICHDORN'S contract (effective through 30 September 1967) will be transferred to DO, effective 1 July 1967.

INFO.

FROM: Chief of Station, Santo Domingo

SUBJECT: Operational/MHSPAWN/TICHBORN Press Analysis

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

Reference: HDCW - 2588

Action: FYI

The Station appreciates the press analysis contained in the Reference, which was prepared by Edward G. TICHBORN. We feel that TICHBORN's comments on the press image of EMANTHEM/1 are particularly useful. As Headquarters is aware, however, EMANTHEM/1 has not shown himself particularly willing to take strides to improve his press image and continues to manifest a rather callous disregard for principles of public relations in general. While thus of no real immediate use, a continuing TICHBORN analysis would prove valuable should the opportunity present itself to render EMANTHEM/1 public relations advice and aid. We also believe such an analysis would be worthwhile in that it would keep TICHBORN himself up to date on the Dominican situation. Should it be decided to offer EMANTHEM/1 direct public relations or political advice, TICHBORN, in view of his established rapport with this individual, would be a natural candidate for the job. We would therefore appreciate further TICHBORN analysis, if practicable and convenient.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, DO

VIA : Chief, DO/CO

SUBJECT : Edward G. Tichborn (P)

1. The undersigned on 23 May 1967 reviewed in WH Division Tichborn's 201 file (4 folders) and related operational files. Particular attention was given in this review to Tichborn's security.

2. The files reflect that Tichborn is very security conscious. There is no evidence that Tichborn was ever suspected of being a WOFACT operative.

3. Tichborn practiced law in California and was active in state and national politics. He was recruited as a political advisor on a part-time basis in 1959 by the CA Staff. In 1962, he was taken on full-time under contract by WH Division and assigned to Mexico City. His cover for this assignment was publishing and movie interests in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. In Mexico City he published a magazine, *Dialogos* aimed at left-wing intellectuals. The CI/OA staff review in 1965 stated that Tichborn's cover story was completely accepted by his friends and associates. The SGSWIRL of Tichborn in 1965 revealed that he had informed only his wife of his association with WOFACT.

4. The files reflect that Tichborn is very sensitive about security. He balked at working with a WOFACT officer in Mexico City, because a friend told Tichborn that the WOFACT officer not only was WOFACT but had openly admitted it to the friend. A proposed trip to Bolivia vas aborted because Tichborn felt there was no suitable cover.

5. Tichborn has traveled extensively in Latin America on training and election assigments. Three countries in which he worked are Chile, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. On these assignments Tichborn used his legal, publishing, and movie cover. It is understood that he also used alieses and disguises, although this was not noted in the quick review of the files. He can, of course, be debriefed in detail on this aspect.

6. The files show that Tichborn's magazine, *Dialogos* was funded through Tichborn by various individuals through arrangements made by CCS. The 12/WH/6 interrogated Tichborn on any foundation funding. Tichborn could recall only one instance of foundation funding, some $2-2,500 given *Dialogos* Editor Ramon Xirau by the Fairfield Foundation. There is also a reference in the files that one, Louis Mercier, was informed that ODACID also supported *Dialogos*.

7. The files reflect very favorably on Tichborn's performance - two reports by the Mexican Station and one from COS/Santo Domingo are most commendatory. On the negative side, administrative details bore him.

8. The undersigned has confirmed with Chief, WE/CA that if DO will take over Tichborn's contract, WH will pay Tichborn's salary and expenses for the first quarter of FY 1968. Chief, WH/CA is awaiting DO's decision.

9. The undersigned is very favorably impressed by Tichborn. By 1 October, it is believed that Tichborn will be sufficiently well-trained in commercial and investment banking matters to do legal-business consulting on a fee basis for WUSALINE. He should be able, depending on the number of operational requirements, to earn a part, if not all, of his salary. On this basis, it is recommended that DO assume administration of Tichborn effective 1 July 1966, with the understanding that WH Division will defray Tichborn's salary and expenses during the first quarter of FY 1968.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Contact Report, 8 May 1967

PARTICIPANTS: Edward G. TICHBORN, Stephen Chaconas, and Lee E. Patton

PLACE : Shoreham Hotel, 1230-1500 Hours

1. Preliminary meeting was in the hotel room but the bulk of the discussion took place during lunch and afterwards. The gist of the discussion with TICHBORN was as follows:

a. TICHBORN explained how he had been surprised at the sudden loss of interest by Antonio Menendez in the project and particularly in introducing TICHBORN to other contacts. TICHBORN says that the reason for this is Menendez' sudden recognition of the danger to his political future in even indirectly being connected with what could become a controversial book. TICHBORN attempted to develop various hypotheses for the revelation of this fear at this time rather than earlier in the negotiations. There was, however, no really clear explanation of why Menendez had so suddenly drawn into his shell.

b. TICHBORN was asked whether he felt that in some ways we were not "taken" by Menendez. He responded with considerable heat by saying that it was a calculated gamble that "just didn't pay off". He became very defensive when the discussion turned to the original evaluation of Antonio Menendez. He says that he is convinced that Menendez has the information as well as the contacts and in short was the right man but one who turned out to be unwilling to run the risks involved for the "small amount of money" he would be paid. TICHBORN attempted to make a strong case for his belief that Menendez was the right man and emphasized (somewhat apart from the point) that some day he will have an important post in a future PRI government. TICHBORN says the whole problem was discussed with Stan Watson who agreed that the project could not be


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

-2-

productive now due to the sudden reluctance of Antonio Menendez and Jose Luis Siqueiros to introduce TICHBORN to their contacts. Stan Watson also felt, according to TICHBORN, that it would be risky for TICHBORN to contact Gonzalez Casanova, Cholula and Urquidi. While details of the discussions between Watson and TICHBORN were not given, it seems that the decision not to proceed was reached without any major hassle between TICHBORN and Stan Watson. (Comment: TICHBORN appears to be not at all unhappy about terminating what could have become a long and unproductive research effort built on a shaky story of TICHBORN writing a book on the PRI.)

c. Antonio Menendez wrote up in English some of his comments based on his approach to the research problem. This 13 page double spaced report is attached.

d. Chaconas asked TICHBORN how well he knew Carlos Fuentes (for possible BGBERET targeting). TICHBORN replied that he knew him very well and that he felt he could approach him directly if he had a reason for being in Paris (vacation, for example) or wherever Fuentes is now living. TICHBORN said that he believed Fuentes would accept an assignment to write articles on North Vietnam based on a future visit to that area but he also indicated that he believed we could not control the tone of the articles which would be likely to be pro-North Vietnam.

2. TICHBORN was asked by LEP to review the list of trips TICHBORN had made outside the country and to confirm the dates and advances involved. LEP asked TICHBORN to get a list from his cover company of his domestic trips so that when the cover company submits a claim, WH will have a record of what trips were authorized for operational purposes involving TICHBORN. TICHBORN, on the same subject, said that he feels as does his cover company boss that some other arrangement should be made for some of his travel for WH. TICHBORN says he feels that the amount of travel he is involved in may appear unusual to the cover company accountant. LEP agreed that this was not a good situation over the long run and that he would talk to Gail Allen about making different arrangements for the future.

3. TICHBORN was requested to rebate the $171. 18 owed from the advance given him in Mexico for his trip there on 17 March. He offered to write out a check but LEP suggested that he send the check throughthe proper channels to the post office box number given him. He also promised to send the accounting for the latest trip to Mexico City in as soon as possible. TICHBORN was reminded of the need to send in his April and May loan payments which he agreed to do right away.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Outstanding Loan Account - Edward G. TICHBORN (P) Henry R. Lopez

1. In the attached informal note by Edward G. TICHBORN, he states that he recalls on or about September 10, 1966 that, in a meeting with several Agency representatives, he received tacit acknowledgement that there would be no problem for the temporary delay in his repaying of an outstanding account. None of the Agency representatives believed to have been present at this vaguely described meeting specifically recalls discussions of this outstanding account and specific arrangements for its handling. Nevertheless, it is believed quite possible that casual reference to it may have been made at one of the meetings with TICHBORN and either through misunderstanding or general oversight, the problem was not followed through, in that repayments are being made on a continuing regular basis in satisfactory manner. Its believed no further action is required provided that repayment continues at the rate of $125 per month as agreed until the advance is meet in full.

2. The purpose of this reno is to state the reason of non-payment during the period August 1986 - January 1967 and will be to document TICHBORN's loan account.

SUBJECT : Contact Report, 20 April 1967

PARTICIPANTS: Edward G. TICHBORN and Lee E. Patton

PLACE : Hotel Barbizon Plaza and Restaurant, 1945-2230 Hours

1. The following administrative details were discussed with TICHBORN:

a. The change in insurance premiums was explained. He is to pay $26.88 for his next premium and in the future will pay $25,89.

b. His income tax problems were discussed, and he feels the matter has now been arranged satisfactorily as a result of his trip to Washington to talk to WH/B&F officers.

c. In regard to Spain--he was told that the situation still has not been settled but that a decision is expected around the end of April

c. LEP requested a statement from TICHBORN with regard to his authorization to have a six month moratorium on his $125 a month loan payments. TICHBORN wrote out a statement per B&F's request. He also signed a certification for his recent trip to Mexico. LEP requested TICHBORN to give him a check for the rebate for his 17 March trip to Mexico of $171. 18. In response to a question as to how much he had paid Menendez, he said he had given him $500.

2. In a discussion on the objectives and plans for his 25 April trip to Mexico City, TICHBORN said he intended to contact the following: Menendez, Siqieros, Cholula, Casanova Gonzalez. He said he had called and confirmed specific meeting dates with Menendez and Siqieros. TICHBORN said he could not call Cholula and Casanova because such a long distance call would seem unusual to these acquaintances. TICHBORN says he believes a firm decision can be made re the possible success of

the PRI study as a result of this trip. He was told that lacking clear signs of progress, we would not consider sending him down again. He will be staying at the Hotel Del Paseo and will arrive the afternoon of 24 April for a week's stay. He will call Stan Watson when he arrives.

Copy of letter from Edward G. TICHBORN

"On or about September 10, 1966 I had a meeting with three or four gentlemen in Washington (as I recall, they were Jerry Droller, Jack Kaufman, Paull Kittredge and someone else) and I informed these gentlemen that my moving expenses had been considerably more than I had estimated. However, I told these gentlemen that rather than ask for an additional amount, I wished to serve a moratorium of loan payments for six months. One of these men (with a nod from &other) said "okay--don't worry about it-- just don't ask for an additional allotment. We'll take care of it. "

"At this point we moved on to another topic, and I assumed I would be allowed to skip payments for six (6) months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT : Request for Services of Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

1. Pursuant to exploratory discussions participated in by Mr. Allen of DO, Mr. Munger of EUR, and Mr. Patton of WH, your approval is requested to assign contract agent Edward G. TICHBORN (P) to Madrid for approximately three weeks TDY. DO would, of course, defray the expenses of Tichborn's trip.

2. As you know, Tichborn is provided cover in New York by DO's proprietary WUSALINE under Project WUBRINY. WUSALINE has an affiliate in Madrid. The operational potential of WUSALINE'S Spanish affiliate and that of its local directors has not been fully determined. DO, EUR and COS, Madrid, are interested in determining the access of the local directors to intelligence targets and in assessing the affiliate as a cover vehicle. As WUSALINE's officer concerned with Latin America, Tichborn is considered a logical choice from the cover viewpoint for this assignment. He also has considerable WOFACT experience, meets people easily, is fluent in Spanish, and is a graduate of the Harvard Law School. The latter fact is important, considering the legal background of the affiliate's local directors.

3. If you approve, it is envisaged that the operation will be closely coordinated by DO, EUR, and WH. COS, Madrid has concurred in a TDí by Tichborn and can provide on-the-spot guidance.

PLACE: Hotel Barbizon Plaza 1900-2200 hours, LEP's hotel room.

1. LEP reviewed in detail TICHBORN'S knowledge of the early funding of the magazine Dialogos. TICHBORN made the following comments:

a. The original $4,000 given him came from the Station, and there was no mention of any cover story or indication of the ultimate source of the funds.

b. With regard to the Farfield Foundation contribution to Dialogos, TICHBORN said that it did not go to him due to some mixup but did go to Editor Ramon Nirau. This amount was, he recalls, between $2,000 and $2,500.

c. TICHBORN replied in regard to his knowledge of any foundations having given support to Dialogos by saying that none did to his knowledge. The only sources he can recall were individuals including the following: Cass Carpfield; McEnroe; R. Strauss; Dowling; McKenna.

2. With regard to the PRI study on which the decision has been given on 28 February by Chief, WH/CA to go forward, LEP gave TICHBORN the following instructions:

a. He was asked to provide prior to his departure a pre-travel work plan which would include who he is going to see, where, and what he hopes to accomplish during this one-week stay in Mexico City. He agreed to submit this information prior to his departure. LEP told

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/DO

SUBJECT: Discussions with WH/6 re Possible Use of Edward G. Tichborn (P) in Spain

1. The undersigned lunched on 15 December 1966 with Mr. Lee Patten, the WH/6 Case Officer for Edvard G. TICHBORN (P), who is under VUSALINE cover in New York. Mr. Patten vas formerly COS Managua and now Deputy Chief, WH/6 under Mr. Paul Oberet. He 18 a very competent and conscientious cace officer. He believes that WH Division should get the most operational benefits possible from Tichborn, inasmuch as WE Division is paying Tich- born's salary. He is working diligently to come up with operationali assigmenta for Tichborn. Es has Tichborn working on two research projects and hopes to establish Tichborn as a political advisor to the Government of the Dominican Republic. Although WH Division is suffering budget cuts, which Mr. Patten levents, his project for Tichborn has been approved for one year and funds are available.

2. In view of Mr. Patten's conscientious approach as case officer for Tichborn and sove known parochialism in WH, the undersigned felt it unvico to press Mr. Patten for more than approval for Tichborn to make a 2-3 weeks trip to Spain. In fact, the undersigned had to present a considerable case for even this limited use of Tichborn. However, as a result, it is believed that Mr. Patten will support in WH Division a TDY in Spain for Tichborn of 2-3 weeks duration at DO expense. Mr. Patton will call the undersigned on 19 December, to report the WH position.

3. The undersigned seized upon the budget cut point to volunteer that DO would be amenable to helping out with Tichborn's salary if WH 18 hard pressed. Mr. Patten declined, inasmuch as his project is approved for one year. He hopes to get so many operational benefits from Tichborn that he will have no problem renewing the project next year. He did admit that DO's willingness to pay Tichborn's expenses and salary while on a TDY to Spain should help him sell the proposal to his superiors.

4. The undersigned pointed out that he had not yet approached the Spanish Desk on a TDY for Tichborn, because it was desired to

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 48

get WH Division's views as a first step. Mr. Patten said that in the event of WH approval of a TDY to Spain for Tichborn that he would like to participate with DO and the Spanish Desk in the briefing of Tichborn. The undersigned readily concurred. Mr. Patten thinks that Tichborn should not be a global asset but rather one limited to Latin America. However, he did concur with the undersigned that Spain represents an exception because of language and historical ties to Latin America. Mr. Patten strongly hopes Tichborn can be a political advisor to the Dominican Republic Government. He would not think of recommending to his superiors more than a 2-3 weeks TDY for Tichborn with the understanding that the advisor requirement has priority. The undersigned pointed out that DDP considers the Spanish requirement high priority, and that use of Tichborn for a TDY to Spain would surely be an important justification when project renewal time comes around.

5. It is hoped that WH's position will be favorable for a 2-3 weeks use of Tichborn in Spain. Any pressing of WH for use of Tichborn over a longer period is a matter of delicacy. The undersigned knows that WH feels they were coerced into accepting Project WUBRIHY. The undersigned would not recommend pressure. On the contrary, the undersigned has hoped to use Tichborn as a means of opening up Latin America for Project WUBRIKY.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact Report, 8 December 1205-1600 hours

PARTICIPANTS: Edward G TICHBORN and Lee E. Patton

PLACE: Hotel Hoosevelt and Charley Brown's Pub

1. TICHBORN arrived at the meeting site in the lobby five minutes late. We went up to the hotel room where the following business items were discussed.

a. He was told of his overpay of $872.37 which he said he would return at once by check to Manuel P. Goodtwo, mailed to Mr. William S. Rodgers, P. O. Box 101.46, Woodridge Station.

b. TICHBORN was reminded of the requirement that he pay his premiums of $3. 63 for his health insurance. He was told he owed for the period of October through January, and it was suggested that he pay by check directly to the above box. He was told that there was no expiration notice sent out on the premiums being due; hence, it was up to him to keep the matter current.

c. He was told that Finance was interested in obtaining his monthly payments of $125 in repayment of his loan of $3, 000. Apparently he had last paid in July. He requested an extention or moratorium through January 1967 due to his heavy expenses involved in moving.

d. TICHBORN was shown copies of the "White" FBIS publication. After he has looked at these, he will notify LEP as to whether he wants copies in the future mailed to the post office box which he has now obtained.

e. TICHBORN was told that the $575 which he had lost on a TDY trip about a year and a half ago has now been officially written off.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

-2-

f. TICHBORN was told NOT to use his pseudo, TICHBORN, on mail (LEP had received an envelope from TICHBORN which carried his pseudo on the outside as sender but had a phony address).

2. TICHBORN submitted his proposal on the PRI study which he estimated would cost $3,800. Since it did not have a research plan or outline, LEP requested him to send one as soon as possible. TICHBORN believes Menendez is indispensable and that his services are worth the $2,000 he has projected. TICHBORN feels that his plan is not as complete as it might be but would be of a very useful size and scope and could be completed in six months. LEP briefed TICHBORN on the peculiarities of our operational interest in research as contrasted to the traditional academic approach. TICHBORN seemed to understand these distinctions very clearly.

3. TICHBORN had a preliminary report entitled "Press Reaction to Balaguer". He said that last week he had finally found a newstand on 146th-Street where he could buy daily issues (only about a day late) of *El Caribe, Listan Diario* and *Ahora*.

4. LEP briefed TICHBORN on our (WH) reluctance to send him on ICAP missions to other areas. He indicated that he had not heard of the Spanish trip from John. He quickly said that he thought such a trip was justifiable from the standpoint of Spanish relations with Latin America, etc. etc.

5. He agreed that he would be of very limited use for ICAP in other areas and said that he had so informed Train when such travel had been proposed earlier.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, DO

SUBJECT: Spain

REF:

A. DO memorandum 66-264 dtd 1 Nov 1960 to Chief, EUR Division re Possible Exploitation of ICAP, Iberia S. A.

B. Memorandum dtd 8 November 1966 from Chief, DO to Mr. Oale W. Allen re Information about Spain (and Portugal)

1. Chief and DC/E/IB informed the undersigned that Chief, EUR does not think Ref A contains sufficient specific information to permit adequate evaluation of ICAP Iberia's access to intelligence targets in Spain. He, therefore, refuses to permit transmittal to the field of available information as agreed in discussions held with DC/COS Madrid prior to his departure. They also informed the undersigned that the requirements in Ref B should be more specific and requested that the undersigned discuss the matter with them.

2. The undersigned had previously discussed Ref B requirements with WUBRINY/1. He submitted a list of U. S. firms operating in Spain; a previous report on the ten leading Spanish banks with the interlocking connections in industry of the officers and directors of the banks; and a proposal for additional study. WUBRIENY/1 proposed that, in the guise of publishing a financial directory, ICAP approach U. S. firms operating in Spain and obtain detailed information on their operations. WUBRIENY/1 also proposed to approach ICAP Iberia's Spanish partner, Banif S. A, allegedly in behalf of a client bank interested in Spain, to do a study from the political viewpoint on the most significant power elements in the economic and commercial field. He said that the study could be as elaborate as WOFACT is willing to pay. The undersigned, armed with WUBRIKY/1's thinking and list of U. S. companies, met with Chief and DC/E/IB at their request on 30 November 1966.

met 3. Chief and DC/E/IB asked some very specific questions on the access of Banif, S.A. either as a firm or through its Directors to in.elligence targets. They must be in a position to justify to the satisfaction of Chief, EUR that ICAP and ICAP Iberia have intelligence capability which can be operationally exploited. Therefore, answers must be forthcoming on this matter or DO assure thee that Banif, S. A. has such access but can't exploit it unless an officer is assigned to ICAP Ibaria.

4. The principal questions asked are listed as follows:

a. What are the normal commercial relations, if any, between Ranif, S. A. and the Spanish Coverument?

b. If such relations exist, give details. Now did the commercial relations arice? Was it because of commercial reasons or relations between individual Banif Directors and officials of the Spanish Goverment? If the latter, what is the nature of the relationshipî Was it friendship or under-the-table deals such as kickbacks, rebates, etc. Describe ench Danff-Spanish government deal giving the substance, participants, and arrangements?

c. Does Banif, S.A. or its Directors have connections with any political group, either in the regins or in the opposition? Does it contribute funds to any political groupi

d. Does Benif have any deale with the military on arms and equipment? If so, give details.

e. What are the specific projects Berif has vorised on in the past two years, either for its cum account or the acccant of others. Give details.

i

8. What information aces Benif have, or a capability for obtaining, on Spain's economic, industrial, and finencial situation as it might affect a post-Franco Goverment.

5. Bo Ref B requirements, Chief and DC/E/IB affirmed interest in the most significent power elesants in the econonde or commercial field in Spain, particularly those having political ties. They are Interested not in all U. 6. firms operating in Spain, but in those which are politically conscious and have the capability by virtue of size or nature of vort to influence political life in Spain. For example, a small V. 8. firm raising chickens in Spain is of no interest. Conversely, the Bank of America in the banking field or Brown & Root in the construction field or a U. S. firm comifacturing military equipment could be of great interest. In these firms with a capability to influence Spanish political life, the Chief and DC/E/IB vould be interested in knowing the U. S. managers in Spain who deal with the Spanish cuthorities.

6. The undersigned asked, and Chief and DC/E/IB agreed, to send Chief, Do their specific requirements on a formal basis. Chief and DC/E/IB opined that Project WUBRIKY appears to have the best capability for Spain and Project WMIENTREE for Portugal.

7. The undersigned, on 1 December 1966, apprised VURINY/1 of the specific nature of the Spanish Desk requirements, inasmuch as WURINY/1 could go to Spain while on his current trip to Europe. SUBRDY/1 said that answers to such specific questions would require someone spending considerable time on the spot. He could not spend the time, but suggested that WH contract agent, Edvard O. TICHBORN (P) be made available for two weeks assignment with ICAP, Iberia. WUMRIRY/1 noted that Tichborn is fluent in Spanish and an experienced hand in ferreting out such information. Moreover, it would be perfectly natural for Tichborn to visit ICAP Iberia prior to undertaking commercial ventures in Latin America. A visit by Tichborn would be very logical from a training viewpoint and in the light of the traditional ties between Spain and Latin America.

8. The undersigned concurs with WUBRILEY/1 that Tichborn would be an excellent means of obtaining the desired information. Subject to WH Division's operational demands on Tichborn, it is hoped that WH Division would make him available for a couple of weeks. This matter can be developed further when WURRIRY/1 returns free Europe and it is determined whether Tichborn will be needed for a two weeks training job in the Dominican Republic.

SUBJECT: Edward G. TICHBORN--Salary Overpayment; Payment of Contract Hospitalization Insurance Premiums

SECRET

1. The following pertains to a salary overpayment to Edward G. TICHBORN and procedure for payment of his Contract Hospitalization Insurance premiums.

2. It is requested you advise T:

a. Although full salary for October, 1966 was paid him by his cover office, Headquarters payroll erroneously sent the amount of $872.37 to his bank representing his October salary.

T is to liquidate the overpayment by forwarding his check in the amount of $881. ($872.37 plus 8.63 insurance premium) payable to Manuel P. GOODTWO.

b. As T, beginning with October, receives full salary from cover, it will be necessary for him to provide payments to Headquarters for his contract hospitalization insurance. The monthly premium is $8.63.

It is suggested that premium payments be made on a quarterly basis beginning with the period Oct 66 - Jan 67 inclusive. Subsequent quarterly payments should be made during the last month of the preceding quarter. Check should be made payable to Manuel P. GOODTWO.

If T indicates quarterly payments are inconvenient, he may pay in any multiple of one month in advance. In such case, the initial payment must be for two months (Oct and Nov). Subsequent payments should be made in advance of the month for which premium is due (premium for Dec should be received during Nov, etc.).

Advise T that expiration notices are not sent.

c. The above checks should be forwarded to this office for processing.

d. If you desire for T to send the checks directly to me, the following sterile address may be used (let me know if he is to use).

Mr. Gale Allen

10 November '66

Dear Gale,

Just received this from Bill Renehan who in turn got it from the tax man who recently saw TICHBORN (o/a 8 November) in order to straighten out his tax responsibilities and to have him sign his new contract amendment. The amendment will be sent over to you by WH/Contracts shortly. Let's get together on this shortly--call me about Tuesday and maybe we can have lunch together near your shop.

MEMO: To ICAP Directors

FACH: Train and Lopez

IN RE: Projected trip through Latin America

Bearing in mind that our executive committee may (at some future but presently undetermined date) desire Lopez to undertake in-depth surveys of economic conditions in certain Latin American countries, we consider it highly desirable to establish prior contacts with the banking and business communities of several selected areas which are most likely to offer ICAP sound investment opportunities. Our past experience indicates that it is much easier to assess spontaneous financial ventures if one is already acquainted with the business ambiance of a particular country. Thus, having previously touched base with local bankers and industrialists, Lopez would have the advantage of thier personal advice in matters relating to any specific subsequent projects.

The countries that would seem to offer the most promising opportunities for ICAP are PERU, CHILE, ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, BRAZIL and VENEZUELA. Fortunately, we have already established certain minimal ties with most of these countries, but it would be best for Lopez himself to become personally acquainted with our contacts therein.

In order to save time and money, it would be advisable to visit all these countries in a single round-the-hemisphere


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 61

trip. Taking into account the normal travel delays, the trip would require about eighteen (18) days.

Budget requirements:

1) Airline fares - $550 per person.
   This is Pan American Airlines special "winter fare." Normally, the trip costs $840 per person.

2) Lodging, food and minimal entertainment expenses - about $35 daily per person.:
   Total for each person would be about $630.

3) Miscellaneous expenses (cab fares to and from airports, in-town cab fares, phone calls, secretarial costs, etc.) - about $100.

Since the month of December is generally a slow business period in most of these countries, we would suggest that this trip be made in the month of January, 1967.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Contact Report, 26 October

PARTICIPANTS: (1) Edward G. TICHBORN, John P. C. Train,
Gaft Allen, and Lee E Patton

(2) TICHBORN, Allen, and Patton

PLACE : (1) Train's apartment at 7000 Park Avenue, 1500-1730 hours.

(2) Mannie Klein's Restaurant 1730-2000 hours

1. During the meeting at Train's, the majority of the discussion cenetered around ICAP, the trip to Central America and CIA/DO relations with ICAP. The following points of interest were gleaned in this period.

a. Train is a highly-trained promoter who is coldly reserved and capable. IHe seems to be generally pleased with TICHBORN and his capabilities for serving the firm as legal advisor, contact man, and unofficial economic consultant on economic matters.

b. TICHBORN likes his cover company, Train, and the work itself.

c. Train, if let alone, would use 100% of TICHBORN's time. When he brought this up, LEP used it as a starting place for briefing on the general nature of TICHBORN's functions of the past. Train was told that he would need TICHBORN for "research activities" in addition to any use involving special trips to Latin America. Не was told we would need 50% or more of TICHBORN's time to carry out these activities. It was pointed out to him that because of the nature of TICHBORN's services, we would have to insist that he be available for immediate use and hence could not be on any long-range Train projects which would be difficult to drop. Train accepted these limitations without visable annoyances or objections.

d. Tichborn says his office cover is good and there are no indications that he is not accepted for what he purports to be.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 64

-2-

*TRHIN*
TICHBORN concurs in this estimate of the lack of security problems within the office.

2. After leaving Train, we went to dinner where the following subjects were discussed:

a. LEP pointed cut clearly that he was "the boss" and responsible for TICHBORN's operational utilization. TICHBORN was told that Galt is responsible for the Train commercial setup. There appeared to be no doubt in his mind as to who calls the shots.

b. TICHBORN was told of our need for an experienced Latin American specialist who could handle political action research on key issues in certain countries. He was also told of our interest in possible CA covert action advisory tasks. Our need for someone able to make meaningful interpretive analyses was explained in some detail and examples of probable areas and issues were presented. TICHBORN said he had no special experience in content analysis or survey analysis techniques. However, he was apparently very much interested in the idea. He said that he would get the book suggested on content analysis. He will check into the availability of the Dominican Republic papers mentioned and let LEP know by 5 November if they can be had in New York City. He was requested to approach the problem along the general following lines: Analyze the Bosch anti-government statements for indications of whom he is trying to reach, how, and for what reason (since June 15). Similarly analyze the Balaguer statements and determine:

1) Influences the news media is having on his public image.

2) Where and how could he strengthen this image.

3) What issues should be raised or surpressed.

It was suggested that the try to get issues of *El Caribe* and *Listin Diario*.

3. LEP's initial impressions of TICHBORN were as follows: He is very intelligent and in addition is "sharp". He has a professionally smooth and friendly manner. He is a natural politican. He is an "operator" and will collaborate very closely and enthusiastically so long as there is real benefit in it for him. He is probably sensitive to his Mexican-American ancestory as indicated by his obvious annoyances (albeit presented jokingly) at the fact that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 65

-3-

he has not been invited out to lunch by any members of Train's company in the six weeks he has worked there. He is probabiy not a detailed man and is impressed by social position and wealth and consequently likes to function on a high level. Although there is no real reason to believe that TICHBORN may see another career ahead, LEP feels there is a possibility that Train will try to hire him for his company or he may make contacts in New York City which could lead to his getting a non-CIA job.

7. Interagency Coordination:

1. To cover a project designed to expose Communist infiltration in CO. C. (e.g., as a political action consultant).

2. It replaces an earlier, now-terminated, project. This new cover will, under which
   FCO was funded by special allocations from the contingency fund. The now cover is to cost $15,000 to $20,000 monthly, and $15,000 from 1 October 1963 to cover the transitional and operational/ logistical funding.  Funds for the original Program contain in it the Operational Program contingency Zunds at the end of FY 1967.

3.  ICO has served CIA as a political action agent in
    Honolulu, Mou City, Mexico City since 1961. His work there concentrated primarily on the development of a cultural magazine, and Calechia. He has carried out spot assignments in oor 1, usually as a top-level consultant in education, and is a persistent leftfact monopoly of the Dominican Republic

4.  From time to time he has also carried out spot assignments (c.c., in support of special elections).

5.  In August 1963 71CU was obliged to leave himself and his
    to the United States for personal reasons. The UNCO
    project catches his under a FCP Corporation in
    Mmmy, which is
    201
    1/ Mou City, a DOD Proprietary for project
    econding its activities in Latin America. Under this cover, FOR, TECHN-11 continues to be available on short notice for a variety of political action (election-target Soc) assignments, as in the past.

C's unique ability to serve CIA objectives in-87 critical citations has been amply commented. The new cover a
C.I
cent and COS MUSALING angears well suited, in terms of flexi- bility and backstopping, to enable CIA to continue to utilize TICH- Don's services in the future. Recommend approval.

# PROJECT COACE

a. Identification. Base - New York City. Political Action Support.

b. Objectives. To support contract agent Edward G. TICHEORN (P) who will be used as a covert action advisor and political agent by MD. In addition, TICHEORN will be available for election campaigns and political action advisor for election campaigns and political surveys on selected countries and other allied research.

c. Background. In late 1959, TICHEORN, a bilingual Harvard-trained lawyer with considerable domestic political experience, was hired as a agency-sponsored election advisor for agency-sponsored election operations in Latin America. In 1961 he became a full-time contract agent assigned to Mexico City, under personal cover, with permission to travel regularly on third country political action assignments. He has participated in political operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile and the Dominican Republic. While based in Mexico he was primarily a headquarters asset in addition to an excellent job for Mexico City Station in establishing and running a magazine aimed at Latin American intellectuals, and second, reporting on the activities and attitudes of Mexican intellectuals. TICHEORN has shown himself to be a very intelligent, outgoing American-American with initiative and energy who has highly developed political sensibilities.

This project is being presented to cover the salary and operational expenses of Contract Agent Edward G. TICHEORN.

d. Operational Aspects.

(1) Personnel. Edward G. TICHEORN was granted Operational Approval No. C-77119 on 14 October 1959, and this clearance was extended on 8 November 1965.

TICHBORN departed Mexico City on 1 August 1966 for PCS assignment to New York City where he will be employed for cover purposes by the DO proprietary WUSALINE. WUSALINE is expanding its activities into the Latin American area and can readily utilize the legal/economic background and area knowledge which TICHEORN


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

-2-

AICHLORN initially will devote a substantial time to his duties at WUSALINE for cover-building purposes but will be available for Agency assignments on short notice. It is planned Agency/TICHEORN relationship with the exception of WUBRINY-1, WUBRINY-2 and WUBRINY-II of the WUSALINE project to stay other persons or organizations intune U.S. witting of the principal agent

TICHBORN will enter on duty with WUSALINE on 1 October 1600.

(2) Mechanisms. The WUSALINE mechanism operates as a subsidiary of the Investment firm of WUSALIFY and is a DO proprietary. Arrangements for the use of WUSALINE by WII Division have reen coordinated with the DO office conce.ned.

e. Security Examation. It is estimated that the danger of a security comm.proa.ice in this project is minimal. TICHEORN will be involved in cover activities in WUSALINE which fit his academic and area interests and experience. WUSALINE nas a well-established cover as a part of the bona fide WUSALIFY company and his had no security problems which could adversely effect the cover provided: TICHBORN.

There are no known security risks which could have been passed on from msigm informer cover in Mexico City as a consultant with a Me Legal firm. The now WUSALINE cover arrangements will strengthen TICHEORN's cover security by permitting the income backstopping and the operational and travel flexibility required in his assignment.

In the event of compromise, TICHBORN probably would be discharged from WUSALINE in order to minimize the damage to that mechanism. Depending on the gravity of the compromise, steps might be taken by WUSALINE to disavow TICHEBORN to protect the cover mechanism and WUSALIFY.

An LCFLUTTER test in May 1965 indicated that TICHEBORN had told no one other than his wife of his relationship with the Agency.

f. Coordination. Coordination outside the Agency is not necessary.

TOTAL $ 16,000

The agent will be funded as follows:

(1) Overt salary and necessary cover travel expenses will be paid by WUSALIND on a monthly basis.
(2) WH Division will make funds available to DO to cover TICHBORN's salary. DO will pass these funds to WUSALINE through existing funding channels.
(3) Operational expenses will be reimbursed by the case officer directly to the agent.
(4) The Agent will conform to Agency requirements in all his accountings.

h. Annexes. None of the special considerations listed under this heading is applicable to this project.

SUBJECT: Edward G. Tichborn

1. Contract Agent Edward G. Tichborn, formerly assigned to Mexico City Station, departed that post on 1 August 1966. Effective that date he has been assigned PCS to New York City, New York, to carry out political action tasks as required by WH Division and other operational components of the Agency. While located in New York City, he will be employed for cover purposes by the DODS proprietary WUSALINE.

2. Incident to this transfer, WH Division has agreed with Tichborn to an increase in salary to $17,000 and a new contract reflecting this amount as the new gross salary should be prepared to be effective 1 October 1966. The new contract should include a salary offset clause to insure there will be no duplication of payment and reflect the various hospitalization and insurance benefits included in the existing contract.

3. Salary payments through 30 September and other costs arising from his transfer from Mexico City to New York City should be charged to Project LICOLIC. A new project reflecting the increase in salary will be prepared by Branch 6 to be effective as of 1 October 1966, and salary as well as other operational expenses incurred subsequent to that date should be charged to the new project. WH Division Branch 6 will have responsibility for project management as of 1 October.

Tax Assessment - Edward C. TICHBORN - #340535

REF: HRMT - 6611 dated 6 May 1966

1. Transmitted herewith is T/A BO-0273 dated 2 August 66 in the amount of $147.34, which represents tax withholding adjustment for Edward C. TICHBORN for the period 1 December 1965 through 31 July 1966.

2. Upon receipt of reference and the tax assessment percentages from the Tax Committee, Finance was able to clear Subject's tax accounts for the years 1963, 1964 and 1965.

3. A breakdown of the 1966 adjustment is as follows:

Subject has been assessed at the rate of 11.9% for 1966. For the period 12/1/65 - 7/31/66, Headquarters has withheld $1108.09, but the new assessment is only $1041.25 (11.9% of gross salary of $8750.00), thus a refund due Subject in the amount of $147.34. Therefore, it is requested that the Station pay TICHBORN the $147.34, and also beginning with the salary due for the month of August 1966 please pay Subject, and T/A to Headquarters the following net salary:

| GROSS    | GTMS    | TAX     | BDMP  | NET      |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| $1000.00 | $250.00 | $143.75 | $3.63 | $1002.02 |

4. It was noted by Headquarters, that the Station is still withholding FICA for 1966. The Station should have made a deduction of $14.70 in the month Pay, which would give TICHBORN maximum credits ($277.20) for 1966. Therefore, it is requested that the Station refund Subject any FICA that was withheld after a deduction of $14.70 for May, and please note this adjustment in the next T/A to Headquarters.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Central Cover Staff, Non-Official Cover

SUBJECT: Cover for Edward G. Tichborn

1.  Edward G. Tichborn, a Contract Agent, is presently assigned to Mexico Station under non-official, personal cover. He is in Mexico ostensibly as a consultant with a Mexican legal firm and acts as editor/publisher of a left-wing intellectual publication, Dialogos. He has requested reassignment to the United States, preferably the East Coast and particularly the New York City area. WH Division has concurred in his request to leave Mexico City in mid-August 1966 and desires to arrange suitable cover which would permit rapid disengagement at any time from regular day-to-day cover duties to undertake temporary duty assignments throughout Latin America at the request of this Division.

2.  WH Division in its investigation of cover possibilities discussed the problem with Mr. Stanley Gaines, DO/H, Mr. Robert Fallow, CA/3 and air. Gale Allen, DODS. Mr. Gaines investigated the possibility of Tichborn's assignment to the Domestic Operations facility in New York but the New York office did not believe it could devise suitable cover; ir. Fallow checked on the possibility of inserting Tichborn into two of the Covert Action Staff run operations in the New York area but these were finally judged as not providing the necessary flexibility; and finally, as you have seen in cable traffic, Mr. Allen came up with a possibility of assigning Tichborn to WUSALINE,

3.  On the basis of information made available by Mr. Allan, WH Division believes the WUSALINE proposal has merit and wishes to develop this cover proposal further. It would appear that a satisfactory resolution at this time ultimately rests upon WH Division agreement with Tichborn on terms of his contract, primarily salary, and WUSALINE agreement that Tichborn's back- ground is of sufficient depth to provide a modicua of credibility and his personality is of such a nature that he would be compat- ible with the principal agent. This will be resolved after Labor Day when Tichborn will be in the United States and the WUSALINE principal agent will have returned from a vacation which he is starting about 1 August. In the meantime, in com- pliance with regulations for the establishment of non-official cover, the following background information is provided concerning Tichborn and is keyed to your memorandum, "Non-Official Cover Request":

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 87

SECRET

A. General Information:

1) Edward G. Tichbora. Central cover has been
   queried concerning possible covers to be used
   by him for a number of TDYs in Latin America
   as well as for his original location in Mexico.

2) Contract Agent; $12,000 per annum with a housing
   allowance at present of $3,000. His contract
   is now under review.

3) He is fit for overseas duty.

4) To the knowledge of officers presently available
   in the WE Division, he has always operated
   under personally arranged, non-official cover.
   However, the Central Cover Staff has provided
   a non-attributable funding channel for transfer
   of KOBARK funds to the Tichborn operations on
   a number of occasions. This information should
   be available in Central Covor Staff files.

5) Approximately 1 September 1966.

6) Mid-August 1968.

7) There is no project at present. Authority for
   the relocation of this individual will be
   included in orders transferring him from Mexico.
   Following this and his establishment under the
   proposed WUSALINE or other cover, a project
   will be written.

7) Not known.

8) Extensive travel in Latin America and Caribbean area both privately and under KUBARK sponsorship (sec attached Memorandum).

9) Bi-lingual in Spanish and has a santtering of French, German and some Portuguese.

C. Security Considerations:

1) KUBARK employment initiated in 1959 and he has maintained this association since then. Security approval was last granted by KUDESK/OA on 8 November 1965. This approval was given for his use in "...publishing and furnishing intellectual guidance re *Dialogos* magazine and furnishing FI information on the intelligentsia of Mexico." Apparently derogatory information, developed or provided by Tichborn, was resolved in an LCYLUTTER given in Mexico City on 14 May 1965, a copy of which is available in his 201 file.

2) He is aware that he is in the employ of KUBARK.

3) Not known.

4) In LCPLUTTER it was revealed that his wife was the only individual to whom he has revealed his relationship with KUBARK.

It is not planned to make any other individual or organization in the United States witting of the KUBARK/Tichbora relationship with the exception of the principal agent of the WUSALINE Project.

2) Location: New York City.

3) He should be sufficiently mobile to permit his travel to any country in the world, but particularly Latin America and Africa.

4) Any strata of commercial or political life in Letin America or Africa.

5) Contract is presently being negotiated but his salary will be on the $12,000 to $15,000 level.

6) Cannot be judged at present.

7) Not known at present. However, communications for this type operation is usually directly to and through the Chief of Station.

8) As noted above, the WUSALINE.cover would appear to be excellent for Tichborn.

BIOGRAPHIC DATA SHEET - EDWARD G. TICHBORN

1. Edward G. Tichborn, 46, is bilingual and has a wide range of business and social contacts throughout Latin America. Following graduation from liarvard Law School in 1948, Tichborn became affiliated with a law firm in Los Angeles which represented wany Latin American corporations with California business connections. In the mid-1950's he became active in California State politics and served in various capacities in Democratic Party state and national organizations. he participated actively in the California gubernatorial campaign of James Roosevelt, the senatorial campaign of Helen Gahagan Douglas and both the 1952 and 1956 Stevenson campaigns for the presidency. He has been President of the Southern California Young Democrats, a member of the California Democratic State Central Committee, a member of the Host Committee for the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the Board of Directors of the National Democratic Minority Conference. In 1960 he served as Los Angeles coordin- ator of the Kennedy Movement for Americans of Mexican Extraction which, it is reported, contributed substantially to the success of the Kennedy campaign in Southern California. His only try for elective office was in 1958 when he was defeated in his bid for the position of California Secretary of State.

2. In late 1959, Tichborn was hired by the Agency as a political action advisor for Agency-sponsored election operations throughout Latin America. In 1961 he became a fulltime contract agent and was assigned to Mexico City, under personal cover, to establish a degree of security and mobility which would permit him to travel readily on third country political action assignments. Since the beginning of his relationship with the Agency, he has participated in Agency-sponsored political operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile and the Dominican Republic.

3. Tichborn has contributed stories, articles and inter- views to a variety of United States publications. An interview by Tichborn of Catherine Anne Porter, Pulitzer prize winner, appeared in a recent edition of Harpers and a Tichborn essay concerning the cultural dichotomy under which Mexican Americans exist, will appear in an early edition of the American Heritage publication. He is working on a series of articles and a book on the population problem in Latin America and is considering a book on Mexican political institutions, particularly the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PEI).

4. At present Tichborn runs a Mexico Station funded left wing intellectual publication (LIREAM). His cover in Mexico is nominal and he attributes his presence and activities primarily to his connections in the legal field through his former partner's law firm and his own intellectual interests.

Memo For C/J/CA

Subject: Tichborn Enployment

In follment to our conversation of 30 June, I contacted Stan Gaines of DO/H and Srecnce Braham of C1/3 on 30 June; Bob Fallow of Ca/3 on 5 and 6 July; and Gale Allen of DO Jashin on 6 July.

Covert Action Staff:

Braham had indicated a possibility there might be a slot open for Tichborn with a "publishing company" which Ca/3 controls in New York and he said that he would discuss it with Fallow upon the latters return from New York on 1 July. Fallow on 5 and 6 July concluded that this would not be good cover since they were eventhen planning to terminate that project. Fallow then said that he would investigate other possibilities, incl ding CTT, and let me know within a couple days. He also inlicated that he would discuss Tichborn with his front office and see what Cord Heyer might have flinring about in the back of his head which might be applicable to this problem. He inlicated some interest in the CRATR possibility and, while pointing out Tichborn's background is primarily Latin American and JUSTE at present does no business in Latin America, he said that he would investigate this more closely and be in touch with me.

Domestic Ops Headquarters:

Stan Gaines stated that Rudy Gomez and rir Dasilva, with when he had discuss ed the possibility of Tichborn's employment in New York indicated that as far as the Unic on tingent was concerned, they did not believe that they could use him. Rudy described him, from personal relationship in Santiago, as a "cowboy tyne operator" who would not fit into the UN Station act 'vity. Dasilva anmarently was non-committal. Following Gaines return from New Yrok, he said that he had planned on talking with Tracey Barnes concerning Tich but had not had a chance as yet. Howeve he will discuss with Barnes and let us know as soon as possible concerning an investment firm which they have a concoction with in New York

I gave him a general outline of his education and experience on the phone --Allen expressed a good deal of amazement concerning this sketch because apparently his principal pretty much followed the same educational and job experience trail as had Tich, e.g. Harvard Law School '48 or '49, private practice with small firm; intellectual leaning and ultimate connection with a Paris intellectual magazine.

Al'en said that he would be in touch with me on 8 July to let me know about the results of his preliminary soundings are

TO
Chief of Station, Mexico City

FROM
Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT
Edward O. TICHBORN

ACTION REQUIRED: See below

REFERENCE: A. SDOM-1020
B. MEXI-6828

1. Edward G. TICHBORN spent June 1 and 2 in the Headquarters area and departed the morning of 3 June for an overnight stop in Dallas before his return for Mexico City. Prior to his departure, TICHBORN was advanced $100 which will be Tad to the Station for final accounting.

2. During his stopover here, he met with representatives of the Dominican Republic Desk as well as DYVOUR Staff and Mexico Branch personnel. In these debriefings we touched specifically on his activities in connection with the Dominican Republic election; his estimate of the outcome of this election; his plans for the future, particularly his departure from Mexico; the termination of LIREAM; and his proposal for the contimuation of his relationship with KUBARK.

a. Dorminican Republic Flection:

Although TICHBORN painted a rather bleak picture of the possible results of the election, his comments concerning the situation pertaining at the time of his departure from the island contributed to Readquarters understanding of developments in the daye immediately preceding the election and on the election day. The DYVOUR Staff representative and the Dominican Republic Branch representatives specifically commended TICHRORN for the excellent work he had done during his temporary assignment to the Dominican Republic in connection with this election operation.

b. TICHBORN Future:

We discussed TICHBOPN's personal situation and desires for the future at some length. Although not being able to offer specific promises of long-term employment on his terms at this time, we advised him that the Agency would probably have recurring requirements, albeit relatively infrequent, for a man with his talents and experience. However, the limited requirement for such specialized activity in the DYVOUR area

would probably requi re a broadening of his horisons to include under- taking activities in response to requirements from non-DYWUR areas. TICHBORN indicated some reservation concearing this point as well as stating a definite lack of interest in TDI assignments which would require him to be away from his family for protracted periods.

c. Cover and Access:

TICHBORN explained his present thinking concerning a seminar-type political action service for which, in his mind, there is a definite requirement and which, incidentally, he considered himself eminently qualified to provide in the DYVOUR area. This would consist primarily of the same type direct contact with candidates which be carried out in the recent election in the Dominican Republic. In this, he envisions a short TDY, about six to nine months before an election, to assist in the establishment of a candidate'e pachine as well as the salection and training of his pricipal assistants; another short visit about two months before the election to assist the candidate and his assistants in defining issues and refining strategy; and a last short visit, about two weeks before the election, to assist in planning last minute tactics for the final week of the campaign. To provide cover for such a service, TICHBORN proposed that he establish a commercial office of some sort in New York. Through this office he would establish relations with commercial clients whom he would propose to represent on business (cover) travels trhoughout the DYVOUR area. Failing the actual establishment of these ties, he proposes to construct a fictional Cumonial relationship with various national companies which would ostensibly offer goods or services of interest to residents of the DYOUR areas. While expressing interest in both the service and the cover concept, we asked that TICHBORN prepare a paper on his specific proposal and forward it to Headquarters for more detailed study. No commitment was made by Headquarters and none was implied. In fact, a number of the problems and weaknesses of the proposal were pointed out and a specific KUBARK disinterest in under. writing the establishment or maintenance of the commercial cover required for such a venture on a contiming basis was noted.

d. Termination of LIRPAM

The problems which might arise from the termination of LIFEAM were investigated rather perfunctorily since TICHBORN, needless to say, wаз more interested in discussing the results of the Dominican Republic alection and his oun future with KUBARK. However, TICHBORN does not foresee any major problem arising in the termination. According to hin, there is no real contractual relationship with his co-editor (Identity) which would require reimbursement; there is no office equipment or other major physical or overhead investment which would require sale or other disposition; in accordance with Mexican law he will be required to pay a termination bonus to his secretary but this should not be very large; and, to his knowledge, there are no outstanding bills or commitments of which we are not presently aware. TICHBORN was told of the deposit of $1,500, requested in Ref. B, which should be in his account now, and he promised to forward drafts of two letters to be mailed from New York and Denver to cover the deposit of these funds. Headquarters would appreciate early receipt of the draft letters as well as some sort of schedule for a logical and phased termination of the LIREAM subsidy.

3. Headquarters will be interested in seeing the promised outline and any refinement of the commercial cover and election seminar concept which TICHBORN might develop and requests that the Station follow up on his agreement to prepare such a paper for transmittal to Headquarters. We are still investigating the requirements in other Divisions for the type expertise offered by TICHBORN and, following receipt of his written proposal, we will be better able to come up with a definite decision concerning what form the TICHBORN/KUBAEK relationship might take in the future. In the meantime, be assured that no speciic commitment for continued employment or subsidy of relocation or resettlement costs were made during TICHBORN'S TDY.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

FEVO:

FROM: Tichborn

IN RE: Proposed activities in New York

1. Establish cover position:

Since much of my activity would involve travel to foreign countries, I should establish a nosition with some organization involved in international business. I would strongly suggest that I try forming an association with Bernard McKenna, who has an international law practice. He has helped in funding *Dialogos*, so I would assume that he might be willing to cooperate. Should you agree, I could nop up to New York and set up the details with him personally. Ted Prounis, who helped in the Volman-Alba deal, is another possibility.

2. Proposed activities:

a) Continue election-aid trips such as Dominican Republic, Chile and San Salvador trips

Would strongly suggest, in view of my past experiences, that we approach these missions on broader range and in greater depth. Suggest the following:

(1) One-week survey at least six months before election.

(2) Campaign work-shop with candidate and his campaign staff at some hide-away spot for period of ten (10) days. This would take place about four or five months before the election.

(3) First follow-up trip to check on progress of campaign, climaxed by two-day weekend meeting with candidate and his staff. This would be three months before election

(4) Spend final month of campaign on the spot, tying together loose ends and advising on closing phase of campaign

b) Frepare a handbook for election campaigns similar to the one written by Larry O'Brien for Kennedy's campaign. Written in Spanish and specifically tailored for Latin America.

c) Prepare an in-depth study of growing political unrest in Vexico, particularly analyzing the inner workings of PRI. Several recent incidents


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

(Madrazo's forced resignation from PRI; the
run-away riots at the Kational University which
compelled Chavez to resign; the increased number
of *paracaidista* squatters on private lands;
campesino revolte in Northern Mexico) indicate
that the famed political stability of lexico
may be facing trouble soon. Needless to say,
such an ominous possibility should be studied
and analyzed in great depth. No Fexican political
observer would dare produce a truly candid study
for fear of *politicalans* governmental pressure,
but I'm sure I can obtain the *sub-rosa* counsel
and aid of Antonio Fenendez a gifted and per-
ceptive Fexican who wrote NOVILIZACION SOCIAI.
Fenendez, who was a Lopez Fateos speech writer,
is now director of public relations for the
Instituto Nacional de Seguro Social and also
head of the Consejo Nacional de Publicidad.
This long-range project would probably
require about two years, taking into account
my aforementioned political trips.

d) Undertake such other cuasi-political missions
as may be recuired: possible back-up trip to
Santo Domingo; surveys of student unrest in
Spain, Panama, Feru and elsewhere; mid-term
surveys of political situations in Chile, Custe-
mala, Venezuela, etc.

3. Budget Considerations:

a) I would recuire a salary of $20,000 per year, since
I would have to forego any legal practice in order
to be "on tap" and available on almost instant notice.
In these past few years I have lost certain clients
due to my sudden and prolonged absences for special
trips to Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, Santo Domingo,
etc. I would therefore devote all my normal working
time to the activities outlined ink in the foregoing
paragraphs. But I would probably supplement my income
by occasional articles and fiction, written on my
own time.

b) Office rental (if McKenna or X have office available)
would be about $200 per month, with services of a
receptionist included.

c) Costs of telephone: about $240 per year.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

d) Additional costs on Fexico project (paragraph 2 c)

1. fee for Antonio Fenendez, about 32,500 payable in two installments..

2. Two trips to Mexico for consultations with Menendez as work profresses: plane fare would be $256 per trip, plus about $150 expenses for four or five days. Total for two trips would be about $800.

3. Secretarial help, only part-time: about $750 per year, for a total of $1,500.

4. Tape recorder and tapes for two-year period: about $200.

5. Costs of reference books and periodicals: about $150.

Over-all total would be $5,150

e) Costs of preparing election campaign handbook

1. Secretarial costs: about $750

2. Translators' help with special terms for the different latin American countries (they would have to read long lists of words or meet with me personally), about $500.

SECRET

1. TICHBORN, 46, is bilingual and has a wide range of business and social contacts throughout Latin America. Following graduation from Harvard Law School in 1948, TICHBORN became affiliated with a law firm in Los Angeles which represented many Latin American corporations with California business connections. In the mid-1950's he became active in California state politics and served in various capacities in Democratic Party state and national organizations. He participated actively in the California gubernatorial campaign of James Roosevelt, the senatorial campaign of Helen Gahagan Douglas and both the 1952 and 1956 Stevenson campaigns for the Presidency. He has been President of the Southern California Young Democrats, a member of the California Democratic State Central Committee, a member of the Host Committee for the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the Board of Directors of the National Democratic Minority Conference. In 1960 he served as Los Angeles coordinator of the Kennedy Movement for Americans of Mexican Extraction which, it is reported, contributed substantially to the success of the Kennedy campaign in Southern California. His only try for elective office was in 1958 when he was defeated in his bid for the position of California Secretary of State.

2. In late 1959, TICKBORN was hired by the Agency as a political action advisor for Agency sponsored election operations throughout Latin America. In 1961 he became a fulltime contract agent and was assigned to Mexico City, under personal cover, to establish a degree of security and mobility which would permit him to travel readily on third country political action assignments. Since the beginning of his relationship with the Agency, he has participated in Agency sponsored political operations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile and the Dominican Republic. He has just returned from the Dominican Republic where he participated in the Station operations. which contributed to the election of Mr. Belaguer to the Presidency. The Station has described his role in the election operation as "....a vital aspect....at a critical moment in the operation...."; also "....Station knows few, if any, people who could have handled this assignment the way TICHBORN did."

3. TICHBORN has contributed stories, articles and interviews to a variety of United States publications. An interview by TICHBORN of Catherine Anne Porter, Pulitzer prize winner, appeared in a recent edition of Harpers and a TIСНБОНИ essay concerning the cultural dichotomy under which Mexican Americans exist, will appear in an early edition of the American Heritage publication. He is working on a series of articles and a book on the population problem in Latin America and is considering a book on Mexican political institutions, particularly the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI).

4. At present TICHBORN runs a Mexico Station funded left wing intellectual publication (LIREAM). His cover in Mexico is nominal and he attributes his presence and activities primarily to his connections in the legal field through his former partner's law firm and his own intellectual interests.

In Re: Necess of roving from Kexico Ci

1.  For several years my wife, has suffered in varying degrees from the high altitude of Mexico City; but we hać złzys always been hoping she would eventually adjust. On the occasions we went to Acapulco and even Cuernavaca, she has felt much better. But each time she came back to Mexico City she again felt as if her head were stuffed with cotton. This whole business came to crisis-point recently when she went back to Kentucky for a visit while I was in Santo Domingo. While in Lexington she had a long consultation with a family friend who teaches at the Univ. of Kentucky medical school, and he frankly informed her that she was one of those persons who would never adjust to the Fexico City altitude. Knowing that I wish to stay in Mexico (particularly because my son by my ex-wife lives her permanently), she agreed to investigate the possibility of our moving to Cuernavaca - but we have both reached the conclusion that the Cuernavaca has very inadecuate school facilities for our two children, aged 9 ana 11. Moreover, the sanitation situation in Cuernavaca is notoriously bad, and our children have already had difficulties with acoebas here in Mexico City. Thus, reluctantly, I have arcided that we must back to the United States. Aside from her plysical concitiomf, I'm afraid Millie increasing nervous tension will make it impossible for her to stay here.

2. Depending upon their respective appeal to the company, I have been thinking of several projects that would substitute for my work with Dialogos:

a) The preparation of a thorough in-depth study of PRI and Mexican politics, with projections as to the future. I would gather all my materials (interviews, literature, etc.) in a couple of months; then collate and analyze the materials in sore U.S. university, discussing and analyzing same with local political science professors.

b) The preparation of a similar study about the student revolutions now occuring or about to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

break out in various parts of Latin America or Spain.
The recent Univ. of Mexico riots would be my point of departure.

SINCE NEITHER OF THESE STUDIES WOULD TIE ME DOWN TO
A RIGID SCHEDULE, I WOULD BE READILY AVAILABLE THAN
I AM NOW FOR ASSIGNMENTS SUCH AS THE SANTO DOMINGO CAPER.

2. My wife and I are considering two possible sites for our future home:

a) Denver, Colorado, where I attended the public schools and the Univ. of Denver, and thus have long-established connections. Denver's altitude is 2,500 feet less than Mexico City, about the same altitude as Cuernavaca; so Millie could probably adjust to it. I could easily obtain the facilities of the Univ. library for the above-mentioned studies - and several of my friends on the faculty could serve as sounding boards for some of my theories and prophecies in re Mexican politics. My cover there would be easily established.

b) Washington, D.C. (i.e. Virginia or Maryland)
Here I could have benefit of many sounding-boards for the above studies. The "cover" situation for me in Washington would be a bit more ticklish than in Denver - but I could probably come up with a viable one.

Since I do not want to go back to the crabs-in-the-barrel political situation in California (and I could not escape it, were I to move back), we have ruled out returning to that state. In any event, there is no cover I could devise in California to explain long absences for assignments to South America or the Carribean.

> ASSUMING THAT HEADQUARTERS WILL WANT TO DISCUSS THE ABOVE MATTERS
> WITH ME AT GREAT LENGTH AND IN PERSON, I PLAN TO GO TO WASHINGTON
> FROM SANTO DOMINGO ABOUT THE FIRST OF JUNE.

DISPATCH

Chief of Station,

Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SECRET

Reference: 6010320, 14 April 1966

TICHDORN, Income Tax

1. Following is a report of a meeting held with Edward G. of the Tax Committee, Victor D. Utgoff, and of the Support Staff. TICHDORN, Independent Contractor, represented by Contining the Support Staff. On 15 April by a representative Tax Committee; 2. As the Tax Committee was able to settle one entire tax matter of disability locally with TICHDORN. As the Tax Committee was able to settle one entire tax matter of disability locally with TICHDORN. As the Tax Committee was able to settle one entire tax matter of disability locally with TICHDORN.

During the first part of the meeting it was determined TICHBORN had not filed the 1963 tax return with Internal Revenue but had given it to the station support office with a check for the tax owed. The return held by headquarters is a copy of the covert return. Whether an overt return was filed is not clear and TICHBORN was instructed and took action to stop payment on his check for the 1963 taxes. In 1965 TICHBORN account for the check has not been returned or processed to his knowledge but that he had set aside money in a bank for the 1963 and 1964 taxes.

b. It was agreed that the 1963 return on file in Headquarters would be processed as a covered return.

As TICHBORN listed as the son as an exemption, he submitted a certified statement claiming as an exemption, the son by a previous marriage had not been listed on his having provided at least 51% support.

TICHDORN also agreed he would forward a check to Headquarters for the tax due on the return.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

## SECRET

c. As the covert tax return for 1964 was also apparently among the missing documents and as TICHBORN did not have a copy, it was agreed to access beginning with the 1964 tax year and thereafter under the Revised Tax Procedures. The assessments were prepared and reviewed by him and are summarized as follows.

1964--Contract Compensation $13,500.
Tax less Tax Credit 1,450.
Tax Assessment Rate 10.8%

1965--Contract Compensation $15,000.
Tax less Tax Credit 1,790.
Tax Assessment Rate 11.9%

TICHBORN was instructed to forward a check for the 1964 tax less the excess withholding for 1955 plus Social Security tax of $174. for 1964. Social Security tax had been withheld for tax year 1965.

d. The Revised Tax Procedures were explained to TICHBORN and he was advised that a Letter of Instruction regarding the filing of tax returns under the procedures would be forwarded to the Station for his signature. Simply stated, the procedures obviate the filing of covert returns but that a copy of the overt return would be provided Headquarters in a timely manner.

e. STATION ACTION

TICHBORN was advised that a cable would be sent to the Station citing the amount due and he agreed to send the check upon receipt of the cable. He was also advised to make the check payable to some fictitious name of his own selection.

3. TICHBORN showed great signs of relief when he was told that the above actions would settle the subject of his past tax returns and simplify his filing of future returns.

UNITSKY did an excellent job in a minimum amount of time and with no waste of time concerned with any negative aspects of "who struck who or why wasn't something done". TICHBORN was completely cooperative and when the meeting was concluded the sincerity of his thank you to UNITSKY was evident.

4. As a separate matter, TICHBORN asked for more detailed information relating to settlement of a claim for reimbursement of hospital and related expenses which he incurred last year.

STATION ACTION

a. Attached is a copy of the settlement sheet relating to the above claim which is to be made available to TICHBORN.

b. In discussing the matter of payment with Finance they have advised they have not received the T/A requested in DIR 77138 dated 3 Feb 1966.

SUBJECT:
Admin/Income Tax - Request for Direct Assessment of Covert Tax Liability for EDWARD G. TICHBORN

ACTION REQUIRED: Per para 3

REFERENCES:

B. HMMT-6266, dated 14 February 1966

G. HMS-3952, dated 12 January 1965
H. HMMT-5111, dated 17 December 1964

1. Furnished herewith is a request for direct assessment of Covert Tax Liability form, dated 30 March 1966 for Howard G. TICHBORN. The forms were left by Victor D. UNITSKY for completion by TICHBORN, since TICHBORN was not in Mexico City during UNITSKY's visit.

2. The TICHBORN tax case was discussed with UNITSKY who was made aware of the multitude of problems. The series of cable correspondence in regard to the location of TICHBORN'S 1964 Tax returns and check, the final cable of which, Ref A, stated that they could be located in a folder titled "Covert Taxes", was of no avail in locating the missing documents. A thorough search of Station files failed to uncover them.

3. It is hoped that UNITSKY can effect an assessment for 1964 as well as 1965 taxes as a solution to the matter. Also, it would be appreciated if UNITSKY could review the reference concerning the 1963 taxes to ascertain if there is any further action required.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

Ref: A. HMMA 27025, 26 August 1965

B. HMMW 14392, 10 March 1966

1.  Project LICOLIC has been renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 in the amount of $19,000 as requested. This approval was effective 2 March 1966.

2.  As you are aware there has been a good deal of discussion here concerning TICHBORN's operational activities and how he might best contribute to the overall objectives of the Station. It was agreed during EDGEBROOK's visit here (See Ref B) that TICHBORN would be considered henceforth as a full time Station asset and attention would be given to gaining maximum value from his continued presence in Mexico. Within this context, however, it should also be noted that this Project was renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 with the condition that "... prior to the end of the current fiscal year (1966), adequate cover is found to afford TICHBORN not only the needed mobility and safeguards for his work in behalf of the Mexico Station, but also for his possible third country political action assignments...". In addition, the following recommendation was made in the event Project LIREAM should not be renewed (which should not really be considered at present since agreement was

reached to approve Project LIREAM also), "... If this turns out
to be the case we would recommend that TICHBORN be reassigned to
another area (suggest ZRMETAL) under the type of cover (e.g. JETUBA)
which would offer him the needed mobility and protection for area-
wide political action assignments ...". Needless to say, although
the latter point should be kept in mind as a last alternative in
any decision regarding TICHBORN's continued relationship with this
Agency, the Branch believes that the LIREAM publication has im-
proved and has a good chance to gain acceptance and expand its
influence throughout the hemisphere. This being the case, and
as Station plans for expanding TICHBORN's activity within Mexico
take form, we hope his contribution to KUBARK objectives in Mexico
and throughout Latin America will become more substantial and
recognized.

3. As a matter of information, Headquarters would appreciate
   TICHBORN preparing a summary of his present cover situation, par-
   ticularly his appreciation of his present residence and work
   status in Mexico, and his estimate of what the future holds for
   him in this regard. Further, we would appreciate any indication
   the Station may have concerning TICHBORN's personal plans in regard
   to his continued residence in Mexico and his future relationship
   with KUBARK.

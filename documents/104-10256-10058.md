2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

21 August 1974

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Mr. F. I. G. Coleman
C/OPS/LSN

SUBJECT:
FBI Investigation of Allegations
Regarding CIA Activities

1. Reference is made to your memorandum, dated 30 July 1974 and captioned as above, requesting that the names of certain individuals and organizations be searched in Office of Security records and the results of such checks which may be passed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

2. The records of this Office contained no prior information identifiable with Security Defense System; Intelligence Services, Ltd.; or Advance Security Corporation. Our records reflect no prior information identifiable with Howard Gibson of Powder Springs, Georgia.

3. Mitchell Livingston Werbell III, born 8 March 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, served in the Office of Strategic Services briefly from July to December 1945 during World War II, and has repeatedly come to the attention of CIA through the intervening years through his activities, primarily in connection with the Far East and Caribbean areas. He has a reputation as a "wheeler dealer, con-man, arms peddler, and soldier of fortune."

4. The foregoing information may be passed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

5. The following information from Office of Security records was recently passed to Mr. Frank Schwartz, Federal Bureau of Investigation Liaison representative:

"John Patrick Muldoon - Subject was born 25 August 1937 at Washington, D. C. He entered on duty with the Agency on 7 January 1958 as a GS-03 Courier. During his Agency career he became an Operations Officer primarily in the Far, East area. His overseas assignments included (Malaysia) (Bangkok), and (areas of Indonesia).

Leave Without Pay status on 19 November 1971, pending
disability retirement. His retirement became effective
on 19 November 1972, as a GS-12. At the time of retire-
ment he resided at 4305 Kentbury Drive, Bethesda,
Maryland. The latest notation in his file indicated he
may be employed as the Washington representative of the
firm, Security Consultants International."

6. Office of Security records reflect that an individual,
   probably identical to Steve Van Cleave of Atlanta, Georgia,
   had falsely claimed to the State Department in January 1974
   that he worked for CIA in Latin America under cover of Coca
   Cola Company. He also apparently indicated that he is known
   to FBI representatives in Buenos Aires. This information is
   contained in Agency cables DIR-507298, 30 January 1974, and
   DIR-490860, 12 December 1973.

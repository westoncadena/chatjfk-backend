   BELIEVE IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR HIM TO REMAIN MEXICO AND ATTEMPT
   BECOME INVOLVED LOCAL PBRUMEN/GUATEMALA EXILE ACTIVITIES. IF, HOW-

1. STATION WISHES TO REITERATE ONCE MORE ITS RELUCTANCE TO SOMEHOW TRY TO FREE LIRING-3 FROM JAIL IN GUATEMALA CITY BY GOING TO LIAISON AND EXPOSING HIS WOFIRM CONNECTION. MEXICO CITY STATION IN AGREEMENT WITH REF B STATEMENT THAT MORE TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE IF LIRING-3 WILL NOT BE RELEASED IN NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE WITHOUT INDICATING WOFIRM INTEREST. AS STATED IN REF C SUCH INDICATION IF IT LEAKED CAND STATICE ASSUMES THIS POSSIBLE IN GUATEMALAD OR IF IT ATTRACTED SUSPICION GUAT REBELS, MEXICAN LEFTISTS OR PBRUMEKERS WOULD RENDER FURTHER OPERATIONAL EXPOSITATION LIRING-3 AND LIRING-4 PROBLEMATIC. IT MIGHT EVEN PROMPT GUAT REBELS TO TAKE REPRISALS AGAINST LIRING-3 AND LIRING-4. FURTHERMORE STATION NOI AI ALL SURE THAT FREEING LIRING-3 THROUGH INTERVENTION LIAISON MIGHT NOT JEOPARDIZE ROWTON SECURITY.

2. IF LIRING-3 RELEASED AFTER NORMAL TRIAL WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCE STATION ASSUMES BOTH HE AND LIRING-4

Action Required: For your information.

DOC. MICRO. SER.

1. Forwarded under separate cover are twelve reports prepared by Wallace B. ROUTON on the activities of LIRING-3, LIRING-4, and contacts of the latter.

2.  The main topic covered in ROWTON's reports is LIRING-4's efforts to obtain help in getting LIRING-3 out of jail in Guatemala as soon as possible. LIRING-4 is almost penniless (ROWTON has made only token payments to her after 15 June) and has been moving from one apartment to a cheaper one living on the sale of paintings left by LIRING-3 and small loans from leftist contacts. In the hope that she may be able to do something for LIRING-3, LIRING-4 has resisted all of ROUTON's efforts to get her to undertake a clandestine mission to PEZUTEN, a mission, as Headquarters knows, was planned long ago. As a foreigner, LIRING-4 cannot work in Mexico without taking the chance of being deported, if caught. Although she has not tried it, she would probably be refused a visa to go to Guatemala to visit LIRING-3. She might also face difficulties in Guatemala including possible detention and interrogation if she succeeded in obtaining an entry permit to that country.

3. By mid-September 1968 LIRING-4 had received very little help from her Mexican leftist or outright Communist friends. In spite of promises to try to bribe the Guatemalan judge scheduled to try LIRING-3 all LIRING-4's "friends" succeeded in doing was to print several articles in the local press (some of then with LIRING-3's photo) claiming that LIRING-3 was unjustly imprisoned, that he was about to be executed, etc. If anything, these

continued . . . .

articles did little to prejudice the Guatemalans in favor of LIRING-3.
As a matter of fact, the latter who succeeded in sending LIRING-4 a few letters via the Mexican Consul in Guatemala City who comes to visit him in jail, recently claimed that he was saved from a prison "transfer" by the Guatemalan army by the arrival of the Mexican Consul. LIRING-3 viewed this "transfer" purely and simply as an execution attempt.

4. LIRING-4 received even less help from LIRING who told her that there was nothing it could do to help LIRING-3. LIRING-4, on the advice contained in one of the notes sent from prison by LIRING-3, kept away from LIRING and its employees until she met LIRING-10 by accident at the office of one of the leftist papers on 27 July. LIRING-10 convinced her to resume her visits to LIRING. That the local PERUMENS still have doubts about LIRING-3 despite his imprisonment in Guatemala is indicated by the statements made by Rodolfo REYES (see ROWTON'S 17 July report) to the effect that the latter would not be willing to help LIRING-3 until he found out on what side of "el griego" (ROWTON under false identity) he was. REYES added that LIRING suspects the "griego" of WOFIRM connections, although it has no definite proof of this.

5. Statements such as those made by REYES confirm the Station's belief that LIRING, upon orders from home, is still attempting to investigate ROWTON. Such statements also re-enforce the decision of the Station not to attempt, through liaison, to obtain the release of LIRING-3. Such an attempt, if it leaked, would not only expose LIRING-3 to PBRUMEN and Guatemalan FAR reprisals, it would probably also have adverse repercussions on ROWTON's security. LIRING-11 whom ROWTON met briefly on 5 July (see ROWTON's report dated 9 July) said nothing about LIRING-3's arrest when ROWTON complained that mail which he said he sent to LIRING-3 remained unanswered. It is also to be noted that REYES, who of course knows that LIRING-4 is in Mexico, told ROWTON that she was probably in PBRUMEN. This shows clearly the distrust with which LIRING views ROWTON.

CC: GOVM

6. LIRING-4 developed close relationship with Orlando SUAREZ of the Ministry of Culture now in Mexico at the invitation of the Mexican Communist rural painter David ALFARO Siqueiros. By mid-September, in fact, SUAREZ was staying at LIRING-4's apartment although LIRING-4 claimed to ROWTON that there was no romancing between the two and that SUAREZ used her apartment because he was too broke to get one of his own. In view of LIRING-4's assessment of SUAREZ as very leftist and pro-AMTEJG-1 no effort was made to approach him.

7. Contacts between ROWTON and LIRING-4 have taken place with decreasing frequency because the usefulness of LIRING-4 to WOFIRM has sharply decreased and because LIRING-4 is more and more convinced that ROWTON cannot or will not help her obtain the release of LIRING-3. In her frantic efforts to do something for LIRING-3, LIRING-4 has in fact not had any contact with ROWTON since early September. Unless LIRING-3 is released by the Guatemalan authorities or receives only a light sentence keeping him in jail only a short time longer, it is doubtful that LIRING-4 will be of much use to ROWTON and the Station.

1. Forwarded under separate cover are eleven contact reports on the activities of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 for the period 1 April to 10 May 1968 prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON.

2. The main points covered in ROWTON's reports are:

a. LIRING-3's association with Guatemalan rebels in Mexico City, his departure for Guatemala and his arrest and sentencing there;

b. The reaction of friends of LIRING-3's and LIRING contacts to the news of his arrest;

c. LIRING-4's efforts to "case" the offices of the LIRING Consulate, particularly the "safe rooe", and;

d. The obvious provocations of LIRING-4 by Sergio VALDEZ.

3. The product of LIZING-4's efforts to ease the LIRING consulate will be reviewed in a separate dispatch which will also transmit floor plans and drawings of that LIRING component. There is little question that the news of LIRING-3's arrest in Guatemala gained LIRING-4 the sympathy of various members of LIRING including LIRING-3, -9 and -16. They seem to understand LIRING-4's desire to postpone her departure for PBRUMEN after having received her long awaited PBRUMEN visa. The problem now is to have LIEING-4 leave for PBRUKEN while LIRING-3 is still incarcerated in Guatemala. As mentioned in a recent cable, ROWTON has encouraged LIRING-4's plans to try to visit LIRING-3 in jail in Guatemala City as ROWTON feels that LIRING-3 will probably urge LIRING-4 to spend in PBRUMEN at least some of the time he has to spend in jail. As for the conduct of Sergio VALDEZ (see ROWTON's reports dated 19 April and 6 May), it appears that the latter has deliberately been provocating LIRING-4. As this Station sees it, VALDEZ's purpose was to try to "shake up" LIEING-4 in the absence of LIRING-3 to test her reactions. It is doubtful that he acted on his own.

There is no indication that he may have been doing this for the PBRUMEN'S (although this is no doubt a possibility). The Station is looking into the desirability, at this point, of placing VALDEZ under surveillance. The claim that ROWTON in alias offered Carmen LOZADA a certain sum of money for intelligence information in PERUMEN has no foundation.

Subject: Vellisce 2 Aceton Meeting with IRING/4.

1. Rotre set with C/A at the Liara Restaurant (Calle Cississippi) from about 1815 until 1960 c= 15/4/66.1/4 asked caton etter he had heard anything fro/3 and stated that she was bet το sorry since he had promised to let her ac ci az aldress in Chiapas to caich she could write. Eeston pretended zot to koos precisely where and for to long 1/3 エー tended to be away, commenting that he felt it unforturate that he had been out of town three days before 1/3 had left and did not have the benefit of a final discussion. hostor alleged that 1/3 had not told him very such in the letter he had left with 1/4 for him inet وقامت و n fact, cd not rectisced sything about Raúl Foreno diving his ard irancisco Lara to Chiapas in his car. In a farther effort to prezrexits dissuade 1/4 fros believing subsequently (when she finally learned of his arrest) that houten was rescisible for the tragic development, Boston alleged that he had urgei 1/3 not to cross the border bat only to guide Lare to a safe crossing point and return imediately to San Cristóbal.

2. L/4 stated that ucfortunately che herself knea very little of the fical arrangecerts. She explained that 1/3 had told her that he hai persuaded afl horeno to drive biz csi Cera to Chiapas because of the self-inflicted leg wound that prevented Lara from walking any great distance. Ska added that 1/3, in his last telephone conversation with her told her that Raúl Corezo bad finally "chickened out" and returned to Ferice City. (1/4 zace co mention of Carlos Perseval and coton astmes that after all coreno backed cut of his previous commitent, probably even before they left Mexico vity, L/3 turned to Carlos Fersaval and persu-ded his to drive then to Chiapas in his car, and subsequently to accompany thes across the border). L/4 continued that she sas happy that horton had dissuaded 1/3 fra crossiar the border becasue she was well stare of the dangers involved if he fell into a trap or sas picked up by the Guatemalans. She alled that she didnt articularly like Francisco Lara anyway and felt that he was too well known to escape detection.

3. In reply to outca's query, 1/4 stated that Sandoval of the "thirteenth" (Yon Sosa Group) had telephoned her several times to ask if he could help ter in any way, but did not apparently have any cars. caton suggested that 1/4 keep in touch with Sandoval fast incase he sight have learned something frea PAR or Yon Sosa contacts. 1/4 Fave Roston Cardoval's address as cama 54,apt B, bat cozzested that she felt a little encarrassed to see hiz alone in the absence of 1/3. Horton then sugested that perhaps it might be sore discreet

to send 1/3's 16-year-old son (who was staying with her at the time) around to enquire. 2/4 agreed that this would be best and indicated that she would do so the next day. 1/4 also stated that she felt she could get in touch more or less naturally with Raflioresc through Sergio Valdez to determine what had happened during the trip to Chiapas.

4. Howton then asked 1/4 to revisit the LIRING offices the following morning to study the lay-out of the back room (LIRING/3's office) and to use the typewriter again. 1/4 stated that she finally found out that the typewriter in the main office was a German one but had not as yet been able to determine the exact name. She added that the one in the Mexican/Cuban Cultural Relations Office on Calle Hamburgo was a Hericton and not the same as the one in the LIRING office. Howton also asked 1/4 to pick up as many blank forms and letter-head paper as possible.

5. L/4 commented that she had become quite close to Catalina Cepero during the past month and could count on her as a pretext for future visits to the office. 1/4 added that on the previous afternoon Catalina had told her that the salaries of Cubana de aviación personnel had been reduced and that her husband's salary had been cut from 450 dollars per month to 300 and that the LIRING office informed her that gasoline was being rationed for all mission personnel. Catalina also told her that packages destined for Cuba were not being delivered by Cubana de Aviación and that the backlog was so great that two officials had just arrived from Havana to attempt to resolve the problems involved. Catalina also complained that she was "sick and tired" of working in the office without pay and had tried to quit but was told by LIRING/3 that she must continue to help since the workload was so great. L/4 also told Howton that Catalina had complained of money problems because of the cut in her husband's salary and hinted that she could use any money 1/4 could loan her until next payday. Howton suggested that 1/4 lend Catalina 100 or 200 pesos in view of the usefulness Catalina might provide in 1/4's continued access to the LIRING offices. L/4 added that Catalina had apparently become so attached to her that she was urging 1/4 to move into the apartment across the hall from her which had become vacant (Cepero's apartment is 204 at Calle Juanacatlán 169).

6. L/4 also reported that Catalina has told her that a new directive had come out prohibiting all employees of the mission from carrying back to Havana any packages of personal items whatsoever. Catalina commented that for that reason Echoserdia (Suarez de la .az) who left the previous week could not take an [ostraciser] back with him to her family.

Subject: LIAISG/4 Report on Visit to LIRING Offices.

1. Rowton met with LIAI G/4 at the Mississippi Restaurant from about 2035 until 2115 on 17/4/53 to rebrief her on her visit to the LIRING office earlier that day. LIAISG/4 was obviously worried, and said so at one point, about LIRING/3 in view of the total absence of any news or communication from him. Rowton pretended to be even more ignorant of L/3's current whereabouts than L/4 herself, and asked anxiously whether she had learned anything from Sandoval or Sergio Valdez. L/4 replied that Sergio had told her that Raúl Moreno while driving L/3 and Lara to Chiapas had had an accident in the car that had proved very costly to him, although fortunately no injuries resulted to anyone. Valdez continued that Raúl had to appeal to his father for money to cover the expenses involved in getting the car running again. Valdez did not know what happened to L/3 and Lara after Raúl Moreno left them (apparently enroute to Chiapas) and could not provide any further information.

2. As to Sandoval, L/4 told Rowton that the latter had again telephoned her to offer any help she might need but did not have any news from Lara or L/3. L/4 gave Rowton the home address of Francisco Lara as care of Martha I. Lara de Rodriguez, 16 Avenida 20-74, Zona 12, Guatemala, Guatemala, tel: 46-17-17.

3. L/4 then reported that she had visited LIRING/9's office as requested by Rowton and managed to get another look at the book-case cabinet in the corner of the room. She commented that on entering the premises she was surprised to find that the typewriter (German make) previously located in the middle office (that used by Mirabal) had been moved into the back office of L/9 and that Rosita, the wife of Luna, was struggling with two fingers to type out something as she entered. L/4 said that L/9 was quite cordial to her and invited her in for a coffee and presenting her with five tickets to the ballet performance that evening. When L/4 asked him whether anything had come in re her re-entry permit, the latter immediately began opening the mail on his desk with the comment that perhaps a reply had arrived that morning and he would check at once. After looking through the mail he replied in the negative but did not discourage L/4 from hoping that the reply would be in soon.

4. L/4 then stated to Rowton that she noticed that the cabinet in the corner of the room was bigger than and lower than she had recalled from previous visits and had legs about two inches high. She added that the cabinet which was divided into two sections, the one to the left containing a shelf on which there was nothing but cigars and cigarettes and the right/consisting of a compartment with a door covered with sack cloth (costal) and possibly locked by key.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

2. 
She stated that the cabinet was placed catty-cornered and that in the rather spaciousix triangle behind it she could see many relis of paper, which she assumed were discarded posters apparently placed there at random. L/4 then made the attached sketch on a napkin stressing the difficulty she had in pro- viding to/ton with exact measurerents. She added that there were two windows facing the street, one in the reception room and one in the middle room, cut the only window in the back roon faced on the inside patio and had a verettan blind and a gauze curtain but no drape.

5. 1/4 shen told towton that she had learned f on Jorrin that he would be re- turning PCS very soon since his replacement had already arrived. He gave L/4 his home address as Velasquez 94 Altos, e/Infanta y Cruz del Padre, Barric Villa Hueva, Hahone, was suc Boula take advantage of his return (possibly on 22/4/63) to send another letter to Abreu asking for a definitive reply to her re-entry request. She added that she felt she could count on Jorrin for this service, she her relations with him had always been very cordial.

6. L/4 also mentioned that she had seen and grested Cepeda who had just re- turned from Havana (apparently without his wife). 2/9 told L/4 that he bel had been in Havana the preceding seek on a regular courior run.

7. L/4 also turned over to Rowton several publications which she had received from Catalina Cepero and the press office. She commented that the wife of Crus vas working es secretary to the Chief LIRING in addition to her duties as res ponsible for confidential cocuments.

19 April, 1968

Subject: LIRING/4 Report of Conversation with Sergio Valdez re
LIRING/3 Alleged COFACT Affiliation.

1.  LIRING/4 met with Routon at the new safehouse room Routon rented for security reasons under the alias Jean Fercier at the Suites Farne. Routon had given 1/4 a key and she entered the building and proceeded directly to the apartment, arriving at about 1700. Routon posed as a French businessman and introduced L/4 to the owwer(and his sister) as his secretary.

2.  LIRING/4 stated that she was glad to have some tire alone with koston since she had received a disturbing report from Sergio Valdez again revealing that reports of TATA/2's alleged affiliation with KOFACT were circulating in leftist circles. She explained that Sergio Valdez had talked with her at her apartment (Atovac) Monday evening (15 April, 1958) far into the night about two reports he had received about LIRING/3. Sergio Valdez explained that about three weeks previously his father (who works on the staff of "Siempre") told him that he should be careful in his dealings with LIRING/3 since the latter was a KOFACT agent. Sergio Valdez told L/4 that he bacame indignant at this telling his father that he had known 1/3 for the past ten years and considered L/3 as his mentor in revolutionary philosophy and had absolutely no reasons to distrust him in his current activities. Sergio Valdez added that he threatened to break with his father unless the latter revealed to him the source of his information. His father finally confessed that he learned this from Alberto Coringuez, his boss in Siempre, but he could not say from whom Dominguez had received the report.

3.  Sergio Valdez continued that in addition to this report he had also been told soze time ago by General Heriberto Jara (now deceased) that he should be careful in his dealings with LIRING/3 since the latter was known to be a "traitor to the revolution". Sergio Valdez added that General Jara did not speccify azy reason for his allegation or give details.

4.  Sergio Valdez, according to 1/4, stated in reference to these allegations that he was quite naturally very disturbed and had hesitated to mention them to LIRING/3 before his departure in order not to upset him. He stated that he had given the matter a great deal of thought and had come to the conclusion that Crozco was the person passing out this scurrilous report and that he intended to get to the bottom of the whole business himself without involving LIRING/3.. He explained that he was planning to organize a group of four or five armed men to kidnap Orozco and interrogate him until he confessed everything. He added that if Crozco finally confessed that he had passed this

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

2. 
calumny to Alberto Dominguez they would assassinate Orozco on the spot. If, however, it became clear that Crozco was innocent they would look for some one else who might have been the source.

5. LILING/4 stated that this whole conversation had shaken her badly since it was again an indication that 1/3 was through no fault of his own accused of betraying the revolution and she was well aware of the drastic action that the Guatemalan revolutionaries as well as the Cubans were willing to take again persons accused even on sliz evilence of being traitors. She asked Aorton under no circumstances to reveal this latest report to LIMING/3 since she knew such reports might drive his to do something drastic.

6. II 1G/4 also reported that in the course of conversation Sergio Valdez mentioned report against 1/3. She explained that Sergio Valdez said that he knew of 1/3's business relations with Harris in the past and that he himself hoped some day to be able to meet Harris so that he might interest Harris in his own commercial ventures. 1/4 told Aorton that she pretended not to have much direct dealing with Harris and alleged that as far as she knew he was currently in Canada.

Subject: Rolando Mendez Aguilar, Guatemalan Rebel Contact in Mexico City.

1. LILAP coverage of the home telephone of LIWING/3 has revealed Subject to be a contact of Francisco Lara of FAR and Rodolfo Sandoval of the Yon Sosa group of Guatemalan rebels in Mexico City.

2. On two occasions in early April, 1962, Francisco Lara, during a visit to LIKING/3's apartment, made telephone calls to 45-60-30 (listed as Publicaciones e Impresiones Mexicanas S.A. - Diario Ovaciones, Calle Lago Simahuan 207 ) and asked for S. Mendez Aguilar on extension 27. It is apparent from the context of conversation that Subject is a close friend and possible collaborator of FAR's. LIWING/3 reported the telephone call to Horton, which he stated was made in his presence in an effort by Lara to locate Rodolfo Sandoval. According to 1/3, Lara asked the person whom he telephoned (L/3 could not identify this person since Lara did not use his name while talking) where "their fine friend" was. L/3 continued that Lara did not mention Sandoval's name, apparently for security reasons, but he had previously told L/3 that he was calling to determine the whereabouts of Sandoval. L/3 also reported that he heard Lara refer to a certain "El Gato" and to "El Gordo". L/3 told Horton that he could not identify the former, but it appeared that "El Gordo" referred to the young friend of Lara's whose photograph L/3 had previously given to Horton for copy-ing and who was named only "Roberto" in conversations with Lara.

3. The LIFLIT intercept reveals that Francisco Lara told Mendez Aguilar that he had been with Sandoval early the preceding evening but that the latter had not shown up for the meeting arranged for that same morning. When pressed Mendez confessed that Sandoval had returned home drunk and was probably sleeping off the effects of the previous evening. This would indicate that Sandoval probably lived with Mendez Aguilar, or at least maintains close contact with him.

4. The Station is attempting to determine the home address of Subject in the hope that further specific information can be uncovered concerning his relationship with FAR.

24 April,1968

1.  LIRING/4 informed Rowton 24 April, 1968, that she received telegram from Mexican Consulate Guatemala City advising her "Consulate inter-vening in case her husband; will continue to keep informed". LIRING/4 on her own initiative (before she able meet with Rowton) asked advice Sergio Valdez and Manuel Marcué Jardiñas (of defunct Politica).

2.  On recommendation Valdez, LIRING/4 telephoned Mexican Consulate Guate-mala City and spoke at some length with Consul Octavio Serrano. Latter assured her LIRING/3 well and that he taking personal interest since he personal friend Liain/3's father. He explained that initial hearing would take place next day and that judge would have eight days in which decide disposition of the case. He gave LIRING/3 his home telephone and promised to keep her informed.

3.  No mention made either in conversation with Serrano or in local press of simultaneous arrest of Francisco Lara, although arrest of Carlos Persabal Marcué Kenk reported simultaneous. Charge listed as "distributing communist propaganda".

4.  LIRING/4 also reported that in her hurried meeting with Manuel Marcué Pardiñas latter at first took "it-served-them-right-approach" but confided that he had learned of arrest preceding day and immediately appealed to Carrillo Flores. According Marcué, Flores sent telegram in his presence to Bexican Consulate instructing it to bring matter to diplomatic level if necessary.

5.  LIRING/4 also showed Rowton note from LIRING/3 in pencil on brown paper apparently/itom paper bag which she stated she received that day in plain envelope with typed address and apparently notional return address. She assumes this sent at request LIRING/3 by Octavio Serrano. Note reassure LIRING/4 that LIRING/3 in good health and that he can handle matters on his own. He states "Persabal is to blame" and instructs LIRING/4 to warn wife of Francisco Lara not to talk to anyone. Also to urge mother of Lara not to come Guatemala City in attempt help him.

6.  Rowton instructed LIRING/4 give maximum play this development to LIRINGS in hope that this might wipe out adverse reports circulating against loyalty LIRING/3. LIRING/4, who expects re-entry permit PBRUMEN comentarily, will ask LIRINGs for extension in view developments.

25 April, 1966

Subject: LILNG/4 Report of Visit to LILNG Offices.

1. LILNG/4 reported to London at 1600 on 25/4/66 at the hotel saferoom that she had visited the LILNG establishment that morning to inform every- one of the news concerning FIRENC/3. She stated that on entering her friend (LILNG/9's secretary), informed her that her re-entry permit had come through the preceding evening. L/A explained at once that unfort ately she could not leave on the next flight becasus of LILNG/3's arrest. Che then, despite the fact that his secretary told her that LILNG/9 ves in a nasty mood, went into the latter's office and told him what had happened. LIRING/9 was very sympathetic, tellin her that he also read the article in the paper. Her "L" showed him the aedy note wriccen to her by L/9 which contained the sentence "Persabal tiene la culpa", LILNG/9 became very agitated and exclaimed that he would immediately "take out a card" (ficha) recording this treachery of Persabal. L/9 agreed that L/A could not possibly leave for 30 as planned and felt it would not be difficult to get an extension over the usual twenty-day limit of the re-entry permit.

2. LIING/4 continued that she then went to see LIING/2 and recounted the whole story to him, including L/3's involvement wich FAR and the 13th of November zovezent. She noted that when she casually es ented that acdolfo Sandoval had told her that Yon Tosa had returned from via Mexico City about a month previously, LILNG/2 pretended not to be aware of this, exclaiming, "Imagine, they don't tell us those things!" LILER/? then said that he was leaving for a week 20 in 3382 the next day and could be happy to take slong any letters L/4 might wish to send to their mutual friends explaining why she could not leave for at that time.

3. LIRING/4 also reported that while she was in the office of LILNG/9 she met leo Deven who runs a hotel in Acatulco and whom she remembered from occasional visits her made to the LILNG offices while she was working there She described Deven as an obvious homosexual, well dressed and patronizing in his manners. He told her that he planned to travel to Panama on "Fri- day" (whether 25 April or 3 May was not specified) to see his son who was studying there. L/4 commented that everyone at the LILNG office appeared to treat Deven with respect and confidence.".

4. Re the layout of the office of LILNG/9 (backroom) LIING/4 said she noted the addition of the typewriter table (formerly in the middle room)against the left wall with a portable Clympia typewriter on it. The German typewriter was still the big desk. Also behind the small coffee table in the corner she noted that the rolled up posters were gone and in their place were two or three packages of books.

Subject: LIRING/4 Report of Meeting with Manuel Marcué Pardiñas.

1.  Roston met with IRING/4 for lunch at the Punto Blanco restaurant on Melchor Ccampo at 130C on 27/4/68. Roston had given up the safe- room in the Eotel Suites Harne earlier that corning since he felt it was not longer necessary.

2.  LIZING/4 reported that Manuel Marcué Fadiñas, the uncle of Carlos Fersabal Marcué, had telephoned her the previous evening "freathe street" and arranged to see her privately at the Koala Restaurant (Honda Tashale notel) later in the evening. According to LIRING/4, Parcué told her that through his appeal to Carrillo Flores the case of LIAIG/3 and his nephew was nowin diplomatic channels and he hoped that both prischers sould be simply deported after a summary trial. He could not, however, guarantee anything, especially the length of time involved, and asked: LinG/4 to re- frain from any activity that might prejudice the case. Specifically he instructed LI1/4 to break off all contact with the Guatemalan revolu- tionaries in Mexico, the LIRING establishment, and all communication with the Mexican Consul in Guatemala City. He sexzake stressed that any false Love on LING/4's part might cause Carrillo Flores to withdraw is inter- vention. Farcué promised to keep in touch with IBING/4 so that she would not feel completely helpless. He added that the mother of Carlos Fersabal Farcué (supposedly Manuel Harcué Fardiñas' sister) would be traveling toc Guatemala City in the next few days so that she could visit her son and follow the case at first hand.

3. LIRING/4 also reported to howton that Rodolfo Sandoval of the Im Sosa group had procised to visit her at her apartment the previous evening at 2200 in the company of Sergio Valdez to discuss matters further. H ad in- forced her on the phone in making the date that "El Gordo" had returned from Guatemala City - implying that the latter had news concerting the fate of Francisco Lara (whose arrest was not reported in the press, nor by tavio Serrrano, the Mexican Consul, to LIING/4). LIRING/4 surmised that Francisco Hara had escaped arrest and his involvement with ING/3 was not known. she therefore agreed with Harcus that she should not see Sandoval and the other Guatemalans in public, and especially not at her apartaent.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 61

2. 
4. LIRING/4 also reported that Manuel Marcué Pardiñas had asked her not to call him at his home again to ask for news, or as a matter of fact discuss in any way the case by telephone. He stated that he felt the phone of LIRING/4 as well as his own phones were tapped and that possibly LIRING/4's apartment was being watched. He did not specify by whose or for what purpose, but LIRING/4 told Rowton that she assumed it would be either by the Mexican Government or the Mano Blanca of Guatemala or both. Rowton again encouraged LIRING/4 to move out of the Atoyac apartment and back into the less conspicuous calzada Tacubaya place, commenting that this would not only prevent future security risks but also convince the LIRINGs that she was suffering financially because of LIRING/3's plight (she stated that she has already intimated this inconversations with the wife and secretary of the LIRING Chief, as well as with LIRING/2). LIRING/4 agreed but expressed regret that the Tacubaya apartment did not have a phone and that she might miss important mail addressed to the Atoyac apartment and arriving after her departure. Rowton suggested one last letter to the Mexican Consul in Guatemala City simply advising him of the change of address.

5. LIRING/4 also showed Rowton the return address typed on the envelope in which the note from LIRING/3 to her had been forwarded. The address, which Rowton supposes is notional, placed on the envelope by Otavio Serrano for security reasons, is as follows:

Carlos Rodriguez
35 Avenida 20-67, Zona 5
Guatemala C.A.

6. Rowton concluded with the comment that he felt LIRING/4 need not take Marcué's instruction not to visit the LIRING offices too seriously, since it was a well known and easily ascertainable fact that LIRING/4 had a logical reason for going there occasionally. Rowton did not wish LIRING/4 to break off relations at this critical time, expecially since LIRING/2 had commented to her on her last visit that she should feel free to come in at any time she needed help or consolation during the crisis.

SUBJECT: LIRING/4 Report of Contact with Sandoval and Farcué.

1. Howton met with LI ING/4 for late lunch at the Junto Blanco restaurant on Kelchor (campo on 29/4/63. She had to bring her child along since the 16-year-old son of LIRING/3 was not at her apartment at the tide.

2. LIRING/4 reported that Sandoval of the 13th of November Group of Ion Sosa had again visited her and shoen great concern for her welfare. He again offerfed her some zoney, such as he had, but LIAING/4 refused in vies of his simultaneous complaints of the financial crisis he himself was undergoing. He explained that since Francisco Lara left he had teen supporting Lara's entire fazily consistics of lara's wife, mother, and their two young children. LIRING/4 said Sandoval reached a point in enotional frustration during the conversation that he exclaimed that he would have to resort to robbery or a hold-up in order to get the necessary money not caly to support Lara's family but to send sczeone to Guatezala City to see LIRING/3 and procure a good lawyer for him. LIAISG/4 told "oston that this upset her so that she spent the rest of the evening pleading with Sandoval not to commit any criminal act. Sandoval then revealed that he and his friends had held up a policeman during the Eumphrey visit and taken his gun, since they were short one weapon.

3. LIRING/4, ccamenting that Sandoval's only income was from selling language records for the Cortina Instituto Linguistico, told äowtor that she prorised to contact all her friends in an attempt to help him sell the records and thus raise some money legally. L/4 explained to doston that Sandoval's commission is about 350 pesos per set of records, which is actually the down payment made by the customer (the remainder being paid in weekly or conthly instalments of about 165 pesos). L/4 asked poston's telp in finding customers acong his business contacts to help Sandoval.

4. LIANG/4 also reported that Haruel Marcué Pardiñas had visited her at her apartment late the previous evening. He told her that Carlos Fersabal's wife, Teresa lozada, would be accompanying her mother-in-law to Guatemala City. He also stated that he was optimistic since Carrillo Flores had instructed the Fexican Consul to appeal to the Guatemalan Minister of Foreign Affairs. Harcué commented that unfortunately the Mexican Consul could not reach this official himself since he was currently in New York. Ee hoped however that the Consul would see the Minister's secretary tdarrange direct intervention. L/4 commented to Roston that Marcus seemed very curious about

the LIEING office, but she fenced off his questions by alleging that she had little or no contact with it. 1/4 also comzented that Sergio Valdez, who was being particularly helpful to her at this time, warned her sternly against accepting any money from Marcué in light of his re- putation as an unscupulous Lothario. 1/4 added that Earcué promised to see her again the following evening to keep her informed.

5. hen coxwton again suggested that LIG/4 nove from the Atoyac part- went back to the Facubaya place despite its dreariness and lack of tele- phone, she presented zo objection, commenting that with all the traffic in and out of her atcayac apartment at all hours of the night her reputa- tion is proebly in jeopardy, especially with her iscijale neighbors and the cleaning women and zaids. She promised Porten to move out the following way since it as the end of the month and a logical time. She also promised when revisiting the LIRIG office the next morning to make this known, stres- sing her financial plight.

6.KING/4 then appealed to orton to help her establish some sort of contact with LIETIG/3, if for nothing eise than to find out how he was and whether he needed anything. L/4 felt that souten might send some business contact of his to visit 1/3 on Sorton's behalf, giving some recognition signal to LIENG/3. When Rostca pointed out the danger in this of possibly making things worse for L/3, LISING/4 consented that Sandoval had told her that visitors were not required to sign a register or give lengthy explana- tions. L/4 added that she might find someone, including Sergio Valdez cr Raúl Moreno or one of their friends who might make a short trip to Guatena- la City to see LIRING/3. In reply to Roston's query, 1/4 commented that she did not expect anything from the wife or mother of Carlos iersabal since they had not even bothered to telephone her since the arrest became known.

7. Koston rozised to give the matter some thought and discuss it further with LIBING/4 the following afternoon.

Subject: LIRING/4 Report of Contacts with LIKING Office.

1. On 3 May, 1956, LIRC. G/4 reported to Boston that she had revisited the LIRING offices the preceding day and noticed that the black telephone was replaced in the riddle office ( where she herself used to work). She stated that she could not be certain that it was the same instrument and that it was replaced by one of the LIRILG employees, but it appeared that way since she had act seen the instrument there on ter visit on the previous Friday (26/4/63) and LIIG/9 had commented that the telephone would be replaced in th

2. ith regard to LIRING/3's current situation, LLC/4 reported that she had again talked to the lexican Consul in Guatemala City by telephone on 2 Hay, 1966, and was reassured that LILING/3 was in good health. The Consul informed her that he could visit 1/3 on Thursdays and Sundays, and would be glad to pass any letters that 1/4 sigt send to hiu for L/3. The Consul also commented that the Hexican keleciones Exteriores had instructed hiz to take up L/3's case with the Guatemalan Kiaistry of Foreign Affairs. He added that he hoped with this pressure to persuade the Guate-zalan government to deport 1/3 within the next ten days.

3. LIBING/4 then reported what she described as a very disturbing conversation on 3 May, 1968, with Sergio Valdez. She related that Valdez had coze to see her in the morning to apologize for not having any money to lend her to help her meet expenses. Ee explained that he had not been paid by the RevistaiForque? and was very short of funds himself. L/4 continued that she would have to appeal to all her friends and those of 1/3 for some Goney to tide ter over until 1/3 returned. She then regretted that she had rct been able to locate "Sr. Harris" but if and when he came to Mexico again she would have to "renew diplomatic relations"with his. Sergio Valdez the according to LIKING/4, laughed and said that this feminded him of another nasty razor that he had beard. Es then revealed that Baul Koreno hed recently teid hin that a certain Gonzalez of the Spartaco Club had told him (Koreno) that HIKING/4 had been fired frca the IRING offices because she had been providing information to the F3.3-NC Entassy and that he had learned this from the LIRING "service" officer. Sergio Valdez also mentioed that a "girl who worked in the zona rosa" who nows Teresa cr Carmen Lozada had mentioned that Sr. Harris had offerted Caraen Lozada the sum

of 34,000.00 for information on the situation in PBROMEN. LISIG/4
told Boston that she was badly shaken by these comments but attempted
to assume as non-chalant an air as possible and did not question Sergio
Valdez to determine the exact source. Che noted that Cergio Valdez hal
mentioned koston several times to her, always apparently in passing, with
the obvious hope that CIRING/4 would reveal his presence in Mexico and
arrange an introduction to him for sergio Valdez. CIRING/4 agrced wita
howton that Valdez was probably provoking her since at all times her ap-
peared to be well cisposed toward Sr. Earris from what he ones of his from
LIAING/3. Howton commented to L/4 that the last report concerning Carmen
Lozada appeared to have been fabricated either by Sergio Valdez or one of
his friends, simply on the basis of the fact that Sr. Harris had been in
touch the citite sue mas in mexico.

4. LIRC/4 then stated that she felt she had to continue to ispress Sergio
   Valdez with her desperate need for money and accordingly telephoned-the
   LIRING gatekeeper in his presence and asked for a loan. Then the gatekeeper
   responãed favorably, she left Sergio Valdez waiting in the apartment and
   went to the LIRING Offices at once to collect the ican. The gatekeeper gave
   her 100 pesos on the spot, fortunately in the presence of LIRIEG/13. 1/4
   told Roxton that she promised to return the money in the next week, as soon
   as she received money promised to her by her father.

5. LIXING/4 added that as she was leaving the IIAING office she ran into
   the leftist writer, Jaime Labastida, who expressed his sorrow at the arrest
   of LIENG/3. Labastida commented that screcne had told his recently that
   a cartoon of some kind had appeared in a Tapachula Levspaper "against II-
   RING/3". When 1/4 pressed him he gave a description of the "someone" that
   definitely identified hin as Sergi: Valiez. L/4 continued that when she
   confrcated Sergio Valdex with this upon her return to the apartment, he
   hotly denied it, cuch to L/4's mystification.

6. LIKING/4 also commented that Manuel Farçue Pardiñas continued to tele-
   phone her at very late hours of the right in the hope (she assumed) that
   she would invite him up. She called hin a "viejo verde" and added that she
   had no intention of seeing him alone at her hore at night.

8 May, 1968

Subject: LINING/4 Report Concerning Sentencing of LIBIG/3.

1. LIANG/4 reported to howton at the Pusto Blanco restaurant on Felecor
   Ocampo at 1300 on 5/5/68 that Manuel Harcué Fardiñas had infcrued her at
   0100- that same day that he had just learned that IG/3 and his nepcew
   bad been sentencel to prison, with a cirisun term of six months. Marché
   added that his sister and her daughter-in-law z uld be returning to fexico
   City by the end of the week and should be able to supply details of the
   trial and prospects for the immediate future of heving the prison tera re-
   duced. LIRING/4 ex:lained to Routor that she had accepted a dinner invi-
   tation at Sanborns extended to her by Aguirre Jeries. almost

: Hau stuchea at the University of liavera, and arrived at the
home of Gilberto and Blanca Amant (Blanca Peña de Arant), with wich she was
staying, rather late cad found Hanuel Marcué waiting for her. After a
logizing profusingly for his previous rude conduct with. L/4, be reported
the latest news cc.cercing 1/3 to her.

2. LIENG/4 agreed with oston that although the prison sentence was pro-
   bably definite, she should check it out with the Mexican Conmal personally.
   She stated that fortustely she remembered a certain Josefina Rodriguez who
   worked in the larça distancia service of Telefonos de México whom she had
   originally met as a friend of LIKING/2. 1/4 commented that Srta Rodriguez
   whom she described as *Tuy fea* was enamored of LIRING/2: some years ago but
   stopped seeing him (to her knowledge) when she found out that he was married.
   1/4 continued that Srta nodriguez had already promised to put through lang
   distance calls to Guatemala for 1/4 sithout charging the calls, if they could
   be arranged during her shift at the switchboard.

3. LIRING/4 also recorted that she had azein visited the LIRING offices at
   1345 on 7/5/63 and again about 1130 that same morning. At Rowton's request
   she gain checked the phone in the third office. On the first visit the of-
   fice had already been closed but she ran into LIRI.G/13 at the gate and ac-
   cepted a ride home (she felt this fortunate since he dropped her at the
   Tacubaya apartment at her request). On this occasion during a brief exchang
   of comments with the gatekeeper and L/13, ISI.G/4 learned that LIG/2
   will return from BRUKEN on 10/5/68. CS COPY

4. On visiting the LIRING Offices on the morning of 8/5/68, LIRING/4 told
   Porten that fortunately only her fttend Catalina and hosita (secretary
   of LINING/9) were present. then she went into the third office where zosita
   was working she asked to use the phone and approached the instrument. Che

was able to note that the name "Cki Electric, Tokyo, Japan" was marked on the instrument. She also rated the word "Gall" but could not tell whether it was part of the manufacturer's size or a Mexican or U.C. subsidiary. She also noted that below the receiver were four switches (like the ordinary push light switches) unmarked or unnumbered. Then she exclaimed to Rosita: "How do you dial on this phone", Rosita replied: "But it's not a phone, it's an intercom". LIRING/4 told Rowton that she then commented: "But now come, the intercom is in the first office." Rosita then, according to L/4, stated: "But that's a special intercom." (L/4 explained that she was referring to the phone she had in her hand).

5. LIREI: 3/4 continued that when she passed through the second office, she noted that the phone which had been replaced in that room was of Ericsson manufacture and was the same instrument previously there when she worked in that office. She assumes that the LIRINGS replaced the phone themselves.

6. LIRING/4 also told Rowton that she had located an excellent apartment in the Mifico Condesa (Matzatlán and Veracruz) through her friend Blanca Peña who lives in the same development. LIRING/4 added that she had given the administrator 300 pesos to hold the apartment for her until she could arrange a fiador. She also stated that she could obtain a telephone eventually since the former tenant had applied and received approval just before he left. LIRING/4 reassured Rowton that she was telling everyone, particularly the LIRINGS, that she was living at the Tacubaya apartment and temporarily staying as a house guest at the home of Blanca Peña de Azant. She also reassured Rowton that she had informed the LIRING gatekeeper when she returned the 100 peso loan that she had received money from her father in New York. LIRING/4 added that several friends, including the well-known writer Revueltas, had offered to find her some sort of work. She stated that if she could find suitable employment in the mornings she would accept the offer, if only for appearances.

2. According to reports submitted to Wallace B. ROUTON by
   LIRING-3, the latter set Carlos Manuel Persaval Varcue originally
   through the latter's sister-in-law, Carmer Lozada de Ramirez,
   who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair with LIRING-3
   since early November 1967. On the evening of 3 March 1968,
   Persaval approached LIRING-3 in connection with the difficulties
   that a young Guatemalan woman living in Mexico City vas having
   in obtaining false documentation to enable her to travel to
   Guatemala to recontact her husband, whom Persaval described as
   "an important guerrilla leader". Persaval revealed to LIRING-3
   that he had been assisting the FAR in propaganda work in Hexico
   for some time and gave LIRING-3 several copies of a pamphlet
   entitled "Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had bee'n
   published on one of his uncle's presses and was being sold at the
   nominal price of three Mexican pesos to help raise money for the
   FAR.

3. When LIRING-3. under ROWTON's direction, responded
   favorably to this initial approh, Persaval pursued the matter
   and finally, on 8 April, revealed that he was in touch with two
   "パー
   who needed neip in returning
   clandestinely to Guatemala. Persaval asked LIRING-3 to arrange
   to guide these persons across the Guatemalan border south of
   Chiapas, an area LIRING-3 had previously told Persaval he was very
   faniliar with from his previous residence in San Cristobal.
   Persaval made no further reference to the "young Guatemalan wife
   of the FAR leader". LIRING-3 surmised to ROWTON that this person
   might actually have been the wife of Francisco Lara Barrios, but
   that plans for her return were discarded in favor of the trip
   by Lara himself.

4. At ROWTON's urging, LIRING-3 insisted on meeting the two
   Guatemalans involved and in talking to then before undertaking
   such a mission. Persaval finally introduced LIRING-3 to Francisco
   Lara Barrios on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIRING-3
   to a certain "Rodolfo", who LIRING-3 ascertained subsequently was
   a member of the 13th of November group headed by Yon Sosa by the
   name ofxSandoval. Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIRING-3
   that he had in his possession a false Guatemalan passport in the
   name of Jose Maria Oliva Carranza and that he had obtained legal
   residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts
   of ex-Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas. He also named a certain
   y Eskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons who assisted Guatemalan exiles
   in Mexico. Station believes Eskenazi may be identical vith
   Luis David Eskenassy Cruz, a former agent of the Guatemala City
   Station.

5. With the approval of ROWTON, LIRING-3 agreed to help
   the above-mentioned persons to cross the Mexican/Guatemalan border
   and to accompany them to Guatemala City. This latter extension of
   the original trip was made by Lara at the suggestion of LIRING-3
   so that the latter could meet with the FAR woman responsible for
   logistics. LIRING-3 reported to ROWTON subwequently that just
   before their departure, Lara also offered to arrange for LIRING-3
   to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to meet directly
   with FAR and 13th of November leaders to discuss further support
   that LIRING-3 might be able to provide through his commercial
   contacts in Chiapas and northern Mexico.

6. LIRING-3 fabricated a false Mexican identity document
   (Secretaria de Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the
   name of Jacinto Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disguised so
   that the latter could move about more unobtrusively on the Mexican
   side of the border just prior to crossing. On 3 April 1958,
   just prior to their scheduled departure date, Francisco Lara

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

## SECRET HYMA - 34531

informed LIRING-3 that their mutual friend Rodolfo Sandoval would not be accompanying them since he was too well known and his mission was not important enough to justify the risk and the expense involved.

7. LIRING-3 did not depart as he had hoped on 5 April 1968, because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle on the morning of that day while cleaning his gun and had to be given medical attention before he could make the trip. LIRING-4 told ROWTON that LIRING-3, Francisco Lara and Raul Moreno, a friend of LIRING-3, finally left Mexico City in the personal car of Raul Moreno on 10 April 1968. but that Moreno had returned to Mexico City two days later as a result of an accident that disabled the car somewhere in Chiapas. LIRING-4 did not report anything concerning the subsequent involvement of Carlos Persaval Marcue, stating that she had not received any communication from LIRING-3 after his telegram of 12 April, in which he reported the return of Raul Moreno. ROWTON surmises that when Raul Moreno had to return to Mexico City, LIRING-3 and Lara asked Carlos Persaval Marcue to join them and drive them to the border and that Persaval continued on with them toward Guatemala City.

8. Guatemala City Station advised on 22 April 1968, that the story of the arrest of Lara, Persaval and LIZING-3 had reached the local press and that they would be turned over to the appropriate courts for trial. This indicates that LIRING-3 may eventually be released and hence be available to ROWTON for complete debriefing.

9. The only significant name that had surfaced as a result of LIRING-3's involvement with the Guatemalan rebels in Mexico City is that of Rolando/Mendez Aguilar, whom Francisco Lara Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27, in early April from the home telephone of LIRING-3. (This number corresponds to the "Publicaciones e Impresiones Mexicanas, S.A. - Diario Ovaciones, Calle Lago Sirahuen 297, Mexico City). From the LIFEAT coverage on LIRING-3 it is apparent that Mendez is a close contact of both Lara and Sandoval and may be providing or have provided employment for them in Mexico. The Station is attempting to determine the home address of Mendez in the hope that further details of his possible collaboration may be uncovered.

1.  On 5 March 1968, LIRING-3 had dinner with CARLOS
    PERSAVAL MARCUE, nephew of HANUEL MARCUE PARDINES, director
    of the now defunct magazine "POLITICA", a Communist bi-
    monthly publication. During the dinner PERSAVAL queried
    LIRING-3 if he could obtain a false passport for the wife
    of an important Guatemalan guerilla leader so that she
    could traci sive Scaico Lo uratemia. LIRING-3 replied
    that he would do his utmost to assist.

2.  On 8 March 1968 PERSAVAL told LIRING-3 that two(2)
    Guatemalan revolutionaries had need to travel to Guatemala
    by mid-March. LIRING-3 commented that there was limited
    possibility of obtaining false documents, but that he could
    brief the Guatemalans so as to facilitate their illegal
    crossing of the Mexican/Guatemalan border, or if they desired,
    he would guide them.

3.  On 9 March 1968, PERSAVAL again discussed the matter
    with LIRING-3, saying that one of the two travellers possessed
    legal travel documents. Since the other person has no such
    legal documents, they should enter Guatemala illegally.

/MEXI-4790/

4.  LIRING-3 reported on 27 March 1968, that one of the
    traveller to Guatemala is FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS.
    The group is of the opinion that LIRING-3 should also go to
    Guatemala in order to meet an unidentified woman, described
    as the FAR logistics officer, to discuss FAR support from
    Mexico.

/MEXI-5000/

5.  Departure was delayed because LARA sustained a self-
    inflicted gun shot wound while cleaning a weapon. On 10 April
    LIRING-3, LARA, and another person--described as a member of
    the YON SOSA Faction--departed en route to Guatemala.
    LIRING-3 was informed that the FAR and the YON SOSA group
    are now working together, but that a certain amount of
    compartmentation exists.

6. During the 14-15 April week-end, Guatemalan authorities arrested three individuals near the Mexican border. They were brought to Guatemala City where they are being held for interrogation.
   The persons arrested are:
   a. FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS (Guatemalan)
   b. CARLOS JURADO DEL MAR (Mexican)
   c. CARLOS MANUEL PERSAVAL MARCUE (Mexican)
   When arrested LARA admitted that he is a Communist, and that he is returning to Guatemala to renounce his affiliation.

7. The G-2 of the Guatemalan military was not successful in its interrogation of the Subjects. Liaison attempted it but wa. compelled to conduct its interrogation in the presence of G-2 officials who continually interrupted. Liaison was attempting additional interrogation under more favorable circumstances, Meanwhile G-2 is considering turning over the Subjects to the "Army Special Unit" for further interrogation.

Operations Against PBRUMEN Targets Inverving LIRING-3, LIRING-4,

1. The development, handling, and exploitation of any asset under false pretenses by someone operating under false flag has and will continue to have many drawbacks. In the case of LIRING-3/LIRING-4 the situation is further complicated by the fact that PBRUMEN nationals at home and in LIRING (the main target against whom the two have been directed) have long suspected their motives for maintaining contact and wanting to cooperate with them. The ups and downs of the LIRING-3/LIRING-4 marital relations have from time to time further complicated the conduct of operations involving them. The Station can understand that Headquarters has some reservations on the conduct of these operations. They have been complicated, time consuming, and have blown hot and cold depending on the state of mind of the PBRUMENers at the time and the difficulties between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. Because of incomplete control, an almost inescapable feature of this type of operation, a considerable effort was made to check the reliability of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. This involved LIFEAT coverage, audio monitoring (LIROSIN), and occasional

surveillance by the LIEMBRACES. The results, at least in the PBRUWEN phase of this operation, have been unspectacular so far. The main usefulness of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 has been a) as access agents to LIRING, (although this has been largely reduced to the LIRING Consulate), and b) to introduce Wallace B. ROWTON to visiting PBRUMEN officials and members of the local leftist community with access to PBRUMEN and LIRING. A major effort was started recently to take this operation up one more notch and, taking advantage of a recent crisis in the relations between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4, send the latter to PBRUMEN on a mission to assess and hopefully recruit new sources of information. The exploitation of LIRING-3's contacts with representatives of the Guatemalan FAR rebel movement was the object of separate correspondence. LIRING-3's renewed contacts with these representatives do not at this time involve PBRUMEN, although the latter clearly supports at least some of their activities.

2. Forwarded under separate cover are fifteen reports prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON on the activities of LIRING-3, IIRING-4, and come of their contacts from late January to 31 March 1968. The Station has noted Headquarters' desire for more frequent progress reports per reference A. It felt, however, that in this case partial reporting of LIRING-4's difficulties in obtaining a PBRUMEN visa (by far the most important aspect of this operation during the period under review) could have been misleading, as the situation changed several times and LIRING-4 did not really know what to expect from LIRING from one meeting with its representatives to the ext, not to again mention the ups and downs of the LIRING-3/ LIRING-4 relationship, which hit a new low during this period. The Station would like to point out in passing that, in addition to cable reporting and dispatches transmitting ROWTON'S contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 are involved in are reviewed in some detail in the over-ail monthly report submitted by the PBRUMEN Section of this Station.

3. The last time LIRING-4 accompanied LIRING-3 to PBRUMEN, she obtained an entry visa in a few days. LIRING-4 thus felt that as an ex-employee of LIRING with good connections in PBRUMEN and LIRING she would obtain a new PBRUMEN entry visa fairly easily. Entry visas are now quite a bit more difficult to obtain, however, for PPRUMEN nonofficial citizens abroad. It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN for an extended period of time, as this was obviously based on a domestic quarrel. LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 have had other quarrels, and the LIRING staff may have thought that this last one would subside and that LIRING-4 would postpone or cancel her plans for going to PBRUMEN. It was to convince the LIRING staff that the difficulties with his wife were serious that. LIRING-3. first went to LIRING. In a maneuver to further convince the LIRING employees, particularly LIRING-2 and LIRING-9, that LIRING-4 seriously wanted to go to PBRUMEN as a result of domestic problems, ROWTON decided to have LIRING-3 openly question LIRING-4's right to take their child with her. It must be remembered that, in Mexico, a wife cannot leave the country, and especially take a child with her, without the express and official consent of the husband. This little scenario appears to have been well played. On the other hand, it did not help LIRING-4 obtain a visa any faster. LIRING-2 appeared to be waiting, among other things, for LIRING-3 to arrive at a decision regarding their child accept- able to his wife. LIRING-3 finally "agreed" to let LIRING-4 take the child at his 26 February meeting at LIRING. Two days before, LIRING-4 had been told by LIRING-2 that the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 90

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

SECRET
HAMA - 34484

"consejo superior" of LIRING, of which he said he was a member, had not yet taken up her case. This was indirectly confirmed by LIRING-16, who told LIRING-4 the same day that nothing about her visą case had yet been sent to PBRUVEN as he would othornisc kod it, since be handled all visa correspondence.

4. There is naturally the possibility that LIRING-4's visa request was handled by LIRING via classified correspondence not seen by LIRING-16. This channel may have been used because LIRING-4's visa request brought out the old problem of LIRING-3's reliability in the eyes of the PBRUWEvers. Although LIRING-2, LIRING-9, and Identity appeared sympathetic toward LIKING-4 and her projected visit to PBRUMEN (to the point where they advised her on more than one occasion not to come back to Mexico), they, at the same time, sought to clarify two things. They first made another attempt to throw some light on the sources through which LIRING-3 had obtained information of particular interest to LIRING. Secondly they brought up the question of "the Greek" (ROWTON) and tried to obtain answers to pertinent questions. LIRING, as mentioned by poth LIRING-2 and mentity, 15 10 used Loveing given sensitive information without at the same time obtaining good source description. Specifically, how did LIRING-3 hear of the arrest of the LIRING member involved in a subversive case In 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the report on Rico GALAN which he passed to LIRING, and how could he have learned of certain of the activities of Moises OROZCO Leal? To all these questions LIRING-3 replied by saying that he had good sources in Mexico and Central America and that he was not about to divulge them to the PBRUMENers. Both LIRING-2 and Identity in their conversations with LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 took pains to say that LIRING-3's conduct in his dealings with LIRING and PBRUMEN was "above reproach." They wanted to be sure, however, that he "had not fallen victim to unscrupulous elements constantly surrounding the revolution." To quote the old cliche, LIRING-3 "got their message."

5. ROWTON'S introduction to LIRING-2 and other LIRING members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings with LIRING-2 were bound to make the latter somewhat curious about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of "the revolution" who seems to travel extensively and appears to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts of the world. LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON'S criticism of the LIRING efficiency (see ROWTON's report dated 1 January sent as an attachment to reference B) since he finally phoned ROWTON's "office" after the incident described in ROWTON's 1 January report. For some reason LIRING-2 made the call on a legal holiday when offices are usually closed, and the operator of ROWTON's answering service answered "Mr. ROWTON's (in alias) office." This apparently made LIRING-2 even more inquisitive. During a one hour meeting at LIRING on 15 February LIRING-2 asked LIRING-4 about her relationship with "the Greek." LIRING-2 wanted to know where and for whom he worked, et cetera. ROWTON's report of 17 February covers this conversation in detail. LIRING-2: appeared to suspect ROWTON may have been one of the sources of the information passed LIRING by LIRING-3 and warned LIRING-4 "to go easy with the Greek," if not for her sake, at least for LIRING-3, who "has not always treaded on firm ground." LIRING-4 provided some "information" on her Greek acquaintance on 24 February. ROWTON, who had briefed her in detail on what


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 91

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

## SECRET HMMA - 34484

she should tell LIRING-2, felt, after listening to LIRING-4's report, that the latter had at least partly succeeded in lessening LIRING-2's suspicions. These suspicions may have been further reduced after LIRING-3's discussion with LIRING-2 on 26 February. ROWTON did expect LIRING-2's questions and felt in the end that he had "passed the test."

6. The Station does not know at this point whether LIRING-4 will get a PBRUMEN 'entry visa but is still optimistic that she will. The PBRUMENers appear convinced that there is serious trouble between her and LIRING-3, and LIRING-1, to whom LIRING-4 wrote for help recently, asked her to be patient, pointing out that red tape in PBRUMEN takes time. The possibility that the PBRUMENers may allow LIRING-4 in their country to interrogate her about the activities of her husband and some of her friends has occurred to ROWTON and the Station. Such a possibility is, however, most unlikely as the object of the PBRUMEN suspicions is LIKING-3 and net LIRING-4, who has several times told them that she knows little of what LIRING-3 does. The most important consideration, however, is that LIRING-4 is married to a Mexican citiza, and as suspicious as they may be of the latter's doings, the

ODDIOs have to the host of our modo proof that this Mexican has done anything against their regime. On the contrary, LIRING-3 has time and again warned them of impending difficulties or problems. The fact that LIRING-4 is married to a Mexican and that she enjoys the status of immigrant in Mexico is also the best assurance that she would be allowed to return to Mexico, as the PERUMENers want no trouble with the Mexicans. The SGSWIRL examination recently given LIRING-4 has cleared the air at least on two points. First, that LIRING-4 is not an enemy penetration, and, second, that she has not revealed the nature and extent of her contacts with ROWTON to anyone else than LIRING-3. The Station agrees with ROWTON that LIRING-4 would, if given a chance, prove herself to be a good asset. As for the question of being left with continuing obligations in this operation, both LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 know that there is little ROWTON could do beyond providing legal-type advice to bring LIRING-4 back to Mexico if the PBRUMENers refused to allow her to return to her husband, an unlikely possibility as mentioned above in view of current Mexican/PBRUMEN relations. The letter of understanding signed by LIRING-4 specifies the extent of ROWTON's commitment and leaves no doubt as to the extent of his obligations. The Station hopes that LIRING-4's relationship with LIRING-3 will not improve with time to the point where she will lose the proper motivation and cover to undertake the mission to PBRUMEN for which she has been trained and briefed.

7. The attempt made to exploit Carmen LOZADA's trip to PBRUMEN to obtain assessments and vulnerability information on a number of persons she knows who have operational potential turned out to be a complete failure. LOZADA ran into such difficult family problems in PBRUMEN that she had no time (or, as it turned out, desire) to obtain the information requested of her. The strain of her personal problems was such that she nearly had a nervous breakdown after returning to Mexico City on 16 February. Not even LIRING-3 could get anything out of her. The victim of a type of family blackmail by her pro- AMTHUG husband, LOZADA returned to PBRUMEN on 15 March. ROWTON did not fare much better with Rodolfo REYES Cortes, who returned to Mexico City in early March. REYES, who is preparing to go to Chile to put on a ballet performance, has. been extremely busy since his return with private and professional matters. ROWTON nevertheless managed to debrief

AL
Oce: Dirt
him at least partially on his contacts in PBRUMEN. The only
concrete result of REYES' trip to PBRUKEN so far is the contact
which he made with Sukendah HANAFI, the ex-Ambassador of
Indonesia in Havana. According to REYES, HANAFI expressed
interest in meeting POSTON to "work something out" to the
mutual advantage of both the Greek and Indonesian revolutions.
After a couple of phone calls, it turned out, however, that
HANAFI would probably be unable to obtain a Mexican entry visa.
The Station believes, anyway, that little would be gained by
a meeting. From the information at hand, HANAFI is a convinced
leftist who does not lack for money and seems to have an!
enjoyable life in PBRUWEN. The Station is finally not
interested in the Indonesian "revolution" or in what HANAFI
could do to help the Greek leftists.

8. If she does not go to PBRUMEN an effort will be made
   to further exploit the antagonism LIRING-4 has developed for
   the personnel of LIRING in the course of her attempts to
   obtain a PBRUMEN visa to obtain additional operational :
   information on LIRING and its employees. LIRING-4 has been
   so humiliated and angered that she is willing to do literally

   has already been used unwittingly for MECREDO purposes.

   connection with an audio operation against the "safe room" of
   the LIRING Consulate.

Subject: SGS/IRL Examination of LIRING/4.

1. LIRING/4 was given an SGS/IRL examination from about 1030 until 1300 on 31/3/68 at room 602 of the Hotel del Bosque on Calle Melchor Ocampo. Rowton rented the suite in the name Nicolas Spyropoulos and no security problems were encountered in using this site.

2. Rowton first proposed the examination to LIRING/4, after discussing it briefly with LIRING/3, at 1600 on 30/3/68 in the coffee shop of the Hotel Bosque in the presence of the examiner. L/4's initial reaction was almost identical to that of LIRING/3 - one of shock, indignation, and outright refusal on the ground that it was "servil" and beneath her dignity at any price. She made it clear that she felt she had been and was taking all the risks and considered it completely unfair that she should have to subject herself to such a "police" interrogation when she had done nothing wrong and in fact knew nothing about Rowton. At one point she commented that this whole thing made her think that Rowton was an agent of WORACT. She did not dwell on this point, however, or return to it subsequently.

3. In view of this unfavorably turn at the initial session Rowton agreed with the examiner that the latter should gracefully bow out and give Rowton a chance to soften L/4 up by a more thorough explanation, especially since L/4 refused flatly to accompany Rowton and the examiner to the safehouse room upstairs. Rowton then spent the next two hours explaining the test emphasizing that it would not include any indiscriminate frivolous questions and that L/4 would know beforehand what the precise questions were. Rowton made it clear that he was interested mainly in determining whether L/4 had betrayed him to her LIRING contacts and had any sort of secret agreement with PERUMEN to work against him. L/4 finally agreed to take the examination the following morning since as she stated her conscience was clear.

4. The responses appeared favorably on pertinent questions and the control question on any theft of money (suggested by Rowton on the basis of the report given to him in confidence by LIRING/3 that L/4 had taken 2,000 pesos from the LIRING safe which she almost immediately replaced on his insistence) proved to be excellent. L/4 did not reveal the specific theft but she was evidently thoroughly convinced after the test that the SGS-IRL is reliable and cannot be beaten Rowton and the examiner felt it unwise to break her on this control question since it would prove counterproductive and would probably expose L/3 as the source. The test will probably serve as an excellent deterrent and additional control for future assessment of L/4 and evaluation of her reporting.

Subject: LIRING/4 Repart of Status of Request for ke-entry Permit.

1. Foaten zet with LIRING/4 at her reçuest at 1630 on 23/3/68 at the Denny's Restaurant (Reforma Mana) to discuss the status of her visa (re-entry) reçuest. She stated that she had just received a letter from her friend Doctor Yolanda Díaz, transmitted through Jorrin and given to her by the latter that same morning. The translation of the text of the letter is as follows:

"Año del Guerrillero Heróico"
La Habana.Febrero 9/68

Sra.
México, D.Z.

Dear

I explained to you last night when we spoke (on the telephone) the processing of your entry is being held up because of a number of things that have to be done which in kin view of the pricrities you know exist result in its not being done as rapidly as one would wish.

I don't think you should be discouraged and rest assured that as soon as it comes through, we'll advise you, especially since Abreu is going to follow it through. Eisses to your child and regards to Carlos.

/s/ Yolanda

2. The letter, a copy of which was made by Howton, also contains a P.S. from Abreu, a translation of which follows:

I'm taking an interest in your matter. As Yolanda explains red tape takes tize. I received your cable and letter.

Fondly,
/s/ Abreu

3. LIRING/4 called to Rowton's attention the length of time (almost six weeks) for the letter to reach her dispite the fact that Abreu tinself most probably forwarded it through the pouch. 1/4 commented that when she re- marked this to her friend Catalina Cepero, the latter stated that she had received a ltter in the pouch the same day but it was dated in December, 1967, and ancther from Yolanda dated February 9,1965.

4. LIKI.G/4 also reported that she had finally managed to talk with her father on the telephone, and, although he appeared uneasy and soceatat abrupt (seco), she was reassured that he was in reasonably good health. She finally assured Howton that she no longer suspected him of any foul play and agreed that her father was apparently acting on the advice of his lawyer in con- nection with the visa reuqest of her brother (to emigrate to the U.S.) that was being processed in New York.

Subject: LIRIE 3/4 Report of News Concerning her Father in New York.

1.  At 1600 on 22/3/68 Roston visited LIRING/4 at her residence to discuss with her a report she had received from a mutual friend concerning her father. Earlier in the day LG/3 had informed doston that LIRING/4 had received a disturbing piece of news to the effect that someone had approached her father in New York City and told him to break off all contact with LIRING/4 in order to avoić jeopardising his residence in the U.S. According to LIRING/3, LIXG/4 was convinced as a result of this report that Roxton, and possibly with the knowledge of LIRING/3 himself, had arranged this approach to precluže any Kuxcontact L/4 night have had with her father that sight jeopardise her mission to iievana. Rowton assured LIRING/3 that he had take no such action and armood to talk to 10000uie der also since according to LIKEG/3 she was very upset and her confidence in both Rowton and Li3/3 himself shaker.

2.  Roxton reassured 121SG/4 when he saw her but, of course, could not furnish proof of any kind that he had not intervened. He asked several times the identity of the source, but LIKING/4 seatfastly refused to divulge it, saying only that a larger friend of her father had written to her stating that the reasca her father had not communicated with her over kkak the past three sonths and had nct answered her letters and telephone calls was that "they" had told him not to maintain ary contact with his daughter at the risk of Closing his residence in the 5.5. Roxton asked whether the lawyer's name was Portuondo (a lead furnished by LIRING/3) but 1/4 would not confira or deny this, syaing simply that she would look into the matter herself. She said that she suspected corton since he was the only person to whom she had given her father's address in New York and she could not imagine why any other person would have a motive to contact her father in that way. She added that if her father had just given her some sort of explanation she could understand, but acting the way he did indicated that someone had terrorized hia into complete silence. Rowton again insisted that he did not in any way contact her father, and would never have done so without first consulting her. He sur ised that possibly her father's lawyer had counseled him to break off contact in connection with the application her father was making t for a visa for LIELEG/4's brother on the ground that the American authorities night deny the visa if they knew of LIRIHG/4's previous employment in the LIRING offices.

1.  Rodolfo Reyes Cortes informed Foxton 8/3/68 that while in Havana he discussed with his friend Sukenian Hanafi, ex-Indcresian Ambassador to Cuba, possibility of collaboration with his Greek leftist businessman friend both in international commercial deals and politically. According Reyes, Hanafi expressed immediate interest, accepting Reyes' word that he could place full trust in Horton. Hanafi stated that he felt something could be worked out to their mutual advantage of both the Greek and the Indonesian revolution, since se had contact himself with the liberation army of Indonesian.

2.  Hanafi asked Reyes to return to Mexico City, preferably in Mexico City where Reyes could make the introduction personally, but indicating that he might run into difficulty in obtaining a visa. He added that if Mexico City not possible he would travel to Paris where he has never had visa trouble.

3.  Reyes reported to Rowton on 11/3/68 that he had talked to Hanafi on telephone asking him arrange trip soonest to Mexico City, but Hanafi had replied that his initial check had revealed Mexicans would insist on clearance with Indonesian Embassy Mexico City prior to issuance of visa. Hanafi added, however, that he taking matter up with Raúl ñoa and might be able arrange some sort of official travel to facilitate issuance of visa. He promised advise Reyes soonest since he aware that Reyes must leave for Chile by end March (as soon as his wife, Tatiana, obtains Chilean visa).

Subject: LIRING/4 Report of Contact with LIZING/2 and LIRING/9.

1. At 0930 on 9/3/68 LIANG/4 reported to howton that she had again on 2/3 visited the LIRING establishment to check on the status of her re-entry permit. She stated that LIKING/2 was cordial out politiely passed the buck on her re-entry permit to LIRILG/9, stating that it was a matter for L/9's office and that in any case he himself was so busy looking for a house for the Chief that he could not do anything else at the moment. Ze said in passing that he had to go to Acapulco that evening and would te there until Sunday night ( 10/3/63). He jokingly invited L/4 along for the ride. He also commented that he himself would be back in Havana about June and why didn't L/4 wait to go back with him. He added that in any case he hoped to see her there.

2. LIRING/4 also reported that Echenendía ( Ismail Suarez de la Paz), who happened to be present when she was talking to L/2, commented that his wife would be leaving on the 11 arch flight and that he himself expected to be returning in about two weeks. L/4 then commented sarcastically that at the rate things were going with 1/2 she would probably be still waiting for her entry permit when he left and in that case he could personally expedite it. L/2 then by way of apology stated that the mother-in-law of the Swiss Ambassador had been waiting for over three weeks for her entry visa and there was nothing he could do to speed things up from this end. L/4 replied that this was after all little consolatica for her, although she felt very sorry for the Swiss mother-in-law.

3. LIRING/4 continued to Rowton that she then spoke briefly with LIRING/9 who greeted her cordially and asked ter to take a coffee with him in his private office. On entering this office L/4 noted that the plaster had falle: from the ceiling just above the desk and L/9 commented that hexpł it had just happened the day before and that he hoped to have it repaired soon. He added that he would also be getting better furniture and some pictures to decorate the bare walls. L/4 noted that the phone was still attached to the wall and no lamp of any kind was in the room.

4. According to L/4, LIRING/9 is still waiting for a reply from Havana re her re-entry permit, and hoped to have some reply by 11/3/68. His secretary privately assured L/4 that she would let her now at once if anything came in. LIRILG/4 also reported to newton that she talked to her fitend

Yolanda Díaz on the telephone as a follow-up on her telegram to ask Ramiro Abreu to expedite her request for the re-entry permit. L/ told Roxton that Yolanda explained that she had been unable to contact Abreu at first but finally got to him on 8/3/68 and he promised to do what he could soonest, although he commented that it would be impossible to do anything over the week-end.

5. LIRING/4 also reported to Roxton that she had talked briefly with srta Esperón of L/2's office and was surprised to hear her complain of the "in-supportable" conditions under which she had to work. Srta Esperón said that she had been employed in the LIRING offices for the past 38 years and prior to the revolution had been relatively happy. Lately, however, everything was full of mystery, all doors and cabinets locked up, and nobody trusting anyone. She confided in 1/4 that she had had enough ("basta") and was afraid that she would have to leave, abandoning any hope she still had of getting her pension after so many years.

Subject: Miscellaneous Information Furnished by LIZING/4.

1 March, 1963

1. At his meeting with LI..ING/4, on the morning of 1 March, 1968, Rowton asked L/4 for various miscellaneous information that might be of use to the Station. L/4 recalled that when she worked in the Consulate office, the combination of the safe was as follows:

4 times to right, stopping at 10,
3 times to left, stopping at 65,
2 times to right, stoppingat 75,
then turn to left until one can feel tumbler drop in place.

2. L/4 also furnished Rowton with information for the attached sketch of the consular office where she formerly worked, indicating the location of the safe (in the corner concealed behind a wooden door locked by key). Likewise 1/4 gave details of the office of Abelardo Curbelo which she stated he shared with his new secretary, Conchita - the wife of the Olympic attaché.

3. L/4 also told Rowton that she learned recently from Jorrin that all confidential papers are now handled and processed by one person. 1/4 added that she learned from conversation with MercededMartinez Moreno de Gonzalez that she is in fact the person handling the confidential documents. She stated to L/4 that she has to process the confidential papers of all the offices, specifically Curbelo, Cicard, Luna, as well as her husband's,(Cruz) and Martinez'. L/4 explained to Rowtonthat previously each' office handled its own confidential documents, and filed them in their respective safes.

4. L/4 also gave Rowton the form given her by the Consulate to be filled in for the "Registro de Ciudadano. Cubanos". L/4 explained that she alleged that she had lost the original form given to her and thus obtained another so that she could provide Rowton with a sample of the form( attached herewith).

5. L/4 also reported that, as Rowton had requested, she typed out a letter to her father (given to the Station) at 1330 on 1 March, 1968, on the consulate typewriter. She regretted not having been able to obtain the name of the typewriter since it was not visible on the case. When she asked Adis E. Lopez de Valdes the name the latter surprised her be saying that L/4 was the second person to ask for such information that day. In view of that comment, L/4 felt she could not press for the information desired.

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Conversation with LIRING/2.

1. At 0930 on 27/2/68 LIRING/3 reported to nowton that he had spoken briefly to Echenendía (Ismail Suarez de la Paz) on 24/2/66 and to LIKING/2 at some length on 26/2/68 in the LIRING offices. L/3 explained to nowton that Echemendía had passei a message to him through 1/4 that he wanted to talk to him and that he would telephone himto arrange a meeting. 1/3 continued that chenendía finally con acted him by phone at about noon on 24/2/63 and asked him to come to the LixinG office that afternoon. 1/3 told Rowton that when he finally saw Echemendía the latter was very vague ana general in hs statements and that all he could gather from his state- ments was that schemendia was apologetic for the "misunderstanding" that had arisen as a result of L/+'s request for a re-entry permit. Echerencia stated that "we" are concerned that 1/3, whom they considered honest and above reproach in his dealings with PERU, might have fallen victen to unscupluous elements who constantly surround the revclution. L/3 confessed to kowtn that this vague and almost inccherent line of Echemendia annoyed him to such an extent that he felt it useless to continue his conversation with him and as a result terminated it at the first opportunity.

2. LIKING/3 continued thathe net with HIRING/2 on 26/2/68 at the latter's office with much more fuitful results. According to L/3, L/2 began by stating that "they" appreciated the information L/3 had passed to them at various times in the past, specifically the report of Julian Lopez' arrest, the proposed publication of the arest in the Guatemalan press, the report concerning the letter of Rico Galán and the Crozco afair, but they were frankly perflexed with regard to the source of such sensitive iaforastion. 1/3 told Rowton that he explained to 1/2 that he had excellent Central Ame- rican contacts, as well as Mexican sources in good positions, who could fur- nish such information witout naming anyone. He told 1/2 that he had no in- tention of jeopardising his business contacts by revealing their isentity, and he felt that what he had done was in the interest of PERUMEN and the revolution, and that L/2 and his friends should not lock a gift horse in the mouth and see spies behind every blade of xxxxx grass, just becasue they themselves had no capability to check out his reports.

3. 1/3 then told howton that L/2 asked directly aboot "el Griego" and his relationship to 1/3. 1/3 stated that he feigned surprise and asked hat Greek", adding that he knew several Greeks in Guatemala, Venezuela and Ne- xico. L/2 clarified by stating that he meant the Greek introduced to him

by Rodolfo Reyes. 1/3 then exclaimed: "Ch, you mean señor Harris." to which 1/2 replied in the affirmative. L/3 then explained that he felt that sr. Harris was a high-minded revolutionary with high level contacts through- out the world developed through his cusiness Exaxacts relationships who haa helped him a great deal over the past two years both financially and morally
then asked L/2 335 ionel business, το wich L/2 replied that he kne practically nothing, 1/3 told nowten that he then closed in with a scuewhat elaborate explanation of how international busi nessmen acquire valusable bits of inteeligence with trying as a result of the sensitive relacionship they develop with political personalities in various governments. 1/3 stated to Rowton that he felt 1/2 was impressed *favorably*with his explanation, since he finally stated that in reality "they" (meaning himself, Sergio Martinez, Ismail Suarez de la Paz and Cepeda), the Consejo Superior de la Embajada" had nothing against sr. Harris but simply that they did not know enough about him. L/2 then stated that L/3 must realize that the revolution was surrounded by provocateurs and that when they have the least suspicions that they must put on "the amber light" of caution. 1/3 then stated that his dealings with sr. Harris were sensitive high-level business negotiations for the procurement of sulphur and that he could produce documents to prove this. L/2 replied thatthis was not at all necessary and that it was simply just a question of knowing a little more about the sources available to L/3 and about the "Greek". L/3 conluded with a statement that 1/2 must in the last analysis weigh the en- tire affair in terms of whether L/3 in fact had ever done anything against the revolution. 1/2 replied without hesitation that everyone felt that L/3 had always acted in good faith and had the best of intentions. It was simpl; that they felt that L/3 might have become a victim of a provocateur without realizing it.

4. L/2 then stated that he had no objection to giving L/4 an entry permit but he hoped that 1/3 was not just trying to solve a domestic problem by sending her back to her mother. L/3 replied that there was in fact a serious domestic problem and confessed that he had had an affair with another woman which 1/4 had discovered but he felt this was a very personal problem about which 1/2 should not be concerned. L/2 replied that he agreed with this and was concerned simply about the child whe88 he felt L/4 should be permitted to take with her. 1/3 told Rowton that he finally conceded to L/2 that per- haps he was right and that he should be more considerate of L/4 and permit her to take the child to Liavana. L/3 told Rowton that the meeting with L/2 ended on a rather cordial note and that he had the impression that 1/2 would grant 1/4 the re-entry permit without further delay.

Subject: LIRING/4 Report of Conversation with LIRING/2.

1. 1/4 reported to Rowton at 1045 on 24 February, 1962, that she had again spoken to IIREG/2 about her entry permit to return to Cavana. She appeared depressed and began the conversation stating that she was "fed up" (tapta) with the LIKIG office, explaining that she felt that she had been treated very unfairly and shabbily, particularly by LIRING/2. She stared that she had waited for several hours to see LINING/2 on the aroning of 23 February inside the premises of the LIRING offices but had finally to leave after only a few words of conversation with him. She -related that LIING/2 and LIKING/9 were cccupied in conversation with Eugenia Clguin(who had recently returned from a three-months stay in havana with he sister Farcela) and she did not feel it proper to interrupt to ask about her permit to return to Cuba. when she finally button-holed HAI/2, he said that he would rather talk to her the following morning - about 1000, since it was Saturxday, explaining that he was very busy with a number of difficult cases.

2. LISTING/4 continued that when she returned to his office about 1015 the following morning ( 24 February) she again had to wait about 15 zinutes before finding LIRING/2 alone. To her annoyance he again brushed her off, stating that he still did not have a final answer since the matter had not as yet been taken ur by the "consejo supericr" of the establishment. L/2 continued that he hoped to have some sort of decision by Konday and asked 1/4 to see him again. L/4 stated to Rowton that she could not contain her-feelings any longer and exploded in a burst of investive again the LIRING office, accusing them among other things of giving visas to all sorts of hippies and delinquents and making her wait on pins and needles when she had a right to return. L/4 then stated that just as she was leaving, she turned to 1/2 and said: "Ch, I forget to tell you, but I managed to see the 'Greek'" 1/4 told Rowton that at this L/2 came suddenly back to life and invited her into his office again, closing the door and ushering her to a chair. She then stated that she had telephoned "the Creek" (Roxton) on the pretext that she wanted him to buy some jewelry for her on his next trip to Switzerland and succeeded in having coffee with him at Sanborns. She continued that in the course of conversation she learned that his tele-phone is actually an answering se vice and hence operates 24 hours per day, and that he is interested in buying sulphur in Mexico and that his principal client is the Greek shipowner, Niarchos. She then showed 1/2 a natchbox on which the Greek had written the neme Niarchos in both Greek and English


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

2. script, since she pretended to be curicus about the spelling of the name.
   According to 1/4, 1/2 snatched up the match-box with expressions of appreciation, and continued to listen with interest. 1/4 continued that the Greek explained to her the difficulties and complexities of working with the Mexicans in procuring sulphur and other critical products, but she confessed to 1/2 that she chew nothing about such matters and felt very confused. She commented, however, that the Greek appeared quite relaxed and willing to answer her questions. She added that shen she turned the conversation on Cuba, the Greek replied that he was interested naturally as a good revolutionary, but frankly was very disappointed ("decepcionado") at the treatment received by the LIRING officials he had met, including L/2. L/4 continued that the Greek-end-commented that he had many dealings with foreign officials in his normal business operations but had never enccuntered the discourtesy shown by, who did tais telephone calls. L/4 conluded with a statement that she felt the Greek was no longer interested in Cuba and assumed that he had obtained whatever information he needed from other sources.

3. LIRING/4 then asked L/2 whether he needed any more information since she might be seeing the Greek once more before he left for Europe again. L/2 replied that he appreciated what she had already obtained and added that he felt it wise in these cases to get to know the person "more and more" before making a judgement. 1/4 told Roxton that at this point she could not refrain from the outburst:" But you have known ne for several years, and you still can't make up your mind. How mch time do you need to figure things out". She told Rowton that L/2 just smiled at this and again asked to be given until Monday for the final answer re the permission to return.

4. LIRING/4 then told Foxton that as she was leaving the precises, she stoppeć briefly to chat with Jorrin. The latter appeared genuinely surprised that LIRING/4 had not as yet been granted her permit. then she commented that probably L/2 had to wait for a reply frca Havana, Jorrín exclaimed:" Ko, that's not probable, since he did not send any cable on you; otherwise I would know". He added as an afterthought that possibly he could have sent a dispatch which he would not know about, but he doubted that in view of the time element involved. Jorrin then commented that"everything"had changed since L/4 had left her job, explaining that now all confidential papers, not only from L/2's cofice but also frcm L/9, the Commerical Section, and fron "Luna's office" were handled by one person rather than as previously by each office, (L/4 commented to Rowton that she had never heard of a person by the name of Luna) and that things in generals had been tightened up froz a security standpoint.

Subject: Carzen Lozada Statments to LIRING/3 re trip.

1. LIRING/3 reorted to aorton at 2130 on 19/2/68 that Carzen Lozača had telephoned him about C530 that morning and that he had seen her again at her request. On this occasion he found her relatively composed and quite coherent as compared to their first meeting since her return.

2. L/3 reported that she stated that the situation in Havana was "chactic" -- econcically a disaster with no rice-on-the-market, gascline rationing (8 gallons per month for crdinary cars and 20 for larger) strictly enforced and police control shrutal". She stated that th Havana airport everything is searched even of Mexicans as herself and what can be taken for personal reasons is removed on the pretext of having it "checked".

3. Carmen Lozada stated specifically to L/3 that she had heard strong rumors in Havana that Fidel Castro would be replaced by Dorticós zainly because of the failure of Fidel's economic policies. It was also rumored that sugar productions would fell far below last year's figure, possibly exceeding 4,000,000 tons by only a fraction. Bad fertilizer хлади KEK is blamed but the general feeling is that it is rather bae zanagement and Fidei's advisers are taking the blame.

4. Carmen also reported that she had heard "confirmed" resorts that César Montes is no longer leader of the Guatemalan revolucion, although she could not say who had replaced him.

LIRING/4 Report of Conversation with Echeme día (İsmail Suarez de la Faz).

1.  LIENG/4 reported to Boston at 1030 on 19/2/68 at the Duca d'Este café that she had met with schemencia for about one hour on 17 Feb- ruary at a small coffee shop off calle Fachuca in Colcnia Condesa. She explained that she had telephoned schemendia fromthe home of her friend Blanca Peña de azand and arranged to reet him about 1730 at 3 nearby corner.

2.  LIRING/4 stated that Echenendía was cordial as usual and told her that he hoped looked forward- t. seeing her again whenever she felt she could go out with him for lunch an dinnon, to asked how at hom twin to Havana and she informed hicthat she hoped to leave on the 23 February flight. Echemendía asked if she thought she might have difficulty re- turning to Mexico, to which 1/4 replied in the negative, commenting that in the past neither the Hexicans nor the Cubans had gives her ar trouble.

3.  According to 2/4, Echenendía then queried bar in some detail about how LIRING/3 was doing, his business in Chiapas, where they were living, and what his plans were. She replied in as matter-a-fact day as possible,al- leging that 1/3 was selling his paintings and doing well in business.

4.  Echemerdía then commented that the LIANG office locally had commented re 1/3 that although they appreciated the information he had passed to the they did not have the sources and details and hence had to view them with suspicion. Echezendía apclogized to ix /4 for having to say this (me da mucha pera) but he felt obliged to pass it along to her. He added that both Havana and LIANG are accustomed to get sources along with the reports turned in to then and always are uneasy when these are lacking. He agreed with 1/4 that 1/3 had acted in good faith, but also defended the position of the land office which he said was surrounded by provactions and infiltrations.

5.  1/4 told ko-ten that she did not tell L/3 about this rendevous with Echezendia (whose a tentions to L/4 in the past have zade 1/3 particularly jealous and annoyed) since she did not want to disturb hia) LEDG/3, however, reported to howton at about 2100 the previous evening (13/2/68) in an obviously irritated tone that by pure chance he had seen Schemendía and LIRING/4 together at a coffee shop about 1800 on 17/2/68. when douton. explained that he had known of and approved of the meeting beforehand, Lails/3 calmed down and shrugged it off.

2. 1/4 departure which originally scheduled for 16 February 1968, will be delayed until following Friday to permit intensive como and security training, and strengthen backstop for objective of trip. Cr 12 February LIRING/2 told 1/4 that he would issue perzit to return and, in expression apparently genuine sympathy, ursed her take twin and mossialobash belonged". On morning 13 February Echemandía (Ismail Suarez de la Paz) who net L/4 by chance inside iIRIng compound remarked he happy to learn she going back home for a trip and then added "go back and stay2. He then invited her to lunch or dinner out 1/4 felt is wise to turn hin dom first time. They had lunch inxixx LIRING dining room. On Routen suggestion she will, however, accept for outside lunch so sound him out farther on his reaction to her return.

3. Simultaneously in order build up conviction in minds LERING officials that 1/4 returning becasue of narital problem with LIENG/3 (which she herself stated to Rowton that she hesitated to reveal to anyone), 3 talked with LIRIG/2 in his office 13 February (at moment 1/4 elsewhere in LIRING offices) and pretended to have just learned of 1/4's request for permission to return. L/3 in angry tone alleged that he could not understand why L/4 would want to return, that he had treated her as well as he could, and that in any case he would not permit her to take their daughter. LIRING/2 although obviously somewhat embarassed took 1/4's part and urged L/3 to reconsider and give permission to L/4 to take daughter along since she would be reluctant to leave as a "good mother". L/2 rent so far as to state that if L/3 insisted it would be tantacount to "blackmail" against LIRING/4. L/2 continued that he felt obliged as a LIRING cfficial; to grant LIRING/4 permission to return but he did not want to oblige her to depart without her child. HIRING/3 told howton that he did not give in and left LIRING/2 with the impression that his mind was made up regarding the child.

it later when informed by Boston as being in her best interest, She agreed that child could not be properly taken care of at mother's home in Santiago becasue of short supply of essential food with neither parent present, that her departure without child would permit frequent correspondence with 1/3, and provide excellent pretext for return to Mexico (to convince 1/3 to percit her move child to Havana with her once she established.

5. For häotrs info, Rowton convinced that LIRILG/3 wants permanent separation from LIZING/4 feeling that situatica has become "intolerable", whereas IIRING/4 still hoping against hope that their domestic difficulties can be patched up and that when she returns they can resume normal sarital relations. The insisted to Borton that she would remain loyal to him and do nothing to increase his antipathy for her. (Rcwton feels this is tro- bably best control that can be hoped for in her operational work).

6. Following lengthy meetings with 1/4, Rowton has eveluved following operational plan with her approval:

(a) LIRILG/4 on arrival will re-establish contact with and assess the following contacts:

(1) Ramiro Abreu
(2) Arnol and fuby (wife) Rodriquez
(3) Caribel Guilfrido
(4) Capt Luis Carballo and wife
(5) Lcló de la Corriente
((5) Mercedes Ecrales Lereverent.

These persons will be referred to in 3/ messages by number only for security reasons. 1/4 knows that numbers three and five have already expressed strong anti-revolutionary sentiments and will attempt discreetly to determine present attitude and access.

(b) Discreet efforts will be made learn of efficiency and močus operandi of DSE. IG/4 insisted on this for her out o Itection since Boston alleged that he could not provide her with necessary briefing. She feels confident that she can get at least some basic data from haciro Abreu. L/4 commented that she alzost certain the CSE de manipluated by a "foreign service" since she certain thas Cubans themselves incapble of efficient and secure operations.

(c) when 1/4 feels she has reached point with any of above that she can make some sort of "deal" (for instance assistance to them from outside in exchange for help to her in finding "interesting position" curing her forced stay there) she will notify Borton by 3/ and proceed further or withdraw as per instructions.

(d) In event. 1/4 meets other persons who might prove recruitable she will mention their names xxx address and position in text of open letter to HAG/3 alding that they send their regards and need, something to available in Cuba. The persons thus zen- tioned will be referred to in 3/1 by next consecutive number in subsequent message. cowton has stressed that he interested only in persons in excellent positions and conceivably recruitable. the list should therefore not be exhaustive.

(e) LIRING/4 wi have two channels for 3/4. First to "Lic. Antonio Ecoce with false return a dress and sent through open mail, and second to LIEI3/3 sent by hand through Ramiro Abreu to ERING office and delivered by band by Jorrin to Cacubaya apartment, or given by 2/4 to some friend traveling to Hexico. In first case all letters cailed, except the frist, will contain 3/ ressage; in second case ail letters with ex- velope bearing "Colonia Concesa" after address will be for Fow- ton and have 3/4. 1/4 promises sent several letters to 1/3 without pessages as soon as she arrives to test channel.

(f) Only channel for incoming messeges for L/4 will be letters from LIRING/3 Ortaining words" Chiapas" and "arte" and either hand carried, sent through pouch, or through open mail.

(C) The following signals have been agreed on for purpose specified:

(1) Danger signal will be absence of name Zinzuni in open text to 1/3. In all acer letters L/4 will mention raze. In event hostile control child will be referred to by icanane, or endearing caprestol ve 200 . ناسنامه

(2) "All my 3-13 complex vitamins are gone" indicates need for new carbon. "I have no more cologne that everyone liked so much" indicates ced for developer.

(3) les carbca sent to LING/3 will be recognized by simple urawing Knix attributed to daughter and sent as expression of sentiment by LIRING/3.

7. In reply her query re best course of action in event she has reports DSE planning arrest, Roxton advised LING/4 destroy S/w supplies, and take refuge in Mexican Embassy in hope that she would be able communicate with CIRING/3 (she did not ask nor did Rowton volunteer how she could notify bin since she assumes Roxton would remain in continuing contact LIRI.G/3).

8. LIRING/4 encouraged by attiĉure ani sympathy shown by HIRING/2 and Echemandía re her remaining in Cuba, but she made it clear to Roxton that she would not do anything jeopardize her residence permit in Eexico or forfeit the time accumulated, unless doston could arrange have Mexican Ambassaćor în avana renew her xxxxxx visa and assure her. She added that best approach would be return after tize up to attempt bring child back and at that time zake new contract with Howton providing for guarantees. Howton agreed stating that he not in position for many reasons, including security, to make such commitments at this time. L/4 made it clear to Rowton also that she realizes that he probably operating in an alias and is affiliated with some sort of service or organization (this came out during discussion of contract and acknowledgement of pseudonym which she did not want), but she stated bluntly that she did not want to know any nore about sowton than the little she already knew since "it would be easier to face an interrogation without betraying him completely".

17 February, 1963

Subject: LIRDG/4 Report of Questioning by LIRING/2 re Rowton ("The Greek").

1. at 1030 on 17 February, 1963, LIRING/4 informed kowton that she had dropped into the LAING offices at about 1230 on 15 February and again on the morning of the following day to check with LIRING/2 concerning her entry permit for travel to Havana. On the first occasion LIRI.G/2 asked her casually whether she had seen anything of the "Greek friend" lately. LIANG/4 told howton that she replied that she and LIRING/3 heard from him from time to time, mainly by telephone, and that he had invited her out cccasionally, but she, LIKG/4, had turned him down.

2. LIRDIG/2 saw L/4 again on the premises and asked to not to leave until she had seen him, since he wanted to discuss something with her. When she fihaliy saw him in his office some 30 minutes later, he again asked whether she had seen the "Greek", not mentioning Rowton by his alias (Harris). Since L/2 had mentioned L/4's Greek friend whom he had met through Rodolfo Reyes on a previously occasion, LIRING/4 felt she could not pretend ot to know about whom he was talking. She therefore replied again that cccasional-ly she heard from him when he was on a trip to Mexico. LIKING/2 asked what L/4 thought of him (the Greek), to which she replied that she found him pleasant and very generous ( bondadoso). L/2 replied, "Yes, but what does that generosity come from?" He then added that he had many question-marks concerning that person. He gave as an example the fact that when he telephoned his number on a holiday, 31 December or 1 January, his "secretary" replied. It seemed very strange, continued L/2, that the Greek's telephone was manned at all times, night and day, and even on holidays. He then further expressed doubts about where this person lived and how he earned his money, and why he was so interested in Cuba.

3. LIRING/4 stated to Rewton that she was st first quite taken aback by this direct "interrogation", even though it was nade in a friendly tone, and replied as best she could by ear. Sne stated that she assumed the Greek was carrying on lucrative business and lived in Europe although she could not supply any specific answers. She was aware that he had brought some of LIRING/3's paintings at an excellent price and took hisgenerosity for granted since she enjoyed living from the good business LIRING/3 gained through him. LIRING/4 then asked L/2 why he himself didn't do some checking of his own, since she assumed the that LIRING office was capable of such


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

2. 
activity when the occasion called for it. LIRING/2 replied that he had too many other things to do, and anyway, when something smelled bad ("apesta") he keeps away from it. LIRING/4, continuing to take the offensive, stated that on several occasions in the past the Greek had invited her out but she had not accepted, but that she easily could accept on the next occasion and possibly even obtain a photo of some kind for LIRING/2. L/2 replied that a photo would not be of any use, all he could do with it being to send it to Havana. He added that he had many suspicions, particularly as a result of the telephone, but had nothing concrete "in his hands", and that what he needed was "datos".

4. LIRING/2 then asked L/4 whether she knew when Rodolfo Reyes was returning and where he would be living? She told Rowton that she replied in the negative, commenting simply that she had heard that he would be moving to Chile to work in the national ballet there. L/2 returning again to the Greek wondered why he was so generous with gifts and entertainment. L/4 stated that she never looked a gift horse in the mouth, to which LIRING/2 replied that she must be careful, if not for her own sake at least for the sake of LIRING/3 who, he felt, was not treading on firm ground ("terreno firme"). L/4 admitted that she was often worried about L/3's activities, about which he told her almost nothing. L/2 then commented "Investigate the Greek and you'll feel better." (Averigua lo del Griego). He then added that that supposed letter from Rico Galán was not considered authentic, and also the case of Orozco definitely involved the police. LIRI 3/4, since she was aware that L/3 had discussed both these cases with L/2, except that L/3 had not to her knowledge mentioned the arrest of Crozco, stated that she felt L/3 had acted in completely good faith, even though he might have been somewhat impulsive ("precipitado").

5. LIRING/2, continuing the conversation, which according to L/4 lasted over one hour, stated that both she and L/3 must be careful of their contacts. He commented that he could not even go out on a date with a girl without thinking of the consequences. He could go out once maybe, but he felt it wiser to drop the contact for security reasonsL/4 told Rowton that she concluded the conversation with a promise to elicit as much data from the Greek as possible as soon as she could get in touch with him.

6. Rowton then told L/4 that he felt relieved in fact that L/2 had brought this whole matter up, since it was better to face such an interrogation here in Mexico rather than in Havana without the benefit of Rowton's advice and briefing. He then stated that he felt it essential that L/4 provide L/2 with much-needed answers to his questions. To avoid the impression of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 115

3. 
collusion, Rowton suggested that L/4 see 1/2 again and ask for Howton's telephone number, which she could alleged she could not find at home and which she preferred not be ask 1/3 for, in order not to arcuse his sus- piciors. Once she obtained the number she could allege that she telephoned Rowton on some pretext ( provided if possible by LIRING/2 himself) and managed to see him at lunch a few days later. She could then report to L/2 that Rowten had told her that his telephone was actually an answering service and hence only messages were taken around the clock. He had no need of an office since he traveled in and out so often and his business did not require an office with the accompanying headaches. L/4 would continue that Rowton confided that he was working on sensitive deals to pur- chase Mexican sulphur ( an expensive and difficult item to procure anywhere in the world at this tine ) and that his principal business connection was with Stavros Kiarcos, the wealthy shipowner. His interest in Cuba stezmed from Niarcos' desire to study the shipping possibilities there in the event the Korthanerican embargo was lifeted.

6. Rowton instructed 1/4 to commented to 1/2 that when she spoke of the LIRDIG office, Kowton appeared very irritated and remarked that he was "decepcionado" with the tre tment he had received from both L/2 and the commerical office. If 1/2 appeared surprised and curious about this, 1/4 could continue that nowton commented to her that he could not understand the cavalier manner in which the LIRINGs did business. He cited the example of at least three telephone calls he had made some weeks previously to both L/2 and the commercial office, leavinf his name and telephone, and what no one had had the courtesy to reply. L/4 could then added that as a result Rowton was aancyed andhad decided to go directly to Eavana to get the info- mation he needed on prospective business on behalf of Kiarcos.

Subject: 10 February, 1968
Briefiing in Communications and Security of LIRING/4.

1.  During the past four days Rowton has had daily meetings with LIRING/4 to give her initial training in 5/2 and discuss chancels of communication that might be used securely and logically by LIRIL G/4 and Roston. A"con- tract" to serve as a letter of understanding for both Rowton and LIRING/4 was drafted as a basis for present and future colaboration. No reference to WOFACT was made or implied, but Acton made it clear that he had "firendi and colleagues" who were interested in intelligence coverage of FERU and who would carry on his collaboration with MAG/4 in the event of Roxton's death or unavailability.

2.  The first item discussed was a simple oven code to desionate poranne of interest either as targets or possible hostile elements, so that L/4. could zention these persons in the text of her 3/W correspondence without compromising herself. A list of the persons concerned with the code nazes is attached herewith. LINING/4 understands that these code names will cat be used in oren letters to LIRING/3 under any circonstances.

3.  As far as letter drops are concerned, Rowton instructed LIRNG/4 to send her 5S/ messages with innocent text cover to the following address:

Lic. Antonio Ponce Cortés
Kultifamiliar Miguel Alemán C-326
México 12, D.F.

using a noticcal return address that could not be easily traced, and drop- ping the letter in a public mailbox in the center of town. Rowton dia not give LIG/4 an indicator for the cover text since it was understood thet all messajes, except the first, would contain an s/w message. LINING/4 Fro mised to zail an innocent text letter as soon after arrival as possible so that Ecwten would have a good idea of the lenth of time invoèved in his receiving future letters.

4.  LIRING/4 was advised that she would receive S/ messages from Rowton on the paper backing of seriographic designs (Aztec seals) being produced by LIRING/3. The designs, prepared in the form of creating cards, would be addressed to a third party and contain a brief message of greeting in the handwriting of LIRING/3 and would be sent as an attachment to a rou- tine letter from LIKING/3 sent by hand or through the LIRING pouch. Both LIRING/4 and sexton agreed that open mail, since it would have to bear her true name and address, would be both too risky and too slow. In the un- likely event of discovery, L/4 would have some day out, alleging that she


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

2. 
had nothing to do with the message and placing the blame on LLC/3.

5. At subsequent meetings, however, LIRING/4 accepted the probable long delays in receiving messages, both to and from her, involved in the open mail and agreed that it would be necessary to take the risk involved in sending at least some of the messages under cover of normal correspondence to LIRING/3. She also agreed with Rowton that sending S/w on the back of seriographic designs would constitute a pattern and might attract undue attention.

6. It was therefore agreed that LIRING/4 would also write S/w in letters to LIRING/3 that would be hand-carried to Mexico by a friend or seat in the pouch and delivered by Jorrin to her Tacubaya address. Rowton structed LIRING/4 to insert "Colonia Condesa" in the address on the envelope if the letter contained S/w, otherwise leave out this addition. Since Rowton would have a key to the Calzada Tacubaya apartment he could check regularly for any letters that Jorrin might have slipped under the door during periods when LIRING/3 might be absent from Mexico City.

7. At his meeting with LIRING/4 on 14/2/68 the following additional signals were agreed on:

(a) Danger Signal : Omision of name Zirzuni from open text. The child would always be referred to in regular correspondence with LIRING/3 by name. In event of hostile control, LIANG/4 would refer to child as "hijita" or by some other endearing name, but refrain from using her first name.

(b) New Carbon Needed: to be indicated by the phrase "I need more vitamin B-12" or "I have run out of my B-12 complex vitamins".

(c) New Developer Needed: "I have run out of that nice cologne I brought with me".

8. As far as incoming S/w was concerned, Rowton stated that if a cover letter from LIREG/3 contained the words "Chiaras" and "arte" it would indicate that an S/w message was being forwarded in that letter.

# 13 February, 1968

Subject: LLI/3 Report of Meeting with Carmen Lozada.

1. At 2100 on 16/2/68 LLI/3 reported to Rowton that he had met with Carmen Lozada at about 1130 on 17/2/62, at the square in Coyacán. He explained that on 15/2/68 their mutual friend, Carmen Molina, had contacted Carmen Lozada by telephone and had learned that the latter planned to return to Mexico the following day (Friday, 16/2/62). Carmen Lozada had told her on the phone to give her regards to her friend ( LLI/3) but to ask him not to meet her at the airport since she would be accompanied by her daughter and would be met by her parents on arrival in Mexico. LLI/3 therefore contacted her through Carmen Molina on the morning of 17/2/68 and made the date to meet her near her parents home.

2. L/3 continued that as soon as he saw Carmen Lozada he knew at once that something unpleasant had happened during her visit to Havana. He told Rowton that she had apparently lost five or six pounds, was dressed in a slovenly manner and gave of appearance of a distraught person, almost on the verge of insanity. Her manner and subsequent conversation, often incoherent and half hysterical, confirmed in 1/3's mind that she was suffering from severe strain and depression. L/3 told Rowton that he understood from her remarks that she had found the Havana airport, Havana, Cuba and the Cubans in general "detestable". She exclaimed at one point: "Odio a esa isla maldita!" She added that she was on the point of becoming an enemy of Cuba (volverse gusana). In the next breath, however, she stated that she had to return "en pocos días" as soon as treatment had been arranged for her daughter, (suffering from asthma). L/3, pretending to think that she had patched up things with her husband, Enrique, asked whether she had been reconciled and found that she really loved her husband after all. She exclaimed, according to L/3, in a half hysterical voice that she hated her husband and everything her represented.

3. L/3 continued that despite his repeated questions Carmen Lozada refused to give him details of what actually had happened to her. She repeatedly stated that she was under "intense, horrible pressure" that she could not explain. When L/3 commented that L/4 was preparing to return to Havana, Carmen Lozada burst out again with "Qué horrible!" but again did not explain. In view of Carmen Lozada's obvious state of psychological and physical disintegration, LLI/3 told Rowton that he felt it best to terminate the meeting at the first opportunity (about 1630) and leave as gracefully as he could. He added that when he left he looked back to see her standing in a daze for a full five minutes before walking off.

30 Jeruar, 1958

Subject: LIRING/4 Report of letter from Maceiro, Vice Minister of Education.

1. At 1000 on 30 January, 1965, LIRING/4 reported to Forton that she had seen Jorrin the previous afternoon and that he had told her that he had been to her apartment the previous evening but had failed to find her or HallG/3 in. He explained that Dr. Farizelo, who was visiting Mexico City, had asked him to deliver to LIREC/4 as letter from their mutual friend, Dr. Maceira. Jorrin then gave IRING/4 the letter.

2. LIING/4 stated to Rowton that the letter was simply a request for shoes for Maceira's child which could not be obtained in Cuba. ILIRING/4 commented that this was mely another of a series of such requests that Maceira and Figueroa of the Ministry of Education had been making to her since their last visit to kexico. She had in the past ignored the reçuests since she felt she had done enough and could see no useful purpose in running arouni town as a purchasing agent, particularly when there was no guarantee that they would reisburse her.

3. Horton suggested that on this occasion, however, it right prove worth- while, in view of Marinelo's apparently important position in aavana and LIRING/4's forthcoming trip. Ee suggested that LIRING/4 purchase the shoes (about 50 pesos) and attempt to deliver then personally to harinelo; She could then invite hin to lunch or dinner in the hope of assessing his present feelings toward the regize. HIRING/4 recalled that Marinelo had been Rector of the University of Havana and was a member of the old guard communist party. She added that Jorrín had zentioned that Karinelo held Anbassadorial rank and was serving at the present time in some sort of international delegation.

4. LIRING/4 also reported that she rad run into an eld Caban friend, Aralia Arizmendi, on the street, and that the latter had given her her home phone as 23-79-95. LIRING/4 explained that Arizmendi had married a Mexican psychiatrist and left Cuba some years back. As far as she knew Arizmendi was sympathetic with the Castro regine and on more or less friendly teras with LIKING. On this occasica Arizmendi joked with 1/4 about the inefficiency of the LIRING offcials, saying that the only per- son she felt was doing a decent job was Cepeta.

5. LIRING/4 also reported that she had written a snors letter to her negro zedical student friend, Yolanda, and dropped the letter, as requested by Rowton, in the open mail ( to ascertain the time taken to deliverrthe letter to Havana. LIRING/4 gave Yolanda's full name and address as:

1. On 15 April 1968, circa 1410 hours, the audio installation described in reference was deactivated. The SPT-2A was recovered by Walter W. CORNEURY and returned to Station stock. The LP equipment, an SPR-2A and UHER 4000 L, will also be returned to Station stock.

2. Inasmuch as LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 were terminating their "lease" on the target apartment, it was felt the SPT-2A carrier current transmitter would have to be removed because of its shallow concealment. To continue the assessment of target personalities however, we wanted to wait until almost the last minute. The week of 15 April 1968 was selected as an appropriate time by Wallace B. ROWTON, who is in contact with the targets.

3. At about 1300 hours, 15 April 1968, Walter W. CORNBURY and Oliver D. CIROCH entered the LP and were greeted by LIBOSIS who knew we were coming but did not know why. A check of the audio device revealed that LIRING-4 and a young (teenage) male relative were in the target. This was as expected. At 1330 hours, LIRING-4 left the apartment, alone, for a luncheon date with ROWTON. She returned a few minutes later and made the male relative accompany her. (This was obviously at the insistence of ROWTON.) The telephone number of the target apartment was tried a few minutes after their departure and was not answered, again as expected. At 1400 hours a telephone call was received in the LP from the Station as a relay from ROWTON that the targets were safely ensconsed for at least the next hour. (It was known that LIRING-3 was out of the city.) Another telephone call to target with no answer, and CORNBURY entered the target

L/3 told Ecston tat Cliva confiled to his that as had just learned from four Cuatean erades who lived together in an apartment on Calle Lerma that their residence was bein. surveilled by what they felt was the Hano Blanca. Ee ex lained that they had coted several fairly well-dressed zen hanging around the apartment house and had tried to follow one of them but he had run off. This all indicated to them that the surveillance cas not be ing carried the Moto come private group. civa the: stated that they ined that the deputy chief of the lano Blanca cracization Oliverio Castañeda, was currently in Mexico City, and assumed that he had organized the surveillance. Oliva then mentioned that one of the four living at Calle Lerma was the well-known Guerrilla leader who had recently sought sanctuary in the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala City and was granted asylum to Mexico scrough the intervention and influence of Lazaro Cárdenas.

2. In order to ceteraine the exact location of the Lerma apartzent, MilNG/ told Rowten that he offerted to help identify the surveillance by conducting a countersurveillance himself the following evening. He also derred the of his Tacubaya studio, recommending that in any case the four saculd dis- perse at least temorarily.

3. L/3 also reported to kowton that he again met with Cliva at 1015 that same morning and that the latter had taken his to a printing shop on Calzada Tlal pan near Calle José T. Cuéllar, named "Regia", as 1/3 recalled. (Cte Mexico City telephone directory lists "Resca-i-presos y Rayados, Calle J.7. Cuélle 57, tel: 73-05-01). Oliva told L/3 that this shop produced varicus ID papers for them in the past but unfortunately was not able to fabricate a good Mexican ID card because of the unavailability of the specialtype used. L/3 said that he was confident that he could make the reproduction through his seriographic process. In the course of conversatica cliva conficed to 1/3 that the Guatemalan lawyer, Capuano, had provided blank Guatemalan.

Oliva also menticred that FAR was hoping to obtain a lathe to percit the manufacture of weapons locally (in the moutains).

5. Cliva also stated that the principle purpose of the visit of his coarade "Rodolfo" was to obtain funds and to return to Mexico. Cliva added the: in the event 2/3 could make the trip he could also return with Rodolfo to Mexico. In reply to 2/3's query, Oliva stated that the funds codolfo would be given in Guatemala were from various robberies carried out by Fär for the purpose of raising its own funds. Cliva commented that they could sot count off the Cubans or the CPG for financial support when it was needed. He added that the sale of the booklet "Terror in Guatemala" (of wach L/3 bad obtained a copy from Carlos Persoval) had helped to supply some of the money to be used for the trip.

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Contact with kemebers of FAR, Guatemala.

1. At 0945 on 19/3/68 at the hobbins Restaurant, Calle Leibnitz and Belchor Ссаrро, LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that he had again met the FAR mezber whose sketch he had ziven Roxton the previous day and whom he had met thru Carlos Fersaval of 17/3/63. Ee explained that Fersaval had finally contacted him by phone late Sunday afternoon (17/3/63) and introduced him to one of the two Guatemalans who wasted to return clandestinely to their Guatemalan country. 1/3 described this man, who later showed hir/entification papers in the name of Miguel Angel Oliva, aged 33, as short, stocky, with Liack hair trimmed short and rather thick prominent eyebrows. 1/3 estimated his age as 35 and said there was no doubt in his mind that he was a native-born Guate-.

vuis person wore a thin coustache. L/3 then drew nosta a sketch of the person concerned which Rowton passed in to the Statio: the same day.

2. LIANG/3 continued that he conversed with the Guatemalan, Oliva, in the presence of Carlos Fersaval and his wife Teresa Lozada de Fersaval at the Miss restaurant on Reforma for about 45 minutes, taking the line that he was willing to help the cause as he had done in me past, but he wanted to be certain of the exact affiliations and bona fides of the persons with how he was dealing. then this apparently surprised and somewhat shocked Carlos Persaval and Teresa, 1/3 explained that he had had some unpleasant experiences with such persons as Crozco and was aware that many RAR desertors vere circulating around Hexico these days. The Guatemalan, Oliva, however reacted favor bly saying that he understood 1/3's position and cid not blame him. He added that he would furnish proof of his FAR affiliations and indicated that there were two other comrades, one much more important than himself, ho also needed help in returning. L/3 told Roston that he stressed to all pree sent the risks involved in providing false documentation and acting as a guide for them to cross the border illegally and his original commitment to help only two persons. In reply to 1/3's query, the Guatemalan Oliva stated that their destination would de Guatemala City itself and they hoped that 1/3 would be able to accompny then there since they were not familiar with the countryside betweenthe border in the Comitan area and Guatemala City.

3. According to LIKING/3 the Catter insisted that he meet the other, core i
   portant Guatemalan, and be given an opportunity to make carſeful plans be-
   fore attempting the journey to Chiapas and Guatemala City. | Cliva, then made a date with Persaval and 1/3 for the next evening at 2300 at the corner of

San Juan Latran and Madero at which tice he would try to arrange a meeting with his comrade.

4. LIING/3, at his meeting with souton the following morniz(19/3/58) reported that when he arrived at the place designated he found the Guatemalan Cliva waiting with neither of them saw Fersaval. Clive, after await-of-about 45 cinutes, suggested that they give up and go to a cafeteria, Copa de Leche, on an Juan Latrán. L/3 stated to corton that while they were waitin they were joined by another Guatemalan, a young man of about 22 years of ag and rather stout, who accompanied them to the cafeteria. The older Guatemal then showed 1/3 a Guatemalan passport is the name of Miguel Angel Cliva Casteñada which he said was false but which enabled his to travel is kexico. The younger aan sated that he had legal documents but did not volunteer his name to 1/3. In the counseon καν νer cate malan, Cliva, formerly worked in the advertising business in Guatemala City and that the younger man was familiar with electronic equipment and radio communications probleus. The older Guatemalan apologized to 1/3 for not having been able to bring along the other FAR ccarade, to whom be referred as "Rodolfo" and again promised to introduce hint: 1/3 the Colloring evening. He pronised to telephone 1/3 at 1400 the next day to confirm the meeting.

5. LIING/3 then told Foton that the two Guatemalans then escorted his to the Hotel del Valle on Calle Independencia (Corton recalls that Or. Bustamante resided there during his stay in Mexico City several months ago).. 1/3 told corton that he met two other Guatemalars there in the lobby and comment: that they talked r. ther freely in front of hia, discussing at one point even the illegal acquisition of a revolver needed by one f them. In the course o` conversation 1/3 stated that he learned tast César Fontes is nos back in Guatemala and that the FAR is planning an April ofensive. All the Guatema lans expressed concern over the increase in the power of the "Fano Blanca and blamed it for the kidnapping of the Guatemalan Archbishop. They also com. mented that the military-in Guatemala were disenchanted with the "puppet pre sident, Fontenegro, and could be experted to increase the terrorism from the right in order to place Montenegro in an impossible position and eventua ly justify his removal.

6. 1/3 commented to Roston that he noted that at no time did any of the Guate malans sention Cuban aid or assitance. In fact one of them at one point s-id that he had tried unsuccessfully to obtain a visa for travel to Cubasоmе thirty days previously.

Subject: LIRI.G/3 Report of Keeting with Carlos Fersaval.

1. LLAIG/3 reported to Howton at 1115 on 15/3/68 at the restaurant Hiss ca reforma and Calle Mississipi that unfortunately his meeting with the two Guatemalans scheduled for the previous evening at 2230-2300 in Danny's restaurant (Reforma at Ciana Circle) did not come off. He stated that he arrived at the restaurant at 2230 and waited until about 2315 without seeing either Fersaval or being approached by any Guatemalan. He continued that just as he was about to leave, he heard a tap on the window behind hij and turned and saw Teresa Lozada de Fersaval co the street. He wmet out and a vu a car where Carlos Ferseval was waiting. He was then driven to canborn's Angel and remained there with Carlos and Teresa for some thirt mizutes.

2. According to LIRING/3, Carlos Fersaval explained that he had been stood up by the Guatemalars and had been unable to get in touch with them to introduce them to 1/3 as he had hoped. He added that one of the persons XXX had been in Cuernavaca two or three days previously and perhaps had not been able to return in time for the meeting. Fersaval, the appeared to 1/3 to be quite nervous in Sanborn's, suggested that they go elsewhere to continue their discussion and LIRING/3 invited him and Teresa to his Facubaya studio.

3. They then proceeded there to continue the discussion. Feresa excused herself on arrival saying that she was very tired, and promptly fell asleep in one of the bedrooms. Carlos Fersaval then continued talking with 1/3 uctil about C30C. He mentioned that cre of the Guatemalans he hoped to introduce to 1/3 was well-known and important in FAR, while the other(who had documents) was relatively unimportant and could probably get by the police checks witzout as such risk. In reply to L/3's queries, Fersaval stated that both men wanted to travel to Guatemala City and that one (the important one) vould probably be returning to Mexico after a short stay. Persaval revealed that as far as he knew the purpose of their trip was to chtain much-reeced funds to continue their work in Mexico.

4. LIKING/3 told Boston that he again promised to guide the Guatemalans across the border south of San Cristóbal but insisted on meeting then in Mexico City prior to escorting them over the border. Persaval then asked 1/3

c. LIRING-3: From recent activity it appears that the Guatemalan FAR may have renewed its interest in LIRING-3. In late January, an emissary of FAR representatives in the PERUMEN capital traveled to Mexico and contacted the person who had carried to PERUMEN the letter sent by LIRING-3 in the summer of 1967 denouncing Moises CROZCO Leal. The emissary brought the word that the FAR had much appreciated LIRING-3's letter on OROZCO and warned that the FAR organization in Mexico City was infiltrated by a WOFIRM operator. Try as he might, however, LIRING-3 failed, at least by the end of this period, to meet with the FAR men.

2 October, 1967

Subject: SGSIEL Examination of LIRING/3.

1. From about 1330 until 1530 on 29 September, 1967, LIRING/3 was given an SGS IRL examination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse (Tacubaya) with the SGS IRL operator at 0930 that morning and remained with the operator until the examination was completed. He had not given LIRING/3 any previous notice of the nature or extent of the examination, but siaply asked him, on 27 September, to keep the entire day of 29 September free for a lengthy dicussion with Rowton. Zowton introduced the SG-SWIRL operator as señor Albertini, a trusted "sccio", and spent the first hour or so reviewing his relationship with LIRING/3, ostensibly for the veneric via Doutor thon, introducing the anhject of certain doubts that he hak in the past concerning LIRENG/3's reporting, stated that Albertini had a means of checking scientifically the truthfulness of LIRING/3's statements. Rowton explained that he was particularly concerned about the possiblity of LIRICG/3 having doubled back with LERING andmaintaining with them a secret agreement of some sort to report on Rowton and his activities.

2. LIRING/3 wnet into a state of visible shock at this and stated that even the thought of betraying Rowton had never occurred to him at any time. When the SGS IRL operator explained the scientific means he was to use on LIRDIG/3, the latter stated that he could not possibly accept this humiliating means of testing him since it was diazentrically opposed to his principles. He pointed out that he had accepted Powton at his word and he could not see or understand why Rowton could not do the same for his, adding that the whole thing smacked of methods used by CFACT and LIRING. He added that if this meant that he would have to break with Rowton, then regretfully he would have to accept this alternative. He explained that submit-ing to the SGSWIRL examination would inevitably destroy the idealistic and profound relationship which he had previously felt he enjoyed with Rowton.

3. Roston and the SGS IRL operator spent the next two hours calming LIRING/3 down and finally convincing him that he would not be compromising with his deeply-felt principles by taking the test. He at last consented to be questioned on his loyalty to Rowton and insisted that he be asked, "Do you believe in Kowton?"

4. After a brief break for lunch the examination was given inone of the bedrooms aff the apartment while Roxton waited in the living room. LIGING/3

2. 
appeared to be in reasonably good spirits after the test, although he was obviously emotionally strained by the experience. Rowton made a date to see him again that evening at 2100 to talk things over in a clazer atmosphere.

5. At that meeting with LIRING/3 Rowton explained that he had felt it necessary to ascertain as objectively as possibly the extent of LIRIING/3'8 loyalty to him and he was happy to have scientific proof that LIRING/3 had not berayed him to the LIRING'S. LIRING/3 stated that after it was all over he felt Letter and admitted that he agreed with Rowton on the necessity for such an examination, humiliating as it might at first have comed to be. Be confond that any Hammonell (Pahntentions and omniactand that he had made in the past, were due to his intense desire to produce for Rowton, since he still felt very sensitive about having to accept money from Roston without being able to render commensurate services. He stressed, however, that at no time had he ever been disloyal to Rowton or done anything against Howton's interest, as señor Albertini could prove with the results of the SGSWIRL. LIRING/3 promised in the future to follow Rowton's direction scrupulously and assured Rowton that he no longer feit under any compulsion to exaggerate or fabricate anything to impress Roxton.

6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGSWIRL examination disappoin-ting in its limited coverage, but it must be realized that LIRING/3's initial reaction was entirely negative and at one point he treatened to break off completely with Rowton because of the insult to his "dignity". Although the SGSWIRL operator felt that from a professional standpoint it would be better to administer the examination at another time when LIEING/3 was less emotionally upset, Rowton asked both him and LIRING/3 to go thru with it on the spot, feeling that psychologically it was essential to make LIRING/3 submit, even for a limited test. Rowten also feels that the test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over LIRING/3 in the future, when a second one can be more painlessly administered, in a calmer atmosphere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether LIRING/3 had been an LIRING double agent or betrayed Rowton in any way.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES
MOOMIFUK

1. Attached herewith is the SGSWIRL report (Idens u/s/c) on LIRING/3.

2. Please note that the EGSWIRL interviewer has made the point that the principal misfortune in this interview probably was that LIRING/3 was not tested on the fabrication of contacts with the IDEM D's, which was thought to be the most probable area of deception.

3. In view of LIRING/3's threat to quit working for ROWTON, we would be interested in hearing of any repurcussions or change in attitude that may have resulted from LIRING/3's having taken the test. We also are interested in the Station's comments and recommendations as to the continued use of LIRING-3, bearing in mind ROWTON's recent report of LIKING Suspicions that L-3 may be working for HOFIRM.

SUBJECT: LIRING-1 (IDEN A) RED #46719

Subject was interviewed and tested with SGSWIRL on 19 September 1967 in a Mexico City safe site. The interview was reported by Raymond A. FRAZIER.

The interview was conducted in Spanish by the examiner, Wallace A. ROWTON. Subject's original accent was stressed during substantially all of the interview except for the testing period.

Subject has not previously been tested, and has had no contact with any WOFIRM representatives other than ROWTON.

Subject is a married male Mexican citizen, an IDEN B by profession. Prior to recruitment his apparent political sentiments were somewhere in the far left, but he was not believed to be significantly involved in intelligence activities or organized political activities. He was recruited by ROWTON under the cover of a IDEN C. Subject has since his recruitment had contact with IDEN D elements and with IDEN E elements in his efforts to insert himself and ROWTON into the desired position. The initial goal of this operation was to monitor narc traffic and pick up whatever intelligence information might be incidentally encountered. As subject was and is, in his own idiosyncratic way, a communist sympathizer, ROWTON has not indicated any anti-communist, anti-IDEN K, or anti-revolutionary aims.

Subject was known to have had and concealed information on numerous occasions, and it was presumed that considerably more lies were not yet known to WOFIRM. On this basis, SGSWIRL coverage was to have covered numerous issues, centered on other intelligence involvement, fabrication of contacts with significant IDEN D and IDEN K figures, and revision of his association with ROWTON. The issue of revelation of association with ROWTON was rather complex in that ROWTON never revealed his true name, nationality, or interests to subject, and also be instructed subject to reveal certain ostensible facts to various specific individuals.

The examiner was presented to subject as an associate of ROWTON of Italian extraction.

## PROCEDURE

Subject first refused to take the test, basically on the grounds that in his estimation his relationship with ROWTON, as well as his whole way of life, were at variance with any such procedure. In the threat of four tears that this was being discussed, Subject also decided to quit working for ROWTON.

Eventually, over a specific matter of hurt pride, Subject agreed, or rather demanded, to be tested on "two questions--whether (he) was betraying ROWTON to IDEN E intelligence and whether (he) trusted ROWTON," following which he would break off contact with ROWTON. Under these circumstances, the best course would be to follow this lead and attempt no more than a clarification of Subject's relationship with IDEN E intelligence. The examiner was not optimistic about the possibility of getting a valid test under these circumstances, but after talking with Subject for a time it was possible to develop what the examiner considers a reasonable and technically acceptable test covering unreported involvement with any intelligence service.

The above procedure might be visualized more accurately if it is mentioned that once having met with Subject, ROWTON and the examiner had almost no time together without Subject being present, and it was not possible for them to converse in any language other than Spanish without damaging their cover.

## RESULTS

Subject has no connections or commitments unknown to ROWTON with any government or intelligence service. He has no involvement with the IDEN E's that he wishes to conceal from ROWTON, and he has no dealings with the IDEN E's which are contrary to what he believes to be ROWTON's interests.

Concerning revelation to the IDEN E's of Subject's association with ROWTON, the issue itself was, not unexpectedly, a cloudy case. In brief, Subject stated that he could not really recall the exact extent to which he might have revealed the fact that he was backed by a IDEN C or that the IDEN C's name was (ROWTON's alias). Subject himself suggested that he be asked if he was "informing the IDEN E's of ROWTON's movements," Subject's way of expressing the idea of "reporting on" ROWTON. The examiner used this question, and Subject appears to have been truthful in his negative answer to this question.

IRD #9919

NOTE

1.  By the end of the interview, ROWTON &.d Subject and made an appointment for a meeting that same evening, indicating that is is quite unlikely that Subject will break contact with ACWTON.

2.  It was not really possible for the examiner to determine the extent to which Subject believed the story of the IDEN C and the Italian JURAL examiner. The examiner feels that there were no real flaws in the maintenance of this cover and that the cover's only real weakness is its inherently shaky plausibility. Subject appeared to accept the alias used by the examiner and even made passing references to Italy: whether this was done because he believed what he was told or because he just thought it was the most courteous way to handle the situation is not known. In his next several "sort" references to the injustice of ACWTON and for the examiner demanding to see a SCOWIRL as him whom he did not even know for sure who ROWTON was. On at least one occasion he wondered that for all he knew ROWTON might even be working for WOFIRM. This reference did not seem strained, although it is conceivable that its purpose was provocation; ROWTON has told the examiner that Subject recently hypothesized out loud that ROWTON might be a Soviet.

3.  The principal misfortune of this interview is probably that Subject was not tested ce fabrication of contacts with LDEN D'a. This was thought to be the most probable area of extensive deception. It should be pointed out, however, that the Station already knows that Subject has fabricated such contacts, and the most likely contribution of SUSWIRL would have been merely a further accumulation of examples of this same basic vice. It might also be pointed out that Subject's "reporting" to Case has dealt almost exclusively with his own activity, hence his fabrication has been more an irritation than a threat.

SUBJECT : LIRDG-3 (IDEN A) RD 68919

Subject was interviewed and tested with SGSWIRL on 29 September 1967 in a Mexico City safe site. The interview was requested by Aymond A. FRADYER.

The interview was conducted in Spanish by the examiner. Wallace A. ROWTON, Subject's principal agent, was present during substantially all of the interview except for the testing period.

Subject has not been contacted and has had no contact with any WOFIRM representatives other than ROWTON.

Subject is a married male Mexican citizen, an IDEN B by profession. Prior to recruitment his apparent political sentiments were somewhere in the far left, but he was not believed to be significantly involved in intelligence activities or organized political activities.

Subject was known to have lied and concealed information on numerous occasions, and it was presumed that considerably more lies were not yet known to WCFIRM. On this basis, SGSWIRL coverage was to have covered numerous issues, centered on other intelligence involvement, intricacies of contacts with significant IDEN D and IDEN E figures, and revelation of his association with ROWTON. The issue of revelation of association with ROWTON was rather complex in that ROWTON never revealed his true name, nationality, or interests to Subject, and also be instructed Subject to reveal certain ostensible facts to various specific individuals.

The examiner was presented to Subject as an associate of ROWTON of Italian extraction.

Something above an identity card. ROHTON suggests that two or three identifications be provided of such general terms that substitution vos'd be fairly easy. that he needs for each document are six photographs full face and full profile, both left and right, along with a complete physical description. The subject should be 45-50 years old and have a Mexican or Latin appearance.

1. Forwarded attached are three reports dated 23, 28 and 30 October written by Wallace B. ROWTON on his contacts with Rodolfo REYES-Cortes, Carmen MOLINA de CAPRASCO and Carmen LOZADA de Ramirez.

LIRING-4 to a party given by Carmen MOLINA on 27 October, passing himself as a wealthy Greek client of LIRING-3 who had called at the latter's house to pay for a painting he had ordered but had been invited by LIRING-4 to come to the party. As previously agreed with the Station, ROWTON directed his main attention to REYES. The latter has resided in Havana since 1960 when he founded the Cuban Ballet Folklorico. Until recently REYES has received the monthly salary of one thousand pesos from the Cuban government, and, according to LIRING-3 is well acquainted with political and government personalities in Cuba. As pointed out in Reference, ROWTON found REYES to be apolitical, a superficial sympathizer of the Cuban revolution and a great admirer of American choreography (he told ROWTON he would very much like to go to New York to see some of the shows there.) REYES complained about the relatively low salary he is currently receiving from the Mexico City Belles Artes for organizing a Cuban Ballet Folklorico show to be held in Mexico City next December. He readily agreed to ROWTON'S offer

to be his patron (to "help him out financially") if this could be done
on a very discreet basis. He said he hoped to put on another Cuban
show in Chile, before returning to his family in Havana. LIFEAT
coverage of LIRING-3's apartment for 26 October showed, incident-
ally, that REYES maintains close enough relations with Silvia
DURAN (of Lee Harvey OSWALD fame) to be invited by her to her
house for lunch.

2. Carmen MOLINA de CARRASCO is the leftist wife of a
   prominent local neurosurgeon, Juan CARRASCO with whom she spent
   some years in Cuba. Both are Mexican citizens. According to what
   she previously told LIRING-3, Carmen MOLINA helped gather some of
   the information used to defend both Victor RICO-Galan and the
   ROSENBERGS. With the help of Alicia ECHEVERRIA and the latter's
   uncle (who is the current Mexican Minister of Interior) Carmen
   obtained a prominent position on the Mexican Olympic Committee
   in the publication department. She is a close friend of Carmen
   LOZADA who is planning to divorce her husband, Enrique RAMIREZ, a
   rabid pro-CASTRO Mexican chemical engineer who is still in Cuba.
   Carmen LOZADA's father, Armenegildo LOZADA, a noted Mexican
   physician is married to a pro-CASTRO Cuban. According to informa-
   tion made available to LIFTER-1, in early 1967 both he (Armenegildo)
   and his second and present wife are hard core Marxists. This
   vile, pra maria victoria de la cruz, a Cuban, still according to
   LIFTER-1, is a personal friend of several Cuban leaders including
   the CASTRO brothers. Husband and wife maintain a close relation-
   ship with the local Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ-Armas.
   Carmen LOZADA apparently also started out as a hard line Marxist.
   Information dated 1961 from RNLABILE indicates that she was !
   active in Communist organizational work at UNAM and participated
   in Cuban led activities directed against ex-Peruvian President
   PRADO. Although she is still clearly a leftist, Carmen may not be
   quite as red now. She told ROWTON, for example, that she felt
   nothing but disgust for her fanatically pro-CASTRO husband and
   had strong resentment toward her step-mother. Per LIENVOY, July
   1961, Carmen was in contact with Teresa PROENZA when the latter
   was at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

3. At a private lunch with Carmen MOLINA, 28 October,
   ROWTON explained that he was a Greek leftist (although not a KKE
   member) involved in lucrative international business. He said
   that because of the current situation in Greece, it was difficult
   for him to operate in Mexico as openly as he would like. He
   could thus use MOLINA's help in obtaining certain types of
   information and making discreet contacts with Mexican government
   and business circles. MOLINA agreed to do what she could. She
   stated that she was not a member of any Mexican or any other
   Communist organization, but merely a leftist sympathizer. She
   also stated that she currently maintains little or no contact with
   the Cuban Embassy. LIOSION-1, to whom a photograph of MOLINA,
   REYES and LOZADA (copy of which is forwarded attached) was shown
   stated he had never seen these three persons enter the Cuban
   Embassy.

4. Following the developments described above, Station
   plans to:

a. Continue to develop REYES to the point where,
per Reference, he may be recruited by ROWTON either under
false flag as a Greek leftist or in alias as a WOFIRM
member to become a reporting source in Havana. Primary
motivation in REYES' case would almost certainly be
financial.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 182

SECRET

EMMA-33442

b. To continue social development of MOLINA as access agent to Carmen LOZADA (the two women are planning to live together) and a possible entree to the Mexican Olympic Committee and foreign olympic delegation.

c. To attempt operational development of Carmen LOZADA directly via ROHTON or indirectly via LIRING-3 in the hope that we can play on her "disgust" for the fanaticism of her husband and her dislike of her mother-in-law to elicit information on the activities of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and its personnel, and, hopefully to attempt her recruitment.

5. Station would welcome addressees' comments on the above. Headquarters attention is attracted to KOWTON's report of 30 October which quotes REYES' statements to the effect that soze members of the Mexican colony in Havana believe that LIRING-3 may be working for WOFIRM (or for the CASTRO government.)

28 October, 1967

Subject: Wallace 3. Roston Contact with Rodolfo keyes Cortes(Subsct).

1. Rowton met Subject ca the evening of 27 Cctober, 1957, at a small party at the home of Carmen Molina de Carrasco, Calle Amsterdan 252/6. The only other persons at the party besides the son and daughter of Carmen Molina were Carmen Lozada and Enrique Canuias, the latter two of whom had returned from Havana some 30 days previously. All the above are Fexicans who have spent several years in Havana and are social acquaintances of LIRING/3 and LIRING/4.

2. RCATON crashed the party in the company of LIRISG/4 according to a previously agreed plan. LISING/3 arrived at about 2030 alone, explaising that he had had to leave LIRING/4 at home to wait for an important client who was making a payment on one of Lizi.G/3's paintings that he had recently purchased. LIRING/3 was to add that LIRING/4 would try to persuade this client to accompany her to the party so that de could meet everyone, and have a drink. LIKING/3 told howton he was certain that Carzen Kolina would have no hesitation in inviting Rowton to stay once he got into the apartment.

3. Rowton and LIRING/4 arrived about 2130 and found the party in full swing with LIRING/3 and Eduardo Canudas struglling to get the phonograph operating (they eventually borrowed another and played several Cuban revolutionary records.). Rowton was introduced as Sr. Marris, Greek businessman and long-standing client, and felt at the end he was able to convince all present that he actually was not from CLADY (although most apparently had that impression at the outset). Eowton managed to toss out a few phrases of mussian at the right time in the direction of Carmen Kolina to impress her (fortunately her Russian is weaker even than Eowton') Korton spoke some English with as good an accent as he could manage. Carmen Molina volunteered to his privately that she had a great many "progressive" friends in the U.S. Rowton was able to insert several comments about the current political situation in Greece that was forcing him into a virtually clandestine exiestence in Mexico, as well as elsewhere. Everyone appeared to sympathize with Routen and ceased asking any personal questions.

4. Rodolfo Reyes Cortes, apparently the guest of hozor, arrived at about 2300, apologizing for being late and explaining that he had to attend a memorial service (un acto) for Che Guevara. De refusedell offers of liquor


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 184

2. 
insisting on a Coca Cola. He appeared genuinely happy to meet Rowton and explained in quite serious tones that he was engaged in the training of a Kexican ballet group under the auspices of Bellas Artes to present a performance of the Folklorico Cubano in the near future. He added that he had been the founder of the Folklorico Cubano in the early 60's in Havana and had a wife (ballerina) and young daughter in Havana whom he was anxious to return to.

5. Since nonton felt that Rodolfo was at the moment the best target for assessment he invited him to join him in visiting the Señorial night-club to see the Greek dances put on by a group of Greek musicians. Rodolfo accepted eagerly and they both left the party at about 0030. Roston had perviously obtained the office telephone of Carmen Helina (34-60-32,ext 38) at the office of the Olvatic Committee where she wasi working and had promised to take her to lunch the following day. Horton had also gotten in a few private comments (i.e. ccmpliments) to Carmen Lozada so that he could follow up at a later date if this was considered desirable. He found Carmen Lozada in excellent spirits and at times definitely provocative, despite her current marital situation (she had that same day notiféei her husband, Enrique Ramirez, a civil engineer working in Havana, that she had begun divorce prodeedings).

5. When Roston and Rodolfo Reyes arrived at the Señorial, they were refused entrance into the main room since Rodolfo was not wearing a tie and jacket. Fortunately however, the Greek musicians, in their native costumes, were relaxing in a corner of the entrance lobby and Roston was able to introduce Rodolfo Reyes to them and speak enough Greek to convince Reyes that he knew them well ani was himself a Grrek. The musicians, who probably aa-sumed Kowton was a Greek-American, did not speak enough Spanish to talk directly to Rodolfo. They invited Rowton and Rodolfo to return on 31 Cet when they expected fewer people in the audience and when they could show Rodolfo some of the most popular Greek ċances.

7. Rowton then invited Rodolfo Reyes to the Kinneret Restaurant for a late supper (no food was served at the Carmen Kolina party) and he was able to continue his conversation with him there. Rodolfo revealed that he plans to visit Chile in mid-December, 1967, to organize a Folklorico Cubano group there, and then return to Havana. He said Rowton could con-tact him daily at the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico from 1000 until about $300 and gave the telephone as 21-04-18 or 21-16-09. Ee appeared from his conversation to be a n admirer of the Cuban revolution and Castro although


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 185

3. 
at no time did he exress and strong anti-CLADY sentiments. Ee complained at one point of the meagee compensation he received for his services at the Folklorico in Mexico City and said that he had just about enough money to live on end help support his parents (he remarked that his fasily comes from San Cristóbal in Chiapas). Rowton, explaining that he had brought a number of LEEING/3's paintings to help hin with his living expenses as well as because he liked the style, stated that he had once aspired to be an artist but had drifted off into business and somewhat regretted this abandonment of art, despite his lucrative dealings in international trade. He took this opening to offer to help Rodolfo fizancially from time to time, but on a very confidential basis. Rodolfo reacted spontaneously with great expressions of gratitude, assuring Rowton that no one would learn of how- ton's interest in him and his fanily. Rowton made no commitment but indi- Cateù của consider helming Rodolfo with his living expenses while he was still in Mexico.

8. Rodolfo Reyes is obviously dedicated to his art and appeared to Boston to be a seriousminded KEY choreographer. He showed a certain effezinite manner in his gestures and remarks (speaking only in Spanish ) character- istic of many persons in his profession. He accepted an invitation to meet again with Roston at 2300 at the Kinneret Restaurant on 31 October, 1967, so that Rowton and he could revisit the Señorial night-club to see the Greek musicians perform.

1.  LIRING/3 reported to Rowton 23/10/67 that Carmen Lozada, neuro- logist, and Canudas (fou), chemical engineer, visited his home evening 21 October in company Carmen Carasco. LIGING/3 and 14 state they knew both Carmen Lozada and Canudas in Bavana since 1961 (both are Mexicans) under contact with GCC and were surprised to learn from them that they will not return to Cuba because of disillusionment.

2.  Carmen Lozada stated that she will divorce her husband. Enrique Ramirez, a civil engineer, still in Bavana and resume work in Foly-tecnico in Kexico City.

3.  Canudas informed 1/3 that mutual friend Rodolfo Reyes of the baltet folklorico, such to everyone's surprise, will return to Cuba Lext month. LIRING/3 procised Kowton to get in touch wita reyes to determine moti-vation for return. L/ suraises that real reason may be Reyes disgust with family in Mexico and desire to be reunited with his Cuban wife who, according L/3, is talented and very attractive.

4.  Carmen Lozada informed L/3 that her parents who faxilxxvery close to Enbassador Xxxxx Hernandez Armas (who frequent guest at their home) will be dis- appointed to learn of her decision divorce her husband and remain in Mexico.

30 October, 1967

Subject: Report of LIKING/3 Suspect Affiliation with WOFIAM.

1. LIRING/3 reported to howton at 0900 on 30 October, 1967, that he had finally manged to have a private talk with Rodolfo Reyes Cortes, his Mexican chereographer friend, on the afternoon of 27 October, 1967; and that, in the course of conversation, Rodolfo Reyes had revealed to LIRING/3 in confidence that the reason why the LIRINGS had assumed a rather cool attitude toward LIRING/3 over the past year. Rodolfo Reyes explained that the last time he was in Havana he had heard rumors, among his friends in the Mexican colony, that LIRING/3 was working "either for CFIRM or the Cubans". Rodolfo went on to say that the orıgın of this rumor, as far as he could ascertain, was the fact that LIRING/3 had made two trips into Havana for no known specificreason and at his own expense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that he himself did not believe the rumors or, at least, did not care whether they were true or not, commented to LIRING/3 that other members of LIRING/3's profession were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of their group and were always quick to draw their own conclusions.

2. LIRING/3 commented to Rowton that, although this news had shaken hi. and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared particularly what the LIRINGs thought of them, since their own conscience was clear: LIRING/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop his commercial activity in Chiapas ( especially since acdolfo Reyes' home is by coincidence located in San Cristóbal) so that word would gradually. filter back to the Lallics that he actually did have financial resources outside his art production. LIRING/3 continued that obviously the LIRINGS did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all contact with him as well as LIRING/4. He concluded that since the LIRINGS had certain suspicions, they naturally warned all his friends and former contacts (including, of course, arnol Rodriquez) to avoid close contact with him until their doubts could be resolved.

3. In reply to howton's query LIRING/3 stated that Rodolfo Reyes and Carmen Molina (separately) had commented to him that they were favorably impresseu by Rowton and did not voice any suspicion of Rowton's bona fides (as a Greek leftist businessman). Carmen Molina, in fact, had gone so far as to show some irritation that LIRING/3 had not introduced her to Rowton pre-viously since she was anxious to develop some sort of lucrative business

dealing with him. Carmen Molina commented to LIRING/3 that she felt
sure she could help Roston in his business and political problems and
at the same time make a little much-needed money for her own living
expenses.

4. LIRING/3 continued that he had been maintaining discreet personal
   contact with Carmen Lozada over the week-end (he commented that LIRING/4
   has already shown some signs of jealousy and therefore he ad to be careful
   not to give her cause to distrust him). LIRIKG/3 stated that Carmen Lo-
   zada had told him that her father, a well-to-do Mexican doctor residing
   in Coyacań, had remarried tand that her step-mother was a Cuban sicentist
   who had lived many years in Mexico. She added that both her father and
   step-mother were on excellent social terns with Ambassador Hernández Armas.
   She revealed that she nad already notified her husband, Enrique Ramirez,
   that she intended to divorce him, and she expected a storm of protest both
   from him (in Havana) and her father and step-mother, both of whoa were
   "puritanic" despite their "progressive" convictions. She added that she
   expected Enrique Ramirez to rush over from Havana as soon as he received
   her letter and to appeal to her father and step-mother to save his mar-
   riage. She, however, insisted to LIRING/3 that she had made up her mind
   that she would go through with the divorce. She added that for this reason
   she did not wish to live with her father and had decidei to stay with
   her friend, Carmen Molina, until the divorce papers were through and the
   store had blown over. She added that she did not particularly like being
   a house-guest in the smali aprtment of Carmen Molina, but at the moment
   she had no choice.

Attachment A to E4A-12989 dated 6 September 1967

## AUDIO

1. Special COU operations No. 1 and No. 2 have functioned satisfactorily with no calls for assistance.

2. LIKING-3/LISO: A 7MH-4000L has been installed for this operation in lieu of a Levare. There was a slight problem at first when the LP operator recorded too loud and distorted the tape. The Wild Hesco batteries and the quality has greatly improved by getting off the AC line. COENBUET has come to the conclusion that Mexico City does not have a good earth ground. Consequently, great adjustments must be made with any equipment that needs an earth ground.

3. DISPERSE: A separate report is being prepared on this operation. To date, we are not too happy with the results. There is an intermittent buzz which we cannot identify and the present switching arrangement makes it hard to follow Subject from room to room. Here details will be included in a separate dispatch.

4. LISAX PAX: We now feel that this operation is beginning to shape up, thanks to the expertise of Peter J. DETAP. Inasmuch as CSTRJP will provide a technical report, and presumably is still working on some of the problems, the details will not be reported here. It is too soon to say, but we hope to be able to have the 17 keep-alive some defective C7L-1's out and replace them with operating units whenever there is a failure. A problem might be having to adjust each unit on the target line. Time will tell.

5. Plans for LISAK PAK are to activate the CCT of LISAK PAK/BAKER early in September using LICAIGE as the LP. When we have reliable switching on LISANPAK/ DC, this, too, will be piped to LIOBICE via CCT from LISAK.

6. There were a few other miscellaneous AUDIO chores. Three duplicate tapes had to be made for the COB, three Levare tape recorders had to be cleaned and repaired, and one 7MH 4000-L was cleaned and repaired.

1. Forwarded under separate cover are six reports dated 31 July, 5, 11, 14 and 17 (two reports) August 1967 concerning the LIRING-3 Operation prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON.

2. The first three reports 31 July, 5 and 11 August deal with the recent Moises CROZCO Leal "affair" (see reference) and it's aftermath. The 17 August also deals with this subject. LIRING-3's conversation with Mercedes *PEREIRA (report dated 14 August 1967) was reported in MEXICO CITY 2476.

3. ROWTON's report dated 17 August 1967 is of some interest.

A. The departure of the secretary LIEING-4 previously filled in for reopens the possibility that LIRING-4 may, again, work at LIRING. LIRING-4, in fact, recently received a necklace from this secretary (a rather unexpected gift at this juncture).

B. The report indicates that LIRING personnel have doubts about some of LIRING-3's activities (this is not too surprising).

Subject:

1.  LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1100 on 17 August, 1957, that he had had a pleasant chat with the previous day in the latter's office. Among other things revealed that Araceli and her husband had been recalled to Havana unexpectedly and would probably be leaving for-good in about 7-10 days. did not provide LIRING/3 with any explanation, but L/3 surmises that the recent inspection uncovered the fact that Araceli is a chronic complainer and performs relatively little work, and her husband is virtually superfluous at Cubana de Aviación since he never has been able to take over the management from Rojas as originally planned. LIRING/3 commented that this might be the much-hoped-for chance for LIRING/4 to resume work in LIPEN/9's office. Rowton asked L/3 to encourage L/4 to accept the offer if it should be made. He added that the last time he talked with L/4 she appeared a little reluctant to get involved again, explaining that she commented when discussing the shortage of funds (2-3,000 dollars) that she was glad that she wasn't still working and hence not subject to any investigation. L/3 promised to put pressure on L/4 to accept the job. He noted with satisfaction that L/4 had recently received a message from Araceli Cepero that she had a gift (necklace) for her. L/3 added that L/4 has not rushed over as yet to pick up the gift, but feels it better to wait until Eati has departed in the hope that Araceli might talk more freely at that time.

2.  LIRING/3 also reported that commented in the course of conversation that his colleagues did not believe that Rico Galán had broken down and talked to the Mexican police, despite the letter (furnished by L/3) to the contrary. L/3 suggested that they check out the letter with Elena Carro, since he understood that she was the one who hand-carried it to the Gobernación. L/3 commented with some bitterness that it seems that every time he tries to help the revolution by passing on bits of information (Julian Lopez case in particular) it turns out prejudicial to him in the eyes of the superiors of. At this smiled and asked L/3 to have patience and try to understand their point of view. He reiterated that they had doubts but felt sure it would be straightened out eventually.

3.  At the end of the meeting L/3 promised Rowton that he would try his best to "lie low" during Rowton's absence. He agreed with Rowton that

it would be a good idea to visit San Cristóbal to show some sign of life at the "Floridian" factory and to reassure the land-lady that he is still interested in using the house but has had unexpectedly delayed in obtaining the license. I/3 also agreed to go to Havana in the event he received an invitation and could not stall long enough to consult with Howton after the latter's return to Mexico City. He stated that he assumed that the invitation would come from the "Opeas de las Americas" and might concern some sort of art exhibition with fixed rates.

4. Howton gave I/3 his New York City I.C. Fox (in alias) and requested I/3 to drop him a line between 25-31 August, when he expected to be passing through New York from Montreal enroute to Europe. I/3 stressed again that he hoped to cash in on some venture in Venezuela, especially in the eyes of the Cubans, since it was a bona fide effort that could easily be checked out with favorable results.

# 17 August, 1957

Subject: Review of LIRING Traffic Relating to LIRING/3 and LIRING/4 for the period 2-14 August, 1957.

1. A review of the LIRING intercepts for the period 2-14 August, 1967, reveals confirmation of the following points proviously reported to Routon:

   (a) Commercial (cover) activities of LIRING/3. SIM-28(2.2) confirms that srita Guadalupe Vasquez, the friend of Sergio Valdez, was working on the license (as of 2 August) for the importation of the plastic flowers from Guatemala for L/3. She states that she is going to court with the petition "right now". In another intercept on 13 august Sergio Valdez tells L/3 that he and Alejandra (Urbina Torres) will make up their legal and personal agreements the following week (with regard to "Colorlux", the glass factory located at Plaza Nirvaille). They expected to assmeble the samples (for Venezuela) the following day.

   (b) LIRING/3 conversations with his Honduran friend, René Ochoa, in Havana. SIM-41 (7.7) reveals that Ochoa is anxious to talk seriously with L/3 and wants to get to Mexico City soonest. He states that the only problem is the visa and promises to send L/3 data so that L/3 can attempt to expedite a Mexican visa.

   (c) LIRING/4's social contacts with the LIRING personnel. With regard to L/4's general feeling toward the LIRING establishment, L/3 tells Rojas (of the Cultrual office) that L/4 visits LIRING "only occasionally", and adds that "those people were very hard to get along with and she no longer has anything to do there... Only goes by once in a while to say hello."

   (d) LIRING/3's contacts with Ernesto Capuano during the week of 7 August, although the substance of the conversations with him is not confirmed. SIM-1(5.0) indicates that Sergio Valdez assisted L/3 in his attempts to locate Capuano and make the first appointment.

   (e) LIRING/3's contact with Cesar Tejeda Fonseca and sra. Merceded Fereira on 10 and 13 Agust,1957.

2. The review likewise reveals that the following information not previously known by Routon or passed to his by LIRING/3:.

(a) In conrol the antion of ba articipation of both Cergio Valdes and Rafi Horenc in L/3's oprati nal as well as ccmmercial efforts. L/3 has told Lorton repeatedly that Vallez and Horenc are aware of 1/3's relptionship in the plastic flower Susiness with cer Greeks but that they are act witting of louton's alias on of the true nature of their relation ship. IFA Intercepts, however, reveal that L/3 keeps Sergio Valden informed of is in with actor (and it must be assumed of he cerere content of their conversations. Curing this period, com da pred to as a "Corba" and several times as "Perice", whereas periodically he was Faffrred to staply as "that perora". L/3 has tatre to Corton that Sergio Valdez his Croch at a cal. L/3 believes that his Crote contacts are purely commercial.

(b) 1/3's relationship and renforous' with Cilvia Durán and Parte Wigisser. In . Silvia Durán invites 1/3 to her home between 1530 or 1500 or 5/4/67 when she will be free. Che calle and talked to L/3 for the first time on 10/8/89. 1/4 says that she has head of Cilvia Durán. L/3 and Silvia replies that she hopes they will meet someday soon. SM-40(5.5) indicates that 1/3 is using Lorton as an excuse to stay at the Tacudaya apt (probably during a toyot with either of the above women). He saw Lowton from 1700-1800 on 5/3/67 but called 1/4 at about 1915 to say the the "matter with Martin is not finished yet", and later to add that "the thing is fragging out".

(c) 1/3's telephone contact with a certain Electa on 2/3/67 who tells him that the Swiss artist, Rodolfo Reisler, is visiting from Cuba, 1/3 comments that he has known Reisler since 1961 - since 1/3 first went to Cuba.

15 August, 1737

Subject: LIRING/3 Meeting with Mercedes Pereira.

1. At his meeting with Routen at 1100 on 14 August, 1937, LIRING/3 reported that he had learned from Ernesto Capuano that Sra Mercedes Pereira, his Spanish revolutionary friend, was living at Diagonal San Antonio 4, in apartment 6. (According to L/3, his interest in Pereira was revived by a comment made to him by Loisés Orozco Leal on 31 July,1937, to the effect that Mercedes Pereira was in Mexico).

2. LIRING/3 continued that upon learning her address he called on Sra. Pereira unannounced at 1030 on 13 August with LIRING/4 and fortunately found her in with her 17-year-old son, Armando. He found the apartment almost completely unfurnished, except for a table and several chairs and a minimum of bedroom furniture. According to L/3, Sra. Pereira explained that she and her son had just returned to Mexico and were organizing their household on their very limited resources. She stated that her son had found work in a factory and that she hoped to locate a job as soon as her Mexican immigrant papers came through.

3. She and her son welcomed LIRING/3 and L/4 after so many years, but Sra. Pereira confessed later in the conversation that she was expecting L/3 to visit her since she had already received word from Ernesto Capuano. She then recounted to L/3 and L/4 the vicissitudes and turmoil of her life since she had last seen them in Havana (in 1954). She stated that her very confused citizenship status had continued to plague her in Havana and when she finally decided to leave in order to settle the inheritance left by her/deceased husband in Spain, she had great difficulty in leaving Cuba. She explained that many obstacles were put in her way, despite all the work she had done for the revolution, and she was forced to leave in effect as a "gusantita". She said that her mother and sister, Sofia, were still in Havana, and added that her sister is still working at the Czech Embassy. She also stated parenthetically that her sister, Sofia, was hoping to be transferred to the Czech Embassy in Mexico City in the near future, where she had worked prior to going to Havana.

4. Sra. Pereira stated that she was greatly disillusioned with the Cubans and felt that the Tricontinental had done more harm than good by trampling its intention of helping all Latin American revolutions. She commented that the situation in Guatemala, which she had recently visited as a tourist with Spanish documents, was very bad for the revolutionaries. She explained that not only were there many factions in the movement -

FA, Jan Cisa, the Frimero de Mayo, the "Gravos" and other splinter groups - but there were recently, during the land six months many deserters filtering into Mexico and that 1/3 would have to more with extreme caution in his contacts with the revolutionaries. 1/3 told "caten that he felt this an opportune opening to relate his story of Moisés Crozco Leal and he did so briefly. Sra. Pereira wanted that she first met Crozco in Havana when she was much involved there with Guatemalan revolutionaries. She added that she was favorably impressed with Crozco and was surprised to learn he had deserted from FAR. She added that there was another FAR deserted in Mexico City even more important than Crozco, by the name of "El Gallo" or "El Gafito", whose true name she did not know. Salvador Guitiérrez Alvarado

5. According to 1/3, sra. Pereira cced that she thought 2 had acted properly with regard to Crozco ad agreed with him that he should attempt to retain friendly contact with Crozco until he recieved a definitive reply from FAR as to the best course of action to take with him. She offerred to introduce 1/3 to several Guatemalans she knew well in Mexico City - not directly involved in the revelation but useful contacts in any case. In reply to 1/3's query, she stated that Ernesto Capuano was a reliable and intelligent person, but so exposed in Mexico City that he could not operate as freely as he would like. The stressed to 1/3 that Capuano was closely watched and could be a contact that right conceivably compromise 1/3 in his future travels to Guatemala. The stated that she herself was being extremely cautious because of her past history in Guatemala as well as Havana, and had even gone to the length of paying a considerable sum to have her file removed from Gobernación, so that there would not be a trace of her travels to Cuba and Guatemala. She explained that after leaving Havana, she and her son went to Spain and managed to collect a small inheritance (about 7,000 pesos in value) and at the same time took out Spanish papers and was issued a Spanish passport, as a refugee. LI-RMG/3 explained to Rowton that sra. Fereira had been born in Spain, but moved to Mexico many years ago, married a Guatemalan doctor, accompanied him to Guatemala where he worked under the Arbenz regime, sought refuge in Mexico with him after the overthrow of the government. After her husband (either legal or common-law) died she left for Havana, in 1962, as 1/3 recalls, with her son, Ársando, who had been born in Guatemala City about 1950. 1/3 continued that she became closely connected with the Gua-calan revolutionaries in Havana and represented Guatemala at the Tri-continental. 1/3 stated that sra. Fereira is a well educated woman of about

Forty-six years of age, and that her son, aged about 17, is a very husky teen-ager who was trained in guerrilla warfare by the Cubans. 2/3 also recalled that Mrs. Pereira's mother's name is Isabela, and will probably resettle in Spain, once she leaves Cuba with her other daughter, Sofia Pereira.

6. AMMUG/3 stated that he hoped to see sra. Pereira again within the XX week since he was quite certain that she could put him in touch with the FUR people in Mexico City and possibly act as a liaison herself in the future.

11 August, 1967

Subject: LENING/3 Report of Contact with Moisés Crozco Leal.

1. At 1100 on 11 August, 1967, at the safehouse Rowton learned from LENING/3 that Moisés Crozco Leal telephoned him the previous afternoon to thank him for the letter and the interest he has shown in him. L/3 stated that he told Crozco that his main concern was what if anything the Mexicans had asked him about L/3 and whether he had been forced to reveal any of L/3's business (in Guatemala). According to L/3, Crozco assured him that, altho the Mexican police had asked him "many and repeated questions" about his travels, he revealed nothing about L/3. One of the questions asked repeatedly by the Mexicans was what he knew about the husband of a certain Aura Marina. Crozco claimed that he "knew nothing of this person and so replied in the negative to the police". Crozco continued that he could not let L/3 know where he was at the moment but would get in touch with him in a short time, as soon as the heat was off, through his mother. According to L/3, Crozco's mother's home has been searched several times since Crozco's release on 4 August, 1967.

2. LENING/3 then explained that after he learned of Crozco's arrest and release (through Ernesto Cayetano) he felt it urgent that he communicate with Crozco to determine what Crozco had revealed to the Mexican police and how he was treated. He therefore sent a telegram to Crozco addressed to Crozco's mother at her home address (Calle Tenis 403, Col. Country Club on 6 August, simply asking Crozco in double talk to get in touch with him. When nothing happened, L/3 continued, he sent LENING/4 around to Crozco's mother's home about 1030 on 9 August with a short note, the text of which is as follows:

Valentín:

We have learned of late about your mishap. We want to give you the help we can, since, apart from everything, we understand the human problems (involved).

We want to see you to find out what we can do for you, but we'll leave it to your discretion as to the contact.

1.  LIRIG/3 reported to Wowox at 1700 on 4/2/67 that he informed by Sergio Valdez that morning that Alberto Domingo of Ciempre was taking plane to Havana that afternoon. L/3 stated that he took this opportunity to write a hasty note to Arrol Rodriguez explaining recent developments in Moisés Crozco Leal affair and asking Arrol to expedite new contact for 1/3 with FAR either in Havana or Guatemala City. L/3 explained to Howton that in order to put heat on Arrol and FAR he wrote that if he not invited to Havana within next two weeks he will definitely be in Guatemala City staying at hotel Florida from 20-24 August and that new FAR liaison should identify himself as "José Luis". He added that Arrol should cable him using code "La medicina está en mal estado" in event FAR wished him keep out of Crozco affair.

2.  L/3 stated that Sergio Valdez personally asked Alberto Domingo deliver sealed envelope containing this letter to Armol Rodriguez. Valdez feels that Domingo will not read letter, although it mentions him as person who (unwittingly) originally referred Crozco to Valdezxzzi LIRING/3/

3.  L/3 also reported that he spoke with Ernesto Capoano by phone and has appointment to meet with him at 1000 on 7/8/67. Capoano cautioned 1/3/8s by give some indication of nature of business. 2/3 stated it concerned "the medicine" and it was then that kỵ Capoano gave his appointment.

21 July, 1967

Subject: Wallace B. Roxton Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Roxton met with LIRING/3 at 1700 on 31 July, 1967, at the safehouse. L/3 reported at once that he had moved his family into the safehouse and that L/4 and their child were out at the moment so that he and Roxton could talk privately. He explained that things were moving very rapidly and that Kiosés Crozco Leal was in fact staying at his apartment (Tacuba-ya) in preparation for the trip they were to take to Tapachula. He stated that he had met with Crozco as planned at 2200 on 29 July and, after a lengthy talk, Crozco had asked to be put up in L/3's apartment for the night, since it was late and it would be better in view of the trip that they planned to take together. L/3 commented that Crozco appeared quite nervous and was particularly concerned about answering the door in the event someone knocked while L/3 was away. It was agreed that he would answer the door only in the event that there were three knocks, indicating that the person was LIRING/3 himself. According to L/3 Crozco stated that he had at all costs to get to Tapachula within the next two or three days to meet FAR contacts that were expecting him there. He expressed fear of traveling by plane or even train and welcomed the suggestion of L/3 that the latter's friend Raúl Moreno drive him and L/3 to Tapachula in Moreno's car. L/3 commented to Roxton that he was amazed at the knowledge Crozco had concerning him and his activities, including the dates of his (L/3's) trips to Guatemala and Cuba.

2. Roxton then realizing that L/3 had probably walked into a dangerous trap, queried him very carefully concerning the origin of his contact with Crozco. Roxton explained that he was certain that L/3's story of the trip to Tapachula and the meeting with the Guatemalan woman there was untrue and that he assumed that L/3 had a good reason for distorting the truth. Roxton continued that he had come to the conclusion that L/3 had had a domestic crisis again and had decided to disappear for a few days and had told his wife that he had to go out of town on business for Roxton. He was therefore forced to lie to Roxton also for fear that Roxton might disclose the truth to L/4. Roxton stressed that it was essential that he know the true facts surrounding the first contact with Crozco, since, as L/3 would see later, it might be a matter of life and death for him.

3. LIRING/3 then confessed that he had not actually made the trip but not for the reason Roxton supposed. The real reason he explained was that when Crozco contacted him he saw Sergio Valdez shortly thereafter and the latter to his amazement commented:" I have been contacted. Have you been


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 213

2. 
contacted also?" According to 1/3, he askel Valdez how it was possible that he knew of any new contact that he had, and Talčez replied: "I'z in this thing also." LING/3 continued that this statement of Valdez zo surprised and disturbed him and he decided to investigate to what extent Valdez was invoided in the whole affair of the Guatemalans. In the absence of howton he had no resources other than his own genuity, He decided to disappear so that he could investigate more securely and he informed 1/4 that he had to make a trip to Chiapas. He then telephoned Valdez several tizes, disquising his voice, and pretending to be "Valentin" in the age of eliciting seme sign of recognition from Valdez. 1/3 continued that this, however, did not work and he failed to prove any connection between Taldez and Crozco. 2/3 explained then that he did not want to reveal this to low- ton, first because he was afraid that Rowten would consider him stupić or added that he hoped Rowton could understand the terrible pressure he was living under from all sides, with people contacting him, surveilling is movements, controling bin. In fact he felt trapped by unknown force. Ee stated that for instance he was certain that he entrance of Sergio Valdez and Raúl Koreno on the scene was not coincidental but was part of scze larger picture that he could not understand. Ze added that this tize be was determined to find out how Valdez aas linked with Crozco.

4. Sorton then asked 1/3 what he knew about Crozce. 2/3 replied that he knew only what Crozco himself had revealed to him, viz., that his mother was living in Mexico City, that his father had texx never been progressive and had in fast been arrested by the government (resumably Arbenz) tut had not been harmed since he had been so honesty and his réputation was above reproach. Orozco also informed 2/3 that he had been to Cuba several times and recently was in touch with Kontes in Guatemala and up to recent- ly had been doing propaganda work for the FAR.

5. Roxton then stated that he had been doing his best to collect as such information on Crozco as possible and that he was far from happy with what _ he had zanaged to uncover to date. He explained that he had verified the address given to him by L/3 (Calle Tenis 33/5) but discovered that it was the home of Crozco's mother and that Crozco was not actually residing there. He added that he had also learned that Crozco's father was protab- ly unstable mentally and that his brother worked in Folitica, and this màng aight account for. Valdez' connection wtih hin (Valdez' working for Rafaga) Rowton then stated that he had a report that he had not as yet been able


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 214

to check out to the effect that Crozco bad been in Guatemala in May
1967 assigned to some guerrilla activity in the Conan area but had un-
expectedly Zipappoured and returned to Vezice, probably Loccuse he was
afraid of capture. L/3 exclianed in evident surprise: "Then he's a de-
serter!" Lorton agreed that this might be the case and added that this
would explain why he wanted to hide out in 1/3's apartment. 1/3 then ag-
reed that this grobally was the case and exclaimed again:" Put then it's
very dangerous for hix ze to be sheltering him!" Roxton agreed but urged
1/3 to keep calm and exploit the opportunity to learn foon, Crozco the
true facts of his present relationship to ZAR and how he came to use 2/3
unwittingly as a refuge. 3/3 asked Rowton how he could confront Crozce
with his suspicions and get him to reveal what wowter wanted to know. Bow-
ton then suggested that 1/3 drop casually the name of Ernesto Cancere.
saying that se had to see this lawyer the next day on some business. How-!
ton explained that he thought this would force Crozco to talk since he
would naturally be fearful of 1/3's revealing his whereboats to Capcezo.
L/3 replied that he would willingly do this but unfortunately he did zot
know Caposno. He sullenly thought, however, of a ruse that might work. He
could get in touch immediately with Jacobo Rodriguez Fadilla, who would
certainly know of Capoano, and ret as much information on Caponano from
Jacobo before springing the name on Crozco. Rowton agreed and stressed that
it was essential that 1/3 get as much of the true story from Grozco that
nigat as possible. He urged 1/3 to pose as a friend and offer to put
Crozco in scce other safe place, explaining that his continued presence
would jeopardize his own position vis-a-vis the FAR.

6. During the meeting 1/3 positiviely identified the photograph (Fassport)
   that Roxton showed him of Koisés Crozco Leal. 2/3 commented that Crozco
   now was wearing glasses and a moustache and had shaved his head, giving
   himself the appearnace of a person of at least 45 years of age (his trre
   age is 37, according to his own statement). 1/3 recalled that Crozco in-
   formed hia in passing that Leonardo Castillo of FAR had been killed in
   action recently.

7. In view of the urgency of the developemtns Rowton arranged another
   meeting with 1/3 that same evening (31 July) at midnight at Sanborns
   Reforma.

4. AFTERNOON 22 AUG 67 LIPEPEL-2 REPORTED FOLLOWING STORY

HE RECEIVED FROM ERNESTO CAPUANO DEL VECCHIO ON 19 AUG:

FOR PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, MEXICAN PAINTER CARLOS (JURADO)

DELWAR HAS ATTEMPTED MAKE CONTACT IN MEXICO WITH TOP LEADERS FUERZAS
ARMADAS REBELDES (FAR) TO OFFER SALE OF MEDICINE AND ARMS. HE
FIRST MADE CONTACT WITH CARLOS BAVAPRETE (KNOWN TO ADDRESSEES) AND
EXPLAINED HE HAS GREEK FRIEND WHO SELLS ARMS ALL OVER WORLD. GREEK
SECAVE INTERESTED IN SELLING AR'S TO FAR AND ASKED JURADO TO MAKE
NECESSARY. CONTACTS. NAVARRETE FOUND JUPADO TOO EAGER AND TOO
INSISTENT ON MAKING CONTACT WITH FAR AND INMEDIATELY BEGAN TO SUSPECT
HIM AS CIA OR MEXICAN SECURITY SERVICE PROVOCATION. HAVARRETE
DID NOT HELP HIM AND JURADO SOMEHOW RADE CONTACT WITH MOISES (OROZCO)
LEAL. CAPUANO DOES NOT KNOW WHAT RELATIONSHIP OROZCO HAD WITH
JURADO EXCEPT THAT LATTER OFFERED HIM ARMS, MEDICINE AND MONEY (300
DOLLARS THE LATTER OF WHICH CROZCO DID NOT ACCEPT. RECENTLY,
JURADO CALLED CAPUANO AND ASKED TO MEET WITH HIM. SHOWED. CAPUANO
LETTER WRITTEN BY OROZCO WHICH CLEARLY INDICATED CROZCO WAS TRAITOR


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 218

PAGE 2 MEXICO CITY 2564 SECRET

TO "CAUSE" (SENT ADDRESSEES IN HMA 32**?** AND 32807. AFTER SPEAKING

SECURITY-PROVOCATION BASED ON FOLLOWING POINTS:

A. JURADO TOO EAGER AND INSISTENT ON CONTACTING FAR LEADERS.

B. JURADO, WHO-SUPPOSEDLY-IN-ARMS BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY, OFFERED OROZCO MONEY FOR FAR (322 DOLLARS). ACTUAL ARMS SELLER WOULD MAKE NO SUCH OFFER.

C. JURADO WANTED TO MAKE FAR LEADERS AWARE OF CROZCO'S TRAITOROUS ACT AND ARMS SELLERS USUALLY TAKE NO INTEREST IN INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF GUERRILLA GROUPS THEY SELL TO.

D. CAPUANO DOES NOT BELIEVE "GREEK" EXISTS AND JURADO USED THIS AS "COVER" TO PENETRATE FAR MOVEMENT.

2. CAPUANO ASKED LIPEBEL-2 TO AID IN INVESTIGATION OF JURADO. FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO INTERROGATE OROZCO ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH JURADO TO DETERMINE HOW FAR JURADO HAS PENETRATED THE FAR.

CAPUANO SAID THERE IS NO PLAN TO DO JURADO BODILY HARM FOR THE PRESENT, BUT HE WILL BE IGNORED BY GUAT EXILES.

3. LIREBEL-2 SAID THAT IN CONNECTION WITH JURADO, A GUAT WHO HAS LIVED IN CUBA FOR SEVERAL YEARS RECENTLY ARRIVED MEXICO.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 219

PAGE 3 MEXICO CITY 2554 SECRET

WITH WIFE. THIS PERSON, ARMANDO PEREIFA, MET JURADO IN CUBA (NO DATE) AND WAS TOLD BY CUBANS THAT JURADO ACTS VERY SUSPICIOUSLY AND IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

4. ON 23 AUG LIREBEL-2, CAPUANO, JOSE LUIS BALCARCEL AND LUIS CASTILLO RALDA WILL HOLD MEETING TO DISCUSS GUAT COMMUNIST EXILE LEADERSHIP IN MEXICO AND JURADO CASE.

5. IT OBVIOUS FROM ABOVE THAT CAPUANO DOES NOT HAVE FULL STORY JURADO'S ACTIVITIES AND HAS MANY OF HIS "FACTS" BADLY MIXED UP. FOR ONE THING CAPUANO MADE NO MENTION OF JURADO'S TRIPS TO GUATEMALA WHERE HE ACTUALLY CONTACTED FAR NOR OF HIS MEETINGS WITH "GARCIA" IN MEXICO CITY. IF JURADO'S STATEMENTS TO WALLACE S. ROWTON CAN BE BELIEVED, IT WAS FAR WHO ASKED HIM ABOUT POSSI- BILITY TRANSPORT TO BORDER AREA WEAPONS PURCHASED BY FAR PROCURE- MENT MECHANISM SOME OF WHICH WAS IN TEXAS. IT WAS ALSO FAR THAT ASKED FOR MEDICINES. DO NOT BELIEVE JURADO OFFERED FAR MONEY, ON CONTRARY HE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR PAYMENT OF MEDICINE AND OTHER

ITEMS "SOLD" FAR. EITHER CAPUANO MISUNDERSTOOD JURADO OR LATTER DID NOT REPORT HIS CONVERSATION WITH CAPUANO ACCURATELY TO ROWTON. JURADO WAS INSTRUCTED TO POINT OUT TO CAPUANO HE TOOK DIM VIEW OF BEING USED BY OROZCO TO DOUBLE CROSS FAR EMPHASIZING THAT, HAD HE


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 220

PAGE 4

HAD ARMS TO GIVE OROZCO (WHICH HE DOD NOT) HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
PECEIVED HIS FAYMENT IN LEAD SINCE OR0208 COMPLETELY BROKE. THUS
IN CROZCO "AFFAIR" IT WAS FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL SECURITY ANGLES WHICH
OSTENSIBLY BOTHERED JURADO AND NOT HIS INTEREST IN FAR
INTER POLITICS, HE FURTHERMORE LOANED OPOZCO 322 PESOS
AND NOI THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS

6. WHATEVER HOLES AND CONFUSION EXIST IN CAPUANO'S STATEMENTS
   RE JUPADO'S ACTIVITIES HE NEVERTHELESS HAS GUESSED BASIC TRUTH
   JURADO MAY HAVE EXCEEDED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND NOT REPORTED HIS
   CONVERSATIONS WITH FAR AND CAPUANO ACCURATELY TO ROWTON MAY BE
   CAUSE OF CURRENT TROUBLE. ROWION SEVERAL TIMES CAUGHT HIM IN
   FABRICATIONS WITH HELP EXTENSIVE STATION MONITORING HIS ACTIVITIES.
   IT HAS ALSO BEEN DIFFICULT TO PREVENT HIM FROM BEING OVERACTIVE
   IN HIS DESIRE PRODUCE VALID FAR CONTACT. STATION HAS ALREADY TOLD
   LIREBEL-2 THAT IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH JURADO, WILL WAIT FOR
   PESULTS FAS 23 AUG MEETING MEXICO CITY CITED ABOVE BEFORE EX-
   PLORING POSSIBILITY CAREFULLY FEED INFO VIA LIRESEL-2 TO PROTECT
   JURADO. BELIEVE WARNING JURADO VIA LETTER SENT BY ROWTON OR
   OTHER MEANS WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AT THIS TIME.

La Habana, 27 de Julio de 1967.

Estimado Cerliche:

Hoy hace más de un mes que recibi tu carte, per les conversaciones telefónicas sostenicas habrás pedido comprender que la dorora en contestarte se debe, ne precisamente a apetis de ni perte, sino falta de canales-acocuados para tal fin.

Esta to la envió por la gentileza de un compañerodo trabajo cuya eppesa va hada oss, dicho sea de pase je ne le conezce a ella, por lo tante es realmente una casualidad que te pueda enviar ne- ticias;pere oten ne quería comerar más y he aquí estas líneas.

Creo que entiendo perfectamente tu situación, pues es necesario abrirse pase con los propios nodies, denestrar con hechos;es- to puede que al principie te huels a conseje, pere realmente no le es pues precisamente la idea la he tonsão de ti y shore le scopte cono posición e actitud ante les heuhes.Ers ni desee pederte enviar neti- cias concretas y ampliss esta vez, pere justamente tengo las mismas 41- ficultades que tu enumeras, a pesar de la cercanía fisica. Entregué ti carta al compañere ne ne fue posible hablar con él sebre el partica- lar pues el día que fui llegaron muchas visitas, antes de que 61 llega- ra hablé alge con la señora, concretamente me dije que habían recibi- do tus noticias, que también te habían contestade;que te iben a invitar los organismes correspondientes pere que elles aún no tenían noticiss concretss;despues cene te dije llegaron las visitas y no pude sscar ninguna conclusión;estino que a a estas alturas ya debes tener noticias; posteriormente ne he pedido ocuparne de elle principalmente per lies de ni parte, fundszentalmente por cuestiones de trabaje.

Ahora bien, to prenete hacer nuevas gestiones pues en estos días tonge un respire, aunque las gentes per aquí en estes diss están bastante oculdes con la cantidad de actividades y de aconteci- zientes especialmente de este mes, pere ya verenes.

Creo que no es necesarios que te aclare, que en general, tendrás que acostumbrarte a estes problemas, pues las cousas veces le parecen a use a faciles y desde luego no lo sen mas que en aperiensis,es necesario comprender a los stres, waxime en esta cosas, un pece pensar cone ellos;alguna vez en muestras discusiones me has señalado come jo justificaba las cosas siempre con la frase hasta cierto punto tal o tales cosas con inevitables"; creo que osa no es una frase sin sentido no es una cómoda salida, es para mi una conclusión de las realidades que me han tocado vivir aqui,hey la sige repitiendo y aún tiene más sentide. Le anterior, por supueste, no significa que a que sigara Japoran pa desarrollen normalmente, todo lo contrario, hay que provocar le ruptura, cázo?, justamente "aprendiendo a rascarse con las propias uñas", domostrando con hechos y un pecs "ne esperar nses de nadie".

Difás per fin cayó en el plane del consejo, te ratifice ne se trata de ese, tu misne le has dishe eres lo suficientemente grande para comprender les responsabilides que adquieres, per lo tanto kuelgen los consejos, sobretode les que se dan a centrel rezete. simplemente trate de inbuierte de uns idea que ya tienes.Ke parece que hay seriedad y responsabilidad en le que haces era de esperar de ti,ze complace que nicas todo lo que implies per ambas partes, es un camino suzamente peligrose, só que le sabes mejor que yo, pero Carlos siempre tu eres demasiado bueno y de la bendad a la ingenuliss me hay ais que un pasite, este alge de le cual tu ne eres consciente, on estas coses es de vital inpertencia comprender e profundidad esto.Nadie trabaja e lucha, buscando aquelle en le cuel ne exista peligro, per le menes entre nosotros, nadie le tiene micie a los cuatre metres de dierra, pero el aliciente o la nete ne e. 1 peligre ni la morte, realmente con ese ne se hace nada, simplexen-es dejar un nombre para uns Fábrica, en el mejor de les cases, se trate de alge may distinte.We hablas de une cesa nermal y luersti-

vo, esto es bueno a condición de que se comprenda que ese constitu-
ye el aspecto externo de la cuestión, es decir la forma, pero lo im-
portante es lo interno el contenido lo esencial; no se conoce la ca-
sa por la fachada, ésta la mayoría de las veces nos engaña. A qué to-
do esto?; bueno, en primer lugar es la opinión de un amigo que algu-
nas cuestiones las conoce un poco mejor que tu,además conociéndote
tengo necesidad de referirme a esto y en segundo lugar porque nece-
sito de ti, de tu situación de tu comprensión, porque también yo he
gozado mi capacidad de espera y realmente en estos momentos cuen-
to conmigo mismo y contigo, no hace falta explicarte porque pues
nuestra situación es similar,por lo tanto tus asuntos y actividades
me interesan sobremanera por las cuestiones apuntadas anteriormente.

Ahora tus noticias son fundamentales para mi, sobre todo
dame detalles, quiere hacer las cosas sabiendo y conociendo lo que
voy a hacer, tengo prisa por hacer algo pero no por los posibles 4
metros de tierra, no lo excluyo, pero tampoco les busco especialmen-
te. Por fin he resuelto lo que me ataba a este gran país, comprende
que aún puedo hacer mucho aquí, pero es infinitamente pequeño com-
parado con lo que tengo que hacer fuera de aquí; sabes bien que no
sou capaz de emborronar tantas cuartillas simplemente por llenarlas
se trata de un planteamiento serio.

Espero que la Cichayila C cuando se traduce del inglés
al chino suena como CH o al revés) ya este bien, esas son las con-
secuencias de ser su propio médico (libretorr), pero de todas mane-
ras nos alegraremos mucho de que haya pedido salir de las garras de
todos los CLCGes. Carlicha necesitaría que en la próxima oportunidad
me consiguieras unos encerios (Zapatos) para la Cati, si se da cuen-
ta de esta solicitud me asesina, pero ya cargo con el pedido, son el
numero 6 1/2 a 7,-

espero tus noticias, saludos a Ciha y (Chichay-).

Pericon Co ahi Salto y las repeticionesfiso

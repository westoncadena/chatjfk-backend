SPECIFIC Arthur G. VAIVADA

Action Requested: None

1.  During his recent visit to Headquarters, Subject was asked by one of the Staff members if he would be interested in, and available for, recruitment approaches in various Latin American countries. Since Subject has a fine record in CP penetration work (i.e., his outstanding job in handling HUKAROID-3 operation in Costa Rica and his efforts in the CP pene-tration program in Cuba), it is believed that he would be an effective recruiter of possible CP defectors.

2.  Subject stated that he was keenly interested in, and would like to engage in, such operations and would welcome the opportunity of being asked to hit a well-chosen target in any Spanish-speaking Latin American country.

3.  The foregoing discussion with Subject was informal and without commitment on either side. However, the Station is being alerted to the possibility that Subject may be requested to perform such approaches at such time then worthwhile recruitment in-place CP targets are developed, or otherwise arise in other countries. Nevertheless, any such action origi-nating at Headquarters or at any other Station, will of course be subject to Station’s consideration and approval beforehand, depending on his availability in reference to his work in Project AMPHODARCH, etc.

FROM: Chief, WHD

SUBJECT:
*   GENERAL - Operational
*   SPECIFIC Proposed assignment of Arthur C. VAIVADA (P)

REF: HMM-5825

ACTION REQUIRED: Station comments and/or concurrence

1.  Subject is identified in reference which also gives his personal data and is forwarded in a separate pouch. Paragraph 4 of that dispatch outlines the cover activities of Subject for the period 1949 to the present, during which he has been actually employed by KUBARK, first as a contract agent then, since May 1967, as a career agent. He currently receives a salary approximately equivalent to that of a GS-11.

2.  Subject's current, extended tour with the Havana station comes to an end in May 1958; due to his operational experience and performance with KUBARK in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Havana, Subject appears to be a good prospect as a replacement for Floyd PONTARY in CP operations.

3.  Originally scheduled to be used by KUBARK in Panama, Subject was instead assigned to Costa Rica in 1948 under the HUMANOID project. While the operational files of this project have not yet been reviewed by this desk, entries in his personal file show that while in Costa Rica he handled a successful high level penetration of the local party. At the end of 1953, after a period of training at Headquarters, he was assigned to PBSUCCESS where he apparently also performed creditably. In July 1954 he was re-assigned to the Havana station as the principal agent of project AMPHODARCH which involves the recruitment and handling of CF penetrations in that country. The AMPHODARCH and Subject's personal files have been reviewed by this desk, together with the training and the assessments of the case officers for whom he has worked, the files show that Subject is eminently qualified as a recruiter and agent handler in CP operations. The records show that Subject possesses a great deal of integrity, resourcefulness and intelligence: he was highly rated both by Headquarters training officers and throughout his operational work in the field. He is particularly evaluated highly as to judgment and common sense.

4.  Should his assignment to Mexico Station be agreed upon, cover possibilities can be considered in the fields of photography and athletic training which are among Subject's specialties. He lists himself as a "pistol expert" and a clarification of this term will be requested if, in the Station's opinion, it may enlarge cover possibilities, perhaps under LIMERKY. Subject's wife is still a Costa Rican citizen at present, while his two children are U.S. citizens.

5.  Station's comments on this proposed assignment and possible cover suggestions will be welcome.

Dear Mr. Noemayr:

Your Cover

1. Cover has been contrived for you with two notional organizations, Public Surveys Institute and Betwins Travel Folders.

2. Public Surveya Institute is a notional organization which 10 ostensibly engaged in conducting all types of polls to determine public reactions on matters of interest to its many clients. This organization is located at Suite 532 Fidelity Union Life Building, 1511 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texse, telephone: Riverside 1-3674. The Institute is directed by Albert E. Johnson, a fictitious individual..

3. The above address is in actuality that of a telephone enswering service where ali nommal calls of inquiry are handled by umsitting personnel during the course of their regular duties. However, any call which requires special attention is referred to a cleared and witting individuel who has contact with headquarters. This person is adequately prepared to acknowledge your relationship with your cover firm and alsoO answer any inquiries concerning you or your cover organization.

4. In addition to the above arrangement, you also have a contract with another potional firm to submit photographs and reports which are to be utilised in the preparation of travel brochures. This firm is Betwins Travel Folders which is located at Room 2101, 50 East 42nd Street, Few York, New York, Telephone: Murray Hill 7-4473. Betwins is directed by Charles H. Betwin, a fictitious individual, and is engaged in the preparation of material for travel folders, brochures, package tours, etc.

8. Your cover story for having been engaged by the Public Surveys Institute is as follows:

During a visit to the United States in May 1957, you became acquainted with Albert E. Johnson, the Director of Public Surveys Institute. Johnson indicated that he was interested in engaging the services of several people to organize and conduct polls in various Latin American areas.

Since you were already located in Cuba and had a knowledge of the language and customs, he expressed an interest in employing you in Cuba. As you felt this type of work would not conflict with your photographic efforts, you accepted the position effective May 1, 1957, in order to have an extra source of income.

Early in 1958, Johnson advised you that he had acquired several promising accounts who were interested in Mexico and he desired to transfer you to Mexico City since you had both experience and the necessary language qualification. You readily agreed to the transfer and planned to leave for Mexico during the latter part of May after a short vacation in the United States.

9. Your cover story for having been engaged by Betwins Travel Folders is as follows:

While visiting in the United States during April 1958 prior to your departure for Mexico, you became acquainted with Charles H. Betwin through Albert Johnson in New York. Betwin had seen some of your published work and expressed an interest in engaging your services on a part-time basis in Mexico. Since it meant an additional source of income as well as an opportunity to utilize your photographic talents, you readily accepted his offer. You were to photograph various places which were of interest to Betwin's clients and also forward information relating to prices, possible package tours, historical points of interest, etc.

Documentation

10. Соггевpondence reflecting your progress or difficulties encountered should be carried on between you and your cover firms. Buch correspondence should be at intervals which would make your association with your cover fires appear to be the normal relationship of exployer and employee.

### Financial Arrangements

11. It is understood that there actually will be no disbursement of funds for salary or other purposes to you through your cover firm, and therefore, arrangements for salary payments are a matter of concern between you and your division case officer. However, precautions must be taken to insure that the arrangements made will not conflict with your cover story.

### Taxes

12. Your income tax returns will be filed with the Internal Revenue Tax Unit stationed at headquarters in accordance with Agency Fil 20-660-4.

### Restrictions

13. Should you at any time feel the necessity for a modification of this cover arrangement, or supplementing the cover outside of the present arrangement, or if any problems arise affecting your cover, direct a routine commamication to your cover firms outlining the nee or situation and concurrently notify your case officer of the conditions so that he my check with headquarters. Eubsequently, you will receive advice from your cover concerns as would be normal and also be provided with official compatible instructions from your case officer.

14. With regard to any persons desiring to apply for a position with either cover firm, you are instructed to state that to the best of your knowledge and belief, the firms are adequately staffed. However, in order the the matter may be treated casually, the inquirer may be told to submit his application to the New York or Texas address, which ever applies, where it will receive due consideration.

15. You understand that these cover facilities have been established through cleared cooperative individuals who are witting, but not actually a part of the Agency. These persons know that you are actually an employee of the Agency and, as such, an extremely high standard of conduct will be expected of you.

2.  The above provision was inadvertently omitted from Subject's contract by the Area Desk, and since the Station notified Subject he was entitled to this allowance, it would be appreciated if this matter be corrected and the contract amended accordingly.

(5) Outside interests, hobbies, etc.: Athletics in general, outdoor life, photography, writing, jungle lore and chess.

(6) Objective personality evaluation: Subject is an astute, experienced and highly competent career agent. He possesses an attitude and a personality which are quite suitable for prolonged existence as a deep-cover agent. His personality is well suited for the many agent handling and management responsibilities that he will have in Mexico City.

(7) Agent's personal financial status: Solvent. He depends entirely on his salary.

(8) Previous foreign residence: Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Cuba since 1940. Military service in the Far East from 1944-45.

(9) Area experience: Area experience as reflected in the foregoing information is extensive.

(10) Language qualifications: Subject has fluent Spanish and English.

C. Security Considerations

(1) Period of employment with CIA: June 1949 - present.

(2) Frequency of visits to CIA installations: Not applicable, since CIA contacts made in safehouses.

(3) Extent of knowledge of others of subject's CIA affiliations: His wife is aware that subject is engaged in intelligence activities, however, not necessarily for CIA. No other non-agency personnel are believed to be aware of subject's CIA status.

(4) Past intelligence connections: With U.S. Army and Air Force as indicated above.

(5) Use of CIA as credit reference: None

(6) Future plans for agent: Contemplate continuation in non-official cover status upon completion of current assignment.

(7) Emergency contact:
Mrs. Lester E. Crosier, mother
1745 S. 26th St.
Omaha, 5, Neb.

(8) Personal insurance held and beneficiaries: None, except as provided for in his contract. His wife is his beneficiary.

(9) Incidents involving security in NOHEAIR's past employment with this Agency:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

While there is no reason to believe that NORMAYE has been exposed or compromised during his years of operating in Costa Rica, Guatemala or Cuba for CIA, the following incidents involving his security are set forth for your information:

a. NORAYE was forced to leave Guatemala prior to his scheduled departure when a Costa Rican source informed me that she had heard from high-level party sources that a "U.S. agent, specialist in Communist matters, had departed San Jose for Guatemala." This vague reference unfortunately coincided with subject's arrival in Guatemala.

b. In 1953 when subject was leaving Costa Rica, he made two cold approaches, one to a woman communist who was a leader in the Union de Mujeres. As subject left her home, the lady went immediately to Party headquarters and reported the incident. However, she was unable to describe NORAYE and so confused the approach story that it was useless to the Party and absolutely nothing ever came of the incident.

c. While in Cuba, NORAYE was working with a municipal committee youth communist who was a translator and did a story for NOMURA in Spanish. They met in each other's homes and NORAYE gave the communist his business card (PSI). Sometime later, the Cuban military intelligence officer (SIM) picked up the communist and searched his premises. Among other things, they found NORAYE's business card. When queried about this, the communist simply told the officials he did translating for NORAYE. Nothing came of this incident and NORAYE could detect no surveillance of his person or his premises.

d. While the Cuban police will probably have NORAYE's name registered as having visited the Sierra Maestra region, the publication of his photographs and perhaps an article at a later date, should cover subject as a writer thereby minimising any security hazard in this connection.

B. Operational Information

(1) Type of operation: FI. Subject will be an outside case officer for several station operations directed at the Mexican Communist and Marxist parties.

(2) Location: Mexico City and Guadalajara.

(3) Degree of mobility desired: Subject will spend most of his time in Mexico City but he should be free to travel to Guadalajara and other towns in Mexico.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 29

(4) Special groups to be contacted: While subject will be concerned principally with the local Communist party, it is not necessary for him to have personal access to any special group.

(5) Approximate annual income to be attributed to cover: $10,000 (including allowances).

(6) Hours which must be devoted to operational duties: Subject should be able to devote at least 80% of his time to operational activity. His proposed cover will allow him a maximum of flexibility in arranging his cover and operational activity.

(7) Physical security requirements: No problems anticipated in this respect.

(8) Communications: Subject will utilize station communications facilities and will have regular contact with station personnel.

(9) Cover suggestions: In view of subject's previous journalistic experience, listed below, it is believed that it would be most appropriate for him to utilize cover connected with journalism. Probably the most advantageous arrangement would be for subject to become affiliated with one or two relatively small U.S. newspapers who do not currently have representatives in Mexico City. His contributions to such news media should be in the field of feature and human-interest stories, rather than of current events. His salary could, and probably should, be based on a stringer or piecemeal basis, rather than having a fixed income. Since subject is also a competent and experienced photographer, he could be expected to make photographic contributions to the newspapers or magazines he represents.

In addition to the above arrangements, it is suggested further that the notional cover (Public Surveys Institute, General Polling Service, Dallas, Texas) previously utilized by subject be continued. Subject maintains that he has developed a very sound and detailed cover based on this notional arrangement and that it would be very logical for him to use it in Mexico. Also, this additional cover arrangement would give subject another means of income together with added social flexibility and geographic mobility.

(10) Previous journalistic and writing experience:

HOFMAYR's formal journalistic training consists of a two-year correspondence course in fiction writing with the Palmer Institute of Authorship.

HOEMAIR has had three short stories published: "Old Saber Nose" in *Boys' Life*, September 1956; "The Golden Liscio," in


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

Boys Life, June 1958, and "Palo e 100 Brezas," in Folia,
& Rovane magazine, on 9 September 1957. HOEMAYR has done quite
a bit of photographic work. While working as a photographer
and setting up a small studio in Sen doro, Costa 1cm, in 1952,
he did case contract work for the Costa Rican Ministry of
Agriculture. They were so pleased with his work that they hired
him to eat up their photographic laboratory in the Ministry.
this period he had more photographs published, mostly portrait
work. Within the last month, HOEMAYR has had one photograph of
Fidel CASTRO published under his by-line, in the New York Mirror
and four similiar photographs have appeared in the New York Times.
He expects that several more of his photographs on
his revelationaries will be published, if the news value of the
movement continues.

HOEMAYR has several personal friends in the newspaper and
Journalistic fields. Among them are: Francis Smith, Fiction
Editor of Boys Life; G. Cordon Teway, Fiction Instructor, Palmer
Institute of Authorship, Hollywood, California; CPO Francis
Williams, technical writer, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio;
Andrew St. George, freelance writer and photographer who also
works for Time-Life; Charles Schuman, staff writer and cameraman
for UPI; and Arthur Gregor, scientific writer, MIT and Nuclear
Metals, Inc., Boston, Mass (married to his wife's sister).

Prevailing geographic conditions and obsticles encountered:

The area in which Mr. Crozier undertook his mission is the Sierra
Maestra mountains located in the Criente Province, Cuba, where the Caban
rebel leader, Fidel Castro has been able to hide-cut and the efforts
of the Cuban Aray to exterminate him for over a year. The mountainous
area is extremely rough and wild terrain, primarily thickly
vegetated with jungle growth. It is sparsly populated, and the only means
of access are foot paths and mountain trails. The approaches
to the area are heavily patroled by Cuban Government troops who are on the
alert to all persons to enter or leave the area.

Office, component, or station: Station, Habana, Cuba

Inclusive dates for which recommended: 12-26 March 1958

Assignment completed: Yes

Now in same or related assignment: No.

Achievement performed:

Towards the latter part of 1957, as a result of an increasing number
of alarming reports concerning alleged Communist penetration and support
of Fidel Castro's 26 of July Movement operating in the Sierra Saestra
mountains, the Western Hemisphere Division became aware of the urgent need
to mount an operation to acquire first-hand and reliable information and
data on the Cuban rebel forces. In early January 1958, Ur. Crozier
volunteered to undertake the precarious mission to contact Fidel Castro
in his mountain retreat in the Sierra Maestras. He arranged for his free


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

passage into the Sierras through contacts within the 26 of July Hovement which the Station developed earlier. After the necessary arrangements, Mr. Crozier left La Habana on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras under the escort of a rebel guide who conducted him safely through the Cuban Army lines. During the course of approximately twenty days' stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquarters, Mr. Crozier was exposed to many hardsnips and great personal risks. On 26 March 1958, Mr. Crozier accompanied Fidel Castro and a force of xxxxx 200 men on a dawn attack on the town of Manzanillo, where he broke off contact with the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana. Mr. Crozier successfully accomplished his mission by reporting considerable intelligence and operational information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic coverage of his trip.

Thesexploits together with the achievement-set forth below, clearly demonstrater deneses Mr. Crozier's adaptability in precarious situations, as well as a deep devotion to his work and to CIA.

On 1 May 1953, Mr. Crozier.........

(Copy attached report)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

On 1 May 1953, 12. CRUZIER was in charge of an attempt to physically penetrate the home of Manuel MORA Valverde, president of the Costa Rican Communist Party for the purpose of obtaining documents which could te used to prove the Communist Party's control over the partido Progresista Independiente, a front which had been organized to participate in the 1953 elections. The sub-agent who was to actually perform the penetration failed to appear and realizing the urgency of the operation, CROCIER voluntarily made the penstration. At the time aprox (0400) he entered the MORA house, the entire family was known to be sleeping in the rear part of the house. Working quietly and quickly under conditions of considerable personal risk, Mr. CROZIAR succeeded in carrying away approximately 85 percent of the legal PPI documentation and other records as well as a large amount of Communist Party documents such as minutes to meetings, code words, etc. A few days later a high level party penetration reported that the PPI may have been eliminated from the electoral scene due to the almost impossible task of reconstructing the legally required records. However, the PPI was able to reconstruct the records and registered by the deadline of 26 May. According to the Station, "this operation provided the station with a bulk of compromising documents, seriously hampered-PPI-activities because of missing records, almost eliminated them from the scene, spread distrust, suspicion, and confusion among the Political Commission, and, because it was finally attributed to Figuerista elements, enraged the Communists against FIGURES and destroyed any

possibility of en agreement with or support-for-FIGURES-(HRS-A-212). On 29 May a careful slection of the more compromising documents obtained by

CROZIER'S penetration was mailed to the head of the Regislative Commission investigating the Communist affiliations of the PPI. On fix-5-June an additional batch of the documents were mailed. These papers were selected for their authentici-ty, i.e. carbon copies of letters previously sent to the Assembly by the PPI,

in order to establish the validity of the documents. On 24 July 1953-the -President of Costa Rica signed a bill outlawing the PPI. The participation of Mr. CROZIER in the campaign to prevent the PPI from becoming a legal party is considered to have been instrumental in its success.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI/Staff

SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA - Request for Fromotion....

1. It is requested that Arthur G. Vaivada, a Career Agent, be promoted from GS-11 to grade GS-12 for his outstanding performance in carrying out a precarious mission in line with the objectives of Project AMPHODARCH, in which he is the Principal Agent.

2. In early January 1958, Vaivada volunteered to undertake a mission to contact Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro Ruz in the Sierra Maestra mountains in south-eastern Cuba. He arranged for his free passage into the Sierras through contacts within the 26 July Movement which he and the Station developed earlier. After the necessary arrangements, Vaivada left La Habana on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras under the escort of rebel guides. In the course of approximately twenty days' stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquarters, during which time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied Castro and a force of about: 200 rebels on their dan attack on the town of Manzanillo on 26 March 1958. At Manzanillo, Vaivada broke off contact with the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana.

3. During his relatively short stay in the Sierra Haestra mountains, Vaivada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic coverage of his trip.

4. This exploit is another achievement to be added to the impressive past performances of Arthur G. Vaivada, who has always shown a deep devotion. to his work and to the Agency.

5. Vaivada was born on 20 June 1922, and has been with CIA since 1949. He has been a career agent since 1 June 1957, ana was promoted to the grade of GS-11 on 1 June 1957. His tour of duty in Cuba was from August 1954 until 31 March 1958.

Assessment (sec)

a) Last assignment: Arrived Havana in August 1954 with a one-year scholarship at the University of Havana (Pan American Foundation, University of Florida at Gainesville). This cover adequately set up and well back stopped. I travelled to Gainesville, met the man (Curt Wilgus) on that end of the line and the only documentation necessary was a series of letters from the Foundation that indicated my efforts to obtain the scholarship and finally their grant. After arriving, however, and matriculating at the U of H, it became immediately obvious that the nature of my target was such that my presence within the university was more a handicap then an asset. After a few months at the university, I abandoned studies (it was becoming increasingly difficult anyway due to political disturbances) and turned to freelance photography and writing for my cover. For several months I had the photography on just enough of a paying basis that would satisfy any security surveillance.

Photography and writing was definitely superior to university as cover, since it then gave me the opportunity to work inconspicuously on penetrations within the university.

Concerning general security aspects of that assignment, there was that one incident with the threat to exposure coming out of the death of an amphodarch key agent and my proximity throughout the entire incident. However, there has never been any indication that I was exposed or compromised. The station in Cuba felt that if I could return and operate as free from surveillance as I did, that certainly Cuban security people did not have anything compromising on me.

b) Previous assignments: To the best of my knowledge, I have never been exposed or compromised during the years of operation in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Cuba. There was an incident which prompted an early departure from Guetezala for personal and operational security reasons - but again, there was never any further indication as to the validity of the warning. What occurred - the Costa Rican source MARY - apparently learned from high level party sources that "a US agent, specialist in communist matters, had departed San Jose for Guatemala" and of course, this vagery unfortunately coincided with my arrival at Guatemala. At any rate, I was doing very little at Guatemala and would have departed anyway in view of the deteriorating situation of June 1954.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

Journalistic - AGV

Naturelly, there are many intangibles involved with operating over long periods (almost/years in Cuba) in one place, and then travelling back and forth between areas of previous assignment (Costa Rica), and leet but not least, cultivating corruniete in all these places. Tho question Decотев, Ной хикaugh thorough are these people? Does a Cuban CP character communicate with a Guatemalan or Costa Rican elong lines of security, of movement of Smericans in these areas, and ectuel approaches made? Frobebly not, at their best, the administration is hapnazard. A typical examples Cnce, in 1953, when I was leving Costa Rica, I made a couple of cold approaches one was with women communist, a leader in the Union de Mujeres Carmen Lisa. I walked away from her house she evidently got a taxi right behind me and she went straight to the headquarters and reported to Manuel Mora. But she couldn't describe me - had the story so confused (the a roach story) es to render it useless to them, and absolutely nothing ever came of the incident. (By the same token, it would have been a different story in Cuba.)

Although, even in Cuba, there is not persistence or perseverance in investigations. I was working with a municipal committee youth communist he le a translator and did a story for me in Spenish end he was visiting my home (twice) while I went to his epertment about four timce. I gave him my business card (Dellas Corporation) and some time later a SIM net picked him searched his premises and among other things, turned up my business card. He was queried on it and ateted that he was simuly transleting for me. Now this boy is a known communist, pach they could get nothing on him at this time but such en incident/nave provoked et leest a casual surveillance of me or my premises. Nothing care of this incident either and the station down there would known.

Lastly, the mission up to the Sierra Heestra hee security implications. Not so much concerning communism, but its reasonable to assume thet Cuben security people will come up with my name as having been up there. However, with the pictures "ublished, perheps an article later, there should be enough cover as a writer to neutralize any hazard there.

Pest employment (with us)

a) Conceny or foundations Scholarship from Fanamerican Foundation at University of Florida at Gainesville, from July 1954 to June 1955.

Then the notional cover set up last year (May 1957) was the Public Surveys Institute, venerel Polling Service, 532 Fidelity Union Life Bldg., 1511 3ryan street, Dallas, Texas. This arranged so that any mail or telephone to the above corporation would confirm my company connections and could even be used as a credit reference if necessary. This arrangement was quite satisfactory.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 47

Journalistic - AGV p. 4

b) The security aspects of the Dallas corporation were very good I believe. Since freelance writing at best is considered a weak cover, this corporation connection gave me a more solid standing with more serious creditors such as landlords, banks and the larger merchandizing houses. In addition to the above, this cover was utilized very conveniently in operational instances where a realistic approach story was needed. Communists were approached on the basis of a political polling - this could be narrowed right down to soliciting information on the communists party as a political party. Again, it was always nice to have a business card with addresses and telephone numbers that could be given as immediate reference to any type of security interrogation.

Estimate of Journalistic capability:

While my contributions in fiction have been principally juvenile, my writing training has come largely over a period of years at reportorial writing. Since I have some experience as a photographer also, it is convenient to relate the two, and possibly my best field would be feature and article writing. However, while on the mission with the Castro revolutionary movement, I associated with various members of the press and had no difficulty whatsoever in passing as one of them. Given an adequate period for familiarization, I feel that I could just about move into any press or writing slot that did not require a great deal of copy or tight deadlines.

FROM : Chief of Station, Havana

DATE: 10 April 1958

INFO: Chief of Base, Santiago de Cuba

SUBJECT: GENERAL- Operational/Arthur C. VAIVADA

SPECIFIC- Commendation for Successful Completion of Mission to Sierra Maestra

Action Required: At Headquarters' Discretion

1. The writer wishes to commend Station and Base personnel whose work contributed to the successful preparation, mounting, and execution of the clandestine operation that recently placed a KUBARK Career Agent, Arthur G. VAIVADA, in the Sierra Maestra headquarters of Dr. Fidel CASTRO Ruz for sixteen days in March 1958. This mission resulted in acquisition by KUBARK of considerable important and timely information regarding the CASTRO revolutionary movement that was being urgently requested by customer agencies. In the writer's opinion the operation was a team effort. Giving credit to the staff personnel will in no way detract from the praiseworthy performance of VAIVADA himself.

2. With regard to VAIVADA the personal courage and professional ability as an intelligence officer demonstrated on this mission were of the highest order and should be highly commended. Headquarters is aware, as is the Station, that VAIVADA is desirous of acquiring staff agent status with KUBARK. The writer believes that his desires in this respect should be given consideration as part of any action taken in recognition of VAIVADA's services in the subject operation.

3. Station and Base personnel directly concerned with laying on this operation, arranging for proper briefing and support of VAIVADA, and recovering him securely when he left the Sierra Maestras, were Humphrey I. EBERLEIN, James E. PALINGER, and Nelson L. RAYHOCK.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: General: Training/Briefing of DDP Personnel

Specific: Briefing of Rose L. Crosier, who is
scheduled to be the new undercover
CP. Officer for Station Mexico City.

1. In Havana, Cuba on 5 March 1958, 1 briefed Rose L. Crozier concerning:

a) his proposed new assignment in Mexico; and

b) Headquarters desire that he receive special briefings from CI/ICD prior to going to Mexico.

2. Crozier stated that he was very glad to receive the briefing because he had not had a clear picture of what the proposed assignment in Mexico involved. He was pleased to find out that it was a pure penetration assignment. He also responded enthusiastically to the idea of receiving Headquarters briefings prior to going to the Field. He stated that he would like to have a short leave in Costa Rica prior to receiving the Headquarters briefing.

3. On 2 April 1958 in Washington, D.C., the undersigned and Mr. E. L. Anderson, Chief, CI/ICD-WH, briefed Crosier further concerning the matter discussed above, reaffirming our keen interest in the assignment.. Mr. Anderson pointed out to him that his (Crozier's) "partner" in Mexico City (the inside CP officer), was in Costa Rica

and that if securely feasible it would be a good idea for the two men to meet there. Mr. Crozier stated that he thought that it could be done readily and securely as he will contact the Embassy normally as an American citizen and he is well acquainted with COS, San Jose. One of the elements in our plan for intensification of the CPPP in Mexico is that these two very capable officers should get to know one another well in order to function smoothly and efficiently as a team.

4. Mr. Crosier stated that he plans to return to Washington, D.C., from his leave in Costa Rica during the approximata period 20-25 April 1958. Chief, CI/ICD-WH is handling arrangements for the briefing of Mr. Crozier.

MEMORANDUM Arthur Vaivada

SUBJECT: Subject of our letter number 4025; interest in Assignment in U. S.

Palinger Sapier

1. In recent conversations with both JRP and RDS, Subject has broached the prospect of a possible assignment within the U. S. following completion of his Habana assignment. He says he would not want his statements re reassignment which were recently forwarded to Headquarters to be interpreted to mean that he is not interested in a J. S. tour. He says that he has been giving much thought to his future career, as well as to the needs of his family. He points out that he personally has now spent approximately. 16 years, excepting vacations and short training perioas, living ma working outside the U. S., that nis two cnilaren have never lived there, and that both he and his wire are concerned that too much time will elapse before they can provide their children with a period in the U. S. during their formative years.

2. It is the opinion of both KDS and JKP that Subject is at a point in his career development where a tour at Headquarters would be extremely beneficial. The Station lacks knowledge concerning the specific Headquarters jobs to which a person of Subject's status might be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR sometimes emplcys these persons as instructors. ke believe that a tour with OTK would not only remedy in great measure deficiencies in Subject's background caused by lack of Headquarters experience, but would at the same time afford OnR excellent instructor material.

3. In view of Subject's own interest in such an assignment, and our estimate of the potential value to him and to the Organization that would accrue from it, we recomend that Headquarters arrange such an assignment if at all possible.

4. In view of the likelihood of Subject's transfer in the near future, a prompt decision is requested.

Action Required: As indicated in paragraph 1.

1. With reference to KUSODA's request that VAIVADA be given an LCFLUTTER test as soon as possible, we have taken the position that, insomuch as he is to return to Headquarters in June, there is little point in incurring the added expense for a trip now. However, he should understand that his continued employment under his now contract is contingent upon satisfactory completion of such a test. This, of course is no different from the requirements made of any employee; there merely is a time lag in his case because of distance. KUSODA has agreed to the delay pending VAIVADA is so advised.

2. Although we do not expect any problem if VAIVADA is disturbed over having something like this hanging fire, and you feel there is a real morale problem involved, we will go ahead with it now. Our action will be entirely dependent upon ROCODA's evaluation of the degree of importance this has for VAIVADA.

SPECIFIC-Arthur G. VAIVADA

Reference: HHH-W-2380, dated 16 October 1957-

1.  The Subject has no objection to submitting to an LCFLUTTER test at the convenience of Headquarters. This could be easily arranged here in the event an LCFLUTTER team is passing, or could pass, through Habana; on the other hand, VAIVADA could just as easily go to any designated place in Florida in order to take this test. It is understood that LCFLUTTER teams from time to time visit that state.

2.  The Station will take such measures as are feasible to cover the activities of Subject and his wife while in Habana.

3.  While the matter was not referred to in the reference, Subject's projected one-year tour of duty will end in June, 1958, at which time it is VAIVADA's desire to leave Cuba for a reassignment in another area in his present line of operational work and under similar unofficial cover conditions. A detailed dispatch on this subject will shortly be trans- mitted to Headquarters; it is referred to here so that the Headquarters desk may be alerted to the need for considering what assignments would be open to VAIVADA during the Spring or Summer of 1958.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

SUBJECT: Request for Conversion of Arthur G. VAIVADA From Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE: HKH-A-2577

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a strong case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract capacity since 1949, with a continuous high level of performance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is currently assigned to Cuba and is expected to remain there indefinitely. VAIVADA is 34 years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent of a GS-10 rating. His expressed career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments, for which he is highly suited.

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) is a Costa Rican citizen, a situation which complicates his proposed conversion somewhat. She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, however, and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the next several months, barring unforeseen developments. She will be required to spend most of this period in the U.S. and is currently making plans to do so.

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent, his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a career with CIA, it is recommended that he be granted staff status at grade CS-11, contingent upon his wife's first becoming a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet Security and other requirements. There is available in WH Division a staff position (BAF-409) to which VAIVADA can be assigned.

4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training in the near future.

5. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADA from contract to staff status, as indicated above, is hereby requested.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA; Staff Status

1. The undersigned discussed case this date with Mr. Myers (2709 "I"; telephone extension 2551-2552) and with Mr. Pennington (2044 "I") both of Security Division. Mr. Myers was shown the content of HKH-A-(recommendation for staff status for VAIVADA) and apprised of the problem of Mrs. VAIVADA not being a U.S. citizen. Myers stated that, while cases like this were usually very difficult, he felt this particular one might be justified in view of VAIVADA's long and excellent record with the Agency and the relatively long time during which he has been married. Myers indicated that the procedure would be as follows:

Presentation of a formal request for waiver on citizenship requirements for spouse and granting of staff status to Subject. The memorandum would be prepared for Personnel, would then go to Security, and subsequently, with recommendations of both, to Deputy Director, who would have the final decision in this case.

Myers was to discuss the matter further with other elements of Security and advise within the next several days as to what the next step should be.

2. Considering the possibility that such a request might be turned down, the undersigned discussed with Pennington the procedures for acquisition of citizenship for Mrs. VAIVADA, and determined that this should be relatively simple. The requirements vere: presence in the U.S. (vicinity of Washington) for approximately forty-five days with some additional time to acquire passport. So long as we have nothing that would make her inadmissable to the U.S., the basic requirements would bes ability to speak English and to pass a relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be given to her for study. Security would presumably handle her case when she arrives in the States.

3. It has occurred to the undersigned that perhaps, if it is necessary for Mrs. VAIVADA to acquire citizenship, VAIVADA himself could be brought to the washington vicinity for training purposes in order to facilitate the visit of his wife, expenses, etc. This would at the same time afford an opportunity to provide VAIVADA with formal Headquarters or PBPRIME training of which ho heo chud none to date.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: Proposed Staff Status for Arthur G. VAIVADA

REFERENCE: HKH-A-2577, 17 April 1956

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a good case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of performance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is 34 years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent of a grade GS-10. His expressed career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments, for which he is highly suited.

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) is a Costa Rican citizen. Preliminary investigation at Headquarters has revealed that Subject's conversion to staff status is virtually out of the question so long as his wife remains an alien. It has also been determined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizenship within a span of 45 days if she so desires and is willing to come to the U.S. for that period of time. This would remove the major stumbling block to acquisition of staff status for VAIVADA.

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent, his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a career with CIA, it is recommended that (a) VAIVADA's wife be encouraged to seek U.S. citizenship under the terms outlined above (b) VAIVADA be granted staff status, contingent upon his wife's first becoming a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other requirements. C/WH/III has endorsed the recommendation for staff status and a suggestion by C/WH/Admin that BAF-409, a new position currently alloted to San Jose, be transferred to Habana to be filled by VAIVADA.

4. It is further recommended that WH Division consider bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincide with his wife's stay (at Headquarters' convenience). This would facilitate acquisition of citizenship for the wife and at the same time afford VAIVADA a chance for additional Headquarters training. Subject previously received covert training at Headquarters from 5 October through 25 November 1953.

1. At the time the request was submitted to convert Subject from Contract Agent to Career Agent status, a provisional covert security clearance was granted for that purpose. KUSODA recently advised that a full covert security clearence had been granted for the use of Subject as Principal Agent, under-official cover, in Project AMPLITUDE/CH, in accordance with the providions set forth in the memorandum of the Chief, KIBAIK, dated 14 February 1949, entitled "Security and Operational Nearences".

2. At the same time, KUSODA requested the following action to he taken:

a. That full overseas traces and such actual overseas investigation as is possible be taken on Subject and his wife and her family; and,

b. That arrangements he made to have Subject affronted with a LCFLUTTER test as soon as feasible.

3. Headquarters has already initiated the action set forth in Para 2 (a) requesting full traces and investigation of Subject and his wife and her family in Panama City and San Jose. Todate only San Jose has replied with HRS-2938, copy of which was sent to Habana. Station Habana is requested to take appropriate action to cover Subject's and his wife's activities during their residence in Habana, and inform Headquarters of the results.

4. With reference to KUSODA's request for a LCFLUTTER test on Subject, they have expressed their desire to have Subject tested in the field as soon as possible, or as soon as time appropriate arrangements can be made. KUSODA has indicated that they will be happy to assist in arranging this test.

However, Headquarters would appreciate receiving the Station's views and comments on the matter as quickly as possible so that KUSODA may be advised and can make the necessary planning.

5. The station is reminded that subjects of covert security clearances are not to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of KUBARK. Your attention is also called to the fact that a covert security clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions KUBARK Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if the station should desire at a later date to change the status or use of Subject, a request for clearance to cover any proposed change should be submitted to Headquarters.

Memo on Cover Status - Arthur G. Vaivada

1.  Enclosed herewith is the outline of an idea in keeping with the nature of this notional cover plan of a temporary nature. Careful consideration has been given to a number of ideas, all of which were rejected because possible local conflicts. This idea is still general enough (and I hope convincing) to leave opportunity for changes and/or improvement at Headquarters. The idea, and the terminology, was gleaned from the pages of "Investment in Cuba", a July 1956 study published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

2.  As I understand this cover arrangement, the P3I should mail me a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed information. This should "hold us" for a couple of months, with possibly some queries from me occasionally. Then when our operational picture requires investigation in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to request a survey or poll in that field.

3.  On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and allied materials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration of this "Agency" and then advise PSI as to the legal requirement.

1. Public Surveys Institute of Dallas, Texas, has placed a US representative in Cuba for the purpose of conducting public surveys, by polling, which will provide the home office with the requisite data for periodic market analyses. These periodic reports will be made available upon subscription to US investment and/or distribution agencies, and will contain comprehensive studies of market potentials and limitations, including the role of government as affected by current political developments.

2. PSI of Dallas will first compile reports of broad scope, from which subscribers may select their fields of special interest and place thier orders accordingly. These initial reports will cover such factors as:

a) The three P's - Population and Purchasing Power.

b) Productive Opportunities.

c) Improved Distribution Patterns.

d) Factors Affecting Derand.

e) A Study of Marketing Areas.

f) General Estimate of the Economic Situation.

3. The PSI representative will not require an office installation or local employees during the initial studies, but will prepare these at his residence until special requests are forthcoming from subscribers. At that time, all materials and installations as well as employment will be of temporary contractual nature, entirely dependent upon the scope of the survey.

ATTN : Mr. James B. Holand

DATE: 10 June 1957

FROM : AC/OS/TR

SUBJECT: Training Report on Arthur G. VAIVADA, (P)

Training Alias: "VICKS".

1. Arthur G. VAIVADA was trained covertly by instructors of this office in Washington, D.C. from 25 March 1957 through 7 May 1957. The original Training Request form dated 4 December 1955 reveals the following information concerning his background, experience and proposed assignment:

"VAIVADA is thirty-four years of age, married and a U.S. citizen by birth. He attended high school in De Kalb, Illinois and entered the U.S. Army in 1940. later transferring to the U.S. Air Force. The trainee served as an operations and intelligence specialist, first in the China/Burma theatre and later in Panama. He vas discharged from the service in 1945. Following his discharge, VAIVADA worked for a short period as a laboratory technician in the Sterling Silica-Gel Corporation, Illinois and then returned to the Panama Canal Zone to work as a stevedor and a labor foreman. He reenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in April 1946 and was honorably discharged in 1949. On 1 June 1949, VAIVADA became a contract agent for this Agency. He served in this capacity in Costa Rica, handling a high level penetration of the Communist Party until 1953. In July 1954, the trainee became principal agent of Froject AMPHODARCH. He has been operating under a student cover, working for his A.B. degree at the University of Havana. It is planned that VAIVADA will return to Havana, Cuba under cover of a representative of a well known U.S. polling agency. He will perform the duties of principal agent, handling a large net of sub-agent informants in Cuban university youth circles to provide coverage of Communist, leftist, revolutionary and other political activities among these groups."

2. The instructors who participated in VAIVADA's training indicate that his overall performance was above average. He is a highly intelligent, practical and realistic young man possessing excellent judgment and common sense. His motivation is strong and his interest in ciandestine activity as a profession appears to be genuine. VAIVADA should continue to develop as a skilled and competent agent.

The official to whom this report is entrusted is personally responsible for it. Although he may. within his discretion. it to other members of his staff, the report should never be shown to the student whom it concerns.

INSTRUCTOR'S COMMENTS

Arthur G. VAIVADA impressed this instructor most favorably. The trainee is highly intelligent, practical and realistic. He possesses excellent judgment and common sense. VAIVADA is mature, well-balanced, resourceful and positive. He appears to be open-minded and objective, possessing a questioning mind and a strong sense of curiosity. VAIVADA approached training with a strong desire to add to his knowledge and to refine his own methods and techniques. He was highly receptive and amenable to constructive criticism. The trainee has a feeling for detail and is observant and careful in the collection of facts. It was necessary for VAIVADA to spend considerable time on administrative matters during the training. However, he completed all outside assignments punctually and completely.

VAIVADA's performance was excellent. He is above average in every aspect. His motivation is strong and his interest in clandestine activity as a profession appears to be genuine. If properly supervised, he should be a valuable asset to this organization. The trainee appears to be industrious, possessing initiative with leadership qualities.

1. Subject and his wife arrived in Habana on 14 May 1957 and have taken permanent quarters here; their children rejoined them the following weekend.

2. As outlined in the reference, and after conversation with VAITADA himself, the national polling cover arrangement set up for the approsinate three-month trial period appears adequate. At present Subject and the case officer are engaged in working out a suitable area or areas for his polling activities and will shortly notify Headquarters of the results.

3. There is being forwarded as a separate cover attachment an administrative memorandum from Subject, informing Headquarters that he established a tank account in Miami, Florida, and his wishes respecting amounts of his salary and allowances to be deposited there following 1 June 1957. Subject's initial opening deposit in the Miami bank account was in the amount of $20.00; the "copy of check with true name and present balance" mentioned in the attached memorandum is being retained in Station files. It is requested that the Station be notified by cable of the amount of total salary and allowances to be paid direct to Subject each month in the field after 1 June.

FROM:
Chief, CI/ICD

SUBJECT:
General: CP Penetration Program

Specific: Informal discussion with Ross Lester Crozier,
9 May 1957, re his interest in, and availability
for recruitment approaches in various Latin
American countries.

1. On 9 May 1957, Mr. Paul J. Burke, Deputy Chief, CI/ICD, held Subject discussion with Mr. Crozier, whom he met outside of official quarters through the cooperation of Mr. High MacAuley, WH/Cuba.

2. Mr. Crozier has a fine record in CP penetration work. He did an outstanding job in handling the HUMANOID-3 operation in Costa Rica over an extended period, and he has worked hard in the CP penetration program in Cuba since his arrival there.

3. It is believed that he would be an effective recruiter in various countries in Latin America.

4. He stated that he was keenly interested in, and would like to engage in, such operations, and would welcome being asked to hit a well-chosen target in any (Spanish-speaking) Latin American country.

5. Mr. Crozier stated that he expects to return to Cuba shortly. If, after three months, there is no indication that his security has been adversely affected by the recent assassination of one of his agents, he expects to be there about a year.

6. It is recommended that WH Division give consideration to employing Mr. Crozier is a recruiter when worthwhile recruitment-in-place CP targets are developed, or otherwise arise, in various Latin American countries. It is again made clear for the record that the foregoing discussion was informal and without commitment on either side.

1. Attached for your retention is a copy of Subject's new contract converting his status from that of Contract Agent 06-10 to Career Agent - K-11, to become effective 1 June 1957. Also attached is a copy of an amendment to his current contract, providing for the payment of storage of his household effects in Kabana and quarters allowances for his family in San Jose, Costa Rica, for the period Subject was absent from his post. Subject read and signed the originals of both the amendment and new contract while at Headquarters.

2. Before Subject departed for the field, he was interviewed three times by one of the Headquarters staffs concerning his cover, and arrangements were made to fulfill the station's requirement for his return. However, since the polling cover originally planned for Subject could not be arranged at this time, a *notional* polling cover, adequately backstopped by a business mailing address and telephone number (being submitted under separate cover as Identity-A) was arranged as the alternative. Since Subject is returning to his post on a test basis, Headquarters feels that this notional cover is better than a more permanent arrangement would be; at least until it is more/certain that Subject's stay will be permanent, thus avoiding any possible embarrassment vis-a-vis the employer company in the event Subject is forced to leave the country shortly after arrival. Furthermore, this notional cover will allow Subject almost complete freedom to pursue his other activity with very little time and effort necessary to maintain his cover. Appropriate business letterheads and cards to implement Subject's cover will be pouched to the Station as soon as Subject is able to survey the area and notify Headquarters of the type of polling activity he plans to use. He was instructed to select a polling activity not

presently covered by another agency, so as to minimize the possibility of instigating inquiries about his employer by the cometitors in the area. Should Subject remain at his post, and it is hoped he will, the cover originally planned can be armngeni later if Subject or the Station feels that the present cover is not adequate enough & er, on the other hand, ho can continue to use the present arrangezent.

3. With respect to the payment of his salary and allowances, Subject was instructed to open a tank account here before he returned to the field. Headquarters requests he subait the name of the bark and the amount of his salary and allowances (preferably in round figures) he wishes to be paid by the Station. The balance will be paid wonthly to his bank by Headquar tero. Headquarters requires that this arrangement be set up to simplify and expedite his paymente in the event of any changes in calary or allow arces. Subject said he would give the information to the Station for transmittal to Headquarters.

4. It is regretted that Subject's wife war pot able to become na- turalized at this time, since the entered this country on a temporary visitor's visa, and it would have taken too long to change har status to that of a permanent resident and become naturalized. Since the conversion of Subject's status to tint of a Career Agent wis not affected by his wife's citizenship, it was suggested to Subject that he plan to have his wife become a citizen when he returns to this country in two years upon becoming:
   eligible for statutory home leave.

5. Subject still has en outstanding travel voucher being processed at Headquarters, and the Station will be notified as soon as it is con pleted. Subject has been paid in full for his salary and allowances for the month of April 1957.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Vaivada

1.  During the morning of 30 April Mr. Millard of Cover tele-
    phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508. Mr. Millard said that
    he would be meeting with Vaivada at 1600 hours today and proposed
    providing him with a temporary rather than permanent cover with
    the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range
    development. Mr. Millard's reasoning was that he did not wish
    to place Vaivada under the new company with the chance that the
    trial period approved for the Station might cause Vaivada to be
    pulled out from that cover in short order. Mr. Millard said that
    the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.

2. I concurred with the above proposal.

1.  Reference is made to your memorandum dated 28 February 1957, wherein a provisional covert security approval and a covert security approval wero requested to enable the Subject's conversion to career agent status for use as Principal Agent for Froject AMPHODARCH in Cuba, under non-official cover.

2.  In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Field Regulation 10-215, a provisional covert security approval is granted for the use of the Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph fl, above.

3.  It should be noted that the provisional covert security approval herein granted is based on limited investigative coverage and should not be in any way construed as a final security deter- mination relative to a full covert security approval. Upon com- pletion of additional investigation now pending, you will be ap- propriately advised as to our decision with regard to the issuance of a full covert security approval.

4.  Subjects of provisional covert security approvals are not to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of CIA.

5.  Your attention is called to the fact that a provisional covert security approval does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should desire at a later date to change the status or use of this individual, a request for approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this office.

6.  This approval becomes invalid in the event the Subject's services are not utilized within 60 days of the date of this memo- randum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Office of Security

VIA:
Chief, CI/CA

SUBJECT:
Arthur G. VAIVALA (ep.)
C-25507

1.  Reference is made to OS's verbal request of 7 March 1957, for additional information on Subject in connection with our request for a Provisional Covert Security Approval dated 26 February 1957.

2.  Subject was born in De Kalb, Illinois, on 20 June 1922. He received his primary and high school education in De Kalb and entered the U. S. Army in 1940, later transferring to the U. S. Air Force. Ho served as an operations and intelligence specialist, first in the China-Burma theater and later in Panama. He was discharged from the service in 1945 with the grade of Technical Sergeant. After his discharge, he worked for a brief period as a laboratory technician in the Sterling (Illinois) Silica-Cel Corporation and then returned to the Panama Canal Zone to marry a Costa Rican girl in December 1945. For about four months he worked as a stevedore and labor foreman in the Canal Zone. In April 1946 he re-enlisted in the Air Force in the Canal Zone and was discharged three years later, in 1949.

3.  Late in 1943 he was recruited by the Agency, and on 1 June 1949 became a CIA contract agent. Since that date, he has served as a contract agent with continuing high level performance, first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is currently assigned to Cuba where he is utilized as Principal Agent of Project AGHODARCH. Subject has worked principally and successfully so, on Communist Party penetration operations since his engagement with CIA, and his current work involves the handling of a net of agents providing coverage of Communist, leftist, revolutionary and other political activities at the University of Habana, and the student-youth circles in general in Cuba.

4.  Subject has always proven to be loyal and trustworthy. In view of his outstanding record and strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a career with CIA, it has been recommended he be converted from contract to career agent status. He was promoted recently to the equivalent of a GS-10 rating.

Action Required: Notify Headquarters if Any Objection to Action Para. 3

1. Headquarters has no objection to the postponement of VAIVADA's training until the end of the current contract year (July-August 1957), and has cancelled immediate training arrangements accordingly. The Station should submit a new request several months prior to the desired new training dates.

2.  There has been a change, meanwhile, in Headquarters thinking on the proposed conversion of VAIVADA to Staff status. Upon reviewing the case, the responsible Headquarters staff suggested that career agent status would be more appropriate and recommended that the requested personnel action be changed accordingly. The Staff pointed out that virtually all benefits which would accrue to VAIVADA under staff status are also obtainable as a career agent. These include Civil Service Retirement, Sick and Annual Leave, Home Leave Travel, Periodic Step Increases, and coverage under the Federal Employment Compensation and Missing Persons Acts. He would also be eligible for certain KUBARK insurance plans, subject to security and other special considerations. The one exception is that VAIVADA would remain on a contract basis, meaning that his job security would be somewhat less than that of staff personnel. His contract would be for an indefinite period, however, and his job security would closely approximate that of a staff agent.

3. In discussing VAIVADA's conversion, the reviewing staff also noted that VAIVADA would not necessarily be granted staff status, even though his wife were to become a U.S. citizen, and would definitely not qualify for same at this time. In view of this development and the generally favorable benefits accruing to a career agent, the Division has resubmitted its conversion request to provide for career rather than

staff status, at Crate CS-11. It is felt that the career status provides most, if not all, of the benefits sought for VAIVADA in HRH-4-2577. It will now be unnecessary, moreover, for Mr. VAIVADA to acquire U.S. citizenship, although Headquarters stands ready to facilitate acquisition of same if the VAIVADA so desire.

4. Should there be any objection, on the part of the Station at VAIVADA, to this latest proposal, Headquarters would appreciate an early indication to that effect, in order that other arrangements might be made. It would appear at this time, however, that the proposed career status is the most favorable that VAIVADA could expect.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

SUBJECT: Request for Conversion of Arthur G. VAIVADA from Contract to Career Agent Status

REFERENCE: HKH-A-2577

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status and presents a strong case for such conversion. Upon receiving a formal WHD request for such action, however, your Plans Staff suggested that career agent status would be more appropriate in this case, and further indicated that staff status for VAIVADA is virtually out of the question at this time. The request is being re-submitted, therefore, in revised form to provide for conversion to career rather than staff status.

2. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract capacity since 1949, with a continuous high level of performance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is currently assigned to Cube and is expected to remain there indefinitely. VAIVADA 1s 34 years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent of a GS-10 rating. His expressed career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments, for which he is highly suited.

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent, his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a career with CIA, it is recommended that he be granted career agent status. A PHS and a new contract check list (in duplicate) are attached.

4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training during the latter part of 1957.

5. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADA from contract to career agent status, as indicated above, is hereby requested.

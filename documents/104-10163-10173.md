MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMBIDDY-1

DATE: 7 January 1965, 2130 Hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 reported that Manolin Hernandez arrived from Central America and reported that Vico Starke and Frank Marshall, with the support of General Anastacio Somoza of Nicaragua, were planning a coup against President Francisco Orlich in Costa Rica. A-l planned to depart Miami for Managua at 0700 hours, 8 January on Lanica airline to check this information with General Somoza and to attempt to ensure that his equipment is not being used to carry out the coup. A-1 will have his private communications pad and promised to send us a message as soon as he talked with General Somoza and with the Orlichs and Starke in Costa Rica.

2. A-1 agreed to try to return to New York on Saturday, 9 January, for a meeting with Mr. Archer (Chief, WH). A-1 will call as soon as he arrives in New York at which time arrangements will be made to bring him to Washington for the meeting.

3. A-1 reported he and Al Burt had signed a non-aggression pact. A-1 feels there is little to gain from his point of view in continuing the squabble with Burt.

# 8 March 1965

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Fhase-out of ARTINE Autonomous Group

1. On the night of 5 March 1965, the case officer for Manuel ARTINE Buesa met with him and outlined the policy decision reached by the 303 Committee on 4 March. ARTINE vas told the decision was to terminate our operational relationship in as friendly and cooperative manner as possible, but not later than 1 May 1965. The case officer had been empowered to convey this information and to conduct an exploratory discussion of the problems and possible solutions connected with a phase-out program. The two main points the United States Government was concerned with wore (a) fair but reasonable demobilisation support to the personnel of the autonomous group, and (b) ARTINE's assistance in insuring that the balance of power in Central America vas not upset, particularly by preventing the weapons of his group from falling into the hands of political extresists or free-booters.

2. ARTINE had been on notice for several months that a phase-cat might be ordered at any time, and had an inkling that the decision had been made because his regular monthly subsidy had not been received on schedule. He had obviously given the matter considerable thought and made up his mind as to his course of action when he arrived at the mosting. He began the discussion by summarizing the things he might have done had he been so inclined. Among the possibilities mentioned, te included loading up his troops and weapons and taking over Haiti as a base against Cuba, intervening in Costa Rica to bring down the libera. PLN administration in favor of a rightist junta of dissidents, or throwing in completely with General Anastacio in Nicaragua the weapons, personnel and equipment of the autonomous group. He has the capability of fielding an infantry battalion reinforced with artillery (4.2 mortars), supported by air and maritins elements, with a cadre of trained and combat- experienced Cubans, provided he teams up with an organisation

who can furnish about 1,000 men to flesh out the unit. Case officer acknowledgei last we recognized his potential for harmful action, had considered it thoroughly, and hoped he would not do anything of the kind. ARTIME said he had also considered all the possibilities and concluded there was no point in his being childish and trying to "bite us about the ankles."

3. ARTIME accepts the decision and will cooperate in a phase-out program. He does not understand the rationale, and, of course, does not agio with the decision, but he acknowledges our prerogative to make it. If we really wish still to be friends, he is willing, just as he told Mr. FitzGerald originally. He asks only that we help him make it possible to remain friendly and nakes two requests from us: (a) help take care of his men. and their families until they can rehabilitate and resettle themselves, and (b) do everything possible to get his parents out of Cuba.

4. The major elements to be considered in a phase- out vere discussed with the following results:

Personnel. The first priority is support payments to dependents which were due 1 March in the total amount of $100,00. This must be done soonest if ARTINE is to maintain control of the situation. The next most inmediate problem is re-entry permission for fifteen of his men who have been stranded in Nicaragua trying to return to the United States since. December. These men were ex- filtrated "black" from the United States with our assistance and require special authority for... re-entry from Department of State and Department of Justice, which we thought was arranged in early January.

The demobilization plan proposed by ARTIME seered as realistic and effective as could be hoped for. Pe proposes to return the bulk of his men, approximately 200, to the United States during March and give then one month's pay on 1 April as a mustering out payment to support them and their families while they seek other employment. The balance of his men, less than 100, will be held in Central America for one month longer as a security and administrative force muster the group's equipent at Monkey Point from which disposition can be made during the month


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

-3-

of April. The security force will be returned during April and will be paid a mustering out payment on 1 May. This will terminate the project.

The cover story which ARTINE intends to use for demobilization is to inform his men that their mothership is out of commission and will require about six veoks for repairs. This is true enough so that it will be believed. He will then grant leave to all men with dependents to get their personal affairs in order before operations commence again. He will publicize the fact that it is less expensive and better for morale to send them on leave than to have man sitting around the camps with no operations to run. When all the first contingent are back home, individual notice will be given each to start looking for other work as operations have been postponed. They will be told that the salary payment of 1 April will be the last one and should be considered as a mustering out bonus. ARTINE ?eels this method will soften the impact and lover the noise level as the men will be home with their families and scattered throughout the community instead of being in an organized group in Central America when they realize they are being demobilized.

b. Funda. ARTINE had done his homework and brought with him facts and figures upon which phase-eut costs could be estimated. These cost estimates are outlined below:

|                    |                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 March - $100,000 | Dependents support and salaries                                                        |
| 25,000             | Travel from Central America to U.8. for approx. 200 mon                                |
| 50,000             | Accrued debts due 1 March, mainly food and other expenses for camps in Central America |
| $175,000           | (In lieu of regular monthly subsidy of $225,000)                                       |

|                    |                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 April - $100,000 | Mustering out payment for 200 men and salaries for security and administrative details |
| 12,500             | Travel fron Central America to U.S. for approx. 100 men                                |
| 12,500             | Estimated food and other camp expenses                                                 |
| $125.000           |                                                                                        |

1 May - $ 50,000 Mustering out payments for approx. 100 men and final contractual obligations of project

$ 50,000

c. Weapons. ARTIME agreed that it would be in nobody's interest for his weapons to fall into the wrong hands. He was asked for ideas on disposition of the arms and came up with the following suggestion which appears to be an excellent one. The mothership, MV SANTA MARIA, is in need of repairs and must go into a shipyard. Tentative arrangements have been made to put her in the yards at Galveston, Texas, some time in March or April. ARTIME can order his security detail to store the arms aboard the ship for "security" reasons before she leaves for the yard. They will simply remain on board when the ship leaves and we can take control of the ship and the weapons from that point on.

d. Maritime.

(1) MV SANTA MARIA. See above. The ship would be sailed from Monkey Point with a contract crew supplied by Chester, Blackburn, & Roder, Inc. of New York, who are agents for the ship's owner, Libernic Corporation, a CIA proprietary company. One of ARTIME's senior officers would accompany the ship as his representative, with orders to turn over control of it and the arms upon its arrival at Galveston. CIA officers, possibly documented as Customs officials, would accept custody and Office of Logistics could recover the weapons and any other equipment which might be shipped by this method. The ship would then be disposed of according to Headquarters wishes at any time after 17 April when the charter arrangement with General SOMOZA expires and the ship legally reverts to control of the owner.

(2) Swifts, V-20's, Boston Whalers, rubber boats and other operational craft are all owned, technically, by ARTIME's group. He has had title to the Swifts legally transferred from a Costa Rican politician to one of his own senior officers. He wants to retain these craft for the time being, hoping against hope that lightning will strike and he may, after all, be able to use them in the next


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

-5-

two months. Case officer recommends we go along with him on this. at least for the time being, as it could be sticky legally and might antagonize him at the time whom we most need his cooperation. In the end, he should be reasonable about disposition of these craft if we shoot square with him in the meantime.

(3) Support craft, LCMs, Barges, etc. Disposition arrangements to be worked out together on these craft.

e. Aircraft.

(1) DC-3. ARTIME is willing to release the aircraft back to its "owners," TASA, a CIA proprietary company in Panama. However, one month's charter payment of $1,250 was due 1 March, and another will be due by the time the aircraft can be returned. ARTIME was reluctant to let the plane go back without payment, but also reluctant to squeeze the $2,500 out of his budget. Case officer voiced his opinion that the owner would probably be glad to get the plane back and would not likely think it worth going to court. However, in view of the fact that it would be a "closed-circuit" transaction and would actually cost the Government nothing, it is recommended that a special authorization of $2,500 be channeled to ARTIME for payment in order to maintain ARTIME's reputation for fiscal probity. He will surely appreciate this gesture.

(2) L-20 Beaver and Cessna-180. These aircraft technically belong to ARTIME's group and recovery would be a sticky matter, legally. ARTIME hopes to hold control of these aircraft for the time being, and it is recommended that we go along with him, saving disposition arrangements until later.

5. ARTIME again emphasized at the close of the meeting that he must have soonest the March payments for families as an absolute minimum, before he would face his people and maintain control of them in order to insure an orderly phase-out program.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Chief, WH remarks on Termination of ANWORLD

1. At a meeting with DCWHD/C and Mr. Jenkins on 18 March, Chief, WH expressed general satisfaction with the status of termination of AMWORLD and the plans therefor. He stated specifically that he was pleased with the cooperation of AMBIDDY-1 and ANJAVA-4 and would make it a point to inform higher levels in the Agency and the U. S. Government and put a good word for them on the record. He also directed that they be told:

a. He personally appreciates their cooperation and the good sense, goodwill and maturity they displayed in accepting and executing the U. S. Government decision to terminate their operations.

b. He wants to meet with them personally, at the earliest mutually convenient time, in order to discuss the situation with them.

c. After termination of the paramilitary project is completed, he has some other ideas for ventures of mutual interest which he wishes to pursue with them.

2. The gist of the above points had been passed to AMBIDDY-1 and AMJAVA-4 previously by Mr. Jenkins, and on the night of 18 March he confirmed by telephone to AMJAVA-4 that Chief, WH had expressed the above sentiments.

Reference : DIR 98189

1. Ref cable raises a number of fundamental issues of concern to Caracas Station. In brief, we do not welcome an activation of the movement's center in Caracas, an event which would greatly complicate our operational situation. We have reasons for believing that the host government likewise would probably be embarrassed if AMBIDDY 1 chose Venezuela as a base for whatever program he is planning to undertake. Repeated failures of his attempts at being received by President LEONI are significant in this context.

2. Since we must assume that AMBIDDY 1 has alluded to his close ties with KUBARK (and more specifically with BECKHOFF), the Venezuelan security services may well jump to the conclusion that AMWORLD is in fact a KUBARK operation and sooner or later we would be forced to disavow AMBIDDY 1, a circumstance of which he would be bound to learn with consequent embitterment. All these predictable developments, Caracas is most anxious to forestall. Needless to say, both BECKHOFF and OPTRICK are unhappy about this situation of conflict since it involves a man who both admire and who (in their opinion) has served OUTONE interests loyally, at times to the detriment of his abiding cause to liberate FARIDE.

3. For the above reasons, we would welcome indeed if formal and institutional ties between AMBIDDY 1 and ANJAVA 4 could be put in abeyance, at least to the extent that AMBIDDY 1 be prevailed upon to pass up Venezuela as a base of operations. This discriminatory approach reflects our awareness that

the Government to curtail or surpress the movement.

4. We realise that the Station's position, as set forth above, saddles
   Headquarters with an exceedingly delicate task. While as a last resort we
   could of course drop discreet hints to our Venezuelan liaison contacts
   suggesting the inadvisability of affording AMBIDDY 1 and his associates
   sanctuary in Venezuela, we would only entertain that distasteful prospect as
   a last resort and with the full approval of Headquarters.

5. Another approach, only slightly less unsatisfactory, would be to
   restrict AMBIDDY 1's radius of activity to an extent tantamount to denying
   him all freedom of political action while in Venezuela. But all in all, it
   would probably be best for KUBARK if AMBIDDY 1 could be dissuaded from going
   through with his proposed move in a manner which does not hurt his pride and
   which does not alienate him from KUBARK. Headquarters may be able to suggest
   palatable alternatives to Venezuela.

6. As regards ANJAVA 4, we share some of Headquarters misgivings about
   surfacing him to Liaison. What prompted us to suggest this approach was a
   desire to overcome the difficulties which would be facing ANJAVA 4 in any
   case should he decide to make his home here. We are inclined to doubt that
   he could obtain permission to enter Venezuela in immigrant status without
   powerful intercession. He would be used by the Station on projects which
   we (and presumably the host government) view as compatible with Venezuela's
   national security interests.

7. Some of the doubts raised by Headquarters are altogether valid and
   were considered before we made our proposal. We are least concerned, however, about
   the issues of dual loyalty and dual control etc, because it happens to be one of
   our objectives in building a more durable relationship with Liaison, esp DIGEPOL,
   to entice them into joint ventures where dual control does exist. We find ANJAVA 4
   temperamentally suited (esp since his basic loyalty belongs to KUBARK) to serve
   as an operational link between Station and liaison, without acting to the
   detriment of either. Although the tenor of our relationship with DIGEPOL has
   undergone a notable improvement, there are still deep-rooted reservations and
   suspicious which a man of ANJAVA, 4's personality traits might heir to dispel.

8. With regards to the substance of our operations against PERUNIN,
   especially those which are CB-oriented, there is a natural congruity of interests
   between ODYOKE and Venezuela which renders joint pursuits in fact most desirable.
   More likely than not, DIGEPOL will do Station the favor of fecilitating the
   admission of ANJAVA 4 and of providing him with viable cover, maybe including
   official (DIGEPOL) documentation, and let it go at that. We rather doubt that
   unless prodded by Station DIGEPOL would avail itself of ANJAVA 4's services, let
   alone use him to penetrate Station's operational program. This leaves in the
   balance the pros and cons of surfacing a valuable KUBARK asset to liaison.

9. The general concepts guiding Caracas Station in desiring to secure the
   services of ANJAVA 4 were spelled out in OUGA-12052.

10. In presenting Station's proposal to ANJAVA 4, the following points
    could be made:

A. We do not propose that he sever his longstanding personal and
political links with ANBIDDY 1.

B. We do not expect that he disconnect his links with the movement,
let alone cease supporting its program.

C. We would expect, however, and exercizing facility of prediction, within the movement, not reason being that it should be used as far as the local government is concerned to be an admission that NM/M.NE is officially backing AM/AFA.

D. We would expect AM/AFA to compartmentalize himself to the extent that he will treat any knowledge acquired in his connection as operational adjunct to the station as privileged in the sense of not imparting it to anyone without a need to know. Specifically, this information would have to be withheld from AMICOT 1 and other members of the movement.

E. AM/AFA will have to make a clear choice between serving the cause of FREEDOM liberation by actively associating himself with AMWORLD (a doomed undertaking if our reading of the situation is correct), or by countering FREEDOM's program to subvert Venezuela under Station control.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

# 14-00000

## 2.a

A/174/L told me A/1 and A/2 went to Spain on 15 May for 2 or 3 months vacation. A/4 said later that A/2 was starting a new business in Spain and wanted him (A/4) to move over there and manage it for him. A/2 left William Fine, the Vice-President in charge of Maritime Sam in his absence. A-DILDY/1 has always had ultimate control of the AMERIC funds and has simply been exercising closer personal control of them since A/2 is gone.

## 2.b

AMSIDDY/1 told me that he is selling off some of the equipment which is not suitable for his current program of Community Development/Civic Action in Latin America in order to raise money to obtain equipment and materials that will be needed. For example, he has bought 22 acres of farm land near West Palm Beach to establish a model farm for training purposes. He has been conducting evening classes for several weeks for about 20 MRR men, who are working full time at other jobs, in rural Community Development. He has gotten some training materials and advice from Prof. George Lodge of Harvard, who, according to letters from him, appears to be enthusiastic about his contact with A/1 and his organization.

## 2.c

A/1 says his only political plans at this time are to try to continue holding his movement (MRR) together while he changes its emphasis and direction toward the constructive activity of help in Community Development for friendly Latin American countries and away from the PR emphasis for which we supported him in the AMWORLD program. The farm in Nicaragua to cultivate rice is a planned cooperative on the east coast (Bluefields - Monkey Point) to complement a shrimp fishing cooperative and boat yard at Bluefields which he has already discussed with President Schick, who requested him to go ahead. A/1 and the MRR part in these enterprises is purely advisory in training local residents and helping them to organize and build facilities. A/4 reports, and A/1 himself admits, that he is simply feeling around now trying to get all the information and ideas he can about this new field of endeavor. (for example, A/1 just bought 300 baby chicks to work with in order to find out they can best fit into a rural development program.)

## 2.d

Of course, AMWORLD is finished and all members of the organization know it. A/1 and A/4 have both told me they have made it clear to all hands and have advised them to get jobs immediately in order to support their dependents. Most of them have done so, several going back to work for WAVE, for instance. The death of AMWORLD and the reorganization necessary to go into a new phase (Community Development) is no doubt causing a crisis in the MRR, but both leaders believe the movement will weather the crisis and survive. Mr. Tom Clines, who talked with other members of the MRR, believes the same thing, and is certain it will survive with enough support from Washington to pay for publicity, travel, and administrative costs.

## 3.a

There are 5 men at Monkey Point where one cache (a platoon) of weapons is stored. The other two are located at Bluefields and at Managua, under control of the Nicaraguan National Guard. The MRR delegate at Managua is the only person who can authorize their release, and this must be on written authority of A/1 and approved by General Somoza. The 5 men at Monkey Point are simply station-keepers who, in addition to guarding the camp and weapons, are teaching the local Indians to read and write, to operate and maintain basic machinery, and to plant crops to raise their standard of living.

## 3.b

There has been no evidence from any source of any attempts to sell AMWORLD arms or ammunition.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

3.c It is not clear what this source is trying to coort, but presumably he is trying to indicate that A/'l is hoarding the ARLD money he has been issued for his personal use. Aryone who nows 1/1 knows that the last thing he will ever give up is his magazine and radio broadcasts. The ability to make speeches and have them printed and see his picture reproduced is the top requirenent in his makeup. The next nost izpor- tart recirement is the capability to travel and hob-nob with Heads of State and other intenst which he excels. These two attributes are of considerable to A, as witness the fact that fr. Fitzgerald has insisted on retaining these capabilities for A/1 to use in behalf of the Agency. They are certainly nore important to him than money, as such, concerning which he is incredibly naive and disinterested. He is notorious for having to have somebody else go around with him to be sure he has necessary documents and money, otherwise he would never have a dime in his pocket. I checked further on this point with A4 at our last meeting on 27 June and he said there was no evidence of 1/1 pilfering the till, the problem if any was simply honest mismaragement. We should remember that I has been paid a salary, with Hos agreement and at our suggestion for that matter, of $1,000 a month. ANNORLD/2 zade it a point to deposit the check in A/1's personal account every month, and A/2 maintained de facto control of the account. A/1 told me this incident because he was amazed to find when A/2 left for Spain and turned the records of the account over tol/l, he found that he had 4o 5 thousand dollars in the bank, the most he had ever owned in his life. In addition to this salxary, it should be remembered that A/1 is a co-author of the "Bay of Pigs boold, which was worth several thousand dollars to each of the a co-authors.

Note: This line of reporting has been going on for at least the past 2 years in the case of A/1 and is typical of the incessant gossip and character assassination within the Cuban exile community in Miami that has been going on for the last 5 years. While certainly no paragon of virtue or of efficiency, it will take more than this to convince me A/1 is a crook. In the first place, AlidAVA/4 would be the first one to put the finger on him if he started misappropriating MRR funds or otherwise playing games that would hurt the movement. In the second place, 1/1 ie too disorganized to be an effective crook, even if he tried, and it would show up in more concrete form than this report.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: Present Activities and Possible Future Plans of Manuel Artime Buena

## 1. Present Activities:

During the past six weeks Manuel Artime has devoted his time to the task of disbanding his paramilitary establishment in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Artime has returned most of the arms and equipment provided him by this Agency. This includes the mother-ship, nearly all of the heavy weapons such as mortars, machine guns and artillery pieces, as well as other miscellaneous items such as communications vans and earth-moving equipment. The small arms not recovered from Artime are sufficient to equip an infantry company.

## 2. Future Plans:

During the same period Artime has attempted to gain support for a plan by which he, and a small nucleus of his paramilitary force, would conduct counterinsurgency-type operations against Castro-supported rebel bands operating in several Latin American countries. Artime has outlined these proposals to Presidents Leoni Valencia of Colombia and Marcos Robles of Panama, and endeavored to obtain an interview with Raul Leoni of Venezuela, but has been able to conduct conversations on this proposal only on the Venezuelan Cabinet level.

To implement such a scheme Artime envisions using a small group of highly-trained individuals plus

SECRET

Two fast motor launches criginally provided to him by this Agency. Artims would use this force to patrol the coasts of one or the other of the aforementioned countries to prevent the smuggling of arms and/or general contraband. in exchange for this service, Artime would receive the permission of these governments to keep any aras which he might capture in the course of those patrols. Ja addition, he would be allowed to maintain basen of operation from which to launch attacks against Cuba. So far none of these governments has made any commitment to Artise. He clains, however, that both Presidents Valencia and Robles have expressed interest in his pro- poralo.

Artine has requested en interview with this Agnacy, presumably to discuss his future, during which it is expected that he will bring up his schene as outlined above.

Artine would seek private financing from wealthy Cuban exiles and Latin American sympathisers.

Panama

Artine would start a "comandos rurales" operation, similar to that which was the base of MRR strength in rural Cuba.

Artine would launch a civic action program and also would interdict Cuban infiltration operations.

The above plan would be carried out mainly in Chiriqui Province.

Miscellaneous

We have no information on what Artime proposed in Venezuela but assume it is much the same as for Colombia and Panama. We also believe Artime may ask CIA to continue to assist him in radio broadcasting to Cuba, financing the MRR magazine, and helping him maintain continued contact with the Cubela group.

This would be in return for his counter insurgency program outlined above.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT: Proposed Meeting Between Chief, WH and AMBIDDY-1

1. AMBIDDY-1 went to Nicaragua on 11 May 1965 to remove his remaining men and equipment from that country and to complete secure storage arrangements for the small arms which he has retained. He has a meeting scheduled with General Peralta in Guatemala later this week and expects to be back in Miami by 17 May.

2. He hopes to meet with Chief, WH at any convenient time thereafter to report on the disbanding of ANWORLD and to discuss any other matters which may be of mutual interest. AMBIDDY-1 has indicated that he is willing to continue cooperating with the Agency by furnishing information and undertaking political action tasks as required. He hoped that the Agency, in turn, will be able to assist him in financing a limited publicity program consisting mainly of radio broadcasts and the MRR magazine. This would help to keep his movement alive and maintain him as a recognized exile leader who would thus be of continued value to the Agency in activities of mutual interest.

3. We suggest that his witting deputy, AMJAVA-4, might be invited to visit Washington at the same time to participate in other discussions concerning possible activities in the future. It would be appreciated if Chief, WH were able to get a convenient date for a meeting in order that we may notify AMBIDDY-1 in advance.

2. ANJAVA-4 also wishes to discuss the two job offers he has received from the Agency, ie, a job with Caracas Station, or to go into university level training in a holding capacity for future commitment to a post-Castro Cuban regime.

Meeting with ANJAVA-4 in New Orleans, 21-23 May 1965

Subject: AWBIDDY-1 Activities

1. ANJAV-4 said he had talked only briefly with AWBIDDY-1 on his return from Guatemala and Nicaragua (21 May, just before A-4 left to meet me in New Orleans). A-1 said he had talked with General Peralta in Guatemala and had disclaimed any connection with Roberto Alejos' coup plotting or the former MRR Cubans who had been involved with it. He had also outlined his proposal for Peralta to consider whereby A-1 and the MRR would undertake, at the invitation of the local government, to assist in countering Castro/Communist infiltration and subversion, and to help develop rural civic action programs as a positive counter-insurgency program. A-1 claimed that Peralta seemed very seriously interested in the proposals and appeared quite appreciative that A-1 had been able to visit him. A-1 expects that Peralta will wish to talk to him further in regard to his counter-insurgency proposals.

2. A-1 also talked again with President Schick in Nicaragua about the above proposal. Schick had thought over their previous discussion and approves a pilot program to be run on the east coast, with the rural civic action program near Bluefields. This will allow A-1 to keep a few of his men in the country to work on the program while maintaining security of the weapons he has stored there. A-1 also talked with Luis Somoza, at the latter's invitation, but indicated there was nothing new or interesting from this source.

3. A-4 is not sure himself how much A-1 has been able to accomplish in his visits in Central and South America, and how much of his reporting is wishful thinking. He is not ready, however, to call A-1 short and has watched him "rolling ice-boxes to Eskimos" successfully over too long a period of time.

3 June 1965

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/PO/B

ATTENTION: Mr. J. De Stefano

SUBJECT: Background Sketch on Dr. Manuel Artime Buesa

1. Manuel Artime Buesa, a non-practicing medical doctor, began his political activities in Cuba during the year 1959 when he participated in the formation of a civic action type program known as the "Comandos Rurales." The Comandos Rurales actively participated with the Castro regime during its initial agrarian reform, but eventually broke with it due to Castro's shift to Marxism-Leninism. It was at this point that Artime formed the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for the Recovery of the Revolution), a political organization which he heads to date. The degree of Artime's activities in the civic action program was reflected by the fact that Artime, prior to his break with Castro, had been appointed a deputy in the Instituto Nacional de la Refora Agragaria (INRA) for Oriente Province. Artime's first contact with the Agency took place just prior to his open break with Castro and he was exfiltrated from the island by the Agency. Artime dedicated himself to the continued development of the MRR until called upon by the Agency to be the political representative for the Cuban Brigade 2506 which landed at the Bay of Pigs. Artime was captured and sentenced to be executed. This was later commuted by Castro to life imprisonment. In 1962 Artime was among those repatriated to this country under the prisoner exchange.

2. In mid-1963 the Agency again asked Artime to head an autonomous paramilitary organization made up and trained exclusively by Cubans and funded by the Agency. Subject set

up a series of training camps in Central America. Using the political banner of the MRR Artime's group conducted several paramilitary operations against the island of Cuba with varying degrees of success. In early 1965 by order of the 303 Committee it was decided to phase out the Agency's support to Artime since it was felt that paramilitary operations against Cuba were futile and ineffective. Although he disagreed with this decision, Artime has been fully cooperative in disbanding his organization. The paramilitary wing of the MRR is now completely disbanded, and a few political representatives remain in Central America and Florida.

3. Subject is currently attempting to re-enlist the Agency's support in order to keep his political organization intact. If approved by the 303 Committee, Artime's MRR will receive a small subsidy. Artime also plans to establish a civic action program along the lines of the Comandos Rurales in various Central and South American countries. In such an endeavor Artime would be strictly on his own without any support from the Agency.

4. It is in order to discuss this future program that Artime is anxious to meet with Mr. George C. Lodge, Jr. The undersigned, who is subject's current case officer, is ready and willing to contact Mr. Lodge directly and travel to Cambridge should this be useful. Artime permanently resides in Miami, Florida and his telephone number is: (305) 754-8144.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, WHD/C

SUBJECT : Support for Manuel Artime and the MRR for the month of June 1965

1. On the basis of the discussion on 27 May between Chief, WH and Manuel Artime, we are currently in the process of submitting a recommendation to the 303 Committee that we maintain contact with Artime and render support to him on a modest basis. His monthly operating budget, which he submitted to us, would enable him to keep the MRR alive as a recognized exile political organization, and would allow him, personally, to maintain his status as an important exile leader. This would, in turn, continue his access to heads of state and other leading political figures in Latin America.

2. Pending action by the 303 Committee, it is recommended that you grant approval to fund Artime and the MRR for the month of June 1965, on the basis of the following budget estimate:

a. MRR delegates

Spain $ 500
Honduras 350
Guatemala 350
Colombia 400
Costa Rica 350
Venezuela 450
HQS office expenses 800

b. Publishing costs of MRR magazine "Tridente" $ 3,200

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Contact of Manuel Artime with Professor George Lodge and with Col. Barrientos of Bolivia

1. I talked with Manuel Artime by phone the night of 4 June. He said he had received a call from Professor Lodge that afternoon but was not at home to talk with him. (This was obviously a follow-up from the offer made to Artime by Chief, WH to put him and Lodge together on his proposed civic action activities.) I told him there was no reason he should not return the call and arrange for a meeting with Lodge at their mutual convenience.

2. Artime said that was his first reaction, but before he could make the call another message had come in from Col. Barrientos of Bolivia asking if he could visit the country for the benefit of his advice and counsel and offering to send a Bolivian Air Force plane to pick him up and bring him to La Paz. I asked if he were acquainted with Barrientos or an expert on Bolivia and he said he knew no more about either of them than what he had read in the papers. He had no idea of the reason for the invitation, but wanted to check with us and find out if we had any requirements for him in case we wanted him to make the visit. I told him I would check with Chief, WH next morning and call him back.

3. On the morning of 5 June I called Artime. He said Professor Lodge had called him at 0700 that morning and told him he was interested in getting together with him. Lodge said he would be in Panama on 14 June, and Artime said he planned to be travelling in that area at that time and could easily meet him there. Artime told Lodge he was willing to make a trip to Boston to see him earlier and that after such a preliminary meeting, the next meeting in Panama would probably be more useful. Lodge seemed delighted and invited Artime

to lunch with his on 9 June. I suggested to Artise that he plan to meet Lodge on 9 June, stop in Kashington on the vay home where I could meet with him (and furnish him a briefing on Bolivia which he desperately requested). I suggested he send a message to Barrientos saying he could be in Panama on 11 June and could see Barrientos as soon thereafter as transportation could be arranged. (Artime has a visit with President Robles of Panama scheduled about that time and can work it in, together with the meeting with Lodge on 14 June in Panama.)

4. Artime said he had found out the background of the invitation from Barrientos. One of Barrientos' trusted aides had been to Washington or New York and in passing through Miami enroute home heard a MRR radio broadcast about countering subversion, civic action, etc. that attracted his attention. There was also a brief analysis of the situation in Bolivia which appealed to him as the best-balanced hehad heard. He thereupon started asking questions about the MRR and Artime and was referred to one of Artime's people who turned over some copies of "Tridente" (magazine of the MRR). The aide remarked that he was going to report to Barrientos of his discovery of a Cuban exile group that seemed knowledgeable of Castro and Communist subversion operations and had some useful ideas of how to.. counter them. Two days later Artime received the invitation from Barrientos.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief, WH

FROM: Chief of Station, JYWAVE

SUBJECT: Operational/TYPIC/AXXORLD/AMOT Activities in AMWORLD and of AMBIDDY-1

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required: None. For Your Information.

1.  The AMOTs have recently submitted two short reports providing some information about ANWORLD and AMBIDDY-1 activities.

2.  AMOT-84 reported the following in Report DD-1414, 19 May 1965, which he had acquired from Iden A, whose ultimate source of information was AMWORLD-2:

a. AMWORLD-2 left for New York with his family on 15 May 1965, this being his first step towards disconnecting himself from AMWORLD. Before he left, he handed over to AMBIDDY-1 the AMWORLD money which he had in the bank.

b. AMWORLD-2 said that AMBIDDY-1 was devoting all his attention to obtaining money by the sale of military equipment which he had at the camps. AMBIDDY-1 had already realized U.S. $30,000 in this manner and hoped to raise still another $30,000. AMBIDDY-1 currently had all the AMWORLD money under his absolute control and said he intended to act as treasurer of the organization.

c. AMBIDDY-1 gave the impression of not being involved with any political plan. Occasionally he talked to friends about interviews with his "contacts" and about a budget for propaganda. Other times he gave consideration to propositions of friends, such as the Spaniard who acts as his chauffeur and secretary, concerning various business deals. He also talks of buying a farm in Nicaragua to cultivate rice, etc.

d. The general opinion within AMWORLD is that the organization is entering a crisis and, with the separation of AMWORLD-2 from the organization, ANWORLD members would no longer continue to receive their salaries.

3. In AMOT Report EE-1438, 4 June 1964, AVOT-84 further reported information he had received from Iden A, as follows:

a. Iden B said that AMBIDDY-1 vas only concerned with maintaining the small AMWORLD camp in Nicaragua, where there were weapons, ammunition, and seven men, who were there without the knowledge of the ODYOKERS. Iden B said that AMBIDDY-1 was awaiting an opportune moment to arm as many friends as possible and leave for PBRUMEN.

b. Iden C said that there really were arms and ammunition cached in the camp in Nicaragua, but that the seven men there spent all their time looking for persons to buy the arms and ammunition.

c. Iden C also said he believed that if AMBIDDY-1 was keeping up his radio transmissions and payments to some journalists it was because they served as a cover for his commercial operations and that all the propaganda would disappear when AMBIDDY-1 had to use AMWORLD money to keep up the propaganda.

Re: Manuel Artime

June 9

In general, Artime impressed me greatly and we got along very well. He is energetic, idealistic, enthusiastic, highly motivated and in my judgement well suited in every way to the task he intends to perform. As you know, he is 33 years old, tough-minded and filled with ideological fire. His weakness would appear to be a certain lack of focus and conceptualization. He does not really have a plan but appears to be reacting to immediate crises and opportunities like a fire fighter. He and his group, therefore, need careful and thoughtful leadership and guidance to get the most out of them and to deal with problems in the proper order of priority and urgency.

He arrived late at the Business School because the taxi driver got lost. We had a quick lunch together which I had to leave early in order to be in class at 1:30. At my request he joined me in the classroom. I was giving a lecture on the role of the manager in the midst of radical change to a group of alumni who are at the School for a short seminar on international business problems. During the discussion period he spoke well and with great conviction about his work in the hills with Castro and the Cuban problem in general. He made an excellent impression.

We then talked in my office for 1½ hours. A summary of the conversation follows:

He told me of his work with the Indians on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua where he has 5 men working on community development problems including health, education, road building, rice marketing and boat building. He has 10 men at his base of operations on the coast. He mentioned that he knew Enrique Pereira, a young manager in Managua closely associated with INCAE and in my judgement a good, active, properly oriented young man.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

time .... 2

He discussed his civic action training program in Miami which has just started and in which he said he has 32 men enrolled. This is a 3-month program to prepare men for rural organization work of various kinds. He spoke of his need for help in with respective to cooperative training and especially cooperative leadership selection and preparation.

He spoke of his conversation with the Col. Peralta in Guatemala and said that after a four-day field trip he reported to the President that:

a. The Army was old fashioned, had poor ideas and as ill equipped to fight guerilla warfare or to carry out the civic action program which were urgently necessary.

b. He said he found serious subversion among the Indians largely through small radios which Cuban trained Guatemalans were giving to the Indians and which were tuned in on Radio Cuba only. He knew specifically of 5 Guatemalans engaged in this work..

c. He spoke of the danger of Sosa in the mountains and said that Peralta showed his ignorance by brushing Sosa off as a small-time operator with only a handful of men around him. Artime said he had about 25 men with him and added that this was enough to start a lot of trouble. He said he would like to begin something in Guatemala but had no specific suggestions.

He said he had 3 people working in San Jose, Costa Rica, inside what he referred to as "the Cuban community."

He has one man in Colombia organising three cooperativos in the Cali area at the request of a local Senator who owns a sugar mill and the Cali newspaper and who Artime described as a very good man. He is deeply concerned about the situation in Colombia.

He is leaving shortly for Bolivia where he has been invited to spend four days by the President.

During the course of the conversation I made the following suggestions which met with his enthusiastic approvals


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

Artime ... 3

I believe his key contribution may be in the area of rural organization and motivation. He and his men (he said he has 220 available for imediate action) need rural organisation training. Only a few know much about it. I suggested therefore he investigate the cooperative training school at Antigonish, Nova Scotia, which from everything I have been able to find out in Parama and elsewhere is the best thing of its kind in the world. He said he had heared of it very favorably and mentioned he would talk with a Bishop friend of his and see if he could get some of his wen enrolled in the school immediately.

I told him in some detail of our work in Veraguas Province and of Bishop HoGrath's general development plans and also of the Bishop's intention to establish a cooperative training center in Veraquas. I mentioned the possibility of one or two of his men working in Veraguas alongside my men who will be there this summer and thereafter. He was extremely enthusiastic about this and suggested Nestor Isquierdo, a 29-year-old Cuban Negro whom he said had done rural organization work with him in Cuba. He spose very highly of him. My thought was that perhaps *Isquierdo might join my men during the summer with Bishop McGrath's approval, work on our cooperative project there and perhaps remain to help the Bishop set up his training center and carry on such other activities as might be useful. Isquierdo is apparently very versatile in his talents. He might go to Antigonish somewhere along the way if that spemsi wise. We left it that I would see how the Veraguas projeci goes, would talk informally to the Bishop and would meet Artime and possibly Jaquierdo in San Salvador on August 5. it that time we would decide whether it would be wise for Artime and/or Izquierdo to come with me to Veraguas.

He asked me to send him some books about chicken raising in Central America. Could you take care of this?

He gave me his address as 1270 NE 85th Street, Miami, and telephone as 754-8144.

All in all, I was deeply impressed by Artime and would like to work with hime

Dear Andy:

I have just come back from a three-day visit to Veraguas where things are going along very well. There are now 9 small cooperatives in the region around Santiago. In the village of San Francisco a large training center is under construction which will house 60 persons for cooperative training courses and for other teaching in rural development. There is dormitory as well as classroom space. The building was financed as follows: $12,000 from the German Bishops, $6500 from the community of San Francisco itself (pop.1000), which is really quite remarkable and testimony to the truly unique and effective operations which the Bishop and his associates are creating in Veraguas and $9000 is being raised in Panama. This Center will be where Father Steele will conduct regular four-month cooperative and rural development training courses for persons from all over Latin America. It will also be used for local training. Father Steele's last course was held in Panama city and was attended by 25 men from Ecuador, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Panama. This course seems to be the best of its kind in Latin America.

The land has finally been broken free around San Jose: this is the first real land reform in Panama. My two men are hard at work.

I talked to the Bishop about Nestor and he was most enthusiastic. He wants him to come as soon as possible and work alongside Oswaldo Rodrigues who is the young man in charge of his development operations. His organization is called CEPAS, Center for Studies, Promotion and Social Assistance. He hopes that Nestor will be able to be the executive director and operator of the San Francisco Center under construction. In my view this would be an ideal set-up. Best wishes.

would be in at the beginning of this effort which could have affects throughout Latin America. He would be learning and also teasing.

The Bishop suggested that he could use another men as well and further suggested that four of Nestor's friends from Miami might want to come and take Father Steelés course in January at San Francisco. It costs about $60 a month, including everything.

The Bishop knew Manuel, having met him in Chicago at some meeting, and he has the highest record for him. He suggested that he could meet Manuel and Nestor in Miami on June 28 when he will be there staying with his father-in-law step-father, Col. Harry Scheibla. 6491 Allison Island Rd., Miami Beach. I called Manuel and he and Nestor will see the Bishop on the morning of June 28. I told the Bishop that financing for Nestor could be arranged, suggesting possibly the Panax but making nothing definite. I suggest that if all this meets with your approval you may wish to contact Manuel and/or Nestor and pin down the financial part of it. I would suggest that Nestor be paid about $200 a month. That is what Oswaldo Rodrigues gets. Incidentally this Oswaldo is really first class - a good man to watch. You may want to just let things go as they are but in any case the Bishop expects Nestor to be financed somehow.

I am off to Colombia tomorrow.

All the best.

# Meetings with AMJAVA-4 in Washington, 27-28 June 1965

Subject: Proposed Agency Programs

1. Following the demise of AMWORLD, AMJAVA-4 has become familiar with three other Agency programs, or proposed programs, and he asked if he could have some clarification as to just what we wanted from him and his people. I explained that there were three different functions which needed to be done and that the Agency was trying to develop programs to meet each need. The three functions concerning Cuba are:

(a) to maintain the MRR as a respected resistance organization with a political posture which is acceptable to most Cubans and not inimical to U.S. interests. We are asking approval of a minimum budget for subsidy of the MRR which will pay for its published and radio publicity matter, subsistence to survivors of MRR killed, disabled, or captured, and travel expenses for AMBIDDY-1 as the leader of the movement outside Cuba. We are trying to guide A-l into a program of Community Development/Civic Action projects in Latin America as a means of projecting an image of the MRR and of A-l as constructive, forward-looking people instead of simply exile counterrevolutionaries. We would hope that such activities would keep the movement together, give the members practical experience which would eventually be useful in Cuba, and in the meantime, would render useful results in countering problems of insurgency in Latin America.

(b) to prepare a managerial and executive team of specially selected Cuban exiles who would be ready to move into Cuba should relations be resumed with the United States in order to furnish effective direction of necessary governmental functions and assist the United States in denying the island to Communist control. Selected candidates would, hopefully, be fairly young as well as intelligent and capable of profiting from extensive training programs which would be designed for each to prepare him to perform a specific function in a future Cuban regime. The program would be apolitical, each person being considered as an individual and not as representative of any organization. This is the program for which A-4 is being considered for training in the field of internal security for work with the Agency in a post-Castro Cuban régime.

2. (a) to select and maintain a small cadre of Cuban exile paramilitary people who would be ready for emergency contingency

situations anywhere in the world on short notice and for short periods of time. When not mobilized, the Agency would asaälst then inmaintaining employment and supporting themselves. they would also, of course, be available for emergency operational commitment to Cuba if required. (It was explained that this was the program handled by Mr. Ton Clines of SOD, who was present and discussed it more in detail with A-4.)

2. A-4 understood that the programs outlined above wore only parts of an overall concept concering Cuba, that the first vas designed to meet long-term political considerations, the second at meet long-term strategic requirements, and the third to meet current operational needs. He understood and completely agreed with each program, and agreed to cooperate in executing each of them, to the maximum of his ability. He will be happy to spot and recruit for us in each program, and will try to influence AMBIDDY-1 along the lines we want him to follow. A-4 appreciated ou explanations and stated that he could be much more helpful to us now that he understood what we were trying to accomplish.

For Andy, Bill and others:

I just spoke with Bishop McGrath who saw Art in Miami last Wednesday afternoon. Art was accompanied by a man named Pogo (sp?), who the Bishop said had come from Boston. Nestor was not there.

After a lengthy conversation, the Bishop said that he and Art agreed that the man to follow would be to send from a pool of Art’s younger men to Father Steele’s cooperative-community development training course which will be held in San Francisco. Very roughly around January 15. At the end of the course, which I believe runs four months, the Bishop could then pick one or two of the men to remain and work with him and his group. The Bishop was concerned about having someone with his project who was too closely connected with IRR Art. He felt and he said Art did too that probably both Art and Pogo were too well known as associates of Antin. That is why he decided on younger men who are less identified.

The Bishop said he made some discreet inquiries about Art among “friends” of his in Miami and found that he and once been the fair-haired and much admired leader of young Cubans, but that in America he had had a love affair with the wife of one of Batista’s, which sort of took some of the gloss off as far as his followers were concerned. The Bishop said he has since married the women and is working his way back to a position of respectability. They liked him a lot and he said they got along very well.

It sounds to me as though this is a very good plan and could lead to something of long-term value.

Genros.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Activities of AMBIDDY-1, 1-10 July 1965

1.  I talked to AMBIDDY-1 by telephone on 2, 8 and 10 July with the gist of the conversations outlined below:

a.  AMBIDDY-1 had two long conversations with Bishop McGrath of Panama on 30 June and 2 July. They discussed the center for studies of rural cooperatives at San Francisco village in Veraguas Province, Panama, that is being developed under the Bishop's auspices with support from Harvard University and which has two men there at present. Prof. George Lodge is the Harvard representative and has been visiting the center. A-1 received a letter fron Prof. Lodge asking for assignment of an experienced man to the staff of the center. Bishop McGrath repeated the request, saying he would like to have two men as soon as possible, with a total of six by January when he plans to increase the program. The two men selected. were Silvano POZO Carrillo (201-73977 and Nestor IZQUIERDO Diaz (201-281933) both Negroes from Oriente Province and former Comandos Rurales. A-l asked the Bishop what part the Panama Government played and was told they approved, although they were not directly involved. A-1 understands that the center will train students from all over Latin America and has already graduated more than twenty students from several countries.

b. The five man security force left by A-l at Monkey Point, Nicaragua, in addition to guarding a weapons cache, continues to teach the local Indians in reading, wring, basic operation and maintenance of machinery, and rice planting.

c. The community development/civic action training program for MRR members which A-l has been running in the evenings in Miami is about half finished. He has about twenty men attending regularly after work with several others attending whenever/they can get away from their jobs. The

class is now studying organization of rural cooperatives. Silvano POZO is chief instructor for this phase and will be sent to Panama as soon as the classes in Miami are completed.

d. A-1 has bought a small farm (22 acres) near West Palm Beach to develop as a model farm for his training program. He is installing generators, water pumps, and starting to raise chickens, etc. He hopes eventually to bring a few students at a time from Latin America as his program progresses to show then what can be done with small plots if proper farming techniques are used.

e. A-1 received another message from Bolivia saying in effect that the situation was still about the same and again asking if he were able to visit there. He stalled them again (at our request) and agreed to be out of town or otherwise scheduled until the matter dies a natural death.

2. The West German Government has issued scholarships paying all tuition plus $100 per month subsistence in German universities to three of A-l's people who have been living in Spain. They will go to Germany in August to study the language for six months then begin their studies. They are Angel LAVANDERA, economics; Carlos MAYO, engineering; and Luis CAVADA, engineering. This is follow-up to the meeting A-l had in Rome with the German Ambassador that was arranged for him by the Vatican Secretary of State last December.

3. A-1 is leaving 13 or 14 July for about 10 to 15 days visiting Central America. He will go to Nicaragua first to talk with President Schick and General Somoza, then to Monkey Point to check on the condition of the base, security of the arms he has cached there, and to observe the civic action training his men there are conducting for the local Indians. He will then go to Costa Rica to talk with President Orlich and Foreign Minister Oduber who have sent werd they would like to meet with him as soon as convenient for him. From there he will go to Panama to see President Marcos Robles, who has been expecting him for several weeks. A-l will describe the project he is about to enter with Bishop McGrath and Professor Lodge and confirm President Robles' attitude toward it. A-l will also visit Veraguas Province and look over the training centor.

4. I also informed A-1 that his proposal to maintain

survivors of MRR people, for delegates, the Tridente, and radio broadcasting had been approved for $12,000 monthly. He was gratified to receive continued support for the movement. I told him we would try to get the July payment into the bank through the old AMWORLD funding mechanism pending development of a new funding system.

## INTRODUCTION

This industrial development plan is presented by the INVERNICA company located in the city of Managua, D.J. (Naval District), Nicaragua.

This report is part of the preliminary study which INVERNICA has effected in regard to an investment program for the concentration of repair yards and shipyards in the Bluff-Bluefields area.

These facilities will provide complete service to the fishing fleets and other boats which operate on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. The initial cost of building these facilities, with their necessary complex operational sections, is staggering. This cost, however, will be significantly reduced because of the equipment, experience and personnel of INVERNICA.

This study analyzes the various elements of investment which totals US$ 237,000 of which I:VERNICA is contributing 68.4 percent and INFONAC 51.6 percent.

Because of its status as a new industry in the country and the benefits which would accrue to the national economy, this plan may be classified as fundamental industry (Law Nr 135, Law of Protection and Stimulation for the Development of Industry, 20 March 1958) and, therefore enjoy this protection and stimulation for its full initial development.

As will be seen in this preliminary report, the necessity of modern shipyards and repair yards on the Atlantic coast is of vital importance to the survival of the fishing fleets. These fleets suffer serious operational restrictions because of the absence of such services which are common to the North American and Mexican fleets. We have the necessary equipment and technical personnel, and, moreover, the full con-

## ANALYSIS OF THE MARKET

The primary function of the shipyard will be the construction of 20-200-ton boats some steel and wood. This will include shrimpboats, lobsterboats, barges, light cargoships, and passenger and patrol launches.

The secondary function of the Combine will be to provide repair and maintenance service to all boats of this class within the Carribean of equal or better quality than that offered in Mexico, Trinidad or the United States.

To a degree, the shipyard will attempt specialisation in the construction of 35-ton shrimpboats for favorable competition in the world market. Construction will be attempted from steel and from wood.

Construction from wood will be advantageous because of the procurement of wood in large part, if not all, from the local sawmills in Bluefields.

Another advantage of construction from wood is a plan for mass production in which prefabricated sections of boats will be constructed. It is possible to visualise in the near future not only the sale of fully-equipped shrimpboats but also prefabricated parts for those shipyards which do not have the necessary machinery, wood, and other items.

The Domestic and Central American Market: There are only a few countries in America which possess the facilities for construction of boats with the shrimpboat draft.

These countries are Peru, Mexico and the United States. The production in Peru is small and relatively insignificant, and its influence in the Carribbean is nil. Mexican boats are constructed from good material, but because of poor workmanship together with antiquated designs, they are subject to enormous structural fatigue in heavy seas. In the United States the production of shrimpboats is limited.

By five main companies become at an average rate of five boats per shipyard. They are excellent products with the latest fishing and navigation equipment. Nevertheless, they are costly because of the high cost of labor and raw materials in the country. Since we possess most of the wood in Bluefields, trained and competent personnel, and a superior funcional boat design, we will be able to supply the necessities for a national fishing fleet, as well as to place these boats on the world market. We base this opinion on preliminary calculations which prove the possibility of our ability to produce an excellent boat at less cost and superior to the North American boats.

## Domestic Market

The national market: The immediate market for our shrimpboats is the domestic national fleets. The Booth Fisheries express great interest in procuring additional boats as soon as possible. It plans possible expansion to 20 more boats in the next two or three years. There is also the possibility of renting or selling these boats on terms to local individuals captaincies, as well as of stimulating investments by other domestic national capital. We estimate a national market of some 25 shrimpboats in the next three years.

The demand from the rest of the Carribean [sic] can be conservatively estimated at 40 boats, totalling 75 boats, which they will purchase in/from Mexico and the United States. With our production of 15 boats during this three-year period, it is evident that we possess a rich market here in the Caribean area, not to mention the demand forthcoming from the Pacific and other large fishing areas.

As regards the repair yard, we estimate servicing 400 boats annually with our modern installations. Compare this with the repair yard services of Schooner Key which is offering partial services to 45 boats annually.

# CONFIDENTIAL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 82

The plans for the Ficaraguan shrisyboat fleet this year call for 80 boats. A11 40 coastal boats of all types and the total comes to 120 boats which will require repair yard services four times per year(3 beanings normal maintenance and A emergency), that is, a total of 480 groundings annually. The local repair ya-ds are able to service only 100 groundings.

This situation de forcef many shrimpboats to seek repairs outside of the country, either at Honduras, Mexico or the United States resultant less of fishing time and for Hicaragua.

INITIAL

Technical Lisitations: The lack of local technical personnel, and time required to import various mechanical parts and materials.

Consideration for future expansion was taken ixts in designing the shipyard and repair yard. Carpentry and mechanic workshops alse planned. There are twe factors hywever which affect the overall operation. The first factor is the lack of personnel trained in steel construction of boats, but this will be overcome initially by personnel trained by the Company. The second factor will be resolved only by an eficient coordination with the distribution and supply persone nel of the Company in Hiasi. In this way it will be possible to have any spare parts or mtériab forwarded to Bluff within two weeks after the request is made by the local offices, (via airlène). Furthermore, plans have been prepared to stock the shipyard with spare parts.

External or Internal Competition: As regards theshipyard, there is neither external nor internal competition in Central America. The only competition we will encounter will be Mexican and Nerth American, The following is a comparative study of this competitions

(b) Quality of Materials.

Mexico: Good materials; Bad design and construction.

U.S.A.: Good materials; excellent designs; construction depends on the Company and varies from good to excellent.

Nicaragua: Good materials; excellent designs and construction.

(c) Channels and Policy of Distribution: Eventhough it will be difficult to compete initially in sales in the Mexican and North American markets, because of their high duties, we will unjey/unlimited market in the rest of the Carribean. We will compete favorably due to the excellent position of Nicaragua with respect to Central American, Venesuelan, Colombian, and other markets.

As regards the repair yard, it is to be noted that the foreign repair yards are much expensive less than the domestic ones, sometimes up to 500 percent. From the study of typical costs of each repair yard we conclude that we are able to offer more service at equal or less cost. The following examples assume a typical beaching grounding of three days, cleaning, caulking, straightening the shaft, changing a number of shots of metal, tightening the framework or sternpests, securement of the rudder and botten, and finally, the paints

SOCIO-ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION

Employment in the first year of production, 16 men will be employed by the Enterprise, and assigned as follows:

Administration Personnel: 4 employees (one administrator and public accountant), one office assistant, and two managers of services and maintenance).

Carpentry Meech: 7 employees (one chief of carpentry, three ship-carpenters, two carpenter assistants).

Mechanics: 5 employees (one chief of mechanics and lathe-shop, two specialist acchinios, and two mechanics assistants).

The initial wages of all employees of the Enterprise will be based on their technical knowledge, years of experience, etc. This pay scale will surpass the normal in order to attract the best possible personnel to the Enterprise. A plan for increase of fixed and meritorious wages is also being planned as an incentive for the employees.

The number of personnel is expected to increase to 20 in the second

year of production, and to 22 in the third year.

#### Bank in the Balance of Payments:
The shrimpboat fleets in Nicaragua have expanded from 10 to 15 boats annually. These boats are bought entirely equipped from Mexico and the United States. Their total value within a period of three years extends from a minimum of US$ 900,000 to a maximum of US$ 2,025,000. Our production during this period will be 14 shrimpboats at a value of US$ 560, 000 which will remain in the country.

Consumer Benefits and Economic Development: At present, most of the shrimp boats in the area have no facilities for mechanical repairs, and, in most cases, no facilities for grounding. This is due in part to the shallow draft of the inefficient marine railways in the local repair yards, as well as to antiquated equipment. Because of these difficulties, many shrimpboats are forced to put into Honduras, Mexico and at times the United States for repairs.

It is difficult to estimate with certainty the total losses which these boats incur through urgent negotiations for entry to and departure from other countries, fuel and personnel expenses, and, of more importance, the incalculable losses in fishing time. Inasmuchas our repair yards will possess a greater capability than normally required, those boats with emergency and other types of damages will guarantee service. In this way we will attract to our repair yards those boats which ordinarily would seek repairs outside of the country with the subsequent loss in foreign profits and valuable time fishing time in the waters of Nicaragua.

Protection and Incentives: Because of the characteristics of key Industry (See Law Nr 135, of 20 March 1958), a shipyard may request governmental aid during the first six years of its development in order to assure the necessary investments required by an enterprise of such complexity and magnitude. The necessary negotiations are presently being undertaken in Managua to obtain for this.

## TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

Designs have already been drafted for the first model in wood of a 35-ton shrimpboat, and for the first model in steel of a 30-ton shrimp-boat. The general specifications for the steel boat are the following: tonnage - 30; length - 62 feet; breadth - 20 feet; draught - 8 feet; keel (bar/steel-3) 3/4 inch x 8 inches; transverse frames (plate/steel); deck 3/16 inch (plate/steel). Paints Hart and Burns, Bond Primer, Anticorrosive and antifouling - a total of six coats. Refrigerator: capacity 20 tons, in shrimp-ice, constructed of styrofoam-concrete. Driving power plant: D-342 Caterpillar with supercharger. Propellers, 48 inches x 34 inches, with three Michigan blades. stainless steel propeller transmission shaft, 3 inches x 14 feet. GMD in-line winch. Eight 8-volt batteries with battery charger. Kerosene cooking-range. Searchlights and navigational lights. RCA Cruisephone 160. Ritchie, magnetic compass, model B453. Raytheon fathometer, model DE-724. Special fuel tanks in the hull, with capacity of 6,000 gals, Potable water tank, with capacity of 750 gals, etc.

Production Process: The processes in constructing boats and the services required for the boats are necessarily complex, although the processes are immensely simplified by new methods. Below is a description of the processes to be followed in the shipyard and in the repair yard. The construction of a boat begins with the laying of the keel on the slipway, followed by the attachment of the transverse framework to the keel. The crossbeams

and sternpost are then set in place after the framework is cut to sise.
The shall plating is nert attached from tae keel upwards in a such a ner that upen entering the water the wood undergoes a precalculated expansion which coupletely seals the ball without ascessitating calking. A hole is drilled for the shaft and the supports and pis for the redder are then set in place. Following this is the flooring for the deck and Exa the steel

process for the construction of a boat from steel is a simpler mtter, and therefore less costi.

The normal process of drydock-repair service for a boat is as follows: The cradle(See diagrams Ers 1 and 3) awaits the bost at the entrance of the ramp. With the use of mane-avering-busys, the boat is lifted ente the cradle where it is made stationary with transverse beams. The moving cradle is brought up the ramp and the boat is then transferred from it to a lateral cradle. The beat is brought to Section Nr 1 where it is immediately scraped with electric portabće brushes and high water pressure. While the holes.

After drying the ball is calked and a general inspection is made.
Paint is applied, and while that is drying the necessary interior mechanical vork is carried out. Upon termination of the final painting and a final inspection, the hoat is launched. The complete operation lasts no more than two er three days in a modern drydock, and the support personnel consist of twe

carpenters, a mechanic, and twe yard assistants, as well as the usual repair and spare parts.

Installations: As can be seen fren diagras ar 1, the area eccupied by the shipyard is relatively small, some 15.500 square meters. It consists of a reinforced-concrete ramp with 4-inch rail, and an area 150 meters long by 20 meters. The has a depth of 7 meters. The Central Yard contains a lateral cradle (25 x 17 x 1 meters), which rolls on a concrete base(al? x 25 x 1 meters); three sections of the cradle (42 x 20 meters) with the third section terminating near the shipbuilding shed (33 x 22 x 11 meters). Two identical buildings are planned for the machine shops, carpentry offices and warehouses, on a total working area of 1200 square meters. A building will house two 75-kilowatt electric power plants, spare parts and general electrical equipment. A 350-gallon underground petroleum tank will be installed along side of this building to provide the fuel. A 6,000-gallon fresh-water tank with its well and turbine will complete the first phase of the plan. The second phase will be carried out during the year of production.

Cost of Each Section (Approx):

Retention Wall and Filling in the Swamp $ 1,500

Ramp $ 4,000

Central Yard $ 10,000

Base for the Lateral Cradle $ 5.000

Buildings for Workshops/Warehouses/Offices $ 12,000

Building for Ship Construction $ 3,000

Building for the Power Plants $ 2,000

## APPENDIX

A re-study of the necessities of the shipyard, of the extensive (and intensive) repairs which the fleets will require, and of the immense volume of maintenance, has revealed the enormous load which the shop and carpentry must bear.

With the capital available to INTERNICA at this time, only US$ 25,000 can be channeled to these workshops,

US$ 6,500 in equipment in our possession), the present emphasis is placed on construction and immediate production. Nevertheless, I believe that an additional investment in the workshops is of vital importance for less costlies and efficient production. For production the shipyard, naturally, requires sophisticated equipment, a significant volume of spare parts and additional capital.

We may choose to purchase this equipment with the first year's profits. But I believe that this sum be incorporated into the plan of initial loans, requested by the enterprise.

# INTRODUCCIÓN

Este proyecto de desarrollo industrial lo presenta la Compañía INVERSICA (Inversiones Rivera urbanas), ubicada en la ciudad de Managua, D.N., Nicaragua.

El contenido de este informe forma parte del estudio preliminar que ha efectuado la INVERSICA en torno a un programa de inversión de un concentrado de astilleros - varaderos en el área del Bluff - Bluefields. Dichas facilidades estarán orientadas a dar servicios completos a las flotas pesqueras y demás embarcaciones que operan en la Costa Atlántica de Nicaragua. Dada la complejidad de las operaciones requeridas en los trabajos y servicios de un astillero, el costo del monto de dichas facilidades es inicialmente elevado. Gracias a los equipos, experiencia y personal técnico que posee la INVERSICA, éste costo inicial se reduce enormemente. Este estudio analiza los diferentes elementos que forman parte de dicha inversión y los integra a una cifra total, cuyo valor es de US$ 237,000.00 (DOSCIENTOS TREINTA Y SIETE MIL DÓLARES), con dos inversionistas: INVERNICA supliendo el 8.4% (ocho punto cuatro por ciento), y el INFOMAC supliendo el 31.6% (treinta y uno punto seis por ciento).

Ya por su condición de industria nueva en país, y del alto beneficio que ello conlleva a la economía nacional, este proyecto puede clasificarse de industria fundamental (Ley #133, Ley de Protección y Estímulo al Desarrollo Industrial, 20 de Marzo de 1958), y por tanto, gozar de dicha protección y estímulo para su pleno desarrollo inicial.

Como se verá en este informe preliminar, la necesidad de facilidades modernas de varadero y astillería en la Costa Atlántica, es de vital importancia a la sobrevivencia de las flotas de pesca. Dichas flotas sufren


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

graves restricciones operacionales debido a la ausencia de dichos servicios, tan comunes y atentamente brindados a las flotas norteamericanas y mejicanas. Nosotros poseemos los equipos y el personal técnico necesarios, pero más aún poseemos la plena confianza de poder llegar a ofrecer los servicios, facilitando naves más modernas y eficientes en todas las flotas del Caribe.

## 11. ANALISIS DEL MERCADO

La función primaria del astillero será la construcción de embarcaciones de acero y madera, de 30 a 200 toneladas. Esto incluye camaroneros, lanchas-toros, falúas, canguros ligeros y lanchones de pasajeros y de patrulla. La segunda función de la empresa, será el darle servicios de reparación y mantenimiento a toda clase de embarcaciones de esta índole en el área del Caribe, de igual o superior calidad que las ofrecidas en Méjico, Trinidad o los Estados Unidos.

Hasta cierto punto el astillero intentará la especialización de la construcción de un camaronero de 35 toneladas de tal calidad que pueda competir favorablemente en el mercado mundial. Se intentarán construcciones en acero y en madera. La construcción en madera presenta la ventaja que una gran parte, sino toda la madera, puede procurarse en los aserraderos locales de Bluefields. Otra ventaja que posee la construcción en madera es un proyecto de producción en serie, en la cual, las formas de las diferentes piezas de las naves, se construirán en grupos previstos para la prefabricación. Será posible visualizar en un futuro, vender camaroneros, no solamente completamente armados, sino también en piezas prefabricadas listas

para armar por varaderos con pocas facilidades en maquinaria, madera, etc.

Mercado nacional y centroamericano. Son pocos los países en la América que poseen las facilidades de astilleros para la construcción de embarcaciones del calado de un camaronero. Estos países son el Perú, Méjico y los Estados Unidos. La producción del Perú es pequeña y relativamente ineficiente, y su influencia en el Caribe, es nula. Las naves mejicanas están hechas de buen material, pero de pésima mano de obra, unidos a


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

-4-

diseños anticuados y crudas, por lo cual sufren enormes fatigas estructurales en mares crecidas. En los Estados Unidos la producción de camaroneros se reduce al producto de cinco compañías principales, a razón de un promedio de unas cinco naves anuales por astillero. Son embarcaciones excelentes, con los últimos adelantos en equipos de pesca y navegación. Sin embargo, son naves costosas, debido al alto costo de la mano de obra y materias primas del país. Ya que promovemos la mayor parte de la madera en Bluefields, un personal técnico adiestrado y competente, y un diseño funcionalmente superior de embarcación, podremos suplir las necesidades para una flota de pesca nacional, así como *también exportar* dichas embarcaciones al mercado mundial. Nos basamos en cálculos preliminares, de poder producir una excelente nave, de menor costo que las naves norteamericanas, con una calidad que esperamos, sea superior.

El mercado nacional. El mercado inmediato para nuestros camaroneros son las flotas nacionales. La Booth Fisheries tiene mucho interés en proveer seis naves mas de inmediato. Proyecta una posible expansión de veinte naves más en los próximos dos o tres años. También la posibilidad de arrendar a vender a plazos de pago dichas naves a capitanes locales, así como también, estimular las inversiones de otros capitales nacionales. Estimamos un mercado nacional de unas veinticinco naves camaroneras en los próximos tres años. Las demandas del resto del Caribe, podrán estimarse conservadoramente en unas cuarenta naves, haciendo un total de setenta y cinco embarcaciones, que se comprarán en Méjico y los Estados Unidos. Con nuestra producción de quince naves en uno periodo de tres años, es evidente que poseemos un mercado *firmísimo* aquí mismo en el Caribe sin *abatirnos* con "las demandas" del Pacífico y otras áreas de intensa pesca.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

En cuanto al varadero, estimamos que con nuestras modernas insta-
laciones podremos dar servicio a 600 naves anualmente. Compárese con
los servicios del varadero de Scanner Key, que está dando servicios
parciales a 43 naves anualmente.

En proyección, se estima que las flotas camaroneras en Nicaragua
llegarán a 40 naves en este año. Añádanse unas 40 embarcaciones cos-
teras de todas índoles. Esto constituye un total de 120 embarcaciones
que requieren los servicios de un varadero cuatro veces al año (tres
varajes al año normales y uno de emergencia), o sea, un total de 480
varajes anuales. Los varaderos locales, podrán satisfacer unos cien
varajes en conjunto. Esta situación ha forzado a un gran número de
camaroneros tener que irse del país para reparar sus naves (a Honduras,
Méjico, y hasta los Estados Unidos), con la consiguiente pérdida de
tiempo de pesos y de divisas para Nicaragua.

Limitaciones de orden técnico. Serán las siguientes inicialmente:
la ausencia de personal técnico local, y el tiempo de importación de
la gran diversidad de piezas y material mecánico.

El diseño del astillero - varadero se ha hecho contemplando expan-
siones futures al paso que progresan las demandas. Esta planificación
se ha hecho también en torno a los dos talleres (carpintería y mecánica).

El primer factor, la ausencia de personal adiestro en construcción de
navos de acero se superará inicialmente con la utilización del personal
maestro de la Compañía. Asignarle dos o tres asistentes locales,
éstos podrán aprender prácticamente las especialidades requeridas. El
segundo faster, sólo podrá resolverse con una eficiente coordinación


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

con el personal de distribución y suministros a la Compañía en Miami. Será posible tener: cualquier pieza o material en el Bluff en no más de dos semanas después de pedida por las oficinas locales.(vía aérea). Se contempla además tener un gran surtido de piezas de repuestos en nuestros almacenes del astillero.

Competencia externa o interna. En cuanto al astillero, no existe competencia externa ni interna en el orden centroamericana. La única competencia que encontraremos serán la mejicana, y la norteamericana.

El estudio comparativo de esta competencia sigue a continuación:

(a) Precios. Camaronero, (madera, 35 ton., sin metro).

| Pais           | Precio                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Mejico         | US$ 31,000.00              |
| Estados Unidos | US$ 45,000.00              |
| Nicaragua      | US$ 40,000.00 (Proyectado) |

(b) Calidad de materiales..

*   Méjico: Buen material; malos diseños y construcción general.
*   Mami: Buenos materiales; excelentes diseños: construcción varía con la Compañía desde buena hasta excelente.
*   Nicaragua: Buen material: diseños y construcción excelentes.

(c) Canales y política de distribución: Aunque sin duda será dificil al encontrarse inicialmente en ventas con los mercados Mejicanos y Norte-americanos, debido a los altos aranceles de estos países, tenemos un mercado ilimitado en el resto del Caribe. Competimos favorablemente debido a la excelente posición de Nicaragua con respecto a los mercados Centroamericanos, Venezolanos, Colombianos, etc.

En cuanto al varadero, es de notar que comparativamente, los varaderos extranjeros son por mucho, menos costosos que los nacionales,

## IV. JUSTIFICACION SOCIO - ECONOMICA

Empleo. En el primer año de producción, el personal de la empresa será de diez y seis hombres, distribuidos en la forma si-
guiente:

Personal de Administración: cuatro empleados (un administrador y contador público) un asistente de oficina, y dos encargados de ser- vicios y mantenimiento).

Personal de Carpinteria: siete empleados (un jefe de carpintería, tres carpinteros de rivera y marina, dos asistentes de carpintería).

Personal de Mecanica: cinco empleados (un jefe de mecánica y tornería, dos mecánicos especializados, y dos asistentes de mecánica).

Todos los empleados de la empresa, recibirán inicialmente - según basados en sus conocimientos técnicos, años de experiencia, etc.

Dicha escala de pagos será superior a las normales, para atraer a la empresa, el mejor personal posible. Se contempla además un plan de aumentos de sueldos fijos y meritorios, para estímulo de los es- fuerzos de superación de los empleados.

Se espera aumentar el número del personal a veinte para el segundo año de producción, y a veintidós para el tercer año. Efectuar en la Balanza de Pesca. Las flotas camaroneras en Nicaragua Las sus- tente ser efectivas por unas diez a quince embarcaciones anualmente.

Dichas embarcaciones son compradas en su totalidad, en Méjico y los Estados Unidos. Sus valores conjuntos en un periodo, de tres años.

Asciendendo a un mínimo de US$ 900,000.00 a un mínimo de US$ 3,035,000.00.

Nuestra producción durante éste periodo, será de catorce camaroneros con un valor de US$ 600,000.00 que representan divisas que permanecen en el país.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

Beneficios al Consumidor y al Desarrollo Economico. Presente-
mente, la mayoria de los camareros en el area, no tienen facilidades
para servicios de reparacion mecionles, y en la mayoria de los casos,
ni aun facilidades de varaje. Esto es debido en parte, al poco
calado de las vias ferreas de los varaderos locales, asi como tam-
bien, lo anticuado que resultan sus equipos. Debido a estas dificultades,
muchas camaroneras tienen que remontarse a Honduras, Mejico y a veces
hasta los Estados Unidos para efectuar reparaciones de averias normales
o accidentales. Es dificil estimar con certeza las perdidas totales
que incurren dichas embarcaciones, entre los tramites legales de
entradas, y salidas a otros paises, los costos de combustible y par-
ticular, y de mayor importancia, las perdidas enormes que representa el
tiempo perdido de pesca. Puesto que nuestros varaderos poseeran mayor
capacidad que al requerido normalmente, esto representara una garantia
de servicio a aquellas embarcaciones con averias de emergencia. etc. De
este modo, captaremos aquellas embarcaciones que ordinariamente tienen
que abandonar el pais para efectuar sus reparaciones, con las consiguientes
repercusiones de divisas y tiempo valioso de pesca en aguas nicar-
raguenses.

Proteccion y Estimulo: Dada las caracteristicas de industria fun-
damental (Fomento Ley #133, del 30 de Marzo de 1958), un astillero recibira
ayuda gubernamental durante sus primeros años de desarrollo, para solventar
las tan necesarias reinversiones requeridas por una empresa de tal com-
plejidad y magnitud. Presentemente, se estan haciendo en Managua, las
gestiones necesarias para darle a esta empresa el reconocimiento legal
de industria fundamental, con todo auxilio gubernamental.

Boresse a vapor. Se fijan las traviesas y coletines, seguido a lo cual se corta: los excesos del astillaje. Empezando desde la quilla hacia arriba se van acizcando el entablado del casco de modo que cada pieza posea un ajuste perfecto; y para (al echar el casco al agua, la madera sufre una expansión precalculada que sella por completo el casco sin necesidad de calafatear). Se barran el encause del eje y se fijan los soportes del timón y su canula.; se colocan los tanques de combustible, agua potable y la bodega de refrigeración. Se tire el entablado de la cubierta y la caseta de la tripulación. Se colocan los refuerzos de acero a la proa, popa y cuarto de máquinas. Ya en ésta etapa comienzan las instalaciones secundarias como son, la pintura, tendido electrico, plomeria, colocar equipos y mistiles, plumas con su winch, colocar la planta motris y echar la nave al agua. Ya en el agua, se llevan a cabo los trabajos finales.

Para una carencia de acero, el proceso es mucho más sencillo, y por consiguiente de menos etc.

El proceso normal de servicio de varada, a una embarcación es la siguiente: La cuna (ven diagrama No. 1 y No. 3), espera a la embarcación a la entrada de la rampa. Izando las boyas de maniobra, la nave penetra sobre la cuna y queda presa por las traviesas que la tripula- ción sabe desde la nave. El winche No. 1 sube la cuna sobre la carre- lateral y alli la asigna a su sección correspondiente. Ya en la meseta, se raspa inmediatamente con cepillos electricos portátiles y agua a presión. Mientras el casco se orea, se le inspecciona minuciosa- mente para advertir alguna señal de penetración par gusanlos en la madera.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

-16-

Se comienzan los trabajos de calafateo y al asegurar el casco en general. Le sigue, las primeras capas de pintura de protección. Mientras tanto, los trabajos necesarios de mecánica se están efectuando en al interior. Al darle las últimas capas de pintura al fondo, se efectúa la inspección final, y al secar la última capa se echa al agua. La operación completa no dura más de dos o tres días en un dique moderno, y conlleva los trabajos unordinados de dos carpinteros, un mecánico, y dos asistsates de patio, así como también el usual surtido do pienas de reparación y repuesto.

### Instalaciones

Como se puede observar en el diagrama No. 1, el terreno ocupado por el astillero es relativamente pequeño: de unos 15,800 metros cuadrados. Consiste en una rampa de concreto-reforzado, con vía férrea de 4", y posee una extensión de 150 metros de largo por 20 metros de ancho, y en su parte más profunda desciende a una profundidad de siete metros. El patio contral consiste en: un camaral (36 x 17 x 1 m.) que rueda sobre la cénula de concreto (317 x 35 x 1 m.); tree secciones de suma (12 x 30 ma) la torcera terminando en la nave de trabajos de astillaria (22 x 22 x 11 m).

Dos edificios idénticos estan destinados para los talleres de carpintería, mecánica, oficinas y almacenes, con un área de trabajo de 1200 metros cuadrados. Un edificis para la instalación de las dos plantas electricas de 75 kilowatts cada uno, pienas de repuesto y equipos de electricidad en general (un tanque de 350 galones de petroleo estará soterrado al lado del edificio para proveer las plantas de combustible).

(d) Es un centro de abastecimientos de combustible, viveres, piensos y demás articulos.

(e) Pleno reconocimento de los potenciales del área por la REVUTICA. Sin duda, de aún mayor beneficio, hubiese sido un puerto con gran calado de fonduo y accesor. Presentemente, la barra de arena del Bluff, limita la entrada a dicho puerto a embarcaciones con un calado de 13 pies o menos (un máximo de 800 tons.). Esto limita enormemente el tráfico comercial en Bluefields. Posiblemente, en un futuro no muy remoto, se drague dicha barra, y para entonces, nosotros estaremos lo suficientemente desarrollados para dar servicios en diques flotantes a naves de gran tonelaje, haciendo así, del Puerto de Bluefields, un puerto de primera magnitud mercantil.

Posibilidades previstas de Expansiones Futuras:

Se provee, en éste estudio preliminar, la construcción de una nave estacional de 50 x 35 x 7 metros, para servir de taller general a tres ramales de astilleros simultáneamente. Igualmente, la construcción de un muelle de concreto para aquellas tareas que no requieran varaje. El muelle irá equipado con una grúa móvil, y servicios de electricidad y agua potable. Tentativamente, éste plan (Fase II) se llevará a cabo durante el segundo año de operaciones. (Véase el diagrama No. 1).

NOTA DEL APENDICE:

El revestudio de las necesida des del astillero, de las extensas (e intensas) reparaciones que ruquiera las flotas, y del enorme volumen del maizicato, rovais el enorme peso que tendrá que sobrellevar los talleres de Mecánica y carpinteria.

Dado el capital que dispone INVEANICA en estos momentos, solo puede disponor de US$ 25,000.00 para diche talleres (más US$ 6,500 en equipos que ya poseemos) para dichos talleres, ya que en ésta el enfasis está en la construcción y una producción inmediata.

Sin embargo, que una inversión adicional en los talleres, son de vital importancia para una producción eficiente y de menor costo.

El astillero, por naturalesa, demanda en una producción en serie, varios equipos sofisticados, un notable volumen de piezas de repuesto y capital auxiliar.

Podemos optar por comprar dichos equipos con las ganancias del primer año. Pero creo conveniente, quo esta suma adicional se le incorpore al plan de préstamos inicialve, solisitados por la empresa.

23 July 1965

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with George Lodge, Harvard School of Business

1. On 15 July 1965, with Mr. Andy Croce of CA Staff, I met Mr. Lodge at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel to discuss what he knew about the relations among AMBIDDY-1, Bishop McGrath of Panama, and a rural development program they are all working on in Panama. Mr. Lodge described Bishop McGrath as a real ball of fire, about 39 or 40 years old, born of U. S. parents in the Canal Zone but he has taken Panama citizenship. He graduated from Notre Dame University, did graduate work in Rome and has taught in several European and Latin American universities, such as in Chile. He is one of the three top Catholic prelates in Latin America and has extremely close ties with the Vatican, e.g., he is on the Ecumenical Council and on the birth control group. He has an official operating budget of $2,000 per year which he augments from every conceivable source, particularly from the German bishops. He is politically and operationally minded, an American completely in his attitude and behavior, a typical Irish politician, Mr. Lodge submitted somewhat wryly. His parents are retired and live in Miami where he visits often. He recently met AMBIDDY-1 there on two occasions. On this same visit he also met the Papal Nuncio from Santo Domingo (he appears to receive most of the hot potato type assignments in his part of the world).

2. Veraguas Province of Panama is a selected testing ground for community development programs in rural areas. It is the poorest and most hopeless province of Panama, a small armed uprising took place there in 1958 and wee put down. The Communists have their best organization in Panama in this province. The program there is based on the village of San Francisco, about 10 miles off the highway, and is an expansion of the efforts of the parish priest Father VASQUEZ

Pinto who has been thereabout 10 years. He is a dynamic young man who has lead the villagers to rebuild their village and church to develop their land and organize a cooperative and small credit facilities. The village is only 1,200 people but they raised by themselves $1,000 to buy materials and then built a training center capable of housing, feeding and training 60 men at a time in rural cooperatives and rural development. One of their ideas is to select bright looking leaders and potential leaders from rural areas, first in Panama and later, hopefully, from other nearby countries for visits of a few days in which they hope to brain-wash them of Communist type propaganda they may have heard and show them what can actually be done so they can take the good word with them to their own communities. This is in addition to the regular formal course of 4 months for selected young potential leaders from rural communities in Panana and all over Latin America.

3. Another leading light in the program is Father Steele who was thrown out of Dominica by Trujillo for organizing cooperatives and is a recognized authority on the subject. Father Steele uses Veraguas as a home base but travels to Chile, Colombia and other countries conducting short training courses on the ground. There are some Dutch priests on the staff whom Bishop McGrath personally recruited. Father Vasquez Pinto has sent about 10 to 15 local boys. to the Antigonish School in Nova Scotia and they are back for duty. Mr. Lodge describes the group as a highly motivated and energetic group and Father Vasquez Pinto as a young and effective Panamanian priest who is a good operator. Mr. Lodge has two men from Harvard University there to study the program and assist in any way they can. The Peace Corps has 54 people in the Central Provinces of Panama, about 30 of then in Veraguas Province. They cooperate with the center, in fact the two Harvard men are interviewing each of the Peace Corps volunteers about their work. Mr. Lodge said they are coming up with some good information and ideas which other- wise would be lost as there is a good deal of experience among the Peace Corps kids but they don't know to recognize its significance or how to organize it into useable form.

4. The above group is trying to organize the center As a viable base with an effective staff to continue the training program even if the present leaders should move on. They hope it will become a pilot program for Latin America and that they will be able to seed other similar programa from

# SECRET

this one. They hope to be able to spot and develop leaders in remote arcas for future operations in those areas. Incidental to these major objectives, they are also helping to develop the economy of Veraguas, to develop production, transport to markets, credit facilities, and in general to help alleviate grievances which the Communists have exploited in the past.

5. Bishop McGrath has arranged with AMBIDDY-1 for about six of AMBIDDY-l's people to attend the January 1966 training course, with 3 or 4 to remain on the staff. Hopefully, one of them will develop into the executive director of the center. It was agreed that the first man will not be too closely associated in the public eye wita AMBIDDY-1 in order to try to forestall initial bad publicity from opposition elements. AMBIDDY-1 and Bishop McGrath agreed, therefore, that Nestor IZQUIERDO (who is well known as a long-time adherent of AMBIDDY-1 from 1958-59 Comandos Rurales days in Oriente) would not be assigned to the Panama center at this time. AMBIDDY-1 told Bishop McGrath that he would try to obtain sufficient funds to support the men assigned to the center. He has not yet brought up this matter with his case officer, and as the amounts will be very small, he may try to squeeze it out of his newly authorized budget. However, he may ask the Agency for additional holp to sponsor these men while they are working their way into the program. It is intended that the Cubans would continue cooperation in the program, eventually working them into the field wherever they are needed and acceptable.

6. Mr. Lodge will meet Bishop McGrath next in Panama on 29 or 30 July. As a coincidence AMBIDDY-1 will probably be in or near Panama around the same time, as he left 14 July for Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama for meetings with their presidents and several days visit in each country.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/TE/3

ATTENTION: Jonathan Hanke, C/WH/3-Bolivia

SUBJECT: Kleodoro VENTOCILA Canara

1. On 29 July 1965 I discussed Subject with Major Lupton of Detachment "" of ACSI Headquarters. In response to my direct questions Major Lupton stated the following:

a. ACSI is not using subject but they have been considering such use.

b. Subject is not working in Bolivia or anywhere else for ACBI or any other Defense Department component that Major Lupton is avare of.

c. ACBI was unaware that subject had been designating himself as a sort of public relations representative and press man in behalf of General BARRIENTOS.

2. I stated to Major Lupton that we held a poor opinion of subject, regarded his as an opportunist, and a posible candidate for "bura" action. Furthermore we were concerned about his alleged press activities in behalf of BARRIENTOS and felt if he were in anyway connected with a United States Intelligence agency and this became known, it could have an adverse affect on the extremely delicate political situation which now exists in that country and very well place the U.S. Covernment in an embarrassing position with respect to the Bolivian Government. Based on our vious regarding subject I told Eajor Lapton that we would not coordinate any operational proposal ACBI night put forward aimed at using subject's services.

3. Hajer Lepton took the above in good grace and asked if it were presihiv for us to provide him with any information concerning zabject's background and other details which would sive ACTI a clearer picture of his activities. I told Major Lupton that i would look into this and lot hin know whether we

could comply.

4. In light of Major Lupton's request in paragraph 3 above, is there any material of such nature that is suitable for passage to his office?

# DISPATCH

TO Chief, WH

FROM Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT TYPIC, Operational/AMWORLD/ANLILACS
Report on AMBIDDY-1

ACTION REQUIRED - FYI

REFERENCE - None

1. In late July 1965 members of the AMLILAC Group re- ported the following information as a result of their contacts with various members of AMYUM located in the JMWAVE area.

A. AMBIDDY-1 has a warehouse in the WAVE area in which he is storing equipment brought back from his Central American base. The equipment includes UDT gear, boat motors, rafts, uniforms, and bulldozers. There are no weapons in the building.

B. AMBIDDY-1 is planning to put the BABUN PC into proper condition for use as a Mother Vessel. The vessel is now in Tampa. AMBIDDY-1 spent over $10,000, on this ship last year.

C. AMLILAC-8, a former AMLILAC who was fired a couple of years ago and who has been with AMBIDDY-1's group since then, was in the local area recently and told AMLILAC-6 that A-8 was the caretaker at one of the Bases in Central America along with 9 other men. He stated that they had all the weapons from the last effort and were preparing the camp for re-activation. AMBIDDY-1 told A-8 that $500,000, was available for the reactivation.

2. The penchant of PBRUMEN exiles for exaggeration, embellishmonts, and contortion of information (as can be seen from para 1 B, and C) continues to plague the remnants of ANWORLD and as a consequence gives rise to jealous fears on the part of the AMLILAC Group particularly as to the real state of ANWORLD. Such reports as those above and others when

collected by the AMLILACS - tend to affect the latters' morale and confidence in KUBARK because the AMLILACS believe that anything AMBIDDY-1 does is done with KUBARK support and blessing. As Headquarters is avare the great fear of the AMLILACS is that AMBIDDY-1 will get all the action and all the glory. However, in view of the current KUBARK/AMBIDIT-1 relationship the AMLILACs have little to fear and a renewed morale crisis is not expected to arise. On the other hand, if AMBIDDT-1 were to re-activate part of his action force and conduct a raid utilizing non-KUBARK support, that would be another matter. It would then be very difficult to convince the ANLILACs that KUBARX was not involved and their morale and confidence would be badly shaken. This situation is brought to your attention simply to show what effect such AMBIDDY-1 activities would have on this Station's painstaking efforts to retain a superior and experienced commando capability under already difficult psychological conditions.

Possible Arms Purchases from AMWORLD by Bay of Pigs Veterans Association.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES: Action Required: For Your Information.

References: A. UFGA-31947, 11 June 1965.
B. UFGA-22527, 30 July 1965.

1. On 21 July 1965, AMOT-237 furnished the following in AMOT Report BD-1531, which information he had received from ESIRE-1:

a. Juan Jose PERUYERO Rodrigues (201-294249), President of the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association, Alberto MARTINEZ Echenique (201-290790) and Ruben GONZALEZ de la Heria, are making overtures to buy arms from ANBIDDY-1. The Association's Directorate, and the membership-at-large, have not yet been told officially of this contemplated deal.

b. ESIRE-1 felt this information was partially confirmed by the following comment made to him by Luis Humberto VIDANA Guasch (201-274685) in a conversation: "What do you think that ANBIDDY-1 has been reduced to doing? He now wants to sell the arms he has left over from all that business he was mixed up in ... and to think that a person like him is receiving aid."

c. ESIRE-1 thinks it possible that the BABUN brothers may be the persons financing PERUYERO in the purchase of the AMWORLD arms. ESIRE-1 commented that PERUYERO would not dare tell him about buying any AMWORLD arms as he knows that ESIRE-1 would be opposed to such negotiations on the grounds that this would be immoral.

2. Previous reporting on AMWORLD/AMBIDDY-1 activities has indicated, as in Reference A, that ANBIDDY-1 was interested in buying for arms and ammunition.

3. ESIRE-1's commert, about a possibility that the FABUN brothers may be the mersons interested in purchasing the AETORLD arms, ties in with the ANCRAG-1 information reported in Reference B that Teofilo BABUN, Luis Fumberto VIDANA Guasch, and EMBARB-1 were acting as go-betweens for General INBERT's junta in the Dominican Republic and the recruiting of Cuban exiles in Kiani.

4. On 30 July 1965 AMOT-14 reported in DD-1532 that AMLINT-1 had been in a Jocal restaurant where he overheard a conversation between Alfredo BORGES Caignet (201-347593), now Immigration Secretary for AMWORLD, and Jose Luis SOSA Sancio (201-746587). BORGES told SOSA: "Be ready to go back to the place where you were lefore, because you will have to leave for there in the first four or five days of August. AMWORLD will function in the same manner as previously, but with more independence." BORGES also commented to SOSA that AMBIDDY-1 is the current cwner of the Vizcaya Restaurant at 142 S.W. 37th Avenue."

A. HR76-4371, 25 June 1965 (not sent HR7658)
B. HR76-4429, 3 June 1965 (not sent Lima and La Paz)

1. The long-delayed meeting with QUIXOTE took place on 29 July 1965 to discuss various CRIREX has a serious operational interest in clandestine VENEISCILLA Camara. Headquarters was informed that CRIREX is not using Subject operationally but that they had been considering as. CRIREX was 805 spoke that Subject has been representing himself as a public relations representative for General Rene BARRIENTOS, Co-President of the Bolivian Junta. CRIREX was informed that CRIREX had a poor opinion of CRIREX regarding him as an opportunist whose actions sacrifice, ostensibly on behalf of the Bolivian Junta and specifically PAREDEMOS, combined with may covert relationship with CUI CJUS escala, if discovered and exploited by Leftists in Bolivia, have an adverse effect on the extremely delicate political situation in Bolivia. As a result, Headquarters was informed that HUMAK would not at this time be in favor of coordinating any operational use of Subject which CRIREX might propose.

2. For Lima: CRIREX said that its initial notification to HUMAK concerning Subject being run by an CRIREX detachment at Lima was in error.

3. For HR7658: CRIREX evidently has some sort of contact with Subject in the JODWYN area where his file had to be segregated from their control arrangements before the 19 July meeting could be held. Also, information in reference B obtained from Subject was more precisely attuned by him for transmitted to CRIREX. (The information about the clandestine situation in Bolivia is completely erroneous.)

SUBJECT: Operational/TYPIC/AMOT/ANWORLD Charges Against KUBARK in the Death of Roberto TRUJILLO Rodrigues.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES: Action Required: For Your Information.

1. On 11 August 1965, ANTAUP-2, accompanied by Dr. Luis CASAS Martinez, former provincial commissioner of Camaguey, held a conversation with ANTAUP-1 in which he learned the information given below. This information was reported in AMOT Report DD-1563, 13 August 1965.

2. According to ANTAUP-1, Alicia TUDELA Sanches is planning to bring up again the case of the the death of her husband, Roberto TRUJILLO Rodrigues, who died in the AMWORLD training camps which were under the direction of AMBIDDY-1. According to ANTAUP-1, TUDELA plans to blame KUBARK for the death of her husband. TUDELA claims details of her husband's death which she has in her possession will substantiate this accusation.

3. ANTAUP-1 also says that TUDELA is preparing to make an attempt on the life of AMBIDDY-1. She is receiving information from persons close to AMBIDDY-1 on all AMBIDDY-1's movements and is looking for a silencer to put on the gun she will use in this attack. ANTAUP-1 resorts that he has attempted to calm TUDELA down and is trying to persuade her to give up the idea of attacking AMBIDDY-1.

4. ANTAUP-2 commented that ANTAUP-1 boasts that he is the one who obtained the information and proof against AMWORLD and KUBARK in the death of TRUJILLO and that he has this proof in his possession. ANTAUP-3 believes that it was ANTAUP-1 who steered TUDELA's accusations from AMWORLD towards KUBARK.

Report on AMBIDDY-1

ACTION: At WAVE's discretion, pass para 5 to ANLILACS.

REF: UPGA 22667, 10 August 1965

1. As you know, the HQS AMWORLD case officer recently visited the WAVE area and went to the warehouse with ANJAVA-4 and his wife, described as a possible purchaser of some of the equipment. The warehouse is full of moldy and rusting camp and support equipment, most of it of no use in mounting raiding operations. There are outboard motors, small generators, engine spare parts, air drop equipment, bedding, etc. in addition to a large pen of baby chicks purchased by AMBIDDY-1 in his latest venture of training for rural civic development programs in Central America. There was one custodian working around the warehouse and taking care of the chickens. AMBIDDY-1 has also purchased an off-set printing press, for $10,000 according to his, which is set up a few blocks away. He plans to use it to print the ANYUM magazine, plus hopefully making some profit for AMYUM from it on commercial printing jobs.

2. AMJAVA-4 and AMBIDDY-1 both laughed heartily at the idea that the PC of BABUN could be converted to a mothership. This was considered and rejected several months ago when AMWORLD was still authorized to operate. They turned down the offer of the ship as a gift then on grounds that it would be uneconomical even if given to them free of charge..

3. AMBIDDY-1 said he did have a total of ten men in Nicaragua; five at Monkey Point guarding a cache of small arms and teaching the local Indians to read, write and grow rice; three men at Bluefields guarding a cache of small arms and working to develop a small boat yard for repair and maintenance of shrimp boats from which AMBIDDY-1 hopes to build a fishing cooperative; and two men at Managua with a smaller cache of small arms, one of whom is the AMYUM delegate to the Nicaraguan Government. AMBIDDY-1 kept about 150 small arms, with the knowledge and consent of HQS, in return for his giving back: or accounting for the heavier and crew-served weapons and most of the small arms from AMWORLD. He claims that all three caches in Nicaragua are in concrete underground locations which are rigged

for immediate destruction by the custodiars should an attempt be made to seize them. AMBILLT-1 said hehad seither plans nor money to reactivate any bases, except as they might be used for local civic action type programs.

4. AMBIDDY-1 vas advised by his case officer in strongest terms to sell or throw away ever, thing from the Central American canps, to concentrate on trying to project a new image of hinself as a constructive and progressive leader involved in community development and civic action type programs in Latin America by invitation of the local governments, and to stop talking or acting as a paramilitary operator. He vas advised in eves stronger terms to get out of the DAVE area as soon as possible to remove himself as a target of constant personal attacks against which he could not defend himself. He agreed in principle, subject to waiting three months for his wife to deliver their first child.

5. WAVE may assure the ANLILAC leader that, to the best knowledge of KUBARK, the AMWORLD program is dead, that AMBIDDY-1 has no real intention and only limited capability of mounting raids, and that anything he might do along the lines of paramilitary action would certainly be without ODYOKK support or blessing given the present political climate in 808 area.

6. FYI, HQ8 continues to try to influence AMBIDDY-1 to stay out of paramilitary matters entirely. To this end, we shall try to keep his top operational personnel otherwise occupied in KUBARK or other employment, to keep him as fully and usefully occupied as possible away from the WAVZ and PBRUMEN area, and to convince hin to sell or lease his two Swift boats to commercial enterprises or to another KUBARK program outside the WAVE area.

7. Që will welcome continued reporting on AMBIDDY-1°'s activities from WAVE sources, which serves a useful purpose as a check and monitor for the case officer to compare and contrast with AMBIDDY-1's reports to him. In addition, we are recruiting the former AMWORLD Deputy for Support and Administration, who also serves as legal and political advisor to AMBIDDY-1. He is now residing in the HQS area, is back on the staff of a large university and has agreed to assist in keeping AMBIDDY-1 on the straight and narrow path following the lines of paragraphs 4 and 6 above.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM : AMBIDDY/1 - 23 August 1965

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 discussions with General Anastasio SOMOZA, President SCHICK and other Nicaraguan officials, 24 Jul-20 Aug 1965.

1. A/1 first met with General SOMOZA 27/28 July. The following points were made in these discussions:

a. General SOMOZA said the State Department is making an investigation of how much money he is using to control the government and win the next presidential elections. SOMOZA told A/l that he intended to run and fully expected to win the election, but would not need to buy any votes. He asked A/1 to please tell "Washington" that State is very clumsy and if they really want to know anything they should call on the Agency, or the FBI, either of which is much more effective. SOMOZA said everybody in Managua knows about State's efforts to block his candidacy and are laughing at them.

b. SOMOZA said he was meeting Daniel ODUBER of Costa Rica at the border shortly, and they would make a "non- aggression pact" agreeing that neither will make trouble for the other's campaign for election to Presidency. ODUBER had asked for the interview. SOMOZA told A/l that he thought ODUBER had made a "live and let live" agreement with the Com- munists, and that at their meeting, he would demand from ODUBER a public denunciation of the Communists to be followed by effective control measures.against them.

c. The MRR will be allowed to build and operate a mall boatyard for construction, maintenance and repair of shrimp boats at Bluefields without SOMOZA or the Nicaraguan Government to be cut into the proceeds. This is part of A/l's community development progrem, simed at developing a large fishing cooperative based on Bluefields which will be self- sustaining and profitable for the members and the local economy. SOMOZA also approved continuation of the basic education program being conducted by All's five man contingent at the old Monkey Point base and eventual development of that area as a rice- growing cooperative for the benefit of the local Indians.

d. General SOMOZA, at A/l's strong recommendation, agreed to start pushing Civic Action programs through the National Guard in an effort to enhance his personal image preparatory to the next Presidential campaign. SOMOZA asked A/1 to assist and advise in this effort.

2. The next meeting with General SOMOZA by A/1 was on 4 August, with following points:

a. SOMOZA said that the latest program of Fidel CASTRO is targetted against Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. Pars of the plan includes assassination of the presidents of the three countries as part of a terror campaign to soften them up. He said that in Panama, particularly, President Marcos ROBLES is a prime target but the Communists are exploiting a recent turn against him by the National Guard because he has cut down on their costs, pensions, and other privileges. If ROBLES is eliminated from power, the Communists feel the chief of the National Guard will take over and they thinking they can handle him more easily than they can ROBLES.

b. Source for above, according to SOMOZA, was a close associate of Marcial AGUILUZ, whom he described as the top Communist in Costa Rica and one who had recruited (fnu) FONSECA, a Nicaraguan now living in Mexico. FONSECA is a bastard son of one of SOMOZA's foremen, a Communist, ard an agent working directly under order of Fidel CASTRO.

c. A/1 and SOMOZA talked again about a Civic Action program in Nicaragua and SOMOZA said again that he would support it. He will assign Father LUGO, a Cuban priest who served with the Bay of Pigs forces, to a position similar to a chaplain in the National Guard in order to assist in the program. SOMOZA will support MRR community development programs with whatever authorizations are required and with whatever official or personal prestige he may offer.

3. A/1 next returned to Managua on 17 August and met with Major PEREZ of the Nicaraguan Customs Service, a personal aide to the Ceneral. PEREZ said SOMOZA was very angry (not at A/1 or his people) and difficult to see. He said 3 Colonels were under Arrest for 3 days each for disobeying orders. PEREZ was afraid to nee SOMOZA for fear he might be arrested also. However, A/1 called SOMOZA by phone and was invited to visit him next day at Tipitapa. A/1 met him the next day (18 Aug) and had lunch with SOMOZA and (fnu) BENITEZ, a Puerto Rican, former politician there who is now in business but remains in contact with and working for the U. S. Covernment. After lunch, BENITEZ left

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 171

and A/1 went with SOMOZA in his car. While they were riding, SOMOZA told A/1 why he was so angry.

d. A message had recently come to General SOMOZA from the Nicaraguan Ambassador in Panama saying that he had it from authoritative sources that the U. S. not only would not support his candidacy for the Presidency, but would strongly oppose it. In addition, SOMOZA had word that Sydney ROSS, Director of El Tiempo (Spanish language newspaper in New York), after a recent interview with Asst. Secretary Jack Vaughn of the State Department, had an off-the-record talk with VAUGHN after the interview. VAUGHN had said that, so far as he was concerned, SOMOZA was no different from the other Latin American dictators such as TRUJILLO, PERON, DUVALIER, STROESSNER, Col. LOPEZ, or Gen. CASTELL Branco, and that he could certainly not support installing another military dictator in Nicaragua. The two reports were confirmatory in SOMOZA'S mind and made him feel extremely bad as he said he has always talked favorably about the U.S. and tried to cooperate with them at every chance.

e. SOMOZA checked with the U.S. Ambassador in Nicaragua (whether in person or by sending Pres. SCHICK was not made clear) about the matter, and received a typical State Department reply that the U.S. was neutral in Nicaraguan internal affairs and would take no action about the elections. The Ambassador said he could not believe VAUGHN could have made such statements because of the U.S. position of neutrality in Nicaraguan affairs.

f. SOMOZA also said he had sent a message to Washington suggesting that if some of the other countries heard about themselves being lumped with TRUJILLO, PERON, etc. they might well call back their troops from Santo Domingo and tell Washington to go to hell.

g. He said he was going aherd with his plans regardless of what the U.S. does about it and reminded A/l of Mr. J. C. KING's talk with him (SOMOZA) at the airport in Washington to let him know after the miation attack on the SIERRA ARANZAZU that Washington would understand if SOMOZA decided to kick A/l and his camps out of Nicaragua. He used this as an example of an attempt from Washington to dictate to him which he had ignored, telling A/1 that he was a friend, would continue to be, and would continue to make his own decisions regardless of what Washington might want from him. A/1 made another strong suggestion that SOMOZA take off his uniform and start making public his civic action ideas. In addition, he again advised him to go perschally to Washington


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 172

to talk directly with VAUGHN and other U. S. officials to get the picture cleared up. A/1 said, "Let's try to get along with the Norteamericans, it's better to have them with us than against us." SOMOZA agreed, but said he had sent his brother, Luis SOMOZA, ahead.

h. The following day, 19 Aug, General SOMOZA called A/1 and said Luis had called him, reporting he had talked to Vaughn in Miami. Said Vaughn had denied talking to Sydney ROSS or of passing such information to the Ambassador in Panama. Luis said he dropped the subject at that point and talked about other things. (A/l believes Luis could be fabricating as usual or could have botched up the interview if it did take place.) A/l again strongly recommended that General SOMOZA make his own visit to Washington and talk to Vaughn and others in person.

4. On 19 August, A/1 interviewed President SCHICK for the Tridente (MRR news magazine). He had previously interviewed General SOMOZA. The interview reports will be relatively innocuous coverage of some of the major events of the day. The agenda of points for each interview is attached. A/1 intends to dedicate an issue of Tridente to each country which has helped the MRR, e.g. Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM : AMBIDDY/1

SUBJECT: Vidal ESPINAL Herrero, possible CI suspect

1. Subject is a Spaniard who is believed to be working now at the Ron Carta Vieja factory in Panama City. He previously lived in Maragua and worked for Colonel Miguel RUIZ Herrera (a Costa Rican sometimes employed by General Anastasio SOMOKA) as a specialist in guerrilla warfare.

2. About late May or early June, ESPINAL wας drinking in a Managua bar and angaged one of A/l's delegation in conversation, not knowing who be was. He claimed to have been in Guatemala recently where he had worked with some "good people of the lower cleases" in an attempt to overthrow the Guatemalan government. He quoted at Isngth, and accurately, from Che GUEVARA and used examples, also accurately, for some Fidel CASTRO operations on how to overthrow a government. A/1's man played the part of a leftist sympathizer to elicit from subject. Through the Nicaraguan security service, the MRR people found out that Col. RUIZ H. claimed schjact bad some to him and presented himself as a GW expert saying he was willing to vork for him in an attempt to make a coup against the government in Costa Rica. In early July, subject told Col. RUIZ H. that the Costa Rican operation was taking too long and nothing auch vas going on, so he was going to Panana from where he could be called baca immediately when they were ready to go in Costa Rica. Subject had also been overheard to say in Managin that he had a special aission to assassinate a Contral American president.

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 meeting with son of Colonel PERALTA of Guatemala

1. On 24 July 1965, A/1 met with the son of Col. PERALTA, at his request, at the Lido Palace Hotel in Nicaragua. The meeting was arranged by General MONTIEL, chief of the Nicaraguan security service.

2. Young PERALTA said that his father had no faith in the Agency, and neither did he. They still think the Agency put Luis SIERRA to work with Roberto ALEJOS to overthrow Col. PERALTA. They are not satisfied with their liaison with the Agency or with the Embassy, and not at all clear on what U.S. policy or wishes are in connection with Guatemala. Col. PERALTA is willing to do whatever he is able to do, within reason, to meet U.S. expectations, if he only knows what they are, but he is tired of hearing how bad things are without concrete and constructive suggestions about how to improve them.

3. A/1 tried to reassure him, telling him that he (A/1) knew the Agency people in Guatemala very well (not true, of course) and could guarantee it was not true that they had supported ALEJOS or any other coup attempt. A/1 also asked Gen. MONTIEL to try to soothe young PERALTA.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM : AMBIDDY/1

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 discussion with President ORLICH, Foreign Minister ODUBER and other Costa Rican officials, late July to mid-August 1965.

1.  In late July, A/1 went to Costa Rica and met with President ORLICH, telling him the MRR was out of business so far as operations directly against Cuba are concerned, and no longer needs bases, none, or other support for such paramilitary activities. A/1 described the latest MRR program to combat CASTRO/Communist efforts in Latin America by engaging in community development and counter-insurgency activities. He asked only for help in projecting a progressive and constructive image and some basic prestige for the MRR and for himself. To that end, he reminded President ORLICH that both of them knew full well that in the whiskey smuggling scandals and coup attempts for which A/1 had taken the rap, not only was he not guilty, but had been, in fact, the first one to give the warning in both cases. In return for those past favors, he now wants Pres. ORLICH to put him together with Daniel ODUBER (the PLN candidate for president who will almost certainly be elected) in order to counteract the bad-mouth put on A/1 to ODUBER by Manolo RAY, Colonel FIGULS, and Teodore "Yo-yo" QUIROZ. A/1 proposed to meet ODUBER personally, and let him make up his own mind. Pres. ORLICH called ODUBER's office, but he was off politicking on the coast. ORLICH then sent A/1 with Colonel LIPPA (a good friend of A/1) to talk with ODUBER's secretary, who also is a good friend of Col. LIPPA. The secretary (actually a male assistant) said everybody talks about A/1 but nobody really knows him or very much about him. Some good liberal revolutiona- ries say he is a good man, others say he is a S. O. B. A/1 replied that was the reason he had taken the trouble to come to see ODUBER, that he would make his position clear himself and would be glad to confront any accusers if ODUBER so desired. The secretary said they were concerned about the campaign because the opposition was uniting and was getting plenty of money from big businessmen. A/1 offered to help by printing posters, leaflets, and other campaign material if they needed it, free of charge at his "Quality Off-Set Printing Shop" in

Miani. He also offered to help Pres. ORLICH's secretary,
Roberto NADRIZ, who may run for Deputy if he can be
convinced to ignore his shyness and reluctance to make
political speches.

2. On 8 and 9 August, A/1 was again in Costa Rica
   and met with ODUBER, this meeting was arranged by Roberto
   MADRIX. ODURER adaitted that he knew the Cubans vere not
   guilty of the smuggling charges that had been levied against
   then. He also appreciated A/l's previous refusais to assist
   coup plotters and his help in squelching their efforts. A/1
   said he told ODUBER, "I Know you have been told I am a 8. О. В.
   and I want you to see for yourself what I am and make up your
   mind. I know the people who have so described me and would
   like to meet you together with them so you can mace your own
   godgement." A/1 said these opening remarks brought on
   ODUBER's replies about the smuggling and coup reports.

A/1 said he gave CDUBER & quick history of the
:
MRR, what it has done, and what it stands for. He told
ODURER he realized they had not been close before, but he
felt ODUBER and the FLN were the best choice for Costa Rica
and therefore the MRR was prepared to support him in any way
they can, including training, mon and equipment. CDUBEX
asked for a specialist to do some training of his personal
security group, and to furnish some walkie-talkie radios for
then if possible. A/1. assigned Luis ARRIEURIETA Sardinas
(201-298890), a member of the MRR delegation to Costa Rica,
who is well-known and trusted by ODUBER, to full-time duty as
a security adviser and trainer. A/1 also offered to donate
ene issue of Tridente, the MRR news nagasine, to Costa Rica
with favorable emphasis on ODUBER, and send free copies to
Costa Rica. ODUBER also took A/1 up on his previous offer to
print posters, etc. A/l told him that the MRR people had heard
of a Communist plot to trap ODUBER by waiting to the strategic
moment and making a widely publicised declaration that they
are supporting him completely. This would split the PLN and might
lose the slection for ODUBER, thus putting in a weak or reactio-
nary group what the Communists could control or overthøca.
ODUBER said he would expose this scheme and get the jump on then
by saying he doesn't want or need anything from the Communists.
4/1 effered to help him with this through Tridente..

COURER said he would be aldifferent president

U. S., dealing directly with other countries on Costa Rican interests instead of falling in line always with the U.S. and the OAS. A/1 mentioned Pres. ORLICH's offer to recognize a Government of Free Cuba if A/I could manage to seize and hold a piece of Cuba and declare such a government. ODUBER agreed to honor the agreement, without committing troops, but through his good offices in foreign affairs. He agreed to exert moral pressure on the U.S. in behalf of such an under- taking, if necessary, by exploiting the favorable press and public attitude toward him in the U.8.

3. In A/l's opinion, ODUBER is not a Communist by any stretch of the imagination, nor will he be a later edition of "Pepe" FIGURRES. If he does take over, there will be many problems for the U.S. in contrast to the easy-going relationship with "Chico" ORLICH. ODUBER's personal circle includes a strong group of violently antt-0.8. people. Cie of then, according to A/l's delegation in San Jose, is (inu) SUNIGA, a government official who is the Costa Rican in charge of Alliance for Progress matters. He has been beard to say that if ODUBER VARS president, no Costa Rican troops vould be sent to Santo Domingo nor would Costa Rica support GAS decisions forced by the U.8.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM : AMBIDDY/1

SUBJECT: Vidal ESPINAL Herrero, possible CI suspect

1. Subject is a Spaniard who is believed to be working now at the Ron Carta Vieja factory in Panama City. He previously lived in Managua and worked for Colonel Miguel RUIZ Herrera (a Costa Rican sometimes employed by General Anastasio SOMOZA) as a specialist in guerrilla warfare.

2. About late May or early June, ESPINAL was drinking in a Managua bar and angaged one of A/l's delegation in conversation, not knowing who he was. He claimed to have been in Guatemala recently where he had worked with some "goou people of the lower classes" in an attempt to overthrow the Guatemalan government. He quoted at length, and accurately, from Che GUEVARA and used examples, also accurately, for some Fidel CASTRO operations on how to overthrow a government. A/l's man played the part of a leftist sympathizer to elicit from subject. Through the Nicaraguan security service, the MRR people found out that Col. RUIZ H. claimed subject had come to him and presented himself as a GW expert saying he was willing to work for him in an attempt to make a coup against the government in Costa Rica. In early July, subject told Col. RUIZ H. that the Costa Rican operation was taking too long and nothing much was going on, so he was going to Panama from where he could be called back immediately when they were ready to go in Costa Rica. Subject had also been overheard to say in Managua that he had a special mission to assassinate a Central American president.

3. A/1 said the Nicaraguan service believes that Angelini's Restaurant in Panama City is a source of false passports for Communists. A/1 looked at the place on his visit in Panama and found it to be in a poor section inhabited by Communists not far from the International Hotel.

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 meeting with son of Colonel PERALTA of Guatemala

1. On 24 July 1965, A/1 met with the son of Col. PERALTA, at his request, at the Lido Palace Hotel in Nicaragua. The meeting was arranged by General MONTIEL, chief of the Nicaraguan security service.

2. Young PERALTA said that his father had no faith in the Agency, and neither did he. They still think the Agency put Luis SIERRA to work with Roberto ALEJOS to overthrow Col. PERALTA. They are not satisfied with their liaison with the Agency or with the Embassy, and not at all clear on what U.S. policy or wishes are in connection with Guatemala. Col. PERALTA is willing to do whatever he is able to do, within reason, to meet U.S. expectations, if he only knows what they are, but he is tired of hearing how bad things are without concrete and constructive suggestions about how to improve them.

3. A/1 tried to reassure him, telling him that he (A/1) knew the Agency people in Guatemala very well (not true, of course) and could guarantee it was not true that they had supported ALEJOS or any other coup attempt. A/l also asked Gen. MONTIEL to try to soothe young PERALTA.

4. A/1 said young PERALTA was in Managua to attend a meeting concerning tourism in Central America.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM : AMBIDDY/1

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 discussion with President ORLICH, Foreign Minister ODUBER and other Costa Rican officials, late July to mid-August 1965.

1. In late July, A/l went to Costa Rica and met with President ORLICH, telling him the MRR was out of business so far as operations directly against Cuba are concerned, and no longer needs bases, money, or other support for such paramilitary activities. A/l described the latest MRR program to combat CASTRO/Communist efforts in Latin America by engaging in community development and counter-insurgency activities. He asked only for help in projecting a progressive and constructive image and some basic prestige for the MRR and for himself. To that end, he reminded President ORLICH that both of them knew full well that in the whiskey smuggling scandals and coup attempts for which A/l had taken the rap, not only was he not guilty, but had been, in fact, the first one to give the warning in both cases. In return for those past favors, he now wants Pres. ORLICH to put him together with Daniel ODUBER (the PLN candidate for president who will almost certainly be elected) in order to counteract the bad-mouth put on A/1 to ODUBER by Manolo RAY, Colonel FIGULS, and. Teodore "Yo-yo" QUIROZ. A/1 proposed to meet ODÜBER personally, and let him make up his own mind. Pres. ORLICH called ODUBER's office, but he was off politicking on the coast. ORLICH then sent A/1 with Colonel LIPPA (a good friend of A/1) to talk with ODUBER's secretary, who also is a good friend of Col. LIPPA. The secretary (actually a male assistant) said everybody talks about A/l but nobody really knows him or very much about him. Some good liberal revolutiona- ries say he is a good man, others say he is a S. O. B. A/1 replied that was the reason he had taken the trouble to come to see ODUBER, that he would make his position clear himself and would be glad to confront any accusers if COUBER so desired. The secretary said they were concerned about the campaign because the oppostion was uniting and was getting plenty of money from big businessmen. A/l offered to help by printing posters, leaflets, and other campaign material if they needed it, free of charge at his "Quality Off-Set Printing Shop" in

Miami. He also offered to help Pres. ORLICH's secretary, Roberto MADRIZ, who may run for Deputy if he can be convinced to ignore his shyness and reluctance to make political speeches.

2. On 8 and 9 August, A/1 was again in Costa Rica and met with ODUBER, this meeting was arranged by coberto... MADRIZ. ODUBER admitted that he knew the Cubans were not guilty of the smuggling charges that had been levied against them. He also appreciated A/l's previous refusals to assist coup plotters and his help in squelching their efforts. A/1 said he told ODUBER, "I know you have been told I am a S. O. В. and I want you to see for yourself what I am and make up your mind. I know the people who have so described me and would like to meet you together with them so you can make your own Judgement." A/l said these opening remarks brought on ODUBER's replies about the smuggling and coup reports.

A/l said he gave ODUBER a quick history of the MRR, what it has done, and what it stands for. He told COUBER he realized they had not been close before, but he felt ODUBER and the PLN were the best choice for Costa Rica and therefore the MRR was prepared to support him in any way they can, including training, men and equipment. ODUBER asked for a specialist to do some training of his personal security group, and to furnish some walkie-talkie radios for then if possible. A/l assigned Luis ARRIZURIETA Sardinas (201-398890), a member of the MRR delegation to Costa Rica, who is well-known and trusted by ODUBER, to full-time duty as a security adviser and trainer. A/1 also offered to donate one issue of Tridente, the MRR news magazine, to Costa Rica with favorable emphasis on ODUBER, and send free copies to Costa Rica. ODUBER also took A/1 up on his previous offer to print posters, etc. A/1 told him that the MRR people had heard of a Communist plot to trap ODUBER by waiting to the strategic moment and making a widely publicised declaration that they are supporting him completely. This would split the PLN and might lose the election for OnUBER, thus putting in a weak or reactio- nary group whom the Communists could control or overthrow. ODUBER said he would expose this scheme and get the jump on them by saying he doesn't want or need anything from the Communists. A/1 offered to help him with this through Tridante.

ODUBER said he would be a different president that was "Chico" ORLICH and will be more independent of the

U. S., dealing directly with other countries on Costa Rican interests instead of falling in line always with the U.S. and the OAS. A/1 mentioned Pres. ORLICH's offer to recognize a Government of Free Cuba if A/l could manage to seize and hold a piece of Cuba and declare such a government. ODUBER agreed to honor the agreement, without committing troops, but through his good offices in foreign affairs. He agreed to exert moral pressure on the U.S. in behalf of such an undertaking, if necessary, by exploiting the favorable press and public attitude toward him in the U.S.

3. In A/1's opinion, ODUBER is not a Communist by any stretch of the imagination, nor will he be a later edition of "Pepe" FIGUERES. If he does take over, there will be many problems for the U.S. in contrast to the easy-going relationship with "Chico" ORLICH. ODUBER's personal circle includes a strong group of violently anti-U.S. people. One of then, according to A/l's delegation in San Jose, is (fnu) ZUNIGA, a government official who is the Costa Rican in charge of Alliance for Progress matters. He has been heard to say that if ODUBER were president, no Costa Rican troops would be sent to Santo Domingo nor would Costa Rica support OAS decisions forced by the U.S.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation between AMBIDDY-1 and Martin Ferrer

DATE : 30 June 1964 at 2130

1. I was called at home by the security officer and informed that AMBIDDY-1 wished to speak to me. When I returned A-l's call he mentioned that he would be leaving for Costa Rica on 1 July. AMJAVA-4 would be remaining in Miami for four or five days to get the new reorganization under way. A-l asked if we could intercede with INS in facilitating the departure of four or five of his men who wish to leave for the camps. A-1 was informed that we would be unable to take any action until the names have been submitted to us.

2. A-l asked that we assist in obtaining a visa for Inocencio ALONSO Ramirez who will be sent to Mexico. Alonso will replace Pineda in the job that he was originally going to do. A-1 would prefer that Alonso have no contacts with any other Cuban exile organization while in Mexico.

3. A-1 stated that some of the MRR secretariats would need at least one or two weeks to wind up their affairs in Miami. A-l was advised that we realize the dismantling of MRR in Miami could not be done over night. However, any procrastination would be viewed as an act of bad faith.

4. I informed A-l that the ADELAIDA is being insured for $14,000 per annum. A letter of confirmation from the Consejo would be sent shortly.

6 July 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

VIA: Deputy Chief, WH (Special Affairs)

SUBJECT: ANWORLD-AMBIDDY-1, Personality and Handling Problems

1. Has AMBIDDY-1, who is the linchpin of ANWORLD, acquitted himself well so far and by and large lived up to our expectations? The answer to this question is a qualified "yes."

2. Not having been selected by CIA as the man most likely to rally the best elements of the Cuban exile community round his cause, AMBIDDY-1's disappointing showing as a political figure should come as no shock to anyone.

3. AMBIDDY-1 never claimed that remnants of his movement inside Cuba were active or could be directed from abroad.

4. AMBIDDY-1's ability to enlist and organize some good activists has been successfully put to the test. Given the extent of American help (and our methodical harassment of competing action groups), to have accomplished less would have been difficult to excuse.

5. AMBIEDT-1's personality was formed in the orectale of student conspiracy against Batista, American exile, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, two years imprisonment under sentence of death aad, since July 1963, beadship of an unconventional warfare mechani supported by the United States. He is a man of many engaging traits: Sincerity of demeanor, seeming ability to place events in a broader context of history, ready vit and self-depreciation, msatay based on shrewd evaluation of his interlocutors, to mention a few. Subjected

![seal]SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 195

-2-

to stress or suffering misfortune, some of the obverse traits
begin to shov: Uncontrollable outbursts of fury, impulsive
reactions, peevish vindictiveness and self-pity (none of
which have been observed by us firsthand).

6. Imbued with a sonewhat shallow philosophy, AMBIDDY-1..
   is prone to tailor ideas to what he strives to accomplish at
   any given moment and to the impression be desires to leave with
   his opposites. Since he rightly views his relationship with
   the Americans as crucial toward the achievement of main goal,
   vis., to overthrow and succeed Castro, his pronounciamentos
   usually hew close to what he conceives to represent the main
   lines of American thought.

7. AMBIDDY-l's personality feeds on adulation and sur-
   face manifestations of loyalty, despite the fact that he
   claims to view loyalty to his person as ephemeral and as
   under continuing threat of subversion, especially by his
   Ameri1ة تمتlies. To the extent possible, we have attempted
   to assuage his preoccupations on that score.

8. In the final analysis, AMBIDDY-1 trusts only himself
   and views oven his closest associates as nere pavas whose
   relative value fluctuates as the chess game progress.

9. Indoved with an inquisitive and retentive aind,
   ANBIDDY-1 has a remarkable knowledge of facts which in any
   discussion he ably marshals and articulates.

10. ANBIDEY-1's views of things American is conditioned
    by his quest for a key position in the struggle to overthrow
    Castro. Hence, any advice is selectively accepted or (usually
    tacitly) rejected, depending on whether it serves to strengthen
    that position. There is, of course, nothing reprehensible
    about this.

11. AMBIDDY-1 relates to his savironment in essentially
    conspiratorial terms. His world is peopled with demons ar
    saints, the latter frequently apitomized by CIA, the former
    by the Department of State, all ansican moves toward his-
    self and his organization are interpreted by him in those
    terms.

12. AMBIDDY-1 probably fancies himself as an adopt
    student of human behavior. Applying as a gauge his choion
    of intimaten and bedmates, he appears to be capable of
    committing appalling blunders in his judgements of human
    nature.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 196

13. AMBIDDY-1 has permitted himself to get snared in a web finely spun by a squad of hardened veterans of Havana's halfworld. This can be analyzed as manifestation of rank immaturity. More difficult to explain is that AMBIDDY-1 has relinquished control over this affair to an extent where it now threatens his life's work. In AMBIDDY-1's PEQ II we predicted, more boldly than wisely, that he would not get caught up in female entanglements. While we did not underrate the power of sex, we probably overrated AMBIDDY-1's character and motivation.

14. In a project which may have vast consequence as regards the security of the United States (transcending by far its intrinsic value as an unconventional warfare instrument) we, of course, have to take into consideration the possibility that AMBIDDY-1 could be working for the other side-either now or later. We view this possibility as most unlikely, yet feel somewhat remiss in not having paid much attention to what transpired between the landing at Playa Giron and the Rose Bowl ceremony. There has been some talk about his having undergone marked personality changes during that period in his life, but we actually do not know whether and, if so, to what extent his psyche suffered damage.

15. AMBIDDY-1's aged parents live in Cuba. He professes intense filial devotion toward his mother. Thus, Castro has in his power two valuable hostages. We have had some frank talks with AMBIDDY-1 about this subject and he knows that we are not unmindful of the purpose to which such hostages can be put. We have received no indications that pressures have as yet been brought to bear upon AMBIDDY-1, nor do we have any concrete reason for believing that such pressures would be of such avail.

16. AMBIDDY-1's intense love of country strikes me as unfeigned. In the light of his resistance record and feats of personal sacrifice, we doubt whether he could consciously bring himself to harming Cuba. His hatred of Castro stems in the main from the latter's betrayal of the revolution. AMBIDDY-1 frequently mentions Cuba's subversience to the USSR as the darkest betrayal of all, but also voices exception to other aspects of Castro's tyranny.

17. Can we take AMBIDDY-1's professions of faith in democratic principles and the Constitution of 1940 at face value? I submit that we not do so as long as we are unable


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 197

SECRET

to fathom the bedrock of his political convictions. I am
reluctant to accept his writings and the program of the INR
as a valid base for judgement in this regard. In the final
analysis, it may turn out that what animates AMBIDDY-1 in his
unwavering opposition to Castro is the fact that as long as
Castro is "in" AMBIDDY-1 is likely to remain "out." That,
for purposes of justifying our support to him, may suffice.

18. Our methods of handling AMBIDDY-1 will have to
    remain circumscribed by the imperatives of autonomy. He
    cannot be treated as a controlled agent without making a
    mockery of autonomy.

19. One of the benefits we have reaped from autonomy
    is that the American position vis-a-vis ANWORLD and particularly
    the elements of self-interest which animate us in supporting
    this project can be clearly spelled out without necessarily
    jeopardizing the project.

20. AMBIDDY-1's manifest dependency upon American
    goodwill, while an element of latent control and as such
    recognized by AMBIDDY-1, ought not be kept in the forefront
    of our dealings with him inasmuch as it injects another
    element of instability which forces AMBIDDY-1 to worry about
    his rear whereas he ought be concentrating on his front.
    Too frequent harping on the consequences of American dis-
    pleasure cannot serve to forward our project.

21. AMBIDDY-1 has been known to make quite a fetish
    of his resentment at deceptive promises and broken commit-
    ments. Our record in this respect, while not unblemished,
    is fairly good. We can see no merit in practicing deception
    and such to commend candor in dealings with him. AMBIDDY-1's
    own record of living up to commitments is somewhat marred by
    his shortcomings as an organizer and administrator. There
    have been no instances of demonstrable bad faith. However,
    seeming indications of assent on his part are frequently
    meant to denote no more than that he comprehends what has
    been said.

22. In providing AMBIDDY-1 with political guidance,
    we should strive to relieve him of all preoccupation with
    the vagaries of United States foreign policy and to dis-
    courage sterile demonological speculation.

23. Hopefully, recent realignments within AMWORLD
    will serve to usher in a period of political tranquility

AMWORLD Meeting in Panama, 10 July 1964

SUBJECT: Photographs of Adelaida Padron y Crus

The subject of photographs of ANBIDDT-1's mistress was not raised by him at this meeting. He made no reference to Adelaida, and I did not bring up the subject. I did get the impression on no basis in particular that he was not concerned about the problem of Adelaida and apparently she is settled in Managua and not causing any problems at the moment. As the subject was not discussed, however, I would like to state that as a nebulous personal opinion, not as a reporting of fact.

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

Action Required: FYI

Reference: UFGW-3963, 29 June 1964

1.  WAVE has determined that IDEN presently resides at 881 N.E. 71st Street, Miami. The house she lives in has a "For Sale" sign on it by a real estate broker named Henry Chamberlain whose office is located at 7768 Biscayne Blvd.

2.  WAVE has checked the public records pertaining to the above property and the following information was obtained:

    A. "The property is reported being located at 881 N.E. 71st Street, Lot 124, Washington Place, Plot Book 20, Page 54. The house was built in 1945 and purchased on 4 May 1951 by Miriam C. Humes for $19,000. Miss Humes married John C. McCarthy on 4 October 1961. The couple got a mortgage from First Federal Bank, Miami, for $12,400, at which time the house was appraised for $18,475. McCarthy died on 15 August 1962, and the title is now in the name of Miriam C. McCarthy. She has approximately $6,000-$7,000 in equity. Present mortgage is $11,495.57, and she pays $87.00 per month."

3.  WAVE was unable to obtain any information regarding AMBIDDY-1's interest, if any, in the property. It is possible that he intends to purchase some other property. WAVE will continue to check all leads regarding houses in Miami of interest to AMBIDDY-1 and will inform Headquarters of the results.

# AMWORLD Meeting in Houston, 31 July

SUBJECT: Status of ANBIDDT-1's Parents

ANJAVA-4 stated that heind received in Miani a letter from the Spanish Consul in Cuba that AMBIDDY-1's parents had planned to come out of Cuba before the Pilon raid. Afterwards they felt that it would be too dangerous and had stayed in place. Now orders are out to find them and to pick them up. The Spanish want then to take refuge in the Mexican Embassy at the earliest moment. The Spanish say that they can arrange to deliver the aged couple to the Moxican Embassy. The question is, can we at HQB check with the Mexican Government to try to arrange that they guarantee to receive and afford safe travel to Mexico fer AMBIDDY-1's parents. I agreed to investigate but gave no commitment or real hope of any success.

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

**SUBJECT:** Telephone Conversation Between ANJAVA-4 and Martin Ferrer

**DATE:** 31 July 1964, 1300 hours

1.  ANJAVA-4 complained that the regular budget funds for August had not arrived at their bank and inquired as to the reason for the delay. Martin stated he would check into the matter and Carl would have the explanation at their meeting tonight. In the meantime, A-4 will ask ANWORLD-2 for a loan. A-4 also asked for an itemized account of the deposits still remaining in Bank Account II.

2.  A-4 claimed he spoke to Mr. Bunn recently concerning the exit of ANWORLD personnel from Miami. According to A 4 it is presently impossible for their people to leave.

3.  A-4 asked that we obtain radio cryptographic pads since their supply is running short.

4.  A-4 stated that ADELAIDA is being repaired at their base and, in his opinion, the ship will be able to carry out operations in the early part of August. A-4 suggested that Mr. Mitchell go to the base and talk to Francisco NIM Morales who is handling the repairs on the ADELAIDA. A-4 felt that these are only temporary repairs and the ADELAIDA will have to go into drydock. A-4 believes that a meeting of the minds between Mitchell and Nim would be beneficial on how to best keep the ADELAIDA operational. The undersigned stated he did not know if this would be possible for security reasons and the results would be passed through Carl.

5.  A-4 stated he had received the spare parts for the 50 caliber machine guns and the 20 mm. cannons.

ANWORLD Meeting in Panama City, 8 August 1964

SUBJECT: Parents of ANBIDDT-1

In connection with his parents I told AMBIDOT-1 that my HQS had investigated the possibility of intercession with Mexico in their behalf. Our considered opinion was that this would not serve a useful purpose and might be counter-productive. The relations with Mexico are strained at present because of their adverse vote in the OAS meeting and my people could see no way in which they could intercede without directly indicating an official U. S. Government interest in AMBIDDY-1 himself. He agreed that this was probably the situation. He asked only if in my opinion we might be able to assist in expediting their entry into the United States as refugees seeking asylum in case they were able to make their way to Mexico. I stated that in my opinion we would be able to assist in such a situation.

SEPARATE COVER ATTACHMENT TO:
UFGA-14759, 21 August 1964.

SUBJECT: Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa
DATE : 15 July 1964
FROM : Carlos A. RIVERA

A few days ago I was able to read a report on the activities in large scale of Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa, and the beginning of his intimate relations with his present mistress.

Of this report I can mention the most outstanding passages I had to memorize them.

"Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa takes his first steps in the public life as Political Sargent of the 'Partido del Pueblo Libre' (Party of the Free People) whose leader at that time was Dr. Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling.

Later he directed his activities in the fight against General DATISTA, going in the Sierra Maestra where he was apointed Lieutenant by Major Humberto SORI-MARIN.

He was appointed Lieutenant because of his friendship with Major SORI-MARIN, because he was catholic, and because of the lack of trained persons in the Sierra Maestra.

There are more news on Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa when he published the open letter in the newspaper "Avance" denouncing the Castro Regime. The letter was published after he left Cuba, while in Exilo in Maxico.

In answering, the CASTRO Regime accuses him of having stolen funds from the Cooperative of which he had charge. This was certified by his friend Major Humberto SORI-MARIN.

When he arrives in the USA, that is in Miami, Florida, he is a guest of Mr. Ricardo LORIE and Mr. Michael YABOR.

An argument begins within the MRR, in which there are two sides, cne includes Ricardo LORIE and Michael YABOR, and the

![GROUP 1 Excluded from automatic downgrading and declassification]

DESENSITIZED CS COPY
SECRET/RYBАТ


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 214

SECRET/RYBAT

other Dr. Manuel ARTINE Buesa and Miss Pepita Riera.

This argument becomes stronger because of the appointment of the MRR Delegate to the Democratic Revolutionary Front.

Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa aspires with all his strength and intrigues to this position.

He seeks the help of Mr. "Macko" BAQUER, who is said to belong to the CIA and who at the same time supports the FRD (DRF).

He holds a meeting with Mr. SANJENIS in the Cafeteria Dough-Nuts, at 8 and 33 Ave., SW.

Later, at a luncheon at the home of Mr. SANJENIS, in Fort Lauderdale, he obtains the support of Manuel VILLAFANA, Pepita RIERA, SANJENIS, and Mr. PAULA, who agree to help him in his plans

Nevertheless, he continues to look for support and tries with the BATISTA sector, maintaining reunions with MUJAL, Chile MENDOZA and Engineer BADIA.

The plans of the Council are being completed as far as the camps in Guatemala, etc., and in order to get the control on the civil and military sections, due to his excessive ambitions, he tries and obtains the support of the following persons: Col. RASCO, Dr. SARDINAS, Col. Orlando PIEDRA, Miguel SUAREZ Fernandez, Caho HERMIDA, Laureano BATISTA Falla and Mr. Juan MESA, who is said to be a CIA representative. It is common understanding that this gentleman has helped him quite a bit.

He also receives the help of the Catholic Front through Father GONZALE? Posada and Father LLORENTE, who refused it at a beginning.

With all this in his hands, he obtains the control of the military phase and appoints officers of his trust to the commanding posts in Guatemala, such as the brothers San Roman, SUEIRAS, Eneido OLIVA, Andrew Jr., Manuel VILLAFANA and Carol.

After the disaster of the Bay of Pigs and the return to Miami, he continues with his activities, taking active part in the Orange Bowl act, where President John F. KENNEDY 18 presented with the "false" banner of the Brigade 2506.

SECRET/RYBAT


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 215

-3-

That banner was never, at any time, in front of the Bay of
Pigs, but came from Guatemala, brought by MORO-MOLINET and which
-bears his signature on one corner.

The Government of the USA was advised that they would make
a political play with this banner, so it is returned to Fort
Bernnet, and is later destroyed by true revolutionaries.

Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa has had contact with the BIRCH Society,
group of crazy Nazi who is an infiltree of the Communists.

There are reports that his father has been a communist for
years in a department of Las Villas Province.

Beginning of his relations with his present mistress and date on
several figures forming his group.

A certain morning Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa visits the Restaur-
ant Rancho Luna, at 8 and 9 Ave., SW, accompanied by his chauffeur,
BASULTO.

Casually or prearranged, he meets Mr. Edgar SOPO Granda,
friend of Dr. ARTIME and member of the Brigade 2506. (This young
man is the son of a Navy officer under BATISTA, who committed
suicide in La Cabana at the beginning of the Revolution.)

SOPA Granda was in the company of his close friend Aida PEREZ
Pozo, who in turn was in the company of her "intimate" friends
Juana MANUELA and Adelaida PADRON.

At this meeting Dr. ARTIME and Adelaida PADRON liked each
other, and the great idyl is born.

Dr. ARTIME set up a house for Mrs. Adelaida PADRON on 71 NE
6 Ave., where she lives with her two smaller children by her first
marriage to Major Roger ROJAS Lavernia. It is rumored in the
circles close to this couple that Dr. ARTIME will soon marry this
woman.

These those women: Adelaida PADRON, Juana MANUELA, Aida PEREZ
Pozo, are known for their sexual deviations, that is, they are
three famous lesbians.

They began to visit the MRR offices, and several of its
members complained because of their lack of morals.

Nevertheless, Mrs. Aida PEREZ Pozo was assigned in the
Intelligence department of the MRR with a salary of $100.00 per
month. It is rumored this was because of her close friendship
with Adelaida PADRON and ARTIME.

Adelaida PADRON:

Of humble family, she is known as servant of Mrs. Maria Luisa
GOMEZ-MENA, famous lesbian of the high society of Cuba.

She is her favorite servant and takes her along in her trips
to Europe, having great regards for her.

At the time that Adelaida PADRON was working for Mrs. Ma.
Luisa GOMEZ-MENA, the chauffeur of the latter was a brother of
the well known lesbian, Mrs. Luica CANO, better known by the
nickname of "La Campeona" (The Champion).

This is the reason for the great friendship between Adelaida
PADRON and Lucia CANO - "La Campeona".

Adelaida PADRON is also a close friend of Flor de Lotto
LARRUA and Toni LAVERNIA, fumous artists in Cuba..

Adelaide PADRON has arrived to her corruption. She boasts
of having had intimate contacts with leading women of the Cuban
society.

While she was still married to Major Roger ROJAS, she gave
a party at her house at 445 NE & 30 Ave., Miami, where shong the
approximately thirty persons who assisted, there were about fifteen
lesbians and about five homosexuals. There is a picture of this
party in the "Revista Farandula", ', published about one sud a half
years ago.

General Fulgencio BATISTA was the witness at the wedding of
then Lieutenant Roger ROJAS Lavernia and "Miss" Adelaida PADRON.

This wedding took place with great roar in the Night-Club
Tropicana, of Havana, Cuba.

It is said that Adelaida PADRON maintained intimate relations

DESENSITIZED

with General BATISTA, and that it is even certain that one of her sons is of the General.

Later Adelaida PADRON gets the divorce and maintains intimate relations with Mr. Pedrito SUAREZ.

Mr. Pedrito SUAREZ was a candidate for Mayor of Marianao and is a close friend of Dr. Rolando MASFERRER.

At present Mr. SUAREZ has intimate relations with a woman named YOLANDA.

Mr. SUAREZ requested that Adelaida PADRON return a Chevrolet Belair, 1953, to him, since he bought it, but she does not return it because she says that "it is in her name and it is hers".

Mr. SUAREZ at this time has a business of fruit seeds in Homestead, Florida.

Although Adelaida PADRON maintains "intimate" relations with several of her girl friends in Miami, she has confessed that the one she likes completely is her "intimate girl friend", the wife of Dr. Pedro RAMOS, well known doctor who resides in Miami, Florida.

Dr. Pedro RAMOS resides at 213 NW 50 St., Miami, Florida.

Victoria PADRON:

She is the sister of Adelaida PADRON. She is tied in this matter because whe introduced and directs all of her sister's activities.

Victoria PADRON is married to an Italian-American whose name is unknown.

Victoria PADRON lives in common-law with Mr. Raul GRANDA, married, ex-chief of the Military G-1 in the era of General BATISTA.

According to what Aida PEREZ Pozo informed to Mr. Manolin GARCIA, when the counter-revolution will succeed, Mr. Raul GRANDA will occupy his post because it is a family affair through ARTIME, Adelaida, etc.

NOTE: In all this love intrigue around Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa, there could be the influence of two factors: either the infiltration of BATISTA elements, as almost all the components of the groups have some link with him; or else infiltrees of Castroites who work in the USA, since there are involved the relatives of Lucia CANO, who are communists and still in Cuba. There is also the link of Adelaida PADRON's sister with Major William GALVEZ.

RYBAT/TYPIC/ANWORLD
Reports on AMBIDDY/1 Activities

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

REFERENCE:

None.

1.  The Station continues to receive numerous reports on AMBIDDY/1 activities. Most are fragmentary and based on stories which someone has heard about town but invariably cannot be traced to exact sources. Some of these reports are as follows:

a. AMRAZZ/1. The departure of AMBIDDY/1 and his group from the WAVE area was due to pressure from ODACID. This action was the result of the publicity generated by AMWORLD after their successful operation. The departure did not signify a loss of aid to AMWORLD from ODYOKE. The exit of AMYUM/19 from AMWORLD was due to his dissatisfaction with AMBIDDY/1's immoralities. It is supposed that AMYUM/19 is a spokesman in this regard for the AGRUPACION CATOLICA. AMBIDDY/1 is accused of leading a licentious life for some time; having a mistress who was formerly a mistress of Batista; and buying a house and presenting it to this woman. It is also reported that he will marry this woman soon.

b. AMRAZZ/1. Carlos MONTANER advised that AMBIDDY/1 has almost run out of funds and that his group will soon be liquidated.

c. AMSHADY/1. The talk around town is that AMBIDDY/1 is now married to his girl friend. However, he is still living with a male friend and she is still living with a girl friend.

# ANWORLD Meeting in New York, 6 October 1964

SUBJECT: ANWORID Contingency Plans

1. ANJAVA-4 said that AMBIDDY-1 was very enthusiastic about the AMEIJEIRAS operation and felt this was the real key to success of our program to overthrow the Castro regime. He is prepared to concentrate on this operation completely for the immediate future.

2. I asked A-4 if they had done any planning on the basis that the AMEIJEIRAS operation might not pan out. Be asked me directly whether a decision had been made to continue or to cut off support to AMWORLD. I told him that a decision had not been made but that my Headquarters vas very interested in the outcome of the AMEIJEIRAS operation on which he was working. He recognized the isportance of this operation and stated that he and A-1 had conjectured that future support to AMWORLD might be contingent on success or failure of their handling of that case. I did not confirm or deny this point but told his that the organisation would surely be happy if they were able to handle it with success.

3. A-4 then explained that he and A-1 had spent considerable time discussing the future of their progran and their prospects vis a vis the Agency. He said that in their opinion one of two things would happen; either the AMEIJEIRAS operation would pay off in which case they would be able to continue to operate with Agency support but with a diversion of major objectives or the operation would peter out, in which case they would have to consider what to do without Agency support. He said that A-1 was not only prepared to accept e diversion of primary objective but felt that present circumstances dictated the wisdom of such a move. However, both of them feel that their present paramilitary program must be continued, not because it is crucial to the outcome of the Cuban situation, but because the strength which they exhibit through these operations is the only attraction to AMWORLD that has caused the AMEIJEIRAS group to contact thom.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 226

4. In case the AMEIJEIRAS operation fails to develop, and the Agency should decide to cut off support to AMWORLD, A-4 says they will continue to try to operate as long as they can. He said that instead of 200 people they might be operating with 20, but they could do something. So long as they have the hardware with which to operate they can "sell" operations each time. For example, he said, they would go to Cuban exiles, to Venezuela, to American businessmen, etc. and would tell them, "The October operation will cost $25,000. If you will underwrite it we will dedicate it to you and run it in your name." He feels this would carry them for a few months provided they can run a few successful operations.

5. A-4 said that when the support ran out the hardware vas all gone, and there was nothing left with which to operate, A-1 would take 12 or 15 of his hard core followers and go into the Escambray in Las Villas to make one last ditch effort. I asked him if A-1 felt he would have any chance of a success and A-4 stated that should such a state come to pass, A-l would definitely go in with the expectation of being run down eventually and shot but that he would do this in order to go out in a blaze of glory and to continue to serve as a martyr. A-4 said there was absolutely no doubt in his mind that A-1 would follow this course, that he had a hero compulsion and a martyr complex and was completely without fear of death. A-4 again mentioned an idea held by A-l that he will not live past 29 January 1965 (his birthday) because he is convinced that he is destined to reach the peak moment of his life during his 33rd year (as did Jesus Christ) and does not expect to live beyond that time.

6. I asked A-4 where he, personally, stood in such a future undertaking. He said that he was no hero but he had dedicated seven years of his life as a schoolboy and young man to Cuban independence, and he could not stop now. He would not go in deliberately to die as a martyr, but he would continue with his work doing the best he could with whatever means he could come by. He stated, "A-l is not such a leader as Tony VARONA who can separate himself completely from the struggle and go out to sell used cars. A-1 cannot exist in a life which is routine and without personal power. He will die first even in a suicidal mission." A-4 stated that

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 227

-3-

he, himself, was of a different nature but that it would be just as impossible for him to go to a routine type of work and leave the work of liberation of his country.

7. I asked A-4 what ANWORLD would do if they were able to commence operations again. He said they had two targets on the north coast test they would like to hit when they have another chance. One is Puerto Vita, the other is Manati. They have target studies on Puerto Vita and have Just recruited a refugee from Hanati who knows the area thoroughly and brought out a large number of photographs of the target with him from Cuba. Unfortunately some of then were confiscated by U. S. Customs when he came through Niani, but there were still enough remaining to plan an operation. He asked if we might be able to help recover the confiscated photos. I told him that if approval to recommence operations vas given, I was sure we could do so. In the seantine, I was, of course, not authorized to discuss possible future operations but/interested in what AMWORLD was thinking along these lines. A-4 understood our position with the current suspension of operations.

1.  AMBIDDY-1 said he had met yesterday with a news- paperman named Robert Stark of the London Times. A-1 first knew Stark during his imprisonment after the Bay of Pigs and claims Stark was one of the few correspondents who was allowed to interview the prisoners. Acctoding to A-1 Stark and thegovernor of the Bahamas are involved in smuggling to and from Cuba. Stark smuggles salt pork into Oriente Province and brings out rum and cigars. Stark is the owner of an LCM (Andros Engineer) and an LCU (Charles- town). While A-1 was jotting down the names of the vessels Stark said, "Nowdon't go sinking my ships." A-l replied, "We don't sink anyone's ships." Stark is leaving today for Canada to purchase fire bricks for sugar centrals in Cuba. Stark advised A-1 that Ramon Castro, Fidel's brother, would like to defect. Stark is willing to assist Ramon exfiltrate clandestinely provided that A-1 supply a boat to meet the exfiltrating party somewhere in the open seas. Before A-1 commits his organization to suci a plan he would like to have Headquarters investigate Stark. A-1 expects to meet Stark within a week and give him an answer at that time.

2.  A-1 has received a report from his base that ALBUERNE is involved in a narcotics and numbers racket based in Miami. A-1 is requesting that the complete report be forwarded to Miami in order to turn it over to us.

He will then return to New York where he will talk to some New York businessmen and attempt to collect financial support for his organizati on.

4. AMWORLD has been notified by the Justice Department that they have to register as agents of a foreign government. Manolin Hernandez drafted a letter in reply objecting to being called "agents of a foreign government." A-l maintains that his organization does not report to or is responsible to any other government, etc. A-1 was asked to send us a copy of their reply for our records.

5. A-1 commented he has hired Luis PRIETO Portar to head the AMWORLD "Brain Trust."

3 November 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Between AMBIDDY-1
and Martin Ferrer

DATE : 2 November 1964, 2100 hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 stated that he, AMWORLD-2 and John Monahan met some wealthy, American businessmen on 1 November. One of the Americans was the President of the American Medical Association in Miami who promised AMWORLD medical supplies. A-1 mentioned that John Monahan spoke eloquently before the group on behalf of AMWORLD. The undersigned mentioned to A-1 that unlike Cuban businessmen, one has to take a more direct approach with American businessmen as far as money is concerned. A-1 said the reason he has not made a direct pitch for money is because he does not want to take the same approach other exile organizations do. A-1 felt he would have better success in getting a little from alot of people instead of alot from a few.

2. According to A-1, AMJAVA-4 will be leaving Thursday for Nicaragua.

3. A-1 advised that Nilo Messer and Antonio Sanz are now in Spain. Antonio Sanz will return after placing Nilo in contact with appropriate people in Spain. A-1 expects to meet with a representative of the dissident group within the next two weeks. A-1 did not elaborate as to the reason for his expectation.

delayed due to expired visas. A-1 has obtained the necessary information for President Reid concerning the purchase of twelve Swifts. This information will be sent with the three man group. When asked why President Reid has not negotiated the purchase of the Swifts himself, A-1 stated Reid tried to but found embezzling within his group. President Reid wants to show the naval group he can purchase the Swifts on his own.

6. A-1 expects the Philco training school to begin on 3 November. Approximately 25 AMWORLDERS will attend the school. A-1 said he had submitted a list of needed spare parts to Philco but he has not received a reply. A-l is checking other radio corporations to obtain the lowest possible prices.

7. The MV SANTA MARIA is anchored off Monkey Point and according to A-l is in top notch condition.

8. A-1 said he terminated his contract with station WRUL in New York. A-1 intends to use the Dominican Republic to beam long-wave programs to Cuba.

DATE : 3 November 1964 at 2130

1. After several unsuccessful attempts I was finally able to contact AMBIDDY-1 and advise him that Carl wold be unable to meet him at the agreed time. I informed A-1 that Carl would contact him at 0900 on 4 November and make arrangements for their meeting.

2. A-1 said he had received confirmation that the Philco school had started on 2 November.

3. During this non-operational period A-1 is having all his vessels checked out to see that they will be in good operational condition. A-1 specifically alluded to the LCM's that are presently being overhauled. The Swift GITANA is also undergoing maintenance repairs.

4. Besides setting up Nilo Messer as AMWORLD's liaison to the dissident group, Antonio Sanz is inquiring as to the departure date of the RIO CAOGAO, A-1 intends to broach the topic of attacking the CAONAO with Carl. A-1 stated that he hopes that Carl will have a final decision for him on the CAONAO

5. Feeling that A-1 was probing for a sign as to what decision has been made on the CAONAO, I changed the subject and asked A-1 if he was watching the election: returns. A-1

stated that he was, and the election was progressing nicely. Judging from the tone of A-l's voice, he apparently feels that the re-election of President Johnson and the election of Robert Kennedy would guarantee the continuation of AMWORLD.

1.  AMBIDDY-1 reported that Antonio Sanz returned from
    Spain last night (11 Nov) and according to Sanz a representative
    of the dissident group will be leaving for Spain on 15 Nov.
    Sanz does not have the name of the representative, however, all
    indications point to Dr. Faustino Perez. A-1 has only talked
    to Sanz briefly by phone and therefore did not have all the
    details of Sanz trip.

2.  According to A-1 Sanz talked to the captain of the
    Caonao and the captain is more willing than ever to deliver the
    ship to AMWORLD. The Caonao will leave Spain on 16 Nov.
    A-1 said he would like a reading from Carl on the status of
    the Caonao operation.

3.  A-1 stated that some of his men who were formerly
    in the U. S. Army are being recalled. A-1 requested that we
    do whatever possible to remedy this situation. A-1 was
    advised to submit a list of names of the individuals involved
    and we waild review the problem.

4.  Santiago Alvarez Rodriguez is encountering difficulties
    with I&NS in leaving the U. S. A-1 did not elaborate as to the
    difficulty, however, it appears to be a matter of having
    the proper papers.

5.  A-1 said he is very pleased by the intelligence
    section in Miami, particularly the debriefing of Cuban exiles.
    A-1. promised to give Headquarters copies of all intelli-
    gence reports.

6. A-1 commented that there is a possibility that AMWORLD may get a free ship from Babun. A-1 feels that by acting as an intermediary for the JOANNE, Babun will give AMWORLD another ship after obtaining possession of the JOANNE.

7. A-1 expects to leave within the next few days for Central America. He will see AMJAVA-4 and get up-to-date reading on the situation at the camps and obtain the inventory from A-4. A-1 would like to see Carl in the U. S. rather than in Panama.

8. A-1 claimed that the $18,000 balance due on the JOANNE repairs had been sent to Ramsey Scarlett.

9. A-1 was advised that Carl would meet him tonight (12 Nov) in West Palm Beach. A-1 should make reservations at a motel in that city and call Headquarters at 1600 hours today with the name of the motel.

1.  AMBIDDY-1 expects to leave on 17 November for Costa Rica. He has received an urgent message that Cornelio Orlich would like to talk to him. A-1 hopes to return to Miami as soon as possible to be on call for the meeting with representative of the dissident group.

2.  ANJAVA-4 is leaving on the same flight as A-1 but will go directly to Managua. A-4 would prefer to meet with Carl on 19 November in Panama. A-1 was requested to tell A-4 to bring the plans for Jucaro, Casilda, Santa Cruz del Sur and Guayabal to the Panama meeting. A-1 will tell A-4 the address of the Panama safehouse.

3.  A-l said he received word from Managua that several shots were fired at his private automobile yesterday (15 November) in Managua. Fortunately the bullets went astray and the driver was unharmed. The assailant or assailants escaped.

4.  According to A-l approximately a week or so ago the Guardia Fiscal in Parismina, which is near Tortuguero, saw a light out at sea. When they went to see what it was they saw a submarine. A-l also claims that the U.S. Army is in that area building a tower of scmo sort.

5.  A-1 believes the weapons ordered by Costa Rica from the U.S. were requested by Pepe Figueres under the pretext that of turning them over to Manolo Ray. A-1 opined that some may be given to Ray but a great bulk of the arms would be kept by Figueres.

1. AMBIDDY-1 stated William King will advise Philco today that AMWORLD no longer wished to employ Jim Lee. A-1 sent a message to the base for Lee to return to the U. S.

2. A-1 reported he received a call from Nilo Messer who said that Robreno wished to see AMJAVA-4 to make arrangements for the "summit" meeting. It appeared to A-l that the representative of the dissident group in Spain wants to deal with a higher ranking person than Nilo Messer. Nilo has received indications that the representative has already left Cuba and is somewhere in Europe on a shopping spree. Mr. Santell suggested perhaps it would be best for AMJAVA-4 to arrange the meeting in Paris rather than in Spain. A-1 agreed. AMJAVA-4 will probably leave for Spain on 21 November after his meeting with Carl.

3. A-1 was advised that HQS had received a report stating Guayo is in possession of photographs presumed to be on the ARANZAZU affair that were not turned over to AMWORLD for censorship. A-1 stated that Guayo was searched thoroughly after the ARANZAZU affair and doubts he has photographs in his possession unbeknownst to AMWORLD, however, A-l will investigate. We advised A-1 we had no way of checking the veracity of the report, however, wanted to alert him of the possibility. A-1 said Guayo is now in Caracas working for "Bbhemia Libre."

4. A-1 plans to leave for Costa Rica on 19 November. We informed him that one of the topics which Cornelio Orlich may discuss is the increasing publicity being generated by the training of Cuban exiles in that country.

5. A-1 was asked to call HQS on his return from Costa Rica.

Norman Santell and Martin Ferrer

DATE : 20 November 1964, 2100 hours

1. AMBIDDY-1 called to say he had just returned from
   Costa Rica where he spoke to President Orlich and his brother.
   The Orlichs made no mention of expelling A-l, but, to the
   contrary, are willing to continue to support AMWORLD. The
   only request made by President Orlich was that the arms barge
   be taken out of Costa Rica for fear the Communists would
   learn of its existence. A-1 said he will comply.

2. The topic of conversation quickly changed to the
   newspaper article by Hal Hendrix which greeted A-1 upon his
   arrival from Costa Rica about A-1 involvement in smuggling
   activities in Costa Rica. We informed A-1 that Al Burt had
   intended to publish a similar story but was scooped by Hendrix.
   We asked A-1 what he thought of the idea of having President
   Orlich issue a complete denial as soon as possible of A-l's
   smuggling activities ia Costa Rica, A-l felt a presidential
   denial was essential in counteracting this damaging publicity.
   A-1 stated he would call President Orlich the first thing in
   the morning on this matter. Another suggestion to neutralize
   Hendrix's story was for A-1 to see Al Burt as soon as possible
   and categorically deny the story. If need be A-i might want
   to invite Burt to Costa kica to speak to President Orlich and
   confirm A-l's side of the story.

DATE : 21 November 1964, 1030 hours

1.  The undersigned telephoned AMBIDDY-1 to see if he had an opportunity to speak with President Orlich. A-1 stated he was unable to reach the President but did speak to the President's secretary. The secretary advised A-l that he was unaware of the Hendrix story but he assured A-l the entire story' would be denied. A-1 informed Headquarters that he has sent Manolin Hernandez with a copy of the story to see President Orlich. A-1 commented that the initial reaction in Miami to the story was one of indignation toward Hendrix.

2.  When we called A-1, he was on his way to see Al Burt. A-1 had already talked to Burt by phone and they had made an appointment to discuss the entire matter this morning. Burt told A-1 on the phone that rumors concerning A-l's activity had reached him. A-l said he would tell Burt that President Orlich would issue a complete denial of the Hendrix allegations. A-1 was cautioned not to forget that Burt is primarily a newspaperman and therefore to be on guard as to what he tells Burt.

3.  A-1 was advised to take a fire stand against Philco concerning Jim Lee. Lee should be sent back to the U. S. as soon as possible. A-1 was requested to reject any proposals by Philco for consultations in Miami or Central America con- cerning Lee. A-1 should tell King to telephone Philco on Monday (23 Nov) and make it quite clear AMWORLD cannot afforů to pay needless travelling expenses of Philco representatives. King should also ask for a price list for the spare parts. If Philco cannot comply, A-1 was advised 18/them he will buy his spare parts elsewhere.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Between AMBIDDY-1 and Dick

DATE: 21 November 1964, 1600 hours

1. At 1600 hours, 21 November 1964, I complied with AMBIDDY-1's request relayed through the Security Office that he be called on Franklin 3-1568 in Miami.

2. AMBIDDY-1 described reports reaching him of mysterious phone calls being received by various Cubans in Miami, mostly MRR personnel or wives of MRR members. These calls started during the morning of 21 November. The caller was a North American who spoke Spanish and gave his name as "Bill Jones." The caller sought in each case to solicit derogatory information about AMBIDDY-1, with particular emphasis on A-l's alleged participation in smuggling activities. The caller offered money (A-l did not know how much) for derogatory information.

3. A-1 mentioned two persons who received calls: AMYUM-19 and the wife of Manolin Hernandez. In addition to smuggling, A-19 was also asked if the reason he broke with A-l was because of the marriages of AMJAVA-4 or A-1. A-19 denied these allegations to the caller.

4. A-1 said that the story spreading through Miami as a result of these calls is that the U.S. Government -- and probably CIA specifically -- was attempting to discredit A-l as a basis for denouncing him. A-l was obviously distressed by these speculations, and in reporting them he was in reality asking the question. I gave him my unequivocal assurance that the U.S. Government was not responsible for the calls..

5. I asked A-l who he thought was responsible and he said "maybe the Miami Herald." A-l said that he had seen Al Burt earlier in the day (Saturday, 21 November) and that Burt was angry because he felt that the recent


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 257

-2-

TV coverage of the AMWORLD camps and activities in Central
America was a scoop to which he was rightfully entitled
because of a prior agreement with AMBIDDY-1. A-1 gave
Burt his side of the stories being circulated about
ANWORLD's contraband activities. A-1 felt that he
made an impression. Burt was particularly interested
in a denial of these charges which A-l told Burt would
be issued very soon by the President of Costa Rica (see
following paragraph). A-l said he thought that he may
have mollified Burt somewhat by having the meeting and
by promising him scoops in the future, but that Burt
still holds a grudge against him.

6. AMBIDDY-1 said he was expecting momentarily
   a call from Manolin Hernandez in San Jose. Hopefully,
   Hernandez' call would be to read a public letter from
   President Orlich officially denying the presence of
   ANWORLD training camps in Costa Rica and disavowing
   charges that A-l or his people were involved in smuggling.
   Orlich promised A-l to issue such a letter. When he gets
   a copy of this letter A-l intends to hold a press
   conference and use it as the heart of his effort to set
   the record straight about charges that AMWORLD is involved
   in running contraband.

7. I told A-1 that we would look into his report on
   the mysterious phone calls and that we would let him know
   what we find out.

The meeting was attended ANCARBON-1, ANBIDDY-1, a Cuban known as Milo Jesus MESSER Pujol (21-294655), Father *BAJEUX and Sylvia WADESTRANDT. After a preliminary series of discussions, &HBIDDY-1 adjourned to another. Yoon of the Diederich house to talk privately with Father Bajoux and Sylvia Wadestrandt. At the end of this private meeting, AMCARD-1 had an opportunity to talk with AMBIDDY-1. As a result, AMCAN-1 learned that, as of 18 October 1964, it was AMBIDDY-1's intention to help the Haitians in their fight against Duvalier. AMBIDDY-1 believed that be could furnish the arms and the transportation for the invasion of Haiti by Haitian exiles. AidBigy-1 was also talking abcut committing some of his troops to such an invasion as he felt that, if he were successful in this venture, he could obtain significant base rights for his organizatiwn in Haiti. These bases would in turn be used by AMBIDDT-1's operations against PERUMKи.

2. On the morning of 19 October 1964, ANCARBON-1 had an opportunity to talk in Santo Domingo with ruban called Rafael Garcia who is AMBIDDY-1's representative in the Dominican Republic.

1. I telephoned Subject in Miami and introduced myself as "Andres" and indicated that I was calling for "Carlos" who wished to know what Subject wanted as per his telephone call to "Martin" on the previous Friday.

2. Subject indicated that he had three messages he wished to deliver and they were as follows:

a. The President of Panama had given his whole-hearted consent to "Manolin" (Hernandez) in helping them establish their operations in Panama. This message was then relayed to "Carlos" (Jenkins) who was listening in on the conversation.

b. Subject then stated that he had promised to pay the passage of the individuals who were supposed to take part in the meeting set for 10 December. He indicated that he was worried since he had not heard from the "Flechero." This was related to Carlos who indicated that the money had been approved but as yet had not been forwarded to the bank. This information was relayed to A-1 and he seemed satisfied.

c. Subject stated that he was leaving for Nicaragua tomorrow. He also asked if we had read his message to the base. I said that we had not and he then gave me the gist of his message to the effect that the "foreign power" had as yet not vetoed their plans but that in the event they did, he (A-1) would have to drastically revise his policy of adherence to their views. Subject stressed that the message vas only to bolster the moral of the men.

A-1 requested that the following portion of A-4's message be passed to appropriate persons: "I (A-4) request the suspension of Operation VICTORIA be reconsidered for the good of future operations because a person who loses faith in operations, believing himself subject to foreign decisions, is a demoralized person." In light of A-4's message, A-1 urged that suspension of Operation VICTORIA be reconsidered. I assured A-l that his message would be delivered.

2. DC/WH/SA was notified of the above message. On the instructions of DC/WH/SA the undersigned called A-1 and advised him that the contents of his conversations with Mr. Santell (Sanchez) on 5 December were still valid and our position regarding Operation VICTORIA remained the same.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Juan Antonio CANCELA Gomes (201-758689)
Possible Connection with Cuban G-2

1. On 7 December 1964 during the course of a telephone conversation with AMBIDDY-1, he indicated that it was possible that Subject was connected with the Cuban G-2. AMBIDDY-1 suspects that CANCELA was sent by the G-2 to penetrate the ANYUM training camps.

2. Subject spent one month at the training camps and then asked to return to Miami. Upon his return to Miami he then made plans to travel to Nassau alleging that he had to go to Nassau in order to obtain a permanent visa to enter the U.S. AMBIDDY-1 had this story checked out with the U.S. I&NS and discovered that this was not necessary to enter the country on a permanent basis. AMBIDDY-1 therefore concluded that Subject was attempting to go to Nassau and eventually work his way back to Cuba.

3. No further information was obtained on this matter.
